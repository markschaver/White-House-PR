<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Vice President Harris To Make Announcement During White House Event</em> <em>March 16<sup>th</sup>, 2022</em></p>



<p>In the last three months, more than one-third of our country’s Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) have received bomb threats. While, thankfully, no explosive devices were found on any of these campuses, significant and lasting damage has been done by threatening the safety and security of the students, faculty, and staff at these institutions. As a result of these threats, learning has been disrupted, critical resources have been diverted to emergency response, and there has been an increased burden on already overwhelmed campus mental health systems. HBCU students – already experiencing negative impacts from the pandemic such as lingering effects of illness, trauma, and basic needs insecurities – are now experiencing additional stress and anxiety because of these bomb threats that can negatively affect their academic success.</p>



<p>It is important to view these recent and repeated threats through both the lens of the present day as well as our country’s history. HBCUs were founded to educate Black people in an America that refused to accept them as full human beings and prevented them – because of racial discrimination – from attending other colleges. Threats to the education and well-being of Black Americans and HBCUs are an unfortunate part of American history. The bomb threats that we witnessed in January, each week in February – Black History Month, and this month are reminiscent of the attempts during the Civil Rights Era to intimidate and provoke fear in Black Americans.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Biden-Harris Administration is taking a whole-of-government approach in responding to these threats and ensuring the safety and well-being of students, staff, and faculty. Immediately following the first reports of the threats, Education Secretary Cardona and Homeland Security Secretary Mayorkas hosted a briefing with more than 40 presidents of HBCUs from across the nation to share information on grant programs, training resources, and other tools available to HBCUs to strengthen campus safety and security. Leaders from the Department of Education (ED) and other federal agencies have visited HBCU campuses. During these visits, federal officials heard firsthand about the need to modernize and update their operations, including campus safety and security, as well as the need for more resources to help bolster mental health services due to increased apprehension across the campus community.</p>



<p>Today, in response to these needs, Vice President Kamala Harris is announcing that HBCUs that have recently experienced a bomb threat resulting in a disruption to the campus learning environment are eligible for grant funds. These grant funds are from the Project School Emergency Response to Violence (Project SERV) program at ED. Project SERV provides short-term, immediate funding for local educational agencies and institutions of higher education that have experienced a violent or traumatic incident to assist in restoring a safe environment conducive to learning.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ED will work with the HBCUs that have received recent bomb threats to determine if Project SERV can help get funds to their campuses for immediate needs, such as targeted mental health resources or enhanced security, to restore the learning environment on their campuses. ED is able to provide this funding to HBCUs to ensure students feel safe on their campuses. ED staff will work with each HBCU to help determine their specific immediate needs. Awards typically range from $50,000 to $150,000 per school.</p>



<p>In addition to the short-term funds provided through Project SERV, the Biden-Harris Administration is providing HBCUs a compendium of resources that are available across the federal government – from ED, Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Homeland Security, and Department of Justice – to help with long-term improvements to campus mental health programs, campus safety, and emergency management planning and response. The resource guide offers a centralized source of information on grant programs and technical assistance activities across federal agencies.</p>



<p>These announcements today build off the historic investments and support the Biden-Harris Administration has already delivered to HBCUs – $5.8 billion in total to date, including more than $2.7 billion in American Rescue Plan funding – to ameliorate chronic underfunding and help address critical needs brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>



<p>Educational opportunity is a fundamental element of the American promise and HBCUs have played an outsized role in securing that opportunity for Black people. As President Biden indicated in Executive Order 14041 – which re-established the White House Initiative on HBCUs – HBCUs have a proud history and legacy of achievement. That legacy continues, with more than 100 HBCUs, located in 19 states, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. Virgin Islands that serve nearly 300,000 students annually. These storied institutions have excelled, in the face of discrimination, and their strength and convictions will not be compromised by these violent bomb threats.<br></p>

<p>One year ago today, eight people, six of them women of Asian descent, were tragically killed by a gunman who attacked three Asian-run businesses. These horrific murders shook communities across America and underscored how far we have to go in this country to fight racism, misogyny, and all forms of hate—and the epidemic of gun violence that enables these extremists.<br><br>In the aftermath of these senseless deaths, the Vice President and I traveled to Atlanta to meet with leaders of the Asian American community. We heard about the terror and anguish that too many Asian Americans have felt since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, when anti-Asian xenophobia, harassment, and violence skyrocketed to alarming levels. Grandparents afraid to leave their homes. Small business owners targeted and gunned down. Families living in fear for their lives just walking down the street in America. It was a stark reminder that anti-Asian violence and discrimination have deep roots in our nation, with Asian American women experiencing the compounded harms of being targeted on account of their race as well as their gender.<br><br>Today, we honor the victims, their families, and the Atlanta community that has shown extraordinary resilience in the face of tragedy. While nothing we do can bring the victims back, their loss has compelled us to reckon with our nation’s long legacy of anti-Asian sentiment and gender-based violence, and recommit ourselves to delivering the full measure of justice, safety, and dignity the Asian American and Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander community and all communities deserve. I was proud to sign the bipartisan COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act into law last May, which dedicated new tools and resources across government and law enforcement to help prevent, track, and respond to acts of hate, along with new Department of Justice grants and other measures to enhance community engagement, empowerment, and education.<br><br>This tragedy is also yet another reminder of the gun violence epidemic. My Administration has taken more executive action to reduce gun violence than any other Administration it its first year. But there is more to do—and Congress must act.<br><br>On this somber anniversary, my Administration remains fully committed to advancing safety, inclusion, and belonging for all Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders—especially the women and girls who disproportionately bear the burdens of hate—and to reducing the gun violence that terrorizes our communities. Together, we must build a future where no one fears violence.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">South Court Auditorium</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Eisenhower Executive Office Building</p>



<p>3:34 P.M. EDT</p>



<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Welcome, everyone, to the White House.  Welcome.  Welcome.  As has been introduced, we are gathered together with really wonderful leaders.  Obviously, you all have been champions, in terms of your skill and your dominance in terms of women&#8217;s soccer, but we are here today because you also have been leaders on an issue that affects most women and has affected most women in the workforce, and it&#8217;s the issue of pay equity.</p>



<p>So, thank you for joining us at the White House for this important discussion, which really is going to center on your leadership &#8212; what you all have done; what you have accomplished; the challenges that you&#8217;ve faced, both personally and professionally, in terms of getting us to this point where we have now seen extraordinary success because of your commitment to the issue and your willingness to be a voice for so many others on and off the field.</p>



<p>So, with that, I want to thank you all.  And of course, we should mention that you have won four World Cup Games and four Olympic golds.  (Applause.)  So &#8212; absolutely. </p>



<p>So, Kelley, let&#8217;s talk &#8212; I want to start with you, because it&#8217;s about being a player rep in the Players Association Union.  And we still see that there are issues throughout the workforce around women being underpaid. </p>



<p>But can you talk a bit about the fight that you all had and the role of the Players Association in reaching the settlement?</p>



<p>MS. O&#8217;HARA:  For sure.  You know, I think a lot of people hear our fight for equal pay and they think compensation, which is definitely what it&#8217;s about.  But there are a lot of other things that we were fighting for. </p>



<p>There was a lot of unequal treatment.  And that came in the form of playing surfaces, travel standards, promotion and investment in the game. </p>



<p>And Julie &#8212; we were actually talking before we got up here &#8212; how far we&#8217;ve come even from when they were playing.  And I don&#8217;t know if you want to mention &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. FOUDY:  A long time ago.</p>



<p>MS. O&#8217;HARA:  &#8212; some things.  Yeah, but &#8212; but all that is to say &#8212; and to answer your question about the Players Association, we were facing all these things.  And I think that the Players Association &#8212; it&#8217;s been around for generations, but we really reinvigorated it in 2017.  And I think that dedicating time to setting it up in a way that we were able to achieve certain things allowed us to realize our collective voice and, like, the power of our unity. </p>



<p>And I think without the Players Association, we wouldn&#8217;t have been able to achieve what we&#8217;ve done in the past couple years. </p>



<p>And although we filed as individuals, not on behalf or with the Players Association, we were able to see it through because of that. </p>



<p>And I&#8217;m really thankful that it did start so long ago and these generations have put in the work.  But, you know, we took the steps to create it the way we needed it, and it allowed us to get it over the line. </p>



<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:  And the Players Association, it&#8217;s a union.</p>



<p>MS. O&#8217;HARA:  Yes.</p>



<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:  It&#8217;s a players&#8217; union.  And so, that meant that you wouldn&#8217;t have to &#8212; even though you filed as individuals, in terms of the lawsuit, that, in terms of your advocacy and the fight for equal pay, you knew that you weren&#8217;t alone.  You all were in it together. </p>



<p>MS. O&#8217;HARA:  For sure.  I think that feeling that unity and recognizing how powerful we were, I think, was a big reason why we were able to keep fighting, because it was not easy. </p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; And so, can you describe what the fight was?&nbsp; And maybe even just talk about what it was before, right?&nbsp; The strengthening of the Players Association and the kind of collective advocacy &#8212; what was it like before then?</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. FOUDY:&nbsp; Well, way back, Kelley and I were discussing &#8212; you know, we were fighting for bagels, you know, after training and having, you know &#8212; &#8220;Everyone put in five bucks, so you can…&#8221;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. CONE:&nbsp; In between two training sessions.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. FOUDY:&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; &#8220;…you can get, you know, bagels and cream cheese.&#8221;&nbsp; Or, &#8220;Hey, can we get a massage therapist?&#8221;&nbsp; Or, &#8220;Hey, can we stay at maybe a little bit nicer hotel?&#8221;&nbsp; I mean, just the basics that you start to hear about, and it festers a little bit more, and, you know, the little things become bigger things.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so, the thing that makes me so proud is this is &#8212; this goes back to the &#8217;90s, of us, you know, threatening to actually strike an Olympics and not play in an Olympics and in locking out because we felt like that was our only leverage we had.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And to see them &#8212; and one of the things we were so cognizant of is, &#8220;Okay, we&#8217;ve got to teach the younger kids what this fight is so that when we&#8217;re gone, they&#8217;re going to carry that baton.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so, when we &#8212; the &#8220;old bags,&#8221; as we call ourselves &#8212; see them take it and really take it to a whole new level &#8212; we were fighting for equitable pay; they&#8217;re fighting for equal pay, as they should be.&nbsp; And it just warms your heart because it&#8217;s not easy.&nbsp; It was incredibly courageous, and it took a ton of energy and time and focus, and they just were locked in on getting it done.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then you have a woman who is the president of U.S. Soccer, who can help them get it over the line.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, it was a full circle moment for a lot of us &#8212; a proud moment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; So, let&#8217;s go to the &#8212; we were talking backstage about the inside-outside game &#8212; right? &#8212; the advocacy from the outside.&nbsp; And then, really most of the reforms and most of the advances that we&#8217;ve ever seen, in terms of equality and the fight &#8212; the ongoing fight for equality &#8212; has required the push from the outside, but it requires also allies, at the very least, on the inside &#8212; if not advocates on the inside, also.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, can you talk a little bit about what that experience was like for you, as a former player, but then being the president and what that meant in terms of the difficulties you must have experienced from the inside, understanding the push from the outside?</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. CONE:&nbsp; Yeah, you know, for me, I feel like it has been over two decades of work.&nbsp; It started off, as Julie said, fighting for bagels between training sessions.&nbsp; And now this larger group of women, through the last two decades, are literally changing the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And for me, I&#8217;m also a coach, so to know that these young girls are now growing up and they can realize their dreams and they&#8217;re going to be fairly compensated for that, I think that&#8217;s why this is so important.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not necessarily for the people sitting here today, but it&#8217;s for the future of not only the future soccer players, but women in general.&nbsp; And I think that&#8217;s why this is important.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why leadership is important.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And getting to your point is, you know &#8212; I sat beside Jules and Bri when we were doing our CBA negotiations.&nbsp; And I don&#8217;t think you can just sit on the outside and keep complaining unless you&#8217;re willing to get inside and help create change.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so, that is why I do what I do.&nbsp; Because I think having people on the inside that understand the players and what it&#8217;s like to be out on the field representing your country and what that means to you, I think, is really important to create change.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But as you said backstage, you know, our work isn&#8217;t done yet.&nbsp; We still have a lot of work to do, both in our sport and in our country and worldwide.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In our sport, I know that I&#8217;m going to have willing partners in CONCACAF and FIFA to spread what we have done here to the rest of the world.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp;&nbsp; And you were just re-elected president, right?</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. CONE:&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Yes, you were.&nbsp; Fantastic.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you mind sharing with us without &#8212; you don&#8217;t have to name names, but &#8212; (laughter) &#8212; what were people in the inside saying about why this hadn&#8217;t happened or where there was resistance?&nbsp; What &#8212; how were they justifying that in their own minds, much less for the &#8212; the best interest of the game and, to your point, what you represent, which is the United States of America?</p>



<p>MS. CONE:&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; You know, I think that &#8212; I think people in my boardroom come at from different perspectives.&nbsp; So not everyone thinks the same thing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think the challenges from the U.S. soccer standpoint was that there were two separate contracts for the men and the women, because the women wanted guaranteed pay, where the men were paid to play.&nbsp; And so, trying to find equal with totally different structures of contracts was forever elusive.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re in CBA &#8212; CBA negotiations right now and trying to get to one structure so it&#8217;s very clear that everything, compensation wise, is equal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And then the other thing is the FIFA World Cup prize money is drastically different.&nbsp; The men&#8217;s World Cup winner for the last World Cup got $38 million for winning it, whereas our women who won the World Cup only received $4 million from FIFA.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, there &#8212; there are already built-in status quo differences that were systemic that we need to keep working to change.</p>



<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; What was the inf- &#8212; and maybe I&#8217;ll go to Briana.&nbsp; What was the inflection point?&nbsp; Like, what &#8212; what started to turn the movement and bring it to the next level?&nbsp;</p>



<p><a>MS. SCURRY:&nbsp; </a>I think what&#8217;s important to note: When you get on the U.S. women&#8217;s national team, you have a dual mandate.&nbsp; The first is superb soccer.&nbsp; I mean, we have the expectation of winning everything.&nbsp; And so, if you think about it from that point of view, in our day, we were expected to win World Cups and Olympic Games.&nbsp; And then, in present day, these amazing women had the same expectation, and we were both able to do that.&nbsp; So every cycle, we&#8217;ve won either the Olympic Games or the World Cup.&nbsp; And so, there&#8217;s that part of it.</p>



<p>And the second part is to fight and raise the bar higher.&nbsp; And so, I think, for me, I&#8217;ve continued to talk about equal pay, even though I don&#8217;t play anymore.&nbsp; And Julie does it; and now Cindy is obviously back in the arena, in a different position, fighting for that as well.&nbsp; But I think, for me, when I read about the team &#8212; and I consider them my team still, even though I haven&#8217;t played with most of them.&nbsp; (Laughter.)</p>



<p>PARTICIPANT:&nbsp; We all do.</p>



<p>MS. SCURRY:&nbsp; We all.&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; I consider it my team too.&nbsp; (Laughter.)</p>



<p>MS. SCURRY:&nbsp;&nbsp; My &#8212; my sisters &#8212; right, your team too.&nbsp; (Laughs.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yeah, when I saw that my team was essentially sticking their necks out there like we did with the boycott in ’95 &#8212; basically putting our Olympic dreams on the line.&nbsp; For me, I wanted to be an Olympian since I was eight.&nbsp; So, putting my name out there to potentially lose my opportunity &#8212;</p>



<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Right.</p>



<p>MS. SCURRY:&nbsp; &#8212; was very, very difficult but very, very powerful, and we knew we had to do it.&nbsp; And I think when I saw that they filed that lawsuit, I thought it was so brave &#8212; so incredibly brave.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s the &#8212; it was the next evolution of the battle to be able to get U.S. soccer to take us more seriously.&nbsp;</p>



<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; What was the risk that they took when they filed that lawsuit &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. SCURRY:&nbsp; I mean &#8212;</p>



<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; &#8212; knowing it hadn&#8217;t been done before?&nbsp; Right?</p>



<p>MS. SCURRY:&nbsp; Yeah, I mean &#8212;</p>



<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; What was the risk?</p>



<p>MS. SCURRY:&nbsp; So &#8212; so when you file a lawsuit, in my opinion, you have your name on the dotted line of a legal document.&nbsp;</p>



<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Right.</p>



<p>MS. SCURRY:&nbsp; And so there&#8217;s that pressure and that connotation going along with that.&nbsp; And then to still have to try and win stuff, to go out there and play hard all the time that, I mean &#8212;</p>



<p>PARTICIPANT&nbsp; Win stuff.</p>



<p>MS. SCURRY:&nbsp; To win stuff.</p>



<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Right.&nbsp; Gold medals.&nbsp; Things like that.&nbsp; Right.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. SCURRY:&nbsp; To win a World Cup, to win Gold medals &#8212; that&#8217;s the expectation, even though you have this high level of time and energy, as everybody can attest to, pouring into something else.&nbsp; It almost, like, diverts from the goal, which should only be to win, not to do all these other things.</p>



<p>And so, I think having your name on a legal document &#8212; there&#8217;s all this extra effort in, you know, paying for lawyers and getting prepared and having maybe a potential trial or whatever it is.&nbsp; All that extra effort, I think, is the thing that&#8217;s so different with the lawsuit versus maybe other ways to do it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; I think that&#8217;s such an excellent point.&nbsp; As a general matter, when women are fighting for pay equity in any industry or in any employment setting, to require that the way that she will actually achieve parity in pay based on the value of work; to require that that &#8212; that that would take a lawsuit, the intervention of a court, the rule of law, means that she&#8217;s got to do her job every day, whatever that job is in whatever that industry is, and deal with the lawsuit.</p>



<p>MS. SCURRY:&nbsp; Yep.&nbsp; Absolutely.</p>



<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; And all that requires, in terms of the time spent but, to your point, the vulnerability to put your name on a legal document and then put yourself in a court setting that is adversarial in nature, all because you want to get paid &#8212; equal pay for equal work.</p>



<p>MS. SCURRY:&nbsp; Right.&nbsp; Right.</p>



<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; And what that requires of that woman beyond doing a good job, to your point, I think that&#8217;s such a &#8212; it&#8217;s a subtle but incredibly important point.</p>



<p>MS. SCURRY:&nbsp; Absolutely.</p>



<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; You were still striving for and achieving excellence in your job.&nbsp; And then it required superhuman excellence to endure litigation &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. SCURRY:&nbsp; Right.</p>



<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; &#8212; to just get paid for the value of your work.</p>



<p>Talk to me about the next generation and what that &#8212; what it &#8212; let&#8217;s talk about that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We &#8212; we were talking &#8212; we were talking backstage about how &#8212; I shared &#8212; my mother had many sayings.&nbsp; One of them she would say to me, “Kamala, you may be the first to do many things, but make sure you&#8217;re not the last.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>And what I love about the conversation that we were having &#8212; and I&#8217;m going to bring Megan and Alex into this conversation.&nbsp; But I love how you all really do think about this in terms of the generational impact &#8212; those who kind of had to go with the machete and go and try and knock things down to achieve fairness, and then the next generation that has come through really appreciating that and then carrying it through and continuing with that work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So why don&#8217;t we talk a little bit about that?</p>



<p>MS. PURCE:&nbsp; A hundred percent.&nbsp; When you used the analogy of the machete, I was just thinking: I think that&#8217;s so accurate.&nbsp; You guys had the machete, you have a sword, and now I feel like I have these like scissors &#8212; (laughter) &#8212; that I&#8217;m like, “All right, let&#8217;s &#8211;”&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. O’HARA:&nbsp; They’re sharp.&nbsp; They’re sharp.</p>



<p>MS. PURCE:&nbsp; Yeah, let&#8217;s &#8212; they&#8217;re sharp, but like let&#8217;s try them &#8212; like, let&#8217;s get it done.</p>



<p>I really do think that the true power of this team doesn&#8217;t come from the fact that we&#8217;re able to accomplish change, but we&#8217;re able to embolden others to pursue change.</p>



<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>MS. PURCE:&nbsp; It&#8217;s so evident that this progress is the result of women across generations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>MS. PURCE:&nbsp; And I think that&#8217;s a lesson in possibility.&nbsp; It shows that when you pursue what is right, others will join you and it will continue on pass whatever you &#8212; you can imagine it&#8217;s going to do.</p>



<p>So yeah, I mean, I even think &#8212; you know, I&#8217;m not the youngest player in camp.&nbsp; And even when I look younger than me, I&#8217;m like, “Yeah, they&#8217;re going to be great,” on both sides of the coin &#8212; on the field and off the field.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So I do agree the future is bright.&nbsp; And I &#8212; I&#8217;m really grateful to have had examples like this &#8212; you know, not just seeing it on television, but then practicing with it every day, being able to call it &#8212; I&#8217;m talking to Pinoe &#8212; after camp and see what&#8217;s going on.&nbsp; It&#8217;s &#8212; it&#8217;s incredible the &#8212; the culture that you guys have created, and I&#8217;m just so grateful to be a part of it.</p>



<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; And I love that point.&nbsp; It is &#8212; if we see it for what we should, which is that it&#8217;s &#8212; it&#8217;s really a fight for something, not against something, and, yes, about equal pay and equity, but also possibility &#8212; right? &#8212; and encouraging people to see what is possible, even if it has never been.</p>



<p>Megan, coming to you.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Coming to you.</p>



<p>Talk a little bit about where you think that there are lessons for women in other industries and professions, based on the experience that you all have had.&nbsp; What worked?&nbsp; What didn’t work?&nbsp; What’s the &#8212; how can you advise others about where maybe there are some hard knocks but where it was worth it because you saw some success?</p>



<p>MS. RAPINOE:&nbsp; (Inaudible.) (Audio on mute.)</p>



<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Oh.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. RAPINOE:&nbsp; Oh, I’m so mad.&nbsp; I’m so upset right now.</p>



<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; It&#8217;s the theme of the last two years.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. RAPINOE:&nbsp; I mean &#8212;</p>



<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Take two.&nbsp; Take two.</p>



<p>MS. RAPINOE:&nbsp; That just really &#8212; okay, I deserved that.&nbsp; (Laughter.)</p>



<p>I was going to say I’m not going to pass up this opportunity &#8212; certainly, for the first time in my life and the first time ever, hopefully not the last &#8212; to just say, &#8220;Madam Vice President.&#8221;&nbsp; Like, that’s &#8212; that’s incredible.&nbsp; And although it doesn’t have to do specifically with equal pay, I think it speaks to a changing landscape that we’re all part of.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I think the thing that I’ve &#8212; you know, it’s really settled with me &#8212; is that our freedom and our liberation and our equality is tied up in each other in the moment, but also generationally.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I mean, you’re seeing on the stage right now &#8212; you know, Madam Vice President, your mom, her famous quote about not being the last one, even though you&#8217;re the first &#8212; when we think of Billie Jean King; and Venus and Serena Williams; and WNBA players &#8212; obviously, my partner, Sue Bird, and Nneka Ogwumike.&nbsp; Like, all of these women are doing the same thing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And then, even go wider.&nbsp; If I&#8217;m seeing myself in, you know, union workers in Alabama and they&#8217;re seeing themselves in us or our team, it&#8217;s all kind of the same thing because we&#8217;re all dealing with the same issues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, I think for us, the more we connect our stories, the more we literally connect with each other, the more that we can kind of draft off each other, I think the more successful that we&#8217;ll be.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I know, for us &#8212; you know, our lawsuit &#8212; it doesn&#8217;t capture every single player and it doesn&#8217;t capture every single woman in all of America, but it is something and it&#8217;s our little part.</p>



<p>And I think when you start to string together the idea that all of our equality &#8212; I mean, frankly, across the entire spectrum of equality &#8212; but all of our liberation, all of our freedom, all of our worth is tied up in each other, now we have a movement.&nbsp; Now we have 50 percent of the country all fighting for the same thing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And then, of course, you add, you know, allies and advocates and people who believe and feel the same thing.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s where I think the biggest impact can come.&nbsp; Because, as you said, the little knocks &#8212; I mean, everything is a knock.&nbsp; Like, inequality is in the air that we breathe.&nbsp; And so, it is difficult at times.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And Kelley spoke to it.&nbsp; Being able to sign your name with 27 other people and being able to, at times, take a rest when you&#8217;re exhausted knowing that, you know, other women or other players or other people in your union are having your back and doing that work, I think, is essential, because it is difficult work and it is long work and the game has to be long.</p>



<p>So, I think, for all of us, you know, we sort of know it on the team just intrinsically because we know that we come from a long line of fighters and, you know, women who fought for equality and fought for freedoms for us and fought to make things better each generation.&nbsp; I think that&#8217;s our goal, and now really trying to tie it to a larger sort of society movement is what I think will have the most impact over the shortest amount of time.</p>



<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Well, that&#8217;s great.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s right.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s about the coalition and &#8212; and I think the strength of coalition always is seeing the commonalities and then &#8212; and then building and growing off of that in a way that empowers everybody.&nbsp; I think that&#8217;s right.</p>



<p>Alex, did you just get off the field?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. MORGAN:&nbsp; I’m very underdressed.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; I literally ran in and my cleats are still on.&nbsp; So, yes.</p>



<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; I know that, and I&#8217;m so glad that &#8212; because we were &#8212; we weren&#8217;t &#8212; we weren&#8217;t sure.&nbsp; And you hustled to get here, and I&#8217;m so glad.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I&#8217;m thinking, given the circumstances in which you are here, that it might be best to ask you: What are the analogies between the fight for equal pay and the fight to win a game?</p>



<p>MS. MORGAN:&nbsp; Oh.&nbsp; (Laughter.)</p>



<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Like, what does it take?&nbsp; What does it take?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. MORGAN:&nbsp; I mean &#8212;</p>



<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Give me some analogies.&nbsp; Like, right?&nbsp; The rules of winning a game.</p>



<p>MS. MORGAN:&nbsp; What does it take?&nbsp; I mean, it takes everything.&nbsp; It &#8212; honestly, I feel it&#8217;s everything.&nbsp; Like Pinoe said, sometimes you have some women stepping up and some have to take a backseat because they’re exhausted.&nbsp; So, it’s everyone fighting for each other.&nbsp; It’s working as a team.&nbsp; It’s supporting each other.&nbsp; It’s raising questions and knowing in your heart that you’re doing the right thing.&nbsp; And it’s leaning on each other.</p>



<p>A fight for equal pay is a lot longer than a soccer game and a lot harder.&nbsp; But there is &#8212; there’s definitely some similarities to be had.</p>



<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; And good coaches, I imagine, help.&nbsp; Right?</p>



<p>MS. MORGAN:&nbsp; Definitely.&nbsp; Coaches, lawyers, publicists &#8212;</p>



<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Fair umpires.&nbsp; (Laughs.)</p>



<p>MS. MORGAN:&nbsp; Yes.</p>



<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Referees.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. MORGAN:&nbsp; Yes.</p>



<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; All of that.&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>MS. MORGAN:&nbsp; Oh, it all &#8212; yeah, it all plays into it.&nbsp; Referees, judges, court decisions.&nbsp; Yep, it all plays into it.</p>



<p>MS. RAPINOE:&nbsp; That was good off the fly.</p>



<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; That was good off the fly, right?&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; I knew there would be some &#8212; I mean, it’s &#8212; because also it really is about pacing yourself, for sure, and figuring out how do you define the win.&nbsp; Right?&nbsp; And the score is certainly one.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But I think that on this point and to Megan’s point, anything that is about a fight for equality, the win includes that you fought.&nbsp; That’s part of defining the win &#8212; that you stood up for yourself.&nbsp; Right?&nbsp; Even in &#8212; when the odds were against you.&nbsp; Maybe it wasn’t popular.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You know, because in these kinds of processes &#8212; we were talking about the fact that I was in Selma last week, celebrating &#8212; or commemorating the 57th anniversary of the crossing of the Edmund Pettus Bridge, when those marchers &#8212; you know, they tried three times to cross that bridge and were beaten back, you know, shed blood on that bridge.&nbsp; But they didn&#8217;t give up.&nbsp; And every time they went, they were inspiring other people to know what was possible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And that&#8217;s &#8212; you know, it&#8217;s a similar thing to have that kind of faith in yourself and your cause and to not give up.&nbsp; And you all have done that in a really extraordinary way &#8212; a really extraordinary way.</p>



<p>So, thank you all very much.&nbsp; It&#8217;s really &#8212; it&#8217;s wonderful to watch.&nbsp; And I know many of us watched it from afar, saw the images of, you know, the difference in terms of locker rooms and &#8212; and the equipment, in terms of &#8212; yeah.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s good to know that things are changing for the better.</p>



<p>So, thank you all very much.&nbsp; For all &#8212; all of us who are here and all of us who are watching and the folks you probably never meet who are going to benefit from the work that you all did: Thank you.&nbsp; Thank you, guys.&nbsp;</p>



<p>PARTICIPANTS:&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Yay!&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; END&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3:57 P.M. EDT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">The White House</p>



<p>Looking around this room, at so many women who have blazed trails and shattered glass ceilings, I’m so grateful that you’ve joined us. <br> <br>Yet I can’t help but think of a woman whose name isn’t in our history books: my mother.  <br> <br>She was a stay-at-home mom of five girls in a suburb of Philadelphia. She spent her days trying to complete a to-do list that was never quite done.<br> <br>She was a terrible cook—we ate frozen fish sticks and boiled hotdogs—but she dressed the dinner table with fresh flowers and china each night to make it feel special.<br> <br>She was witty, and quick to laugh, and kind and she knew exactly what to say when my world was falling apart.<br> <br>That’s what I miss the most—how I could call her when I was hurt or angry, when I felt like I’d never live up to the person I wanted to be—and just the sound of her voice let me know that everything would be OK.                    <br> <br>She never asked me to follow in her footsteps—only made sure I knew I could find my own way and she’d be there to root for me.<br> <br>And though she left before I was done needing her, I feel her strength inside me. I see her fire in my daughter, Ashley. I know that she never stopped cheering me on.<br> <br>We are all here today because someone believed in us. Our mothers. Our nanas, and teachers, and mentors. Because someone taught us to be brave.<br> <br>And we are here to be those women for someone else. In big, historic ways—becoming, as the Vice President says, those “firsts, but not lasts”—and in small ways, too.<br> <br>Helping our daughters believe in a world we haven’t won yet, showing our sons that it’s their work too.<br> <br>Taking risks—even when we might fail—because we know that there is a young girl who needs to see us try.   <br> <br>Today, we honor the women who made us and the women we make.<br> <br>We know that there is still far to travel, but we keep moving, guided by the strong hands of the women who came before us, continuing the path they forged with sweat and pain and love.<br> <br>So thank you for being here. Thank you for celebrating this moment with us.<br> <br>May you never forget the women who are cheering you on. And may your voice be that ovation for the girls who come next. <br> <br>Thank you.</p>

<p>6:01 P.M. EDT<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Well, hello, everyone.&nbsp; Welcome to the White House.&nbsp; This is the biggest crowd we’ve had since we got here.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>I’m Joe Biden.&nbsp; I’m Jill Biden’s husband.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; And proud of it.&nbsp;<br><br>Welcome to Women’s History Month celebration.&nbsp; We’re honored to have what may well be the most inspiring event we’ve had at the White House so far.<br><br>I’ve often said that America’s strength is not just the example of our power, but the power of our example.&nbsp; And I mean that.&nbsp; Look at &#8212; I was going to say: Look at this stage, but that’s enough too.&nbsp; Look at this stage.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; But there’s been a little change in the arrangement of who’s on the stage because of the First Lady’s husband contracting COVID.&nbsp;<br><br>But look at this room and what you see.<br><br>THE FIRST LADY:&nbsp; (Inaudible.)<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Pardon?<br><br>THE FIRST LADY:&nbsp; You said the First &#8212; anyways.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Laughter.)<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; That’s right.&nbsp; She’s fine.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; It’s me that’s not together.<br><br>The Second La- &#8212; the First Gentleman.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; How about that.<br><br>Anyway, an incredible group of members of Congress, led by Nancy Pelosi, the first woman Speaker &#8212; (applause) &#8212; who I believe will be considered one of the greatest Speakers in our history.&nbsp; And I mean that.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br><br>And she knows I mean it.&nbsp; I’ve been saying it for years.&nbsp;<br><br>And members of the most diverse Cabinet in the history of this country.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; And the first to have an equal number of women and men in the Cabinet.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br><br>I’m enormously proud of this team.&nbsp; One person I’m particularly proud of is &#8212; was going to be introducing me &#8212; is Kamala Harris.&nbsp; But Kamala &#8212; (applause) &#8212; as I said, Kamala chose not to take a chance since her husband had contracted COVID, although he’s feeling very well, I’m told.<br><br>And, by the way, when he tested &#8212; he’s fine, but out of an abundance of caution, she decided she wasn’t going to join us today.&nbsp; But let’s send her our love because she’s something else.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>And I know how proud she is of our &#8212; our team:<br><br>Avril Haines &#8212; the first woman to lead our intelligence community as Director of National Intelligence.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Stand up, Avril.&nbsp; Come on.&nbsp; Stand up.&nbsp; She does everything in secret.&nbsp; That’s why she doesn’t want to stand up.&nbsp;<br><br>Former governor Jennifer Granholm, the Energy Department.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; I often kid her &#8212; and I wasn’t kidding early on when I seeking the nomination.&nbsp; Had she been born in America, she’d be standing here and I’d be sitting there.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; She’s the former governor of the state of Michigan.&nbsp; Michigan.&nbsp; Wrong.&nbsp; She was a former sta- &#8212; she was a governor.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; No, I’m teasing.&nbsp; But we often kidded about it.<br><br>And Isabel Guzman, the Small Business Administration.&nbsp; Where are you?&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Katherine Tai, U.S. Trade Representative.&nbsp; And she knows how to cut a deal.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>MS. CONE:&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you.&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.&nbsp;&nbsp;And that’s (inaudible).</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp;&nbsp;All right. &nbsp;Thank you.&nbsp;&nbsp;(Applause.)<br><br>And, look, we&#8217;re doing so by expanding access to good-paying jobs, lower costs for childcare and eldercare so women can get back to work and their families can have economic security.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And earlier today, I signed an executive order to promote efforts to achieve pay equality and pay equity for employees of federal contractors.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s my hope that this sets an example for all private companies to follow as well.&nbsp; That&#8217;s the purpose of what I did.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>Let me just close with this: Gender equality is not a woman&#8217;s issue alone; it benefits everybody.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s a fact.&nbsp; It benefits everyone &#8212; our society, our economy, and our country.</p>



<p>And I hope you&#8217;re able to walk through the wonderful exhibit we have downstairs celebrating Women&#8217;s History Month and the history of the journey of America.</p>



<p>Back in Fer- &#8212; back in February, I was in Lorain, Ohio, outside of Cleveland, to talk about a new infrastructure law that was going to transform our nation.&nbsp; It was the day before the birthday of Lorain&#8217;s most famous &#8212; one of her most famous daughters, Nobel Prize, Pulitzer Prize, No- &#8212; Nobel Prize winner, Pulitzer Prize winner, and one of Jill&#8217;s favorite authors, Toni Morrison.&nbsp; Toni is also &#8212; was also the mother-in-law of Dr. Rouse, one of our nation&#8217;s top economic thinkers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ms. Morrison left us words to live by.&nbsp; She said, “We&#8217;ve got more yesterdays than anybody.&nbsp; We need some kind of tomorrow.”&nbsp; “We need some kind of tomorrow.”</p>



<p>Downstairs is a display honoring Toni Morrison and that singular belief in tomorrow &#8212; that singular belief that America &#8212; in America, anything is possible.</p>



<p>I was once asked by Xi Jinping in China how &#8212; could I define America.  I said, “Yes.  In one word.”  God’s truth &#8212; one word: “Possibilities.”  We believe anything is possible in this country. <br><br>And that singular power of example shows our daughters, our granddaughters there’s not a single thing a man can do that a woman can’t do as well or better.<br><br>And, by the way, I can honestly say without fear of contradiction: From the time my daughter was born &#8212; our daughter was born &#8212; so, the time our four granddaughters were born &#8212; I&#8217;ve told them every day they could listen that there&#8217;s not a single thing they can&#8217;t do.  And I mean that from the bottom of my heart.  And they are living proof of that truth.<br><br>I want to start talking about my granddaughters now, if I can.  But &#8212; (laughter).<br><br>You know, especially the women I&#8217;m honored to introduce and who has more influence on them and has set an example that I think I&#8217;m just fortunate and they&#8217;re fortunate to have witnessed and be part of.<br><br>And with that, let me introduce the First Lady of the United States.  Before she comes up, I want you to know: Everybody knows I love her more than she loves me.  (Laughter.) I&#8217;m going to tell the story, Jill. <br><br>THE FIRST LADY:  No.  (Laughter.)<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:  I&#8217;m going to tell the story. <br><br>When we first got to the Vice President&#8217;s office, as those of you who are from Washington know, you walk down the steps of the Eisenhower Building, and you&#8217;re looking right into the Vice President&#8217;s office.  And the windows, I think, are 16 feet high and they have 12 big panes of glass, and four of them going across the office.  I think it&#8217;s four. <br><br>And &#8212; and so, Jill&#8217;s favorite day is &#8212; of the year is Valentine&#8217;s Day.  And so, she had gotten, as a professor &#8212; a teacher &#8212; she&#8217;s still teaching full-time &#8212; a teacher, she got that erasable paint you can, you know, use.  And she, on every window &#8212; every window &#8212; she got the maintenance guy to bring up a ladder.  And on every window, she put a big heart, and she said, “Joe loves Jill.”  (Laughter.)  Swear to God.  In every single window.  (Laughter.) <br><br>Well, my press person came to me &#8212; because she did it in the evening, and &#8212; and she &#8212; the night before Valentine&#8217;s Day.  And he said, “Look, they want you to go on CBS tomorrow morning and talk about Valentine&#8217;s Day.  We think you should do it.”  Now, her name &#8212; the interviewer is Juju Chang.  And Juju &#8212; we’re sitting there in the Vice President&#8217;s large office with all the shades pulled, in the dark, and just the lights on &#8212; you know, the Klieg lights.  And we&#8217;re about knee to knee.  And while we&#8217;re getting ready, Juju Chang looks at me and says, “You know, everybody says you and your wife have a great love affair going.”  I said, “I think so.”  I said, “But everybody knows I love her more than she loves me.”  And she looked at me straight in the eye &#8212; give you my word &#8212; and said, “That’s what they say.”  (Laughter.) <br><br>Ladies and gentlemen, the love of my life and the life of my love: Jill.  (Applause.)</p>

<p>1:10 P.M. EDT<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Hi, everyone.&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; I&#8217;m making up for my lack of toppers over the last couple of days today, but hopefully some of this information will be helpful to all of you.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>First, as you may have seen and many of you reported, today we&#8217;ve outlined the severe and immediate consequences that the United States will face if Congress fails to provide us with $22.5 billion in emergency funding to fight COVID-19.&nbsp; Those consequences are dire: fewer monoclonal antibodies sent to states, an inability to purchase additional treatments, fewer tests available to Americans, less surveillance for future variants, and a risk of running short on vaccines.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>For months, we have been engaging Congress about our needs for additional COVID response funds.&nbsp; Just to give you a few examples: In January, we notified Congress that responding to the unprecedented surge in cases due to Omicron would exhaust our funds.&nbsp; Throughout February, we held briefings about the lack of funding and what the consequences would be if we didn&#8217;t get additional funds.&nbsp; In the President&#8217;s State of the Union Address, the President called for additional COVID funding.&nbsp; And our National Preparedness Plan made clear that funding is needed.&nbsp;<br><br>In total, senior administration officials have held more than three dozen calls and meetings with Congress and at least 10 briefings to committees to communicate our needs so that we can do what Americans can ex- &#8212; should expect from their government: protecting them from a once-in-a-generation pandemic.&nbsp;<br><br>I&#8217;ll finally say on this: With cases rising abroad, scientific and medical experts have been clear that in the next couple of months, there could be increasing cases of COVID-19 here in the United States as well.&nbsp; We talked about this a bit yesterday.<br><br>Waiting to provide funding until we&#8217;re in a worse spot with the virus will be too late.&nbsp; We need funding now so we&#8217;re prepared for whatever comes.&nbsp;<br><br>Also, some news some of you have been asking about.&nbsp; The President will travel to Brussels, Belgium, later this month, where he will join an extraordinary NATO summit on March 24th to discuss ongoing deterrence and defense efforts in response to Russia&#8217;s unprovoked and unjustified attack on Ukraine, as well as to reaffirm our ironclad commitment to our NATO Allies.&nbsp;<br><br>He will also join a scheduled European Council summit to discuss our shared concerns about Ukraine, including transatlantic efforts to impose economic costs on Russia, provide humanitarian support to those affected by the violence, and address other challenges related to the conflict.&nbsp;<br><br>I also wanted to note, because there has been so much information we&#8217;ve been putting out and so many sanctions putting into &#8212; we&#8217;ve put into place, some of the economic impacts that we&#8217;re seeing in Russia, just to give you all an update on that.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>We&#8217;ve made President Putin&#8217;s war of choice a strategic failure.&nbsp; The unprecedented costs we&#8217;ve imposed with Allies and partners have reversed 30 years of economic progress &#8212; something President Putin himself pushed for &#8212; and that has happened in less than a month.&nbsp;<br><br>Our actions have hit hard at the things President Putin cares about the most, degrading his military, access to cutting-edge technology, an ability to project power and influence.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Central Bank reserves &#8212; about half of Putin&#8217;s war chest &#8212; is immobilized.&nbsp; You heard the finance minister confirm this just yesterday or the day before.&nbsp; He can&#8217;t use these rainy-day funds to support his war in Ukraine.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>The ruble is less than a penny.&nbsp; It&#8217;s the worst-performing emerging market currency.&nbsp; The Russian stock market has been closed for nearly three weeks, longest in his- &#8212; in its history, as they try to prevent a market crash.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Inflation in Russia is rampant.&nbsp; Some forecasters are predicting 20 percent inflation for Russia by the end of the year.&nbsp; And the Russian &#8212; and trillions of dollars in businesses have been disrupted by sanctions, putting the Russian financial sector under severe stress.<br><br>The economic outlook &#8212; if you look at the economic outlook for the country, forecasters around the world are projecting a collapse of the Russian economy.&nbsp; The Institute for International Finance projects a 15 percent downturn, down from a projected growth rate of 3 percent before Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine.<br><br>And the private sector, as many of you have reported on, is withdrawing many companies &#8212; major companies.&nbsp; And the financial, energy, and other sectors are leaving.&nbsp; J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Western Union, ExxonMobil, Shell, and more are pulling their operations out of the country.&nbsp;<br><br>And as we continue to ratchet up pressure on Putin&#8217;s oligarchs, I wanted to also announce for you &#8212; or reiterate for you, for those of you who already know, that tomorrow, Secretary of Treasury Janet Yellen and Attorney General Garland will host the launch meeting of the Russian elites, proxies, and oligarchs multi- &#8212; multilateral task force.<br><br>The task force was first announced in a statement by leaders, including President Biden, on February 26th, as a way to go after corrupt gains from some of the individuals closest to Putin no matter what, where they&#8217;re held around the world.<br><br>And the task force, comprised of Finance Minis- &#8212; Ministry and Justice or Home Ministry counterparts in Germany, Canada, Japan, France, Italy, Australia, the European Commission, and the United Kingdom will use the respective authorities to collect and share information against Russian targets, including sanctions, asset freezing, and civil and criminal asset seizure.<br><br>Let me give you just a couple of examples of assets that have already been seized:<br><br>Alexei Mordashov’s 213-foot yacht was impounded in Italy.&nbsp; Gennady Timchenko’s 132-foot yacht was seized in Italy.&nbsp; Andrey Mel- &#8212; Melnichenko’s 469-foot, $578 million superyacht was seized in Italy.&nbsp; Sergei Chemezov’s $140 million yacht was seized in Spain.&nbsp; Igor Sechin’s 280-foot yacht was impounded in France.&nbsp; And Alisher Usmanov’s $18 million resort was impounded in Sardinia.&nbsp; That is just the beginning.<br><br>Last thing I just wanted to note &#8212; sorry, I have two quick things for you, then we&#8217;ll get to the questions &#8212; is: On Ukrainian security assistance, the President will talk about this when he speaks this afternoon, and he will talk about it more extensively tomorrow.<br><br>As you know, there is $13.6 billion for Ukraine &#8212; humanitarian, security, and economic assistance &#8212; in the omnibus bill that the President is going to sign this afternoon.&nbsp; He will outline in more detail, I expect tomorrow the specifics, but he will of course talk about it when he signs it this afternoon.<br><br>But just to &#8212; even up to date now, since taking office, the President has committed $1.2 billion in security assistance to Ukraine, including $550 million in just the last two weeks.<br><br>We have approved &#8212; he has approved four emergency security assistance packages to provide Ukraine the types of weapons they are using so effectively to defend their country, such as anti-armor and air defense weapons.<br><br>We are working to get Ukraine the equipment as quickly as possible.&nbsp; And we are &#8212; still have the means to continue doing that.<br><br>Over the past two weeks alone, we have delivered more than $300 million of security assistance to Ukraine, in addition to the transfers of U.S.-made equipment we are facilitating from our Allies to Ukraine as well.<br><br>So, I would note that &#8212; we&#8217;re on day 19 here.&nbsp; In addition to their incredible courage and bravery, one of the reasons that they are able to hold back and push back against the Russian military is because of the significant amount of military assistance we have provided.<br><br>Finally, I just wanted to &#8212; I wanted to note that today is Equal Pay Day, something we can all celebrate.&nbsp; President Biden and Vice President Harris have long championed equal pay as a cornerstone of their commitment to ensure all people have a fair and equal opportunity to get ahead.<br><br>To mark Equal Pay Day, today the Biden-Harris administration announced a couple of new actions to promote women’s empowerment and support women&#8217;s family &#8212; women &#8212; working families across the country.&nbsp;<br><br>The Office of Personnel Management announced that they will anticipate issuing a proposed regulation that will address the use of prior salary history in the hiring and pay-setting process for federal employees.<br><br>The President will sign an executive order directing the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council to consider limiting the use of salary information in employment decisions by federal contractors.&nbsp; And the Department of Labor released a report analyzing the impact of occupational segregation on women’s economic security.<br><br>And the Vice President will host an event later today, along with the Gender Policy Council.<br><br>I also just wanted to note the news that we heard from the CEO of Fox this morning that cameraman Pierre Zakrzewski &#8212; I just want to pronounce his name the right way &#8212; did I pronounce it the right way? &#8212; okay &#8212; lost his life.<br><br>He is someone who has served in many warzones over the course of time.&nbsp; He was a warzone photographer who covered nearly every international story for Fox News &#8212; from Iraq, to Afghanistan, to Syria &#8212; during his long tenure working there.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>So, we just &#8212; our thoughts, our prayers are with his family, with the entire community as well.&nbsp;<br><br>So, let me stop there.&nbsp; And let&#8217;s kick it off, Chris.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; So, President Zelenskyy is going to be speaking to Congress tomorrow.&nbsp; He&#8217;s been pushing for fighter jets, a no-fly zone.&nbsp; You’ll have to hear some of those same requests tomorrow, as well.&nbsp; Has the administration&#8217;s shift- &#8212; thinking shifted on that at all?&nbsp;<br><br>And also, there is rising domestic pressure for the U.S. to do more.&nbsp; How does the President plan to continue being, like, a voice of restraint in these situations and holding back some of those requests?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, first, I don&#8217;t think the President views himself as a voice of restraint.&nbsp; We have provided and he has approved and expedited the delivery of more assistance &#8212; military and security assistance &#8212; to Ukraine than any year in history.&nbsp;<br><br>And I did a bit of an outline for you at the beginning: $1.2 billion in assistance that &#8212; including $300 million that we&#8217;ve been able to get to Ukrainian fighters, helping them to hold back the Russian military over the past few weeks.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>It is also true &#8212; and there will be more that the President will be able to say over the next few days, given he is about to sign a 13.6 &#8212; an omnibus bill that includes $13.6 billion in security assistance.&nbsp; So, I expect he will share more of those details in the next 24 hours.&nbsp;<br><br>It is also true that the President has to look at decisions that are made through the prism of what is in our national security interests and global security interests.&nbsp; And he continues to believe that a no-fly zone would be escalatory, could prompt a war with Russia.&nbsp;<br><br>I don&#8217;t believe there&#8217;s a lot of advocates calling for that at this point in time from Capitol Hill, but we certainly understand and recognize that is still a call from President Zelenskyy.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And on COVID, given your push for more &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; funding there, is this a sign the administration is worried that the U.S. could see a rise in numbers like we&#8217;ve seen in Europe?&nbsp; And is the administration considering advising Americans to get another booster shot?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, any decision or recommendation about a booster shot would be made by the CDC.&nbsp; But as we&#8217;ve said from the beginning, we always want to be prepared for any scenario that may come up.&nbsp; Right?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>And we have also said that, while we have made an enormous amount of progress in vaccinating Americans, in getting Americans boosted, in providing free masks and free tests to people across the country, that we are still continuing to fight the pandemic.&nbsp; And if we wait too long, we are not going to be able to continue a lot of the programs that are so effective.&nbsp;<br><br>And just to give you some more specifics: We are going to run out of our supply of monoclonal antibodies by June.&nbsp; We’ll be unable to maintain our testing capacity beyond June.&nbsp; We can&#8217;t purchase additional courses of Evusheld, and our existing supply will likely run out &#8212; this is for &#8212; this as a treatment for the immunocompromised &#8212; by the end of 2022.&nbsp;<br><br>The fund that reimburses doctors and other medical providers for caring for uninsured individuals will be scaled back this month and end in early April.&nbsp;<br><br>So those are just some of the examples of where the American people could be deeply impacted if we don&#8217;t get funding from Congress.&nbsp; There is not a secret plan.&nbsp; There is not another option.&nbsp; We need money in order to continue to supply these programs.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And one last thing.&nbsp; Sorry, just back on the Ukraine<br>thing.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You said, obviously, a no-fly zone is viewed as escalatory.&nbsp; But I noticed you did not say anything about the fighter jet requests.&nbsp; Is that something that the administration would reconsider?&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Nothing has changed about the analysis that the Department of Defense provided last week, where they assessed that, because of the challenges in delivery and the challenges &#8212; and the impact that providing these would have &#8212; would be greater risk than there would be benefit.&nbsp;<br><br>And I would note that the way that the President and the Department of Defense and our experts here have been responding to this conflict is by providing the type of military and assistance &#8212; assistance and equipment that has &#8212; the Ukrainians have used to push back and to fight and effectively do that over the last 19 days.&nbsp; And that is what we will continue to provide with the additional funding in the omnibus.&nbsp;<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One, I guess, housekeeping matter on the remarks tomorrow from Zelenskyy: Does the President plan to watch?&nbsp; And will he have a response to his address?&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I&#8217;m sure that, to the degree that President can with his schedule, he’ll certainly be watching as we all will be.&nbsp; He gave a very powerful &#8212; President Zelenskyy gave a very powerful set of remarks today when he spoke in Canada &#8212; or to the Canadians, I should say &#8212; and we certainly expect that to be the case tomorrow.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And on the Ukrainian security assistance, there are concerns that Putin could possibly try to target or strike a delivery of American military supplies.&nbsp; How concerned are you about this?&nbsp; And how confident are you that this assistance will ultimately reach its intended destination?&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would say that, obviously, they&#8217;ve been in the middle of a war zone for the past few weeks.&nbsp; And we&#8217;ve still been able to deliver $300 million in security assistance just over the last two weeks.&nbsp; And we believe we will continue to have the means to do that.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And has the President been discussing with other NATO leaders how they would respond if Putin were to strike a delivery of American military supplies inside Poland?&nbsp;<br><br>And just so I&#8217;m clear about what would happen in this instance: Would a strike in Poland on supplies, or anything really, automatically be met with a military &#8212; a forceful response?&nbsp; There&#8217;s typically a conversation amongst Allies about how to respond.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, again, typically, there is a conversation before you do a coordinated response.&nbsp; Right?&nbsp; But I would say, without getting into a hypothetical, we have a range of conversations that happen through a lot of channels, including military and defense channels, including diplomatic channels as we prepare for a range of contingencies.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; American families are preparing for summer vacations right now, often require travel by car long distances.&nbsp; What kind of guidance does the White House have?&nbsp; I mean, should they expect or plan for $4 gasoline come summer?&nbsp; Is there like a &#8212; I know you guys are concerned about the price, but is there a sense of urgency to get something done before those summer months, which are really critical, for a number of reasons, for drivers?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; Look, I think the President and our national security team and our economic team are working overtime right now to evaluate and examine a range of domestic options that continue to be on the table, and also to engage with global suppliers about what can be done to ensure that the supply in the market meets the demand, thus bringing the price down.<br><br>So, it is &#8212; there is certainly urgency.&nbsp; There is certainly a need to do everything we can to ensure we&#8217;re mitigating the impact.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; A bipartisan group of lawmakers have called on the White House to lift the ban of summer sales of gasoline with higher blends of ethanol.&nbsp; It&#8217;s cheaper than traditional blends of gasoline.&nbsp; Is that something &#8212; you mentioned a menu of options, but is that something specifically that the White House is considering?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; In the menu of options.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any comment on Maryland moving towards a suspension of their state&#8217;s gasoline tax?&nbsp; Is that something you guys &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; There are a number of other states who have taken that step.&nbsp; Again, there&#8217;s a range of domestic options.&nbsp; I would note that, from the federal standpoint, the gasoline tax is about 18 cents, right?&nbsp; So we&#8217;re also looking at a range of options that might have different types of impacts.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You brought up the 18 cents.&nbsp; Is that because &#8212; I mean, it wouldn’t have much of an impact at 18 cents if you &#8212; given at &#8212; at $4.50.&nbsp; Is that a fair rate of how you guys assess that?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I&#8217;m not a mathematician, but, you know, given that the price of gas has gone up by 75 cents, $1, even more in some areas, we&#8217;re continuing to look at a range of options.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>And obviously, ensuring that there is &#8212; or taking steps to ensure there is more supply in the market, because the oil market is a global market, is a big priority and a focus for us.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>But we&#8217;re looking at a range of domestic options, including all the ones you mentioned, just no decision has been made at this point in time.<br><br>Go ahead, Kaitlan.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; You confirm President Biden is going to Brussels next week.&nbsp; He&#8217;s going to attend the NATO summit and the European Council meeting.&nbsp; Is he also going to go to Poland, as has been reported?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We don&#8217;t have anything more yet about his trip to announce.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But should we expect anything when it comes to the refugee crisis aspect of what&#8217;s been going on?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We&#8217;re still working through the final details of the trip and what it may look like, but I don&#8217;t have any more details at this point in time.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And what is his goal going into this trip?&nbsp; And is there any chance that he sees President Zelenskyy while he&#8217;s there?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; His goal is to meet in person, face to face with his European counterparts and talk about and assess where we are at this point in the conflict, in the invasion of Ukraine by Russia.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>We&#8217;ve been incredibly aligned to date; that doesn&#8217;t happen by accident.&nbsp; The President is a big believer in face-to-face diplomacy, so it&#8217;s an opportunity to do exactly that.&nbsp;<br><br>In terms of a meeting with President Zelenskyy or an engagement with President Zelenskyy, we&#8217;re still finalizing the trip at this point in time.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But that&#8217;s an option?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp;&nbsp; Nothing on the table at this point in time, but the real focus right now is to meet with NATO partners in Brussels.&nbsp; If there are additional steps, we&#8217;ll share all those details with all of you.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And on President Zelenskyy’s address tomorrow, of course, he is expected to ask for more assistance.&nbsp; As my colleague noted, a lot of the U.S. positions on that haven&#8217;t changed, as you just said, when it comes to the ni- &#8212; no-fly zone.&nbsp;<br><br>But on the aircraft specifically, the Pentagon said last week that Secretary Austin said they “do not support the transfer of additional fighter aircraft…at this time.”&nbsp; Is that still the United States’ position?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; That continues to be our position.&nbsp; I would note that they also said that the ai- &#8212; that adding aircraft to the Ukrainian inventory is not likely to significantly change the effectiveness of the Ukrainian Air Force relative to Russian capabilities.&nbsp;<br><br>And the assessment was that the transfer of these planes may be mistaken as escalatory, as we&#8217;ve said, and could result in a significant Russian reaction.&nbsp; But that is the risk assessment that was done.&nbsp; That risk assessment has not changed.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>I would note that certainly we expect, as he should, President Zelenskyy to ask for more money.&nbsp; We have &#8212; we are in touch with his team on a daily basis.&nbsp; We&#8217;re not waiting to &#8212; we&#8217;re not waiting to hear tomorrow what may be on his mind.&nbsp; We are very closely engaged with the Ukrainians.&nbsp;<br><br>And that &#8212; what is &#8212; what hopefully will be of interest to him is the significant amount of security assistance that is in the omnibus that we&#8217;ll be able to detail soon.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just to clarify, has he told the White House what he plans to ask for tomorrow?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; That&#8217;s not what I&#8217;m suggesting.&nbsp; But the President had a nearly hour-long call with him on Friday, and we talk with his team every day.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Go ahead, Ash.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You mentioned before that President Zelenskyy gave an extremely powerful set of remarks to Canada, and you expect something similar tomorrow to Congress.&nbsp; I was wondering if you could talk about how the administration plans to handle that sort of very emotional appeal where we expect him to be asking for certain things, which President Biden has already made clear he&#8217;s not willing to provide.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I think that, one, what is encouraging in this moment of tragedy is that there is bipartisan support for the strength and the courage of Ukrainian leadership and President Zelenskyy and the fight that they have been waging for the last 19 days.<br><br>I would say that without knowing what he&#8217;s going to say tomorrow, we certainly are familiar with what the asks have been.&nbsp; We have provided our own assessment of what does make sense and doesn&#8217;t make sense.&nbsp; And what I would note is that we do have a range of &#8212; the President and the &#8212; our team has fought for additional assistance in the omnibus package the President is signing this afternoon, which hopefully we&#8217;ll have more details on in the coming days.&nbsp;<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.&nbsp; To follow up on that: Zelenskyy and other Ukrainian officials have made so clear that what they believe they need the most is more war planes and fighter jets.&nbsp; So why is the U.S. assessing something different?&nbsp; Why does the U.S. believe they know better what Ukraine needs than what Ukrainian officials are saying they need the most?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, we have one of the best militaries in the world.&nbsp; I would note just some factual details here: The Ukrainian Air Force has several squadrons of fully mission-capable aircraft.&nbsp; And although Russian air capabilities are significant, their effectiveness has been limited due to the Ukrainian strategic, operational, and tactical ground-based air defense systems, which the United States has provided the vast majority of.&nbsp; So, what we&#8217;re talking about here is what is most effective in combating and fighting the type of war the Russians are fighting.<br><br>We&#8217;ve talked a little bit about the attack on &#8212; near the Polish border.&nbsp; That would not have been stopped by airplanes; that type of attack is stopped by exactly the type of assistance we&#8217;ve provided.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; So it&#8217;s a combination of impact as well as potential risks that the administration has decided “no” on the war planes?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Exactly.&nbsp; Exactly.&nbsp; And the fact that the air force has several squadrons of fully mission-capable aircraft.&nbsp; The $1.2 billion in military assistance that we&#8217;ve provided has provided exactly the type of capabilities that have helped them fight back and push back effectively and courageously against the inbound attacks from the Russian military.<br><br>And as you also noted, Weijia, the risk associated is also something that our U.S. military would assess as part of their analysis.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; And then to follow up on Mary&#8217;s question: How does the U.S. define a Russian incursion or invasion into NATO territory?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; That&#8217;s a conversation we have with our NATO partners and Allies.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, as an example, there are reports that a Russian drone made its way into Polish airspace before going back to Ukraine and being shot down.&nbsp; Does a drone into Poland count as an invasion into Russi- &#8212; NATO territory?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, again, Weijia, what happens here &#8212; it&#8217;s not that NATO countries just respond on their own.&nbsp; If there is an attack or an &#8212; that is considered by NATO leadership and by NATO countries to be &#8212; to meet that bar, then there&#8217;s a discussion among NATO partners about how to respond.<br><br>But it&#8217;s not in anyone&#8217;s interest to get into an escalatory war with Russia.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Got it.&nbsp; And one more on the sanctions that were imposed today by Russia against yourself, President Biden, and other top U.S. officials.&nbsp; Do you have a response to that?&nbsp; And how will it impact any of you, if at all?&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; I would first note that President Biden is a junior, so they may &#8212; may have sanctioned his dad.&nbsp; May he rest in peace.<br><br>The second piece, I would say, is that &#8212; it won&#8217;t surprise any of you that none of us are planning tourist trips to Russia and none of us have bank accounts that we won&#8217;t be able to access, so we will forge ahead.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; Following up on the drone question from Weijia: The Soviet-era drone that flew over three NATO member states on Friday and then crashed into Croatia, has it been determined whether that was a Russian drone or Ukrainian drone?&nbsp; And how do you measure &#8212; similar to what she was asking &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; how do you measure, you know, what elicits a response?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, the &#8212; for the second part of your question, Jacqui &#8212; good question &#8212; it is a conversation that happens between NATO Allies and partners, not &#8212; not a &#8212; not a decision that&#8217;s made by one country.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>In terms of the first part, I don&#8217;t have any details that I can outline for you from here.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then what do you make of China today warning that Taiwan belongs to China and saying that it will not stop normal trade relations with Russia?&nbsp; What qualifies as helping Russia evade sanctions when it comes to China?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, let me note that one of the &#8212; one of the &#8212; during the lengthy conversation that our National Security Advisor had with his counterpart, he also conveyed &#8212; reiterated our one-China policy, based on the Taiwan Relations Act, Three Communiqués, and Six Assurances, and underscored concerns about Beijing&#8217;s coercive and provocative actions across the Taiwan Strait, which is, of course, our position publicly.&nbsp; But it&#8217;s also something that he took the time to reiterate during this conversation.<br><br>There are a range of sanctions we obviously have in place.&nbsp; And we watch, of course, if there&#8217;s a violation of those, and we also watch if there is support provided for the military invasion of another country.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have any assessment of that to provide to you today.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And it sounds like secondary sanctions are on the table if China is found to be helping Russia, either militarily or economically, in this war.&nbsp; So, why not be specific about the kinds of sanctions that we&#8217;re considering, given that this administration&#8217;s position is the mere threat of sanctions should be a deterrent?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, we&#8217;re going to have those conversations directly with China and Chinese leadership and not through the media at this point in time.<br><br>I would note that when our National Security Advisor was having his meeting yesterday, he was very direct about the comp- &#8212; the consequences.&nbsp; He made clear we&#8217;re going to be watching closely, made clear that it&#8217;s not just us.&nbsp; The decisions that China makes are going to be watched by the world.<br><br>So, that is how they focused the meeting.&nbsp; But in terms of any potential impacts or consequences, we&#8217;ll leave those through private diplomatic channels at this point.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One last one on Zelenskyy tomorrow.&nbsp; It sounds like, you know, we&#8217;re pretty dug in on our position when it comes to the no-fly zone, when it comes to the MiGs, despite this growing call &#8212; bipartisan call on Congress to shift a little bit.&nbsp; To put it bluntly, is Zelenskyy wasting his time tomorrow asking for these things?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would say because of the passion and the courage and the bravery of President Zelenskyy, there has been support for expediting the delivery of a historic amount of military and security assistance and weapons that have helped him and his military fight back against the Russians.<br><br>And I would say that, yes, we recognize there are a range of bipartisan calls.&nbsp; But what we have the responsibility to do here is to assess what the impact is on the United States and our own national security.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>A no-fly zone is escalatory and could prompt a war with Russia, a major nuclear power.&nbsp; Providing the planes &#8212; our military did an assessment that&#8217;s based not just on the risk, but whether it would have a huge benefit to them.&nbsp; They assessed it would not because they have their own squadron of planes and because the type of military assistance that is working to fight this war effectively is the type of assistance we&#8217;re already providing.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So what about Estonia, though, calling for a no-fly zone?&nbsp; They’re a NATO member.&nbsp; They share a border with Russia.&nbsp; How do we view their calls for a no-fly zone?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We disagree with the argument that that would be an effective step.&nbsp; Because a no-fly zone, which often people shorthand, essentially means us shooting down Russian planes and them potentially shooting back at us.&nbsp;<br><br>And I would note that the way that the Ukrainians, again, have effectively pushed back over the last 19 days is by using exactly the type of military assistance we have provided.<br><br>Go ahead, Kristen.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.&nbsp; A couple of questions.&nbsp; Are there discussions about the President meeting with refugees on his trip to Europe?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; It&#8217;s a good question, and obviously we have provided &#8212; and he&#8217;ll talk about this, this afternoon &#8212; historic amounts of humanitarian assistance, a great deal of that focused on helping refugees.&nbsp; There&#8217;s going to be more in this package.&nbsp; But there&#8217;s &#8212; we don&#8217;t have additional details beyond what I just announced at the top of the briefing.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; And to follow up on Weijia’s question quickly &#8212; Russia sanctioning various top officials here.&nbsp; I understand you&#8217;re dismissing it; however, does the administration, does the President see that as an escalation of any kind?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Again, I think we are confident that if we need to have continued &#8212; and we will need to have direct and indirect conversations with Russia, we will have the ability to do that.&nbsp;<br><br>But it&#8217;s related to &#8212; and I don&#8217;t have anything official aside from the reports. &nbsp;I don&#8217;t know how their sanctioning process works; I only know how our sanctioning process works.&nbsp; But it relates to the impact typically on bank accounts or travel that&#8217;s not diplomatic.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to ask you, again, about the conversation about some of these MiGs.&nbsp; Former Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch has been quite outspoken recently, and she said, “We need to mitigate risk, but it&#8217;s also true that not taking greater action comes with a risk as well, because Putin is a bully, and he only understands strength.”&nbsp; Is the President showing enough strength against Putin?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; The President has rallied the global community to put in place a greater set of financial sanctions package than has ever been done for any economy in the world.&nbsp; It wouldn’t have happened &#8212;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And yet, it hasn&#8217;t stopped Putin at all.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; &#8212; without his action.<br><br>I just outlined for you at the top, which I think it&#8217;s important to note, the crippling impact this has had on the economy. &nbsp;<br><br>They are where they are at this point in time &#8212; I think we all have seen reports and we have confirmed many of them that they did not expect it to take this long.&nbsp; They did not expect their military to not make as much progress as they have made.&nbsp;<br><br>The steps we are taking are making it more difficult for President Putin to build and augment his military, to get access to the technology that he needs and wants.<br><br>It has taken steps to cripple the economy &#8212; that there&#8217;s no question, regardless of what Kremlin spokespeople say, it has had a dramatic impact on the economy.<br><br>And we&#8217;re doing all of that while providing a historic amount of military assistance to the Ukrainians, helping them effectively fight back.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Putin were to use chemical weapons, would it change the President&#8217;s thinking when it comes to these MiGs &#8212; taking the no-fly zone off the table &#8212; but at least on this issue?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I&#8217;m not going to get into a hypothetical.&nbsp; We &#8212; of course, there would be severe confli- &#8212; consequences from the global community, ones that we would discuss with our partners and allies.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>But I would note that the planes would not have stopped the attack we saw near the Polish border.&nbsp; They have a squadron of planes.&nbsp; And what has effectively helped them fight back is the types of military assistance that they have been utilizing.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And are you prepared &#8212; can you give us any more details about what that threat means of severe consequences?&nbsp; The President obviously made the same threat last week.&nbsp; Is that purely economic consequences, or would there potentially be a military component there?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We&#8217;re just not going to outline in more detail from here.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a question about the Fed.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Given Senator Manchin’s opposition to Sarah Bloom Raskin, will the White House now support the Senate moving ahead to confirm the other Fed nominees?&nbsp; Why do they need to confirm all of these nominees at once?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would say, first, that Sarah Bloom Raskin is one of the most qualified individuals ever to be nominated to serve in this position.&nbsp; We remain in close touch with both her and with Chairman Brown about the next steps here.&nbsp;<br><br>But we have continued to press, and we have been pressing for all five not just to be &#8212; to be able to be voted on in the banking committee where they have the votes to move forward.&nbsp; And that is where Republicans have not showed up to meet quorum.&nbsp;<br><br>So, at this point, I don&#8217;t have an update beyond reiterating our strong support for her.<br><br>Go ahead.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will the President himself address &#8212; bring up the&nbsp;<br>deaths and injuries of American journalists injured in Ukraine or killed in Ukraine?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; With?<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sorry, will the President himself address the deaths of Americans who have &#8212; American journalists who have been killed or injured in Ukraine?&nbsp; And does he have any plans to call their families?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I&#8217;m not going to outline private conversations from here at this point in time.&nbsp; Obviously, these families are in a moment of mourning right now.&nbsp; And so, beyond that, I think we&#8217;re just respecting their space and time.&nbsp;<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I could really briefly &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; just going back to COVID funding.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Obviously, this is something that White House officials stressed today.&nbsp; This is something the President addressed in his State of the Union address.&nbsp; But if this is so important for the President and the White House, will he meet with Republicans individually?&nbsp; Will he make his case to them personally?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I would note that there&#8217;s a number of Republicans who won&#8217;t even return our phone calls about the impact of the lack of COVID funding and how they will impact their constituents.&nbsp; So that&#8217;s probably the best place to start.&nbsp;<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah, I have a couple more questions on the path related &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; to the COVID funding.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yep.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How the heck are you going to get it through Congress? You have Republicans in the Senate who are making it very clear &#8212; leadership &#8212; saying that there is no Republican support for moving any more money for COVID relief because they believe &#8212; and they believe the White House hasn&#8217;t made a strong enough case &#8212; that funds can&#8217;t just be moved around to fund these priorities.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; Well, we&#8217;ve been making that case<br>publicly and privately back to earlier this year.&nbsp; So that &#8211;those are the facts.<br><br>We&#8217;ve also been, as I just noted, attempting to engage with and have these conversations with, of course, Democrats, but also Republicans.&nbsp; COVID doesn&#8217;t discriminate just by party at all.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>I think what we&#8217;re trying to do is really be very clear and direct about what the impacts will be.&nbsp; I mean, some of these programs &#8212; funding for treatments for immunocompromised, providing free tests and masks, providing free boosters and vaccines &#8212; those will impact millions of Americans, potentially, in this country, regardless of their partisan affiliation.<br><br>So what we&#8217;re doing &#8212; we&#8217;re going to, of course, leave the process and the vehicle up to Congress.&nbsp; We are encouraging them and aggressively calling for them to move these resources immediately.&nbsp; And we&#8217;ve &#8212; what we&#8217;ve tried to do is break down what the impacts are going to be on different states and also when specific programs will end, so that it doesn&#8217;t feel like just a number but feels like a direct impact on programs and people&#8217;s lives.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In terms of whether money can be moved around, I know you&#8217;ve said before that it can&#8217;t be moved around.&nbsp; What we&#8217;re hearing from the Hill is that they believe there&#8217;s about $100 million that could be shifted.&nbsp; And certainly, there was an agreement with the four leaders to shift funds that fell apart, in part because governors balked.&nbsp; But is there money that could be moved?&nbsp; Do these dire consequences have to start next week, or could funds be shifted and then later allocated?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, the opposition, as you note, prevented that from being a portion of what moved forward.&nbsp; Right?&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know that that opposition has changed at this point in time.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>But also, it&#8217;s important to note that we believe that this should be provided on an emergency basis, not something where it would require offsets.&nbsp; It shouldn&#8217;t have to require taking money from states who are using it for different programs, whether it&#8217;s funding COPS or police officers or other programs.&nbsp;<br><br>That was a part of the discussion in the negotiation, but I’m not aware of any change in the appro- &#8212; support for that.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On domestic energy &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; has the White House spoken to Senator Joe Manchin about his push to use &#8212; to do more domestic oil and gas production?&nbsp; I know that Senator Manchin has been interested in the President using the DPA &#8212; the Defense Production Act &#8212; to complete that pipeline from West Virginia to Virginia, the Mountain Valley pipeline.&nbsp; Is the White House interested in that?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, we&#8217;ve engaged with a range of members, Democrats and Republicans, including Senator Manchin, about a range of ideas they have.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why so many things are on the table.<br><br>I would note that the use of the Defense Production Act, broadly speaking, would mean you&#8217;re paying a company to do what they already have the capacity and the ability to do.&nbsp; We know there are 9,000 unused and approved oil leases right now that these oil companies could tap into and do more in.<br><br>In terms of the building of a pipeline, that does not sound like it&#8217;s an immediate solve for what we&#8217;re seeing right now is an increase of cost at the gas pump.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, if I could walk you back for a moment through the logic train that you were trying to lay out for us of the risk of sending, in that case, the Polish jets &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; but, in general, versus the rewards for it here.<br><br>So, if I understand it right, the President is determined that giving Ukrainian pilots these MiGs would directly involve the United States in the conflict, and therefore that&#8217;s what creates the high risk.&nbsp; Is that right?&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, David, it&#8217;s not the President&#8217;s assessment, or certainly not my assessment.&nbsp; It was the assessment by the Department of Defense.&nbsp; And a big part of their assessment was related to where these planes would take off from and how would you get them into Ukraine.&nbsp; So that was something we were exploring and discussing with a range of partners.&nbsp;<br><br>But their assessment was also ba- &#8212; was based specifically on the transfer of it to Ukraine and that that may be mistaken as escalatory.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So the fact that they would take off from a Polish base, even a base in Germany (inaudible) makes that base a legitimate military target, and they don&#8217;t want to take that risk?&nbsp; Is that what you&#8217;re telling us?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I wouldn&#8217;t say we’d say “legitimate.”&nbsp; But that it could be perceived as escalatory, yes.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; So, on the other side of this, we are transferring anti-aircraft equipment to them.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It&#8217;s got to originate someplace in the West, right?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Somehow, it&#8217;s got to get in place.&nbsp; What&#8217;s the<br>distinction?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We&#8217;re able to move a lot of that equipment in a way that is not taking off from a NATO airbase without getting into specifics of how it&#8217;s transferred.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But it’s originating from the West in some way.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Correct.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s known.&nbsp; Yes.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And there are some other possibilities of things you could be providing them with.&nbsp; For example, you mentioned that the missile strike near the Polish border wouldn&#8217;t have really been helped by the &#8212;&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; by these.&nbsp; And I think that we&#8217;re all in agreement with that.<br><br>You could imagine a series of shorter-range anti-missile systems &#8212; like what we give to the &#8212; provide and they manufacture in Israel &#8212; to ward off incoming short-range missile. Is there discussion of that kind of anti-missile system to prevent exactly what you just described?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah, it&#8217;s a good question, David.&nbsp; You probably know more about military equipment than anyone except for the Department of Defense.&nbsp; So here we are.<br><br>But look, I would really &#8212; those discussions happen at the Department of Defense.&nbsp; They consider &#8212; and we&#8217;ve talked a lot about the risk assessment as it relates to the planes &#8212; but they make assessments about what to provide to be most effective, as they provide any range of military equipment.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Again, as you know, there&#8217;s a big portion of the omnibus, which we&#8217;ll be able to detail more soon, that will be security assistance, just like there&#8217;s economic and humanitarian assistance.&nbsp; And I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll have more details on what will be included in there.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And one last one.&nbsp; Are you encouraging any of our other NATO Allies, including Turkey, to do these kinds of transfers, particularly of the anti-aircraft?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, I think you &#8212; oh, sorry, the second piece of military equipment you mentioned: Look, there&#8217;s a range of discussions, as you know, among military counterparts and defense counterparts about what equipment is needed, who has that equipment, how to provide it, but I don&#8217;t have more to detail that on from here.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But &#8212; on Turkey &#8212; it would solve a particular running problem that you&#8217;ve had since you were &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yes.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; speaking from the podium at the State Department.&nbsp; Is there any particular discussion underway with Turkey on this (inaudible)?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I just don&#8217;t have more details on that for you.&nbsp; I&#8217;m happy to check if there&#8217;s more.<br><br>Go ahead, Karen.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there a plan for the President to talk to President Zelenskyy before he delivers those remarks tomorrow to Congress?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I&#8217;m happy to check.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not &#8212; there&#8217;s not a call currently on the schedule.&nbsp; He just spoke with him last Friday.&nbsp; But again, our National Security Advisor, a range of officials here are in touch with senior members of their national security team every day.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I know you said the President is going to, of course, be talking about the $13.6 billion in aid to Ukraine when he gives remarks in a few minutes.&nbsp; You said earlier that the United States is working to get Ukraine equipment as quickly as possible.&nbsp; Can you walk us through the timeline on the $13.6? How quickly will that get out?&nbsp; Is it going out all at once?&nbsp; Are there stages?&nbsp; What&#8217;s the plan for that?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I expect we&#8217;ll have more on that in the next 24 to 48 hours.&nbsp; I understand the question.&nbsp; We&#8217;re looking forward to detailing it for you.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; Yesterday, the President spoke again about his desire to see legislation passed aimed at lowering cost of prescription drugs and childcare.&nbsp; Can you provide an update on the White House&#8217;s conversations with Senate Democrats about passing narrowly tailored legislation that would include those programs and others that the President again said would ease inflationary pressures?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I would just say that we found and we made the determination after last fall that keeping those conversations private is the best way to hopefully make progress.&nbsp; And so, we&#8217;re engaged on a daily basis, with conversations with Senate Democrats, committee members, staff about how to move this forward.&nbsp;<br><br>As I think you know and others know who talk to members, there&#8217;s a lot of excitement and enthusiasm for getting these things done, specifically lowering the cost of prescription drugs.&nbsp;<br><br>What the President wants to do is have as much of the package included as there can be 50 votes for.&nbsp; But we&#8217;re going to leave those conversations to happen through private channels &#8212; a lot of them happening member-to-member on the Hill.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any sense of timing of when that can happen with the April recess coming up soon?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Again, I&#8217;m just not going to provide an update from here because we feel that these talks are best kept between members and kept between conversations we have with our staff and them.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; And speaking of Senate Democrats, the Senate Judiciary Committee will hold its hearings next week &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; on the President’s Supreme Court nominee.&nbsp; How is the White House preparing for those hearings?&nbsp; And specifically, how is it preparing Judge Jackson for the scrutiny that she could come under from Republicans who sit on that committee?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, first, Judge Jackson, I think as you&#8217;ve seen, has been meeting with &#8212; working to meet with every member on the committee before her hearing and made a great deal of progress on exactly that.&nbsp;<br><br>I think you could &#8212; I would note that you&#8217;ve heard members come out, senators come out of &#8212; who agree with us on very little, who&#8217;ve come out and conveyed that she&#8217;s qualified and that they had good conversations with her.&nbsp; So that&#8217;s part of it.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>As soon as she was nominated, she started practicing and studying and preparing, which I don&#8217;t think surprises anyone who&#8217;s looked at her impeccable credentials and record to date.&nbsp; And I expect that will continue until she starts the hearings early next week.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; On the refugee crisis from Ukraine, is there any conversation about the role the U.S. could play to alleviate some of the burden felt by Poland?&nbsp; For example, either something similar to what we set up coming out of Afghanistan: airlifting people, expediting processing, especially for those who have family members in the U.S.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; We are having ongoing, internal discussions about how we can play the most effective role in supporting the large number of refugees who are coming out of Ukraine.&nbsp;<br><br>To date, that has been, as you know, an enormous amount of humanitarian assistance that we&#8217;re providing not just to Ukraine, but to neighboring countries that are providing a haven for refugees as they&#8217;re leaving Ukraine.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>In terms of other discussions, I just can&#8217;t outline those at this point in time, but we are continuing to discuss what options there are.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But there are conversations about helping Ukrainians come to America as well?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We&#8217;re discussing &#8212; the President would welcome Ukrainians coming here.&nbsp; Obviously, they currently &#8212; they could apply through the refugee process, but we&#8217;re continuing to discuss what options may exist.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And one more on Title 42.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We saw, over the weekend, the CDC end Title 42 restrictions for unaccompanied minors.&nbsp; And a couple of the reasons they gave were the larger public health conditions, but also that appropriate mitigation measures had been put into place in the care facilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; Yeah.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, is the administration asking DHS to put those same mitigation measures in place in other detention facilities so you can end Title 42 for everyone?&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, any decision made by the CDC about ending Title 42 would have &#8212; would &#8212; once they make the decision, it would have to be implemented, to your point, on &#8212; by DHS and other components of the interagency that oversee these facilities and ensure that they&#8217;re meeting the bars that would be required.&nbsp; But the first step would really be CDC making a decision about ending it for other populations.&nbsp;<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; Two topics.&nbsp; First, the Prime Ministers of Poland, Czech Republic, and Slovenia went to Kyiv today.&nbsp; Does the White House have any comment on that?&nbsp; You know, would an American administration official make a similar trip?&nbsp; Or conversely: Is there concern that that&#8217;s a security risk where if something were to happen to them, that that could be an escalation with NATO members?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, we certainly hope that is not the outcome.&nbsp; We respect the role they&#8217;re playing in diplomacy right now.&nbsp; And obviously, going directly into the middle of a war zone shows their strong support for President Zelenskyy, for the Ukrainian military, for Ukrainians, and we certainly support that.&nbsp;<br><br>And I&#8217;m certain we will engage with them following their trip as a follow-up, as we have been doing with other leaders who have engaged with the Ukrainians and the Russians.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; In terms of any step or trip by a member of the national security team or others, I don&#8217;t have anything to predict for you at this point in time.&nbsp; But, you know, we will continue to assess whether that would be constructive or help move things in a positive direction.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then on another matter, there are a few more members of the House of Representatives who tested positive for COVID today &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; adding to some who, over the weekend, did the same, many of whom were Democrats at the retreat on Friday where they saw the President &#8212; not many masks worn.&nbsp; Has the President been tested for COVID since?&nbsp; And are there any concerns about exposures he may have had?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; He was tested on Sunday, and he tested negative.&nbsp; All of the members to date, prior to today &#8212; and I&#8217;m happy to double check the specific piece &#8212; were not deemed as “close contacts.”&nbsp; They are all vaccinated as well, so the CDC wouldn&#8217;t recommend a change in behavior as a result.&nbsp; But he received a negative test just a couple days ago.<br><br>Good ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.&nbsp; On oil suppliers: Canada has been looking at increasing its flow of crude oil.&nbsp; Can you confirm that conversation that&#8217;s been happening between the administration and the Canadian government?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I know we&#8217;ve been closely engaged with Canada about a range of issues.&nbsp; In terms of the specifics of a conversation about oil and crude, I&#8217;d have to check with our team on that.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; And there&#8217;s been a report yesterday about the possibility that India could take up an Russian offer of discounted crude oil.&nbsp; What would be your message to India or any other country tempted by such an offer?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, our message to any country continues to be that, obviously, abide by the sanctions, but &#8212; that we have put in place and recommended.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t believe this would be violating that.&nbsp; But also think about where you want to stand when the history books are written in this moment in time.&nbsp; And support for Ru- &#8212; the Russian leadership is support for an invasion that obviously is having a devastating impact.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.&nbsp; There&#8217;s reporting that Saudi Arabia is considering accepting the yen instead of the dollar for Chinese oil.&nbsp; Is the White House monitoring that possibility?&nbsp; And has the administration communicated that there would be any types of consequences if that happened?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Let me check with the Treasury Department on it.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a good question.&nbsp; I hadn&#8217;t seen the report.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll check with them.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, could you speak to the urgency for getting this additional COVID funding from Congress at a moment when it seems that a lot of the attention and focus has been on moving away from the pandemic?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; Well, even as we have focused on conveying we have &#8212; that we are in a different stage and we have a range of the tools in order to fight the pandemic, in order to continue our capacity of having those tools, we need money.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>And we&#8217;ve always planned &#8212; been &#8212; what we&#8217;ve done effectively is planned ahead &#8212; right? &#8212; ensuring that if we get to a point &#8212; and we&#8217;ve seen, obviously, BA.2, which we&#8217;ve talked about a bit in here, which I think as of yesterday was about 25 percent to a third of the cases here.&nbsp; Very transmissible but treatable by all the means that we have.<br><br>We need to have masks, tests, boosters, treatments for immunocompromised in order to continue to treat &#8212; treat the pandemic &#8212; or treat the American people during a pandemic.&nbsp; So, it remains urgent.&nbsp; If we don&#8217;t get this funding, we won&#8217;t be able to ensure we have &#8212; can provide free access to the American people.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey, Jen.&nbsp; Just to confirm: The U.S. and allies &#8212; we’re publicly arming the Ukrainians, but we are deliberately avoiding shipping from NATO countries to Ukraine?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; That&#8217;s not what I said.&nbsp; What I said was planes taking off from a NATO base, our Department of Defense assessed that that would be a step that would be escalatory as they were making a risk assessment.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So avoiding doing it from NATO bases?&nbsp; Okay.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Of planes.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Via planes.&nbsp; But ground is another situation?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I’m not going to give you detail or confirm where our military moves from for obvious reasons.&nbsp; Because our objective is to provide that to the Ukrainians.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And on these journa- &#8212; these tragic, you know, deaths of journalists that you mentioned, is there any reason to conclude that the Russians are deliberately targeting them?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We have seen from the beginning that they have targeted hospitals, they&#8217;ve targeted journalists.&nbsp; In terms of these individual cases, I can&#8217;t make an assessment of that from here.&nbsp; But certainly, we&#8217;ve seen, you know, barbaric and horrific actions by the military on the ground, and this is consistent with that.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, aside from the request for weapons, President Zelenskyy has also requested that the U.S. be more involved in negotiations toward a peaceful resolution to the war.&nbsp; What is the U.S. doing to push those negotiations forward?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, one of the steps we&#8217;ve taken &#8212; a significant one &#8212; is to be the largest provider of military and humanitarian and economic assistance in the world, to put them in a greater position of strength as they go into these negotiations.&nbsp;<br><br>We also engage and talk with the Ukrainians on a daily basis.&nbsp; And the President and this national security team has rallied the world in being unified in their opposition to the actions of President Putin.<br><br>So, those are the steps we&#8217;re taking.&nbsp; We also engage, oftentimes before and after any conversations that any of these global leaders are having with both Russians and Ukrainians, and encourage them to make sure they&#8217;re engaging with Ukrainians directly.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so would Zelenskyy be empowered by the United States to reach an agreement with Russia and have U.S. sanctions released as a result?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, he&#8217;s the leader of Ukraine, so he&#8217;s empowered to have a negotiation with Russia.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re here to support those efforts.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So that’s a “yes”?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Again, I&#8217;m not going to get ahead of a negotiation.&nbsp; But we are here to support those efforts.&nbsp; We discuss and have conversations with hi- &#8212; with his team on a daily basis.<br><br>Go ahead, George.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; Let me ask you about Thursday&#8217;s meeting between the President and the Irish Taoiseach.&nbsp; Does the &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; Best day of the year.&nbsp; (Laughter.)<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; Does the White House view that as in any way a sign that we&#8217;re getting back to normal after two years of canceled meetings, canceled parades, and last year of having to do it virtually?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; Well, the President is very much looking forward to welcoming the Taoiseach here on Thursday to celebrate St. Patrick&#8217;s Day.&nbsp; We have started to have some events where there are more people, where there is some food or beverage served, and certainly this will be a continuation of that.<br><br>And while we are still taking steps and precautions here in the White House, including regular testing, this is certainly a step that we welcome being able to invite our friends in to celebrate on Thursday.<br><br>Go ahead, Ed.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; So, China &#8212;&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; And you’ve got to gather soon.&nbsp; Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; Quickly, going back to China.&nbsp; So, right now, you&#8217;re saying that China and the Chinese companies are not breaking sanctions by doing normal economic relations with Russia?&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I did not provide an update or an assessment of that from here, and nor do I have one to provide you.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So without talking about red lines, what would the U.S. need to see for them &#8212; for that to be a breaking of the sanctions?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I understand your question.&nbsp; I&#8217;m just not going to &#8212; going to outline it from here.&nbsp; We watch closely, the world is watching closely, and our National Security Advisor was clear there will be consequences should they &#8212; should they violate our sanctions.<br><br>Thank you, everyone, so much.<br><br>2:02 P.M. EDT</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Indian Treaty Room<br>Eisenhower Executive Office Building</p>



<p>2:30 P.M. EDT</p>



<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Please &#8212; please, sit down.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, thank you, not only for being here but for what you did.</p>



<p>I want to thank the &#8212; Vice President Harris and the congressional leaders who are here today.</p>



<p>You know, in a moment, I’m going to sign this bipartisan government funding bill.&nbsp; But with this bill, we’re going to send a message to the American people &#8212; a strong message &#8212; that Democrats and Republicans can actually come together and get something done &#8212; right, Nance? &#8212; and to fulfill our most basic responsibilities: to keep the government open and running for the American people, serving the American people, investing in your communities and investing in the American people, and doing it in a fiscally responsible way.</p>



<p>This bill also includes historic funding &#8212; $13.6 billion &#8212; to address Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the impact on surrounding countries.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>Putin’s aggression against Ukraine has united people all across America, united our two parties in Congress, and united freedom-loving world.&nbsp; And this &#8212; and it’s an act with urgency and resolve that we’re doing right now that you’ve provided me the ability to &#8212; to do.</p>



<p>I want to thank the congressional leadership for working so quickly to &#8212; to make sure we have the resources we need &#8212; economic, humanitarian, and security &#8212; to continue our forceful response to this crisis.</p>



<p>We’ve already committed more than 1 billion 200 million dollars in security assistance to the people of Ukraine just over the past year.  And I &#8212; I know all of you know that; it’s preaching to the choir here.<br><br>     But we’ve been providing anti-armor &#8212; taking out tanks &#8212; air &#8212; anti-air capabilities directly &#8212; directly to the Ukrainian forces.  And we’re also facilitating significant shipments of security assistance from our Allied partners to Ukraine.</p>



<p>With this &#8212; with this new security funding and the drawdown authorities in this bill, we’re remo- &#8212; we’re moving urgently to further augment the support to the brave people of Ukraine as they defend their country.</p>



<p>And I’ll have much more to say about this tomorrow &#8212; about exactly what we’re doing in Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We&#8217;re also going to be better positioned to provide for the rapidly growing humanitarian needs of the Ukrainian people.<br><br>     This war has turned nearly 3 million Ukrainians into refugees, with numbers growing every single day.  And that&#8217;s on top of the 12 million people who require humanitarian assistance inside of Ukraine.<br><br>     The United States is helping to lead the global humanitarian response with our partners in Europe and well beyond Europe.<br><br>     In just the past few weeks, we provided nearly $293 million in humanitarian assistance to people in Ukraine and in neighboring countries.<br><br>     Our experts are on the ground in Poland and in neighboring countries, where the Vice President just came back from, to make real-time assessments of a rapidly evolving crisis, to get urgently needed humanitarian supplies to the people in need now.<br><br>     We&#8217;re airlifting emergency relief supplies into staging positions in the region &#8212; supplies like high-thermal blankets, water treatment equipment &#8212; so that they can be shipped into Ukraine.<br><br>     We&#8217;re providing essentials like soap and laundry detergent &#8212; simple-sounding things &#8212; to refugees who fled with literally nothing but the clothing on their backs.<br><br>     We&#8217;re working with partners to supply access to safe drinking water and to food rations to the people affected by this conflict.<br><br>     With U.S. support, the World Food Programme has already purchased 20,000 metric tons of food to address the growing needs of individuals affected by this conflict.<br><br>     It&#8217;s exceedingly difficult to get supplies into Ukraine while the Russian onslaught continues.  But we&#8217;re managing to get supplies into Ukraine regularly thanks to the bravery of so many frontline workers who are still at their post.  And we are supporting food assistance at refugee reception centers in frontline countries like Moldova.<br><br>     With billions more included in this bill for new humanitarian assistance, we&#8217;re going to be able to quickly ramp up our response and help alleviate the suffering that Putin&#8217;s war is causing the Ukrainian people in the region.<br><br>     This bill also provides necessary economic support for Ukraine and Ukraine’s neighbors that are impacted by this war &#8212; things like loan guarantees, direct financial support, including &#8212; including to address the needs like energy and cybersecurity.<br><br>     This bill is also going to help face our &#8212; our challenges here at home.  It sends a clear message to the American people that we&#8217;re investing in safety, health, and the future of Americans.<br><br>     Let me just mention a couple of highlights, starting with community safety.  We know what works to make our communities safer, and that&#8217;s investing in prevention and community police officers so that they can walk the streets, know the neighborhoods, and who can help restore trust and safety in the communities.<br><br>     The answer is not to abandon our streets or to choose between safety and equal justice.  It&#8217;s in funding &#8212; it&#8217;s in this funding bill, which we make sure we do both.<br><br>     This budget invests in funding for agencies like the FBI and U.S. Marshals and the Drug Enforcement Agency, but it also includes funding for COPS programs to increase community policing and the ability of the Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms tackle &#8212; to tackle gun crime.  And it funds entirely new community violence intervention programs just at the Department of Justice.<br><br>     Community violence interruption programs are programs where trusted community members work directly with the people who are most likely to commit or become victims of gun crimes.  I had a chance to meet with those leaders in one of the programs in New York City not long ago.  I saw the difference they were making every day.<br><br>     We know these programs can dramatically reduce violence, and we&#8217;re going to fund a lot more of them.<br><br>     This bill also includes grants for state and local law enforcement and crime prevention programs.  We&#8217;re talking about drug treatment programs, school violence prevention programs, programs where people who might end up in prison and instead get mandatory mental healthcare that they need.  Part of the saf- &#8212; before any crime was committed.<br><br>     Part of the safety is the ability to feel safe in gender-based &#8212; from gender-based violence. <a> I wrote a Violence Against Women Act with many in this room years ago &#8212; 28 years ago &#8212; </a>to provide protection against domestic violence, stalking, sexual assault, and to support survivors and help them find a way out of those abusive situations they were locked into because they had no means to leave, with support for race cri- &#8212; rape crip- &#8212; crisis centers, as well as housing and legal assistance. </p>



<p>The law has saved lives, and that&#8217;s helped women rebuild their lives and make children a heck of a lot safer.</p>



<p>Today, with this bill, we reauthorize and strengthen the Violence Against Women Act.&nbsp; For example &#8212; (applause).</p>



<p>For example, we&#8217;re doing more to help survivor &#8212; survivors in rural areas and in underserved communities.&nbsp; Tribal courts will now be able to exercise jurisdiction over non-Native perpetrators of sexual assault and sex trafficking.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re providing more support for legal services and for law enforcement to get the training they need to help handle the trauma survivors are experiencing.</p>



<p>Now, I’ll have more to say about the Violence Against Women Act tomorrow as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And we&#8217;re going to be able to fund significant areas of common ground in this bill, especially in areas that I &#8212; that I called in my State of the Union address a “Unity Agenda” &#8212; the things that we can accomplish together, Democrats and Republicans.</p>



<p>Two elements of that agenda are, one, beat the opioid epidemic and, two, take on the challenges of mental health, which have been exacerbated because of the COVID problem.</p>



<p>This bill supports opioid response grants that are funding that we provide to states to support opioid prevent &#8212; opioid prevention, treatment, and recovery services.</p>



<p>We also included funding for states in support of mental health services, as well as additional funding for children&#8217;s mental health services, which has increased exponentially.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve also called for increasing Pell grants to make colleges more affordable, and that is: Anyone making less than $50,000 a year, they&#8217;re eligible for a Pell grant.&nbsp; This bill delivers increasing the maximum Pell grant by $400, which will make a difference in a lot of lives.</p>



<p>Now, I would like to add a word about another investment this bill makes, one that I expect will pay dividends for hope, healing, and for our economy for generations to come.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s called ARPA-H &#8212; Advanced Research Project Agencies of Health.&nbsp; This will be a new kind of entity, an engine for innovation, a place where we&#8217;ll do high-risk, high-reward research that can drive unprecedented progress in biomedicine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s based on DARPA, the Defense Department&#8217;s Advanced Research Project Agency, that has led to breakthroughs in technologies that protect our national security, like the Internet, GPS, and so much more.</p>



<p>ARPA-H will have a singular purpose: to drive breakthroughs to prevent, detect, and treat diseases including cancer, Alzheimer&#8217;s, and diabetes, and other diseases.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, by the way, we&#8217;re providing that we can &#8212; and we&#8217;re proving that we can invest in the American people in a fiscally responsible way.</p>



<p>Last year, the deficit dropped for the first time since 2015.&nbsp; It fell by $360 billion last year.&nbsp; And this year, it&#8217;s on track to drop by more than $1 trillion.&nbsp; After four years in a row of increasing deficits before I took office, we&#8217;re now on a track to see the largest-ever decline in the deficit in American history.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>So let me close with this: Today, we&#8217;re again showing the American people that, as a country, we can come together as Democrats, Republicans, and independents and do big things; that our democracy can deliver &#8212; can deliver &#8212; and outperform autocracies; and that there&#8217;s nothing we can&#8217;t do when we do it together as the United States of America.</p>



<p>So I&#8217;d like to now invite up my Budget Director, Shalanda Young, and all the members of the Congress here today while we sign this bipartisan government funding bill.</p>



<p>Thank you all very much.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>Speaker, there you go.&nbsp; Now, I know we usually hand out pens to everyone who’s done this, but you’re all going to get a pen, but we didn’t have 18 &#8212; 15 pens up here.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; So I’m going to make sure you get it when we finish.</p>



<p>SENATOR LEAHY:&nbsp; I wanted to make sure that my signature was legible.</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Well, it is (inaudible).</p>



<p>SPEAKER PELOSI:&nbsp; See how faint mine is and how dark his is.</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Yeah, I know.&nbsp; I tell you what, Nancy &#8212; (laughs) &#8212; anyway.&nbsp; I’m going to give it a shot here, okay?</p>



<p>(The bill is signed.)&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>LEADER SCHUMER:&nbsp; All right.</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>LEADER SCHUMER:&nbsp; Give the pen to Shalanda.&nbsp; Shalanda, you get it.</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; There you go.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. YOUNG:  Thank you, sir.  (Applause.)                              </p>

<p>Last Friday marked one year since President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan into law. This historic legislation drove our economic recovery, helped students safely return to their classrooms, and allowed Americans to get back to work. Moody’s estimates that 4 million of the 7.4 million jobs created in the first year of the Biden-Harris Administration would not exist without the American Rescue Plan. Notably, since January 2021, we have created 467,000 jobs at the state and local levels and education jobs experienced the best growth on record.</p>



<p>State, local, and tribal leaders applauded the legislation today.</p>



<p><em>See below for what they’re saying:</em></p>



<p><strong><em>Governors</em></strong></p>



<p><strong>Alabama Governor Kay Ivey:</strong> “With the support of the Alabama Legislature, I’m proud to award $10 million of the State Fiscal Recovery Fund from the American Rescue Plan Act to establish COVID recovery grants for volunteer fire departments. #alpolitics” [<a href="https://twitter.com/GovernorKayIvey/status/1500865770330464257">Tweet</a>, 3/7/22]</p>



<p><strong>Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont</strong>: &#8220;Nearly one year after the American Rescue Plan passed, its positive impact is still felt in CT. Thank you to @POTUS and our congressional delegation for providing the resources to keep kids safely in school while uplifting workers and businesses during the darkest days of Covid.&#8221; [<a href="https://twitter.com/GovNedLamont/status/1501339792122040322">Tweet</a>, 3/8/22]</p>



<p><strong>Nevada Governor Sisolak</strong>: &#8220;One year ago, with the support of @SenCortezMasto, @SenJackyRosen, @repdinatitus, @RepHorsford and @RepSusieLee the #AmericanRescuePlan became law. These funds supported the COVID response &amp; we’re laser focused on investing in critical issues for Nevadans, like housing.&#8221; [<a href="https://twitter.com/GovSisolak/status/1502382779597680640">Tweet</a>, 3/11/22]</p>



<p><strong>New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham</strong>: &#8220;A year ago today @POTUS enacted the #AmericanRescuePlan, delivering billions to support New Mexico. ARPA has made possible innovative investments in programs that reduce costs and build a stronger foundation for New Mexico families, including a historic expansion of child care&#8230; We enacted the single largest eligibility expansion in the history of New Mexico&#8217;s child care assistance program, supporting tens of thousands more families. And we delivered $157 million to over 1,000 childcare businesses across the state, supporting providers &amp; increasing pay.&#8221; [<a href="https://twitter.com/GovMLG/status/1502355239344930817?cxt=HHwWgoDQ-auIuNkpAAAA">Tweet</a>, 3/11/22]</p>



<p><strong>Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf</strong>: &#8220;One year ago, the American Rescue Plan became law — sending Pennsylvania $13.72 billion to help us recover from the pandemic. Thank you to @POTUS and the federal lawmakers who made this plan happen. This support has been critical to our recovery&#8230; [<a href="https://twitter.com/GovernorTomWolf/status/1502268357520859136">Tweet thread</a>, 3/11/22]<strong></strong></p>



<p><strong>Vermont Governor Phil Scott</strong>: &#8220;Last year, using American Rescue Plan and state funds, we invested almost $100M for housing. With much more underway, we’ve already: • Added 800 homes • Are building 800 more • Helped over 1,300 families transition out of homelessness … This is important, but it’s not been enough to help Vermonters find affordable housing. The good news is, we have 100s of millions in ARPA funds to continue this progress. We have to act now and need legislative support to pass this year’s $145M proposed housing investment.2/2&#8221; [<a href="https://twitter.com/GovPhilScott/status/1502037050874343432">Tweet</a>, 3/11/22]</p>



<p><strong><em>Mayors</em></strong></p>



<p><strong>Albany Mayor Kathy Sheehan</strong>: &#8220;Today is the one-year anniversary of the #AmericanRescuePlan.

<p><strong>Albuquerque</strong><strong> Mayor Tim Keller: </strong>“…[ARPA] was a game-changer…especially [for] Albuquerque, because we could use it right away, and we could use it in the way we thought was best for our city… It remains to me the most helpful federal incentive or action that I’ve ever dealt with as a mayor.” [<a href="https://www.usmayors.org/2022/03/09/one-year-after-american-rescue-plan-mayors-offer-testimonials-about-importance-of-direct-local-relief-dollars/">Statement</a>, 3/9/22] <strong></strong></p>



<p><strong>Akron Mayor Dan Horrigan</strong>: “The ARPA funds are already making a big impact here in Akron. We recently announced over $1.3 million in grants to 11 local organizations working to prevent violence from occurring, stop the progression of violence, and rehabilitate individuals with a history of violent behavior. I believe it is our duty and responsibility to support organizations that are offering evidence-based programming to create a safer community, and the American Rescue Plan funding gives us the opportunity to do just that.” [<a href="https://ohiomayorsalliance.org/clips/one-year-of-arpa-what-ohios-mayors-are-saying/">Tweet</a>, 3/10/22]</p>



<p><strong>Augusta</strong><strong> Mayor Hardie Davis Jr.: </strong>“We know best how to distribute those dollars, how to meet the needs of people on the ground. And that was the key element that made these dollars so instrumental in coming to us at the time that they did. In Augusta, we used them for a number of things. Some challenges that we had, particularly in terms of law enforcement, being able to keep people – from a public safety and law enforcement perspective – on the ground.” [<a href="https://www.usmayors.org/2022/03/09/one-year-after-american-rescue-plan-mayors-offer-testimonials-about-importance-of-direct-local-relief-dollars/">Statement</a>, 3/9/22] <strong></strong></p>



<p><strong>Austin Mayor Steve Adler:</strong> &#8220;This week is the 1 year anniversary of the historic American Rescue Plan!

<p><strong>Boca Raton Mayor Scott Singer: </strong>“[ARPA funds were] a game-changer for so many communities like ours.

<p><strong>Boise Mayor Laura McLean</strong>: “Through a combination of regulatory changes and funds from the #AmericanRescuePlan, we made it easier for childcare facilities to operate.

<p><strong>Burnsville</strong><strong> Mayor Elizabeth Kautz: </strong>“Now for ARPA funds, because we only got about $8 million in my city, and so what we used the first $6 million is for cost recovery for lost revenue… I have a power plant [and natural gas plant] in my city, so we have some very critical assets. We need to make sure that we have those assets still running, because all of us, all of us, need electric power.” [<a href="https://www.usmayors.org/2022/03/09/one-year-after-american-rescue-plan-mayors-offer-testimonials-about-importance-of-direct-local-relief-dollars/">Statement</a>, 3/9/22] <strong></strong></p>



<p><strong>Cleveland Mayor Justin Bibb:</strong> “We received over $511 million dollars from President Biden through the American Rescue Plan… and I’m using that capital to do a couple things: number one, we’ve already authorized over $20 million to eradicate the digital divide, we’ve raised already over $100 million to eradicate the lead paint crisis…[and] I intend to launch an Office of Economic Recovery working with public and private partners from all across our community to make sure we can leverage this capital to truly create the right recovery that can be an inclusive economic comeback for our city in the future.” [<a href="https://www.usmayors.org/2022/03/09/one-year-after-american-rescue-plan-mayors-offer-testimonials-about-importance-of-direct-local-relief-dollars/">Statement</a>, 3/9/22] <strong></strong></p>



<p><strong>Columbus Mayor Andrew Ginther: </strong>“ICYMI: On Monday, the city and county announced $8M from the American Rescue Plan for small businesses in underserved communities led by minority, women and veteran entrepreneurs… These funds would not have been possible without the American Rescue Plan, which tomorrow celebrates its one-year anniversary. #ARPA @usmayors #Columbus #community” [<a href="https://twitter.com/MayorGinther/status/1502043168119959564">Tweet</a>, 3/10/22]</p>



<p><strong>Dayton Mayor Jeffrey J. Mims, Jr: </strong>A year ago today, @POTUS signed the #AmericanRescuePlan into law.

<p><strong>Denver Mayor Michael Hancock: </strong>“So, ARPA helped us to begin to restore those critical services and bring back our employees — everyone was furloughed for the most part, except for our uniforms…Then, we began to restore and invest in our businesses, in our community-based organizations so that they could also be responsive to our community. And we really heavily invested in housing and shelter, particularly for our most vulnerable — our homeless.” [<a href="https://www.usmayors.org/2022/03/09/one-year-after-american-rescue-plan-mayors-offer-testimonials-about-importance-of-direct-local-relief-dollars/">Statement</a>, 3/9/22] <strong></strong></p>



<p><strong>Des Moines</strong><strong> Mayor Frank Cownie: </strong>“A lot of these people started working virtually. Well, what does that do to all those businesses you know whether they’re restaurants or retail or whatever that people are starting to not frequent? And so they started laying people off, and in some cases shutting down because their workers became ill with the pandemic and COVID. And so there were lots of people that needed a lot of help. And you know they were having to try to keep a roof over their heads, make rental payments, make house payments, put food on the table.” [<a href="https://www.usmayors.org/2022/03/09/one-year-after-american-rescue-plan-mayors-offer-testimonials-about-importance-of-direct-local-relief-dollars/">Statement</a>, 3/9/22] <strong></strong></p>

<p><strong>Edina</strong><strong> Mayor Jim Hovland: </strong>“We thought we had great broadband coverage in our community, but we found out there were blind spots, bad spots for kids, so we dedicated $500,000 of that 2.4 million… [so] that they’d have the kind of access to the internet we wanted them to have… In the aftermath of the killing of George Floyd, we set up… the use of a social worker to help on some police calls where officers were being asked to cover mental health challenges… We committed about $400,000 of that [ARPA] money to enhancing that operation within our police department and also assisting our school district and our community with some outside mental health services, either for kids or families that need some assistance.” [<a href="https://www.usmayors.org/2022/03/09/one-year-after-american-rescue-plan-mayors-offer-testimonials-about-importance-of-direct-local-relief-dollars/">Statement</a>, 3/9/22] <strong></strong></p>



<p><strong>Finley</strong><strong> Mayor Christina Muryn</strong>: “With the American Rescue Plan dollars, we are being able to provide some grant opportunities to support our nonprofits in a variety of ways, certainly focusing on basic needs: food, housing, education, getting folks back to work, and childcare… [including] things like Cancer Patient Services, an organization that helps individuals who are struggling with medical bills while going through cancer treatment, or Hope House, which helps individuals that have been displaced or are seeking refuge from domestic violence.” [<a href="https://www.usmayors.org/2022/03/09/one-year-after-american-rescue-plan-mayors-offer-testimonials-about-importance-of-direct-local-relief-dollars/">Statement</a>, 3/9/22] <strong></strong></p>



<p><strong>Fremont</strong><strong> Mayor Lily Mei</strong>: “Having that ability to leverage and utilize ARPA to balance our budget allowed us to then focus some of those funds, along with the combination of county and state, to help with rental assistance. As of January to date, we have used almost $11 million of our $16 million to help provide rental assistance for over 770 families.” [<a href="https://www.usmayors.org/2022/03/09/one-year-after-american-rescue-plan-mayors-offer-testimonials-about-importance-of-direct-local-relief-dollars/">Statement</a>, 3/9/22] <strong></strong></p>

Janet Yellen to participate in a news conference with local leaders from around the nation about the American Rescue Plan&#8230; I joined the news conference to demonstrate the importance of these dollars in our community that will enhance our public safety efforts, address our homeless population, and invest in underserved neighborhoods. I also talked about the impact on our business community and the much-needed relief provided to our struggling small businesses, especially restaurants.&#8221; [<a href="https://twitter.com/MayorJerryDyer/status/1501657438553968642">Tweet</a>, 3/9/22]</p>



<p><strong>Grand Rapids Mayor Rosalynn Bliss, Chair Urban Core Mayors</strong>: “Michigan’s urban core cities were at the heart of the state’s pandemic response… One year ago, the American Rescue Plan Act gave us hope that there was light at the end of the tunnel. This federal stimulus is allowing our cities to emerge from the pandemic on a stronger footing by using these funds to help build up our small businesses and refill out downtowns. We are also able to strategically invest in core issues like housing and infrastructure so that our children can see the benefit of these funds long into the future.” [Statement, 3/11/22]</p>



<p><strong>Grove City Mayor Richard L. “Ike” Stage</strong>: “The ARPA stimulus has been a tremendous help for our community The funds were vital to the repair and update of our aging stormwater sewer infrastructure in our older neighborhoods.” [<a href="https://ohiomayorsalliance.org/clips/one-year-of-arpa-what-ohios-mayors-are-saying/">Tweet</a>, 3/10/22]</p>



<p><strong>Hallandale Beach</strong><strong> Mayor Joy Cooper</strong>: “Once we did all those calculations, we saw that within two-to-three years, the rate we were going, facing COVID closing businesses, all the other stresses and having to keep employees well and keep them paid, we were facing bankruptcy. So without the support of the federal government — which all our residents are very grateful for — as a smaller city, we really were facing really dire times, so we have really applied every, every penny of ARPA to make sure that we can balance our budget.” [<a href="https://www.usmayors.org/2022/03/09/one-year-after-american-rescue-plan-mayors-offer-testimonials-about-importance-of-direct-local-relief-dollars/">Statement</a>, 3/9/22] <strong></strong></p>



<p><strong>Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner: </strong>“We stood to lose or lay off nearly 2,000 employees if it were not for CARES funding and then the ARPA funding. It was just that bad. It would have forced us to lay off municipal workers… It was the ARPA funding that was primarily used to plug that $200 million shortfall… Do you want to lose police officers? The answer is ‘no.’ Do you want to lose firefighters? The answer is ‘no’.’ Do you need your solid waste workers, the people who pick up the trash every week? The answer is ‘absolutely’… You take away the people, you take away the services.” [<a href="https://www.usmayors.org/2022/03/09/one-year-after-american-rescue-plan-mayors-offer-testimonials-about-importance-of-direct-local-relief-dollars/">Statement</a>, 3/9/22] <strong></strong></p>



<p><strong>Huntington Mayor Steve Williams: </strong>“We put together an extremely aggressive [economic revitalization] plan… I just knew what we had to do in order to transform our community. It had to be something that was bigger than what any small town would imagine doing. But the only way you’re going to do that within a shortened time frame is it has to be big. Go big or don’t go… The big worry that I had was ‘how in God’s name am I going to pay for this.”… And then the Rescue Plan came.” [<a href="https://www.usmayors.org/2022/03/09/one-year-after-american-rescue-plan-mayors-offer-testimonials-about-importance-of-direct-local-relief-dollars/">Statement</a>, 3/9/22] <strong></strong></p>

<p><strong>Issaquah Mayor Mary Lou Pauly</strong>: &#8220;Today is the one-year anniversary of the passage of the #AmericanRescuePlan.

<p><strong>Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas: </strong>“…There is an organization in Kansas City called the KC Care Clinic. Their primary work…is working with people who are living with HIV and AIDS. And, early in the pandemic, of course, immunocompromised folks are an area of concern. Our ability to support KC Care through our federal funds has been a lifesaver for a lot of these folks, who, as I noted, weren’t going to the doctor for a while, didn’t know what part of society they could engage with, making sure they had access and consistent treatment throughout this crisis.” [<a href="https://www.usmayors.org/2022/03/09/one-year-after-american-rescue-plan-mayors-offer-testimonials-about-importance-of-direct-local-relief-dollars/">Statement</a>, 3/9/22] <strong></strong></p>



<p><strong>Lancaster Mayor David Scheffler: </strong>“The timing of these funds was important as we were able to quickly invest in a major water infrastructure project that was key to finalizing a significant economic development project for the region. These infrastructure investments can be very costly for cities but are vital to the lon-term success of our communities.” [<a href="https://ohiomayorsalliance.org/clips/one-year-of-arpa-what-ohios-mayors-are-saying/">Statement</a>, 3/11/22]</p>



<p><strong>Lakewood Mayor Meghan George</strong>: “The City of Lakewood received $47 million from the American Rescue Plan Act. More than half of those dollars will be spent on necessary improvements to our century old water/sewer infrastructure. This allows for rate reductions for every resident and business owner in our city. Additionally, we have allocated roughly $1.6 million towards homelessness prevention. We continue to explore other uses for these dollars that will make the most impact for our community.” [<a href="https://ohiomayorsalliance.org/clips/one-year-of-arpa-what-ohios-mayors-are-saying/">Tweet</a>, 3/10/22]</p>



<p><strong>Lincoln</strong><strong> Mayor Leirion Gaylor Baird</strong>: “We used our American Rescue Plan funds, first and foremost, to help stabilize small businesses in Lincoln. We’ve allocated over $7 million in grants to small businesses… provide up to six months of rent and mortgage payments… And through our exit interviews with recipients of these funds, we’ve heard that this is what helped keep them in business. This is what’s helping keep people employed who work in their companies. We’ve helped over 250 small businesses and micro businesses with those dollars from the American Rescue Plan. It really has been a lifeline for them.” [<a href="https://www.usmayors.org/2022/03/09/one-year-after-american-rescue-plan-mayors-offer-testimonials-about-importance-of-direct-local-relief-dollars/">Statement</a>, 3/9/22] <strong></strong></p>



<p><strong>Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti</strong>: &#8220;On this day, a year ago, Congress passed the American Rescue Plan — a turning point for the country, and today Los Angeles is stronger for it.

<p><strong>Louisville</strong><strong> Mayor Greg Fischer: </strong>“First and foremost, the ARPA funds were used to make sure that we could mitigate the impact of the pandemic as much as we possibly could. It literally was a lifesaver for our community. And then when you go beyond that to the type of economic uplift that ARPA has provided, and will provide even further, it allowed us to address challenges in our community that we’ve always dreamed of addressing, but we never had the resources to address. So it gives us the double impact of economic lift, and then also taking on big challenges for generational change in Louisville.” [<a href="https://www.usmayors.org/2022/03/09/one-year-after-american-rescue-plan-mayors-offer-testimonials-about-importance-of-direct-local-relief-dollars/">Statement</a>, 3/9/22] <strong></strong></p>

<p><strong>U.S. Conference of Mayors: </strong>&#8220;Friday marks the one-year anniversary of the enactment of the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA). A critical component of this legislation was direct fiscal relief to state and local governments, which were devastated by unprecedented need and budget shortfalls as a result of the pandemic.
