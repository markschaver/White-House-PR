<ol><li><strong>Weatherization: </strong>Two-thirds of low-income U.S. households have high energy burdens, meaning they spend more than 6 percent of their income on utility bills. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal will invest a historic $3.5 billion in the Weatherization Assistance Program, reducing energy costs for more than 700,000 low-income households by increasing the energy efficiency of their homes, while ensuring health and safety and creating jobs.<br></li><li><strong>Wildfires:</strong> One estimate found that 4.5 million homes in the United States are at risk of wildfire. The bill invests $8 billion in wildfire risk reduction by providing funding for community wildfire defense grants, mechanical thinning, controlled burns, the Collaborative Forest Restoration Program, and firefighting resources.<br></li><li><strong>Floods: </strong>The cost of flood damage was approximately $17 billion annually in the last decade, and is expected to increase significantly due climate-related extreme weather and rising sea levels. The bill invests $12 billion in flood mitigation, including funding for FEMA flood mitigation grants, making infrastructure investments to increase coastal resilience, and improving mapping and data so that households and businesses can better protect themselves from future flood events.<br></li><li><strong>Brownfields and superfund</strong>: 26% of Black Americans and 29% of Hispanic Americans live within 3 miles of a Superfund site, a higher percentage than for Americans overall. Proximity to a Superfund site can lead to elevated levels of lead in children’s blood. The deal invests $5 billion in addressing legacy pollution at these sites, creating good-paying union jobs and advancing economic and environmental justice.<br></li><li><strong>Natural gas wells and coal mines: </strong>In thousands of rural and urban communities around the country, hundreds of thousands of former industrial and energy sites, including orphan wells and abandoned land mines, are now idle – sources of blight and pollution. The deal invests $16 billion in creating good-paying union jobs capping these wells and mines.<br></li><li><strong>Pipeline safety:</strong> More than 20,000 miles of cast iron pipelines—much of which was installed in the 1800’s and early 1900’s—transports natural gas underneath communities in the U.S. This infrastructure, which is prone to leaks and fugitive methane emissions, is mostly located in disadvantaged areas including older cities like Philadelphia, Detroit, Baltimore, New York, and St. Louis.&nbsp; Since 2010, the U.S. has experienced thousands of pipeline incidents, resulting in hundreds of injuries and deaths, tens of thousands of evacuations, and more than $4 billion in damages. The bill includes $1 billion for the “Natural Gas Distribution Infrastructure Safety and Modernization Grant Program” to modernize natural gas distribution pipelines, reducing incidents and fatalities, and avoiding economic losses.<br></li><li><strong>Battery manufacturing: </strong>Today, the U.S. relies heavily on importing advanced battery components from abroad, exposing the nation to supply chain vulnerabilities that threaten to disrupt the availability and cost of these technologies, as well as the workforce that manufactures them. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal will invest $6B to spur U.S. advanced battery processing, manufacturing, and recycling, creating good-paying jobs and enabling American manufacturers to win the 21<sup>st</sup> century. &nbsp;<br></li><li><strong>Safe Streets:</strong> Over 36,000 Americans died in motor vehicle crashes in 2019, including over 6,200 pedestrians and about 850 bicyclists. The United States has one of the highest traffic fatality rates in the industrialized world, double the rate in Canada and quadruple that in Europe. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal includes $5 billion for a first-of-its kind “Safe Streets for All” program to fund state and local “vision zero” plans and other improvements to reduce crashes and fatalities, especially for the most vulnerable of roadways users.<br></li><li><strong>Transit station ADA program: </strong>More than 30 years after the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act, nearly 1,000 transit stations are still not fully accessible, which prevents millions of older Americans and individuals with disabilities from fully enjoying public transit. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal includes a total of $2 billion for transit ADA, including $1.75 billion for All Stations Accessibility and $250 million for Enhanced Mobility for Seniors and Individuals with Disabilities. These programs will remove barriers to transportation service and expand transportation mobility options for Americans across the country.<br></li><li><strong>Cybersecurity: </strong>The recent cybersecurity breaches of federal government data systems, critical infrastructure, and American businesses underscore the importance and urgency of strengthening U.S. cybersecurity capabilities. The bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act will invest about $2 billion to modernize and secure federal, state, and local IT and networks; protect critical infrastructure and utilities; and support public or private entities as they respond to and recover from significant cyberattacks and breaches.</li></ol>

<p>4:29 P.M. EDT<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Good afternoon.&nbsp; Last week, I laid out what we need to do to beat the COVID-19 vi- &#8212; pandemic and the challenges posed by the Delta variant.<br><br>This is a very different variant than what we’ve dealt with previously.&nbsp; It’s highly transmissible, and it’s causing a new wave of cases.&nbsp; It accounts for over 80 percent of all COVID-19 cases in the United States today.&nbsp; Experts tell us that we’re going to see these cases rise in the weeks ahead &#8212; a largely preventable tragedy that will get worse before it gets better.<br><br>What’s different about this surge from previous ones is we have the tools to prevent this rise in cases from shutting down<br>our businesses, our schools, our society, as we saw what happened last year.<br><br>And while cases are on the rise, it’s important to note we&#8217;ve not seen a comparable rise in hospitalizations or deaths in most areas of the country.<br><br>That’s because 165 million Americans are fully vaccinated, including 80 percent of the most vulnerable Americans &#8212; our seniors.<br><br>The best line of defense against the Delta vac- &#8212; the virus is the vaccine.&nbsp; It&#8217;s as simple as that.&nbsp; Period.&nbsp; The vaccine.<br><br>I want to be crystal clear about what’s happening in the country today: We have a pandemic of the unvaccinated.<br><br>Now, I know there’s a lot of misinformation out there, so here are the facts: If you&#8217;re vaccinated, you are highly unlikely to get COVID-19.&nbsp; And even if you do, the chances are you won’t show any symptoms; and if you do, they’ll most likely be very mild.<br><br>Vaccinated people almost never are hospitalized with COVID-19.&nbsp; In fact, according to one recent study, 95 percent of overall COVID-19 hospitalizations are among those not fully vaccinated.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>And the data shows that virtually all the cases, hospitalizations, and deaths due to COVID-19 are from the unvaccinated population.<br><br>Last month, a study showed that over 99 percent of COVID-19 deaths have among &#8212; have been among the unvaccinated people.&nbsp; Ninety-nine percent.<br><br>That means, if you’re unvaccinated, you are much more likely to, one, get COVID-19; two, get hospitalized; and, three, die if you get it.&nbsp;<br><br>This is a tragedy.&nbsp; People are dying and will die who don’t have to die.&nbsp; The data is absolutely clear: As I&#8217;ve said, we have a pandemic of the unvaccinated.<br><br>Think of it this way: A hundred and ninety-one million Americans have gotten at least one shot, including 70 percent of adults over the age of 18.&nbsp; A hundred and sixty-five million Americans are fully vaccinated, but about ninety million Americans are eligible for vaccines and still haven’t gotten their first shot.<br><br>You know, I think there&#8217;s a clear link between the lowest-vaccinated &#8212; I know &#8212; I don&#8217;t think, actually &#8212; the lowest-vaccinated states and the states with the highest case rates.<br><br>This past week, the most vaccinated state in America,<br>Vermont, has seen just five new cases &#8212; five &#8212; per day of COVID-19 for every 100,000 people who live in that state.&nbsp; That means, on any given day, only 30 people in the entire state of Vermont got COVID-19.&nbsp;<br><br>Nearby Maine, which has vaccinated almost 80 percent of their adults, has seen just six new cases per 100,000.&nbsp;<br><br>But the states with the lowest vaccination rates are seeing 10 to 20 times as many new cases per 100,000 people.&nbsp; It’s moving like wildfire through the unvaccinated community.&nbsp; And it’s heartbreaking, particularly because it’s preventable.<br><br>That’s why we’re doing everything we can to get more people vaccinated.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re seeing real results.<br><br>In the past two weeks, we have seen a 55 percent increase in the average number of new people getting vaccinated every day.<br><br>In the last seven days alone, nearly 3 million Americans have gotten their first shot.&nbsp; That’s the highest seven-day total in a month.<br><br>Importantly, over the past two weeks, the eight states with the highest current case rates have seen a doubling of the number of people newly vaccinated each day.&nbsp; The message is getting through, apparently.<br><br>Louisiana has seen a 212 percent increase in the average number of newly vaccinated people in that state per day, going from 3,600 to over 11,000 people vaccinated per day.<br><br>Arkansas is up 99 percent.&nbsp; Mississippi is up 125 percent.&nbsp; Alabama is up 186 percent &#8212; going from 3,200 to 9,150 people vaccinated per day.&nbsp; This will make a big difference.<br><br>These are encouraging signs.&nbsp; We have to continue our aggressive efforts to vaccinate the unvaccinated.<br><br>Last week, I announced additional steps to incentivize Americans to get vaccinated, including calling on states to offer $100 for anyone willing to step up and get a vaccination shot.&nbsp;<br><br>You know, and already Minnesota and New Mexico have done that.&nbsp; And North Carolina announced its 100-day incentive &#8212; its $100 incentive today.<br><br>Places that have offered the hundred thou- &#8212; the hundred thousand &#8212; (laughs) &#8212; the hundred dollars &#8212; that’d be really good.&nbsp; I’d go back and get vaccinated three times. &nbsp;(Laughter.) But all kidding aside, offered the $100 to get vaccination have seen an uptick of 25 percent of daily vaccination rates.<br><br>We also announced that small- and medium-sized businesses will be fully reimbursed for offering paid time off for their employees to get vaccinated and for them to take a child or a parent to get vaccinated.<br><br>And I announced some tough, sometimes unpopular steps to keep people safe and our economy strong.&nbsp; All federal workers must report their vaccination status or be subject to strict requirements.&nbsp; Any federal worker who does not attest to their vaccination status or is not vaccinated will be required to mask no matter where they work, test one to twice a week, socially distance, and generally will not be allowed to travel for work.<br><br>I directed my administration to take steps to apply similar standards to all federal contractors.&nbsp; If you want to do business with the federal government, get your workers vaccinated.<br><br>And I also directed the Pentagon to look at adding COVID-19 to the list of vaccinations that are required for our troops because others are required.<br><br>I approved the Department of Veterans Affairs to require doctors, nurses, and other healthcare workers who care for our veterans to be vaccinated.<br><br>And the good news is that now many are following the federal government’s lead.&nbsp; In the past several days, states and local officials have come out to impose similar vaccination mandates.<br><br>And the private sector is stepping up as well.&nbsp; Even Fox has vaccination requirements.&nbsp; I want to thank Walmart, Google, Netflix, Disney, Tyson Foods for their recent actions requiring vaccination for employees.<br><br>Look, I know this isn’t easy, but I will have their backs and the backs of other private and public sector leaders if they take such steps.<br><br>But others have declined to step up.&nbsp; I find it disappointing.&nbsp; And worst of all, some state officials are passing laws or signing orders that forbid people from doing the right thing.&nbsp;<br><br>As of now, seven states not only ban mask mandates, but also ban them in their school districts, even for young children who cannot get vaccinated.&nbsp; Some states have even banned businesses and universities from requiring workers and students to be masked or vaccinated.<br><br>And the most extreme of those measures is like the one in Texas that say state universities or community colleges could be fined if it allows a teacher to ask her unvaccinated students to wear a mask.&nbsp;<br><br>What are we doing?<br><br>COVID-19 is a national challenge, and we must come together &#8212; we have to come together &#8212; all of us together, as a country, to solve it.<br><br>Make no mistake: The les- &#8212; the exc- &#8212; ex- &#8212; excuse me &#8212; the escalation of cases is particularly concentrated in states with low vaccination rates.&nbsp; Just two states, Florida and Texas, account for one third of all new COVID-19 cases in the entire country.&nbsp; Just two states.&nbsp;<br><br>Look, we need leadership from everyone.&nbsp; And if some governors aren’t willing to do the right thing to beat this pandemic, then they should allow businesses&nbsp;and universities who want to do the right thing to be able to do it.&nbsp;<br><br>I say to these governors, “Please, help.”&nbsp; But if you aren’t going to help, at least get out of the way of the people who are trying to do the right thing.&nbsp; Use your power to save lives.<br><br>I’ve made it our first and top priority to have a vaccine available for every single American from the day I got elected.&nbsp; That was my priority.&nbsp; And let me be clear: We have a supply for every single American, and that will never change.<br><br>At the same time, it’s also in our national interest to share some of our vaccines with the world, which gets me to the second thing I want to discuss today.<br><br>From the beginning of my presidency, I’ve been very clear-eyed that we need to attack this virus globally, not just at home, because it’s in America’s self-interest to do so.<br><br>The virus knows no boundaries.&nbsp; You can’t build a wall high enough to keep it out.&nbsp; There is no wall high enough or ocean wide enough to keep us safe from a vaccination in other &#8212; from the COVID-19 in other countries.<br><br>In fact, just like the original virus that caused COVID-19, the Delta variant came from abroad.&nbsp; As long as the virus continue to rage outs- &#8212; rage outside the United States, potentially more dangerous variants could arrive at our shores again.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>And we know that COVID-19 in other countries stifles economic growth, disrupts supply chains, risks instability and weakness of governments.&nbsp; And as we’ve seen in the United States, the key to growing economies is to vaccinate people.&nbsp;<br><br>So just as the American economy is recovering, it’s in all of our interests to have global &#8212; the global economy begin to recover as well.&nbsp;<br><br>This is about our values.&nbsp; We value inherent dignity of all people &#8212; the inherent dignity of everyone.&nbsp; In times of trouble, Americans reach out to offer a helping hand.&nbsp; That’s who we are.<br><br>And I’ve said before: In this fight against COVID-19, the United States is committed to be the arsenal of vaccines, just as we were the arsenal of democracy during World War Two.<br><br>And we’re backing up that commitment.&nbsp; We have contributed more than any other nation to COVAX &#8212; the collective global efforts delivering COVID-19 vaccines across the world.<br><br>We have supported manufacturing efforts abroad through our partnerships with Japan, India, Australia –- known as “the Quad.”<br><br>During my trip to Europe in June, I announced that the United States would purchase a groundbreaking 500 million doses of Pfizer and then donate them &#8212; those doses &#8212; nearly &#8212; to nearly a hundred low- and middle-income countries who don’t have the vaccine.&nbsp; Those doses will start to ship at the end of this month.&nbsp;<br><br>We also announced that we’d donate 80 million doses of our own vaccine to supply the world, which has already begun.&nbsp;<br><br>And today, I have an important update.&nbsp; We’ve already exceeded 80 million doses that have been &#8212; gone out.&nbsp; As of today, the United States has shipped over 110 million doses of U.S. vaccines to 65 countries that are among the hardest hit in the world.<br><br>Let me say it again: As of today, we have shipped over 110 million doses to 65 nations.<br><br>According to the United Nations, this is more than the donations of all 24 countries that have donated any vaccine to other countries, including China and Russia &#8212; all those nations combined.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These vaccine donations from America are free.&nbsp; We’re not selling them.&nbsp; There are no demands, no conditions, no coercion attached.&nbsp; And there is no favoritism and no strings attached.&nbsp; We’re doing this to save lives and to end this pandemic.&nbsp; That’s it.<br><br>In fact, we’re donating vaccines to countries that have real issues &#8212; we have real issues with.<br><br>And we’ll continue to give tens of millions of the doses away across the summer and work to increase U.S. manufacturing and manufacturing of vaccines around the world as well.<br><br>And it’s not just vaccines.&nbsp; We are continuing to provide<br>countries with &#8212; in need &#8212; with more testing, protective equipment, and personnel to stem the surge of the virus.&nbsp; We’ve done it in India and elsewhere.<br><br>Let me close with this.&nbsp; I’ve said before: In the race for the 21st century between democracies and autocracies, we need to prove that democracies can deliver.&nbsp;<br><br>And the democracies of the world are looking to America to lead again &#8212; in two ways.&nbsp; First, to demonstrate we can control this virus at home.&nbsp; And second, to show we can help address it around the world.<br><br>Vaccinate America and help vaccinate the world &#8212; that’s how we’re about to beat this thing.<br><br>We’re always going to have enough doses for every American who wants one.&nbsp; Our work in donating vaccines to the world is about America following through on our promises and delivering what we say we’ll deliver.<br><br>It’s showing how American science and technology, American businesses and academia, and our government can all work together.<br><br>Above all, it’s proving democracies can deliver and, yet again, that America is back leading the world &#8212; not by the example of our power, but by the power of our example.<br><br>We still have a lot of work to do.&nbsp; So if you’re unvaccinated, please, please, please get the shot.&nbsp;<br><br>But just don’t take it from me.&nbsp; Just read the news.&nbsp; Listen to the voices of the unvaccinated patients in the hospital.&nbsp; They are <s>spending</s> [sending] the most powerful message to their families and everyone around the world &#8212; a powerful message to everybody.&nbsp; As they’re lying in bed, many dying from COVID-19, they’re asking, “Doc, can I get the vaccine?”&nbsp; The doctors have to look them in the eye and say, “No, sorry.&nbsp; It&#8217;s too late.”<br><br>Right now, too many people are dying or watching a loved one dying and saying, “If I just got vaccinated.&nbsp; If I just…”<br><br>Folks, this is isn’t about politics.&nbsp; The virus doesn’t care if you’re a Democrat or a Republican.&nbsp; This is about life and death.&nbsp; Life and death.<br><br>I can’t say it any more plainly than this: The vaccine saves lives, and it could save yours or your child’s.<br>You know, I know we can do this.&nbsp; We’re the United States of America.&nbsp; We’re prepared like never before.&nbsp; We have the tools and the resources to save lives at home and around the world.&nbsp;<br><br>This is who we are.&nbsp; This is what we do.&nbsp; This is why there&#8217;s no nation like us on Earth.<br><br>God bless you all.&nbsp; And may God protect our troops.&nbsp;<br><br>And I’ll take a few questions.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. President, I have a question for you on coronavirus, but first I&#8217;d like to start with the news of the day &#8212; given, back in March, you said that if the investigation confirmed the allegations against Governor Cuomo, then he should resign.&nbsp; So, will you now call on him to resign, given the investigators said the 11 women were credible?<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; I stand by that statement.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are you now calling on him to resign?<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Yes.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And if he doesn&#8217;t resign, do you believe he should be impeached and removed from office?<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Let&#8217;s take one thing at a time here.&nbsp; I think he should resign.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you think &#8212;<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; I understand that the state legislature may decide to impeach.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know that for a fact; I&#8217;ve not read all that data.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And he&#8217;s using a photo of you embracing him in his self-defense to say that these are commonplace kind of embraces that he made in the allegations against him.&nbsp; Do you condone that?<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Look, I&#8217;m not going to flyspeck this.&nbsp; I&#8217;m sure there are some embraces that were totally innocent, but app- &#8212; apparently, the Attorney General decided there were things that weren’t.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And on coronavirus, if I could ask you a question about the evictions.<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Why don’t you come up and take the platform?&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No, thank you.&nbsp;<br><br>On the evictions and the moratorium that lapsed on Saturday night: What is your strategy to prevent potentially millions of people from being evicted from their homes, given what we are told your administration is considering &#8212; a targeted moratorium &#8212; is likely to face legal challenges?<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Any call for a moratorium based on the Supreme Court recent decision is likely to face obstacles.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve indicated to the CDC I&#8217;d like them to look at other alternatives than the one that is in pow- &#8212; in existence, which the Court has declared they&#8217;re not going to allow to continue.&nbsp; And the CDC will have something to announce to you in the next hour to two hours.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; President Biden, on overseas coronavirus vaccines: Should other high-income countries follow the lead of the United States and increase donations to low- and middle-income countries?&nbsp;<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; I think those countries that have been able to cover their population and have the ability to provide either dollars and/or vaccine for the 100 or so na- &#8212; poor nations that need help should do so.&nbsp; We had that discussion at the G7.&nbsp; A number of those countries said they were going to do that.&nbsp; Some have followed through.&nbsp;<br><br>The point I was making is, though, I&#8217;ve kept the commitment &#8212; we&#8217;ve kept the commitment that we would do what we said, which is more than all the rest of the countries combined thus far.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. President, do you believe that Governor DeSantis and Governor Abbott are personally making decisions that are harming their own citizens?<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; I believe the results of their decisions are not good for their constituents.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s clear to me and to most of the medical experts that the decisions being made, like not allowing mask mandates in school and the like, are bad health policy &#8212; bad health policy.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. President, I have a question about something that you just said.<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; I&#8217;m sure you do.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; You just said there is no wall high enough and no ocean wide enough to protect us from the virus.&nbsp; So what is the thinking behind letting untested and unvaccinated migrants cross the southern border into U.S. cities in record numbers?<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; There is &#8212; what we&#8217;re doing &#8212; we have not withdrawn the order that is sometimes critical &#8212; criticized &#8212; saying that unvaccinated people should be &#8212; go back across the border.&nbsp;<br><br>But unaccompanied children is a different story, because there&#8217;s &#8212; that&#8217;s the most humane thing to do is to test them and to treat them and not send them back alone.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. President, have you spoken with Governor Cuomo today?<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; I have not.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then one other question on the virus.&nbsp; You just said we have &#8212; we have to continue our aggressive efforts to get the unvaccinated vaccinated.&nbsp; Other countries have found a lot of success in requiring vaccines in public places.&nbsp; New York City just announced today that they’ll require vaccines for restaurants and gyms.&nbsp; Do you think more cities and states should institute rules like that?<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; I do.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And are you going to publicly call on them?&nbsp; Should they institute a vaccine passport-type system, or it&#8217;s up to each city and state to figure that out on their own?<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; I&#8217;m sorry.&nbsp; What did you say?<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you think that they should institute a vaccine passport-type system or some sort of verification to use public spaces?<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t think they need to do that.&nbsp; I think they just need to give the authority of those restaurants or businesses to say, “In order to come in, you have to give proof that you&#8217;ve been vaccinated or you can&#8217;t come in.”<br><br>I’ll take a couple more.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. President can I ask you about news of the day &#8212; one more on Governor Cuomo?&nbsp; You&#8217;re calling for him to resign now.&nbsp; My question is: Do you think he should be prosecuted?&nbsp; And what is your message to the women who have now accused him of sexually harassing them and abusing them?<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Look, what I said was: If the investigation of the Attorney General concluded that the allegations were correct, that &#8212; back in March &#8212; that I would recommend he resign.&nbsp; That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m doing today.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve not read the report.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know the detail of it.&nbsp; All I know is the end result.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. President, a question on COVID, if I could, really quickly.&nbsp; It&#8217;s the eviction moratorium.&nbsp; Can you explain a little bit more why it took so long to have a possible eviction moratorium be put into place?&nbsp; There was &#8212; there are people &#8212; this expired on Saturday.&nbsp; I&#8217;m wondering &#8212; there are folks who are saying it took too long for this to happen.<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Well, look, the courts made it clear that the existing moratorium was not constitutional; it wouldn&#8217;t stand.&nbsp; And they made that clear back in, I guess, July 15th or July 18th.&nbsp;<br><br>In the meantime, what I&#8217;ve been pushing for and calling for is we have billions of dollars that were given to states to provide for rent and utilities for those people who can&#8217;t afford to stay in their homes because they can&#8217;t &#8212; an apartment &#8212; they can&#8217;t pay their rent.&nbsp; And so, we’re urging them to distribute those funds to the landlords.&nbsp; I believe that would take care of the vast majority of what needs to be done to keep people in their &#8212; in their ho- &#8212; in their apartments now.&nbsp;<br><br>And so that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re working on.&nbsp; Some states have done it and some communities have, but they have not.&nbsp; The money is there.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not &#8212; we don&#8217;t have to send it out.&nbsp; It&#8217;s been sent out to the states and counties &#8212; billions of dollars &#8212; for the express purpose of providing for back rent and rent for the people who are in the middle of this crisis.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s there; that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re pushing now.&nbsp; And we&#8217;ve been pushing that.&nbsp; That&#8217;s the immediate thing to do.<br><br>I’ll take one more question.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. President, thank you so much.&nbsp; There was an expectation that you would be announcing new vaccines to the world today &#8212; a new &#8212; other than the ones you promised.&nbsp; Are you ready to send more vaccines to the world?&nbsp;<br><br>And there is a delegation from the White House going to Brazil tomorrow.&nbsp; Are they bringing more vaccines?&nbsp; Are they announcing more vaccines to Brazil?<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; No &#8212; are they announcing more vaccines overall?<br><br>Q&nbsp; &nbsp; Overall.&nbsp; And then to Brazil &#8212; for the delegation coming to Brazil tomorrow &#8212; will you be bringing vaccines?<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; The answer is: I don&#8217;t know whether the delegation going physically has vaccines with them.&nbsp; We have provided vaccines to &#8212;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are they bringing the announcement?&nbsp; Are they announcing there?<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Well, no, there’s a need for several billion doses around the world.&nbsp; We have committed to over a half a billion doses.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re trying to provide for more and provide for the capacity of countries like India to be able to produce the vaccine themselves.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re helping them do that.&nbsp; That&#8217;s what we&#8217;re doing now.&nbsp;<br><br>And we&#8217;re trying to &#8212; we’re &#8212; and, by the way, it&#8217;s free.&nbsp; We&#8217;re not charging anybody anything.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re trying to do as much as we possibly can.&nbsp;<br><br>Thank you all very much.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. President, we’re learning that your administration is about to announce a new partial eviction moratorium, COVID related.&nbsp; Can you tell us any more about that?&nbsp; And are you sure it&#8217;s going to pass Supreme Court muster?</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; The answer is twofold.&nbsp; One, I’ve sought out constitutional scholars to determine what is the best possibility that would come from executive action, or the CDC’s judgment, what could they do that was most likely to pass muster, constitutionally.<br><br>The bulk of the constitutional scholarship says that it&#8217;s not likely to pass constitutional muster.&nbsp; Number one.&nbsp; But there are several key scholars who think that it may and it&#8217;s worth the effort.&nbsp; But the present &#8212; you could not &#8212; the Court has already ruled on the present eviction moratorium.&nbsp;<br><br>So I think what you&#8217;re going to see, and I &#8212; look, I want to make it clear: I told you I would not tell the Justice Department or the medical experts, the scientists what they should say or do.&nbsp; So I don&#8217;t want to get ahead.&nbsp;<br><br>The CDC has to make the &#8212; I asked the CDC to go back and consider other options that may be available to them.&nbsp; You&#8217;re going to hear from them what those other options are.<br><br>I have been informed they&#8217;re about to make a judgment as to potential other options.&nbsp; Whether that option will pass constitutional measure with this administration, I can&#8217;t tell you.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know.&nbsp; There are a few scholars who say it will and others who say it&#8217;s not likely to.&nbsp;<br><br>But, at a minimum, by the time it gets litigated, it will probably give some additional time while we&#8217;re getting that $45 billion out to people who are, in fact, behind in the rent and don&#8217;t have the money.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why it was passed in &#8212; in the act that we passed in the beginning of my administration, and it went to the states.&nbsp;<br><br>We were under the impression that the states were moving this money out relatively rapidly.&nbsp; So, for example, if I&#8217;m in an apartment &#8212; if you&#8217;re in an apartment, and you&#8217;re behind on four- or five-month’s rent, and let&#8217;s say your rent is $2,000 a month &#8212; I&#8217;m just making this up out of the blue &#8212; and you&#8217;re behind, you need $10,000 to catch up.&nbsp; Hardly anybody has that $10,000.&nbsp; But there is money that the states have that can give to the landlord that $10,000 to the back rent.&nbsp;<br><br>The future rent, it’s unlikely &#8212; at least the hope is, since they have been made whole to that point &#8212; that they&#8217;d be inclined &#8212; because the economy is growing &#8212; inclined not to throw someone out in the street; keep that person &#8212; no guarantee &#8212; keep that person in the apartment, keep these kids in the same school district, and count on being able to have the opportunity for that &#8212; that person to be able &#8212; who may now be employed &#8212; to pay their rent.<br><br>But in the meantime, I&#8217;ve asked, isn’t there any safety valve we can put in?&nbsp; And it&#8217;s the one I explained to you.&nbsp; Again, CDC will announce that and the details of exactly how it works.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not telling &#8212; I told them I want them to take a look.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t tell them what they had to do.&nbsp;<br><br>And my hope is, it’s going to be a new moratorium that in some way &#8212; and I&#8217;m not going to announce it now; I’ll let them announce it &#8212; in some way covers close to 90 percent of the American people who are renters.&nbsp; And so that&#8217;s all I can tell you now.<br><br>Thank you very much.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why not 100 percent?&nbsp; What&#8217;s the difference?<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Because it’s a &#8212; (laughs) &#8212; let them explain that to you.&nbsp; Okay?&nbsp; I don’t want to get too far ahead.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. President, is COVAX doing enough to get shots in arms?<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why not call Governor DeSantis, Mr. President?<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; (Laughs.)&nbsp; To say “happy birthday”?&nbsp; What?&nbsp; I mean &#8212;&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To deliver the message that you seem to be delivering today about “get out of the way.”<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; He knows the message.&nbsp; He knows the message.&nbsp; We had a little discussion when I was down there.&nbsp; He knows the message.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What did he say to you in that discussion?<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; (Laughs.)&nbsp; See you all later.<br><br>5:00 P.M. EDT</p>

<p>The deal reached by President Biden and the bipartisan group of Senators makes a once-in-a-generation investment in our infrastructure and will create good-paying union jobs repairing our roads and bridges, replacing lead pipes, and building energy transmission lines. It invests in clean energy manufacturing and zero-emission vehicles ensuring that the jobs in the clean energy industry are good-paying, quality American jobs. The deal ensures that all taxpayer-funded infrastructure projects use materials made in America.</p>



<p>The Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act will create good jobs for workers across the country, including workers in rural areas, hard-hit energy workers, historically disadvantaged workers, and workers in distressed areas. This historic investment will accelerate the economic recovery, put Americans back to work, and boost wages for workers across the country.</p>



<p>The legislation will:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Create millions of good-paying jobs.</strong>&nbsp;With the President’s Build Back Better agenda, the investments in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act will add, on average, around 2 million jobs per year over the course of the decade, accelerating America’s path to full employment while bringing workers who have been left behind into the labor force.<br>&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Protect critical labor standards on construction projects.&nbsp;</strong>The overwhelming majority of the funds in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act will be subject to Davis-Bacon requirements, which ensure that contractors pay workers on construction projects a fair, prevailing wage so that local wages, labor markets, and workers won’t be undercut. These requirements will protect wages for millions of workers, grow the economy, and support good-paying, union jobs.<br>&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Grow wages in the clean energy industry.</strong>&nbsp;President Biden committed to ensuring that the new jobs created in the clean energy industry—solar, wind, carbon capture, energy transmission—would be good-paying, union jobs. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act extends prevailing wage protections to all energy infrastructure provisions, including the construction of EV charging stations on highways and in communities, ensuring that these critical jobs come with good wages and benefits and support local unions.<br>&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Put pipefitters to work making communities safer.</strong>&nbsp;The Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act will put pipefitters to work across the country with an historic investment in our water infrastructure, including funding to replace all of the nation’s lead water pipes. It also invests $1 billion to modernize and repair natural gas distribution pipelines, creating good-paying jobs while fighting the climate crisis by reducing methane emissions, as well as making our communities safer.<br>&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Buy America.&nbsp;</strong>The Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act lives up to the President’s commitment to ensure that the future is made in America by American workers. The legislation includes a comprehensive Buy America provision to ensure that all taxpayer-funded infrastructure and public works projects are built with American iron, steel, manufactured products, and construction materials. This will create good-paying manufacturing jobs here at home and further the President’s commitment to revitalizing the domestic industrial base.<br>&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Protect and support transit workers</strong>. The agreement provides unprecedented support for transportation&nbsp;workers who have worked tirelessly on the frontlines of the pandemic. The legislation includes new provisions to prevent operator assaults built on collective bargaining and labor-management collaboration, so that no transit worker should fear for their safety just for doing their job. And it provides over $300 million in grant funding to train transit workers on the zero-emission vehicles of the future, including through registered apprenticeships and other joint labor-management training programs.<br>&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Support auto workers</strong>. Auto workers and good, union auto manufacturing jobs are the backbone of communities across the country. As the country transitions to zero-emission vehicles, the President committed to building those vehicles and their components here in the United States. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act invests in grants to support battery and battery component manufacturing, manufacturing facilities, and retooling and retrofitting of existing facilities. It also invests in good-paying jobs building a nationwide network of electric vehicle charging infrastructure along highway corridors, which will accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles to address the climate crisis and support domestic manufacturing jobs.<br>&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Invest in coal and energy communities</strong>. America’s coal miners and energy workers have powered this country for more than a century. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act invests in places impacted by shifting energy markets, including directing billions of dollars for advanced energy manufacturing facilities and clean energy demonstration projects to communities where coal mines or power plants have been shut down. The legislation also invests $21 billion in environmental remediation, creating good-paying union jobs in hard-hit energy communities cleaning up superfund and brownfield sites, reclaiming abandoned mines, and capping orphaned gas wells.</li></ul>



<p>The Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act is just one part of President Biden’s plan to create and support good-paying, union jobs and deliver workers the dignity and rights they are owed. The President’s Build Back Better plan will pair job creation efforts with workforce development programs, invest in child care and long-term care and the care workers that enable others to go to work, provide national paid family and medical leave, ensure federal agencies have the necessary resources to protect workers, and invest in other efforts to create good, union jobs.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">State Dining Room</p>



<p>1:42 P.M. EDT</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT: Okay. Well, everybody, welcome. Today, I have the privilege of meeting with Latino leaders to discuss a bunch of key issues that affect the community; the progress we’re making against the pandemic; historic and economic recovery we’re under- &#8212; that’s undergoing &#8212; we’re undergoing; and immigration and voting rights, which are critical.</p>



<p>Latino leaders have been essential to helping us get the country vaccinated, with 70 percent of all adult Americans receiving at least one shot.</p>



<p>The vaccines work. Even as cases go up due to the highly transmissionable [sic] &#8212; transmissible disease, the Delta variant, we’re not seeing a comparable rise in hospitalizations or deaths in most of the country because of the vaccinations. This is an epidemic of the unvaccinated &#8212; a pandemic of the unvaccinated.</p>



<p>But we need everyone to get vaccinated in this pandemic. And it’s critical to keeping the economy strong.</p>



<p>And in six months, we’re seeing the fastest job growth of any point in any administration in history from the beginning of their administration, and the fastest economic growth in nearly 40 years.</p>



<p>And we have an opportunity to make historic investments in infrastructure and in American families, and finally build an economy that deals everybody in.</p>



<p>I’ve been saying from the beginning when I announced that I’m tired of trickle down. It doesn’t work very well. But when you build from the bottom up and the middle out, everybody does well, including the wealthy. That’s what this is all about.</p>



<p>And so, creating millions of good-paying jobs in every community and &#8212; including Latino neighborhoods &#8212; delivering affordable child and &#8212; care and paid leave and universal pre-K, two years of community college.</p>



<p>You know, today marks, as we all know &#8212; no one knows this better than this community – a two-year &#8212; two years of &#8212; since the shooting in El Paso. And all of us have, in our personal lives, lost people unexpectedly. Most of us have. We know how devastating it is, particularly one that was born out of such hatred.</p>



<p>But you know, I did a piece &#8212; Jill and I did a piece for the El Paso Times, but I realized after it was published that I didn’t talk about an aspect that is really important: There were 236 people who were wounded. How are they doing? The trauma. The equivalent of post-traumatic stress that comes from these kinds of things. I &#8212; and the need for &#8212; and I hope we’ll &#8212; we can talk about it a little bit later as well &#8212; is the need for mental health services and a whole range of things that affect not only them but their families when they’ve survived.</p>



<p>But to the families who have lost loved ones, and I mean this from the bottom of my heart, Jill and send our love &#8212; as all of you do, I know.</p>



<p>But I know, you know, these anniversaries are &#8212; should be celebrated in a sense of recognize &#8212; so we see things don’t happen again. But, you know, they’re terrible for the victims and the survivors because it brings back everything like it happened the very moment ago. And I &#8212; it takes enormous courage for people to &#8212; to respond that way.</p>



<p>You know, and I know how hard these anniversaries are. As I said, no matter how much time has passed, it brings it all back like it happened that second.</p>



<p>The El Paso community &#8212; you know, they continue to show their courage and the resilience. But to all Americans, this tragedy reminds us of the unfinished work to heal &#8212; and I know I got criticized for running on it, but I really mean it &#8212; heal the soul of this country. We have to return to some decency and honor, and I just &#8212; anyway.</p>



<p>The gunman targeted people and the diversity of El Paso and our most deeply held American values. And, you know, we all act together to counter what is basically domestic terrorism, domestic violence, domestic extremism, and end the scourge of gun violence in America. We can’t end it, but we sure can make a big difference than what it is now. And so, I continue to do everything in my power to do that.</p>



<p>The most lethal terrorist threat to our homeland in recent years is domestic terrorism &#8212; domestic terrorism rooted in white supremacy. We’re going to have to stand united against this violence because it just spills over to all communities.</p>



<p>And my administration is carrying out the country’s first-ever comprehensive effort to tackle the threat of domestic terrorism &#8212; from reducing online radicalization to disrupting networks that inspire violence, and providing resources to communities to build up some resilience.</p>



<p>And I’m going to continue to fight this for more commonsense gun laws. And we’re going to continue to call on Congress to take action, which they’ve been reluctant to do.</p>



<p>That includes a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines like the one used in El Paso. The idea anybody needs, for a pistol and/or a rifle &#8212; anyone needs 10, 12, 20, 30, 100 rounds in a rifle is just &#8212; it just makes no sense at all. Zero. Doesn’t violate anybody’s Second Amendment rights to say, “You can’t do that.” But it just has to stop.</p>



<p>And that includes using my existing authority, which I have, to &#8212; from reining in “ghost guns” and &#8212; to investing in community policing and community violence intervention, to having &#8212; bringing in psychologists and social workers into the police forces to help.</p>



<p>And, you know, I look forward to hearing from this group about all of these issues and a lot more. And &#8212; but, with that, we’re going to discuss a wide range of issues, all of us here tonight &#8212; today. And I’m looking forward to it.</p>



<p>So, thank you all. Thank you, press, for being here.</p>



<p>Q Mr. President, should Andrew Cuomo resign, sir? Should Andrew Cuomo resign?</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.</p>



<p>Q Should Andrew Cuomo resign, sir?</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT: Wait &#8212; wait a second. Be quiet, please.</p>



<p>I’m going to be speaking on COVID at four o’clock this afternoon, and I’ll take questions on COVID and other issues after that.</p>



<p>Thank you.</p>



<p>Q Thank you, sir.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">James S. Brady Press Briefing Room</p>



<p>2:17 P.M. EDT<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Hi, everyone.&nbsp; I have a couple of items for all of you at the top.&nbsp; I wanted to take a moment to recognize the passing of Metropolitan Police Officer Gunther Hashida and Officer Kyle DeFreytag &#8212; two officers who bravely defended the Capitol, both during and after the insurrection on January 6th.&nbsp; Their deaths are a sad reminder of that shameful day in our country&#8217;s history and of the physical and mental scars left the officers who risked their lives to protect our Capitol and our democracy.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>We heard firsthand, last week, from tho- &#8212; from some of those who served on that day, and their testimony reaffirmed the incredible bravery they showed in the worst possible circumstances.&nbsp; Their passing also reminds us of the remarkable courage of the men and women in law enforcement who serve with honor and leave home each day not knowing what risk they may face but are determined to protect their communities.&nbsp; We&#8217;re indebted to their services, and our thoughts go out to the friends, family, and loved ones of the two officers.<br>&nbsp;<br>And we want to remind those who are struggling that help is available 24/7.&nbsp; Please reach out to the Suicide Prevention line &#8212; Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>I also wanted to mark that today is two years since the mass shooting in El Paso that killed 23 people in a terrible act of domestic terrorism.&nbsp; They targeted a city defined by its diversity and rich Hispanic heritage.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>This morning, the President published an op-ed in the El Paso Times sharing his and the First Lady&#8217;s condolences with the families who lost loved ones and the broader El Paso Community.&nbsp; And he wrote about how today is a somber reminder of the unfinished work to heal the soul of this nation and end the epidemic of gun violence that is taking lives and shattering communities.<br>&nbsp;<br>The President and Vice President are currently meeting, as you all know, with 12 Latino leaders in the State Dining Room.&nbsp; At the to- &#8212; and you heard the President speak at the top of the meeting, of course.&nbsp; During the meeting, the President will speak about the work we must do to counter domestic terrorism and the spread of hate-fueled violence in every form, and end the scourge of gun violence in America.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>They will also focus &#8212; they’ll also talk about the President&#8217;s Build Back Better agenda and how it will benefit Latinos throughout the country, our economic recovery, voting rights, and immigration.<br>&nbsp;<br>Also wanted to note that today we are marking Black Women’s Equal Pay Day, which marks how far into the year Black women working full time need to work to earn what their white non-Hispanic male counterparts earned in the previous year.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>It takes a Black woman nearly 20 months to earn what a white man made in one year for the same work.&nbsp; Black women manage a disproportionate share of caregiving responsibilities, which have dramatically increased due to the COVID-19 pandemic, meaning that they may have to work part-time or leave the work &#8212; labor force entirely.&nbsp; They also comprise a disproportionate share of low-wage workers in industries, such as caregiving, that lack adequate compensation and benefits.<br>&nbsp;<br>The Biden-Harris administration has taken several steps to increase opportunity for Black women and girls, their families, and their communities to thrive in the workplace and to be economically secure &#8212; from the American Rescue Plan to the executive order to advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility in the workforce and vetting racial equ- &#8212; equity across this administration&#8217;s response; to COVID-19 and the economic crisis; and prioritizing Black mental health.&nbsp; And we, of course, will continue our work.<br>&nbsp;<br>I think I&#8217;m almost done here.&nbsp; Finally, last thing here: As a part of our effort as the bipartisan infrastructure bill is working its way through the Senate, the President is quite focused on lifting up the benefits of the bill to the American people.&nbsp; So we&#8217;re going to highlight a different component each day, and we&#8217;ll also do that through our digital social channels as well.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So today I&#8217;m going to highlight the unprecedented investment of $80 billion in passenger and freight rail over five years.&nbsp; That&#8217;s a 500 percent increase over current services, and it represents the largest investment in passenger rail since the creation of Amtrak a half a century ago.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>This money will help us eliminate Amtrak’s maintenance backlog; bring world-class rail service to areas around the country, creating good-paying union jobs in the process; and it will help make American businesses compete, grow, and expand by making it easier and cheaper for them to get their products to customers.<br>&nbsp;<br>With that, Jonathan, kick us off.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.&nbsp; In March, President Biden said that New York Governor Andrew Cuomo should resign if the New York Attorney General&#8217;s investigation confirmed allegations of sexual harassment.&nbsp; Today, the investigation found that Cuomo engaged in unwanted groping and kissing of at least 11 women, including current and former state employees.&nbsp; Does the President believe Governor Cuomo should resign?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, the President just said that he&#8217;s going to speak to this later this afternoon and share his views, so I&#8217;m not going to get ahead of his &#8212; ahead of his comments he’ll make later.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have there been any conversations today between the governor&#8217;s office and anyone here at the White House?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; No, there have not.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And why even &#8212; why &#8212; why the delay?&nbsp; Why not have the &#8212; did the President watch the governor&#8217;s video earlier?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Again, the President will give his own reaction to, of course, the announcement this morning and give his own view later this afternoon.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay. &nbsp;Then we’ll move on to something else then.&nbsp; There was a shooting today, earlier, at &#8212; that caused the lockdown of the Pentagon.&nbsp; And in that same burst of violence, it appears that a law enforcement officer was stabbed to death.&nbsp; Has the White House been briefed on what happened?&nbsp; What can you share as to what occurred today?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We’re, of course, in close touch with Pentagon officials.&nbsp; My colleague, John Kirby, will be briefing at the Pentagon and sharing more details on their end.&nbsp; We don&#8217;t have additional details to share publicly, as the next of kin is still being notified.<br>&nbsp;<br>Go ahead.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; Does the White House have a message for the women who came forward with these accusations against the governor?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; The White House’s message, the President&#8217;s message, the Vice President&#8217;s message, my message is: All womens [sic] who have &#8212; who have lived through sexual &#8212; this type of &#8212; this type of experience, whether it is harassment or abuse or, in the worst case, assault, deserve to have their voices heard, deserve to be treated with respect and with dignity.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>I don&#8217;t know that anyone could have watched this morning and not found the allegations to be abhorrent.&nbsp; I know I certainly did.&nbsp; And, again, the President will speak to this later this afternoon.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; And staying in New York, but on COVID, if you will: New York announced today that indoor diners, people who go to gyms, entertainment venues are going to have to show some sort of proof of vaccination.&nbsp; Is that a move that this White House supports?&nbsp; And does this amount to a vaccine passport?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, we know and recognize, Cecilia, that different communities and states are going to take steps to protect the people living in their states and also incentivize, whether it&#8217;s through carrots or sticks, more people getting vaccinated.&nbsp; That is what is going to save lives, and that is what is going to bring an end to the pandemic.&nbsp; This is certainly an example of that.<br>&nbsp;<br>We are not issuing federal passports &#8212; vaccine passports from the federal government, but we do know that private sector entities and other localities will make their own decisions.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>What we see as our objective is to continue to make the vaccine as accessible and available, and close the disparities that we see among racial groups in New York &#8212; including in New York &#8212; to ensure that this is not a barrier for entry to different groups based on socioeconomic or other factors.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And just one really quick one on COVID.&nbsp; San Francisco is now offering supplemental Pfizer or Moderna shots to folks who had the J&amp;J vaccine.&nbsp; Is that something that this administration endorses?&nbsp; And might we see that coming from the<br>CDC?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; That&#8217;s not based on public health &#8212; current public health guidance provided by the CDC.&nbsp; That has not changed.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>We, again, know different localities will be making decisions, but that&#8217;s not reflective of current public health guidance.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Go ahead.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; Sticking with the same topic, Governor DeSantis, in Florida, is taking a very different approach than New York is.&nbsp; Florida just hit another record today of COVID cases, and yet he&#8217;s pushing back on local municipalities that are trying to impose new mask mandates and other means of keeping people protected.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Does the White House have any reaction to Governor DeSantis, and particularly to his point that this is just seasonal in Florida because people are hot so they&#8217;re staying indoors and transmitting the vaccine &#8212; the virus.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, the data just doesn&#8217;t back that up.&nbsp; I would say, first, Florida is not the only state; seven states have both a statewide ban on mask mandates and a prohibition on school districts from requiring masks in schools.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And some states have even banned businesses and universities from requiring workers and students to be vaccinated.&nbsp; In fact, the most extreme of these measures is in Texas where you can be fined &#8212; a professor or teacher can be fined if they ask a student if they are vaccinated or if they ask unvaccinated students to wear masks.<br>&nbsp;<br>And I think the fundamental question we have is: What are we doing here?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And the President &#8212; you&#8217;ll hear the President talk a little bit about this later this afternoon.&nbsp; His message is going to be: We&#8217;re all in this fight together, whether it&#8217;s Democratic or Republican governor.&nbsp; And I will note, most Republican governors are doing exactly the right thing and doing &#8212; and advocating for &#8212; and taking steps to advocate for more people to get vaccinated.<br>&nbsp;<br>But if you aren&#8217;t going to help, if you aren&#8217;t going to abide by public health guidance, then get out of the way and let people do the right thing to lead in their communities, whether they are teachers, university leaders, private sector leaders, or others who are trying to save lives.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And beyond sending messages like the President will do later today, what is the administration doing to actually communicate or work directly with some of these state officials?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; Well, I would first say that we are continuing to send surge teams out and we are in touch with a range of states and leaders in those states about how we can provide assistance that&#8217;s going to help them directly.&nbsp; So let me give you an example &#8212; or a couple of examples, I should say &#8212; of some of the states that have been hardest hit.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>We&#8217;ve actively been engaged with the governor&#8217;s office in Florida to describe and offer federal support in areas like testing; increasing vaccine confidence; monitoring hospital capacity, which we&#8217;ve seen the Florida Hospital Association speak &#8212; speak to their concerns about the rising numbers; and monoclonal antibody therapeutics.&nbsp; Teams from CDC and HHS are in contact with Florida officials to offer technical assistance and support.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>We&#8217;re also engaged with the governor&#8217;s office in Texas and the state health department to discuss the state of the pandemic there and how we can offer specific assistance, as well as Louisiana.&nbsp; I mean, you saw the governor make an announcement about masks yesterday.&nbsp; But as a part of our National Disaster Medical System program, we&#8217;ve deployed a team of 33 medical personnel to provide medical staff surge capacity to the Baton Rouge, Louisiana, area.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So those are just a couple of examples of some of the hardest-hit states.&nbsp; But we, again &#8212; Jeff Zients, our COVID coordinator, sent out a letter to all 50 governors, offering federal assistance, offering assistance, and offering to work in close touch about how we can help address the needs they have.<br>&nbsp;<br>Go ahead.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah, just quickly: You keep using the word “offer,” and I just want to know whether those offers have been accepted in Florida and Texas.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Right now, it&#8217;s a discussion, and we are talking about what their needs are and how we could help meet their needs.&nbsp; Louisiana, of course, has a &#8212; has &#8212; we have sent out and deployed this &#8212; this Disaster Medical Assistance Team of 33 medical personnel.&nbsp; But ideally, we will come to agreement on how we can provide additional assistance to help address parts of the country where there are rising case numbers.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go ahead.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The President has ruled out additional shutdowns related to COVID-19.&nbsp; And I&#8217;m just curious because that was an intervention that was used successfully to help places like New York City when they had hospital capacity issues.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Now we see hospitalization rates at their highest level since February.&nbsp; Why would you, why would the White House, why would the President rule that out?&nbsp; And is that consistent with your commitment to be led by science rather than politics?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would say it’s not just the President.&nbsp; One, he continues to be guided by science.&nbsp; Dr. Fauci and Dr. Collins also made similar comments this weekend.&nbsp; And the larger point they were making is we&#8217;re in a very different place now than we were last January.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>A, the Delta variant is the most transmissible.&nbsp; We are seeing rising case numbers in a specific &#8212; about a handful of states &#8212; about half a dozen states across the country.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>I will note, since we were just talking about Florida &#8212; and this statistic really struck me, so let me share it with all of you, if I can find it here.&nbsp; One second.&nbsp; Sorry.&nbsp; That approximately 50,000 of the &#8212; 50 percent of the 50,000 hospitalizations in the country came from just four states, with Florida being nearly a quarter of those.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So that&#8217;s relevant because what we&#8217;re seeing is rises in a set number of states.&nbsp; That&#8217;s one of the reasons why this surge capacity could certainly help in specific states and communities where they need help.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>What the &#8212; what we have ruled out is a across-the-board federal vaccine mandate.&nbsp; We are now at a point where more than 165 million people are fully vaccinated.&nbsp; Seventy percent of adults have gotten at least one shot.&nbsp; That is a different place than we were six months ago.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So I think that is a reflection of the science and medical experts conveying we&#8217;ve made enough progress.&nbsp; That&#8217;s not a &#8212; not a step they believe we would need from a public health perspective.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And there was an announcement yesterday about the continuation of Title 42 with regard to migrants and the public health situation at the border.&nbsp; Is there data showing that migrants are showing up with more COVID-positive rates?&nbsp; And is that what&#8217;s kind of led to that policy?&nbsp; Because we still have other people who are coming into the country by other means and we haven’t seen fit to prevent them from entering.&nbsp; So, why this treatment specifically for migrants?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would certainly point you to the CDC.&nbsp; They, of course, make the decisions and recommendations about maintaining Title 42 and keeping it in place.&nbsp; It&#8217;s rooted in preventing the introduction of contagious diseases into the interior of the United States.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>We certainly do, as we talked about yesterday, have specific protocols as it relates to unaccompanied children and also as it relates to, you know, even adults who come to our border.&nbsp; But they have not made a decision to lift Title 42 because they feel there&#8217;s an ongoing threat.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Just one more issue.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve heard a lot of, kind of, anecdotal reports about U.S. businesses that are struggling in terms of their trade relations in China, their ability to do business in China.&nbsp; And I just wanted to see if you had a status update on the review that the administration has been doing since your earliest days about &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; On tariffs?<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On tariffs, on trade policy toward China.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I do not have an update for you.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t believe there is one.&nbsp; It&#8217;s ongoing.&nbsp; But I will check and see, Trevor, if there’s anything to report to you.<br>&nbsp;<br>Go ahead, Kelly.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Typically you need the governor of a state to welcome in federal resources.&nbsp; Are there other ways where the White House or the administration could surge to Florida using military bases or federal property or something else that would not require an invitation from the governor?&nbsp; Is that part of the discussion?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; That&#8217;s a really good question.&nbsp; We work &#8212; beyond governors, who we certainly work with &#8212; Democrats and Republicans &#8212; we also work with local public health officials and authorities.&nbsp; There is a variety of kinds of assistance we can provide, whether it is medical advice or guidance on operational capacity and approaches &#8212; certainly something we can do with localities.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Businesses have also taken steps, and we&#8217;ve also &#8212; we stay attuned with that and stay in touch with them about the best steps that we can take.&nbsp; I would have to check and see.&nbsp; I think you&#8217;re referring to the requ- &#8212; you know, acceptance or request of FEMA assistance, which I don&#8217;t believe these surge teams are under FEMA.&nbsp; But I can check and see on that question.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Would the administration support, in areas where hospitals find that they&#8217;re overloaded, making any medical decision based on vaccination status or insurers deciding about paying medical bills based on vaccination status?&nbsp; Are we going to reach that point?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I would have to talk to our health team, but I&#8217;m not aware of that being under discussion.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Go ahead.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, following up on that rule in New York now where the mayor says if you&#8217;re not vaccinated, you can&#8217;t go to an indoor restaurant, a gym, or a show.&nbsp; Does the White House think that that is fair to people who may have a religious reason for not wanting the vaccine or who might just be waiting for the FDA to approve it fully before they get it?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; The administration and the White House and the President support steps by localities to take steps to protect people in their states and their communities to incentivize people getting vaccinated.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know all the specific details, if they have exemptions, so I&#8217;d point you to them.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; And then, I know that the President is going to speak a little bit about his thoughts on this Attorney General report in New York.&nbsp; In February, he invited Governor Cuomo to the White House for the next governor&#8217;s conference.&nbsp; Does that invitation still stand?</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I think I&#8217;ll let the President speak to his views later this afternoon.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; And then, the Justice Department recently dropped its civil rights investigation into Governor Cuomo’s handling of the COVID nursing home deaths.&nbsp; Does the administration want the Justice Department to initiate a civil rights investigation into these harassment allegations revealed today?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We do something new here that feels foreign from the last four years and allow the Justice Department to act independently on investigations.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; And then the New York Attorney General says, about the Cuomo accusers, “I believe them.”&nbsp; Does the President believe them?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Again, the President is going to speak to this later this afternoon, so I will point to &#8212; to his comments and I&#8217;m sure you will all be tuning in.&nbsp; He also said he&#8217;d take some questions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go ahead.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; The Senate Majority Leader, Chuck Schumer, said today that the Senate should expect to stay in session until the infrastructure bill is done.&nbsp; Is it still your expectation that the President will travel to Rehoboth at the end of the week, even if the Senate is still in session?</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; The President&#8217;s travel has not changed.&nbsp; But as you have seen the President do over the last several weeks and months, he is ready and &#8212; ready to be called into action, whether it&#8217;s a phone call or bringing people to the White House or to meet in the Oval Office, and that remains the case as we work to get this infrastructure bill across the finish line.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to ask you a question about yesterday&#8217;s news about the eviction moratorium.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Mm-hmm.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gene Sperling said yesterday, several times, that the President would do everything in his power to help people who face eviction.&nbsp; One power the President has in the Constitution is to convene a House of Congress if it&#8217;s not in session.&nbsp; Is that something the President would consider &#8212; bringing the House back?&nbsp; It’s out for seven weeks while this issue is lingering and the White House has already asked Congress to act.&nbsp; Why not do what Harry Truman did in 1948: bring the Congress back and say, “You can&#8217;t go on vacation until this issue is resolved”?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I think the key here is you need the votes in order to support a piece of legislation passing.&nbsp; I am not a vote counter, but I would point you to the Lead- &#8212; the Speaker&#8217;s office to see if that exists.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>But I will say what the President was referring to is his ask over the weekend of the CDC to look into any legal authority, any option they have &#8212; perhaps a narrower approach, perhaps a short-term extension.&nbsp; This was never meant to be permanent, as we know.&nbsp; That&#8217;s what you need legislation for.&nbsp; And to see what is possible.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They are continuing to do that.&nbsp; I will certainly leave it to them to make any announcements about what they have found.<br>&nbsp;<br>I will note that one of the steps that he has really pressed his policy team on, that Gene spoke to yesterday, are the states getting this money out into their communities because there is enough money out there for states across the country to extend the eviction moratorium from a state level, even without federal action.<br>&nbsp;<br>We&#8217;ve seen Texas provide over $300 million in rental and utility assistance in June alone and has distributed most of the assistance.&nbsp; That&#8217;s a positive step forward.<br>&nbsp;<br>Virginia has distributed the second-most assistance and has implemented efforts to address incomplete applications with outreach phone calls.<br>&nbsp;<br>Illinois did not report making any assistance payments between January and May, but delivered over $95 million in utility and rental assistance in June alone.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So, I use this as an example because there&#8217;s a great deal &#8212; tens of billions of dollars &#8212; that can still be spent by states.&nbsp; It is too slow.&nbsp; We made some progress in June, but we&#8217;re really pressing states to get this money out and to extend the eviction moratorium from a state level.<br>&nbsp;<br>Go ahead.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a couple on eviction, but, to start with, you mentioned the MPD officers who tragically passed away.&nbsp; The Senate just cleared a bill giving Congressional Gold Medals to everybody who responded on January 6th.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Mm-hmm.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the President signs that, are you guys considering inviting any of the officers to the White House?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; It is a great question.&nbsp; I have not talked to the President about that specifically, but let me see if we can get more information on that this afternoon.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; And then, two quick ones on eviction.&nbsp; I’m mercifully not a lawyer &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Me neither.&nbsp; There may be some in here.&nbsp; I don’t know.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Very disappointing to my parents.&nbsp; But the &#8212; in terms of the legal analysis, based on where &#8212; I understand what you guys are saying on what Kavanaugh put in his opinion, but that does not change the fact that, as it currently stands, the President can extend if he wants to.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And so, I guess, my question, from a legal basis is: Is the advice that Dana and the Justice Department are giving based on the fact of being concerned more about having the CDC’s emergency powers reduced if you go down this pathway, or is it because &#8212; I guess I&#8217;ll just stop there.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; I am mercifully not a lawyer, either.&nbsp; I would say we&#8217;re both doing okay to our parents, hopefully.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>But I will tell you that &#8212; from a legal standpoint, I would note that, in June &#8212; at the end of June, the Supreme Court came out and they &#8212; they put a stay on the moratorium and made clear in their public writing, as Gene referenced yesterday, which is available to everybody, that any further action would need legislative steps forward.<br>&nbsp;<br>We also indicated, as a result, that the third extension of the moratorium that the CDC has &#8212; did since January would be the last extension.<br>&nbsp;<br>In addition, there are concerns about what the impact could be on the long-term capacity abilities &#8212; authorities, I should say, of the CDC.&nbsp; Their team is looking closely, carefully &#8212; their legal team &#8212; has been since the President asked them to on Sunday at what our options are here.&nbsp; That was a broad federal moratorium.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>There had been good questions raised about whether it can be more limited.&nbsp; That was in our statement yesterday, especially given the rise of the Delta variant, which we&#8217;ve seen and has really raised concerns for everybody &#8212; us, from members of Congress, from many advocates over the past several weeks.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So, they are taking a close look at that or they have been taking close look at that.&nbsp; But there is &#8212; there&#8217;s been a range of legal factors, and they&#8217;re taking a &#8212; they&#8217;re kicking the tires.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; And then, just one more to follow up on that.&nbsp; Speaker Pelosi’s statement after your statement yesterday made pretty clear the enthusiasm was based on the fact you guys are still looking for legal options &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yep.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; which Gene was pretty clear last night the tires that have been kicked up to that point had presented none of them.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>I guess, my question is: I don’t understand how this ends.&nbsp; You made very clear the reality: There&#8217;s no votes on Capitol Hill.&nbsp; This is a huge issue inside the House Democratic Caucus, and you guys don&#8217;t think you have the legal authority.&nbsp; How does this end?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We do hard things.&nbsp; It&#8217;s challenging.<br>&nbsp;<br>I will say there are a couple of options here.&nbsp; We are still continuing to look at legal options.&nbsp; That process has not concluded.<br>&nbsp;<br>And again, I would note that, in our statement yesterday, we made clear that the President even raised the question of a partial, limited, short-term extension.&nbsp; This was never going to be permanent, right?&nbsp; It was never intended to be.<br>&nbsp;<br>The other piece, which I touched on briefly in response to Steve&#8217;s &#8212; or I think it was Steve’s question &#8212; was related to what states can do.&nbsp; And there&#8217;s no question that there’s a great deal of funding that has not gone out nearly as quickly as it should have gone out.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>We recognize that issue.&nbsp; We are quite focused on that issue.&nbsp; And one of the efforts that we feel we do have some control over is pushing states to extend moratoriums in their own states.&nbsp; They have the funding to do it.&nbsp; The funding comes from the American Rescue Plan.&nbsp; They need to get it out the door.&nbsp; That should help keep many people in their homes.<br>&nbsp;<br>So, we are &#8212; we are continuing to work on several tracks on this front.&nbsp; The President wants to keep people in their homes.&nbsp; He does not want people to be out on the street, and he&#8217;s going to do everything in his power, even with the challenges you outlined, to get that done.<br>&nbsp;<br>Go ahead.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not going to use the phrase “kicking the tires” &#8212; although, I just did.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; You can &#8212; you just used it.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I did.&nbsp; (Laughter.)<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We can keep it as a theme.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Foiled again.&nbsp; Okay.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Lifting the hood.&nbsp; Whatever you say.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There you go.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Should we expect anything from the President later in terms of a partial, limited, short-term extension?&nbsp; Is he going to give an update on anything related to evictions at 4:00?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I would say that any announcement &#8212; any decision and announcement would be made by the CDC.&nbsp; And then, if &#8212; if they find there is capacity or steps they can &#8212; that they can take from a legal standpoint, I&#8217;m sure this President would speak to it.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; And there was a report yesterday in Politico that a senior aide in this White House has been abusive to other colleagues.&nbsp; I know the report was based on anonymous sourcing, but &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; You know how I love anonymous sources &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That’s why I almost didn’t ask because I feel like you would just say &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; &#8212; placing criticism.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right.&nbsp; But, I’m wondering if, given this administration has its edict to treating people with kindness and respect, is this report, even though anonymously sourced, going to be looked into?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; First, I would say that I&#8217;ve worked with now, over the last six months, even as a newbie into the Biden orbit, the individual named by anonymous source.&nbsp; He&#8217;s been nothing but supportive and communicative, and that&#8217;s been my experience.<br>&nbsp;<br>You know, it&#8217;s hard to look into “anonymously sourced reports.”&nbsp; I&#8217;m not aware of that being the intention.<br>&nbsp;<br>Go ahead.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; In July, we likely saw a record &#8212; a record high of unaccompanied children &#8212; again, a monthly high &#8212; arriving at the southern border.&nbsp; And we&#8217;ve already reached a yearly high of migrants who’ve arrived at the border.&nbsp; You all have previously explained this was likely due to a seasonal spike that we&#8217;ve seen, but we&#8217;re well out of what we would normally see on a yearly average.&nbsp; What is your current assessment for why we&#8217;re seeing these numbers still well into a very hot summer?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We&#8217;ve &#8212; we’ve said that was one of the factors, and it is typically one of the factors seasonally.&nbsp; We saw a big uptick in the spring, which you see every other year or so.&nbsp; You know, I will say there&#8217;s a range of factors, which are happening in these countries where individuals are leaving from &#8212; economic challenges, weather challenges, crime &#8212; and that is&nbsp;&#8212; those are also, of course, drivers of people of all ages trying to leave their country to come to the United States.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>That&#8217;s one of the reasons the Vice President has been so focused, at the President&#8217;s asking, on addressing these root causes.&nbsp; That&#8217;s a long-term &#8212; a long-term challenge and a long &#8212; will require a long-term solution.&nbsp; She laid out some significant steps forward last week, and that is going to continue to be something she is working on.<br>&nbsp;<br>But I will note that, you know, even &#8212; even with the uptick we&#8217;ve seen over the last several months, as we&#8217;ve noted, Title 42 remains in place for health reasons.&nbsp; We also have made great progress in moving people through Border Patrol facilities &#8212; especially, of course, children &#8212; and getting them into places where they can be treated with safety, safely.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, one other question.&nbsp; The Senate Homeland Security Committee released a report this morning that found serious cybersecurity vulnerabilities all across the federal government.&nbsp; The average rating they gave was C-minus.&nbsp; It was &#8212; a lot of work &#8212; a lot of different agencies got B&#8217;s.&nbsp; Does the White House agree with that assessment?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And then, is &#8212; as Senator Portman stressed, are you all willing to take some of the considerations or recommendations that they put in the report into account?&nbsp; For instance, creating a coordinating body or just requiring more stringent cybersecurity regulations around &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I have not taken a look at the report nor &#8212; and I&#8217;m not aware if our team has or not, but I&#8217;m happy to see if they have a reaction to it.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Why don&#8217;t I go to the back just so I can jump around.&nbsp; Go ahead.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.&nbsp; I wanted to follow up on the question of lockdowns from a second ago because, you know, yesterday, you said that we are not going back to the shutdowns of March 2020.&nbsp; You also said that, quote, “We&#8217;re not going to take options off the table.”&nbsp; Given how incredibly effective the vaccine is, why not take lockdowns off the table?<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I think I also said that that’s not under consideration.&nbsp; That hasn&#8217;t changed.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you for clarifying.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Okay, go ahead.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes. &nbsp;Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; The administration today announced its allocation plan for the first 25 million COVID-19 vaccine doses to be shared globally.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Mm-hmm.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#8217;ve asked this before in a different forum but &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Okay.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; what is the guidance the administration has for the as many as 9 million American citizens overseas that are still waiting for a vaccine dose?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I know you’ve asked this before, and it is incumbent and upon us to get you a good answer.&nbsp; Obviously, our embassies are fully in touch with American citizens who are living overseas, but it&#8217;s probably best suited for the State Department to answer that question, given they oversee all of our diplomatic efforts.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Go ahead.&nbsp; Oh, go ahead.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You said that &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; (Inaudible) your tie looks good though.&nbsp; (Laughs.)<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; You’ve said that the administration supports New York City or locality steps to, you know, do what they need to to keep their residents safe.&nbsp; Given the success that foreign countries have had in mandating vaccines &#8212; obviously, New York is taking this step &#8212; has there been any more discussion inside the White House about encouraging &#8212; actively encouraging city and states to take steps like New York did today?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We work very closely with governors and localities about what steps they&#8217;re considering and what steps are appropriate to help protect people in their localities and save more lives.&nbsp; But I don&#8217;t have anything &#8212; any additional considerations to preview for you.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So the President is not going to weigh in one way or the other whether he supports mandating vaccines in the way that, you know, other countries have?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We support steps by private sector entities.&nbsp; We support steps by localities to save lives, protect their communities, incentivize more people getting vaccinated.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then just one more on the eviction moratoriums.&nbsp; Does the President have any plans to speak with Representative Bush or any of the other lawmakers that are outside the Capitol?&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that the Representative spoke with the Vice President yesterday as she was in the Capitol, but does the President have any plans to speak with her?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have any plans to preview for you.&nbsp; I &#8212; as you noted, the Vice President was leaving the Capitol yesterday, and she spoke briefly with Representative Bush.&nbsp; We are in regular touch with a range of members of the Progressive Caucus on a number of issues, including, of course, this important issue.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>We were in la- &#8212; late last week, into the weekend, and yesterday, White House officials were in touch with Speaker Pelosi, various members, including Representatives Cori Bush, as I noted; Representative Jayapal; Gomez; Pressley; and the CPC Executive Director.<br>&nbsp;<br>And Representative Bush certainly shared firsthand her firsthand account of being evicted, and explained what this meant to her, which is something that stuck with the people she spoke with.<br>&nbsp;<br>So we will remain in close touch.&nbsp; That will continue.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have a call to preview for you at this point in time.<br>&nbsp;<br>Go ahead.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.&nbsp; The White House has stressed that it&#8217;s following the health and the science when it comes to COVID-19, and that has been the basis for the ongoing international travel restrictions.&nbsp; But what is the health or scientific basis for the travel restrictions on vaccinated individuals from Europe or Canada or other nations, when people who are unvaccinated from other countries are allowed to come into the United States?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I would certainly point you to our health and medical teams who make these decisions and evaluate what we need to do, from a public health perspective, to keep the American people safe at a time where the Delta variant is rising, and one where we are very cognizant about keeping the American people safe.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And a quick follow-up on that.&nbsp; When it comes to countries that have more vaccinated individuals than the United States does at this point as a percentage of population, what is the basis for those restrictions?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Again, I would point you to our public health officials who are leading this effort and determining when we can raise or end those restrictions.&nbsp; I certainly understand there&#8217;s a desire to do that by many people in the United States, many people around the world.&nbsp; We understand that.&nbsp; I just don&#8217;t have an update on it and when that will happen.<br>&nbsp;<br>Go ahead.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; It was just a little over a month ago that the President traveled down to Surfside.&nbsp; He actually sat side by side with Governor DeSantis.&nbsp; They both praised one another for their respective handling of the disaster situation there.&nbsp; I&#8217;m wondering if there has been any further direct communication between the President and the governor.&nbsp; And might the President consider speaking with the governor specifically about what we&#8217;re seeing in terms of the rise in the hospitalizations and this developing situation with COVID down there?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, if it &#8212; we thought it would make a difference, I&#8217;m sure he would.&nbsp; But I would say that the President feels you can praise leaders for taking some steps &#8212; as he did in that scenario with that tragedy at Surfside where many people&#8217;s lives were lost, many families were suffering &#8212; while at the same time expressing concern about their handling of a pandemic, which is what we&#8217;re doing in this regard.<br>&nbsp;<br>But I don&#8217;t have any expectation or prediction of a call between them.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He hasn’t shied away from calling out, for instance, social media companies for their roles in the spread of disinformation, for instance.&nbsp; Does he feel that Governor DeSantis bears responsibility for a situation with regard to hospitalizations that is an outlier compared to the rest of the country?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I think you&#8217;ll hear him talk this afternoon about where he&#8217;s seeing the biggest challenges in the country.&nbsp; But I think any call we make, we do through the prism of what we think is going to result in action and result in a positive outcome.&nbsp; And their calling out social media companies and the fact that they can take additional steps is one thing, but we certainly are still open to working with governors of all political stripes to help address the pandemic.&nbsp; And our objective and our hope would be to work in partnership and not get into a food fight.<br>&nbsp;<br>Go ahead.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Oh, go ahead.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You want to go ahead?&nbsp; And then I’ll go.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Yeah, that&#8217;s fine.&nbsp; Go ahead.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All right.&nbsp; There&#8217;s been a second incident involving oil tankers off the Gulf of Oman today.&nbsp; Fingers pointed to Iran.&nbsp; Do you believe that Iran is threatening international shipping line?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And today, Iran has &#8212; the new president has taken office.&nbsp; Do you think that the White House can work with the hardliners, especially that we still don&#8217;t know if you guys are going to go to the seventh round of talks in Vienna?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; Well, first, we&#8217;re monitoring this developing situation, and we are in close touch with London and other partners who &#8212; around the world who are also monitoring.&nbsp; The first reports are deeply concerning.&nbsp; We are fully engaged, and will be, as the situation is developing.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>I would say that, as it relates to whether we can work with &#8212; I think our view, as I mentioned yesterday, is that every single challenge and threat we face from Iran would be made more pronounced and dangerous by an unconstrained nuclear program that continues. &nbsp;We would not anticipate that would solve every concern we have about their behavior in the world, but we believe that having greater visibility into their nuclear capacity and capabilities would be in our national interest, in the interests of many of our partners. &nbsp;And certainly, we would hope we could build from there. &nbsp;But, you know, we are fully prepared to return to Vienna to continue negotiations and hope that is the &#8212; there&#8217;s an opportunity to do that.<br>&nbsp;<br>Go ahead.&nbsp; I&#8217;m going to the two ladies behind you.&nbsp; Go ahead.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to ask about the infrastructure bill &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; specifically the Reconnecting Communities Program that’s in there.&nbsp; The President asked for at least $20 billion &#8212; with a “B” &#8212; in the American Jobs Plan, and the bill has it at $1 billion.&nbsp; I wanted to ask if that&#8217;s enough to do what you want with the program or reach the program&#8217;s goals, and if you&#8217;re going to pursue funding for it through another path.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah, well, I would first say that major project funding can be used for these kinds of efforts, which are certainly a priority to the President.&nbsp; And this is the first time in American history that the federal government has taken on the effects of the 20th century practice of placing roads or other infrastructure in ways that deliberately interrupt the hearts of Black communities, like what happened in New Orleans, Syracuse, and cities across the country.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So, we are &#8212; certainly I know the President proposed a greater amount of money; part of coming to an agreement is compromise.&nbsp; But we also believe that project funding for other projects that&#8217;s a part of this package could be used to address, you know, the division of communities and further our equity objectives.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So would you then &#8212; and some of the programs are grant funding or something &#8212; would you prioritize reconnecting communities to be able to use that funding for the purpose that you wanted?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, that&#8217;s &#8212; we&#8217;re kind of not at that point right now.&nbsp; But I certainly think there is room for funds from project funding that is included in this package to help address this key priority of the President&#8217;s.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Go ahead, Shelby.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; So, I wanted to ask about the New York City proof of vaccination.&nbsp; So, New York City data shows that the rate for Black New Yorkers is sitting at 31 percent, which is a lot lower than some of the other percentages.&nbsp; And this is similar to the national level, according to CDC data.&nbsp; So is the White House concerned at all that the burdens imposed by governments and businesses, like this New York City proof of vaccination, is going to fall heaviest on these minority communities?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would say, Shelby, that it&#8217;s our objective to continue to close that equity gap and to make sure we are, as a federal government, working in partnership with city &#8212; or states like New York, cities like New York City, to make sure we are making the vaccine accessible, available; we&#8217;re meeting people where they are; we&#8217;re partnering with the right public health officials.&nbsp; And we will continue to do exactly that, because we certainly don&#8217;t want this to be a barrier of entry for communities.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>We also believe that at a time where the Delta variant is spreading like wildfire across the country, especially to unvaccinated communities, that it&#8217;s important and country &#8212; cities and communities should be able to take steps to incentivize, get more people getting vaccinated.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Go ahead.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a question on the eviction moratorium.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some states are reporting a lot of logistical problems in dispersing their funds, from websites getting overloaded and crashing to renters not being able to track down all the verification documents.&nbsp; What is this administration doing or what can it do to make the process easier, streamline it, less difficult &#8212; make it easier for the states to disperse the funds?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah, look, I would say, as Gene touched on yesterday, there is &#8212; long before this question about extending the eviction moratorium during a pandemic, there have been a lot of challenges and issues with our infrastructure as it relates to rental and housing assistance across the country.&nbsp; And this is really bringing that to light.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>What we have tried to do is work with states in partnership to share best practices.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve hosted two summits with 46 of the cities with most tenants at risk to help jurisdictions set up these new eviction prevention programs.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>We also have a range of experts and officials in the federal government who are here to provide assistance and guidance on how this money can get out.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve seen some progress over the last month; obviously, more needs to be done.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>But we are here.&nbsp; We are available.&nbsp; We are ready to provide assistance, to provide guidance to states and localities that need that.&nbsp; We want to work in partnership.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Go ahead, in the back.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, can you first tell us: Is there any progress on finding an ambassador to the Holy See?&nbsp; And if so, what qualifications are you looking for?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;I don&#8217;t have anything to preview for you at this point in time.&nbsp; I understand there&#8217;s still an ongoing interest in ambassadors.&nbsp; I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;ll be more to come very soon, if not &#8212; if not later today.&nbsp; We&#8217;ll see.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Go ahead, in the back.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, I mean, it feels like we&#8217;re dancing around an issue here, which is: How much are Governors DeSantis and Abbott directly responsible for what&#8217;s happening right now, given that 50 million people live in those two states that are &#8212; I think Jeff said yesterday &#8212; one third of all infections last week were there?&nbsp; So, how much personal responsibility do they bear?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I&#8217;m certainly not trying to dance in any way.&nbsp; I think what I said yesterday was that at a point in every leader’s life, they have to make a decision about whether they&#8217;re going to abide by public health guidelines to save people&#8217;s lives or whether we&#8217;re going to be guided by politics.&nbsp; And I will let you all be the judge of that.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Public health guidelines are pretty clear as it relates to the benefit of vaccination, as it relates to the benefit of masking for communities that are not vaccinated.&nbsp; And you&#8217;ll hear the President convey later: If you are not going to be a part of the solution, if you&#8217;re not going to be a part of saving people&#8217;s lives, then get out of the way and let other people do the job.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What do you mean by “Get out of the way”?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; That means don&#8217;t ban, don&#8217;t make it harder for people to put requirements on masks or asking for vaccination status into law. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Let&#8217;s see.&nbsp; Go ahead, Eugene.&nbsp; And then we&#8217;ll go to you next.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have no (inaudible).&nbsp; I don’t have a metaphor for you on &#8212; (laughs) &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; That&#8217;s okay.&nbsp; You don’t need one.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Has the President or anyone from the White House been in contact with Republican senators and leadership over there to talk about the eviction moratorium?&nbsp; We’ve been talking about the House a lot.&nbsp; Obviously, you know, they are the ones that are sleeping outside of the Capitol, but it would take 10 votes from Republicans also to get an eviction moratorium.&nbsp; Are you guys in contact with leadership?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We are in contact with Republicans and Democrats about a range of issues, and we certainly welcome anyone in the Republican caucus who wants to work together on an eviction moratorium.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the President calling on the Senate to take it up &#8212; an eviction moratorium?&nbsp; Because they are in session.&nbsp; They&#8217;re still here.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; That would also require &#8212; yes, as you said, it would also require Congress to act.&nbsp; You need both houses to act.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Again, I think this is a matter of whether there is support in caucuses to do that.&nbsp; That is a challenge.&nbsp; Even the most passionate advocates who are out there &#8212; and we certainly stand by them and support their same objective of extending the eviction moratorium &#8212; cannot do it on their own.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>We certainly would like to see legislation.&nbsp; The President would love to sign that into law.&nbsp; That, as you said, would require both houses of Congress.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And my last question, sorry.&nbsp; The &#8212; you mentioned Texas &#8212; that&#8217;s the state that is being touted as not just being number one, but also they have the best system.&nbsp; The way that it&#8217;s been happening is it&#8217;s going straight to landlords and people who own homes and are renting it out.&nbsp; Is that what other states should be doing?&nbsp; Should they be copying Texas in how they disburse these funds?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Different &#8212; different approaches are going to work for different states.&nbsp; But I do think, if Texas can do it, if Virginia can do it, then other states can do it as well.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And one of our objectives is connecting leaders, connecting to share best practices to figure out how they can get this assistance out to renters.&nbsp; And there&#8217;s no question it is challenging.&nbsp; There isn&#8217;t a great national infrastructure in place.&nbsp; That&#8217;s something that we should have a conversation about too, and Gene talked about that yesterday.<br>&nbsp;<br>But, right now, we wanted to lift up and highlight states where they are getting the money out effectively because they can be models for other states around the country.<br>&nbsp;<br>Go ahead.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Real quick, a couple of different topics.&nbsp; The first: the President&#8217;s effort in &#8212; to preventing evictions in states that are tremendously affected.&nbsp; You mentioned that there were incentives to some of the landlords who cooperate with the efforts, but I didn&#8217;t see what those incentives are.&nbsp; And are there repercussions if we later find that money goes unused and is &#8212; or is diverted to something else?&nbsp; That&#8217;s my question on &#8212; for &#8212; on evictions.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, certainly, if money was not used for its intended purpose, that would be a concern.&nbsp; And certainly, we are &#8212; take waste, fraud, and abuse quite seriously.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>I think the President had called for a number of steps &#8212; or we called for, I should say, a number of steps that could be taken, even as we&#8217;re pressing and kicking the tires &#8212; (laughter) &#8212; looking for all of our legal options, even as we&#8217;re doing that.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And I mentioned the states because there is a lot of money that can go out in states and can effectively go out.&nbsp; And a number of states &#8212; not all blue states &#8212; have done that very effectively.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So, I referenced &#8212; and you touched on one of them, but let me make sure I cover it.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s see.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So, there are states and communities.&nbsp; You know, there are also &#8212; he&#8217;s also asked federal agencies to use their power to prevent evictions and tell landlords.&nbsp; So, we have &#8212; so there are &#8212; any properties that are government-backed properties &#8212; so, if you get a government-backed loan for your mortgage, we&#8217;ve asked our agencies to prevent eviction.<br>&nbsp;<br>So, he is, again, using every step in his capacity to keep people in their homes.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On voting rights: Senator Klobuchar says that they&#8217;re nearing a voting rights deal.&nbsp; Is there anything that you can tell us in the deal &#8212; how the slimmed-down deal is looking?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And also, the President has also talked about &#8212; there are Republicans that he has been talking to.&nbsp; Are there &#8212; can you name any of the Republicans that, possibly could be &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; That wouldn&#8217;t be constructive to our end goal.&nbsp; I understand your interest.&nbsp; I will say that, you know, we&#8217;re certainly grateful for Senator Klobuchar&#8217;s work, the ongoing work by a range of leaders to figure out if there&#8217;s a path forward here.&nbsp; We&#8217;ll let them speak to the details when they&#8217;re ready to.&nbsp; And once they do, I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll have more to say.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then lastly, the New York Times reported, a couple of weeks ago, that the administration&#8217;s legal team advisors may be leaning towards returning the 4,000 on home confinement back to prison.&nbsp; Is there anything that we have coming from the administration on this?&nbsp; And does the administration really believe that it is easier to return those 4,000 people to federal prison than reviewing clemency petitions for them?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would say: One, that&#8217;s a DOJ action.&nbsp; So, I&#8217;d point you to them, in terms of what their steps are.&nbsp; And certainly, any decision about clemency would be made in coordination, but I have nothing to preview on that front.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, we&#8217;re told you have an out soon.&nbsp; Just one or two more.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; Of course.<br>&nbsp;<br>Nikki, go ahead.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you know if the President has spoken with Governor Cuomo today?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; No, he has not.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, just a quick scheduling thing.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yes.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you know if he will go to Mike Enzi&#8217;s funeral on Friday?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have anything to preview for you. &nbsp;I understand the interest.&nbsp; He did consider him a friend, but I don&#8217;t think a decision has been made quite yet.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Raquel, go ahead.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thank you so much, Jen.&nbsp; More than a million doses of vaccine expired and have gone to waste since December.&nbsp; What is the White House doing to avoid this waste?&nbsp; And could the U.S. be donating more vaccines to other countries and faster?&nbsp; And will President Biden soon announce more vaccines shared to the world?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, yes, he will announce this afternoon &#8212; that&#8217;s what his remarks are about &#8212; getting 110 million doses out.&nbsp; We also announced our purchase of 500 million Pfizer doses.&nbsp; He will talk about all of that this afternoon.<br>&nbsp;<br>I will just note, to give you just a little bit of a preview: He will also say that this work is just beginning.&nbsp; While we are &#8212; the United States remains &#8212; with the announcement today, we have &#8212; we will have donated to &#8212; more to the world than all of the countries in the U.N., including Russia and China, combined.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And this is just the beginning.&nbsp; We are going to continue to be a provider of vaccines and assistance to the global community in our fight against COVID.&nbsp; So, he will certainly talk about that today.&nbsp; And so, yes, there &#8212; there will certainly be more to come.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Let me note though for you on the &#8212; on the question you asked, Raquel, about waste: The COVID vaccine wastage rate nationally is approximately 2.6 percent, which is very low.&nbsp; Certainly, we don&#8217;t want any doses to be wasted.&nbsp; And what we do is we work with governors so that they can request &#8212; or state authorities, I should say &#8212; exactly the amount of vaccine doses that they want to reduce and prevent that waste.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>It&#8217;s important that we get as many people, of course, vaccinated.&nbsp; And sometimes that can mean opening a multi-dose vial and not using every dose, but we &#8212; we do everything we can to reduce waste.&nbsp; And certainly, we will continue to do that.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>All right, thanks everyone.<br>&nbsp;<br>3:06 P.M. EDT</p>

<p>Today, the President and Vice President met with 12 Latino leaders to discuss the Build Back Better Agenda and this Administration’s commitment to equity. During the meeting, the President and Vice President reiterated their promise to invest in Latino families and businesses across the country as we work to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic and the economic downfall that resulted from it. The President and Vice President discussed their belief in the American Dream and the promise of America for all, and they vowed to continue working to strengthen our democracy and protect voting rights. Two years after the El Paso massacre, they vowed to keep fighting against the most lethal terrorist threat to our homeland – domestic terrorism rooted in white supremacy, hate-fueled violence in all forms, and the scourge of gun violence in America. President Biden and Vice President Harris also restated their support for immigration reform in reconciliation that provides a path to citizenship for Dreamers, farm workers, TPS holders, and essential workers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>A little over a month ago, the President announced the Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework—a bipartisan agreement to make the largest long-term investment in our infrastructure and competitiveness in nearly a century. This week, the Senate is considering the Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, a once-in-a-generation investment in our infrastructure. The bipartisan infrastructure agreement will grow the economy, enhance our competitiveness, and make our economy more sustainable, resilient, and just.</p>



<p>The agreement will also create good-paying, union jobs. With the remainder of the President’s Build Back Better Agenda, these investments will add, on average, around 2 million jobs per year over the course of the decade, while accelerating America’s path to full employment and increasing labor force participation.</p>



<p>The Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act addresses economic disparities in our economy and the consequences of decades of disinvestment in America’s infrastructure that have fallen most heavily on communities of color. Through critical investments, the legislation increases access to good-paying jobs, affordable high-speed internet, reliable public transit, clean drinking water and other resources to ensure communities of color get a fair shot at the American dream.</p>



<p>These critical investments are first steps in advancing equity and racial justice throughout our economy. The President believes additional investments are needed in our nation’s caregiving infrastructure, housing supply, regional development, and workforce development programs to ensure that communities of color and other underserved communities can access economic opportunity and justice. And, earlier this summer in Tulsa, OK, President Biden announced a whole-of-government effort to increase the share of federal contracts going to small disadvantaged businesses by 50 percent over the next five years, leveraging the government’s purchasing power to help more Americans realize their entrepreneurial dreams.</p>



<p>The Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act:</p>



<p><strong>DELIVERS HIGH SPEED INTERNET TO EVERY AMERICAN HOUSEHOLD</strong></p>



<p>There is a stark digital divide in America. Black families are 9% less likely to have high-speed internet than their white peers, and Latino Americans are 15% less likely. About 35% of individuals living on Tribal lands lack access to broadband service. Although studies suggest high levels of digital access for Asian Americans, these studies are often limited in scope and don’t identify key inequities. For example, broadband access and affordability in the Pacific Islands has long been a challenge. During the COVID-19 pandemic, there were stories of kids sitting in McDonald’s parking lots to log on to remote school in parts of the country. The President believes this is unacceptable.</p>



<p>The agreement’s $65 billion investment ensures every American has access to reliable high-speed internet with an historic investment in broadband infrastructure deployment, just as the federal government made a historic effort to provide electricity to every American nearly one hundred years ago. This includes a $2 billion investment in broadband in Tribal communities which were hit particularly hard by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>



<p>The bill will also help lower prices for internet service by requiring funding recipients to offer a low-cost affordable plan, requiring providers to display a “Broadband Nutrition Label” that will help families comparison shop for a better deal, and by boosting competition in areas where existing providers aren’t providing adequate service.</p>



<p><strong>ELIMINATES LEAD PIPES AND DELIVERS CLEAN DRINKING WATER TO EVERY HOUSEHOLD</strong></p>



<p>Across the country, pipes and treatment plants are aging and polluted drinking water is endangering public health. There are up to 10 million homes with lead service lines and pipes. Children in up to 400,000 schools and child care facilities are at risk of exposure to lead. Across the country, families of color are at the highest risk for lead exposure at home and in schools. Communities of color in cities like Chicago, Milwaukee, and Newark are also at particular risk. For kids, higher exposure to lead can negatively affect academic performance, and can lead to cardiovascular disease later in life. By some estimates, each lead service line replaced at a cost of $5,000 per line leads to $22,000 in health savings.</p>



<p>The deal makes the largest investment in clean drinking water in American history, replacing all of the nation’s lead pipes and service lines. From rural towns to struggling cities, the deal invests in water infrastructure across America, including in Tribal Nations and disadvantaged communities that need it most. The deal also includes dedicated funding to deal with the dangerous chemical PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl).</p>



<p><strong>INVESTS IN MORE PUBLIC TRANSIT OPTIONS AND ADDRESSING THE BACKLOG OF REPAIRS</strong></p>



<p>Asian American and African American workers commute by public transit at nearly 4 times the rate of white workers. For example, low-wage Black residents in Chicago spend 70 additional minutes commuting to work than their white peers. In New York City, the average Black resident spends 110 minutes more per week commuting to work than the average white resident.</p>



<p>The Framework’s historic investment in public transit—the largest federal investment in history—will reduce commute times and create more economic opportunities in communities of color. In addition, bus and transit workers are 31% Black and 19% Hispanic, compared to 12% and 18% respectively of the workforce overall.</p>



<p>The Bipartisan Infrastructure deal is the largest Federal investment in public transit in history, and devotes a larger share of funds from surface transportation reauthorization to transit in the history of the programs. It will repair and upgrade aging infrastructure, modernize bus and rail fleets, make stations accessible to all users, and bring transit service to new communities. It will replace thousands of transit vehicles, including buses, with clean, zero emission vehicles.</p>



<p><strong>CREATES A FIRST-EVER PROGRAM TO RECONNECT COMMUNITIES DIVIDED BY INEQUITABLE TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE</strong></p>



<p>Significantportions of the interstate highway system were built through Black neighborhoods, destroying homes, schools, churches, and parks and causing lasting disconnection and disinvestment for residents who stayed.More broadly, historic investments in transportation infrastructure, especially highway construction, cut too many Americans off from opportunity, dividing and demolishing communities, and perpetuating economic and racial injustices. The legislation creates a first-ever program to reconnect communities divided by transportation infrastructure. The program will fund planning, design, demolition, and reconstruction of street grids, parks, or other infrastructure. This is in addition to other major grant programs that could fund elements of these projects.</p>



<p><strong>ELECTRIFY SCHOOL BUSES, IMPROVING THE AIR QUALITY FOR CHILDREN</strong></p>



<p>The legislation will make a critical down payment on helping the more than 25 million children and thousands of bus drivers who breathe polluted air on their rides to and from school. Diesel air pollution is linked to asthma and other health problems that hurt our communities and cause students to miss school, particularly in communities of color and Tribal communities. The legislation will deliver thousands of electric school buses nationwide, helping school districts across the country buy clean, American-made, zero emission buses, replacing the yellow school bus fleet for America’s children.</p>



<p><strong>REMEDIATES BROWNFIELD AND SUPERFUND SITES</strong></p>



<p>Across America, 26% of Black Americans and 29% of Hispanic Americans live within 3 miles of a Superfund site, a higher percentage than for the overall population. Proximity to a Superfund site can lead to elevated levels of lead in children’s blood. Recent studies demonstrate that cleaning up these sites can lead to a decrease in blood levels by approximately 13-26%.</p>



<p>The Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act provides the full American Jobs Plan funding level—$21 billion—to create good-paying union jobs plugging orphan oil and gas wells, cleaning up abandoned mines, and remediating Brownfield and Superfund sites. As we transition to a clean energy future, the Bipartisan Infrastructure deal will begin to remedy economic injustice for communities across the country that have relied on the fossil fuel industry and have been affected most by the impacts of climate change and pollution, including rural communities and communities of color.</p>



<p><strong>SAFEGUARDS COMMUNITIES OF COLOR FROM CLIMATE CRISES AND EXTREME WEATHER RISKS</strong></p>



<p>People of color are more likely to live in areas most vulnerable to flooding and other climate change-related weather events. For example, in the wake of Hurricane Harvey, Black and Hispanic residents were twice as likely to report lost income. Tribal lands are significantly at risk to the effects of climate change and Alaska Natives are particularly vulnerable, as they face multiple climate impacts.</p>



<p>The legislation invests in helping communities build resilience to wildfires and floods through investments in forest management and upgrades to critical infrastructure—like elevating buildings, roads, and bridges, hardening physical infrastructure, and winterizing the power grid. And, it will fund state and local infrastructure improvements and emergency response strategies, such as planning grants to support development of evacuation routes or upgrading community shelters. The legislation will also make it easier for low-income families to buy flood insurance.</p>



<p><strong>INVESTS IN CLEAN ENERGY GRID TO MITIGATE THE DISPARATE IMPACTS OF POLLUTION ON COMMUNITIES OF COLOR</strong></p>



<p>Black, Latino, Asian American and Pacific Islander, and Native communities are more likely to be burdened by pollution. Black people are almost three times more likely to die from asthma related causes than their white counterparts. And more than one in three—or over 23 million—Latinos in the U.S. live in counties where the air doesn’t meet EPA public health standards for smog.</p>



<p>The legislation’s roughly $65 billion investment is the single largest investment in clean energy transmission in American history. It upgrades our power infrastructure, including by building thousands of miles of new, resilient transmission lines to facilitate the expansion of renewable energy. It creates a new Grid Deployment Authority, invests in research and development for advanced transmission and electricity distribution technologies, and promotes smart grid technologies that deliver flexibility and resilience. It invests in demonstration projects and research hubs for next generation technologies like advanced nuclear reactors, carbon capture, and clean hydrogen.</p>
