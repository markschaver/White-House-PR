										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p><strong>Today, President Biden welcomed the historic commitment of the leaders of the G7 and guest countries to provide more than 1 billion additional COVID-19 vaccines for the world, starting this summer, of which the United States will contribute half a billion doses.</strong><br><br>This commitment forms the basis of a comprehensive set of G7+ actions towards ending this global pandemic in 2022. The G7+ action plan that will be agreed to by leaders in Cornwall includes vaccinating the world’s most vulnerable, providing emergency supplies, bolstering world-wide economic recovery, and positioning the international community to prepare for, prevent, detect, and respond to future biological catastrophes.&nbsp;<br><br>The United States will lead the G7+ in a global COVID-19 vaccination campaign, providing 500 million safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines for the world&nbsp;through COVAX, with delivery starting in&nbsp;August&nbsp;2021. This&nbsp;donation, which President Biden announced yesterday,&nbsp;is the largest single donation of vaccines in history and comprises half of the G7+ commitment to provide an additional 1 billion safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine doses over the next 12 months, especially to the world’s most vulnerable.<br><br>In addition,&nbsp;we are taking concrete&nbsp;and tangible steps to meet the ambition of the G7+ and drive action to end this pandemic and prevent the next.&nbsp;We call on other countries and private sector partners to join us.&nbsp;<br><br>To end the global&nbsp;COVID-19&nbsp;pandemic, the United States and the G7+ will:</p>



<ul><li><strong><u>Accelerate Vaccination of the World’s Most Vulnerable</u></strong><br><strong>We are fully committed to working towards the ambitious goal of ending the pandemic. </strong>Yesterday’s announcement of half a billion new vaccine doses comes on top of both the at least 80 million vaccine doses previously announced by President Biden and the $2 billion in funding which the United States has previously provided to Gavi to support COVAX. We call on countries to donate additional doses of safe and effective vaccines, strengthen vaccine readiness, and work with private sector partners to vaccinate the world. <br> </li><li><strong><u>Support Last Mile Vaccination and Getting Shots into Arms</u></strong><br>The Biden-Harris Administration will be providing hundreds of millions in support for programs that provide assistance to help countries and health systems prepare for vaccination around the world, including in Latin America, Asia, and Africa. That assistance comes on top of longstanding U.S. support for countries and communities around the world for immunization and strengthening health systems. <br> </li><li><strong><u>Save Lives Now with PPE and Emergency Medical Supplies</u></strong><br>The Biden-Harris Administration is investing in efforts to help fragile countries with their emergency response, including lifesaving medical and other supplies to tackle COVID-19 surges while strengthening their health systems, building capacity to manage surges, and preventing disease spread. We must expand our emergency responses, including by delivering lifesaving medical supplies, oxygen, diagnostics, therapeutics, and PPE. We are providing emergency assistance in 2021 to regions that need it most, including sending multiple flights and more than $100 million in health assistance to India, and supporting responses in South Asia and Latin America as countries experience surges in COVID-19 cases. <br><br>Through the $11.5 billion provided in the American Rescue Plan (ARP) for the global COVID-19 response, we will continue to strengthen our global response to and recovery from COVID-19, including by expanding investments in lifesaving medical supplies, including oxygen, diagnostics, therapeutics, and PPE. We urge the World Bank Group and the other Multilateral Development Banks to increase the speed of their financial support to the response.<br> </li><li><strong><u>Boosting Global Supply and Supporting Surge Capacity</u></strong><br>We must increase our investments in local production capacity for safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines, therapeutics, raw materials, diagnostics, and medical supplies. We will help develop and sustain a global vaccine supply network for this pandemic and the next.<br><br>The Biden-Harris Administration is investing, through the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC), in local production capacity for safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines, which will support at least 1 billion vaccine doses by the end of 2022. This includes our efforts through the Quad Vaccine Partnership of the United States, India, Japan, and Australia, and with peer Development Finance Institutions including the IFC, Proparco, and DEG to support vaccine manufacturing in Africa – for Africa. We strongly support the aim of developing a regional network of surge capacity to produce medical countermeasures, PPE, and other lifesaving treatments and supplies.</li></ul>



<p>We recognize that the above immediate actions to end the pandemic contribute to our collective longer-term preparedness. We are committed to developing sustainable surge capacity in every region to scale up medical countermeasures and supply production on a “no regrets” basis at the first sign of a health crisis.</p>



<p>Simultaneously, we will&nbsp;work&nbsp;expeditiously to&nbsp;advance global health security to prevent future biological catastrophes:</p>



<ul><li><strong><u>Transform Disease Surveillance and Early Warning</u></strong><br>We must substantially strengthen the rapid detection of infectious disease threats. We will support the establishment of a coordinated global surveillance network to improve disease forecasting and surveillance, enable swift detection of pathogens, and translate early detection into action. We commit to accelerate development, production, and deployment of safe and effective countermeasures within 100 days.<br><br>The Biden-Harris Administration is investing $500 million from the ARP to modernize public health data and infrastructure including establishing a new Center for Epidemic Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which will help lead a new global pandemic early warning network. The American Jobs Plan (AJP) includes $30 billion toward building U.S. pandemic readiness, including by accelerating our ability to develop, produce, and deploy safe and effective countermeasures within 100 days. <br> </li><li><strong><u>Advance Global Health Security</u></strong><br>We must work with other countries and private sector partners to reach agreement by the 2021 UN General Assembly on the creation of a catalytic global health security financing mechanism and for its sustainable funding. We also commit to establishing the needed governance, oversight, accountability and transparency for future health security threats. The Biden-Harris Administration is spearheading an effort, building a coalition of public and private partners around the world, to come to consensus and establish and sustainably fund a global health security financing mechanism in 2021. We have also requested at least $250 million through the President’s Fiscal Year 2022 Budget Request to support seed funding for this mechanism this year. We look forward to progress before this year’s United Nations General Assembly, including consensus on the governance and transparency required for future health emergencies. In this regard, the Biden-Harris Administration welcomes the Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response (IPPPR) recommendation to establish a Global Health Threats Council at the UN. </li></ul>



<p>And we will go further to Build Back Better:</p>



<ul><li><strong><u>Build Resilience to Recover</u></strong><br>We will not stop with ending the pandemic:&nbsp;we&nbsp;must also&nbsp;invest in the global recovery from COVID-19.&nbsp;The Biden-Harris&nbsp;Administration strongly supports assisting&nbsp;countries&nbsp;in&nbsp;recovering&nbsp;from the pandemic’s&nbsp;aftershocks.&nbsp;We&nbsp;seek to&nbsp;reorient our development finance tools to&nbsp;strengthen health systems,&nbsp;catalyze infrastructure investment&nbsp;in&nbsp;for&nbsp;low-and middle-income countries&nbsp;and&nbsp;reverse the&nbsp;secondary impacts&nbsp;that&nbsp;have sent millions into poverty and hunger, disrupting and destabilizing education, political, economic, and social systems. We&nbsp;strongly support the effort&nbsp;to recycle&nbsp;Special Drawing Rights&nbsp;(SDRs) to further support health needs.&nbsp;We will&nbsp;also&nbsp;maintain our strong commitment to global education and strengthening the resiliency of food systems, including by mitigating the disproportionate disruptions experienced by women and girls.</li></ul>



<p>The United States remains committed to saving lives and ending the COVID-19 pandemic now. We look forward to the adoption of the G7+ action plan this weekend. We call on other countries and private sector partners to support this ambition.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>Yesterday, as part of her ongoing engagement with stakeholders across the country, Deputy National Security Advisor for Cyber and Emerging Technology Anne Neuberger met with the bipartisan National Association of Attorneys General (NAAG) to speak to the cybersecurity challenges facing the nation, including the threat from ransomware. Neuberger stressed the important role state and local governments play in the nation’s cybersecurity, and emphasized the essential role attorneys general play in legal actions aimed at protecting state networks, ensuring consumer privacy, and prosecuting cybercrimes. She listened to the Attorneys General on the cyber challenges their states are facing, and briefed them on the measures that the public and private sector can immediately take to bolster cyber defenses.</p>



<p>Neuberger outlined the measures the Biden Administration has already taken to modernize cyber defenses, including the recent “Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity” Executive Order and the Administration’s ongoing efforts to partner with the public and private sectors to strengthen critical infrastructure cyber defenses. She spoke about the recent public-private Cybersecurity Industrial Control Systems Initiative and its pilot program to strengthen cyber resilience in the electric sector, noting the electric sector pilot will soon be followed by similar initiatives to strengthen the cyber resilience of other critical sectors like pipelines, water, and chemicals. Neuberger described the Biden Administration’s ransomware strategy which includes four lines of effort: disruption of ransomware infrastructure and actors by working closely with the private sector; international cooperation to hold countries who harbor ransom actors accountable; expanding cryptocurrency analysis to find and pursue criminal transactions; and reviewing the USG’s ransomware payment policies and approaches. She also underscored the President’s commitment to modernizing existing infrastructure while simultaneously investing in the infrastructure of the future.</p>



<p>In a reference to her <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Memo-What-We-Urge-You-To-Do-To-Protect-Against-The-Threat-of-Ransomware.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">open letter</a> to the private sector, Neuberger reiterated the need for private and public sector partnership to effectively guard against ransomware, recalling that much of U.S. critical infrastructure is owned and operated by the private sector. She reiterated her call to action that corporate leaders implement the discrete, high-impact cybersecurity measures contained in her open letter, and those referenced in the President’s Executive Order. Investing in cybersecurity is a far better investment for our economy and for companies than paying the funds in ransom.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>President Biden’s American Rescue Plan included historic investments to support low- and middle-income parents – who have long faced increasing financial strain, worsened by the pandemic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, the Biden-Harris administration is announcing Child Tax Credit Awareness Day on Monday, June 21st to ensure parents know about the American Rescue Plan’s historic expansion of the Child Tax Credit and how it will benefit their families. Critically, as part of Child Tax Credit Awareness Day, the administration will encourage elected officials, organizations that fight for children, and faith-based organizations, to help low-income families—who may have such low-incomes that they are not required to file taxes—to use a new, easy Child Tax Credit sign-up tool to help give their children a lifeline out of poverty. And, the administration is releasing guidance for three elements of the American Rescue Plan that will support families, including: $15 billion for the <a href="https://www.acf.hhs.gov/occ/policy-guidance/ccdf-acf-im-2021-03">Child Care and Development Block Grant</a>, an historic expansion of the <a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/child-and-dependent-care-tax-credit-faqs">Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit</a>, and six months of extended support for small and midsize employers offering paid sick and family leave in response to the pandemic through the <a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/tax-credits-for-paid-leave-under-the-american-rescue-plan-act-of-2021-for-leave-after-march-31-2021">Paid Leave Tax Credit</a>.</p>



<p>These measures will help parents by helping them with the costs of raising children – measures that experts project could contribute to cutting child poverty in half. They will also help defray the costs of child care, provide more child care options, and support return to work for those who have lost their jobs or income &#8212; especially mothers. And, they will do all of this while investing in the future of the nation’s children.</p>



<p>While the American Rescue Plan is providing historic investments to confront the effects of the pandemic and help provide immediate relief from COVID-19, President Biden is calling to extend historic tax relief for working families and increase high quality child care and available paid family and medical leave through the American Families Plan and American Jobs plan.</p>



<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Families need support to power an equitable economic recovery and to support healthy development for children who most need it</span><br></strong><br>We are experiencing a record-setting economic recovery, with historic growth in employment and wages. And, in the first four months of the Biden administration, more than 2 million jobs were created—an average of 540,000 jobs a month. But, our economy remains about 7.6 million jobs below its pre-pandemic level, and labor force participation remains more than 1 percentage point below its pre-pandemic level. Women were also particularly hard hit by the pandemic. More than one-half of the lost jobs—nearly 4.2 million—were once held by women, and 1.8 million women remain out of the labor force.</p>



<p>And, the pandemic has exacerbated many families’ distress. According to the <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/poverty-and-inequality/tracking-the-covid-19-recessions-effects-on-food-housing-and#_ftnref8">latest U.S. Census Pulse survey in May,</a> one third of all adults with children are struggling to pay their usual expenses like food, rent, health care, and transportation. One in eight adults living with children report their household doesn’t have enough food to eat. One in five renters living with children reported that they are not caught up on rent. Black and brown families and women are disproportionately feeling the strain of the pandemic. And, financial hardship has <a href="/Users/KGLandrieu/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/Content.Outlook/FWH13A5H/•%09Extends%20the%20Child%20Tax%20Credit%20in%20the%20American%20Rescue%20Plan,%20which%20helps%20families%20raising%20children%20make%20ends%20meet">long-term consequences </a>for the healthy development of children.</p>



<p>Families need economic relief. And, many parents need support to be able to return to work or continue working so they can provide economic security for their families.</p>



<p>In part, lack of high-quality, affordable child care can make it logistically difficult for parents to work. Indeed, many parents—particularly mothers—<a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/early-childhood/reports/2019/03/28/467488/child-care-crisis-keeping-women-workforce/">report</a>&nbsp;that they work fewer hours than they would prefer or need to in order to care for their young children. For some parents there is no choice but to find outside care if they want or need to work: as found in a recent&nbsp;<a href="https://bfi.uchicago.edu/wp-content/uploads/BFI_WP_202046.pdf">analysis</a>, one in five workers live in households with a child under 14, but do not live with a non-working adult who could potentially serve as a caregiver. And, this problem is most acute for single mothers.</p>



<p>According to the latest U.S. Census Pulse Survey in May, about 7.6 million adults had someone in their household who took paid or unpaid leave, left their job, lost their job, or did not look for a job in the last month because child care arrangements remain disrupted due to the pandemic—three in four of whom were women and half of whom were women of color. Another 1.2 million women continued to work-from-home while they or another family member cares for their children. &nbsp;</p>



<p>And, the pandemic laid bare the fact that the majority of&nbsp; low-wage workers have <a href="https://www.bls.gov/ncs/ebs/benefits/2020/employee-benefits-in-the-united-states-march-2020.pdf">no access</a> to paid sick leave or paid family and medical leave. Ninety-five percent of low-wage workers have no access to paid family and medical leave and 69 percent have no access to paid sick leave. This meant workers were left with few options to protect their own and their families’ health and well-being at the beginning of COVID. Paid leave is a critical policy for ensuring workers stay connected to the jobs when a health need or crisis arises, and thereby, not lose needed income or a job.</p>



<p>The American Rescue Plan is taking several steps to support family economic security and the healthy development of children.</p>



<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Help is Here: Child Tax Credit Awareness Day</span><br></strong><br>The American Rescue Plan delivered major tax relief for working families with children through a historic expansion of the Child Tax Credit. In 2021, for most families, the Child Tax Credit is increased to $3,000 for each child between 6 and 17 years old and to $3,600 for each child under age 6. For example, a married couple making less than $150,000 with two children under age 6 will be eligible for a Child Tax Credit of $7,200 in 2021–at least $3,200 more than they would have received prior to the American Rescue Plan.</p>



<p>While tax relief is typically available only when you file your taxes, thanks to the American Rescue Plan, Child Tax Credit payments will be provided monthly for the first time ever, beginning in July. This means needed relief will reach families sooner, and they can count on it each month to help make ends meet. To help with the costs of raising children, families will begin to receive monthly payments of up to $250 for each child 6 to 17 years old and $300 for each child under age 6. Under the American Rescue Plan, the Child Tax Credit will be fully refundable, meaning that if a family’s income tax bill is less than the amount of their Child Tax Credit, they will get a payment for the difference. This will ensure for the first time that even the most hard-pressed families will get at least as much support as more affluent families.</p>



<p>The IRS estimates that roughly 39 million households — covering almost 90 percent of children in the United States — are slated to begin receiving monthly payments without any further action required. Other eligible families— those who have not yet filed taxes in 2019 or 2020 and who did not sign-up for Economic Impact Payments like the $1,400 rescue payments included in the American Rescue Plan—can still sign-up to receive monthly Child Tax Credit payments beginning this summer. Experts project that the expanded Child Tax Credit could potentially help lift one-half of all children out of poverty if all eligible families sign-up to receive the monthly payments.</p>



<p>Today, the Biden-Harris administration is announcing that Monday, June 21st will be Child Tax Credit Awareness Day—a day of action to get the word out far and wide on the upcoming monthly payments that will benefit nearly all families. It is also important that we extend these benefits beyond 2021 as the President has proposed in his American Families Plan. The administration will be calling on elected officials, faith-based groups, organizations that fight for children and families, and other partners to join us on June 21st to raise awareness that help is on the way.</p>



<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Child Care Development Block Grant Guidance</span><br></strong><br>The Biden Administration has provided states with unprecedented funding for expansions and improvements for child care, providing states with a tremendous opportunity to invest in early care and learning. The American Rescue Plan’s $39 billion investment in child care is historic on its own, and the administration has gone further to encourage state and local governments to finance quality child care options for parents and increase wages for the early childhood workforce. The Administration of Children and Families released <a href="https://www.acf.hhs.gov/occ/policy-guidance/ccdf-acf-im-2021-03">guidance </a>to States, Territories, and Tribes for the American Rescue Plan’s $15 billion in discretionary Child Care and Development Block Grants (CCDBG). The guidance strongly recommends that lead agencies focus resources on investing in child care in ways that strengthen the child care system and ensure that families have equal access to quality, affordable child care to support them during and after the pandemic. To do that, it:</p>



<ul><li>Strongly recommends that lead agencies prioritize increasing provider payment rates and workforce compensation so that child care providers can retain a skilled workforce and deliver higher-quality care to children receiving subsidies.<ul><li>While the economy has added <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CES6562440001">45,000</a> child care jobs since January, more than <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CES6562440001">one in eight </a>child care jobs have yet to return since the start of the pandemic. And, because of the lack of resources in the child care industry, annual turnover rates for child care workers were high even before the pandemic. The inability of providers to recruit and retain a high-quality workforce hinders access to care in many communities. And, for those who can access care, high turnover often disrupts the stable relationships between children and providers that are important to child development and wellbeing. The <a href="https://daneshyari.com/article/preview/353687.pdf">quality of the classroom environment</a> and interactions between teachers and students are linked to children’s school readiness skills, and <a href="https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED477480.pdf">higher compensation</a> for the child care workforce is associated with better quality literacy environments. But, <a href="https://cscce.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/ReportFINAL.pdf">nearly half</a> of child care workers – who are disproportionately women of color &#8212; rely on public income supports. Child care workers experiencing <a href="https://cscce.berkeley.edu/educator-work-environments-are-childrens-learning-environments-how-and-why-they-should-be-improved/">economic stress</a> have a more difficult time fully engaging with children and offering a quality learning experience.</li><li>Using these funds to increase payment rates to providers and workers’ compensation will improve care quality, give parents a wider range of options from which to choose, boost wages for a chronically underpaid workforce, and better support the small businesses that comprise the child care sector.</li><li>The guidance reminds lead agencies that the CCDBG Act requires that payment rates are sufficient to ensure equal access for eligible children to child care services that are comparable to those provided to children whose parents are not eligible to receive assistance, and it notes that many states will need to make progress to meet equal access requirements in the CCDBG Act.<br></li></ul></li><li>Recommends that, secondarily, lead agencies implement policies that will:<ul><li>Build the supply of child care in low-income communities, especially for historically underserved populations</li><li>Provide child care assistance to families who have lost employment or income during the pandemic</li></ul></li></ul>



<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit</span><br></strong><br>The American Rescue Plan’s historic expansion of the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit (CDCTC) will make child care more affordable for millions of working families in 2021. Today, the Internal Revenue Service released <a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/child-and-dependent-care-tax-credit-faqs">guidance</a> providing additional details on this critical assistance.</p>



<p>Reducing the&nbsp;cost&nbsp;of child care increases labor force participation among mothers of young children— which expands the workforce, provides additional income to parents, and grows the economy. A recent&nbsp;<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-016-9331-3">review</a>&nbsp;of research on child care costs and women’s labor supply finds that a 10 percent decrease in the cost of child care to families leads to a 0.5 to 2.5 percent increase in mother’s employment.</p>



<p>Thanks to the historic expansion of the CDCTC in the American Recovery Plan, child care is more affordable for families this year, helping parents work and supporting economic security of families. Specifically:</p>



<ul><li>A median income family with two kids under age 13 will receive up to $8,000 towards their child care expenses when they file taxes for 2021, compared with a maximum of $1,200 previously.</li><li>All families with incomes up to $125,000 will save up to one-half the cost of their eligible child care expenses, getting back up to $4,000 for one child and $8,000 for two or more children when they file taxes for 2021. By comparison, the same families in 2020 would have had only up to one-fifth of their eligible expenses covered, receiving no more than $600 for one child or $1,200 for two or more children. And, in 2021, families making between $125,000 and $400,000 can still receive a partial credit at least as generous as the credit they would have received in 2020.</li><li>And, for the first time, the CDCTC will be fully refundable, making the credit fairer by allowing low-income working families to receive the full value of the credit towards their eligible child care expenses regardless of how much they owe on their 2021 taxes.</li></ul>



<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Paid Leave Tax Credit</span><br></strong><br>Today, the Internal Revenue Service is also releasing <a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/tax-credits-for-paid-leave-under-the-american-rescue-plan-act-of-2021-for-leave-after-march-31-2021">guidance</a> for the American Rescue Plan’s paid leave tax credit. The advanceable, refundable tax credit offsets the cost for employers who voluntarily provide eligible employees paid sick or family leave, either for the employee&#8217;s own health needs or to care for family members.</p>



<p>Employers with fewer than 500 employees and certain government employers may receive up to $17,110 to provide employees with up to 10 days of paid sick leave and up to 12 weeks of paid family leave, from April 1 through September 30, 2021. Certain self-employed individuals in similar circumstances are entitled to similar credits. Roughly <a href="https://cdn.advocacy.sba.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/04144224/2020-Small-Business-Economic-Profile-US.">6 million businesses</a> and more than <a href="https://cdn.advocacy.sba.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/04144224/2020-Small-Business-Economic-Profile-US.">30 million workers</a> are eligible for this credit.</p>



<p>Tax credits can be claimed for employees who take time off because they are:</p>



<ul><li>exposed to COVID-19 or experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 and seeking a diagnosis, or caring for someone who has been exposed to COVID-19 or is experiencing COVID symptoms</li><li>caring for a child whose school or child care has been closed or unavailable due to COVID–19</li><li>getting a vaccine or recovering from it</li><li>subject to, or is caring for someone who is subject to, a COVID-19 quarantine or isolation order</li></ul>



<p>The Biden Administration strongly encourages employers to provide paid leave and take advantage of these credits. They can help ensure safe and healthy workplaces, while also ensuring that Americans can reenter or stay in the workforce as we continue to fight the virus and recover from the economic effects of COVID-19. Research has shown that states where employees gained access to paid sick leave through this tax credit experienced a <a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.2020.00863">slow-down in the spread of COVID</a>.</p>



<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Investing in Child Care and Paid Leave for the Long-Term</span><br></strong><br>Finally, President Biden is calling to permanently increase access to economic relief for families, high quality child care, and available paid family and medical leave. Even before the pandemic, a middle-class life – the ability to buy a home, afford child care, send a kid to college, save up to retire with dignity – was increasingly out of reach for families, and especially for women and people of color. While the American Rescue Plan is providing historic investments to confront the effects of the pandemic and help provide immediate relief from COVID-19, the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/28/fact-sheet-the-american-families-plan/">American Families Plan</a> and <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/03/31/fact-sheet-the-american-jobs-plan/">American Jobs Plan</a> will reimagine and rebuild a new, stronger economy that leaves no one behind. They will:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Extend the historic increase in the Child Tax Credit included in the American Rescue Plan</strong>, continuing major, monthly tax relief for families of up to $3,600 for each child to help parents meet the costs of raising children.</li><li><strong>Guarantee low- and middle-income families will spend no more than 7 percent of their income on high-quality child care for young children</strong>. The President’s Council of Economic Advisers estimates, based on a recent literature review, that this cost reduction could increase employment for parents that benefit by between four and 20 percent. High-quality child care also can provide lifetime benefits for children as they grow up healthier, do better in school, and earn more over the course of their lifetimes.</li><li><strong>Make permanent the American Rescue Plan’s expansion of the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit</strong>, so that families can continue to get back up to $8,000 of their child care expenses.</li><li><strong>Build the supply of child care</strong> including by building and upgrading facilities across the country.</li><li><strong>Invest in training and professional development of the child care workforce.</strong></li><li><strong>Establish a national comprehensive paid family and medical leave program</strong> that will bring America in line with competitor nations that offer paid leave programs. This new benefit, provided by the federal government, will ensure workers partial wage replacement to take time to bond with a new child; care for a seriously ill loved one; deal with a loved one&#8217;s military deployment; find safety from sexual assault, stalking, or domestic violence; heal from their own serious illness; or take time to deal with the death of a loved one. It will be available to workers regardless of employer size, sector, or type of employment.</li></ul>



<p>These investments will help build on the momentum of the American Rescue Plan to create a stronger, more equitable economy that supports families and strengthens the middle class.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>The Child Care Development Block Grant guidance released today will help states invest the $15 billion provided to them on </strong><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/15/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-american-rescue-plan-funding-to-rescue-the-child-care-industry-so-the-economy-can-recover/"><strong>April 15</strong></a><strong>.</strong> </span>The American Rescue Plan’s historic $39 billion investment in child care was provided to state, tribal, and territorial partners through two programs: (1) $24 billion for a new child care stabilization fund to help child care providers reopen or stay open, provide safe and healthy learning environments<strong>, </strong>keep workers on payroll, and provide mental health supports for educators and children, and (2) $15 billion in more flexible funding to help more low-income working families access high-quality care, increase compensation for early childhood workers, and help parents to work.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>The United States is rallying the world’s democracies to deliver for our people, meet the world’s biggest challenges, and demonstrate our shared values</em></p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">Today, President Biden will meet with G7 leaders to discuss ways to forge a more fair, sustainable, and inclusive global economy that meets the unique challenges of our time. President Biden and G7 partners are committed to a global recovery that benefits the middle class and working families at home and around the world.</p>



<p>President Biden and G7 leaders agreed to continue providing policy support to the global economy for as long as necessary to create a strong, balanced, and inclusive economic recovery.&nbsp; In addition, leaders are expected to announce that the G7 is:</p>



<p><strong>Rallying around the US proposal for Strong Global Minimum Tax.  </strong>G7 leaders will endorse a strong global minimum tax of at least 15 percent. This U.S. priority is a critical step towards ending the decades-long race to the bottom that pushes nations to compete over who can offer the lowest tax rate to large corporations at the expense of protecting workers, investing in infrastructure, and growing the middle class.</p>



<p>This unprecedented progress reflects the Biden Administration’s commitment to building a global tax system that is equitable and equipped to meet the needs of the 21st century global economy. By making big multinational corporations pay their fair share and raising resources to fund priorities for domestic renewal – such as infrastructure, childcare, affordable housing, and education – a global corporate minimum tax is a key part of our efforts to deliver a foreign policy for the middle class, and will help support working families everywhere.&nbsp; This agreement is a clear illustration of how American leadership and commitment to multilateralism can produce results for American workers and businesses.<br><br>Today’s agreement paves the way for the removal of Digital Service Taxes (DSTs) and other discriminatory taxes. In addition to agreement on a global minimum tax, the G7 also reached historic agreement on a plan to replace DSTs with a broader reallocation of taxing rights to the places where the largest and most profitable multinational corporations are doing business and making money. Importantly, this applies to large multinationals broadly, both domestic and foreign, and not just the technology sector. This is an important principle for the United States, and will ensure that big multinational companies across the economy will pay a little more in the places where they operate, whether or not they have their headquarters there.<br><br><strong>Exploring a Major Reallocation of Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) to Countries in Need:&nbsp; </strong>The United States and our G7 partners are actively considering a global effort to multiply the impact of the International Monetary Fund’s proposed&nbsp; Special Drawing Rights (SDR) allocation to the countries most in need.&nbsp; At potentially up to $100 billion in size, the proposed effort would further support health needs &#8211; including vaccinations &#8211; and help enable greener, more robust economic recoveries in vulnerable countries, and promote a more balanced, sustained, and inclusive global recovery.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>More detail will be included in the G7 Leaders’ Communique.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>12:54 P.M. BST<br> <br>MODERATOR: And so, again, in the interest of time, we&#8217;re going to move on to this next section. <br> <br>I am now going to pass it back to [senior administration official], again, joined by [senior administration official], to preview the G7 Summit, as well as the economic deliverables to come out of that. <br> <br>A reminder that this section, unlike the other two, is embargoed until tomorrow morning, June 11th, 7:00 a.m. British Summer Time. <br> <br>So, [senior administration officials], we&#8217;ll pass it back to you.<br> <br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:   Thanks.  I&#8217;ll start and just point out, you know, this is the first G7 Summit in nearly two years.  It&#8217;s the first G7 Summit that President Biden is attending.  It is the first G7 Summit that has been held since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.  And we think it is an incredibly important moment for the G7 for all the reasons I was just describing. <br> <br>As the President has said many times, we are entering a period in which the question has been called between democracies and autocracies.  And pulling together the G7, plus our partner countries, we believe would demonstrate that we&#8217;re unified in our resolve to show that democracy and shared democratic values provide the single best path for delivering results for our people and for meeting the biggest challenges of the world. <br> <br>And I want to just reinforce that last point.  Top to bottom, the driving, animating purpose of this G7 Summit is to show that democracies can deliver against the biggest challenges we are facing in the world. <br> <br>So, on the global economy, the G7 will be spending its time here talking about how it can most effectively contribute to the global economic recovery and to global economic fairness, including through things like committing to this global minimum tax.<br> <br>On COVID-19, as we&#8217;ve already talked about, not only will there be a significant commitment of doses, but an embrace of a broader roadmap to help end the pandemic.<br> <br>On climate, we will have more to say over the next couple of days, but the G7 countries will not only recommit to what they&#8217;ve laid out at the President&#8217;s Leaders Summit on Climate, as well as their own national contributions, but there will be tangible action proposed and adopted at this G7, on climate. <br> <br>And then, in terms of infrastructure and the enormous need for low- and middle-income countries around the world to have their infrastructure requirements met, the G7+ will embrace a high-standards, transparent, climate-friendly, non-corrupt mechanism for investing in the physical, digital, and health infrastructure of low- and middle-income countries.  It will be an alternative to that which other countries, including China, are offering. <br> <br>And then, of course, there will be discussion of all of the hotspots and the key regional challenges, as well as the way in which new technologies are reshaping our world.  So they will discuss ransomware and how to set the rules of the road on all forms of emerging technology so that it’s democracies, and not autocracies, who are laying the foundation for standards as we go forward.<br> <br>All of this will end up getting enshrined in the G7 leaders communiqué that will be released at the conclusion of the summit.  There will be a few other leader-level documents as well, but that&#8217;s the broad basis of what we&#8217;re trying to accomplish: meaningful outcomes on COVID, on climate, on the global economy, on infrastructure, on ransomware, and cyber. <br> <br>And when you add it all up, I think a fair read of what will come out of these next few days is one of the most substantive, if not the most substantive, set of deliverables out of the G7 in long memory.  It&#8217;s &#8212; there&#8217;s going to be a lot packed into these three days and a number of significant, concrete outcomes.<br> <br>So, with that, let me turn it over to [senior administration official].<br> <br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yeah, thanks, [senior administration official].  So I&#8217;ll talk about the first working session of the G7, which is going to be tomorrow.  And it&#8217;s going to focus on the global economy. <br> <br>So, let me give some context, which is that the U.S. is once again leading the world economy into recovery from a position of strength at home. <br> <br>And as you know, this is a dramatic turnaround from when the President took office four months ago.  U.S. economic growth projections for this year have doubled since December; they&#8217;re projected to be the fastest in almost 40 years. <br> <br>The labor market is clearly gathering strength.  The economy has added over 540,000 jobs on average since the President took office, the most over four months of any presidency. <br> <br>Unemployment has fallen from above 14 percent to under 6 percent, and it&#8217;s expected to return to pre-pandemic levels by 2023, which is about seven years faster than compared to the post-2009 recovery.  Actually, if you look at the latest jobs report, it showed the largest one-month drop in long-term unemployment in a decade. <br> <br>And for context, long-term unemployment is especially pernicious to the labor force.  The longer one is unemployed, the more difficult, historically, it&#8217;s been to find new employment. <br> <br>So, you know, that&#8217;s the context.  And importantly, as we head into these G7 meetings, the strength of the U.S. economy is helping to power the global economic recovery.  Both the OECD and the IMF estimate that U.S. economic growth this year will add a percentage point to global growth.  And this is coming after 2020 &#8212; a year in which global growth contracted 3.5 percent, which is the worst peacetime recession since the Great Depression. <br> <br>So these economic outcomes, as [senior administration officials] both alluded to, they&#8217;re the result of deliberate choices: the wartime, whole-of-government effort that [senior administration official] described to beat back the pandemic, but also the bold and unflinching decision the President made to go big and upfront on fiscal support and the plans to make generational investments to address structural challenges and lift the economy&#8217;s growth potential by addressing longstanding disparities and by boosting the innovation and dynamism of the economy. <br> <br>So, here at the G7, we&#8217;ll continue to make efforts to accelerate the global growth recovery, which, in turn, will create long-term benefits to U.S. exports and U.S. jobs. <br> <br>So we&#8217;ll do that in three ways.  We&#8217;ll &#8212; leaders will encourage G7 partners to continue providing near-term fiscal support to create a balanced global recovery, as well as long-term structural investments to boost our innovation and dynamism together. <br> <br>We will also build on the commitment from finance ministers, last week, to give active consideration to channel a proportion of the IMF&#8217;s plans to allocate $650 billion in economic support through Special Drawing Rights to multiply the impact of that allocation to lower-income countries where the pandemic response needs are the greatest and where the economic recovery has been slowest. <br> <br>And the last thing I&#8217;ll mention before we can take questions is: Leaders will also endorse the historic agreement reached last week by finance ministers for a global minimum corporate tax of at least 15 percent.  It&#8217;s a major statement to have G7 unity on this effort.  It will serve as a springboard to getting broader agreement at the G20.  So we see this as a critical step towards ending the race to the bottom on corporate taxes that&#8217;s come at the expense of workers, at the expense of investments in domestic renewal, and at the expense of growing the middle class.<br> <br>I&#8217;ll stop there.<br> <br>MODERATOR:  Thanks so much.  So, we have time for a couple of questions.  So, if you&#8217;ve got a question on this recent G7 section or the economic deliverables, please use the “raise hand” function.<br> <br>Okay, no questions.  As a reminder that this most recent section &#8212; oh, coming in at the last second.  Well, why don&#8217;t we start with Andrew Restuccia with the Wall Street Journal.<br> <br>Q    Thanks.  I wanted to ask [senior administration official] about the Johnson meeting just because we only got one question on that.  Can you talk a little bit about Northern Ireland specifically and what the President might tell the Prime Minister on that subject?  And I would love for you to respond to this report in the Times of the UK, as well, if you could.  Thanks.<br> <br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  All right, sure.  On Northern Ireland, the President is going to say to the Prime Minister what he has said publicly for a long time now, including as recently as St. Patrick&#8217;s Day, which is that he believes that the Good Friday Agreement is the foundation for peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland; that a lot of progress has been made over the 20-plus years since the Good Friday Agreement came into force and that that progress must be protected; and that the outcome of the current discussions between the UK and the EU should ensure the continued vitality of the Good Friday Agreement.<br> <br>You know, the United States is not in those negotiations and not seeking to be in those negotiations.  And we are instead a strong and vigorous supporter of practical, creative, flexible, results-oriented negotiations that, at the end of the day, produce a result that protects all of the gains that the people of Northern Ireland &#8212; that all communities in Northern Ireland have made.  And that&#8217;s what he&#8217;s going to say.<br> <br>It will not be confrontational or adversarial or &#8212; you know, he didn&#8217;t come here to give a lecture.  He came merely to communicate what he believes very, very deeply about peace in Northern Ireland, about the priority the United States places on that, about the priority Joe Biden places on that.  And that&#8217;s the spirit with which he&#8217;ll approach the conversation.<br> <br>MODERATOR:  Thank you.  And so, in the interest of time, we&#8217;re going to have to conclude.  Thanks so much for everyone joining.<br> <br>As a friendly reminder, again, this most recent section on the G7 preview and economic deliverables is embargoed until tomorrow, June 11th, 7:00 a.m. British Summer Time.  And the other two sections on the COVID-19 vaccine announcement, as well as the preview of the President&#8217;s bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Johnson are embargoed until this call concludes, which will be momentarily.<br> <br>Thank you again for all your time.  And we&#8217;ll be in touch very soon.<br> <br>12:57 P.M. BST</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Tregenna Castle Resort<br>Cornwall, United Kingdom</p>



<p>6:28 P.M. BST<br><br>PRESIDENT BIDEN:&nbsp; Good evening, everyone.&nbsp; First, I want to express our condolences on behalf of Jill and I to Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II, the entire Royal Family, and the people of the United Kingdom.&nbsp; Today would have been Prince Philip’s 100th birthday, and I know there are a lot of people feeling his absence today.&nbsp;<br><br>In addition, I&#8217;d like to point out that the &#8212; the greet from the British government has been exemplary.&nbsp; We’ve had a good first full day here in the UK.&nbsp; Prime Minister Johnson and I had a very productive meeting.&nbsp; We discharged and discussed a broad range of issues on which the United Kingdom and the United States are working in very close cooperation.<br><br>We affirmed the Special Relationship &#8212; and it&#8217;s not said lightly &#8212; the Special Relationship between our people, and we renewed our commitment to defending the enduring democratic values that both our nations share &#8212; (clears throat) &#8212; that are the strong &#8212; excuse me &#8212; the strong foundation of our partnership.<br><br>Eighty years ago, Prime Minister Winston Churchill and President Franklin Roosevelt signed an agreement known as the Atlantic Charter.&nbsp; It was a statement of first principles &#8212; a promise that the United Kingdom and the United States would meet the challenges of their age and they would meet it together.<br><br>Today, we’ve built on that commitment with a revitalized Atlantic Charter updated to reaffirm that promise while speaking directly to the key challenges of this century: cybersecurity, emerging technologies, global health, and climate change.<br><br>We discussed our common goals for driving ambitious global action to address the climate crisis.&nbsp; The Climate Leaders Summit that I hosted in April was, in part, about helping drive forward the momentum toward the critical COP 26 that the UK will host in Glasgow later this year.<br><br>We talked about the shared sacrifices our service members have made, bravely serving side by side in Afghanistan for close to 20 years.&nbsp; The UK was with us from the start, as they always are, equally committed to rooting out the terrorist threat, and now we&#8217;re coordinating our withdrawal together.<br><br>And, of course, we talked about how our two nations can, together, lead the global fight against COVID-19.&nbsp; That’s been a major focus of the G7 under British leadership, particularly in focusing and coordinating our resources to help vaccinate the world.<br><br>And tonight, I&#8217;m making a historic announcement regarding America’s leadership in the fight against COVID-19.&nbsp; America knows firsthand the tragedies of this pandemic.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve had &#8212; we&#8217;ve had more people die in the United States than anywhere in the world: nearly 600,000 of our fellow Americans &#8212; moms, dads, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters, grandparents.&nbsp; More deaths from COVID-19 in the United States than from World War One, World War Two, the Vietnam War, and 9/11 combined &#8212; combined.&nbsp; We know the tragedy.<br><br>But we also know the path to recovery.&nbsp; The United States has now vaccinated 64 percent of our adults with at least one shot.&nbsp; Just four and half months ago, we were at only 5 percent with one shot.<br><br>It took a herculean effort on the part of our government to manage one of the biggest and, I would say, most complicated logistical challenges in our history.&nbsp; It took the ingenuity of scientists, building on decades of research, to develop a vaccine.&nbsp; It took the full capacity of American companies manufacturing and delivering the vaccines around the clock.<br><br>And as a result, we have the lowest number of daily deaths since the first day of this pandemic.&nbsp; Our economy is rebounding.&nbsp; Our vaccination program has already saved tens of thousands of lives, with that count growing each day.&nbsp; And it has allowed millions &#8212; millions of Americans to get back to living their lives.<br><br>And from the beginning of my presidency, we have been clear-eyed that we need to attack this virus globally as well.&nbsp; This is about our responsibility &#8212; our humanitarian obligation to save as many lives as we can &#8212; and our responsibility to our values.<br><br>We value the inherent dignity of all people.&nbsp; In times of trouble, Americans reach out to offer help and to offer a helping hand.&nbsp; That’s who we are.<br><br>And when we see people hurting and suffering anywhere around the world, we seek to help as best we can.&nbsp; That’s why,&nbsp;under both Republican and Democratic Presidents, the United States has made transformative commitments to bolster global health &#8212; commitments under President Bush, like PEPFAR, which changed the global fight against HIV/AIDS.&nbsp; And in this moment, our values call on us to do everything that we can to vaccinate the world against COVID-19.<br><br>It&#8217;s also in America’s self-interest.&nbsp; As long as the virus rages elsewhere, there is a risk of new mutations that could threaten our people.&nbsp;<br><br>We know that raging COVID-19 in other countries holds back global growth, raises instability, and weakens governments.&nbsp; And as we’ve seen in the United States, with the evidence clearer day by the day, the key to reopening and growing economies is to vaccinate your people.&nbsp;<br><br>Our vaccination program has helped the American economy begin to recover from the worst economic crisis in a century.&nbsp; Over 2 million new jobs created just in the last four months since I&#8217;ve become President.&nbsp; A historic decline in long-term unemployment.&nbsp; Businesses reopening and a projected economic growth of nine point &#8212; excuse me, 6.9 percent &#8212; the fastest in nearly four decades in America.<br><br>Just as the American economy is recovering, it is in all of our interests to have the global economy begin to recover as well.&nbsp; And that won’t happen unless we can get the pandemic under control worldwide.<br><br>That&#8217;s why, as I said in my address to the joint session of Congress in April, America will be the arsenal of vaccines in our fight against COVID- &#8212; COVID-19, just as America was the arsenal of democracy during World War Two.<br><br>Over the past four months, we have taken a number of steps toward this historic effort.&nbsp; We have contributed more than any nation to COVAX &#8212; a collective global effort that is delivering COVID-19 vaccines across the world.<br><br>We have supported manufacturing efforts abroad through our partnerships with Japan, India, and Australia &#8212; known as the &#8220;Quad.&#8221;&nbsp; We&#8217;ve shared doses with our neighbors Canada and Mexico.<br><br>And in addition, three weeks ago, with America’s vaccines &#8212; America&#8217;s vaccine supply secured and with confidence we have enough vaccines to cover every American who wants one, we announced that we would donate 80 million doses of our own vaccine &#8212; in house now &#8212; to supply the world by the end of June.&nbsp; Many of these doses are shipping to countries around the world as we speak.<br><br>And today, we&#8217;re taking a major step that will supercharge the global fight against this pandemic.&nbsp; At my direction, the United States will purchase an additional half billion doses from Pfizer &#8212; the Pfizer vaccine &#8212; that we&#8217;ll donate nearly 100 low- and lower-middle-income countries.&nbsp;&nbsp; They will be the beneficiaries.&nbsp;<br><br>Let me say that again: The United States will purchase a half a billion doses of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine to donate to nearly 100 nations that are in dire need in the fight against this pandemic.&nbsp; That&#8217;s a historic step.&nbsp; The largest single purchase and donation of COVID-19 vaccines by any single country ever.<br><br>Importantly, this is an mRNA vaccine, which is proven to be extremely effective against COVID-19 and every known variant of that virus thus far.<br><br>These half a billion vaccines will start to be shipped in August as quickly as they roll off the manufacturing line.&nbsp; Two hundred million of these doses will be delivered this year, in 2021, and 300 million more will be delivered in the first half of 2022.<br><br>Let me be clear: Just as with the 80 million doses&nbsp;we previously announced, the United States is providing these half million [billion] doses with no strings attached.&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me say it again: with no strings attached.<br><br>Our vaccine donations don’t include pressure for favors or potential conce- &#8212; concessions.&nbsp; We’re doing this to save lives, to end this pandemic.&nbsp; That&#8217;s it.&nbsp; Period.&nbsp;<br><br>I also want thank Albert Bourla, Pfizer’s CEO and Chairman, for joining me today.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve gotten to know each other over the last few months.&nbsp; He and I and his entire team have really &#8212; he&#8217;s really stepped up at this critical stage in our fight against the pandemic.<br><br>And the plan is for a half a billion doses that we&#8217;ll be sending around the world to be produced in the United States,<br>including at Pfizer’s manufacturing plant in Kalamazoo, Michigan.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Eighty years ago, not too far from that plant in Kalamazoo in the Detroit area, American workers built tanks and planes and vehicles that helped defeat the global threat of fascism in World War Two.&nbsp; They built what became known as the “arsenal of democracy.”<br><br>Now, a new generation of American men and women, working with the day&#8217;s &#8212; working with today’s latest technology, is going to build a new arsenal to defeat the current enemy of world peace, health, and stability: COVID-19.&nbsp;<br><br>Albert was gracious enough to welcome me to Kalamazoo plant back in February.&nbsp; It’s incredible the ingenuity, the care, the safety that goes into every single dose as I toured the entire plant.&nbsp;<br><br>Most of all, when you&#8217;re there, you feel the pride every worker there feels, how &#8212; the pride they feel in what they are doing.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve been to a lot of plants.&nbsp; I have worked &#8212; I&#8217;m a big union guy.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve been doing it my whole career.&nbsp; But you could see the looks on their faces; they were proud.&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean it sincerely, they were proud of what they were doing.&nbsp; They knew what they were doing.&nbsp;<br><br>American workers will now produce vaccines to save lives of people in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean.&nbsp; People they will never meet and have never met in places they&#8217;ve never visited and probably won&#8217;t have an opportunity to, but lives saved all the same thanks to American leadership and American workers&#8217; hard work and values.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Let me close with this: This is a monumental commitment by the American people.&nbsp; As I said, we&#8217;re a nation full of people who step up at times of need to help our fellow human beings, both at home and abroad.&nbsp; We&#8217;re not perfect, but we step up.&nbsp;<br><br>But we&#8217;re not alone in this endeavor, that&#8217;s the point I want to make.&nbsp; We&#8217;re going to help lead the world out of this pandemic, working alongside our global partners.<br><br>Under the UK chairmanship of the G7, democracies of the world are posed to deliver as well.&nbsp; This U.S. contribution<br>is the foundation for additional coordinated efforts to help vaccine the world &#8212; vaccinate the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>The British government, the Prime Minister has led a strong campaign to get people vaccinated across the UK, and I’m grateful they&#8217;re making their own generous donation.<br><br>Tomorrow, the G7 nations will be announcing the full scope of our commitment &#8212; &#8220;our,&#8221; meaning the G7.&nbsp; And I want to thank all of my G7 partners for stepping up to recognize our responsibility to meet the moment.&nbsp; I’m looking forward to working with my counterparts on these efforts in the coming days and much more.<br><br>One final point I want to make clear: This is not the end of our efforts to fight COVID-19 or vaccinate the world.&nbsp; We have to turn manufacturing &#8212; we have to turn manufactured doses into shots in arms to protect people and communities.<br><br>That’s why the United States is already providing hundreds of millions in funding to support last-minute vaccination efforts, including new funding from Congress as part of the American Rescue Plan and working with programs in Latin America, Asia, and Africa.<br><br>We’re going to keep manufacturing doses, donating doses, getting “jabs” &#8212; as they say here in the UK &#8212; in arms, until the world has beaten this virus.&nbsp;<br><br>I want to thank you all.&nbsp; Now, I&#8217;d like to turn it over to my friend, the CEO and Chairman of Pfizer, Aver- &#8212; Al- &#8212; Albert Bourla. &nbsp;<br><br>Albert, it&#8217;s all yours.&nbsp; And, again, personally, thank you for stepping up.&nbsp;<br><br>MR. BOURLA:&nbsp; Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Thank you.<br><br>MR. BOURLA:&nbsp; Thank you very much.&nbsp;<br><br>Thank you, Mr. President.&nbsp; And it is, of course, a great honor to be with you today for this historic announcement.<br><br>As the G7 countries come together for this critical summit, the eyes of the world are on the leaders of these powerful nations to help solve the ongoing COVID-19 crisis.&nbsp; While great progress has been made in many developed nations, the world is now asking the G7 leaders to shoulder the responsibility to help vaccinate people in all countries.<br><br>Mr. President, I know from our conversations that we agree that every man, woman, and child on the planet, regardless of financial condition, race, religion, or geography deserve access to lifesaving COVID-19 vaccines.&nbsp;<br><br>And once again, the United States has answered the call, and we are grateful to you and your administration for your leadership in this front.<br><br>Today, we are providing 500 million doses of the Pfizer–BioNTech vaccine to the world&#8217;s poorest nations.&nbsp; This will significantly enhance our ability to meet our goal of providing 2 billion doses of the vaccine to low- and middle-income countries over the next 18 months.<br><br>Thanks to the ingenuity of so many scientists and the dedication of so many manufacturing workers, today we can see clearly the light at the end of the tunnel.&nbsp; But we still have work to do.&nbsp; And I can assure you, Mr. President, that we will be relentless in pursuing more services to end the pandemic.<br><br>Just this week, we began dosing participants aged 5 to 11 years old in a global Phase 2/3 study.&nbsp; In this respect, we continue our studies in pregnant women.<br><br>We are also closely monitoring and addressing the emerging variants, we are testing our vaccine&#8217;s response to newly arising variants, and we are coordinating with public health authorities around the world on surveillance efforts.<br><br>So far, data saw that none of the existing variant strains has escaped the protection provided by our vaccine.&nbsp; I repeat: none.&nbsp; Not one.<br><br>Still, we have built a process to develop, within 100 days, a new vaccine if needed.&nbsp; God forbid.<br><br>Our scientists are also pursuing an oral treatment against COVID-19.&nbsp; Initial indications are promising.&nbsp; And if things goes well, we could apply for approval before the end of this year.<br><br>But I wanted to finish my &#8212; by coming back to the importance of your announcement today, Mr. President.&nbsp; In a pandemic, everyone is only as protected as their neighbors &#8212; their neighbors down the street, as well as their global neighbors around the world.<br><br>Today&#8217;s announcement with the U.S. government gets us closer to our goal and significantly enhances our ability to save even more lives across the globe.<br><br>Mr. President, I want to thank you for your leadership, vision, and partnership.&nbsp; We look forward to continue to work with your administration to ensure that science wins the battle against COVID-19.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>PRESIDENT BIDEN:&nbsp; Thank you.<br><br>MR. BOURLA:&nbsp; Thank you.<br><br>PRESIDENT BIDEN:&nbsp; Thank you all.<br><br>6:46 P.M. BST</p>

<p>Today, the President of the United States and Prime Minister of the United Kingdom reaffirm their commitment to work together to realise our vision for a more peaceful and prosperous future.<br><br>Our revitalised Atlantic Charter, building on the commitments and aspirations set out eighty years ago, affirms our ongoing commitment to sustaining our enduring values and defending them against new and old challenges.&nbsp;We commit to working closely with all partners who share our democratic values and to countering the efforts of those who seek to undermine our alliances and institutions.<br><br><strong>First</strong>, we resolve to defend the principles, values, and institutions of democracy and open societies, which drive our own national strength and our alliances.&nbsp;We must ensure that democracies – starting with our own –&nbsp;can deliver on solving the critical challenges of our time.&nbsp;We will champion transparency, uphold the rule of law, and support civil society and independent media.&nbsp;We will also confront injustice and inequality and defend the inherent dignity and human rights of all individuals.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Second</strong>, we intend to strengthen the institutions, laws, and norms that sustain international co-operation to adapt them to meet the new challenges of the 21<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;century, and guard against those that would undermine them.&nbsp;We will work through the rules-based international order to tackle global challenges together;&nbsp;embrace the promise and manage the peril of emerging technologies; promote economic advancement and the dignity of work; and enable open and fair trade between nations.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Third</strong>, we remain united behind the principles of sovereignty, territorial integrity, and the peaceful resolution of disputes. We oppose interference through disinformation or other malign influences, including in elections, and reaffirm our commitment to debt transparency, sustainability and sound governance of debt relief.&nbsp;So too will we defend key principles such as freedom of navigation and overflight and other internationally lawful uses of the seas.<br><br><strong>Fourth,&nbsp;</strong>we resolve to harness and protect our innovative edge in science and technology to support our shared security and deliver jobs at home; to open new markets; to promote the development and deployment of new standards and technologies to support democratic values; to continue to invest in research into the biggest challenges facing the world; and to foster sustainable global development.<br><br><strong>Fifth,</strong>&nbsp;we affirm our shared responsibility for maintaining our collective security and international stability and resilience against the full spectrum of modern threats, including cyber threats.&nbsp;We have declared our nuclear deterrents to the defence of NATO and as long as there are nuclear weapons, NATO will remain a nuclear alliance.

<p>As President Biden travels overseas to engage with global counterparts, recent economic data reinforce that U.S. fiscal policy and vaccination progress are positioning the economy for growth and job creation. Today we learned that, since January, the four-week moving average for state unemployment insurance claims have fallen by more than 50% &#8212; from more than 834,000 to 402,500. That’s the lowest level since the pandemic began. &nbsp;This news comes as independent analysts project that economic growth in the United States will outpace growth for our peer nations and reach the fastest pace in nearly four decades.&nbsp; Earlier this week, the World Bank increased their projection for U.S. economic growth this year by 3.3% to 6.8%. The 3.3% upward revision in the United States compares to a 2.1% revision in other advanced economies. &nbsp;Another analysis last week found that the United States is the only major industrialized nation to have its growth projection through 2025 revised upward. These data underscore the leading role the U.S. is playing in building towards a global recovery.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>Today, President Biden visited the U.K. at the invitation of the Prime Minister and in advance of the G7 Summit. The President and the Prime Minister set out a global vision in a new Atlantic Charter to deepen cooperation in democracy and human rights, defence and security, science and innovation, and economic prosperity, with renewed joint efforts to tackle the challenges posed by climate change, biodiversity loss, and emerging health threats.</p>



<p><strong>DEMOCRACY, HUMAN RIGHTS, &amp; MULTILATERALISM</strong></p>



<ol><li>Building on the U.K. G7 Presidency’s focus on open societies, and looking ahead to the U.S.-hosted Summit for Democracy, the U.S. and U.K. will continue to make practical efforts to support open societies and democracy across the globe.&nbsp;We will do this by defending media freedom, advancing a free and open internet, combatting corruption, tackling disinformation, protecting civic space, advancing women’s political empowerment, protecting freedom of religion or belief, and promoting human rights of all people.&nbsp; The United Nations remains the cornerstone of the international system, and its foundational principles reflect our shared values.&nbsp; In the 75 years since the UN’s creation, international security has been increasingly challenged by threats that do not recognise borders: climate change, pandemics, famine, migration, organised crime, and terrorism. The U.K. and U.S. will work with the UN and our international partners to continue to adapt and reform the international system to tackle these evolving threats and to build back better for the 21st century, while remaining true to the universal founding principles of the UN and the core values of its Charter. We commit to promoting peaceful and inclusive societies to reduce injustice, inequality, poverty, and hunger worldwide. We carry responsibility for creating sustainable and viable conditions to global economic challenges through our commitment to the G7 Agenda and 2030 Agenda on Sustainable Development, and we will work together to address pre-existing inequities and inequalities being exacerbated by COVID-19, ensuring they no longer go unaddressed.&nbsp;The U.S. and U.K. are committed to promoting the advancement of gender&nbsp;equity and&nbsp;equality as a key pillar of foreign policy and national security, including through educating girls, empowering women socially, economically, and politically, and ending violence against women and girls.&nbsp;</li></ol>



<p><strong>DEFENCE &amp; SECURITY</strong></p>



<ol start="2"><li>We commit&nbsp;to enhance further the world’s strongest bilateral defence, security, and intelligence partnership to overcome the evolving threats of the twenty-first century. This includes&nbsp;threats and challenges associated with: cyberspace, foreign interference, harmful influence campaigns, illicit finance, violent conflict and extremism, and terrorism in all its forms. To this end, we will continue our partnership on those challenges, including working together closely on cyber security, countering&nbsp;illicit finance, and tackling all forms of terrorism by working&nbsp;together&nbsp;to address it online&nbsp;and enhance international collaboration on thwarting violent extremism that is racially, ethnically or ideologically motivated, including a range of hateful and white supremacist ideologies.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Through strong and principled leadership we will work to shape and secure the international order of the future with NATO as the bedrock of our collective defence.&nbsp;We will work together to further strengthen and modernise NATO, and increase its common funding, so the Alliance can harness the full range of military and non-military capabilities to contest existing and new threats, including malicious cyber activity and attacks that test the resiliency of our societies.&nbsp;We intend to take operational measures to modernise and integrate our armed forces, and strengthen bilateral cooperation on next generation capabilities. Last month, the U.K.’s new aircraft carrier, HMS QUEEN ELIZABETH, sailed on her first operational mission with U.S. and U.K. F-35 aircraft on board – a demonstration of the unique interoperability of our Armed Forces.&nbsp;&nbsp;As we maintain close alignment on our nuclear deterrence and modernisation programs, we reaffirm our commitment to effective arms control and nuclear security, and to the goal of a world without nuclear weapons. We will draw on our extensive diplomatic, defence, security, civil and scientific cooperation to ensure Space is a safe and secure environment for all.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li><li>We look forward to bringing into force a robust bilateral data access agreement, to be based on a mutual recognition that both countries have an appropriately high level of data protection, that allows law enforcement investigations on both sides of the Atlantic to obtain the evidence needed to bring offenders to justice, whilst maintaining rigorous privacy standards. We will work together to maintain tightly-controlled lawful access to communications content that is vital to the investigation and prosecution of serious crimes including terrorism and child abuse.&nbsp;And we will work in partnership with technology companies to do this, protecting the safety of our citizens.</li></ol>



<p><strong>SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY</strong></p>



<ol start="5"><li>We will develop a new landmark bilateral technology partnership in 2021/22.&nbsp;It will enable a new era of strategic cooperation to guarantee: the safety and security of our citizens; that we continue to lead the world in R&amp;D; wealth creation and tackling inequality; the values of liberal democracies, open societies and open markets; and that all of these are codified in and threaded throughout the design and use of technology globally We will strengthen cooperation in areas such as: ensuring the diversity, resilience and security of our critical supply chains; enabling our industries and research institutions to develop and apply existing and emerging technologies such as AI, quantum, and battery technologies; and reducing barriers to the accessibility and flow of data to support economic growth, public safety and scientific &amp; technological progress.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>We will continue to strengthen collaboration in science and technology.&nbsp;This will facilitate increased joint world-class research, as well as encourage the development of rules, norms and standards governing data sharing, technology, and the digital economy that reflect our values and principles.&nbsp;We will cooperate on the basis of openness, transparency, and reciprocity, and in hope of ensuring that our collaborative research benefits our people.&nbsp;We will combine our expertise to tackle global challenges, such as cancer, antimicrobial resistance, climate change, and pandemic preparedness. We will do this through closer coordination between the Prime Minister’s Council for Science and Technology and the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, and through closer collaboration between U.S. and U.K. senior science and technology advisers.</li></ol>



<p><strong>TRADE &amp; PROSPERITY</strong></p>



<ol start="7"><li>We commit to deepening and strengthening our vital economic and trading partnership. We commit to the rapid settlement of the Large Civil Aircraft dispute.&nbsp; Both countries recognise that trade, when done right, can support our mutual interest in sustainable and green growth, good jobs for our workers, new opportunities for our innovators and businesses, and high labour and environmental standards.&nbsp; We will therefore work closely to identify and pursue opportunities to deepen our already extensive trade relationship.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li><li>We reaffirm our commitment to spur economic regeneration and build back better in a way that benefits all communities that have experienced the pain of economic change and advances equality for all &#8211; not just in cities, but also small towns and post-industrial areas.&nbsp; Mindful of the distributional consequences of economic policy and that current economic models do not serve all equally in society or adequately tackle issues such as the climate crisis, and recognising the need for equality of opportunity, we intend to launch a new joint initiative that brings together experts, practitioners and officials to advance a new “common sense” about how the economy works and the goals it should promote; the initiative will share best practice and review the evidence around public policies to tackle structural inequalities across the economy and deliver prosperity across society.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>We are proud to welcome G7 leaders’ discussions around&nbsp;a values-driven, high-standard and&nbsp;transparent,&nbsp;infrastructure&nbsp;partnership that seeks to&nbsp;collectively mobilise private-sector capital through catalytic investments &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in low- and middle-income countries from our development finance tools. We look forward to discussing the outline of this new partnership with our G7 partners in Carbis Bay.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>We also welcome the efforts underway through the G20/OECD Inclusive Framework to address the tax challenges arising from globalisation and the digitalisation of the economy and to adopt a global minimum tax. We commit to reaching an equitable solution on the allocation of taxing rights, with market countries awarded taxing rights on at least 20% of profit exceeding a 10% margin for the largest and most profitable multinational enterprises. We will provide for appropriate coordination between the application of the new international tax rules and the removal of all Digital Services Taxes, and other relevant similar measures, on all companies. We also commit to a global minimum tax of at least 15% on a country by country basis. We agree on the importance of progressing agreement in parallel on both Pillars and look forward to reaching an agreement at the July meeting of G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors.</li></ol>



<p><strong>CLIMATE &amp; NATURE</strong></p>



<ol start="11"><li>Together we will work to: rally all countries to strengthen their climate ambitions; achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement; keep within reach the goal of limiting global average temperature rise to no more than 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels; and bend the curve of biodiversity loss by 2030.&nbsp; We will champion the best available science – particularly reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services – and welcome global partnerships, including&nbsp; the COP26 Policy Dialogue on a Transition to Sustainable Agriculture and the Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate to increase and accelerate research and development for innovation in agricultural food systems; and support a resilient transition to decarbonised economies with quality job opportunities; and make progress on climate action in a gender responsive manner.&nbsp; We underscore our commitment to achieving net zero emissions by 2050 at the latest, and call on all other countries to do likewise.&nbsp; We welcome the G7’s creation of an Industrial Decarbonisation Agenda (IDA), which will help drive innovation in, and lower costs of, the decarbonisation of heavy industrial sectors around the world.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li><li>We are committed to achieving an ambitious outcome at COP26 and to the collective developed country goal of mobilising $100 billion annually through to 2025 from a wide variety of public and private sources in the context of meaningful mitigation actions and transparency on implementation.&nbsp; We are both increasing our climate finance from 2020, including for adaptation, and are continuing to pursue additional opportunities to increase climate finance mobilisation.&nbsp; We intend to provide support to countries to enable adaptation, and address the effects of climate impacts, including through finance for nature-based solutions, and by scaling up disaster risk-management, including through the Risk-Informed Early Action Partnership. We are committed to mainstreaming nature across all sectors and into economic decision-making.&nbsp;&nbsp; We also commit to working even more closely together on forests, including through the Forest Agriculture, and Commodity Trade (FACT) Dialogue, the ocean, and finance for nature to conserve, protect and restore natural ecosystems including by championing an ambitious post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Recognising the impact that energy has on our national security, economy, net-zero ambitions, and shared prosperity, we are launching a new ‘Strategic Energy Dialogue’, led by the U.K. Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy and the U.S. Department of Energy. This dialogue aims to deepen our cooperation in areas such as the development and deployment of innovative, clean energy technologies, industrial decarbonisation, nuclear energy, energy security and resilience, joint priorities in multilateral energy forums, and shared science, research, and innovation cooperation.</li></ol>



<p><strong>HEALTH</strong></p>



<ol start="14"><li>We are determined to work together to overcome the current pandemic, which has reversed progress on improving the human condition, and to be better prepared in the future.&nbsp; Reflecting our shared strength in science and technology, we commit to enhancing our cooperation on tackling variants of concern and emerging infectious disease threats with pandemic or epidemic potential. This will be underpinned by collaboration between the new U.K. Health Security Agency (U.K.HSA) Centre for Pandemic Preparedness and the new U.S. National Center for Epidemic Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics.&nbsp; Our collective strength in science will allow us to: scale up surveillance and genomic sequencing capacity, as well as variant assessment capabilities; adopt a One Health approach to account for animal health, and zoonotic and environmental risk; and support others without these capabilities.&nbsp; We welcome the plan to establish an integrated global surveillance system &#8211; the Global Pandemic Radar &#8211; and commit to working with the WHO and other partners to take this forward. Enhancing global surveillance is critical to achieving our collective ambition to deliver safe, effective and affordable vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics within 100 days of a future pandemic threat being identified.&nbsp; We are committed to working together with fellow G7 chief scientists to drive progress toward the bold 100 day ambition and report back to G7 leaders on next steps later this year.&nbsp; We will strengthen collaboration on G7 action on clinical trials for vaccines and therapeutics, through more coordinated research agendas and better sharing of data and results.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li><li>We look forward to normalising two-way travel between our two countries.&nbsp; We will establish a joint U.K.-U.S. Experts’ Working Group, which will share expertise and provide recommendations to leaders on the return of safe and sustainable international travel, demonstrating the commitment of both countries to tackle COVID-19 together.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>We will work together to help increase global vaccine supply through investments in manufacturing of safe and effective vaccines and the materials needed to produce them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will promote the timely availability of vaccines, key components and equipment by encouraging bilateral trade and investment and avoiding export restrictions or other supply chain disruption. We will work together to strengthen multilateral vaccine initiatives, in particular COVAX and its partner organisations CEPI, Gavi, UNICEF and WHO. We will support resource mobilisation for partner financing needs, and work with international financial institutions to build delivery capacity in-country and develop long term, sustainable financing models to increase pandemic preparedness and response and global health security. To this end, the U.K. and U.S. will work together with likeminded countries to explore options for a new sustainable, catalytic health security financing mechanism. We will bring together government and industry to encourage further investment to tackle COVID-19 and prepare for the next health security threat, including by strengthening preparedness and resilience, increasing R&amp;D spending, and tackling new variants. We will continue to help allies and partners accelerate implementation of, and compliance with, the International Health Regulations (IHR). To move towards this goal, we will both strive to promote and advance the Global Health Security Agenda and its bold 2024 target, including through capacity building to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease threats.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>The U.K. and U.S. recognise the central importance of the WHO in global health security. The U.K. and the U.S. will work together and with like-minded Member States to implement the WHO strengthening resolution adopted at the World Health Assembly in May 2021. We will also support a timely, transparent and evidence-based independent process for the next phase of the WHO-convened COVID-19 origins study, including in China, and for investigating outbreaks of unknown origin in the future. We will take account of the recommendations of the International Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response as we work together to learn the lessons from the pandemic and strengthen future preparedness.&nbsp; We commit to advancing critical areas in global health, including strengthening health systems and building regional and country capacity to better withstand future shocks; expanding the availability, accessibility, and quality of essential health services among the world’s most vulnerable, marginalized, and inadequately-served; and prioritizing maternal, neonatal and child health, nutrition, malaria, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS.&nbsp; We will also establish an institution-to-institution partnership to strengthen our approach to reducing health inequalities.&nbsp;&nbsp; We will elevate our partnership on Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights advancing our renewed commitment throughout the 76<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;United Nations General Assembly. .&nbsp; We call on regional, local and national actors to support these efforts.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>We will convene the first U.S.-U.K. Bilateral Cancer Summit and bring together researchers, patients, and other stakeholders to share ideas and identify opportunities for collaboration to accelerate advances in lifesaving approaches to cancer, which remains a leading cause of death worldwide.</li></ol>



<p><strong>COMMITMENT TO NORTHERN IRELAND</strong></p>



<ol start="19"><li>Northern Ireland has taken huge strides forward since its courageous leaders put reconciliation and progress before violence and division 23 years ago. We are proud of the achievements of the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement, and we remain fully committed to its three strand approach, that: established the democratic institutions in Northern Ireland; provided for consultation, co-operation and action across the island of Ireland; and created structures for British-Irish engagement.&nbsp;It took a deep partnership between the U.K., Ireland, and the U.S. to support the people of Northern Ireland in bringing the Troubles to an end, and it will take a continued and ongoing partnership to advance and safeguard Northern Ireland’s stability and prosperity into the future.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Today, the U.K. and U.S. reaffirm their commitment to working closely with all parties to the Agreement to protect its delicate balance and realise its vision for reconciliation, consent, equality, respect for rights, and parity of esteem. Unlocking Northern Ireland’s tremendous potential is a vital part of safeguarding the stability created by the Agreement, and the U.K. and the U.S. will continue working together towards that shared goal.</li></ol>
