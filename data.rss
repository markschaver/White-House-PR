<p class="has-text-align-center">Muqata’a Presidential Compound<br>Bethlehem, West Bank</p>



<p>1:24 P.M. EEST</p>



<p>PRESIDENT ABBAS:  (As interpreted.)  Formidable President Biden, we welcome you as a dear guest of Palestine, in the city of Bethlehem, the cradle of our Lord Jesus Christ, on your official visit, which expresses your interest in achieving peace in the land of peace.</p>



<p>And today&#8217;s meeting, our meeting, was an opportunity to discuss consolidating our military relations between the countries and peoples, and to review what the U.S. can contribute to prepare the atmosphere for a political horizon for a just, comprehensive, durable peace.</p>



<p>We have stressed to Mr. President Biden on the importance of reestablishing the foundations upon which the peace process was based &#8212; that is based on the international legitimacy resolutions and on the basis of the two-state solution along the 1967 borders.</p>



<p>Mr. President, after 74 years of the Nakba displacement and occupation, isn&#8217;t it not the time for this occupation to end and for our steadfast people, again, to gain their freedom and independence, and for the hopes of our young men and women, whom we cherish and trust their creativity, to achieve a promising future without occupation?</p>



<p>In this regard, we say that the key to peace and security in our region begins with recognizing state of Palestine and enabling the Palestinian people to obtain their legitimate rights in accordance with international legitimacy resolutions, and ending all the permanent status issues, including the Palestinian refugees issue.</p>



<p>And the way to that begins with ending the Israeli occupation of our land, the land of state of Palestine, with East Jerusalem as its capital, on the 1967 borders.</p>



<p>Mr. President, we have respected the resolutions of international legitimacy and signed agreements, and we have committed ourselves to renouncing violence and fighting terrorism in our region and the world.</p>



<p>We look forward to steps from the U.S. administration to strengthen bilateral relations by reopening the U.S. consulate in East Jerusalem, removing the PLO from the U.S. terrorist list. We are not terrorists. And also, we look forward to reopening PLO office in Washington. And we are ready to work within the framework of partnership and cooperation in order to remove any obstacles to achieving that.</p>



<p>Mr. President, we look forward to the efforts of your administration to turn the page on the Israeli occupation of our land and the acts of racial discrimination, apartheid against our people; and to stop unilateral actions that undermine the two-state solution.</p>



<p>We look forward to these efforts to stop settlement and settler violence; and respect of the historical situation in the Islamic and Christian holy sites and the Hashemite custodianship; and stopping the expulsion of Palestinians, demolishing houses, homes, and storming the cities, villages, and camps; and stopping the daily killing and arrests on daily basis; and holding the killers of the martyr journalist, Shireen Abu Akleh &#8212; they need to be held accountable.</p>



<p>Because the continuation of all of that will lead to escalation on the one hand and loss of hope for a better tomorrow on the other.</p>



<p>Mr. President, if Israel wants to be a compliant state, it cannot continue to act as a state above law. And this calls for Israel to end its occupation of the land of state of Palestine with East Jerusalem as its capital on the 1967 borders.</p>



<p>Only then, Israel will be accepted to live in peace, security, and good neighborhood with the countries and peoples of the region based on the Arab Peace Initiative. The opportunity for the two-state solution on the 1967 borders may be available today only, but we don’t know what will happen later.</p>



<p>Therefore, I take this opportunity on the occasion of the visit of Your Excellency to the region to say that I extend my hand to the leaders of Israel to make peace for the (inaudible). And this has happened much before. Before Oslo Accords, we have been extending our hands for peace with all the Israeli leaders for a better future for the future generations and for all the peoples of the region.</p>



<p>Mr. President, we welcome you again. And our confidence in you and your administration is very great. And we assure you of our readiness to work with you, hand in hand, in order to achieve comprehensive and just peace based on international legitimacy and the Arab Peace Initiative and the signed agreements between us and Israel.</p>



<p>There are agreements that we need to respect in a way &#8212; in a manner that guarantees security, peace, stability, and lasting prosperity for all the countries in the region.</p>



<p>Mr. President, peace begins with Palestine and Jerusalem. From here, peace starts. We extend our hands for peace and to work with you, Mr. President, to achieve it.</p>



<p>Peace be upon you. (In Arabic.) Thank you.</p>



<p>PRESIDENT BIDEN: Mr. President, President Abbas, thank you very much and to your colleagues with whom I had the opportunity to meet as well.</p>



<p>And it’s good to see you again, my friend. We’ve known each other for a long time. And I’m very proud to be with you today as President of the United States. And I can &#8212; we can count ourselves among the earliest supporters of a two-state solution.</p>



<p>As I stand with you today, now as President of the United States, my commitment to that goal of a two-state solution has not changed in all these years.</p>



<p>Two states along the 1967 lines, where mutually agreed-to swaps, remain the best way to achieve equal measure of security, prosperity, freedom, and democracy for the Palestinians as well as Israelis.</p>



<p>The Palestinian people deserve a state of their own that’s independent, sovereign, viable, and contiguous. Two states for two peoples, both of whom have deep and ancient roots in this land, living side by side in peace and security. Both states fully respecting the equal rights of the other citizens. Both peoples enjoying equal measure of freedom and dignity. That’s what this is fundamentally all about.</p>



<p>Every person has a right to be treated with dignity. It’s simply basic. I know that the goal of the two states seems so far away while indignities like restrictions on movement and travel or the daily worry of your children’s safety are real and they are immediate.</p>



<p>The Pales- &#8212; the Palestinian people are hurting now. You feel &#8212; you can just feel it, your grief and frustration. In the United States, we can feel it.</p>



<p>But we’ve never give up on the work of peace. You know, there must be a political horizon that the Palestinian people can actually see or at least feel. We can’t allow the hopelessness to steal away the future that so many have worked toward for so long.</p>



<p>So even if the ground is not ripe at this moment to restart negotiations, the United States and my administration will not give up on trying to bring the Palestinians and Israelis and both sides closer together.</p>



<p>I do believe that in this moment when Israel is improving relations with its neighbors throughout the region, we can harness that same momentum to reinvigorate the peace process between the Palestinian people and the Israelis.</p>



<p>I recognize how hard all these challenges must be and will be to work through. Above all, there must be an end to the violence that has devastated too many families.</p>



<p>It’s heart-wrenching that so many Palestinians and Israelis have lost their life just this year. And the United States has suffered loss as well, including the killing of Shireen Abu Alkeh &#8212; Alkehli [Akleh].</p>



<p>And she was an American &#8212; an American citizen and a proud Palestinian. And she was performing very vital work on an independent media and vital work of democracy.</p>



<p>Her death is an enormous loss to the essential work of sharing with the world the story of the Palestinian people.</p>



<p>I hope that her legacy &#8212; her legacy will inspire more young people to carry on her work of reporting the truth and telling stories that are too often overlooked.</p>



<p>The United States will continue to insist on a full and transparent accounting of her death, and we will continue to stand up for media freedom everywhere in the world.</p>



<p>President Abbas, in the past, we met in Ramallah, but today, in the Palestinian city of Bethlehem, a place of enormous<br>significance in my faith as well &#8212; the birthplace of Jesus Christ.</p>



<p>This is the city that lives in the hearts of millions of Christians and is a reminder of God’s great gift to the world and our renewed and redemption in Christ.</p>



<p>Muslim and Jews also have an intense and deep connection to this land, particularly in Jerusalem.</p>



<p>Jerusalem is central to the national visions of both Palestinians and Israelis &#8212; to your histories, to your faiths, to your futures.</p>



<p>Jerusalem must be a city for all its people &#8212; its holy sites preserving the status quo, with the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan continuing to serve as custodian.</p>



<p>And throughout this Holy Land, which is filled with so many places of meaning and significance to Muslims, Christians, and Jews, we must all be free to practice our faiths in peace, in safety, and in dignity.</p>



<p>We cannot wait for a peace agreement to be reached or for every issue to be resolved to deliver on the needs of the Palestinian people that exist today, as I speak.</p>



<p>The best way to feed the flame of hope is to demonstrate that things can be better. And, President Abbas, the United States is a partner in this work to improve the day-to-day lives of the Palestinian people.</p>



<p>That’s why, when I came to office, I reserved the policy &#8212; I reversed the policies of my predecessor and resumed aid to the Palestinians &#8212; more than a half a billion dollars in [since] 2021.</p>



<p>That’s support for the economic development of the Palestinian people, to strengthen Palestinian security, to provide food for people to eat, to respond to the pandemic, including donating more than one million doses of COVID-19 [vaccine] to the West Bank and Gaza.</p>



<p>It also includes more than $400 million in humanitarian assistance to Palestinian refugees through the United [Nations] Relief and Works Agency &#8212; the UNRWA.</p>



<p>And today, I’m announcing the United States is going to provide an additional $200 million to the UNRWA so it can continue its vital work of helping the most vulnerable Palestinians, especially Palestinian children.</p>



<p>Earlier this month, and I &#8212; we decided &#8212; and this morning, I announced an additional $100 million in support of healthcare services for Palestinians throughout East Jerusalem Hospital Network.</p>



<p>We were &#8212; we were engaging with Israel around ways<br>to spur greater Palestinian economic growth, including by implementing 4G mobile networks, increasing the supply of renewable energy, improving freedom of movement for Palestinians, both people and goods.</p>



<p>These are the kinds of issues that progress can make life better for people right away, and we should be about it right away.</p>



<p>And the Palestinian Authority has important work to do as well, if you don’t mind my saying.</p>



<p>Now is the time to strengthen Palestinian institutions, to improve governance, transparency, and accountability.</p>



<p>All of this work is critical. And it will help build a society that can support a successful, democratic future, and a future Palestinian state. And the United States will work with you, President Abbas, at every step.</p>



<p>So thank you again for welcoming me and my delegation &#8212; the Secretary of State, National Security Advisor, and others &#8212; to visit with you.</p>



<p>I hope our visit is the start of a new and reinvigorated dialogue between the Palestinian Authority, the United States &#8212; and between the Palestinian &#8212; countries and counties throughout &#8212; and countries throughout the region, including Israel.</p>



<p>So let’s work together to show the people of the region, especially young people &#8212; young people &#8212; that the future can be better than it is today.</p>



<p>I thank you all very much. And may God protect us all. Thank you, Mr. President.</p>

<p>Today, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. met with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. President Biden reaffirmed the enduring ties between the Palestinian and American peoples and underscored his commitment to a two-state solution on the 1967 lines with land swaps mutually agreed by the Israelis and Palestinians. He also highlighted the importance of direct negotiations leading to an independent, sovereign, viable, and contiguous Palestinian state alongside the State of Israel, both enjoying secure and recognized borders, allowing the two peoples to live side-by-side in peace and security.</p>



<p>In the meeting, President Biden highlighted a number of initiatives the United States is undertaking to support the Palestinian people. President Biden also discussed encouraging regional governments and the international community to assist the Palestinian people.</p>



<p>The leaders reaffirmed that both Palestinians and Israelis deserve to enjoy equal measures of freedom, security, prosperity, and democracy. President Biden emphasized his belief that the Palestinian people deserve to live lives of dignity and opportunity; to move and travel freely; to feel secure in their communities; and to give hope to their children that they will one day enjoy the same freedom and self-determination of their neighbors.</p>



<p>President Biden reiterated the importance of fostering a political horizon, and noted the United States stands ready to work with Israelis, Palestinians, and regional stakeholders toward that goal. As he had relayed to Israeli leaders, President Biden conveyed to President Abbas that in order to create the conditions for negotiations, it was important for both parties to avoid unilateral measures.</p>



<p>President Biden reiterated the U.S. position that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel, and that it continues to be the policy of the United States that the specific boundaries of sovereignty in Jerusalem must be resolved through final status negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians. He further reaffirmed the need to preserve the historic status quo at the holy sites in Jerusalem, recognizing the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan’s crucial role as custodian.</p>

<p>Saudi Arabia’s historic decision to open its airspace for all civilian planes, including those flying to and from Israel, is an important step towards building a more integrated and stable Middle East region.  While this opening has long been discussed, now, thanks to months of steady diplomacy between my Administration and Saudi Arabia, it is finally a reality. Today, I will be the first president of the United States to fly from Israel to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. As we mark this important moment, Saudi Arabia’s decision can help build momentum toward Israel’s further integration into the region, including with Saudi Arabia. I will do all that I can, through direct diplomacy and leader-to-leader engagement, to keep advancing this groundbreaking process.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>Tomorrow, President Biden will announce a number of initiatives to support the Palestinian people by:</p>



<ul><li>Improving access to health care and technology;</li><li>Rolling out long overdue 4G digital connectivity to both Gaza and the West Bank;</li><li>Bolstering economic growth;</li><li>Providing critical services for Palestinian refugees;</li><li>Reducing food insecurity;</li><li>Fostering people-to-people dialogue to support peace.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>President Biden will also announce new contributions totaling $316 million to support the Palestinian people.&nbsp;This is on top of the more than half a billion dollars the United States has provided to the Palestinian people since the Biden Administration restored much needed funding to the Palestinians.</p>



<p><strong>Improve Healthcare Access for Palestinians</strong></p>



<ul><li>During his visit to the Augusta Victoria Hospital in East Jerusalem, the President will announce the United States intends to provide a new multi-year U.S. contribution of up to $100 million for the East Jerusalem Hospital Network (EJHN), subject to congressional approval.&nbsp; The EJHN is a grouping of six hospitals in East Jerusalem providing specialized services including oncology, dialysis, neo-natal intensive care, and specialized maternity, ophthalmology, and emergency services to 50,000 patients from East Jerusalem, the West Bank, and Gaza annually.&nbsp; The funding is provided by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and paired with health system and hospital reforms.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Bolstering the Digital Economy to Improve Palestinian Economic Growth</strong></p>



<ul><li>To boost Palestinian businesses and improve connectivity for Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, Israel has committed to speeding up the long overdue transformation of 3G to 4G in the West Bank and afterwards 2G to 4G in Gaza.&nbsp; Israeli and Palestinian teams will work together immediately to start the technological surveys, with an aim to roll out an advanced infrastructure for 4G by the end of 2023.&nbsp; This commitment will accelerate digital transformation and foster a more well-connected Palestinian economy.&nbsp; It will also generate jobs, increase productivity, and increase online operations in the health and education sectors.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Improve the Travel Experience from the West Bank to Jordan</strong></p>



<ul><li>President Biden supports creating a more autonomous, efficient, and reliable Palestinian experience of traveling abroad.&nbsp; He will announce that Israel is prepared to take measures to increase efficiency and accessibility to the Allenby Bridge for the benefit of Palestinians.&nbsp; In order to upgrade facilities, Israel has agreed to enable access 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, by September 30, 2022.&nbsp; A working group will assess several measures including the use of biometric passports and will complete its assessments within the next month and discuss conclusions with U.S. partners.&nbsp; In addition, the working group will consider steps to establish Palestinian Authority presence on Allenby Bridge while maintaining Israel&#8217;s security considerations.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Support Critical Services for Palestinian Refugees</strong></p>



<ul><li>The United States believes that Palestinian refugees deserve to live in dignity, to see their basic needs addressed, and to have hope for the future.&nbsp; President Biden will announce an additional $201 million for the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) to continue delivering critical services to Palestinian refugees in the West Bank, Gaza, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria.&nbsp; UNRWA’s comprehensive services remain a lifeline to millions of vulnerable Palestinians – consistent with its mandate to provide assistance and protection to Palestinian refugees pending a just and lasting solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.&nbsp; These services directly contribute to maintaining regional stability, which is beneficial to the interests of the United States, our allies, and our partners.&nbsp; This contribution cements the United States’ status as UNRWA’s largest donor. &nbsp;These new funds bring the total United States assistance to UNRWA during the Biden Administration to more than $618 million. &nbsp;The United States is committed to supporting UNRWA to provide the most effective and efficient assistance possible and to continue to improve its operations and delivery. &nbsp;UNRWA’s work must be done while fully respecting the UN principles of neutrality, tolerance, human rights, equity, and non-discrimination. &nbsp;</li></ul>



<p><strong>Re-Launching Israeli-Palestinian Economic Discussions and Promoting Steps to Improve Lives</strong></p>



<ul><li>President Biden will share with President Abbas that Israel intends to convene the Joint Economic Committee with the Palestinians.&nbsp; Restarting discussions through the Joint Economic Committee has been a longstanding request of the Palestinian Authority. &nbsp;The committee last met in 2009 and is the mandated entity under the Oslo Accords for the Israeli government and Palestinian Authority to meet to discuss joint economic issues, including wastewater, clean energy, and other measures that impact Palestinian lives in the West Bank.&nbsp; President Biden also announced that Israel agreed to increase the number of permits for Palestinians in Gaza to work and do business in Israel to 15,500.&nbsp; The Biden Administration strongly supports increased access and movement for Palestinians, and this is a positive step toward that goal.&nbsp; Additionally, Israel agreed to approve the registration of 5,500 previously unregistered Palestinians on the Palestinian Population Register.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Ensure Food Security for Palestinians</strong></p>



<ul><li>In response to rising food insecurity for Palestinians in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, President Biden will announce that the United States is providing $15 million in additional humanitarian assistance for vulnerable Palestinians.&nbsp; Via funding to the UN World Food Program and two non-governmental organizations, the United States is providing electronic food vouchers, multipurpose cash assistance, and emergency livelihoods support, helping more than 210,000 food-insecure people meet their household food needs in coming months.&nbsp; This funding is part of the pledge of additional U.S. government resources that President Biden made at the G7 Leaders’ Summit in Germany in late June to protect the world’s most vulnerable populations from the escalating global food security crisis.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Fostering People-to-People Ties</strong></p>



<ul><li>To build grassroots support for peace through an eventual negotiated two-state solution, President Biden will announce two new grants under the Nita M. Lowey Middle East Partnership for Peace Act (MEPPA).&nbsp; MEPPA authorizes up to $250 million dollars over five years to implement projects led by both Israelis and Palestinians establishing the environment necessary to achieve long term peace.&nbsp; The first new grant, for $2.21 million to the Peres Center for Peace, will support collaboration and professional exchanges between the Palestinian and Israeli health sectors as they work to build mutual trust, confidence, and understanding between the two societies.&nbsp; The second new grant, for $5 million to AppleSeeds, will provide young Palestinian and Israeli professionals the opportunity to work together and learn critical technology and leadership. For more information on these and other activities under MEPPA please visit <a href="https://www.usaid.gov/west-bank-and-gaza/meppa">https://www.usaid.gov/west-bank-and-gaza/meppa</a>.</li></ul>

<p>Today, Jennifer Klein, White House Gender Policy Council Director, and Julie Chavez Rodriguez, White House Intergovernmental Affairs Director, met with women and allied mayors from across the country to discuss reproductive rights.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From safeguarding public health to overseeing critical infrastructure, mayors lead and implement policies closest to home. As abortion bans go into effect in states across the country, compromising women’s access to critical reproductive health care services,&nbsp;mayors can play an important role in their communities, including by supporting public education and outreach on reproductive health care, supporting the funding of services,&nbsp;sharing accurate information, and taking additional actions to protect abortion access and promote safety.</p>



<p>On June 30, the Women Mayors Network released a&nbsp;<a href="https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Furldefense.com%2Fv3%2F__https%3A%2Fwww.womenmayorsnetwork.org%2Fabortionaccessletter2%2F__%3B!!AQdq3sQhfUj4q8uUguY!iz9lbb4k2qPMql2vQSzaIkbXehLFnIQSVFuYJ2uZbuErKQuqz-Pff91Bk8qG5HwgiLZ7mKsWjHcBjY1K2BwAE2_hnuJ7A_G_IKfr%24&amp;data=05%7C01%7CZMiller%40ap.org%7C928d3918aa964d68d4d908da65a61411%7Ce442e1abfd6b4ba3abf3b020eb50df37%7C1%7C0%7C637934061221694690%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=CJ8Y7dIJBu23JiIBcCBL3skploii%2BYuIOtLNmO2Vm7g%3D&amp;reserved=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">letter</a>&nbsp;from more than 65 women mayors and additional male allies in response to the Supreme Court’s decision in&nbsp;<em>Dobbs v. Jackson</em>&nbsp;<em>Women’s Health Organization.&nbsp;</em>In the letter, the mayors commit to “actions that safeguard our clinics and our residents who are seeking abortion services or helping others do so and funding services and logistical support whenever possible, and to organize with residents and activists to support actions that expand access to abortion care.”</p>



<p>In the meeting, which was co-hosted by the Women Mayors Network, mayors shared what they are seeing and hearing on the ground as patients from states that ban abortion travel to seek care. The mayors also discussed actions they have taken to support reproductive rights, as well as key messaging and outreach strategies. White House Senior Officials thanked the mayors for their leadership and reinforced the Administration’s commitment&nbsp;to working together to protect access to abortion.</p>

<p>President Biden welcomes and commends the historic decision by the leadership of Saudi Arabia to open Saudi airspace to all civilian carriers without discrimination, a decision that includes flights to and from Israel. This decision is the result of the President’s persistent and principled diplomacy with Saudi Arabia over many months, culminating in his visit today. This decision paves the way for a more integrated, stable, and secure Middle East region, which is vital for the security and prosperity of the United States and the American people, and for the security and prosperity of Israel. The President will have more to say on this breakthrough later today, as we embark on his historic flight directly from Israel to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>MacDill Air Force Base<br><em>Tampa, Florida</em></em></p>



<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Well, good afternoon, everyone.&nbsp; I am very much looking forward to our discussion.&nbsp; And I&#8217;m very pleased to be here on the ground with you, who have been doing extraordinary work on so many levels.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>I was &#8212; all that I &#8212; that I admire about the service, the dedication, the discipline, and the skill that our men and women apply to this work was reinforced with the quick visit that I just had out in the hangar.&nbsp; And so, I want to thank everyone here for what you do every day.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>We are here to highlight and to &#8212; to uplift with praise the work of CENTCOM and SOCOM.&nbsp; This work is critical to our national security.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>As we know, the President is overseas right now in the Middle East.&nbsp; And there is so much about what happens through the leadership here on the ground that allows us to reinforce and strengthen our partnerships around the globe and reinforces our commitment to international rules and norms and America’s willingness and preparedness to uphold and defend those international rules and norms.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So, I&#8217;m here to speak with these leaders &#8212; in particular, General Kurilla and General Clarke.&nbsp; And I want to thank you both for hosting us today.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The United States Military, without any question certainly in my mind or the President&#8217;s mind and in the mind of the American people, is the strongest and the best fighting force in the world.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>When you look at the work that happens just right here, you will see extraordinary work that is about dedication, discipline, the building and strengthening of skills, and just sheer commitment to defending our country and the principles upon which we were founded.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And so, I&#8217;m here to talk with the leaders here to discuss the missions that are currently active around the globe and to talk with them about what might be necessary in terms of the additional support and resources that they need to do their job and complete their mission.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;I also am here to express gratitude not only to the service members but to their families.&nbsp; In particular, the folks who work out of CENTCOM and SOCOM are supported by wonderful families who dedicate so much of their lives to allow their family member to serve as they do for our country.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So I am here to praise, again, the work that is being done by all of these folks.&nbsp; I also want to mention that partic- &#8212; in particular, regarding the work of CENTCOM, President Biden, being in the Middle East, is there to also make sure that we are clear about the role and the responsibility the United States plays in that region of the world, with an emphasis on many points, including our enduring relationship in support of our allies and friends and partners in Israel.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>His visit is also about emphasizing the work that is happening through CENTCOM that strengthens the relationships that we have in that region of the world.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>CENTCOM’s work also directly benefits the American people, in addition to ensuring that all of the values we care about in terms of our security are upheld.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>CENTCOM’s work includes protecting commercial shipping lanes and energy resources that Americans rely on and &#8212; in this moment when we know that commerce and the &#8212; the active ability of us to engage in commerce is something that directly affects the American people where they live and how they live.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Regarding SOCOM, this year we celebrate the 30th &#8212; 35th, excuse me, anniversary of its founding.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>PARTICIPANT:&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; (Laughter.)<br>&nbsp;<br>And we call the Special Operations Forces our “quiet professionals” for a reason.&nbsp; They do big work.&nbsp; They never look for praise or acknowledgement.&nbsp; But the work they do we take for granted.&nbsp; Sometimes we don&#8217;t see, but we surely benefit from it.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And so, I&#8217;m here to also talk about the work that is happening in the frontlines on our continued fight against terrorism around the world and the work that SOCOM does to ensure that America&#8217;s interests are well served, including at this moment during Russia&#8217;s unprovoked aggression and the war in Ukraine, where the men and women of this division have been doing the work that they do around the globe, including training the forces that are the forces of our allies and, in particular, the Ukrainians in their fight to preserve their sovereignty and territorial integrity.<br>&nbsp;<br>So together, CENTCOM and SOCOM advance our national security interests and defend and strengthen our international rules-based order.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And with that, I will conclude by saying to all here how much we appreciate you every day.&nbsp; I mentioned to the folks that I was with in the hangar: We talk about you guys all the time when we&#8217;re sitting in the Situation Room or in the Oval Office, talking about America&#8217;s responsibility not only to the citizens of our country but to our friends and allies around the world.&nbsp; We talk about you, because we could not follow through on anything that we do in the context of those relationships and priorities were it not for what you all are doing here on the ground.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So, thank you.&nbsp; And your mission remains critically important to the President, to me, and to our country.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And with that, I thank the press.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll see you all later.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; END<br>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Today, July 14, 2022, Vice President Kamala Harris convened Florida state legislators who are fighting on the frontlines to protect reproductive rights. The Vice President was joined by Secretary of Health and Human Services Xavier Becerra for the meeting which took place in Orlando, Florida. Today’s convening follows engagements about reproductive rights that the Vice President held with health care providers, faith leaders, constitutional law and privacy experts, advocates, State Attorneys General, and other state legislators from across the country.<br>&nbsp;<br>During the meeting, the Vice President conveyed the Administration’s commitment to protecting access to reproductive health care, including abortion access, and she encouraged the legislators to continue fighting to protect reproductive rights in Florida.&nbsp;She emphasized that the government should not interfere with the right of every American to make the most intimate decisions about “heart and home” – including reproductive health care access. The Vice President reiterated the Administration’s commitment to partnering with elected leaders at the local, state, and federal level to protect reproductive health care.&nbsp;The Vice President discussed actions the Administration is taking to defend health care access, and&nbsp;she applauded the state legislators for their work defending abortion access in Florida.<br><br>The state legislative leaders shared what is happening in Florida as extremist legislators are fighting to further limit reproductive health care access. Florida currently has a 15 week ban on abortion, with no exception for rape or incest. The law was signed into law by Governor DeSantis in April and went into effect on July 1, 2022. Participants shared stories of patients who have experienced the harmful impact of Florida’s abortion restrictions, noting that every person deserves access to comprehensive health care. The legislators conveyed how the impact of abortion bans across other southern states is overwhelming the health systems in Florida. They also discussed how in states like Florida, the extremist legislators who are attacking reproductive rights are also restricting LGBTQI+ rights and voting rights. The Vice President recognized the importance of building coalitions to defend rights and freedoms. The Vice President and the state leaders reaffirmed their commitment to working together to protect reproductive rights for all women across the state of Florida and our nation.<br>&nbsp;<br>In attendance were the following:</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">REMARKS AS PREPARED</p>



<p>Thank you, Vivian.&nbsp; I’m grateful to you, Cecilia, and everyone at the Aspen Institute for spotlighting President Biden’s competition agenda.&nbsp; It’s great to be here.</p>



<p>A little over a year ago, President Biden issued a landmark Executive Order on Competition. &nbsp;That day, he articulated both the opportunity and the challenge. &nbsp;“The heart of American capitalism,” the President explained, “is a simple idea: open and fair competition.” &nbsp;But he also warned that “capitalism without competition isn’t capitalism; it’s exploitation.”<a href="#_ftn1" id="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>



<p>This isn’t the first time an American President has trained his focus on competition. &nbsp;Theodore Roosevelt confronted an economy with industry after industry dominated by trusts. &nbsp;Franklin Roosevelt faced a highly cartelized economy struggling to recover from the Great Depression.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Both Roosevelts transformed antitrust enforcement in their time and set precedents for rising to this challenge on behalf of the American people. &nbsp;And both Roosevelts understood something important: antitrust policy doesn’t operate in a vacuum; it is interwoven with the fabric of the economy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Consider one example. &nbsp;Teddy Roosevelt is of course remembered for “trust-busting”—in particular against railroads,<a href="#_ftn2" id="_ftnref2">[2]</a> meatpackers,<a href="#_ftn3" id="_ftnref3">[3]</a> and Standard Oil<a href="#_ftn4" id="_ftnref4">[4]</a> in the courts. &nbsp;But his insight was broader: not only was it necessary to vigorously enforce antitrust laws, but it was also critical to reshape the regulatory framework—to work with Congress and to create rules of the road (or rules of the rail) that kept these early common carriers from using their market position to privilege incumbents and discriminate against new entrants.<a href="#_ftn5" id="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>



<p>That basic insight—using tools from across the government to implement <em>structural </em>changes to enhance competition—is more relevant than ever today. &nbsp;We face an economy today with challenges impossible for the Roosevelts to imagine. &nbsp;But there are familiar echoes. &nbsp;</p>



<p>For President Biden, a strong competition policy is an indispensable part of an economic strategy for the twenty-first century. &nbsp;He believes driving structural changes that promote competition across the economy holds the prospect of generating more innovation, productivity, and opportunity in America, while lowering prices for consumers and raising wages for workers.</p>



<p>For decades, the competitive attributes of our economy have been atrophying. &nbsp;Most industries have become less competitive. &nbsp;Both consumers and workers have been left with fewer options.&nbsp;<br><br></p>



<p>Reversing these trends is a significant task. It amounts to turning around the proverbial aircraft carrier. &nbsp;But now, one year in, we can begin to see the ship turning in the right direction. &nbsp;We’ve already delivered on many key promises, with more announcements coming soon. &nbsp;And under the direction of the President’s executive order—and through our White House Competition Council—we are changing how the government approaches competition policy, and indeed economic policy. &nbsp;If done right, these changes will pay dividends for years to come as we continue the hard work of shifting course.</p>



<p>Today, I’d like to address the competition challenges we face, the progress we’ve made during the last year, and the work that lies ahead.&nbsp;</p>



<ol type="I"><li><strong>Today’s Competition Challenges</strong></li></ol>



<p>Let’s talk, first, about the competition challenges we’re confronting.</p>



<p>A growing body of academic research has demonstrated our economy is suffering from a loss of competition and rising corporate concentration. &nbsp;Six years ago, my colleagues at the Council of Economic Advisers sounded the alarm around what they described as “increasing industry concentration, increasing rents accruing to a few firms, and lower levels of firm entry and labor market mobility.”<a href="#_ftn6" id="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>



<p>Those concerns emanated from stark realities: Over the prior decades, concentration had increased in more than three-quarters of U.S. industries,<a href="#_ftn7" id="_ftnref7">[7]</a> while both investment and labor’s share of the economy decreased.<a href="#_ftn8" id="_ftnref8">[8]</a>&nbsp; This occurred during a period of both low productivity growth and rising inequality.<a href="#_ftn9" id="_ftnref9">[9]</a></p>



<p>The core problem involves what economists call excessive market power.  Careful work by leading thinkers—including Jonathan Baker,<a id="_ftnref10" href="#_ftn10">[10]</a> Fiona Scott Morton<a id="_ftnref11" href="#_ftn11">[11]</a> and Nancy Rose<a id="_ftnref12" href="#_ftn12">[12]</a>—has documented the rise of market power.   A striking conclusion comes from a landmark study by John Kwoka, which surveyed the impact of nearly four dozen major mergers.  More than 80 percent of those mergers led to price <em>increases</em>.  The average price increase was around 10 percent[13]—and even more dramatic in some industries, like hospital care<a id="_ftnref14" href="#_ftn14">[14]</a> and airline tickets.<a id="_ftnref15" href="#_ftn15">[15]</a></p>



<p>These studies have upended the long-held assumption in some academic quarters that mergers generally—or indeed inherently—increase efficiency and lower prices.  The best research does not support that assumption, and that must inform our approach.</p>



<p>Recent research has also helped underscore how lack of competition can hurt workers—something that’s particularly important to President Biden. &nbsp;Because of work by economists like José Azar,<a></a><a href="#_ftn16" id="_ftnref16">[16]</a> Ioana Marinescu,<a></a><a href="#_ftn17" id="_ftnref17">[17]</a> Marshall Steinbaum,<a href="#_ftn18" id="_ftnref18">[18]</a> and Eric Posner,<a href="#_ftn19" id="_ftnref19">[19]</a> we can now see more clearly how fewer employers competing over the same talent pool reduces employees’ bargaining power.&nbsp; A recent Treasury Department report found that a lack of labor-market competition decreases wages by roughly 20 percent, as compared to a fully competitive market.<a href="#_ftn20" id="_ftnref20">[20]</a> &nbsp;This is one way that lack of competition has aggravated our inequality problems.<a href="#_ftn21" id="_ftnref21">[21]</a></p>



<p>In addition, lack of competition can dampen innovation.&nbsp; The empirical research favors a competition policy that encourages rival companies to reduce costs, strengthen quality, and develop new products, while retaining rewards for innovation.<a href="#_ftn22" id="_ftnref22">[22]</a>&nbsp; No pressure, no diamonds.</p>



<p>In short, our competition challenges ripple across our economy, harming workers, consumers, small businesses, our economic growth and competitiveness. &nbsp;One study by Thomas Philippon aggregated the harms from higher prices and lower wages and found that lack of competition could be costing the median American household some $5,000 every year.<a href="#_ftn23" id="_ftnref23">[23]</a></p>



<ol type="I"><li><strong>President Biden’s Competition Executive Order</strong></li></ol>



<p>It was against this backdrop that President Biden issued his executive order last July.<a href="#_ftn24" id="_ftnref24">[24]</a></p>



<p>This historic order has galvanized a government-wide effort to promote competition across our economy. &nbsp;At its core, it did three things:</p>



<p><strong><em>First</em></strong>, it directed 72 specific actions by more than a dozen agencies to take on concrete competition problems—from non-compete agreements to unjustifiable occupational licensing requirements, to prescription drugs and Internet bills, to airline tickets and device repairs, to personal banking and meat-processing.<a href="#_ftn25" id="_ftnref25">[25]</a> &nbsp;Our agencies worked hard to deliver over the last year. &nbsp;Here are just a few examples of what’s changing as a result:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>The FDA is changing its regulations so that hearing aids for mild-to-moderate hearing loss can be sold over-the-counter.<a href="#_ftn26" id="_ftnref26">[26]</a> &nbsp;Roughly 48 million Americans suffer from hearing loss.<a href="#_ftn27" id="_ftnref27">[27]</a> &nbsp;We expect this to be a gamechanger—spurring innovation and reducing hearing-aid prices.</li></ul>



<ul><li>The Agriculture Department is issuing a suite of new rules under the Packers and Stockyards Act, including finally changing the unfair contracting system for poultry farmers.<a href="#_ftn28" id="_ftnref28">[28]</a></li></ul>



<ul><li>Just last week, the Patent and Trademark Office and FDA announced plans to scrutinize drug patents that are driving up prices.<a href="#_ftn29" id="_ftnref29">[29]</a></li></ul>



<p>These efforts aren’t just about opening up markets to promote competition. &nbsp;They’re about looking inward, too—because government regulations can themselves get in the way of innovation and entry. &nbsp;Indeed, sometimes powerful incumbents have enlisted government to entrench themselves—so we’re working to lift regulatory barriers to encourage challengers to enter markets and compete.</p>



<p>We’re proud that the vast majority of the actions we’re taking have attracted bipartisan support. &nbsp;They’re also spurring the private sector and state legislatures to act. &nbsp;After President Biden’s executive order endorsed a “right to repair,” Apple<a href="#_ftn30" id="_ftnref30">[30]</a> and Microsoft<a href="#_ftn31" id="_ftnref31">[31]</a> announced they’d allow people to fix their own devices, and New York just passed the nation’s first “Fair Repair Law.”<a href="#_ftn32" id="_ftnref32">[32]</a></p>



<p><strong><em>Second</em></strong>, the order called on the traditional antitrust agencies—the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission—to fully and vigorously enforce our antitrust laws. &nbsp;The President nominated Jonathan Kanter to head DOJ’s Antitrust Division and Lina Khan lead the FTC. &nbsp;Both received broad bipartisan support in the Senate and are now ably leading these efforts. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Their work requires developing sensible frameworks and pursuing cases zealously in a challenging legal environment.&nbsp; It requires thinking forward to new industries and new technologies—including the challenges posed by the rise of the dominant Internet platforms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And it requires resources to rebuild capability. &nbsp;During just the last decade, our economic output increased by nearly half,<a href="#_ftn33" id="_ftnref33">[33]</a> and the annual number of completed mergers and acquisitions doubled.<a href="#_ftn34" id="_ftnref34">[34]</a>&nbsp; Yet total appropriations for DOJ’s Antitrust Division<a href="#_ftn35" id="_ftnref35">[35]</a> and the FTC<a href="#_ftn36" id="_ftnref36">[36]</a> have been essentially flat—and <em>decreased</em> in real terms.&nbsp; Keep in mind, these agencies’ core missions involve bringing complex cases against some of the best-resourced companies in the world. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Even under these constraints, our antitrust enforcement agencies have achieved important but underreported legal victories over the past year. &nbsp;The FTC, for example, worked with the Pentagon to challenge a vertical merger and keep the largest defense contractor from acquiring a major missile-component producer—likely saving taxpayers billions.<a href="#_ftn37" id="_ftnref37">[37]</a> &nbsp;And DOJ blocked a $30 billion merger between two of the world’s largest insurance brokers that would have raised prices.<a href="#_ftn38" id="_ftnref38">[38]</a></p>



<p>It’s unacceptable for these agencies’ resources to lag so far behind the growth of the economy they’re charged with protecting.&nbsp; That’s why President Biden’s Budget calls for boosting funding for both agencies, and that’s why we’ve supported passing the Merger Filing Fee Modernization Act. &nbsp;Congress should act swiftly to deliver these enhanced resources.</p>



<p><strong><em>Finally</em></strong>, the executive order prioritized <em>structural</em> change in our competition policy by establishing the White House Competition Council.&nbsp; The Council, which I chair, currently includes 17 federal agencies, and their leaders meet with the President twice a year.<a href="#_ftn39" id="_ftnref39">[39]</a>&nbsp; This body institutionalizes competition policy as part of our overall economic policy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This structural element of establishing a Competition Council may sound at first like government arcana—but in fact it’s profoundly important to turning this aircraft carrier around.&nbsp; Because what we need, at core, is capacity, creativity, and coordination across the federal government. And I want to take a moment to thank every cabinet secretary and leader of the 17 Council members for their leadership over the course of the last year. &nbsp;</p>



<p>This structure marks a fundamental innovation by President Biden—something that’s never been done before in history: Agencies are now working together to leverage <em>all </em>legally available tools to promote competition. &nbsp;That means not only more coordination and collaboration, but also a newfound ability to survey the entire economic landscape and assess how competition policy intersects with other areas, like trade policy and supply chains.</p>



<p>One year in, the Competition Council has spurred collaboration and cross-pollination between agencies. &nbsp;To take just one example, the Justice and Agriculture Departments together launched FarmerFairness.gov, a one-stop shop for reporting suspected legal violations in agriculture.<a href="#_ftn40" id="_ftnref40">[40]</a> &nbsp;Make no mistake, that’s not just another website—it reflects an innovative approach to enforcement, where these two departments now review every complaint together to assess how to best deploy <em>both </em>sets of legal authorities.</p>



<p>The Competition Council has also successfully set priorities in critical areas that are particularly important to our economy, like ocean shipping.&nbsp; Competition and performance issues in ocean shipping have spillover effects across the economy, because many businesses rely on it to transport their goods.</p>



<p>The ocean-freight system is dominated by three global alliances.&nbsp; The impact has been stark: during the pandemic, the price of shipping a container rose more than 10-fold.<a href="#_ftn41" id="_ftnref41">[41]</a> &nbsp;We’re proud that Congress answered President Biden’s call to crack down on these price hikes and unfair practices by passing the bipartisan Ocean Shipping Reform Act—the most significant reform of ocean shipping rules in decades.<a href="#_ftn42" id="_ftnref42">[42]</a></p>



<p>We’re putting forward an array of other priorities, too—from opening up labor markets<a href="#_ftn43" id="_ftnref43">[43]</a> to fighting misleading pricing.<a href="#_ftn44" id="_ftnref44">[44]</a> &nbsp;Another key area is promoting competition in the tech sector, to give small businesses and startups a better chance to compete on a level playing field. That’s why I want to reinforce our Administration’s call for Congress to pass bipartisan tech antitrust legislation.</p>



<p>Finally, the Competition Council is helping embed competition thinking into agencies’ operations.&nbsp; Our agencies are going beyond the executive order’s immediate directives to new frontiers. &nbsp;The Transportation Department just issued rules to make our new, federally funded electric-vehicle charging network open and interoperable.<a href="#_ftn45" id="_ftnref45">[45]</a> &nbsp;That wasn’t specified in the executive order, but thanks to the Competition Council’s work, we recognized the risks and potential and took action.</p>



<ol type="I"><li><strong>Reinforcing the Case for Competition</strong></li></ol>



<p>Across each of these areas—concrete agency actions; reinvigoration of antitrust enforcement; and structural change in our approach to competition policy—we’ve made great progress.</p>



<p>But before we look forward, I want to pause to clarify some things we <em>haven’t </em>been doing.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>First</em></strong>, we have not, and will not, adopt a blanket policy that “big is bad,” or that there’s a one-size-fits-all approach to antitrust and competition policy. &nbsp;Not in E.O. 14036, and not in any of our work.&nbsp; We do take the view that market structure matters, and that we need be concerned about highly concentrated markets—particularly in an environment where our antitrust agencies have been under-resourced for so long.&nbsp; But that’s different from fighting bigness for bigness’s sake.</p>



<p>And<em> <strong>second</strong></em>, we don’t see competition as the singular cure for inflation, nor do we see it as the driving cause of the global inflation we are dealing with today. &nbsp;At the same time, it <em>is </em>easier for firms to maintain higher prices in a market with just a few rivals.<a href="#_ftn46" id="_ftnref46">[46]</a> &nbsp;That’s why promoting competition is one tool—not the only one, but one tool—that can help lower price pressures in the economy across time.</p>



<p>Looking ahead, the case for bolstering competition is particularly powerful because it supports another important objective: resilience. &nbsp;A market with more competitors is usually better-equipped to handle disruptions and deliver to businesses and consumers what they need. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Consider:</p>



<ul><li>After a cyberattack hit the country’s second-largest meat processing company last year, the company had to suspend production at its plants—which process one-quarter of America’s beef and one-fifth of its pork.<a href="#_ftn47" id="_ftnref47">[47]</a></li></ul>



<ul><li>And as we saw with infant formula this year, the closure of a single plant—owned by a company that controls almost half the market—created a national shortage.<a href="#_ftn48" id="_ftnref48">[48]</a> &nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>This is one more reason sound competition policy belongs at the center of our economic policy. &nbsp;By addressing the underlying structural problem of competition, we make our supply chains more resilient—more capable of dealing with whatever shocks may come.&nbsp;</p>



<ol type="I"><li><strong>Looking Ahead</strong></li></ol>



<p>I’ve talked about what we’ve done in the last year, and why. &nbsp;But there’s much more ahead.</p>



<p>In the coming months, we’ll deliver on more of the executive order’s commitments—everything from new rules to provide airline travelers<a href="#_ftn49" id="_ftnref49">[49]</a> and broadband customers<a href="#_ftn50" id="_ftnref50">[50]</a> with upfront information to comparison-shop, to the Treasury Department collaborating with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau on fintech.<a href="#_ftn51" id="_ftnref51">[51]</a></p>



<p>We’ll also keep pushing to institutionalize competition work across the government. &nbsp;Right now, we’re focused on bringing in the sharpest talent to drive this work. &nbsp;We’ll have more to say soon, but for all the economists, policy experts, and litigators out there—now is the time for you to consider public service. &nbsp;Your country needs you, and it’s an exciting and historic moment. &nbsp;Help us keep turning the ship.</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>



<p>America has boldly recalibrated its competitiveness before—and instituted durable, structural change.&nbsp; Teddy Roosevelt did it.&nbsp; Franklin Roosevelt did it, too.&nbsp; Today, we stand at another inflection point.&nbsp; It’s within our grasp to do it again.</p>



<p>We know that innovation and openness are part of America’s economic DNA.&nbsp; This is a nation that’s led technological revolutions across industries for two centuries, and repeatedly transformed the global economy for the better. &nbsp;</p>



<p>President Biden’s actions to promote competition carry that same spirit.&nbsp; We’re confronting decades of growing market power and corporate concentration.&nbsp; That won’t be reversed overnight.&nbsp; But we’re going to keep working tirelessly to turn this ship around—and set us on a course that better serves America’s economic dynamism.</p>



<p>Thank you—and I look forward to this conversation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>Q    Madam Vice President, why come to Florida?  Why come to Florida on an issue like abortion rights?  Do you believe it&#8217;s going to really turn out voters here?<br> <br>THE VICE PRESIDENT:  So, I&#8217;m here in Florida to do a number of things. <br> <br>Immediately, I&#8217;m going to be speaking with a group of Black women leaders about the issues that I believe are most pressing and most immediate for the women of America, including the issue of choice. <br> <br>Later, I&#8217;ll be meeting with Florida State legislators.<br> <br>And then, I will end the day here in Florida, in Tampa, meeting with American servicemembers who are working in an extraordinary way to defend our liberties and our freedoms and to ensure the security of our homeland. <br> <br>When I think about the issue of choice, the President and I feel very strongly that we have a duty and obligation to protect the American people, including American women, and that includes the women in Florida. <br> <br>Here in Florida, just most recently, a law was passed &#8212; effective, I believe, July 1st &#8212; that is going to allow the government to impose its decisions on the women of Florida instead of giving women the right to choose to make decisions about some of the most personal matters a woman could have to deal with. <br> <br>We say and it is our position and it’s the position of the majorit- &#8212; of the majority of Americans: Let women, including the women of Florida, make those most personal decisions for themselves, in consultation with their priest or their pastor or their rabbi.  But it should not be the government making those decisions.<br> <br>In Florida, in particular, there&#8217;s no exception for rape or incest.<br> <br>So, I&#8217;m here to speak with these leaders to talk about what we can do together to ensure that we use all that is within our capacity to protect the women of America, which includes the women of Florida.<br>    <br>END</p>
