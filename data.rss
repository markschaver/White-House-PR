										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>Today, the President and the bipartisan group announced agreement on the details of a once-in-a-generation investment in our infrastructure, which will be taken up in the Senate for consideration. In total, the deal includes $550 billion in new federal investment in America’s infrastructure. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal will grow the economy, enhance our competitiveness, create good jobs, and make our economy more sustainable, resilient, and just.<br><br>The deal will create good-paying, union jobs. With the President’s Build Back Better Agenda, these investments will add, on average, around 2 million jobs <em>per year</em> over the course of the decade, while accelerating America’s path to full employment and increasing labor force participation.<br><br>President Biden believes that we must invest in our country and in our people by creating good-paying union jobs, tackling the climate crisis, and growing the economy sustainably and equitably for decades to come. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal will deliver progress towards those objectives for working families across the country. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal:</p>



<ul><li>Makes the largest federal investment in public transit ever</li><li>Makes the largest federal investment in passenger rail since the creation of Amtrak</li><li>Makes the single largest dedicated bridge investment since the construction of the interstate highway system</li><li>Makes the largest investment in clean drinking water and waste water infrastructure in American history, delivering clean water to millions of families</li><li>Ensures every American has access to reliable high-speed internet</li><li>Helps us tackle the climate crisis by making the largest investment in clean energy transmission and EV infrastructure in history; electrifying thousands of school and transit buses across the country; and creating a new Grid Deployment Authority to build a clean, 21<sup>st</sup> century electric grid</li></ul>



<p>The President promised to work across the aisle to deliver results for working families. He believes demonstrating that democracies can deliver is a critical challenge for his presidency. Today’s agreement shows that we can come together to position American workers, farmers, and businesses to compete and win in the 21st century.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Roads, Bridges, and Major Projects</span></strong><br><br>One in five miles, or 173,000 total miles, of our highways and major roads and 45,000 bridges are in poor condition. Bridges in poor condition pose heightened challenges in rural communities, which often may rely on a single bridge for the passage of emergency service vehicles. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal will invest $110 billion of new funds for roads, bridges, and major projects, and reauthorize the surface transportation program for the next five years building on bipartisan surface transportation reauthorization bills passed out of committee earlier this year.&nbsp; This investment will repair and rebuild our roads and bridges with a focus on climate change mitigation, resilience, equity, and safety for all users, including cyclists and pedestrians. The bill includes a total of $40 billion of new funding for bridge repair, replacement, and rehabilitation, which<strong> is the single largest dedicated bridge investment since the construction of the interstate highway system</strong>. The bill also includes a total of $17.5 billion for major projects that are too large or complex for traditional funding programs but will deliver significant economic benefits to communities.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Safety</span></strong><br><br>America has one of the highest road fatality rates in the industrialized world. The deal invests $11 billion in transportation safety programs, including a new Safe Streets for All program to help states and localities reduce crashes and fatalities in their communities, especially for cyclists and pedestrians. <strong>It will more than double funding directed to programs that improve the safety of people and vehicles in our transportation system, including highway safety, truck safety, and pipeline and hazardous materials safety.</strong><br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Public Transit</span></strong><br><br>America’s transit infrastructure is inadequate – with a multibillion-dollar repair backlog, representing more than 24,000 buses, 5,000 rail cars, 200 stations, and thousands of miles of track, signals, and power systems in need of replacement. The deal invests $39 billion of new investment to modernize transit, and improve accessibility for the elderly and people with disabilities, in addition to continuing the existing transit programs for five years as part of surface transportation reauthorization. &nbsp;<strong>This is the largest Federal investment in public transit in history, and devotes a larger share of funds from surface transportation reauthorization to transit in the history of the programs. It will repair and upgrade aging infrastructure, modernize bus and rail fleets, make stations accessible to all users, and bring transit service to new communities.</strong> It will replace thousands of transit vehicles, including buses, with clean, zero emission vehicles.&nbsp; And, it will benefit communities of color since these households are twice as likely to take public transportation and many of these communities lack sufficient public transit options.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Passenger and Freight Rail</span></strong><br><br>Unlike highways and transit, rail lacks a multi-year funding stream to address deferred maintenance, enhance existing corridors, and build new lines in high-potential locations. The deal positions Amtrak and rail to play a central role in our transportation and economic future. <strong>This is the largest investment in passenger rail since the creation of Amtrak 50 years ago.</strong> The deal invests $66 billion in rail to eliminate the Amtrak maintenance backlog, modernize the Northeast Corridor, and bring world-class rail service to areas outside the northeast and mid-Atlantic. Within these totals, $22 million would be provided as grants to Amtrak, $24 billion as federal-state partnership grants for Northeast Corridor modernization, $12 billion for partnership grants for intercity rail service, including high-speed rail, $5 billion for rail improvement and safety grants, and $3 billion for grade crossing safety improvements.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">EV Infrastructure</span></strong><br><br>U.S. market share of plug-in electric vehicle (EV) sales is only one-third the size of the Chinese EV market. The President believes that must change. The bill invests $7.5 billion to build out a national network of EV chargers. <strong>This is the first-ever national investment in EV charging infrastructure in the United States and is a critical element in the Biden-Harris Administration’s plan to accelerate the adoption of EVs to address the climate crisis and support domestic manufacturing jobs. </strong>The bill will provide funding for deployment of EV chargers along highway corridors to facilitate long-distance travel and within communities to provide convenient charging where people live, work, and shop. &nbsp;Federal funding will have a particular focus on rural, disadvantaged, and hard-to-reach communities.</p>



<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Electric Buses</span></strong><br><br>American school buses play a critical role in expanding access to education, but they are also a significant source of pollution. <strong>The deal will deliver thousands of electric school buses nationwide, including in rural communities, helping school districts across the country buy clean, American-made, zero emission buses, and replace the yellow school bus fleet for America’s children.</strong> The deal invests $2.5 billion in zero emission buses, $2.5 billion in low emission buses, and $2.5 billion for ferries. These investments will drive demand for American-made batteries and vehicles, creating jobs and supporting domestic manufacturing, while also removing diesel buses from some of our most vulnerable communities. In addition, they will help the more than 25 million children and thousands of bus drivers who breathe polluted air on their rides to and from school. Diesel air pollution is linked to asthma and other health problems that hurt our communities and cause students to miss school, particularly in communities of color and Tribal communities.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Reconnecting Communities</span></strong><br><br>Too often, past transportation investments divided communities – like the Claiborne Expressway in New Orleans or I-81 in Syracuse – or it left out the people most in need of affordable transportation options. In particular, significant portions of the interstate highway system were built through Black neighborhoods. <strong>The deal creates a first-ever program to reconnect communities divided by transportation infrastructure.</strong>&nbsp; The program will fund planning, design, demolition, and reconstruction of street grids, parks, or other infrastructure through $1 billion of dedicated funding.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Airports, Ports, and Waterways</span></strong><br><br>The United States built modern aviation, but our airports lag far behind our competitors. According to some rankings, no U.S. airports rank in the top 25 of airports worldwide. Our ports and waterways need repair and reimagination too. <strong>The bill invests $17 billion in port infrastructure and $25 billion in airports to address repair and maintenance backlogs, reduce congestion and emissions near ports and airports, and drive electrification and other low-carbon technologies</strong>. Modern, resilient, and sustainable port, airport, and freight infrastructure will support U.S. competitiveness by removing bottlenecks and expediting commerce and reduce the environmental impact on neighboring communities.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Resilience and Western Water Infrastructure</span></strong><br><br>Millions of Americans feel the effects of climate change each year when their roads wash out, airport power goes down, or schools get flooded. Last year alone, the United States faced 22 extreme weather and climate-related disaster events with losses exceeding $1 billion each – a cumulative price tag of nearly $100 billion. People of color are more likely to live in areas most vulnerable to flooding and other climate change-related weather events. <strong>The deal makes our communities safer and our infrastructure more resilient to the impacts of climate change and cyber attacks, with an investment of over $50 billion.</strong> This includes funds to protect against droughts and floods, in addition to a major investment in weatherization. The bill is the largest investment in the resilience of physical and natural systems in American history.</p>



<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Clean Drinking Water</span></strong><br><br>Currently, up to 10 million American households and 400,000 schools and child care centers lack safe drinking water. <strong>The deal’s $55 billion investment represents the largest investment in clean drinking water in American history, including dedicated funding to replace lead service lines and the dangerous chemical PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl).</strong> It will replace all of the nation’s lead pipes and service lines. From rural towns to struggling cities, the deal invests in water infrastructure across America, including in Tribal Nations and disadvantaged communities that need it most.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">High-Speed Internet</span></strong></p>



<p>Broadband internet is necessary for Americans to do their jobs, to participate equally in school learning, health care, and to stay connected. Yet, by one definition, more than 30 million Americans live in areas where there is no broadband infrastructure that provides minimally acceptable speeds – a particular problem in rural communities throughout the country. <strong>The deal’s $65 billion investment ensures every American has access to reliable high-speed internet with an historic investment in broadband infrastructure deployment, </strong>just as the federal government made a historic effort to provide electricity to every American nearly one hundred years ago.</p>



<p>The bill will also help lower prices for internet service by requiring funding recipients to offer a low-cost affordable plan, by creating price transparency and helping families comparison shop, and by boosting competition in areas where existing providers aren’t providing adequate service. It will also help close the digital divide by passing the Digital Equity Act, ending digital redlining, and creating a permanent program to help more low-income households access the internet.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Environmental Remediation</span></strong></p>



<p>In thousands of rural and urban communities around the country, hundreds of thousands of former industrial and energy sites are now idle – sources of blight and pollution. 26% of Black Americans and 29% of Hispanic Americans live within 3 miles of a Superfund site, a higher percentage than for Americans overall. Proximity to a Superfund site can lead to elevated levels of lead in children’s blood. <strong>The deal invests $21 billion in environmental remediation, making the largest investment in addressing the legacy pollution that harms the public health of communities and neighborhoods in American history, creating good-paying union jobs in hard-hit energy communities and advancing economic and environmental justice. </strong>The bill includes funds to clean up superfund and brownfield sites, reclaim abandoned mine land and cap orphaned gas wells.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Power Infrastructure</span></strong><br><br>As the recent Texas power outages demonstrated, our aging electric grid needs urgent modernization. A Department of Energy study found that power outages cost the U.S. economy up to $70 billion annually. <strong>The deal’s $73 billion investment is the single largest investment in clean energy transmission in American history</strong>.&nbsp; It upgrades our power infrastructure, including by building thousands of miles of new, resilient transmission lines to facilitate the expansion of renewable energy. It creates a new Grid Deployment Authority, invests in research and development for advanced transmission and electricity distribution technologies, and promotes smart grid technologies that deliver flexibility and resilience. It invests in demonstration projects and research hubs for next generation technologies like advanced nuclear reactors, carbon capture, and clean hydrogen.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Offsets</span></strong><br><br>In the years ahead, the deal, which will generate significant economic benefits, and it is financed through a combination of redirecting unspent emergency relief funds, targeted corporate user fees, strengthening tax enforcement when it comes to crypto currencies, and other bipartisan measures, in addition to the revenue generated from higher economic growth as a result of the investments.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Aboard Air Force One<br>En Route Allentown, Pennsylvania</p>



<p>11:45 A.M. EDT</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE: &nbsp;I’ve never done this on the small plane before, so bear with me. &nbsp;Hey, everybody.&nbsp; Good to see everyone.&nbsp; Welcome to our flight to Lehigh, Pennsyl &#8212; Valley, today in Pennsylvania.</p>



<p>As you all know, today we announced a proposed Buy American rule.&nbsp; The President believes that when we spend American taxpayer dollars, it should support American workers and business.</p>



<p>In Lehigh Valley today, he will talk about the importance of this Buy American policy to support and grow more American companies and put more American workers in good-paying union jobs, strengthen American manufacturing, and secure critical supply chains while confronting the climate crisis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During his trip, the President will visit the Lehigh Valley Operations manufacturing facility for Mack Trucks.&nbsp; There are more than 1,500 Mack trucks in the federal fleet, used by both military and civilian agencies.&nbsp; And the President will receive a briefing on the Mack Trucks’ electrical dump truck.</p>



<p>Every Mack truck built for the North American market gets its start at the companies cab and vehicle assembly plant in the lower Macu- &#8212; Macungie township &#8212; I know I messed that up; apologies to Pennsylvania and that township.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ability to build and sell these new trucks would be helped by the President’s proposed investment in Buy American production incentives for domestic electric vehicle manufacturing.</p>



<p>Today, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, CFBP [CFPB], is launching a new rental assistant finder for Americans who may be behind on their rent.&nbsp; You can go to ConsumerFinance.gov/RentHelp and input location information to find local rental assistance programs in the area and apply for assistance.</p>



<p>Thanks to the American Rescue Plan, billions of dollars in federal rental assistance is available to renters who are behind on housing costs and for landlords who have struggled during the pandemic.</p>



<p>Private-sector companies from PayPal and Square, Lyft, and GoFundMe, to nonprofits including United Way, the National Low Income Housing Coalition, and Bread for the World will join with the Biden-Harris administration to raise awareness for this new and important tool, as well as the resources available to assist tenants and landlords.</p>



<p>And as we announced last week, in June, over $1.5 billion was distributed to renters and landlords more than previous &#8212; the previous five months.</p>



<p>And with that, Josh, do you want to kick us off?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; Two subject areas. &nbsp;First, we know that the administration is considering a vaccine mandate for federal employees.&nbsp; Can you give us any guidance in terms of how you&#8217;re defining federal employees?&nbsp; Does that include military, contractors? &nbsp;Would visitors to federal agencies also fall under that?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; So, Josh, let me first say that, you know, our goal as a federal employer is to keep our employees safe and to also save lives.&nbsp; That is the number-one goal that we have here.</p>



<p>While no decision has been finalized, I will say that the attestation of vaccination for federal employees is one option under strong consideration.&nbsp; So, attestation &#8212; what we mean by that is confirming &#8212; which means confirming vaccination status or abiding by stringent COVID-19 protocols, like mandatory mask wearing, even in communities not with high or subsequent substantial spread, and regular testing.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve also said requirements for vaccination may be under consideration for certain entities within the government.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have any updates to preview on that front today.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are you concerned that imposing a mask mandate could exacerbate divisions in the United States that have already been so present in terms of vaccination rates?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Well, let me just &#8212; like I said, they’re &#8212; right now we are &#8212; have many options that we&#8217;re looking under consideration.</p>



<p>But let me just step back, because I think &#8212; I want to take this opportunity, with the CDC mask guidance that was given &#8212; again, not a mandate, as you know, but a guidance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You know, yesterday the CDC did exactly what it was &#8212; it&#8217;s supposed to do.&nbsp; And I&#8217;m sure you all saw &#8212; are tracking what the public health experts have said &#8212; said this as &#8212; said as much.&nbsp; The message is simple: If you are in an area where Delta is surging, you should mask up indoors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The CDC has to adapt to the virus.&nbsp; And unfortunately, because not enough Americans have stepped up to get vaccinated, they had to provide new guidance to help save lives, especially for those immunocompromised and children, children who &#8212; especially those children who are 11 and under who do not have &#8212; are not able to get vaccinated at this time.&nbsp; So, this is critical.</p>



<p>Again, we want to make sure we&#8217;re saving lives.&nbsp; The CDC guidance was done nonpartisan. &nbsp;It was done as they are looking through guidance, and to really meet the moment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We&#8217;re dealing with a virus, as you all know, that&#8217;s unprecedented.&nbsp; There&#8217;s no playbook for this virus.&nbsp; And again, we need to make sure that we&#8217;re saving lives.&nbsp; And we are going to continue to do everything that we can to make sure people are getting vaccinated.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karine, why would the White House be confident that people in these red zones now will listen to this new mask guidance if they&#8217;ve shrugged off the vaccination message from the White House, if they&#8217;ve shrugged off mask guidance before?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Well, let me &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why are you so confident now?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Well, Karen, let me first say that the CDC is a &#8212; is a body that is highly respected.&nbsp; It is a body that people look towards.&nbsp; And you&#8217;re right &#8212; you know, we &#8212; we are &#8212; we are going to make sure that we go community by community.&nbsp; I&#8217;m sure the CDC is going to have a communication &#8212; you know, kind of apparatus of communication with local governments on how to best do this.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But this was &#8212; this needed to happen.&nbsp; Right?&nbsp; They are following the science.&nbsp; We have said this all along.&nbsp; The science is the North Star.&nbsp; We have to listen to public health experts.&nbsp; And, right now, again, we&#8217;re trying to make sure that we&#8217;re saving lives.</p>



<p>But, again, we need to make sure that people who are not vaccinated get vaccinated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karine &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. HAYES:&nbsp; We have to stop because we have to land.&nbsp; They&#8217;re making us sit down because we have to land.</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Oh, okay.&nbsp; Sorry, guys.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Major companies, non-profits, and government agencies from the Social Security Administration to the Department of Veterans Affairs, to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have answered the Biden-Harris Administration’s Call to Action to spread the word and alert Americans that emergency rental assistance is available.&#160; The combined commitments announced today – part of an&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>Major companies, non-profits, and government agencies from the Social Security Administration to the Department of Veterans Affairs, to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have answered the Biden-Harris Administration’s Call to Action to spread the word and alert Americans that emergency rental assistance is available.&nbsp; The combined commitments announced today – part of an ongoing all-out push to make sure tenants and landlords take advantage of federal rental assistance to help cover rent, utilities, and other housing costs and keep people in their homes – could reach tens of millions of Americans.</p>



<p>The continued call to action coincides with the launch of a new rental assistance finder produced by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). Americans who may be behind on rent can go to <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/coronavirus/mortgage-and-housing-assistance/renter-protections/find-help-with-rent-and-utilities/?utm_source=vanity&amp;utm_medium=outreach&amp;utm_campaign=renthelp">ConsumerFinance.gov/RentHelp</a> and input information on their location to find local rental assistance programs in their area and apply for assistance.</p>



<p>Thanks to the American Rescue Plan, billions of dollars in federal rental assistance is available to renters who are behind on&nbsp;housing costs,&nbsp;as well as landlords who have struggled during the pandemic. The Administration is building on a whole-of-government effort and engaging a wide variety of stakeholders to spread awareness of the CFPB’s new tool, as well as the resources available to assist tenants and landlords.</p>



<p>Emergency rental assistance is available to tenants in all 50 states, Washington, D.C., territories, and in Tribal areas, and will continue to be available after the expiration of the CDC eviction moratorium on August 1, 2021. The continued Call to Action builds on the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/24/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-initiatives-to-promote-housing-stability-by-supporting-vulnerable-tenants-and-preventing-foreclosures/">groundwork laid over the past several months</a> by the Administration to engage renters and landlords, including hosting two virtual convenings with thousands of participants to share best practices on eviction prevention and build local plans of action, streamline guidance for the rental assistance program to make it easier and more efficient, and engage agencies across the federal government to help get the word out to households in need.</p>



<p>For more general information about the Emergency Rental Assistance program, <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/coronavirus/mortgage-and-housing-assistance/renter-protections/emergency-rental-assistance-for-renters/?utm_source=paypal&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=era_outreach">visit the unified federal housing assistance portal hosted by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</a>.</p>

<p>Protection of our Nation&#8217;s critical infrastructure is a responsibility of the government at the Federal, State, local, Tribal, and territorial levels and of the owners and operators of that infrastructure.&nbsp; The cybersecurity threats posed to the systems that control and operate the critical infrastructure on which we all depend are among the most significant and growing issues confronting our Nation.&nbsp; The degradation, destruction, or malfunction of systems that control this infrastructure could cause significant harm to the national and economic security of the United States.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline">Section&nbsp;1.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline">Policy.</span>&nbsp; It is the policy of my Administration to safeguard the critical infrastructure of the Nation, with a particular focus on the cybersecurity and resilience of systems supporting National Critical Functions, defined as the functions of Government and the private sector so vital to the United States that their disruption, corruption, or dysfunction would have a debilitating effect on national security, economic security, public health or safety, or any combination thereof.&nbsp;<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec.&nbsp;2.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline">Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity Initiative.</span>&nbsp; Accordingly, I have established an Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity Initiative (Initiative), a voluntary, collaborative effort between the Federal Government and the critical infrastructure community to significantly improve the cybersecurity of these critical systems.&nbsp; The primary objective of this Initiative is to defend the United&nbsp;States&#8217; critical infrastructure by encouraging and facilitating deployment of technologies and systems that provide threat visibility, indications, detection, and warnings, and that facilitate response capabilities for cybersecurity in essential control system and operational technology networks.&nbsp; The goal of the Initiative is to greatly expand deployment of these technologies across priority critical infrastructure.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec.&nbsp;3.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline">Furthering the Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity Initiative.&nbsp;</span> The Initiative creates a path for Government and industry to collaborate to take immediate action, within their respective spheres of control, to address these serious threats.&nbsp; The Initiative builds on, expands, and accelerates ongoing cybersecurity efforts in critical infrastructure sectors and is an important step in addressing these threats.&nbsp; We cannot address threats we cannot see; therefore, deploying systems and technologies that can monitor control systems to detect malicious activity and facilitate response actions to cyber threats is central to ensuring the safe operations of these critical systems.&nbsp; The Federal Government will work with industry to share threat information for priority control system critical infrastructure throughout the country.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(a) &nbsp;The Initiative began with a pilot effort with the Electricity Subsector, and is now followed by a similar effort for natural gas pipelines.&nbsp; Efforts for the Water and Wastewater Sector Systems and Chemical Sector will follow later this year.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(b) &nbsp;Sector Risk Management Agencies, as defined in section&nbsp;9002(a)(7) of Public Law 116-283, and other executive departments and agencies (agencies), as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, shall work with critical infrastructure stakeholders and owners and operators to implement the principles and policy outlined in this memorandum.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec.&nbsp;4.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline">Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity Performance Goals.&nbsp;</span> Cybersecurity needs vary among critical infrastructure sectors, as do cybersecurity practices.&nbsp; However, there is a need for baseline cybersecurity goals that are consistent across all critical infrastructure sectors, as well as a need for security controls for select critical infrastructure that is dependent on control systems.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(a) &nbsp;Pursuant to section 7(d) of Executive Order 13636 of&nbsp;February 12, 2013 (Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity), the Secretary of Homeland Security, in coordination with the Secretary of Commerce (through the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology) and other agencies, as appropriate, shall develop and issue cybersecurity performance goals for critical infrastructure to&nbsp;further a common understanding of the baseline security practices that critical infrastructure owners and operators should follow to protect national and economic security, as well&nbsp;as public health and safety.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(b) &nbsp;This effort shall begin with the Secretary of Homeland&nbsp;Security issuing preliminary goals for control systems&nbsp;across critical infrastructure sectors no later than September&nbsp;22,&nbsp;2021, followed by the issuance of final cross-sector control system goals within 1 year of the date of this memorandum.&nbsp; Additionally, following consultations with relevant agencies, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall issue sector-specific critical infrastructure cybersecurity performance goals within 1 year of the date of this memorandum.&nbsp; These performance goals should serve as clear guidance to owners and operators about cybersecurity practices and postures that the American people can trust and should expect for such essential services.&nbsp; That effort may also include an examination of whether additional legal authorities would be beneficial to enhancing the cybersecurity of critical infrastructure, which is vital to the American people and the security of our Nation.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec.&nbsp;5.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline">General Provisions.</span>&nbsp; (a)&nbsp; Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(i) &nbsp;&nbsp;the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(ii) &nbsp;the functions of the Director of the Office of&nbsp;Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(b) &nbsp;This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with&nbsp;applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations, where funding assistance may be required to implement control system cybersecurity recommendations.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(c) &nbsp;This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United&nbsp;States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.</p>

<p>The Biden Administration continues to take steps to safeguard U.S. critical infrastructure from growing, persistent, and sophisticated cyber threats. Recent high-profile attacks on critical infrastructure around the world, including the ransomware attacks on the Colonial Pipeline and JBS Foods in the United States, demonstrate that significant cyber vulnerabilities exist across U.S. critical infrastructure, which is largely owned and operated by the private sector. As we have seen, the degradation, destruction, or malfunction of systems that control this infrastructure can have cascading physical consequences that could have a debilitating effect on national security, economic security, and the public health and safety of the American people.</p>



<p>Currently, federal cybersecurity regulation in the United States is sectoral. We have a patchwork of sector-specific statutes that have been adopted piecemeal, as data security threats in particular sectors have gained public attention. Given the evolving threat we face today, we must consider new approaches, both voluntary and mandatory. We look to responsible critical infrastructure owners and operators to follow voluntary guidance as well as mandatory requirements in order to ensure that the critical services the American people rely on are protected from cyber threats.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, President Biden is signing a National Security Memorandum (NSM) on “Improving Cybersecurity for Critical Infrastructure Control Systems,” which addresses cybersecurity for critical infrastructure and implements long overdue efforts to meet the threats we face. The NSM:</p>



<ul><li>Directs the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Department of Commerce’s National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), in collaboration with other agencies, to develop cybersecurity performance goals for critical infrastructure. We expect those standards will assist companies responsible for providing essential services like power, water, and transportation to strengthen their cybersecurity.<br></li><li>Formally establishes the President’s Industrial Control System Cybersecurity (ICS) Initiative. The ICS initiative is a voluntary, collaborative effort between the federal government and the critical infrastructure community to facilitate the deployment of technology and systems that provide threat visibility, indicators, detections, and warnings. The Initiative <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/20/statement-by-nsc-spokesperson-emily-horne-on-the-biden-administrations-efforts-to-protect-u-s-critical-infrastructure/">began in mid-April</a> with an Electricity Subsector pilot, and already over 150 electricity utilities representing almost 90 million residential customers are either deploying or have agreed to deploy control system cybersecurity technologies. The action plan for natural gas pipelines is underway, and additional initiatives for other sectors will follow later this year.</li></ul>



<p>Last week, the Department of Homeland Security’s Transportation Security Administration (TSA) announced a second Security Directive for critical pipeline owners and operators.&nbsp; Following the ransomware attack on a major petroleum pipeline in May 2021, <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/news/2021/05/27/dhs-announces-new-cybersecurity-requirements-critical-pipeline-owners-and-operators">TSA issued an initial Security Directive</a> requiring critical pipeline owners and operators to report cybersecurity incidents, designate a Cybersecurity Coordinator, and conduct a review of their current cybersecurity practices. This second Security Directive will require owners and operators of pipelines that transport hazardous liquids and natural gas to implement a number of urgently needed protections, including:</p>



<ul><li>Implementing specific mitigation measures to protect against ransomware attacks and other known threats to information technology and operational technology systems within prescribed timeframes.<br></li><li>Developing and implementing a cybersecurity contingency and recovery plan.<br></li><li>Conducting an annual cybersecurity architecture design review.</li></ul>



<p>The Federal Government cannot do this alone and securing our critical infrastructure requires a whole-of-nation effort. This NSM, the ICS Cybersecurity Initiative, TSA’s Security Directives and the President’s <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/05/12/fact-sheet-president-signs-executive-order-charting-new-course-to-improve-the-nations-cybersecurity-and-protect-federal-government-networks/">Executive Order on Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity</a> are parts of a focused and aggressive continuing effort to address these significant threats to our nation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>6:02 P.M. EDT<br>&nbsp;<br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Thank you. &nbsp;Hey, everyone.&nbsp; Thank you for joining us on a 6:00 p.m. on a Tuesday evening.&nbsp; So, you’re joined by senior administration officials today to give you an embargoed preview of a step we’re announcing tomorrow to protect the cybersecurity of our critical infrastructure.&nbsp; This is embargoed until 9:00 a.m. Eastern tomorrow, Wednesday, July 28.<br>&nbsp;<br>Just for your awareness and not for reporting, you’re joined by [senior administration official].&nbsp; I’m going to turn it over to [senior administration official] to kick us off.&nbsp; Thank you.<br>&nbsp;<br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Good evening, everyone.&nbsp; It’s good to be here with you today.<br>&nbsp;<br>So, I’ll walk you through an update on our efforts to protect U.S. critical infrastructure from the growing, persistent, and sophisticated threats, and talk about the specific effort we will be rolling out tomorrow.<br>&nbsp;<br>So, first, just to kind of put in context the administration’s overall approach to cybersecurity, as I’ve talked about in the past, our approach to addressing cyber threats have three lines of effort.<br>&nbsp;<br>First: Modernizing our defenses.&nbsp; Modernizing national defenses, federal government, state and local government critical infrastructure, incentives to the broader private sector, so that they’re modern enough to meet the threat.<br>&nbsp;<br>Second: Rebuilding our presence on the international stage.&nbsp; The work we’re doing to build coalitions &#8212; for example, to counter ransomware.&nbsp; The outreach we’re doing, you saw in the G7, where we brought countries together &#8212; the recent attribution of the Hafnium incident, MSS, with a very large number of countries joining us.&nbsp; We’re really putting a focus on collective defense and on moving out together with other countries.<br>&nbsp;<br>And, then, finally: Ensuring the nation is postured to compete.&nbsp; And that deals with ensuring we have all instruments of national power needed and the policies to enable their use as needed.<br>&nbsp;<br>So, today, I will preview a rollout we have tomorrow that further advances our efforts in the first category to modernize the nation’s defenses, specifically by defending critical infrastructure.<br>&nbsp;<br>So, those of you who have reported on critical infrastructure know that federal cybersecurity regulation in the U.S. is sectoral.&nbsp; We have a patchwork of sector-specific statutes that have been adopted piecemeal, typically in response to discrete security threats in particular sectors that gained public attention.<br>&nbsp;<br>So, our current posture is woefully insufficient given the evolving threat we face today.&nbsp; We really kicked the can down the road for a long time.&nbsp; The administration is committed to leveraging every authority we have, though limited, and we’re also open to new approaches, both voluntary and mandatory.<br>&nbsp;<br>Responsible critical infrastructure owners and operators should be following voluntary guidance as well as mandatory requirements in order to ensure that the critical services the American people rely on are protected from cyber threats.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So, here is the new information:<br>&nbsp;<br>Tomorrow morning, the President will sign a National Security Memorandum on “Improving Cybersecurity for Critical Infrastructure Control Systems,” which addresses cybersecurity for critical infrastructure and implements long-overdue efforts to meet the threats we face.<br>&nbsp;<br>So, the National Security Memorandum will direct the Department of Homeland Security’s CISA and the Department of Commerce’s NIST, in collaboration with other agencies, to develop cybersecurity performance goals for critical infrastructure.<br>&nbsp;<br>Second, it’ll formally establish the President’s Industrial Control System Cybersecurity Initiative.&nbsp; As you recall, the ICS initiative is a voluntary, collaborative effort between the federal government and the critical infrastructure community to facilitate the deployment of technology and systems that provide threat visibility, indicators, detections, and warnings.<br>&nbsp;<br>You’ll recall we launched the initiative in mid-April with an Electricity Subsector pilot, and already over 150 electricity utilities representing almost 90 million residential customers are either deploying or have agreed to deploy control system cybersecurity technologies.&nbsp; These are the technologies that, had they been in place, would have blocked what occurred at Colonial Pipeline in that they connect the operational technology side of the network to the IT side of the network.&nbsp; The action plan for natural gas pipelines is underway, and additional initiatives for other sectors will follow later this year.<br>&nbsp;<br>So this a public-private initiative effort with a focus to roll out these very specific technologies voluntarily, by the private sector, in close cooperation to really ensure we get those protections in place within the voluntary model that is in place for our cybersecurity for critical infrastructure today.<br>&nbsp;<br>The point we want to make is: The federal government cannot do this alone.&nbsp; Securing our critical infrastructure requires a whole-of-nation effort, and industry has to do their part.&nbsp; These may be voluntary, but we hope and expect that all responsible critical infrastructure owners and operators will apply them.&nbsp; We can’t stress it enough that they owe that to the Americans that they serve for these critical services to have more resilience.<br>&nbsp;<br>And as we’ve said, we’re exploring everything we can do to mandate strengthening of cybersecurity standards.&nbsp; You saw, last week, DHS’s Transportation Security Administration announced the second Security Directive for critical pipeline owners and operators.&nbsp; It will require owners and operators of pipelines that transport hazardous liquids and natural gas to implement a number of urgently needed protections, including implementing specific mitigation measures to protect against ransomware attacks and other known threats, IT and OT, within prescribed timeframes; developing and implementing a cybersecurity contingency and recovery plan; conducting an annual cybersecurity architecture design review.<br>&nbsp;<br>So, again, the federal government can’t do this alone, and securing our critical infrastructure requires a whole-of-nation effort.&nbsp; This National Security Memorandum, the ICS Cybersecurity Initiative, TSA’s Security Directives, and foundationally, the President’s Executive Order on Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity that he signed back in May all are parts of our focused and aggressive continuing effort to address these significant threats to our nation within that first line of modernizing defense of our cybersecurity &#8212; of the administration’s cybersecurity strategy.<br>&nbsp;<br>So, with that, I’ll pause, and I’m really looking forward to hearing your questions.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi.&nbsp; Thanks so much for doing this.&nbsp; So you said you&#8217;re exploring ways to mandate cyber protections for critical infrastructure.&nbsp; Do you think that the federal government does not have sufficient authorities right now?&nbsp; And do you need Congress to do something to give you those authorities to expand protections into sectors that don’t currently have it?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; So, we have a patchwork of sector-specific statutes today that really have been adapted piecemeal.&nbsp; And we feel that the administration &#8212; the government&#8217;s responsibility is to feel confident that critical services that the American public rely on have the modernized defenses to ensure that they can continue to deliver the critical services they do.&nbsp; And the current patchwork of sector-specific statutes does not enable us to say we have confidence that there is cybersecurity thresholds in place with regard to practices and with regard to technology, governance, and practices.&nbsp; That is something that will likely require the Hill to partner with us to address.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>But we&#8217;re just beginning, you know, the first steps, and the first step is really articulating that today&#8217;s patchwork of sector-specific approaches, state-level approaches, certainly is not enabling us to meet the threat.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And I just &#8212; I&#8217;ll expand on that for a moment because I suspect many of you have that question.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So essentially today, you know, there&#8217;s no strategic, coordinated requirement for the cybersecurity of critical infrastructure.&nbsp; To the extent, as I noted, there are mandatory cybersecurity requirements.&nbsp; They&#8217;re either sector specific &#8212; finance and chemical; they&#8217;re mandated under state or local law, like electricity ones; or they’re limited and piecemeal &#8212; water and bulk electricity are two that we’ve put a lot of work into studying in the last few weeks.<br>&nbsp;<br>So, short of legislation, there isn&#8217;t a comprehensive way to require deployment of security technologies and practices that address, really, the threat environment that we face.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, thank you so much for doing this.&nbsp; I&#8217;m curious, to the extent that these industries and sectors are aware that something might be coming from the administration, what sort of response and reaction have you gotten to the collaboration and the notion that they should be strengthening their defense along the lines of what the administration envisions?&nbsp; Do you anticipate any sort of pushback?<br>&nbsp;<br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: &nbsp;That’s a really good question, Eric.&nbsp; Thank you for it.&nbsp; So, a big part of our approach has been actively engaging the private sector in new and innovative ways.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So, the President&#8217;s Industrial Control System Cybersecurity Initiative is a great example where, you know, we have the Department of Energy work very closely with the electricity subsector ISAC and identify the most critical utilities &#8212; those that serve the largest number of Americans, et cetera.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And then we kicked off the pilot effort that saw, as I mentioned, over 150 electricity utilities and almost 90 million customers, you know, agreeing to deploy or having already deployed control system cybersecurity technologies.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>In addition to that, we brought in a number of CEOs of utilities and pipelines to brief them on the threats so that they had the same information we had regarding the sense of urgency we feel to address the cybersecurity threat.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So, I think what we&#8217;re seeing &#8212; and I think &#8212; the final thing I would say is, in the executive order, as you saw, we really ate our own dog food in that the federal government said, &#8220;We&#8217;re going to roll out these five critical cybersecurity technologies, and we&#8217;re going to do it on a rapid timeframe.”&nbsp; Encryption rolled out, for example, within six months.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So I think we&#8217;re showing a willingness to do the work we need to do, and I think we&#8217;re showing a willingness to share information in new ways, come up with voluntary ways, but also making clear that given the criticality of the threat, we need to move with urgency and we need to look at all options &#8212; voluntary and mandatory &#8212; to achieve the rapid progress we need.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey.&nbsp; I want to ask about, kind of, how you see this specific announcement having an impact, because I (inaudible) to understand it &#8212; I might be getting this wrong: Largely, this is an announcement about a voluntary public-private initiative, but it&#8217;s also kind of a larger commentary on where things are now from a standards and regulatory standpoint.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So is the idea in making this announcement to signal to these sectors that regulation could be on the way and so it&#8217;s best to start moving now in terms of their defenses?&nbsp; Or like &#8212; I&#8217;m trying to understand exactly what the purpose is, as far as your message.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Absolutely.&nbsp; So, first, it&#8217;s the President.&nbsp; It’s the President using his position to say: Cybersecurity is a focus; we must move with urgency; the federal government cannot do this alone.&nbsp; You know, almost 90 percent of critical infrastructure in the U.S. is owned and operated by the private sector.&nbsp; And securing critical infrastructure needs a whole-of-nation effort.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So the first piece it says is: We are going to do our part by outlining performance controls that cover all critical infrastructure, that say these are the thresholds that we expect responsible owners and operators to go, and start moving there voluntarily, because that is the threshold that we as a government expect our private-sector owners and operators to meet.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And clearly, you know, we&#8217;re saying, as well, that the absence of a strategic, coordinated requirement to the cybersecurity of critical infrastructure and the absence of mandated cybersecurity requirements for critical infrastructure is what, in many ways, has brought us to the level of vulnerability we have today.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>We&#8217;re committed to addressing it.&nbsp; We&#8217;re starting with voluntary, as much as we can, because we want to do this in full partnership.&nbsp; And &#8212; but we&#8217;re also pursuing all options we have in order to make the rapid progress we need.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Evening.&nbsp; Thank you for doing this.&nbsp; So, at the end of the Bush administration &#8212; not to, you know, date me going through briefings like this &#8212; there was a fairly similar discussion about public-private issues.&nbsp; And then, of course, in Congress, during the Obama administration, there was the failure of a cyber bill that was opposed, not merely on cybersecurity, obviously, but that would have sort of more mandated public-private elements.&nbsp; And then, in the Trump administration, there was the bulk-power order that came out, I think, just last year.<br>&nbsp;<br>So, my broader question to you is: What makes this effort different from the last three administrations trying to grapple with it, other than its comprehensiveness?<br>&nbsp;<br>And then, specifically, can you tell us: Does the bulk-power order that that President Trump signed still exist?&nbsp; Did you learn from that, that it actually made any difference?&nbsp; Because that sounds to me like the closest experiment in this.<br>&nbsp;<br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; So, thank you, David.&nbsp; Why is this night different from any other night?&nbsp; Well done.<br>&nbsp;<br>I would say you are exactly right.&nbsp; You know, there have been multiple prior efforts to address &#8212; let&#8217;s &#8212; taking a step back &#8212; you know, multiple administrations have recognized that there are no mandated authorities to mandate cybersecurity requirements for critical infrastructure, and they&#8217;ve done their best within that.<br>&nbsp;<br>You know, I know, in my own career, I&#8217;ve led multiple public-private partnership efforts &#8212; right? &#8212; to try to do the kinds of things to get the sector to move.&nbsp; And there are various reasons why not: Sometimes it&#8217;s costly.&nbsp; Sometimes these sectors are regulated.&nbsp; So, unless public utilities commissions approve rate increases, they feel their costs aren&#8217;t recoverable.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And I think that&#8217;s why, you know, we&#8217;ve tried a number of things here.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>I mentioned the ICS Initiative because that was where we really took a very innovative approach of identifying the most critical companies; engaging key leaders in the sector to help us; using the ISAC to bring companies together &#8212; you know, having this regular rhythm of weekly check-ins to really drive that progress.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>But we&#8217;re also saying &#8212; so that &#8212; so this NSM and the fact that it&#8217;s, you know, being announced by the President, in the context of TSA&#8217;s recent mandates that they occurred; in the context of our openly saying that we really are committed to addressing the limited and piecemeal regulation; in the context of the current environment where the threat is known and seen by critical infrastructure owners and private sectors.<br>&nbsp;<br>You know, you look at Colonial Pipeline, you look at the JBS Foods, you look at Kaseya &#8212; there&#8217;s now a different threat.&nbsp; The threats that many people have talked about have become real.&nbsp; So, we believe these goals will be viewed differently, and we believe that we&#8217;re making clear that critical infrastructure should adopt these measures.&nbsp; The President is essentially saying, &#8220;We expect responsible owners and operators to meet these performance goals.&nbsp; We will look to you to implement this.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;<br>And, you know, we&#8217;re also going to be looking at all options, including working with the Congress to ensure that we can have the confidence we need to &#8212; that these critical services are protected for the American people.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi.&nbsp; Hey, there.&nbsp; Thanks for doing this.&nbsp; So, like, along the lines of &#8220;all possible options,&#8221; we all know the vast majority of ransomware attacks exploit vulnerabilities that have already been published in the National Vulnerability Database, and the issue is that operators haven&#8217;t implemented a patch.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And I think in a lot of cases, certainly the cases of &#8212; not necessarily critical infrastructure providers, but some infrastructure providers, like schools and hospitals, and possibly some critical infrastructure providers, they would say the reason they can&#8217;t implement the patches is because they can&#8217;t get the new operating system; they can&#8217;t get the new operating system because they don&#8217;t have the new hardware, and they need money.<br>&nbsp;<br>So, is there any efforts &#8212; is there any appetite to possibly award funds or grants for new IT modernization equipment to help some providers to meet these goals?<br>&nbsp;<br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; That’s a really good question &#8212; right? &#8212; because the goals &#8212; the cybersecurity performance goals are goals that they drive adoption &#8212; right? &#8212; of effective practices and control.&nbsp; And one great one could be critical patch &#8212; you know, critical vulnerabilities.&nbsp; Those with the higher CVE scores, you know, are patched within some set time period quickly, because of the risk there.<br>&nbsp;<br>So, you know, some of what we&#8217;ve been looking at is, for example &#8212; and I love your question &#8212; is for some regulated sectors: you know, public utility commissions, other entities.&nbsp; Who sets those rates so that they can recover costs?&nbsp;&nbsp; And, you know, similarly, FERC and some of the regulators &#8212; bringing them in, sharing the information regarding the threats, helping them understand so they&#8217;re a part of the story.<br>&nbsp;<br>So, we&#8217;ve been investing a lot of time in understanding the incentives and understanding the barriers and looking at what can be done across grants, across potential tax credits, across, potentially, you know, performance incentive mechanisms.&nbsp; Cyber insurance is a really interesting mechanism as well.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So, each of those things we&#8217;re looking at and exploring &#8212; no announcements yet &#8212; but to really understand, you know, how to accelerate voluntary adoption.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi.&nbsp; Thanks so much for doing this tonight.&nbsp; I apologize for asking something that&#8217;s not directly on topic, but we did hear from the President today on a number of cyber issues, and he made some pretty strong comments about Russia and how they&#8217;re already interfering in the 2020 &#8212; 2022 Midterm Elections.&nbsp; He called it &#8220;a clear violation of sovereignty.&#8221;&nbsp; So I wanted to ask you to expand on that, if you could, in what you’re seeing in terms of these Russian tactics for 2022 &#8212; what they&#8217;re doing, what response there has been, where that and what channels that response has been given.<br>&nbsp;<br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Thanks, Alex.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not prepared to speak more to that issue this evening, but we&#8217;ll be happy to at some point.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not prepared to speak to that more in detail.<br>&nbsp;<br>OPERATOR:&nbsp; I&#8217;m now happy to turn it back to [senior administration official] for any closing remarks.<br>&nbsp;<br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Thanks, everyone, for joining us today.&nbsp; Just a reminder that this call is embargoed until tomorrow, Wednesday, July 28th, until 9:00 a.m. Eastern.<br>&nbsp;<br>If you have any other questions or follow-ups, please feel free to reach out.&nbsp; Thank you for your time.<br>&nbsp;<br>6:20 P.M. EDT</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Biden-Harris Administration will increase American-made content in federal purchases and bolster critical supply chains</em></p>



<p>The President believes that when we spend American taxpayers’ dollars, it should support American workers and businesses. In his first week in office, President Biden signed Executive Order 14005, <em>Ensuring the Future is Made in All of America by All of America’s Workers</em>, launching a whole-of-government initiative to strengthen the use of federal procurement to support American manufacturing.</p>



<p>Since January, the Biden-Harris Administration has made significant progress implementing the President’s vision. In April, the President <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-27/biden-names-trade-expert-drake-as-made-in-america-director">opened</a> his new Made in America Office. The Office reviews proposed waivers of Made-in-America laws and helps agencies use taxpayer dollars to support U.S. manufacturing.</p>



<p>The Made in America Office issued new waiver guidance to fulfill the President’s commitment to scrutinize and reduce waivers to Made-in-America laws. The guidance lays out a whole of government agenda to maximize the use of taxpayer dollars on domestic products and services to strengthen our industrial base and create good-paying, union jobs for Americans.</p>



<p>Today, the President is announcing another significant step in fulfilling his commitment: the most robust changes to the implementation of the Buy American Act in almost 70 years. His proposal would increase U.S. content in the products the federal government buys and support the domestic production of products critical to our national and economic security.</p>



<p>With $600 billion in annual procurement spending, almost half of which is in manufactured products from helicopter blades to trucks to office furniture, the Federal government is a major buyer in a number of markets for goods and services, including the single largest purchaser of consumer goods in the world. Leveraging that purchasing power to shape markets and accelerate innovation is a key part of the Biden <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/commentary/transcript/brian-deese-on-bidens-vision-for-a-twenty-first-century-american-industrial-strategy/">industrial strategy</a> to grow the industries of the future to support U.S. workers, communities, and firms. As the pandemic has demonstrated, federal procurement can strengthen the resiliency of domestic supply chains, and reduce the risk of Americans being adversely impacted by the actions of competitor nations during a time of crisis.</p>



<p>Today’s Notice of Proposed Rulemaking marks just the first set of proposed reforms to procurement policy under the Biden-Harris Administration to ensure taxpayer dollars help America’s businesses compete in strategic industries and help ensure America&#8217;s workers thrive.</p>



<p>The proposed rule directs the following changes to strengthen Buy American requirements:</p>



<ul><li><strong>“Make Buy American Real” and close loopholes by raising the domestic content threshold. </strong>The Buy American statute says products bought with taxpayer dollars must “substantially all” be made in the U.S. However, today, products could qualify if just 55%&#8211;just over half—of the value of their component parts was manufactured here. The NPRM proposes an immediate increase of the threshold to 60% and a phased increase to 75%. This proposal would close a problematic loophole in the current regulation, while also allowing businesses time to adjust their supply chains to increase the use of American-made components. If adopted, this change would create more opportunities for small- and medium-sized manufacturers and their employees, including small and disadvantaged enterprises, from all parts of the country. To support this work, the Small Business Administration has created a new manufacturing office in its federal contracting division.</li><li><strong>Strengthens domestic supply chains for critical goods with new price preferences. </strong>As the pandemic made clear, supply chain disruptions can impact the health, safety, and livelihoods of Americans—leaving us without access to critical goods during a crisis. Some products are simply too important to our national and economic security to be dependent on foreign sources. The NPRM proposes applying enhanced price preferences to select critical products and components identified by the Critical Supply Chain review, mandated under E.O. 14017, and the pandemic supply chain strategy called for under E.O. 14001. These preferences, once in place, would support the development and expansion of domestic supply chains for critical products by providing a source of stable demand for domestically produced critical products.</li><li><strong>Increases transparency and accountability in Buy American rules.</strong> Reporting challenges have hampered implementation of Buy American rules for decades. Currently, contractors only tell the government if they meet the content threshold rather than reporting the total domestic content in their products. The NPRM proposes to establish a reporting requirement for critical products. The new reporting requirement would bolster compliance with the Buy American Act and improve data on the actual U.S. content of goods purchased. More complete and accurate data would be used to target future improvements to support America’s entrepreneurs, farmers, ranchers, and workers— and along the way, create good jobs and resilient communities.</li></ul>



<p><strong><u>THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION IS ALREADY BUYING AMERICAN</u></strong></p>



<p>The Biden-Harris Administration has not waited for new rules to go into place in order to Buy American. At his first Cabinet meeting, the President made it clear that supporting U.S.-based manufacturing through procurement was a top priority. Agencies have delivered.</p>



<p>As part of the whole-of-government initiative, today, agencies are highlighting more than $2 billion in new purchases to support the manufacturing of innovative technologies and products in America.</p>



<ul><li><strong>The Department of Energy</strong> acquired new electric vehicles for its fleet, all of which were manufactured in the US or have batteries that were produced at US facilities. The Department will also purchase steel products, advanced computing, and hazardous materials isolation equipment manufactured in Texas, Iowa, Idaho, Louisiana, South Carolina, Ohio, Connecticut and Wisconsin.</li><li><strong>The General Services Administration (GSA)</strong> worked with 8(a) small business to procure energy efficient technologies for federal facilities. These contracts are a part of GSA’s Green Proving Ground program, which tests emerging technologies at federal facilities in order to help them scale and become viable in the market.</li><li><strong>The Department of Defense</strong> funded prototypes to sustainably source critical minerals and to create a new training hub with the Department of Energy to increase the productivity of the U.S. machine tool base.</li><li><strong>NASA</strong> added new project recipients to its programs to rapidly acquire lunar delivery services from American companies to further U.S. capabilities for science, exploration, or commercial development of the Moon and to demonstrate a commercially-developed habitable space station elements with the potential to transition to free-flying, self-sustaining commercial destinations in low earth orbit.</li><li><strong>The Office of Naval Research</strong> issued Phase 1 awards for a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project to accelerate the pace, security and quality of autonomous vehicles.</li><li><strong>The Department of Labor</strong> purchased $1.5 million of Made in America products, spanning a range of needs from office furniture to state of the art testing equipment to ensure America’s mines and other workplaces are safe.</li><li><strong>The Army Corps of Engineers</strong> Mississippi Valley Division issued over $42 million in new contracts to help make communities more storm and flood resistant and to improve the flow of goods along the Mississippi River to support the region’s manufacturers.</li></ul>



<p>These purchases are aligned with the President’s commitment in his Build Back Better legislative proposal to strengthen R&amp;D, manufacturing and grow jobs in the industries of the future, including through a $48 billion commitment to federal procurement of clean energy and clean technologies.</p>



<p>The President’s COVID-19 response has also advanced his Buy American strategy by increasing U.S. capacity to produce critical products.</p>



<ul><li>In March, the Department of Defense and Department of Health and Human Services procured over $22 million in American-made cloth face masks for communities hard-hit by the pandemic.</li><li>In May and June, the Department of Defense purchased more than $1.8 billion in U.S.-made COVID treatment and testing supplies.</li><li>In addition, since February, we have invested more than a billion dollars in expanding American production capacity for critical pandemic response throughout the healthcare supply chain to meet current and future needs.</li></ul>



<p>The President’s Build Back Better agenda will continue this work through its call for $30 billion to prevent and prepare for future pandemics.</p>



<p>Beyond direct purchasing, the Biden-Harris Administration is making investments in workforce training and small business supports that will bolster the President’s Made in America agenda. As noted above, SBA has created a new manufacturing office to help small manufacturers access federal contracts, financing, and business development support. The office will coordinate activities across the Agency in response to the President’s Executive Orders on Made-in-America, supply chain resiliency, and racial equity.</p>



<p>The Department of Labor invested $430 million in workforce training and apprenticeships in June this year, including grantees focused on bolstering the domestic manufacturing workforce. The funding supports programs across the country, including in Colorado, Texas, California, Michigan, Idaho and Nevada. These investments will ensure that as the manufacturing sector expands, workers will be able to transition quickly and succeed in good-quality jobs.</p>

<p>Today Vice President Kamala Harris hosted a discussion in her ceremonial office to engage with Tribal leaders and leaders from American Indian and Alaska Native communities about voting rights. She was joined by Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland. The Vice President thanked the participants for their work to protect voting rights, and they discussed ways to make voting more accessible.<br>&nbsp;<br>During the meeting, the leaders shared how Native Americans have long faced challenges to exercise their fundamental right to vote&#8211;from the long distance voters must travel to reach their polling places to anti-voter laws that directly impact Tribal communities. The leaders also shared how they are engaging voters&#8211;and in particular young voters&#8211;in their communities, by connecting the issues they care about to their vote.<br>&nbsp;<br>In her role leading the Biden-Harris Administration’s efforts on voting rights, the Vice President is working with a broad coalition to protect and strengthen the right to vote. The Vice President has convened Americans from all walks of life to share their stories and provide input – including a meeting the Vice President held last week with poll workers to hear about their experiences helping voters cast their ballot and have their ballots counted.<br>&nbsp;<br>The leaders who participated in today’s meeting included:</p>



<ul><li>Secretary Deb Haaland, (Pueblo of Laguna)</li><li>President Kevin Killer, (Oglala Lakota Nation) (SD)</li><li>Allie Young, (Dine’ or Navajo Nation) (AZ)</li><li>Chairwoman Shelly Fyant, (Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes) (Bitterroot-Salish) (MT)</li><li>Julie Kitka, (President of the Alaska Federation of Natives) (Chugach Eskimo Village of Nuchek) (AK)</li><li>Prairie Rose Seminole, (Three Affiliated Tribes of Mandan Hidatsa and Arikara) (ND)</li></ul>

<p class="has-text-align-center">National Counterterrorism Center<br>Liberty Crossing Intelligence Campus<br>McLean, Virginia</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; It’s an honor to be here.&nbsp; I guess you all are the ones that lost the lottery, huh?&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; You had to be here in person.<br>&nbsp;<br>Well, I&#8217;d like to thank Director Haines and Director of the National Counterterrorism Center, Christy Abizaid, for showing me around the watch floor.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Folks, the main reason I came &#8212; and I mean this sincerely &#8212; is to say thank you.&nbsp; Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.&nbsp; The American people, almost by definition, are not able to know what you do.&nbsp; And you devote so much of your time, your effort, and many of you end up risking your lives in the Intelligence Community to do things to make sure that your families and people back here are safe &#8212; make a difference.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And you&#8217;d be amazed &#8212; as I traveled the world as Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee or member of the Intelligence Committee for all those years, or as Vice President of the United States dealing with national security issues, or as President of the United States &#8212; how many of now my foreign counterparts thank you for what you do.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>I&#8217;d like to introduce you, by the way, to my National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan.&nbsp; Jake, would you stand up?&nbsp; (Applause.)<br>&nbsp;<br>And, you know, the leaders of many of our intelligence agencies are here today.&nbsp; And I thank you for your diligence and keeping our country safe, and your commitment to supporting your teams.&nbsp; Because, if there’s anything, a team sport is what y’all are doing if there&#8217;s going to be anything that’s going to be accomplished.<br>&nbsp;<br>Because the people I most want to honor and thank today are the intelligence professionals whose names the public is never, ever going to know, never have any notion of what you’ve done for us: the analysts; the linguists; the collectors and field officers; scientists; support staff; so many others who are real experts, whose careers started much longer before my administration and whose service to our nation is going to extend well beyond my presidency.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>You know, you&#8217;re the eyes and ears around the world &#8212; in the frontlines of our national defense, and in many cases, for the world, through us.&nbsp; And you serve the American people no matter which political party holds power in Congress or the White House.&nbsp; It’s so vital &#8212; so vital that you are and should be totally free of any political pressure or partisan interference.&nbsp; That’s basic.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And I want to be absolutely clear that my administration is getting us back to the basics.&nbsp; To the basics.&nbsp; I promise you:&nbsp; You will never see a time, while I&#8217;m President of the United States, when my administration in any way tries to affect or alter your judgments about what you think the situation we face is.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll never politicize the work you do.&nbsp; You have my word on that.&nbsp; It’s too important for our country.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Getting back to basics also making &#8212; to make sure the IC scrupulously acts within the legal constraints and abides by our strong traditions of internal and congressional oversight, including respect for whistleblower protections.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And it also means understanding that much of the work you must do is in secret but necessary and for the sake of safety.&nbsp; But we should strive to be as open as possible with the American people about the nature of the threats we face and just how serious they are &#8212; and they are.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Every one of you joined up because you believe in being part of something that’s bigger than yourself, especially you guys and women in uniform &#8212; bigger than yourself.&nbsp; You’re patriots.&nbsp; It’s a word that we use lightly, but I mean it.&nbsp; It’s not &#8212; it’s not &#8212; I don’t use it lightly.&nbsp; I really don’t.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>My son, who spent a year in Iraq and died, he was a patriot.&nbsp; He wasn’t just somebody else.&nbsp; You all are patriots.&nbsp; You risk your lives and your sacred honor for all that we need to have done for us.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And you believe in the American idea.&nbsp; And living up to that idea is embracing democratic values that are our greatest strength at the end of the day, leading not just by the example of our power, but by the power of your example.&nbsp; The power of your example.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>In addition to thanking you for your bravery, integrity, and your sacrifices, I want to make it clear to everyone here today and to the members of the Intelligence Community working around the globe that you have my full confidence.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>That’s doesn’t mean I don’t question what you send me.&nbsp; That meant &#8212; doesn’t mean &#8212; it’s not that I &#8212; I &#8212; you know, I&#8217;m not a new guy on the block in terms of these issues.&nbsp; But one of the reasons I question is to push &#8212; push you to the limits to determine just how certain you are about what you&#8217;re doing.&nbsp; Lots of times, the only honest answer: “We’re not certain.&nbsp; We’re not certain, but this is what our best judgment is.”<br>&nbsp;<br>I know &#8212; I really do &#8212; know how hard the work you do is.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve been doing this for a long, long time before I became President.&nbsp; I know there’s no such thing as 100 percent certainty in the intelligence world.&nbsp; Occasionally that happens, but rarely, rarely, rarely.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>But I also know that your work is invaluable to our ability to make informed, strategic national security decisions.&nbsp; And I just had an interesting meeting, as you all know, with my very close friend, Vladimir Putin.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; I can tell &#8212; one thing: I&#8217;ve been dealing with world leaders a long, long time.&nbsp; And just like all of you men and women, you can sort of sense somebody else after a while.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>He knows that you&#8217;re better than his team, and it bothers the hell out of him.&nbsp; Not a joke.&nbsp; Not a joke.&nbsp; And he, as a consequence of you, think we have capacities he may even exaggerate.&nbsp; That’s a good thing.&nbsp; That’s a good thing.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>You know, one of the things I miss most during the four years between my time serving as Vice President and being a professor in a college &#8212; and I mean this sincerely: From the time I was 31 years old, every morning I woke up and got in the train to come to &#8212; I commuted every day from Delaware after my wife and daughter were killed.&nbsp; And I&#8217;d come every day, and one of the things I would get &#8212; I&#8217;d get a brief in the morning.&nbsp; And I was more informed than 99 percent of the American people.&nbsp; You know what I miss most, for real, from those four years of being a professor?&nbsp; The PDB.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; No, you think I&#8217;m joking.&nbsp; I am not.&nbsp; A sense of knowing where all the pieces were.&nbsp; Whether we had it all down, we knew where all the pieces were.&nbsp; We knew where the pieces were.<br>&nbsp;<br>And so now I have access again &#8212; and to the chagrin of many of you, I read it in detail.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; And I ask questions of my briefers and follow up with my team.&nbsp; And I ask each of you the same thing I asked Director Haines, &#8220;Just give it to me straight.&#8221;&nbsp; I&#8217;m not looking for pablum; I&#8217;m looking for straight-from-the-shoulder assessments.&nbsp; And when you&#8217;re not sure, say you&#8217;re not sure.&nbsp; But give me your best judgment of what you think is &#8212; your best judgment is better than almost anybody else&#8217;s judgment in the whole world &#8212; even if the news is hard, even if the news is bad.<br>&nbsp;<br>I can’t make the decisions I need to make if I&#8217;m not getting the best unvarnished, unbiased judgments you can give me.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not looking to hear nice things.&nbsp; I&#8217;m looking to hear what you think to be the truth.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>I greatly appreciate just how much work goes into the analysis that the IC produces and the tactical and intelligence supporting our warfighters and the superb effort to ensure our IT, our human capital, and the facilities are the best in the world.&nbsp; Because, again, without knowing what &#8212; without you telling me, I don’t know enough to know what to ask for from the Congress &#8212; how much money we need, what we need to focus on.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>It’s a massive, coordinated, global effort to pull together reliable intelligence in a timely way.&nbsp; And all of you, no matter which agency you work for, are part of one team with one shared mission: keeping America strong and secure in the world, or simply making sure your families are safe.&nbsp; It gets down to basic things.&nbsp; Just really basic things.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>You know, for most of the last 20 years, much of the work has been focused on counterterrorism, making sure the United States doesn’t experience another horror like occurred on September the 11th.&nbsp; And that work has to continue and evolve to address the changing shape of terrorism as we find it today.&nbsp;<br>And that’s no great insight on my part, it&#8217;s going to change significantly more.&nbsp; It&#8217;s going to change significantly more.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>I always get kidded by my colleagues when I served in the Senate for 36 years for quoting Irish poets.&nbsp; They think I quoted Irish poets because I&#8217;m Irish.&nbsp; That’s not the reason I quote them; they&#8217;re simply the best poets in the world.&nbsp; (Laughter.)<br>&nbsp;<br>And there&#8217;s a famous poem written by &#8212; that says, &#8220;All has changed, changed utterly.&nbsp; A terrible beauty has been born.&#8221;&nbsp; The world is changing so rapidly &#8212; technologically and in terms of alliances and human intercourse &#8212; that war is going to change across the board in the next 10 years than in the last 50 years.&nbsp; That’s not hyperbole; that&#8217;s a fact.<br>&nbsp;<br>If I talked to you 15 years ago about hypersonic flight, you&#8217;d look at me like I was crazy.&nbsp; So much is going to change and that’s going to put an enormous burden on you to stay ahead of the curve.&nbsp; It&#8217;s really going to get tougher.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>But we have the best folks in the world.&nbsp; And one of the things that I think &#8212; and I don’t want to get off too far afield here, but one of the things that is really important is &#8212; our greatest strength, in fact, is our diversity, bringing completely different perspectives to it.&nbsp; And I really mean that.&nbsp; That’s not hyperbole.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not trying to be &#8220;Kumbaya, everybody get along.&#8221;&nbsp; It&#8217;s just a fact.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a fact.<br>&nbsp;<br>And so, threats that are more geographically dispersed than they were 20 years ago are going to continue to require our vigilance.&nbsp; And we have to continue our efforts to better understand some of the hardest and most important intelligence targets we face as a nation.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>But, you know, we also need to make sure that we’re positioning ourselves to stay ahead of security challenges that will stretch the IC in new ways it has never been stretched before.<br>&nbsp;<br>You know, we’ve seen how cyber threats, including ransomware attacks, increasingly are able to cause damage and disruption to the real world. &nbsp;I can&#8217;t guarantee this, and you&#8217;re as informed as I am, but I think it&#8217;s more likely we&#8217;re going to end up &#8212; well, if we end up in a war, a real shooting war with a major power, it&#8217;s going to be as a consequence of a cyber breach of great consequence. &nbsp;And it&#8217;s increasing exponentially &#8212; the capabilities.<br>&nbsp;<br>When I was with Mr. Putin, who has a real problem &#8212; he is &#8212; he&#8217;s sitting on top of an economy that has nuclear weapons and oil wells and nothing else.&nbsp; Nothing else.&nbsp; Their economy is &#8212; what? &#8212; the eighth smallest in the world now &#8212; largest in the world?&nbsp; He knows &#8212; he knows he&#8217;s in real trouble, which makes him even more dangerous, in my view.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Take a look at China.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve spent more time with Xi Jinping as a world leader than anyone else has.&nbsp; I spent 25 hours alone with him when I was Vice President because it was important that, according to President Obama, that someone knew who the new guy coming on board was, and it couldn’t be the President.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>I traveled 17,000 miles with him.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve sat with him, with me and just an interpreter &#8212; each of us have a simultaneous interpreter.&nbsp; He is deadly earnest about becoming the most powerful military force in the world, as well as the largest &#8212; the most prominent economy in the world by the mid-40s &#8212; the 2040s.&nbsp; It&#8217;s real.<br>&nbsp;<br>I don’t know.&nbsp; We probably have some people who aren’t totally cleared &#8212; I don’t know, but you saw just what we found out about hypersonic &#8212; we &#8212; anyway, as they say in Southern Delaware, &#8220;This boy has got a plan.&#8221;&nbsp; And, you know, we better figure out how we&#8217;re going to keep pace without exacerbating and moving us in a position where we increase the hostilities unnecessarily.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>I think we also need to take on the rampant disinformation that is making it harder and harder for people to access &#8212; assess the facts, be able to make decisions.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>In today&#8217;s PDB you all prepared for me, look what Russia is doing already about the 2022 elections and misinformation.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a pure violation of our sovereignty.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Now you see what&#8217;s happening.&nbsp; More people get their information from the Internet than they do from any other outlet.&nbsp; What&#8217;s &#8212; all the disinformation that&#8217;s having real consequences in terms of people&#8217;s access.<br>&nbsp;<br>And so, there&#8217;s so much that you all &#8212; particularly those of you who are new and coming along &#8212; are going to have to be &#8212; keep up with and ahead of in ways that are not even happening now, as good as everything is.<br>&nbsp;<br>You know, as we compete for the future of the 21st century with China and other nations, we have to stay on top of the cutting-edge developments of science and technology.<br>&nbsp;<br>If you&#8217;d hold for a second here, I want to point out something.&nbsp; You know, we used to &#8212; we used to be, when I first got here as a U.S. senator, actually three and a half decades ago, we invested more money &#8212; R&amp;D &#8212; money in R&amp;D as a percent of our GDP than any nation in the world.&nbsp; We&#8217;re now number eight.&nbsp; China was number nine; they&#8217;re now number two.&nbsp; It matters.&nbsp; It matters.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Look at where we are on things that intelligence communities and others don&#8217;t even think very often about &#8212; about how educated the public is.&nbsp; We&#8217;re coming around right now.&nbsp; This doesn&#8217;t relate to the intelligence community per se, but it does.<br>&nbsp;<br>Think about it.&nbsp; If we were having the debate that was taking place in the United States in the late 1890s and the early 1900s about public education, do you think any of us would say 12 years of free public education was enough to compete in the 21st century?&nbsp; Not a joke.&nbsp; Think about it.&nbsp; What do you think?&nbsp; I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s a shot if we were doing that today.<br>&nbsp;<br>So the fact we have the best-educated public in the world &#8212; well, that&#8217;s our objective &#8212; will matter a great deal.&nbsp; It will matter a great deal.&nbsp; It is as much a part of national defense, in my view, as anything else is.<br>&nbsp;<br>So I think we have to think differently.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t expect you to agree with me.&nbsp; I expect you to at least understand where I&#8217;m coming from because the world is changing so significantly.<br>&nbsp;<br>And it&#8217;s especially important that we work closely with our partners and allies to maintain our technological edge; shore up supply chains; ensure that the rules that govern technologies support democracies, not autocracies.<br>&nbsp;<br>You know, at the same time, we have to work in cooperation with nations like China and Russia that are our competitors &#8212; and possibly mortal competitors down the road &#8212; in the context of there&#8217;s &#8212; to meet the existential threats, for example, of climate change.&nbsp; There are certain things that are in our mutual interest.&nbsp; But we can&#8217;t &#8212; we can&#8217;t be lulled into thinking that that&#8217;s enough and that we don&#8217;t really have to keep a watchful eye on what the ultimate objective of the other team is.&nbsp; But there are things where we should be &#8212; where we should be cooperating.<br>&nbsp;<br>This shared danger impacts all of nations.&nbsp; Climate challenges are already accelerating instability in our own country and around the world: extreme weather events that are more common and more deadly; food and water insecurity; sea levels rising, resulting in changing climates and driving greater migration and posing fundamental risk to the most vulnerable of communities.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>If you could hold for just a second again.&nbsp; We&#8217;re in a situation where &#8212; think about this.&nbsp; Think about this: I&#8217;ll never forget the first time I went down in the tank as Vice President, after I got elected.&nbsp; The Defense Department said what the greatest threat facing America: climate change.<br>&nbsp;<br>If, in fact, the seas’ level rises another two and half feet, you&#8217;re going to have millions of people migrating, fighting over arable land.&nbsp; You saw what happened in North Africa.&nbsp; What makes us think this doesn&#8217;t matter?&nbsp; It&#8217;s not your responsibility, but it&#8217;s something you&#8217;re watching because you know what&#8217;s going to happen.<br>&nbsp;<br>People who were Muslim, and the only difference was Black and/or Arab, killing each other by the thousands for arable &#8212; a piece of arable &#8212; arable land in North Central Africa.&nbsp; But what happens &#8212; what happens in Indonesia if the projections are correct that, in the next 10 years, they may have to move their capital because they&#8217;re going to be underwater?<br>&nbsp;<br>It matters.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a strategic question as well as an environmental question.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>A dramatically warming Arctic is opening up competition for resources that once were hard to access.&nbsp; I had &#8212; as they say in Southern Delaware &#8212; they talk at you like this, you know what I mean?&nbsp;&#8212; I had a &#8220;Come to Jesus&#8221; meeting, an “altar call” with Mr. Putin about what he thinks is what Russia&#8217;s property is in the Arctic.&nbsp; China looking very closely at that as well, where they are.<br>&nbsp;<br>That&#8217;s what I mean about the world changing.&nbsp; What is that going to do to our strategic doctrine in the next 2, 5, 10, 12 years, when you can circumvent the Arctic without icebreakers?<br>&nbsp;<br>So, look, we need your insight, we need your expertise on all these issues.&nbsp; The one thing you all have in common is you all have high IQs.&nbsp; You&#8217;re all smart.&nbsp; You have significant intelligence quotients, and you put it to use to help the elected leaders in this country decide what the best route to go is.<br>&nbsp;<br>So just as you always have been essential as we’ve sought to counter traditional threats, the Intelligence Community is going to be critical to America’s strength as we take on these new challenges and hybrid threats.<br>&nbsp;<br>Finally, I’ve laid out a broad agenda, and that’s just a fraction of it.&nbsp; But we can’t do any of this without taking care of our best and most important asset: the American people.<br>&nbsp;<br>I know the intelligence community is already one of the best places to work in the federal government.&nbsp; I asked my staff when I found out you came in second just after NASA &#8212; I said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t tell me what the White House is ranked.&#8221;&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; “It will hurt my feelings.”&nbsp; And they assured me, no, you don’t rank them.&nbsp; That was a good thing: “We don’t rank the Oval Office.”&nbsp; (Laughter.)<br>&nbsp;<br>But all kidding aside, it’s about the comradery you have, and most of all, it’s about being able to trust one another &#8212; to trust one another.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>My highest priority as President is the safety and security of all Americans, and that includes those who serve in our Intelligence Community.<br>&nbsp;<br>You take on unique risks in these jobs, and we’re taking the cases of anomalous health incidents that are affecting intelligence officers, government officials, and their families very seriously, for example.<br>&nbsp;<br>My administration is coordinating a government-wide effort to respond to these incidents, because this challenge demands &#8212; demands that departments and agencies, including the entire Intelligence Community, work together with urgency.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Talked about changes.&nbsp; What&#8217;s going to happen as we move on and we’re able to develop around the world pathogens that can be transmitted to societies and communities?&nbsp; It may not be a nuclear weapon.&nbsp; It may not be a hypersonic missile.&nbsp; It may not be any of the things we think of.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>But think about it.&nbsp; Just think about what&#8217;s happened with one &#8212; I&#8217;m not suggesting it was intended &#8212; a lot more we need to know &#8212; but think what&#8217;s happened: More people have been killed in the United States of America because of COVID than in every single major war we fought combined.&nbsp; Every single one.&nbsp; What&#8217;s next?&nbsp; What is intended?&nbsp; There&#8217;s a lot of research going on.&nbsp; You&#8217;re going to find &#8212; you&#8217;re going to have to increase your ranks with people with significant scientific capacity relative to pathogens.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So, my point is: Your value is going to increase and increase and increase and increase in terms of security.&nbsp; You know, from the CIA to all the agencies, there&#8217;s a lot that’s going to happen.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And to all of you who’ve been affected, we recognize how important it is to make sure that they have the best possible care at a time you&#8217;re figuring out how to deal with what&#8217;s happening, not only to some of those who have been stationed abroad, but their families.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Look, this is a priority for our entire leadership team.&nbsp; So let me just close by saying how much I value the work you do.&nbsp; That’s why I wanted to come here today.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So much of the work you do is in secret.&nbsp; It means many, many times you don’t get credit &#8212; the credit you deserve &#8212; and the things you prevented from happening, the catastrophes you’ve enabled us to avoid, the judgments you’ve provided us to make our people safer.<br>&nbsp;<br>And America is probably never going to learn about the lives you’ve saved or the disasters that never come to pass because of your diligent, professional intelligence work.&nbsp; But I want you to know I know.&nbsp; For the time being, at least as long as I’m around, I know.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And on behalf of the American people, thank you all for what you do every single day.&nbsp; And we’re grateful &#8212; we’re grateful that you’re there for us.&nbsp; We’re safer because of your dedication, your honesty, your integrity, and your significant intellectual capacity to act in our interest.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>We’re stronger because of your insight.&nbsp; We’re a more noble nation because of your insight.&nbsp; And American lives have been saved repeatedly because of your insight. I know it may sound like hyperbole, but from the bottom of my heart, I thank you.&nbsp; I thank you for all you do and continue to do.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And may God bless you all.&nbsp; And may God protect our troops and all those patriots serving in harm’s way, because there&#8217;s a lot still there.&nbsp; Thank you, thank you, thank you.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br>&nbsp;<br>I have to seek permission to leave.&nbsp; I had to check, if you noticed.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Thank you again.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; President Biden, will you require federal employees to get vaccinated?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Beg your pardon?<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will you require all federal employees to get vaccinated?<br>&nbsp;<br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; That’s under consideration right now.&nbsp; But if you&#8217;re not vaccinated, you&#8217;re not nearly as smart as I thought you were.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are you concerned that the CDC’s mask guidance could sow confusion?<br>&nbsp;<br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; We have a pandemic because of the unvaccinated, and they&#8217;re sowing enormous confusion.&nbsp; And the more we learn &#8212; the more we learn about this virus and the Delta variation, the more we have to be worried and concerned.&nbsp; And only one thing we know for sure:&nbsp;If those other hundred million people got vaccinated, we’d be in a very different world.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So, get vaccinated.&nbsp; If you haven’t, you’re not nearly as smart as I said you were.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Thanks.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br>&nbsp;<br>END</p>
