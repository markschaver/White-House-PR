<p class="has-text-align-center">James S. Brady Press Briefing Room</p>



<p>3:05 P.M. EDT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Hi, everyone.&nbsp; Hello.&nbsp; Okay, a couple of items for all of you at the top.</p>



<p>As you know, the President is headed to the West Coast tomorrow, and I wanted to give you a quick preview of his first trip to Oregon and Washington.&nbsp; He will highlight the historic economic growth and nearly 8 million jobs created as a result of his and congressional Democrats’ actions, including the American Rescue Plan and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and his work to lower costs.</p>



<p>He will visit Portland International Airport tomorrow to highlight critical investments to ensure stronger, more resilient infrastructure, such as an earthquake-resilient runway at the Portland Airport, and to help lower costs on everyday items by ensuring goods can move faster and more efficiently.</p>



<p>Governor Kate Brown, Senators Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley, and Congressman Kurt Schrader will join the President at the airport.</p>



<p>On Friday, he will mark Earth Day in Seattle, Washington, by speaking to the need to bolster our nation’s resilience in the face of threats like wildfire, and the need to rapidly deploy clean energy.&nbsp; He will be joined at the event by Governor Jay Inslee.</p>



<p>The President will also discuss how he is fighting to bring down prescription drug costs, such as insulin, where he will be joined by Governor Inslee, Senators Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell, and Congresswoman Kim Schrier.</p>



<p>The President will call on Congress to pass his plan to lower prescription drug prices and energy costs, but he’s not waiting for Congress to act.&nbsp; And he will highlight recent actions he’s taken to lower energy and healthcare costs, and give families more breathing room.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Those actions from just the last few weeks include: a historic release from the &#8212; from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, extending the use of E15 gasoline, taking 100 actions this year that would save families more than $100 annually on their utility bills, finalizing standards for cars and trucks that will allow drivers to travel further on every gallon of fuel, fixing the “family glitch” in the ACA, reducing the burden of medical debt, freezing student loan payments through August, and helping 3.6 million student loan borrowers move closer to debt forgiveness.</p>



<p>Also wanted to note on that front: Yesterday, you may have seen, as part of the administration’s historic commitment to support student loan borrowers and get borrowers the relief they are eligible for, the Department of Education announced changes that will move more than 3.6 million borrowers closer to student debt forgiveness; make 40,000 borrowers eligible for the immediate discharge of their loans under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program; provide immediate relief to thousands of borrowers in income-driven repayment plans.</p>



<p>We’re delivering this relief to borrowers by fixing longstanding failures in the income-driven repayment program &#8212; or “IDR,” as it’s often known.</p>



<p>Income-driven repayment is one of the best options borrowers who have &#8212; they have towards tackling their student loan debt.&nbsp; For too long, the system for tracking payments has been broken.&nbsp; And there were significant flaws that suggested borrowers who were entitled to forgiveness were missing out on their &#8212; on their progress toward debt forgiveness.</p>



<p>So, these steps include making sure that any months in which borrowers made payments will count toward IDR forgiveness, regardless of the repayment plan, and any borrower who has made the required number of payments for IDR forgiveness based on this payment-count revision will receive loan cancellation automatically.</p>



<p>Additionally, we know that in past &#8212; in the past, loan servicers placed borrowers who were struggling to manage repayment into forbearances without giving them adequate information about alternatives.</p>



<p>And that meant, in forbearance, while no payments were due, interest continued to accrue and borrowers did not get credit toward IDR forgiveness.&nbsp; This was often not the best option for borrowers, particularly when they would be eligible for an economic hardship deferment or a low or zero payment on an IDR plan.</p>



<p>And to make sure that existing borrowers aren’t permanently harmed by these failures, the Department will apply PSLF and IDR credit for borrowers who ended up in long-term forbearance.&nbsp; Those are forbearances of 12 or more consecutive months, or 36 or more total months.</p>



<p>So, important steps on that front.</p>



<p>The last thing I just wanted to note &#8212; and you may have seen this &#8212; but this morning, the Department of Treasury sanctioned Trans- &#8212; Transcapitalbank, a key Russian commercial bank that has offered services to banks globally to evade international sanctions, and more than 40 individuals and entities that are part of a Russian sanctions evasion network led by Russian oligarch Konstantin Malofeyev.</p>



<p>We have also imposed sanctions on companies in Russia’s virtual currency mining industry that operate vast server farms and provide revenue to the Russian government.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And the Department of State imposed visa restrictions on more than 600 individuals in response to human rights abuses by Russia and Belarus.</p>



<p>So, this is part of our stepped-up effort to crack down on those attempting to evade our unprecedented sanctions.</p>



<p>With that, Darlene, why don’t you kick us off.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; A couple of questions on masking.&nbsp; The President said yesterday that people should decide for themselves whether to wear masks on airplanes.&nbsp; And I’m wondering whether his comment was intended to signal a shift in thinking in the administration away from mandates toward more personal responsibility.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, the question &#8212; the President was answering the question quite literally, which means, right now, as you know, we are not implementing the mask mandate because of the court order, which we disagree with, while he is still abiding by CDC guidance.&nbsp; And we recommend Americans do that across the country.&nbsp; They’re still recommending people wear masks on airplanes; on Air Force One &#8212; which, of course, is a federal, not a private, plane.&nbsp; We all wore masks on the plane when we traveled to New Hampshire yesterday.</p>



<p>But we are not le- &#8212; people are not legally bound to wear masks.&nbsp; So, it is a point in time where it is up to people &#8212; it is their choice, in that regard.</p>



<p>Q    And then, one other question, actually, on a different topic, in the interest of time here today.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are you able to confirm reports that the President is replacing the Acting ATF Director with another gentleman who will also be the Acting ATF Director until the person he nominated last week is confirmed by the Senate?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; So, I know there have been reports about this out there.&nbsp; And I will say that the President is making the designation under the Vacancies Reform Act, which, of course, says that any President, and only the President, may direct a person who serves in an office for which appointment is required to be made by the President, by and with the advice and consent of Senate, to perform the functions and duties of the vacant office temporarily.</p>



<p>We, of course, are strongly advocating for and pushing for his eminently qualified nominee to be confirmed and have an ATF confirmed Director for the first time in many years, which is something we would be eager to see happen.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; On the long-range missile test today, Putin says this is meant to provide “food for thought” for those who threaten Russia.&nbsp; Can you talk us through how the administration is interpreting this and whether you’re viewing this as a warning or a threat in any way?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We are not &#8212; they were &#8212; they notified under the START Treaty, and so, from our perspective, while we &#8212; they provided advance notice of this launch under its New START Treaty obligations that have planned to test this missile, the Defense Department said today that we did not deem the test a threat to the United States or its allies, and the timing of the scope of Russia&#8217;s missile tests do not influence our approach to countering Russia&#8217;s further invasion of Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, it was noticed through the proper process and the Department of Defense has spoken to this as well.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And on an unexpected announcement of another round of assistance to Ukraine, could you walk us through any specifics, if you have any, on that and when that&#8217;s happening?&nbsp;</p>



<p>And just big picture on this: The U.S. has already given more than $2.5 billion since this war started.&nbsp; How long can the U.S. expect to continue to bankroll so much of this war?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, okay, there&#8217;s a couple questions there, so let me do my best in answering them.</p>



<p>First, we are working, of course, around the clock, as you know, to provide security assistance to Ukraine.&nbsp; And just to give you an example of how that assistance has flowed, just in the last few days &#8212; and I think I gave an update the other day &#8212; but five flights with military assistance have arrived in the region over the last few days.&nbsp; More than half a dozen flights from the United States are scheduled to land in the region shortly with additional equipment.</p>



<p>And as we look at providing this assistance, which I know &#8212; I&#8217;ll go back to the first part of your question, of course &#8212; but what we&#8217;ve tried to do &#8212; we made a strategic decision given we&#8217;ve seen Russia reposition their troops and their military to the eastern part of Ukraine to fight a different kind of war on the ground, which will be more, you know, kind of shooting back and forth through long range.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so, we have been working with Ukrainians and the Ukrainian military to determine exactly the kind of security assistance they need for this stage in the war.&nbsp; And that has included an increase, as you&#8217;ve seen, in artillery and ammunition and weapons, like Howitzers and others, that can do these sorts of &#8212; they can &#8212; are effective in this long-range shooting and long-range fighting that we are seeing or we anticipate will happen in this stage of the war.</p>



<p>So, we have been expediting this assistance to the ground over the last couple of weeks to ensure they are prepared as this &#8212; as this portion of the war is starting &#8212; not because they are using all of it in in seven days, but because we want them to have all of this equipment as quickly as possible as they prepare to fight this war on the ground.</p>



<p>In terms of assistance and what we will be &#8212; what we&#8217;re preparing or the reports that I know have been out there, I will say I expect we&#8217;ll have more soon on this, but I have nothing to preview at this point in time.</p>



<p>I would note that out of the $3.5 billion in drawdown authority Congress granted for this fiscal year, we&#8217;ve used over $2.4 billion so far to provide Ukraine the military equipment and capabilities they need to defend themselves.</p>



<p>So, obviously, there&#8217;s more of that approved drawdown assistance that we can provide.&nbsp; And we&#8217;ve been working to expedite and ensure, as I noted, that it&#8217;s meeting exactly the needs they have at this point in the war.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had a couple quick ones on masks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The DOJ said yesterday that they would decide, essentially, whether or not to appeal that ruling based on what the CDC says they need or don&#8217;t need.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the White House or the Cabinet involved in any way in that decision-making process?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, we are entirely able to and legally able to be a part of the discussion, but right now it&#8217;s &#8212; we, of course, are deferring to the CDC on what they believe is needed at this moment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They have already &#8212; they obviously put in place this two-week extension because they felt they needed that to take a look at the data, given that we&#8217;ve seen a rise in cases.&nbsp; So, we certainly anticipate to hear more from them soon on their ask for being able to have that time, which we think is entirely warranted.</p>



<p>And the Department of Justice, as you noted, has indicated that they would appeal not just because they think it&#8217;s entirely reasonable, of course, to have this additional time to look at it, but because they think that the current &#8212; for current and future public health crises, we want to preserve that authority for the CDC to have in the future.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then just &#8212; when you said a moment ago that it literally is a personal choice as to whether people are &#8212; decide to put a mask on or not on planes, is &#8212; does that messaging still reflect a shift for you all &#8212; and, maybe to some degree, a capitulation &#8212; to just the mood of the public about wanting to be over this pandemic or people who have politicized the wearing of masks in the first place?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, first, I would say we continue to recommend everyone wear masks on planes.</p>



<p>What the President was speaking to is, of course, because we are not currently implementing the mask mandate, it is not a requirement.&nbsp; So, people can choose, even as we recommend it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But to be clear: We are recommending everyone wear masks on planes.&nbsp; That is what the CDC is recommending.&nbsp; That is the public health guidance we are following.</p>



<p>I would note &#8212; I know this is often said and maybe some of it is because there was the video of people on planes &#8212; on the plane &#8212; on one plane taking off their masks: Public polling does not actually show that there is a universal view of people getting rid of masks.&nbsp; That&#8217;s not actually what public polling shows.</p>



<p>Now, it doesn&#8217;t matter to us because we are making our decisions based on public health and data and what the CDC is recommending.&nbsp; But that is not the universal view of the public.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, a Ukrainian commander in Mariupol is saying that his forces and civilians in the area may only have hours to make it out alive, and he has been making this direct plea to the President for the U.S. to somehow be involved in extracting people from the area.&nbsp; Do you know if that&#8217;s a request that the President himself is aware of?&nbsp; And can you just walk us through &#8212; can the U.S. be directly involved at this point in making that happen or helping to make that happen?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; We have certainly seen these &#8212; these cries for help and these asks for help.&nbsp; What &#8212; we certainly urge the Russian government to do the right thing: guarantee safe passage for any civilians or others who wish to leave the city.&nbsp; We also encourage them to allow deliveries of humanitarian aid, such as food and medicine and safe passage for volunteers to help people in need. &nbsp;But I don&#8217;t have any additional updates from here.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And quickly, on the President and whether he might visit Ukraine, you&#8217;ve obviously said a couple of times: Currently, there are no plans to do that.&nbsp; Yesterday, when he was asked “Are you going?,” he said he wasn&#8217;t sure.&nbsp; Is a trip completely off the table for now for him?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Nothing has changed in our assessment.&nbsp; I would also note, as I&#8217;ve said in here before, if anyone were to visit Ukraine from the United States, it&#8217;s not something we would announce in advance, confirm in advance, give details on who, if, and when because of security reasons.</p>



<p>And that&#8217;s something I think anyone who&#8217;s traveled to a war zone with a President or a Vice President or anyone is quite familiar with that policy.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So when he said he didn&#8217;t know, was he trying to indicate that it could be on the table?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Nothing has changed in our plans.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have one more &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&#8212; one more question.&nbsp; There, obviously, are so many horrific images coming out of Ukraine.&nbsp; They are very readily available photographs, videos of civilian deaths.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we enter the third month of this conflict, can you walk us through &#8212; give us a sense of how the President himself has been sort of processing these images?&nbsp; Who does he talk to?&nbsp; What does he lean on as he processes images that, you know, coming from what he himself has called a genocide?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah, look, I will say that the President is processing these images, as many Americans are &#8212; with horror; with sadness; with, you know, fear for the people of Ukraine &#8212; for the families, for the children, for innocent civilians who are at risk.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is &#8212; obviously, this conflict is consuming a great deal of his time, as much as he is working on a range of other priorities here, but he is consuming them as many people are &#8212; as I am, as many of you are, as Americans out there watching all of your networks are.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s emotional.&nbsp; It is &#8212; you know, watching some of these images is very raw for people, including the President, because you&#8217;re seeing people suffering at the hands of a dictator who is brutally targeting civilians.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few on Ukraine for you.&nbsp; Does the fact that the U.S. is committing heavier weapons systems than it did initially indicate that there&#8217;s less &#8212; at least in the assessment of the United States, less risk of retaliation from Russia now?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; The types of weapons systems we&#8217;re providing, Ed, are really a reflection of the conversations happening with the Ukrainian leadership and military about what they need in this stage of the war.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And because this stage of the war is different &#8212; because it&#8217;s going to be more on the ground and more &#8212; more, kind of, back-and-forth, long-range fighting &#8212; there&#8217;s different kinds of weapons and system they need: more artillery, more ammunition.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a different &#8212; different war than it was when they were, you know, in the western part of the country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You had said earlier that you &#8212; that the government is continuing to monitor that whatever is sent over is meeting the needs of the war.&nbsp; How exactly is that monitoring happening?&nbsp; (Inaudible), there are going to be a lot of questions about how was the money spent, who did the equipment get in the hands of, how was it used.&nbsp; It may not be the next few weeks &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; but this could be over the next several months or years of “Was this worth it?&nbsp; Was it worth the cost?”</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How is that being done now?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, look, I think that if you ask most Americans, if you ask members of Congress, if you ask most people in this country, what we &#8212; what&#8217;s important to do now is to equip and provide the type of support, assistance, including military equipment, to help them continue to fight &#8212; and win, in some cases, as they did in the Battle of Kyiv &#8212; this war.</p>



<p>That is our focus.&nbsp; Obviously, we coordinate very closely with them, but we provide them the assistance to distribute amongst their military.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because there was support in the beginning of the Iraq War, in the Afghanistan War, and then there were years spent trying to retrace the spending and all that.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not saying that necessarily is going to be the case in this one, but there&#8217;s &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; And &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; no mechanism in place right now at least to track &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I would point you to the Department of Defense to detail that further.&nbsp; But I would note: Obviously, this is different, given we don&#8217;t have U.S. soldiers on the ground.</p>



<p>Obviously, equipment, ensuring we&#8217;re reducing waste, fraud, and abuse is important to the President, but it&#8217;s a different kind of war for a range of reasons.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Given that Russia has conducted an ICBM test, is there any plan to reschedule the one that we cancelled back on April 1st?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; That&#8217;s not something we would preview.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; And what&#8217;s the latest on the reported chemical weapons attack in Mariupol?&nbsp; Did the Russians use chemical weapons?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; There&#8217;s no new assessment from here.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do we have any sense of when or how much longer that would take?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t.&nbsp; I mean, what we talked about at the time &#8212; and I know my colleagues at the Department of Defense and State also referenced &#8212; is we don&#8217;t have a team on the ground.&nbsp; It is difficult to assess.&nbsp; So, it is something certainly we continue to work to do, but we don&#8217;t have any additional updates or confirmation.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; I have a question about marijuana policy.&nbsp; President Biden, as a candidate, promised to decriminalize marijuana.&nbsp; When is that going to happen?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, the President continues to believe that no one should be in jail because of drug use.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have an update here.&nbsp; We are continuing to work with Congress.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But what I can say on marijuana is we&#8217;ve made some progress on our promises.&nbsp; For instance, the DEA just issued its first licenses to companies to cultivate marijuana for research purposes after years of delay during the prior administration. This is a key step in promoting research because it broadens the amount and quality of cannabis available for research purposes.</p>



<p>Additionally, the President is continuing to view his cleme- &#8212; review his clemency powers, which is something he also talked about on the campaign, and he certainly remains committed to taking action on.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So he remains committed to what he said during the campaign, that people charged with marijuana-related offenses &#8212; number one, everybody gets out, record expunged?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, again, he&#8217;s reviewing his clemency powers.&nbsp; That&#8217;s exactly what that looks like.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have any updates or previews beyond that, though.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; And a question about immigration.&nbsp; Does the President still have confidence that the Vice President can get to the bottom of root causes of migration?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; He absolutely does and is grateful for her work in doing exactly that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Why does he have confidence?&nbsp; Or &#8212; should I &#8212; should I give you an update on a couple of the things we&#8217;ve done?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well &#8212; so, does the President &#8212; what gives the President confidence when he sees that March 2022 has 28 percent more migrant encounters at the border than March 2021, when she got this assignment?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, you asked me about root causes &#8212; right? &#8212; so let me address that first and what the Vice President and other members of the administration who have been working with her have been doing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So we&#8217;ve been working with source and transit coun- &#8212; countries in the region to facilitate the quick return of individuals who previously resided in those countries, as well as to stem migration in its state.&nbsp; Some of that is getting agreements with partner countries on migration-related matters, and that&#8217;s something that the Vice President has been deeply engaged with.</p>



<p>I&#8217;d also note that Secretary Mayorkas &#8212; who, of course, has worked with her on this &#8212; traveled to Costa Rica recently, where he joined the President of Costa Rica in announcing a bilateral migration agreement outlining our shared commitment to both manage migrant flows, as well as to promote &#8212; promote economic growth in the region.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And we also are maintaining a close partnership between the government of Mexico and the United States to stem irregular migration.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, there are &#8212; what “addressing root causes” means is working with countries in the region to take steps to have partnership, be able to have people sent back to the region as needed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then the last one on this: Is the President or are you guys having discussions with advisors about delaying the removal of Title 42?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would again remind everyone &#8212; because you gave me the opportunity, so thank you &#8212; Title 42 is not an immigration authority.&nbsp; I will &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it going to be &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; &#8212; I will get to your &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; around past the end of May?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I will &#8212; I will get to your question.&nbsp; I promise, Peter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is a public health authority.&nbsp; Congress gave the CDC authority to make determinations about when it should be lifted.&nbsp; So, right now, we are planning and preparing for the end of Title 42 enforcement on May 23rd.&nbsp; But I would say that there are a range &#8212; the President agrees that immigration in our country is broken; it&#8217;s a system that is broken.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are a range of ideas out there in Congress &#8212; Democrats, Republicans, others &#8212; some who support a delay of Title 42 implementation, some who strongly oppose it.&nbsp; And there are a range of other ideas of reforming our immigration system.</p>



<p>This would all require congressional action.&nbsp; We&#8217;re happy to have that conversation with them.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Along the Title 42 &#8212; excuse me, sorry, it&#8217;s allergies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; It&#8217;s okay.&nbsp; We understand.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#8217;m good.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We understand.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We&#8217;ve been reporting that the administration is projecting a big budget shortfall for ICE and CBP should Title 42 be lifted.&nbsp; Is there a plan for how to get additional funding that&#8217;s going to be needed to handle immigrants coming into the country?&nbsp; If that &#8212; Title 42 is lifted, will you need funds from Congress?&nbsp; Can you divert funds from somewhere else?&nbsp; What&#8217;s the thinking?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; So what DHS said last month is that they expect the current funding levels will not be sufficient to meet operational needs, but they have a number of options available to secure the resources required to implement our comprehensive strategy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This includes reprioritizing and reallocating existing funds; re- &#8212; requesting additional support from other federal agencies; if necessary, engaging with Congress on that discussion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I would note that, as a part of this &#8212; you know, as we prepare for the implementation as &#8212; of the end of Title 42, there are a range of steps that we&#8217;ve been taking to prepare for that, including surging resources; deploying resour- &#8212; resources to address increased volumes.&nbsp; That includes moving officers, agents, DHS volunteer force personnel to rapidly decompress points along the border and more efficiently process migrants.</p>



<p>It also entails the deployment of COVID-19 mitigation efforts, including the use of continued &#8212; use of PPE, providing the COVID-19 vaccines.&nbsp; It also includes expanding these efforts to cover migrants in CBP custody.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, the point is there are a range of steps in this comprehensive plan that &#8212; I know Secretary Mayorkas is testifying today on the Hill, and I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;ll be testifying more in the future.&nbsp; But what they said at the time when we announced this was that we expect current funding levels would not be sufficient.&nbsp; There are a range of ways to address that, and we&#8217;re working on exactly that.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And if &#8212; because we&#8217;re just about a month away from this being lifted &#8212; if the administration doesn&#8217;t feel like that plan is in place yet, would that be a reason to delay lifting Title 42?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, we proposed a plan.&nbsp; So that&#8217;s a plan that is being implemented.&nbsp; In terms of any ideas to address immigration, including any delay of Title 42, that would require congressional action.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So &#8212; go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More than 3,000 Ukrainians were processed along the southern border &#8212; people who had flown to Mexico to try to get into the U.S.&nbsp; That&#8217;s a big leap over February.&nbsp; That number is expected to increase.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Does the administration have any plans to announce a program that would make it easier for Ukrainians who already have family ties in the U.S. to be expedited into the U.S.?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We are &#8212; we are working &#8212; so, we&#8217;ve obviously announced &#8212; the President has announced plans to accept 100,000 Ukrainians into the United States &#8212; if they want to come, of course.&nbsp; We are working to finalize the details of that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course, right now, we are still &#8212; as you all know; as we&#8217;ve been talking about &#8212; implementing Title 42, no matter what country you&#8217;re coming from, whether it&#8217;s Ukraine or any other country in the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; But nothing &#8212; is there anything immediately in the works for a plan &#8212; a program similar to that to (inaudible).</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, no, the President announced, a few weeks ago, plans to welcome 100,000 Ukrainian &#8212; Ukrainians, right?&nbsp; So it&#8217;s just the details of how that program will work.&nbsp; I understand why you&#8217;re asking; we just don&#8217;t have the final details yet.&nbsp; But &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; And then, on supply chains, millions of people in China are on lockdown.&nbsp; Experts are sounding the alarm for what that could mean for further crippling supply chains, which already are &#8212; obviously are already under strain.&nbsp; Is the administration concerned?&nbsp; How concerned is the administration about what that could mean for Americans waiting for goods here in the U.S.?&nbsp; Is there anything that the U.S. can do to mitigate that?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; So this is a very fluid &#8212; and I think you&#8217;re talking about the lockdown around Shanghai &#8212; right? &#8212; and the impact.&nbsp; So it&#8217;s a very fluid situation, obviously.&nbsp; There&#8217;s some uncertainty surrounding the impacts of China&#8217;s lockdown on our economy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We are in close contact with key actors in the supply chain, including the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach.&nbsp; We&#8217;re not seeing currently, according to the Port of LA, any slowdown in ships coming from Asia, but we&#8217;re going to continue to keep our eye on that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What we&#8217;ve seen happen within China is moving of the manufacturing of some of the goods &#8212; semiconductors, consumer electronics, et cetera &#8212; that are coming &#8212; typically come from Shanghai to other hubs, moving them around to see if they can keep the manufacturing up.&nbsp; And they&#8217;ve also moved ports and where &#8212; moved around where the &#8212; where the goods are going from in ports there, which may be why we haven&#8217;t seen a reduction in goods coming from Asia.</p>



<p>The last data, in terms of Chinese exports, we have is from March, because it&#8217;s not yet the end of April, and that showed a 15 percent increase from last year.&nbsp; But we&#8217;ll have to look at the April data when it comes out in May.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I might be being a little thick, but I still don&#8217;t quite understand what the administration&#8217;s position on the &#8212; how you’re, kind of, approaching the mask issue is.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, the Justice Department said that they would appeal the decision if the CDC wanted them to.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The CDC has said that they wanted masks, they still think masking is important, and that they had that policy in place.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, I don&#8217;t understand why the Justice Department is not immediately appealing it and especially seeking an emergency stay to potentially keep this in place while the CDC continues its sort of broader evaluation.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; Well, I&#8217;m &#8212; I don&#8217;t even play a lawyer on TV, so I won&#8217;t get too much into legal strategy.&nbsp; But what I will tell you is the CDC obviously, as you noted, called for this extension because they wanted to look at more data.&nbsp; So I think we can all expect they&#8217;re going to continue to want it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Department of Justice is just waiting for that kind of final comment to &#8212; to take action in appealing. &nbsp;They said they would appeal.&nbsp; In terms of when they will appeal, I&#8217;ll leave that to them to speak to.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Why not a stay or an emergency appeal?&nbsp; They can speak to that.&nbsp; But what I would note &#8212; the objective here is, of course, to appeal the 15-day extension but also to preserve the CDC authority over the long term.&nbsp; Because as we&#8217;ve noted from here, we expect there to be ups and downs in the pandemic, and we certainly want the CDC to continue to have this authority.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So &#8212; in, I guess, plain English: If the CDC determines at the end of that 15-day review period that they already had undergoing that they wouldn&#8217;t continue the mask mandate, then the Justice Department will not pursue this appeal?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I would expect you&#8217;ll hear from the CDC very soon.&nbsp; And I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s at the end of 15 days, in terms of their expectation and ask for an appeal.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Title 42, you kind of floated congressional action out there and (inaudible) because Title 42, I think, was like a key part of the &#8212; in scuttling the negotiations over COVID money.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so what I&#8217;m trying to, I think &#8212; the question I&#8217;m curious in is if you&#8217;re signaling that sort of willingness by the administration to negotiate over the lifting of Title 42 as part of trying to get that COVID package across line.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And &#8212; and if not, or if so, do you have any sort of update on the strategy there?&nbsp; Because you &#8212; you were certainly banging the drums about how important it was before Congress went away, and they&#8217;re coming back soon.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We&#8217;re still banging the drums about the COVID money, I promise you.&nbsp; I was just making clear, because I think there&#8217;s been some confusion about this, that while the CDC had the &#8212; has the authority &#8212; right? &#8212; to determine when the &#8212; the &#8212; when &#8212; when the conditions exist to lift Title 42, that was given to them by Congress.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If Congress were to want to extend that, they need to take action.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not a &#8212; it&#8217;s not an executive authority from the White House.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, the President would be open to legislation that provided COVID funding but also extended &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We&#8217;re not in any way there, so I wasn&#8217;t going there.&nbsp; I was just conveying that, as you know, there are strong views on a range of immigration issues and proposals in Congress, right?&nbsp; I&#8217;m not telling you something you don&#8217;t know.</p>



<p>There are some people who would like to see it extended; there are some people who definitely would not.&nbsp; And so, I&#8217;m not making a prediction of the future, only conveying to what authority would be required &#8212; what &#8212; what the process would require.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Would the White House support the bill that Senator Sinema is &#8212; is bringing forth, which is working to extend Title 42 until there&#8217;s a plan in place &#8212; to, sort of, end the public health emergency?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have any prediction of that.&nbsp; The President has proposed, put forward, called for immigration reform &#8212; something he did on his first day in office.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re happy to have a range of conversations with members about a range of ideas.&nbsp; But I just wanted to note what authority would be required or what &#8212; how the process would work.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two things.&nbsp; South Korean media is reporting that President Biden will visit the country next month, May 20th through the 22nd.&nbsp; Can you confirm that?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don’t have anything to confirm yet on the trip beyond what the President himself has already confirmed.&nbsp; But we will have more to say soon, I&#8217;m sure.&nbsp; (Laughter.)</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All right.&nbsp; And on COVID aid, I&#8217;m wondering if the administration has sort of a drop-dead date by which Congress has to give them the additional funding?&nbsp; I know you&#8217;ve talked about it.&nbsp; The supply of monoclonal antibodies will run out in May &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; and the test capacity will ramp down by the end of June.&nbsp; So, is June your deadline or is it much earlier?&nbsp; Or is it later if you can repurpose some of the existing money?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I would say it&#8217;s as soon as possible because we have already had to take steps &#8212; right? &#8212; like ending our program for the uninsured.&nbsp; We haven&#8217;t been able to make purchases that we would normally purchase to get ahead.</p>



<p>I mean, even on monoclonal antibodies or some of these treatments, some of them take months to make, so it already puts us behind where we need to be and want to be in planning.&nbsp; So, we don&#8217;t have a long-term deadline, nor would I punt that out.&nbsp; We want to do it as quickly as possible when they return.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; Several senators, Democrats and Republican, have called on the President to appoint a coordinator or a czar, if you will, to oversee the transfer of military equipment from the U.S. to Ukraine.&nbsp; What does the administration think of this idea?&nbsp; Do you think it’s needed and is it something that’s even being considered?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have any personnel updates.&nbsp; Obviously, ensuring that it is &#8212; and this kind of goes back to Ed&#8217;s earlier question &#8212; that it is done effectively, efficiently, quickly is &#8212; is our &#8212; is a priority for the President.&nbsp; But I don&#8217;t have any &#8212; any personnel previews or updates at this point in time.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, two questions.&nbsp; I wanted to ask you about the concept of athletic boycotts to deal with Russia and if this is something that the administration supports.&nbsp; I’m sure you saw some of the news that Wimbledon decided to ban athletes from Russia and Belarus from competing in the tournament, and I’m just curious if the administration believes the athletic boycotts are a good tactic to use.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, we’ve seen 600, if not more, companies &#8211;private-sector companies &#8212; pull out voluntarily, I think, their investments in Russia.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t &#8212; I don&#8217;t think we have a policy specifically on athletic events at this point in time.&nbsp; I&#8217;m happy to check.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, also, there were reports that Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and some other U.S. officials walked out of G20 rooms when Russian officials began speaking.&nbsp; Could you just explain a little bit more about why they took that move?&nbsp; And is it a move that we could anticipate President Biden making himself?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, the President and Secretary Yellen have both said that we can&#8217;t have business as usual at the G20 or in a lot of these international forums as it relates to Russia.</p>



<p>And she and the Treasury team made clear that she was planning to participate in some and not other meetings, which is certainly something we support.</p>



<p>The President also has conveyed he doesn’t believe that they should be a part &#8212; that Russia should be a part of the G20.&nbsp; That&#8217;s now six months away, in terms of his participation, so I can’t make a prediction of what actions he may or may not take.&nbsp; But certainly, we support her steps, and it&#8217;s an indication of the fact that President Putin and Russia has become a pariah on the global stage.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.&nbsp; Just today, Russia issued another warning about consequences of Finland and Sweden joining NATO. Do have a response?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, the decision of any country to join NATO is up to that country and NATO to make a determination about.&nbsp; And certainly, that&#8217;s the case here.&nbsp; We strongly support NATO&#8217;s open-door policy, and I&#8217;m not going to indulge Russia&#8217;s saber-rattling.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.&nbsp; Just to zoom out a little on the Ukraine &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; aid and the policy talks about this war.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The president of the European Council, Charles Michel, was there today in Kyiv.&nbsp; And he said, quote &#8212; it was unusually clear, I thought.&nbsp; He said, “You are not alone.&nbsp; We are with you and will do everything which is possible to support you and to make sure that Ukraine will win the war.”&nbsp; Is it the policy of the United States that Russia should not only lose but be seen to lose this war?&nbsp; Is that a strategic goal?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I think we&#8217;ve been pretty clear that we&#8217;re going to do everything possible to make sure President Putin and Russia recognize this is a strategic loss, that the President is a pariah on the global stage.</p>



<p>Now, when you have a country that has lost as many people as Ukraine has &#8212; millions of people have been left homeless &#8212; you know, I don&#8217;t know if that feels like a win to them.</p>



<p>But I think it&#8217;s also true that the Ukrainians have clearly won the Battle of Kyiv.&nbsp; They have surpassed the expectations of the world in terms of their ability to fight back against Russia.&nbsp; And Russia has not only become a pariah on the world stage, but they have effectively united NATO, effectively driven countries to desire an interest in joining NATO, have united the West in a way that has never been their objective, while also their economy is crumbling.</p>



<p>So, you know, that is all a victory in terms of &#8212; in terms of isolating Russia.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; But is the concrete goal of the aid that is going there &#8212; now it&#8217;s artillery and more &#8212; is the goal a battlefield defeat for Russia, ultimately?&nbsp; Not a compromise, not &#8212; not, you know &#8212; no gray areas, just &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We&#8217;re doing everything we can to equip the Ukrainian government, Ukrainian leaders to effectively fight back in this military battle.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; Just to go back to the mask ruling.&nbsp; You mentioned some of the videos that we saw, but it certainly did prompt some very abrupt changes on Monday after it came down &#8212; passengers being told mid-flight to take their masks off.&nbsp; Can you share more about what the President&#8217;s personal reaction was to the decision, to how it came down, and what unfolded over this couple of hours and the stories we&#8217;re hearing about some of those flights?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I&#8217;m not sure we have a story here about some of those flights.&nbsp; I &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No, no &#8212; the story that &#8212; I mean, you know, we&#8217;re hearing now about parents talking about being on a flight with their kids and them being concerned because they were mid-flight.&nbsp; But just &#8212; what was his reaction to the decision and what happened then over the next couple of hours on Monday?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, we obviously didn&#8217;t expect the decision because we wouldn&#8217;t have known in advance how a court would act.&nbsp; So &#8212; and we disagreed with the decision immediately.&nbsp; So the immediate steps were to determine what power we had to respond to that.&nbsp; Obviously, that &#8212; that came in the form of the Department of Justice, came in the form of the CDC acting and putting out the statements that they did.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But, you know, we also don&#8217;t take photos of flights as data about how the country reacts to issues &#8212; you know, whether they&#8217;re ripping off their masks or not.&nbsp; I mean, our focus here was seeing what power we had to preserve what we felt was in the public health interests of the country.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And are the President&#8217;s COVID advisors concerned that there could be an increase in cases, a spike in cases in the coming weeks because, specifically, of the mask mandate being lifted?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I&#8217;m not going to make a projection of that because I&#8217;m not a doctor.&nbsp; And certainly, I can check with our health team and see if they have any predictions of that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Obviously, they wanted more time because they&#8217;ve seen rising cases and they feel it is in our interest to preserve the mask mandate, even for that short period of time &#8212; or have the authority moving forward in case cases go up and we needed to take that step in the future.</p>



<p>But I don&#8217;t have a prediction of rising cases.&nbsp; I would point you to the CDC or other health officials.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, there are reports in Mexico media stating the Mexican government has decided to dismantle a binational police group that was fighting Mexican cartels and drug cartel operations down there.&nbsp; I wonder if the administration is aware of that, and if you have any reaction to that decision.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I&#8217;m happy to check with our NSC team and see if they have any specific reaction.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Go ahead.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; First of all, on Israel, does the administration have a reaction to the recent deadly clashes in Israel with Palestinians?&nbsp; Does it change your stance on the Abraham Accord?&nbsp; Do you have a different view now on how to achieve peace in that region?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We are &#8212; while we are deeply concerned by the recent violence in Jerusalem at the Temple Mount &#8212; on the Temple Mount and across the West Bank, we also strongly condemn the recent rocket attack on Israel.&nbsp; We continue to call on all sides to exercise restraint, avoid provocative actions and rhetoric, and preserve the historic status quo of the Haram al-Sharif Temple Mount.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We also continue to urge Israeli and Palestinian officials to work cooperatively to lower tensions and ensure the safety of everyone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And we, of course, continue to closely follow the situation on the ground and stay in touch through diplomatic channels.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any change in stance on the Abraham Accord?&nbsp; Or &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; There is no change in our &#8212; on our stance.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Cuba &#8212; as you know, administration officials are meeting with Cuba to &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; discuss maybe including them in a migration policy.&nbsp; What might that look like in the future?&nbsp; And is that a possibility?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would say that we see these talks as pretty standard.&nbsp; The migration talks provide an opportunity for discussions on migration issues between Cubi [sic] and the &#8212; Cuba and the United States.&nbsp; And they&#8217;re part of regular order meetings continuing over nearly 30 years of engagement on Cuba on &#8212; with Cuba on migration matters.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We maintain &#8212; we maintain these in order to discuss safe, orderly, and legal migration.&nbsp; That remains a primary U.S. &#8212; a primary U.S. interest.&nbsp; So, beyond what they will look like &#8212; I mean, to us, they &#8212; this is just a standard operating process and discussions that have been happening over the course of many years.&nbsp; The last ones were, of course, in 2018.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, finally, just on some of the munitions being sent to Ukraine: How does the administration justify sending Claymore munitions, which critics say are quite dangerous and, in their antipersonnel-mine form, have been banned by 160 countries, including Ukraine?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I&#8217;d point you to the Department of Defense to speak to any specifics of the military equipment or assistance we&#8217;re providing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Obviously, we&#8217;re providing this to a country that is facing an invasion by Russia that is targeting their civilians and their people.&nbsp; And this is meant to effectively help them fight that war.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thanks, everyone.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>Since the launch of the Collaborative Migration Management Strategy, the U.S. Government has made progress with its partners on each line of action, setting the strong foundation of collaborative migration management upon which to further build.&nbsp; The February 2, 2021 Executive Order, <em>Creating a Comprehensive Regional Framework to Address the Causes of Migration, to Manage Migration Throughout North and Central America, and to Provide Safe and Orderly Processing of Asylum Seekers at the United States Border</em>, called for a strategy to collaboratively manage migration.&nbsp; The Collaborative Migration Management Strategy, launched on July 29, 2021, identifies and prioritizes actions to strengthen cooperative efforts to manage safe, orderly, and humane migration in North and Central America.&nbsp; Specifically, the Collaborative Migration Management Strategy aims to address urgent humanitarian needs, promote access to protection and legal pathways for migration, improve secure and humane border management, and provide support for returnees to successfully reintegrate into their communities.&nbsp; Addressing these objectives requires sustained cooperation with a broad range of stakeholders, including Congress, civil society, international organizations, the private sector, labor unions, and governments inside and outside the region.<br><br><strong>Stabilize Populations with Acute Needs</strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>Surge U.S. Humanitarian Assistance:</strong>&nbsp; In light of dire conditions and acute suffering faced by millions of people in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, Vice President Harris announced in April 2021 an additional $310 million in U.S. Government support for humanitarian relief and to address food insecurity&nbsp;from&nbsp;the&nbsp;Department of&nbsp;State, USAID, DOD and USDA. &nbsp;This announcement brought the total amount of&nbsp;humanitarian assistance provided by State and USAID to&nbsp;more than $272 million&nbsp;for the responses in Central America and Mexico.&nbsp;&nbsp;DOD additionally allocated or re-aligned a total of $26 million to address the humanitarian drivers of migration, with a focus on El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras projects. &nbsp;USDA increased its original $55 million commitment to support food security by extending two of its existing programs in Guatemala and Honduras by an additional $20 million, bringing the total value to $75 million.<br></li><li><strong>UN Humanitarian Response Plans:&nbsp; </strong>The United Nations (UN) launched the 2021–2022 Humanitarian Response Plans for El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras in response to high-level engagement and direct appeals by the United States, with the UN appealing for $588 million to target 4.3 million people in need of urgent humanitarian assistance.&nbsp; The United States has provided nearly $169 million toward the efforts laid out in the UN Humanitarian Response Plans for El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras.</li></ul>

<ul><li><strong>Build and Improve National Asylum Systems:&nbsp; </strong>In Guatemala, the State Department funded the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to continue supporting the Government of Guatemala to build its asylum capacity in line with its national action plan commitments under the Comprehensive Regional Protection and Solutions Framework (MIRPS). &nbsp;Guatemala received more than 1,000 asylum claims in 2021, which is over double the number received in any prior year.&nbsp; In Mexico, the Commission for Refugee Assistance (COMAR) accepted more than 131,000 applications for asylum in 2021, becoming the third highest receiver of claims in the world.&nbsp; With State Department support through UNHCR, COMAR granted asylum to 37,806 individuals in 2021.<br></li><li><strong>Establish Migration Resource Centers (MRCs)</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;With State Department funding, the International Organization for Migration (IOM), UNHCR, and the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) collaborated with the Government of Guatemala to establish three MRCs (referred to locally as Centros de Atención a Personas Migrantes y Refugiadas, or CAPMIRs) in Guatemala City, Tecun Uman, and Quetzaltenango.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, seven mobile units operate as part of the MRC network, covering six departments of Guatemala.&nbsp;&nbsp;The MRCs are located to benefit communities at risk of displacement, with high levels of emigration, and also along transit routes.&nbsp;&nbsp;They are designed to evaluate individuals’ protection, humanitarian, and economic needs in order to provide appropriate services and referrals, and have reached more than 32,000 individuals.<br></li><li><strong>Child Protection:&nbsp; </strong>In Guatemala, the State Department funded UNICEF to support the Guatemalan Migration Institute to establish a new Child Protection Unit (UAPNA), which deployed Child Protection Officers to the southern and northern borders of Guatemala.&nbsp; At the municipal level, State Department funding for UNICEF supported the establishment of Child Protection Offices in 40 percent of the 340 Guatemalan municipalities.&nbsp; In addition, State Department funding for UNHCR supported five departments in Guatemala implementing protocols for foster homes as an alternative care model for unaccompanied children.&nbsp; In Mexico, State Department funding to UNICEF and UNHCR helped child welfare authorities in Tijuana and Ciudad Juarez to eliminate long-standing backlogs of hundreds of best interest determinations for migrant children, which are required by Mexican law for all children encountered by the national migration authority.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Expand Access to Protection in Countries of Origin</strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>Humanitarian and Development Assistance for Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs):&nbsp; </strong>In El Salvador, the State Department supported the UNHCR launch of the Creating Opportunities program to offer technical and professional courses to improve livelihoods of young IDPs and others at risk of violence or exploitation by gangs, including forced recruitment.&nbsp; In Honduras, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) funded psychosocial support, gender-based violence prevention activities, migration awareness, and children’s rights protection information to approximately 5,100 Honduran youth and to over 1,375 returned migrants and IDPs impacted by the 2020 hurricanes.<br></li><li><strong>Detection and Services for Trafficking Victims:&nbsp; </strong>USAID funding in El Salvador supported work at the border to detect and refer victims of trafficking for appropriate services.&nbsp; In Guatemala, the State Department funded the Pan American Development Foundation in partnership with local organizations to improve the detection of human trafficking cases and provide services to over 250 victims, including medical care, mental health support, legal assistance, education, and reintegration services.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Expand Third Country Labor Migration Programs While Improving Worker Protections</strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>Institutional Capacity Building:&nbsp; </strong>USAID supported the Guatemalan Ministry of Labor, the Honduran Ministry of Labor, and the Salvadoran Ministry of Foreign Affairs through the design and implementation of new processes to increase access to seasonal work opportunities abroad, resulting in a record number of H-2B visas issued to nationals of these countries in FY 2021 with further growth expected in FY 2022.&nbsp; In Costa Rica, State Department funding for IOM supported the processing of 18,000 migrant requests in the agricultural temporary labor migration category.&nbsp; In addition, State Department funding for IOM supported a bilateral dialogue forum between the Governments of Belize and El Salvador on opportunities to improve labor migration regularization procedures between both countries.<br></li><li><strong>Expand Support for Migrant Worker Protections:&nbsp; </strong>In El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, USAID funded pre-departure training for seasonal workers on their rights under the H-2 visa program.&nbsp; In El Salvador, State Department funding for IOM supported the participation of officials from the Ministries of Labor and External Affairs in a specialized course on best practices in labor migration management.&nbsp; The Salvadoran Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare also hosted an event to share best practices on ethical recruitment, involving participants from El Salvador, Honduras, and Panama.&nbsp;<br></li><li><strong>Strengthen Worker Outreach and Compliance Assistance:&nbsp; </strong>The U.S. Department of Labor, through its Wage and Hour Division (WHD) redoubled its efforts to conduct outreach to stakeholders regarding the requirements of the H-2A and H-2B programs, as well as the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act. &nbsp;Since August 2021, WHD has conducted 597 outreach events through its district and regional offices.&nbsp; WHD also provided compliance assistance and education to multiple national agricultural employer stakeholders and participated in a cross-departmental presentation hosted by DHS to over 300 stakeholders in addition to interagency meetings with Northern Central America government agencies to explain H-2A program requirements.&nbsp; Finally, WHD published a one-page summary sheet on key H-2A worker protections and shared this information, along with other outreach materials, such as worker rights cards and information on how to file a complaint, with consular staff and USAID contractors for distribution to workers.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Assist and Reintegrate Returned Persons</strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>Expand Reception and Reintegration Services:&nbsp; </strong>Over the last two years, almost 120,000 (22,308 women, 75,271 men, 7,866 girls and 13,740 boys) returned migrants have gone through the USAID-supported reception processes in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. USAID provided almost 9,000 returned or prospective migrants with psycho-social assistance, job skill development and vocational training, job orientation and placement, and reinsertion to school in the three countries.&nbsp; The USAID-supported Reception Center for Returned Migrants in Guatemala City established a permanent presence of officials to issue national identification cards to returnees free of charge, an official clinic and COVID-19 vaccination center for returnees, and the permanent presence of the Ministry of Labor, including initial pilot programs to link returnees with job opportunities.<br></li><li><strong>Support Assisted Voluntary Return (AVR):</strong>&nbsp; From August through December 2021, the State Department funded IOM to administer AVR supporting 1,250 vulnerable migrants in Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, Honduras, and El Salvador.&nbsp; The State Department is funding an IOM regional program to expand AVR to additional countries and nationalities in the Western Hemisphere.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Foster Secure and Humane Management of Borders</strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>Institutional Capacity Building:&nbsp; </strong>In order to manage irregular migration and the growing number of unaccompanied children transiting through and departing from Guatemala, from July through December 2021, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) trained over 600 Government of Guatemala personnel.&nbsp; In addition, DHS mentors in Monterrey, Guadalajara, and Tijuana in Mexico worked alongside Government of Mexico officials to counter human smuggling and fraud.&nbsp; DHS mentoring efforts in Honduras resulted in the arrest of 110 human smugglers in 2021 and the transfer of over 190 unaccompanied migrant children to Honduras’s children and family directorate.&nbsp; These capacity building efforts represent a U.S. Government multi-agency effort to enhance security throughout the law enforcement process, from investigation to arrest to successful prosecution.<br></li><li><strong>Enhance Migrant-Smuggling and Human-Trafficking Investigations and Prosecutions: </strong>DHS information exchange with Mexican and Central American counterparts resulted in multiple leads for Operation Sentinel, an interagency counter-network operation targeting transnational criminal organizations affiliated with the smuggling of migrants.&nbsp; In addition, under Joint Task Force Alpha, the Department of Justice with DHS investigated and prosecuted human smuggling and trafficking groups operating in Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras.&nbsp; In Guatemala, efforts focus on the indictments and extraditions of Guatemalan human smugglers to the United States to face prosecution.&nbsp; In Honduras, DHS is supporting Operation Scorpion, a border surge initiative of the Honduran National Police, targeting human smugglers and traffickers.<br></li><li><strong>Increase Information Sharing with and among Regional Partners:</strong>&nbsp; State Department foreign assistance funding supported a regional effort to share criminal intelligence about transnational criminal organizations and associated criminals in Central America, with a focus on migrant smuggling and human trafficking.&nbsp; During 2021, this effort facilitated the identification of suspected members and networks of transnational criminal organizations.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Strengthen Regional Public Messaging on Migration</strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>Promote Accurate Information Countering Human Smugglers</strong>: The State Department provided factual information about U.S. immigration policies, including digital content specifically for Haitian migrants reaching more than 1.5 million individuals between August and December 2021. &nbsp;The State Department supported IOM to expand its Migration Information Portal and register over 4,500 new portal users from July to December 2021 to provide information on legal migration pathways in the region.&nbsp; USAID also launched migration messaging campaigns in the region: in El Salvador, the “<em>De Aquí Soy</em>” campaign launched in September 2021 and reached almost two million people in three months; in Honduras, the two-part documentary “In the Claws of the Coyote” reached approximately 800,000 viewers; and in Guatemala, the “<em>Quédate Aquí</em>” video series was seen by more than 1.6 million viewers on local TV.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Expand Access to Lawful Pathways for Protection and Opportunity in the United States</strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>Restart and Expand Central American Minors (CAM) Program and other U.S. Refugee Admissions Program Processing: </strong>In September 2021, the State Department and DHS expanded the eligibility categories for U.S.-based relatives who can apply for their children in Northern Central America to access the CAM program.&nbsp; State is working to streamline the CAM application and has put out a Notice for Funding Opportunities for organizations to have dedicated funding to work on CAM applications.&nbsp; Since its restart, cases for nearly 1,700 children have been either reopened or submitted.&nbsp; As of April 13, there have been 1,023 beneficiaries from CAM and other U.S. refugee admissions programs in Central America who arrived in the United States in FY 2022.<br></li><li><strong>Increase Access to Temporary Work Visas While Ensuring Worker Protections:&nbsp; </strong>DHS and DOL will issue two temporary final rules this fiscal year, providing for supplemental visa allocations of 18,000 H-2B visas reserved for nationals of Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, or Haiti (6,500 allotted for the first half of FY 2022 and 11,500 for the second half of FY 2022).&nbsp; These follow an H-2B supplemental allocation that DHS and DOL issued in May 2021, reserving an allocation for the first time for Northern Central American nationals.&nbsp; The United States has also undertaken efforts to significantly increase the number of Northern Central American agricultural workers who receive an H-2A visa, and has conducted outreach with stakeholders and provided information on program requirements and worker protections.&nbsp; <em>Cierto Global</em>, a non-profit ethical recruiter, has received private funding to establish operations in Guatemala in order to ethically recruit, train, and place H-2A agricultural workers on farms in the United States.&nbsp; USAID facilitated contacts between <em>Cierto Global</em> and the Government of Guatemala to help <em>Cierto</em> quickly establish operations in Guatemala.<br></li><li><strong>High-Level Donor Roundtable for Humanitarian Response Plans:</strong>&nbsp; In order to internationalize the response to the UN Humanitarian Response Plans and broaden the funding base, the United States, Canada, and European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations, in partnership with the UN, co-hosted a high-level virtual donor roundtable meeting in November 2021.<br></li><li><strong>Migration Ministerial Meeting:&nbsp; </strong>In October 2021, the United States and Colombia co-hosted a Ministerial Meeting in Bogotá on the Causes and Challenges of Irregular Migration, resulting in a Joint Declaration signed by 17 countries from our region, reiterating the United States’ commitment to working collaboratively to address the migration challenges throughout the region.&nbsp; In April 2022, the United States and Panama co-hosted a further Ministerial Meeting in Panama City to redouble collaborative efforts on the regional response to migration and displacement.&nbsp;</li></ul>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Economic Club of New York</em></p>



<p><em>As Prepared for Delivery</em></p>



<ol type="I"><li><strong>Introduction</strong></li></ol>



<p>Good afternoon, everyone.&nbsp; Thanks to Barbara Van Allen and the entire team at the Economic Club of New York for hosting me today.&nbsp; It’s great to be here.</p>



<p>In the early days of the Republic, Alexander Hamilton prepared a series of reports to Congress that laid the intellectual foundations for the young American economy.&nbsp; The first report was about securing the public credit.&nbsp; The second was about establishing a national bank.&nbsp; And the third—his 1791 <em>Report on the Subject of Manufactures</em>—offered a vision for a strong industrial system in America.</p>



<p>In the United States, he argued, “the public purse must supply the deficiency of private resource.&nbsp; In what can it be so useful as in prompting and improving the efforts of industry?”</p>



<p>That imperative has a contested history in American economic policy. &nbsp;For much of the last half-century, even uttering the words “industrial policy” was met with something between derision and concern.&nbsp; But our economy has changed, and the world has changed, too.</p>



<p>My core point today is this: it is a critical and urgent imperative for the United States to chart and implement a <em><u>modern American industrial strategy</u></em>.</p>



<p>Properly conceived and implemented, an industrial strategy <em>is</em> an economic resilience and capacity strategy.&nbsp; Investments in our industrial capacity will leave our economy better positioned to weather future shocks—and to help all Americans thrive.</p>



<p>Ten months ago, I proposed the idea of a modern American industrial strategy to describe what animated President Biden’s approach to strengthening the economy.&nbsp; The turbulent, historic economic events of the last year have underscored the case. &nbsp;The question should move from “<em>why</em> should we pursue an industrial strategy?” to “<em>how </em>do we pursue one successfully?”</p>



<p>When the pandemic began, our economy suffered its sharpest contraction since the end of the Second World War.&nbsp; Job losses were the worst since the Great Depression—with communities of color and young people hit hardest.</p>



<p>President Biden came into office and set the nation on a new course, taking immediate action to fight the virus and deliver economic relief. &nbsp;History will judge the virtues of our crisis response—there’s room for debate.&nbsp; But there’s no question the President’s strategy helped generate the strongest recovery in modern history—with the fastest economic growth in nearly four decades; the strongest labor market recovery ever recorded; and record progress for Black and Hispanic Americans, the long-term unemployed, and others often left behind in a slow-growth economy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yes, our economy faces significant challenges.&nbsp; Our convulsive, pandemic-constrained recovery has produced high inflation globally and domestically.&nbsp; The pandemic exposed structural vulnerabilities—resulting from decades-long underinvestment in our industrial strength—that have continued to generate supply-chain bottlenecks across the economy.&nbsp; And now, Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine has compounded these challenges—exacerbating supply constraints, pushing up prices, and straining the post-Cold War world order.</p>



<p>Even so, the United States retains a stronger economic position than any other major country in the world, based on economic growth, job growth, consumer spending, and household balance sheets—even taking inflation into account.</p>



<p>What we have now is an opportunity, amid historic uncertainty.&nbsp; We should seize it—with an economic strategy that matches the moment.&nbsp;</p>



<ol type="I"><li><strong>Reviewing Our Progress</strong></li></ol>



<p>Today, I’d like to take stock of how far we’ve come and reassess the case for an American industrial strategy going forward. &nbsp;For the past year, we’ve centered on two core principles:</p>



<p><strong><em>First</em></strong>, strategic public investment must serve as the backbone to a strong industrial base.</p>



<p>The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is a case in point.&nbsp; Yes, it will make our supply chains more durable and reduce price pressures.&nbsp; Yes, it will connect more people to more places, create jobs, and push innovations from laboratory to market.</p>



<p>But it also represents the most significant effort in the last half-century to make a sustained, long-term public investment in America.&nbsp; This year, for the first time in two decades, America’s infrastructure investment will grow faster than China’s.</p>



<p>We need to build on this model.&nbsp; We’re within reach of passing the Bipartisan Innovation Act, which will help reclaim America’s leadership in semiconductors; authorize historic investments in basic R&amp;D; advance our leadership in technologies like artificial intelligence, 3D printing, telecommunications, and biotechnology; and spur innovation in places previously left behind.</p>



<p>The economic and national security threat of industrial weakness is accelerating.&nbsp; Congress urgently needs to send this legislation to the President’s desk so we can get to work rebuilding our industrial strength without delay.</p>



<p><strong>S</strong><strong><em>econd</em></strong>, we need to identify sectors where private industry, on its own, has not mobilized toward our core economic and national security interests—and lay the foundation for investment.</p>



<p>There’s a longstanding critique of industrial policy that it amounts to government picking “winners and losers.”&nbsp; There’s wisdom in this concern.&nbsp; Ill-conceived government interventions in private markets can produce inefficient and, worse, corrupting outcomes.&nbsp; But allowing this critique to reflexively hold back action misses the current global moment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To make critical goods, American companies need access to key inputs like raw materials.&nbsp; They need secure and reliable supply chains that the private market won’t deliver on its own—and potentially <em>cannot</em> deliver if geopolitical dynamics prevent them from accessing those inputs.&nbsp; These gaps can have major security implications.</p>



<p>Individual companies will rise and fall on their own merits.&nbsp; But it’s incumbent on us to support an ecosystem that enables American businesses to stand at the vanguard of solving these problems.</p>



<p>That’s what we have sought to do. &nbsp;Last June, we published a first-ever diagnosis and prescription for our most acute supply-chain vulnerabilities.&nbsp; Earlier this year, we released detailed resilience strategies across sectors like defense, public health, IT, and energy.</p>



<p>Consider critical minerals.&nbsp; Lithium, nickel, and cobalt are building blocks in everything from computers to appliances to electric vehicles and other clean-energy technologies—and demand is set to skyrocket.</p>



<p>Yet the United States depends heavily on foreign sources for many of these critical minerals.&nbsp; China, for instance, is estimated to control 85 percent of refining capacity for rare earths.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So far, private investment has fallen short of our national needs.&nbsp; But through strategic coordination, we can open channels for companies to invest.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s why President Biden invoked the Defense Production Act to support domestic production and address immediate security risks, consistent with our values.&nbsp; That’s why the Defense Department contracted with a Nevada-based company to establish the first end-to-end domestic supply chain for “permanent magnets”—with capacity to power 500,000 electric vehicles per year.&nbsp; And that’s why the Department of Energy is poised to invest nearly $7 billion to strengthen our end-to-end domestic battery supply chain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’re seeing companies respond.&nbsp; They’ve announced more than $200 billion in critical manufacturing investments in the United States.&nbsp; Manufacturing has seen its strongest job growth in three decades.</p>



<ol type="I"><li><strong>Re-underwriting the Case for Our Industrial Strategy</strong></li></ol>



<p>We can be proud of this progress.&nbsp; But the global economic landscape is evolving rapidly.</p>



<p>Russia’s unconscionable invasion of Ukraine is imposing a global supply shock on an already supply-constrained global economy. &nbsp;And COVID remains an acute risk to global supply chains, particularly in places like China.</p>



<p>Given this evolving landscape, how do we re-underwrite the case for a modern American industrial strategy?&nbsp; I would offer four reflections.</p>



<p><strong><em>First</em></strong>, we need to make our economy more resilient while working to lower price pressures across the economy today and over time.</p>



<p>Given the supply and inflationary pressures we’re facing, some may argue that investing for resilience and industrial strength tomorrow could push pricing higher today. &nbsp;This critique counsels caution, but misses an important point: ignoring resilience is ultimately more expensive.</p>



<p>The pandemic laid this bare.&nbsp; Our supply chains were put to test, and the allure of “just in time” turned into a cacophony of disruptions, long lead times, complexity, and massive costs.</p>



<p>Companies are confronting this reality.&nbsp; They’re recognizing that when disruptions happen, well-prepared companies can bounce back and even gain market share over competitors. &nbsp;Yet investments in resilience require time and resources up front, when the whole economy is supply-constrained.</p>



<p>We recognize this. &nbsp;It is why we’re aggressively working to make our global logistics supply chain more fluid and lower price pressures right now across the economy.&nbsp; These actions create space for longer-term investments in industrial resilience and capacity to take root.</p>



<p>We’ve worked to move our ports to 24/7 operations and reduce container dwell times, which are down 50 percent.&nbsp; We’ve also worked to recruit more truck drivers and improve the quality of trucking jobs; and trucking employment is up 35,000 over pre-pandemic levels.</p>



<p>Looking ahead, we need to bring our supply-chain logistics capabilities into the twenty-first century.&nbsp; We are now working to develop a reliable <em>digital</em> infrastructure to make our supply chains more agile.&nbsp; We should consider stress-testing private-sector supply chains to future shocks.&nbsp; The pandemic has underscored how major physical shocks can be both impulsive and inexorable, and we know climate change will only exacerbate them.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>Second</em></strong>, we need a modern American industrial strategy that expands and enhances international economic engagement.</p>



<p>I hope this point rings clear: You are not witnessing an American retreat from the global economy.&nbsp; Rather, you’re witnessing a new stage in how and why we engage—which will better serve the American middle class and American workers, while prioritizing our key global partners.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For America and the world, economic concerns are becoming more tightly linked to national security and national interests more broadly.&nbsp; In this environment, any thoughtful industrial strategy should prioritize partnerships with countries that respect fundamental norms and values—countries we can rely on—around transparency, open and fair rules-based trade, worker’s rights, and equity and opportunity.</p>



<p>This modern industrial strategy is centered on the reality that it’s neither feasible nor advisable to produce everything domestically.&nbsp; We need to <em>both</em> build resilience and capacity at home <em>and </em>forge more effective partnerships abroad. &nbsp;The Administration has sought to show that this clear-eyed approach to global economic ties can work—that we can assemble broad coalitions that amplify our own domestic strength.</p>



<p>This is what we’ve done in renewing our economic relationship with Europe, including the world’s first carbon-based sectoral deal on steel and aluminum trade. &nbsp;It’s also what we did—in bold and serious terms—when we led an historic global tax agreement with 136 countries to halt the race-to-the-bottom on corporate taxes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And it’s what we aim to do in the Indo-Pacific region, with an economic framework for sustained collaboration on everything from data flows to supply chains to clean energy.</p>



<p>We should consider the full scope of tools for cooperation—whether it’s strengthening a partnership with one trusted ally, reaching a broad multilateral agreement, or, as Secretary Yellen recently said, constructing a network of “plurilateral” trade arrangements.</p>



<p>We also need to reexamine existing barriers—whether that’s through additional “tariff exclusions” processes or other warranted steps, to make sure our trade policy serves American economic priorities.</p>



<p><strong><em>Third</em></strong>, a modern American industrial strategy needs to demonstrate that America can build—fast, as we’ve done before, and fairly, as we’ve sometimes failed to do.</p>



<p>Core to rebuilding our industrial base is exactly that: <em>building</em>.&nbsp; We need to unpack the many constraints that cause America to lag other major countries—including those with strong labor, environmental, and historical protections—in delivering infrastructure on budget and on time.</p>



<p>At the same time, past efforts to build fast often entailed discrimination and subjugation—running roughshod over already disadvantaged communities and places.&nbsp; Our generation must do better.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’ll need to confront complex, multilayered challenges that lack easy answers.&nbsp; For instance, building more affordable housing is vitally important, but it doesn’t happen instantly.&nbsp; It requires action by many stakeholders.&nbsp; It involves changing norms, incentives, and activities in highly localized ways.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The good news: the solutions don’t map onto traditional political, economic, or geographic divides.&nbsp; And the federal government can lead by example:</p>



<ul><li>We can establish coordinated federal decisions on permitting, instead of siloed agency actions, so projects can move forward with confidence, without sacrificing our values.</li></ul>



<ul><li>We can make the most of federal incentives, like conditioning transportation grants on land-use policies that help us build more efficiently and equitably.</li></ul>



<ul><li>We can pursue place-based policies—and build in geographies that may not only cost less but also have greater impact. The pandemic’s fundamental, structural disruption to how and where we work offers a unique moment to broaden the geographic aperture of economic opportunity in America.</li></ul>



<p>Most building will be carried out by state and local partners.&nbsp; The federal government will need to build capacity; demand progress over inertia; and learn from local innovation.</p>



<p>From the transcontinental railroad in the nineteenth century to the interstate highway system in the twentieth, Americans have shown their capacity to build great things.&nbsp; One powerful example stands a few blocks from here: the Empire State Building.&nbsp; It was constructed in just over a year.&nbsp; Nearly a century later, it remains an icon of American ambition and ingenuity.&nbsp; That’s the drive we’ll need to bring to our generation’s challenges.</p>



<p>One <strong><em>last</em></strong> reflection: these priorities are overlapping and reinforcing.&nbsp; There’s no clearer example than building resilience to energy shocks.</p>



<p>The global market for hydrocarbons is not a free market.&nbsp; It’s influenced by the geopolitical impulses of petrostates, some of which don’t share our interests or values.&nbsp; At the same time, the latest U.N. climate panel report confirms we have a narrow window to avoid the most devastating impacts of climate change.</p>



<p>In these two realities lies an opportunity: an industrial strategy for true energy security will reduce our reliance on volatile commodities and protect against the costs of the climate crisis.&nbsp; As the President said recently, “We need to choose long-term security over energy and climate vulnerability.”</p>



<p>By enacting long-term, technology-neutral incentives to generate zero-carbon energy and innovation, we can lay the foundation for more American-made clean-energy technologies and bolster domestic supply chains.&nbsp; We can partner with allies to expand our collective capacity to produce clean energy, while opening new export markets for American products.</p>



<p>And we can do it in a way that lowers immediate costs for Americans, keeps our affordable-energy advantage, and accelerates growth in energy communities transitioning toward industries of the future. &nbsp;Congress urgently needs to act here as well. &nbsp;</p>



<ol type="I"><li><strong>Conclusion</strong></li></ol>



<p>From Delta and Omicron, to supply-chain disruptions, and now to Russian aggression—our economy has shown striking resilience over the past year.&nbsp; But our most important work lies ahead.</p>



<p>What people will remember fifty years from now is whether we as a nation met this global moment.&nbsp; Did our economy emerge more resilient?&nbsp; Did it set the pace for generation-defining technologies?&nbsp; Did our alliances emerge more cooperative and unified in purpose?</p>



<p>In his <em>Report on Manufactures</em>, Hamilton argued that expanding American industry would be “favorable to national independence and safety.”&nbsp; America had just achieved independence, but building a strong industrial system would truly secure it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The American economy has been transformed many times over since then.&nbsp; Yet this economic and national security imperative endures.</p>



<p>Hamilton had one more insight we should heed today.&nbsp; “To increase the total mass of industry” in a country, he wrote, “is ultimately beneficial to every part of it.”&nbsp; We must ensure the gains are shared broadly by all Americans.</p>



<p>And we need the business community to step up and join us in this national renewal.  If we strike the right balance, the American economy—and our democracy—can emerge more vigorous, more prosperous, and more resilient to whatever challenges come our way.</p>

<p>President Biden is committed to ensuring federal resources and opportunities that can benefit rural America actually reach rural America. Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is launching the <strong>Rural Partners Network (RPN),</strong> a new whole-of-government effort led by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to transform the way federal agencies partner with rural places to create economic opportunity.</p>



<p>The Biden-Harris Administration is investing historic resources in rural communities so they can continue to compete and succeed in the 21<sup>st</sup> century. The President’s American Rescue Plan provided billions of dollars to rural workers, local governments, and small businesses to rebuild from the COVID-19 pandemic, and President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is a once-in-a-generation investment in affordable high-speed internet, clean drinking water, clean and reliable electricity, and better roads and bridges for rural communities across America. However, just making resources available is not enough—the federal government must better serve rural communities, so that they can take full advantage of these unprecedented opportunities.</p>



<p>To transform how the federal government partners with and delivers economic opportunity for rural communities across the United States, RPN will bring the federal government to rural America. New federal field staff will be placed in more than 25 rural communities in multiple U.S. states, Tribal Nations and territories to help local leaders navigate and access the federal resources they need to build a strong and vibrant economy. Through this unique partnership, RPN staff will also identify challenges preventing rural communities from accessing federal support to inform the work of the Rural Prosperity Interagency Policy Council, a whole-of-government task force that will ensure rural places are prioritized in Washington. RPN communities will have a new direct line to D.C. to foster a federal government that delivers for <em>all</em> rural communities.</p>



<p>To begin making the federal government work better for rural America, the Rural Partners Network is:</p>



<p><strong>Helping rural communities identify and leverage critical resources with the partnership of on-the-ground federal staff</strong>.</p>



<p>To boost local capacity, the Biden Administration will deploy new RPN staff to help communities access the full breadth of federal resources for community-led economic development, working in close coordination with: local leaders in government, business, and community organizations; federal agency field offices; existing federal efforts such as <a href="https://energycommunities.gov/">Interagency Working Group on Coal and Power Plant Communities and Economic Revitalization</a> and the President’s <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/01/27/fact-sheet-president-biden-takes-executive-actions-to-tackle-the-climate-crisis-at-home-and-abroad-create-jobs-and-restore-scientific-integrity-across-federal-government/">Justice40 Initiative</a>; and staff of the Regional Commissions. RPN Directors will be placed in states, territories and Tribal Nations to coordinate RPN activities, and RPN Liaisons will be placed in selected community networks to work with local leaders on an economic development vision and to secure the funds to make it a reality.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While these staff will be funded by USDA, they will have a whole-of-government mandate: help rural communities create economic opportunity by leveraging resources from all federal departments and agencies. To support this effort, 13 key agencies are dedicating a D.C.-based point person or team to serve as a front door for RPN staff and communities as they navigate the resources available across the federal government. These agencies participate in regular convenings of the Rural Prosperity Interagency Policy Council, co-led by the White House Domestic Policy Council and USDA.</p>



<p>Today, the Biden Administration is announcing the launch of this new program in selected community networks this year. In cohort 1, by the end of May, RPN staff will be on the ground supporting selected community networks in the following states and Tribal Nations:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Arizona</strong>:<ul><li>San Carlos Apache Tribe</li></ul><ul><li>Tohono O&#8217;odham Nation</li></ul><ul><li>Cocopah Indian Tribe</li></ul></li><li><strong>Georgia</strong><ul><li>Southwest Georgia Regional Commission: Counties of Mitchell, Baker, Calhoun, Colquitt, Decatur, Dougherty, Early, Grady, Lee, Seminole, Miller, Terrell, Thomas, and Worth</li></ul><ul><li>Ben Hill County and City of Fitzgerald<strong></strong></li></ul><ul><li>Emanuel County and City of Twin City</li></ul></li><li><strong>Kentucky</strong><ul><li>Fulton County Partnership*<strong>: </strong>Cities of Fulton, Hickman, and Cayce</li></ul><ul><li>Kentucky Highlands: Counties of Bell*, Perry*, Harlan*, Leslie*, Letcher*, Whitley, Knox, Clay*</li></ul></li><li><strong>Mississippi</strong><ul><li>Washington County Economic Alliance: Counties of Washington, Bolivar, Sunflower, and Leflore</li></ul><ul><li>Greater Grenada-Lake District: Counties of Grenada and Yalobusha</li></ul><ul><li>North Delta Planning and Development Collaborative: Counties of Coahoma, Quitman, and Tunica</li></ul></li><li><strong>New Mexico</strong><ul><li>Northern New Mexico Pathways: Counties of San Miguel, Taos, Mora, and Colfax</li></ul><ul><li>Southwest New Mexico Council of Governments: Counties of Catron, Grant, Hidalgo, and Luna</li></ul><ul><li>Mesilla Valley Partnership: Doña Ana County</li></ul></li></ul>



<p>*Priority Energy Community as determined by the Interagency Working Group on Coal and Power Plant Communities and Economic Revitalization.</p>



<p>These states and community networks were selected by USDA based on quantitative and qualitative factors, including levels of economic distress and readiness of the communities and local stakeholder organizations to participate in RPN. As part of the selection process, USDA conducted community engagement sessions with local community leaders. The communities themselves determined the composition of their networks.</p>



<p>In addition to this first cohort, RPN will expand to <strong>Nevada, North Carolina, Puerto Rico, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Tribal communities in Alaska</strong> in a second cohort to launch by the end of August. If provided the support from Congress requested in the President’s FY23 Budget, RPN will continue expanding to ultimately serve all 50 states, as well as more Tribal Nations and territories.</p>



<p><strong>Empowering rural communities to foster a federal government that better delivers for rural America</strong><strong>. </strong>RPN field staff will be tasked with feeding key information to federal agencies on community needs and barriers to accessing federal resources. Agencies will then take this information and use it to drive policy changes that address the unique challenges faced by rural communities. As a result, RPN will not only support selected RPN community networks but inform changes that make the federal government better deliver for all rural communities.</p>



<p>Through this new direct line between rural communities and Washington, D.C., the Biden Administration will change business as usual and work across agencies to coordinate technical assistance to rural communities, share rural data and measures of success, and align grant requirements. Members of Congress across the political spectrum have called for this whole-of-government approach, including U.S. Senators Catherine Cortez Masto, Joni Ernst, Kirsten Gillibrand, Chuck Grassley, and Mark Kelly, and U.S. Representatives Angie Craig, Dan Newhouse, Cindy Axne, Adrian Smith, Tom O’Halleran, and Randy Feenstra.</p>



<p>The federal agencies and regional commissions participating in the Rural Prosperity Interagency Policy Council include:</p>



<ul><li>Department of Agriculture</li><li>Department of Commerce</li><li>Department of Education</li><li>Department of Energy</li><li>Department of Health and Human Services</li><li>Department of Housing and Urban Development</li><li>Department of the Interior</li><li>Department of Labor</li><li>Department of Transportation</li><li>Department of the Treasury</li><li>Department of Veterans Affairs</li><li>Environmental Protection Agency</li><li>Small Business Administration</li><li>Appalachian Regional Commission</li><li>Delta Regional Authority</li><li>Denali Commission</li><li>Northern Border Regional Commission</li></ul>



<p><strong>Creating new whole-of-government resources for rural communities.</strong> Agencies will contribute to whole-of-government rural economic development resource guides and other informational material that will help all rural communities better identify and access federal funds. Agencies will also proactively conduct outreach to rural communities and rural leaders to disseminate information, offer technical assistance support, and seek input regarding the economic development barriers they face and support they need.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">New Hampshire Port Authority<br>Portsmouth, New Hampshire</p>



<p>2:53 P.M. EDT</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Thank you, thank you, thank you, Mr. Mayor.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Please, take a seat if you have one.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I once, several years ago, said, “Everybody take a seat.”&nbsp; There were about &#8212; it was an evening &#8212; there were about 2,000 people out in the &#8212; in a football field, and it was towards the end of a campaign.&nbsp; I said, “Have a seat.”&nbsp; And they all looked at me like, “We’re standing &#8212; all of it.”&nbsp; (Laughter.) &nbsp;I couldn’t see.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>But anyway, thank you very, very much.</p>



<p>Look, it’s great to be here in Portsmouth with your senator, Maggie Hassan, who’s been one of my friends for a long, long time, and to talk about investments we’re making to modernize this port and create jobs and bring down the cost for families in this region in everyday life.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Maggie was a key player in the Infrastructure Law.&nbsp; And it’s making a difference here in New Hampshire and, I might add, around the country.&nbsp; She made the case for high-speed Internet everywhere in New Hampshire and, you know, protecting New Hampshire’s coastlines from rising sea levels and extreme storms, and for the investments in New Hampshire’s roads and bridges, ports and waterways.</p>



<p>And, Representative Chris Pappas, thank you for a passport into your district.&nbsp; Chris, where are you?&nbsp; Is Chris over here?&nbsp; Well, thanks for the passport, ole buddy, into the district.&nbsp; I appreciate it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And he’s a member of the committee that got this bill across the finish line.&nbsp; Getting big ideas into an actual bill is hard work, requiring getting into the nitty-gritty details and without losing the big picture.</p>



<p>(A baby babbles.)</p>



<p>I agree.&nbsp; I agree completely.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; By the way, kids are allowed to do anything they want when I speak &#8212; at all.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; So don’t worry about it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And &#8212; but, Chris, thank you for all the work you did.&nbsp; And you did a hell of a lot of work to get this done, and always making the economic case for how clean water, access to the Internet, rebuilding a bridge, investing in this port matters to your lives, the lives of your families, and, quite frankly, to the entire region.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And Representative Annie Kuster, an old good friend of mine &#8212; it’s good to see you as well, Annie.&nbsp; Thank you for everything.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>Annie and I have talked a lot about what we need to do to support New Hampshire’s parents and give them just a little bit of breathing room because sometimes things get tight.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And even though she can’t be here, I also wanted to recognize Jeanne Shaheen, who is well represented today by her husband Billy and the family.&nbsp; Billy, where are you?&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; If I can only have one guy in the foxhole with me, I’d pick Billy.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Good to see you, Billy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>And &#8212; and I want to thank &#8212; because she’s sitting next to her.&nbsp; She doesn’t hold any office but a really good friend of mine.&nbsp; Her mom used to be a significant political figure up here.&nbsp; It’s great to see you, kiddo.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Thank you, thank you for being here.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>I also want to thank Chris and Maggie and Jeanne and Annie for all they did to prove that America can do big things when we work together.&nbsp; You know, we &#8212; we can build a better America.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’re the only country in the world that, I believe, that has come out of every crisis we’ve faced stronger than when we went in &#8212; literally stronger than we went in.&nbsp; That’s the history of the journey of this country.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>And this port is a perfect example.&nbsp; A lot of important things come into these terminals and particularly this one &#8212; from salt to de-ice roads, to 85 percent of the home heating oil used in this state.</p>



<p>And a lot of important things go out of this port as well, like the massive reactor assemblies for nuclear power plants that are manufactured by Westinghouse Electric here in New Hampshire.</p>



<p>Recently, this port has been an important link to more construction equipment and materials for a $2.3 billion project that I’ve authorized in Portsmouth Naval Shipyard &#8212; 2.3 billion.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; But it wouldn’t happen without you all and what you’ve done.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, I know they say the port is in Maine, but I’ve always thought it was in New Hampshire.&nbsp; But &#8212; (applause) &#8212; that’s what Billy taught me.&nbsp; And where the Navy’s nuclear-powered attack submarines are built as well and are stationed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Look, all in, this port supports over 2,300 jobs &#8212; 2,300 jobs; adds $275 million to this region’s economy, and that’s not even counting the more than 6,000 civilian contractors and jobs here at &#8212; over at the Navy yard.&nbsp; Jobs in Maine, New Hampshire, and all around the region.</p>



<p>But this port has even more potential than that.&nbsp; Until recently, the area in the harbor called the “turning basin” was only 800 feet long and often meant that pilots had to turn around a 765-foot ship in 800 feet.&nbsp; I call that tough parallel parking, man.</p>



<p>But seriously &#8212; and it meant that, you know, to be safe, some of the ships could only come in or sail out on high tide, they could only sail at night, or when there was &#8212; they couldn’t sail when there was too much wind.&nbsp; They couldn’t &#8212; and &#8212; because they’d get knocked off course.</p>



<p>And that &#8212; here’s why it matters: When you keep a ship in dock after the cargo has been delivered, it can cost $90,000 a day when that ship is in port.&nbsp; And those costs get paid on &#8212; get passed on to you, consumers &#8212; whatever it happens to be.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It also has been a problem for decades.&nbsp; But with an $18 million investment from the Army Corps of Engineers and the help of Maggie and Chris, the port &#8212; and union labor &#8212; we widened that turning basin to 1,200 feet.&nbsp; We got it done.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>Now it’s easier, faster, and cheaper, and safer for ships to get in and out.</p>



<p>And the port can welcome larger ships with more cargo, like the massive towers and hubs needed to &#8212; for offshore wind farms.</p>



<p>Look, we’ve also announced an additional $1.7 million investment to dredge &#8212; another tricky part of a shipping channel where the sands build up.</p>



<p>Without that dredging project, the port might need more restrictions on what ships can and can’t pass through this harbor.</p>



<p>Instead of turning away business, we’re sending a message: This port is open for business and will be for a long time.</p>



<p>And we’re sending the same message with our investments in roads and bridges here in New Hampshire.</p>



<p>Back in November, Maggie, Chris, and Annie were with me when I visited Pemi &#8212; the Pemi bridge in Woodstock &#8212; a couple of hours just northwest of here.</p>



<p>The bridge opened in 1939.&nbsp; Not a big bridge, but it solved big problems.&nbsp; Local businesses depended on it.&nbsp; School buses crossed it every day.&nbsp; Without the bridge, the trucks on the other side of the river would have to take a 10-mile detour to get around to the other side of the river.</p>



<p>Folks, when fires and emergencies &#8212; every single mile matters and counts how long it takes to get there.</p>



<p>Right now, there are nearly 200 bridges deemed deficient</p>



<p>in New Hampshire alone.&nbsp; There’s about 315 such bridges in Maine.&nbsp; And many of these are fast-track &#8212; fast &#8212; less-trafficked bridges that are essential to small towns and rural areas, for farmers and small businesses.</p>



<p>Let me give you an example.&nbsp; I was just in Pittsburgh not long ago &#8212; I guess over &#8212; a little over a month ago.&nbsp; And I got there the morning that one of its bridges collapsed.&nbsp; The bridge was built in 1939, if I’m not mistaken, and had been put on a list of being dangerous.&nbsp; It was about a 12-story drop from the middle of that bridge down to a small creek.&nbsp; And it was in a &#8212; but it was a ravine that covered about 300 yards.</p>



<p>Had it not been &#8212; had it not been a snow day before, there would have been a lot of school buses on that bridge.&nbsp; A lot of kids would have been killed.&nbsp; I’m not joking.&nbsp; You probably saw it on the front page of every paper in America.</p>



<p>Well, guess what?&nbsp; It’s happening all over the country.&nbsp; Fortunately, it didn’t happen there.&nbsp; Fortunately, there was no one on the bridge.&nbsp; There were &#8212; actually, there were four vehicles.&nbsp; No one got killed.</p>



<p>And, you know, I was &#8212; when I was doing the Recovery Act in our last administration &#8212; Obama-Biden &#8212; I was in Pittsburgh &#8212; excuse me, in Pennsylvania, in Western Pennsylvania, in a small town.&nbsp; And in the process, I looked at a bridge, and they couldn’t &#8212; their fire department was on one side of the bridge, and, literally, from here to that holding tank outside here, was &#8212; on the other side there was a shopping center and a school.&nbsp; Well, guess what?&nbsp; Their fire &#8212; you couldn’t get across the bridge; you had to go 10 miles to get around, go up over the bridge, if &#8212; could work, and get back down.&nbsp; People dying in that 10 miles of the fire truck getting there in the middle of a fire.</p>



<p>This matters.&nbsp; So we’re making a historic investments in fixing these bridges.</p>



<p>This year alone, we’re delivering $45 million to fix your bridges here in New Hampshire.&nbsp; This year alone.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>You know, the last fella who had this job kept talking about “Infrastructure Week” for four years.  (Laughter.)  Well, we not only took Infrastructure &#8212; we have “Infrastructure Decade.”  (Applause.)  This is going on.  It’s a billion 200 million dollars.</p>



<p>You know, we used to have the finest infrastructure in the world.&nbsp; We now rank number 13 in the quality of our infrastructure.&nbsp; China is ahead of us.&nbsp; So many other countries have moved.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Folks, this matters.&nbsp; It matters to our safety, our security, our health, and a whole range of other &#8212;</p>



<p>Not only that, about 700 miles of highway in New Hampshire are in poor condition.&nbsp; It’s estimated that the driving on those roads &#8212; those 700 miles &#8212; roughly 700 miles &#8212; that need repairs costs New Hampshire drivers at least an average of $476 a year extra in gas and repairs and longer commute times.&nbsp; That’s a $476 hidden tax on New Hampshire drivers.</p>



<p>Look, thanks to the Infrastructure Law, we’re making the most significant investment in modernizing our roads and bridges</p>



<p>since the Interstate Highway System was built with Eisenhower.</p>



<p>We’re also going to start to replace the 100 percent &#8212; all 100 percent of lead water pipes and service lines going into our homes and our schools.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>There are 10 million homes and 400,000 schools and preschools and daycare centers that have lead water pipes bringing the water in.&nbsp; Many of that causes mental illness, brain damage.&nbsp; It’s really important.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’re also going to address what they call PFAS; it’s a dangerous forever chemicals that are a threat to drinking water</p>



<p>here in New Hampshire and other states &#8212; something that Senator Shaheen has championed.</p>



<p>Look, every American and every child should be able to</p>



<p>turn on a faucet, drink clean water, which will also create thousands of good-paying jobs for plumbers, pipefitters, and the folks digging those channels.</p>



<p>And, by the way, thanks to the American Rescue Plan, New Hampshire is already seeing $150 million being put into drinking water, wastewater, and storm sewer projects in this state as I speak.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>Maggie, Chris, and Annie, we share a core belief: High-speed Internet is essential &#8212; essential &#8212; to success in the 21st century.</p>



<p>But even today, 1 in every 10 people in New Hampshire &#8212; every 1 in 10 households don’t have high-speed Internet.  That’s a lot of place where there’s no broadband or &#8212; infrastructure at all in New Hampshire.</p>



<p>It’s not just New Hampshire families, but for New Hampshire businesses as well.</p>



<p>This law is going to make high-speed Internet affordable and available everywhere in New Hampshire, Maine, and the region &#8212; urban, suburban, rural.&nbsp; And it’s going to create jobs. &nbsp;Thousands of union techni- &#8212; thousands of union technicians are going to be laying down these broadband lines.</p>



<p>And never again should a parent have to sit in their car in a McDonald’s parking lot &#8212; literally &#8212; so that their child can get access to high-speed Internet to do their homework over the Internet.&nbsp; Literally.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Folks, look, the law also builds up our &#8212; our resilience to extreme weather.</p>



<p>Fifteen years ago this week, this state experienced its second 100-year flood in the space of 11 months.&nbsp; Cars submerged.&nbsp; Thousands of evacuations.&nbsp; People lost everything they owned, twice.</p>



<p>Our infrastructure law upgrades stormwater management systems and builds new transmission lines and towers so fewer will be flooded out of their homes or lose power days and weeks because of these storms.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There’s so much more in this law.&nbsp; I’m not going to bore you with the rest of it.&nbsp; But it’s &#8212; it’s significant.</p>



<p>Look, we’ve made a lot of progress, and we have an incredible opportunity ahead of us.&nbsp; But we know what families are still struggling with higher prices.&nbsp; I grew up in a family where the price of gasoline went up at the pump, it was a discussion at the kitchen table.&nbsp; Because my dad &#8212; he was a good man, made a decent living, but always on the margins.&nbsp; Everything mattered.</p>



<p>So let’s be absolutely clear about why we have such high prices now.&nbsp; There are two reasons.&nbsp; First was COVID.</p>



<p>The way the global economy works: If a factory in Vietnam makes computer chips and shuts down in Vietnam because of a COVID outbreak, it causes a ripple effect to slow down manufacturing in Detroit where they need those &#8212; those semiconductors to build the automobiles.</p>



<p>So because of the pandemic, we had disruptions in our supply of important materials, so prices went up.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I said, just look at automobiles.&nbsp; Last year alone, they accounted for one third of all the inflation in America because the price went up, because so fewer &#8212; fewer were being made.&nbsp; Automobile companies couldn’t get the computer chips, and the price of automobiles skyrocketed.</p>



<p>So I’m calling on Congress to pass the bipartisan Innovation Bill to make more of these chips here at home and speed the supply.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Intel came to see me &#8212; the chairman of the board of Intel.&nbsp; He said, “I want to be able to invest $20 billion to build a computer chip factories in &#8212; just west of Cleveland.”<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If, in fact, we get this other piece of legislation, which is in &#8212; passed one House and not the other, we’re going to &#8212; he’s going to invest another $100 billion &#8212; $100 billion.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You know what the average job of &#8212; over 7,000 construction jobs and 3,800 full-time jobs.&nbsp; Average salary of the full-time jobs &#8212; and there &#8212; many of them are blue-collar jobs &#8212; are $126,000 a year.&nbsp; Things are changing.</p>



<p>And the second big reason for inflation is Vladimir Putin.&nbsp; Not a joke.&nbsp; Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has driven up gas prices and food prices all over the world.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two major breadbaskets of wheat in the world were Ukraine and Russia.&nbsp; The United States is number three and Canada number four.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, we saw the most recent inflation data.&nbsp; Last month, about 70 percent of the increase in inflation was a consequence of Putin’s price hike because of the impact on gas and energy prices.</p>



<p>I’m doing everything I can to bring down the price to address Putin’s price hike.&nbsp; That’s why I authorized the release of 1 million barrels per day for the next six months for our st- &#8212; from our Strategic Petroleum Reserve.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I know the press is always asking me, with good reason, why I’m always on the phone talking with other world leaders, trying to keep them organized.&nbsp; Well, one of the things I did &#8212; I went out and got a lot of other countries to agree that they would release petroleum from their oil reserves.</p>



<p>So, we worked with the U.S. oil producers to ramp up the production &#8212; (applause) &#8212; and we coordinated this release with partners and allies around the world.&nbsp; And shortly after I made the announcement, another 30 countries agreed to 60 million additional barrels a day on the market.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So now we have 240 million barrels a day for the next six months.&nbsp; That’s the largest collective reserve release in history.&nbsp; Nations coming together to help deny Putin the ability to weaponize his energy resources against American families and families in Europe and around the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But there’s more that needs to be done.&nbsp; And Americans should already be seeing the savings.&nbsp; Although it’s only gone down about 18 cents, the savings are starting.</p>



<p>Beyond gas prices, I’ve called on Congress to move immediately to lower the cost of family utility bills, prescription drug bills, and more, while lowering the deficit and reducing inflation.&nbsp; That would make a big difference for families.&nbsp; We can do a lot of these things without raising a single penny on taxes of anyone making less than $400,000 a year.&nbsp; Nobody making less than $400,000 will see a single penny in their taxes raised.</p>



<p>It’s the best way Congress can address inflation right now.</p>



<p>And, folks, look, the fact is that we are in a situation where the war in Ukraine is going to continue to take its toll on the world economy.&nbsp; It’s going to take its toll on energy, and it’s going to take its toll relative to food.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When I was running for office &#8212; you heard it a thousand times from me: that we&#8217;re going to build an economy around you.&nbsp; I&#8217;m so tired of trickle-down economics.&nbsp; And I never found that trickle down on top of my head very much.&nbsp; I was listed &#8212; I was &#8212; had the great pleasure of being listed as the poorest man in Congress for 36 years.&nbsp; I still had &#8212; making a hell of a lot more money than anybody else because I was getting a senator’s salary.&nbsp; No kidding.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t think you should make money while you&#8217;re in office.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But, at any rate, the point of it is this: An awful lot of people are hurting.&nbsp; It makes a big difference.&nbsp; It makes a big difference.&nbsp; The cost of a dozen eggs, the cost of a gallon of gasoline, it matters.&nbsp; It matters.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So I concluded, when I ran this last time, that we&#8217;re going to build this economy from the bottom up and the middle out, because when that happens, everybody does well.&nbsp; The wealthy do very well and the poor have a ladder up, and the middle class has a little bit of breathing room.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I grew up in a household where we lived in a split-level home &#8212; three bedrooms, four kids, mom and dad, and a grandpop who lived with us.&nbsp; And I remember one night, you could &#8212; you know, the walls were kind of thin.&nbsp; I can &#8212; my dad was restless.&nbsp; The next morning, when he went to work, I asked mom what was the problem.&nbsp; She said, “He just noticed his company just said no more &#8212; they’re not going to &#8212; not going to cover health insurance anymore.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>It matters.&nbsp; These things matter to people.&nbsp; They matter to ordinary people.</p>



<p>We can, in fact, provide for anyone who has Type 1 diabetes or a child &#8212; or 200 million &#8212; 200,000 kids who have it.&nbsp; They need that insulin every single day.&nbsp; Average cost is six hundred and forty-seven thou- &#8212; $647 a month, sometimes as low as $90 and as high as $1,000, depending on where you are.</p>



<p>You know how mu- &#8212; made &#8212; how much it costs to make one of those vials of insulin? &nbsp;Ten &#8212; T-E-N &#8212; dollars.&nbsp; Not a single change has been made in that insulin since it was first discovered.</p>



<p>And so, we could set that price at maximum of $35.&nbsp; They still make a significant profit.&nbsp; And what they &#8212; what in God&#8217;s name are we doing?</p>



<p>Look, I&#8217;m a capitalist.&nbsp; I think people should be able to go out and make millions of dollars, even a billion if you can make it, but at least pay your fair share.&nbsp; Pay something.&nbsp; (Applause.) &nbsp;Pay something.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By the way, I&#8217;m being deadly earnest.&nbsp; You know, it&#8217;s just &#8212; you know, there are &#8212; I come from the corporate capital of the world, Delaware.&nbsp; More corporations are incorporated in the state of Delaware than every other state in the nation combined &#8212; combined.&nbsp; And I survived winning seven Senate elections in that state.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But here’s the deal: The fact is, folks, that, you know, there are 50 Fortune &#8212; there are 50 of the top 500 corporations in America last year that made a total of $40 billion in profit.&nbsp; They didn&#8217;t pay one single penny &#8212; not one.&nbsp; The average percent that billionaires pay of the 790 of them is about 3.8 percent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just pay your fair share.&nbsp; We can do all these things.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, by the way, one last thing: You know, the budget I submitted &#8212; my first budget that passed and became law, it cut the federal deficit by $350 billion.&nbsp; We cut the deficit $350 billion.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>And the budget I proposed this year, if it comes to total fruition, it will cut the deficit by one trillion three hundred billion dollars.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>So when my Republican friends start talking about “big spenders” and the reason why there&#8217;s inflation, take a look. Take a look.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve cut the deficit drastically.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, look, we&#8217;re making progress.&nbsp; Over the course of my presidency, our recovery so far has created 7.9 million new jobs &#8212; (applause) &#8212; more jobs &#8212; more jobs created over the first 14 months than any President ever.&nbsp; Over 420,000 manufacturing jobs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unemployment rate is at 3.6 percent, down from 6.4 percent.  In the state of New Hampshire, you&#8217;re down from &#8212; I think it&#8217;s 4.2 percent to 3.2 [sic] percent.</p>



<p>Folks, in Maine you&#8217;ve added 28,000 jobs, and unemployment has dropped from 4.4 to 3.6.&nbsp;</p>



<p>New Hampshire, 26,000 new jobs.&nbsp; Dropped from 4.2 &#8212; I was &#8212; misspoke &#8212; to 2.5 &#8212; 2.5 percent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last year, as I said, we cut the deficit by more than 350 thousa- &#8212; billion dollars.&nbsp; This year, we’re on track for $1.3 trillion in cuts.&nbsp; And look, that would be the largest debt reduction in American history.</p>



<p>And it’s particularly important now we ask ourselves: How are we going to reduce pressure on inflation?</p>



<p>Maine, New Hampshire, and America have gone on the mend. &nbsp;They’re on the &#8212; they’re not on the mend any longer; they’re on the move.&nbsp; And we’re coming to &#8212; at our challenges from a position of strength.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But I’m more optimistic about America today than I’ve ever been in my whole career, because I see the future that’s within our grasp.&nbsp; We can’t be afraid though.&nbsp; We’re the only nation on Earth, as I’ve said, that has always turned every single, solitary crisis we’ve had into an opportunity.&nbsp; And that’s exactly what we’re going to do today if we do it together.</p>



<p>It’s about being together &#8212; the United States of America.&nbsp; When we do that, there’s not a single thing we can’t do.</p>



<p>But God bless you all, and may God protect our troops.&nbsp; Thank you, thank you, thank you.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;</p>

<p>On April 18, National Security Council Indo-Pacific Coordinator Kurt Campbell and Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Daniel Kritenbrink convened a meeting in Honolulu with U.S. Navy Adm. John C. Aquilino, Commander, U.S. Indo-Pacific Command and senior officials from Australia, Japan, and New Zealand on developments in the Pacific Islands. In Honolulu, the officials reaffirmed the four countries’ enduring and shared commitment to the Pacific Islands. The United States resolved to intensify its engagement in the region to meet 21st-century challenges, from maritime security and economic development to the climate crisis and COVID-19. We will do this in ever-closer partnership with Pacific Island nations, including through a united Pacific Islands Forum; and together with like-minded countries, within and beyond the region, including in Europe. Officials from the four countries represented also shared concerns about a proposed security framework between the Solomon Islands and the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and its serious risks to a free and open Indo-Pacific. The meeting was part of regular and extensive U.S. consultations with allies and partners on the Indo-Pacific and is part of the announced senior administration travel this week to Hawaii, Fiji, Papua New Guinea, and the Solomon Islands.</p>

<p>Today, Jennifer Klein, White House Gender Policy Council Director, and Julie Chavez Rodriguez, White House Intergovernmental Affairs Director, hosted a roundtable discussion with state legislators from Missouri, Nebraska, and Oklahoma to discuss their efforts to protect access to reproductive health care, in light of a series of unconstitutional attacks on women’s reproductive rights.</p>



<p>During the meeting, state legislators reported on abortion restrictions in their states and shared steps they have taken to oppose new legislative proposals. Leaders in Oklahoma described the potential impact of recently-passed S 612, which makes providing an abortion a criminal offense in the state, with narrow exceptions. Nebraska lawmakers shared their recent success in fighting a trigger ban, which failed on the legislature floor earlier this month and would have banned abortion in the state if <em>Roe</em> were overturned. State legislators from Missouri described their efforts to oppose a number of pending restrictions. All participants underscored the devastating impact these bills would have on access to critical reproductive health care services, especially for low-income populations and those living in rural communities.</p>



<p>Senior Administration officials underscored the Administration’s support for reproductive rights and determination to protect access to health care. They thanked the legislators for their leadership in opposing and raising awareness about these dangerous bills, and made it clear that the Administration stands with them in the fight to protect reproductive health care.</p>



<p>The legislation discussed today is just a sample of the onerous and unconstitutional restrictions that have passed or are pending in states across the nation. In light of this wholesale attack on reproductive rights, Administration officials reiterated the President’s support for the constitutional right affirmed in <em>Roe v. Wade</em> and his commitment to protect women’s access to critical reproductive health care.</p>



<p>State legislators participated in today’s meeting included:</p>



<ul><li>Missouri Senator Jill Schupp</li><li>Missouri Representative Emily Weber</li><li>Nebraska Senator Machaela Cavanaugh</li><li>Nebraska Senator Adam Morfeld</li><li>Oklahoma House Minority Leader Emily Virgin</li><li>Oklahoma Representative Forrest Bennett</li><li>Oklahoma Representative Ajay Pittman</li></ul>

<p><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/29/fact-sheet-strategy-to-address-the-root-causes-of-migration-in-central-america/">Vice President Harris launched the Root Causes Strategy</a> on July 29, 2021, to align U.S. Government efforts to address the economic, governance, and security drivers of irregular migration from Central America.  Tackling the persistent challenges that drive irregular migration requires sustained political will and cooperation across a broad range of stakeholders to foster long-term development in the region.  The Vice President has led progress on the Administration’s Strategy, including by traveling to <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/07/fact-sheet-u-s-guatemala-cooperation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Guatemala</a>, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/11/18/remarks-by-vice-president-harris-and-president-lopez-obrador-of-mexico-before-bilateral-meeting/">Mexico</a>, and <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/01/27/readout-of-vice-president-harriss-meeting-with-president-castro-of-honduras/">Honduras</a> to launch new initiatives that sustainably address the root causes of migration. </p>



<p>Recognizing the important role for the private sector, Vice President Harris brought together private sector leaders through a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/12/13/vice-president-kamala-harris-announces-new-commitments-as-part-of-the-call-to-action-for-the-private-sector-to-deepen-investment-in-central-america-now-totaling-over-1-2-billion/"><em>Call to Action,</em></a><em> </em>which has resulted in over $1.2 billion in private sector commitments in Central America to create new jobs and opportunities for people in the region.&nbsp; Vice President Harris also engaged partners around the world to support our work and generate new commitments.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Biden-Harris Administration’s strategy represents a comprehensive approach to promoting inclusive economic growth in the region with a sharp focus on strengthening democratic governance and combatting corruption, women’s empowerment, climate change, human rights, security and curbing gender-based violence.&nbsp; It integrates various U.S. Government tools, including foreign assistance, development finance, public diplomacy, and economic sanctions and visa restrictions.&nbsp; Because the region’s long-term development will require more than just the resources of the U.S. Government, the Strategy forges strong partnerships with the private sector and international partners.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Mobilizing Private Sector Investment</strong></p>



<p>The Vice President’s leadership has brought together private sector leaders through a <em>Call to Action</em>.&nbsp; In collaboration with the Partnership for Central America, this has resulted in &nbsp;more than $1.2 billion in private sector commitments in Central America to create new jobs and opportunities for people in the region.&nbsp; The <em>Call to Action’s</em> six focus areas are intended to support long-term development of the region.&nbsp; They are: promoting a reform agenda; digital and financial inclusion; food security and climate-smart agriculture; climate adaptation and clean energy; education and workforce development; and public health access.</p>



<p>Companies that have made investments and commitments in the region include Microsoft, Nespresso, Mastercard, CARE International, Cargill, Grupo Mariposa, Parkdale Mills, PepsiCo, JDE Peet’s, and PriceSmart.&nbsp; These initial commitments are already bearing fruit.&nbsp; Some highlights include:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Internet Access:&nbsp; </strong>Microsoft catalyzed the development of digital access training centers, clean off-grid energy, and broadband access covering a population of 1.1 million people, and is on track to connect 4 million people to broadband by 2024.</li><li><strong>Support for Farmers</strong>:&nbsp; Nespresso works with over 1,200 farms in Guatemala to improve livelihoods in the region. The company announced its first-ever coffee sourcing from Honduras and El Salvador, with plans to increase activities in the region for the next harvest season. This is part of the company&#8217;s commitment to support the region&#8217;s economy with a minimum of $150 million to be spent across coffee purchases, price premiums, and technical assistance by 2025.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Digital and Financial Inclusion</strong>:&nbsp; Mastercard committed to bring five million people in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras into the formal financial economy and to digitize one million micro and small businesses.<strong>&nbsp; </strong>The company established a Digital Country Partnership with Guatemala’s Ministry of the Economy, accelerating their work to bring five million people in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras into the formal financial economy.&nbsp; This will also enable one million micro and small businesses to access online payment and management systems.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Job Creation and Supply Chain Resilience</strong>:&nbsp; Parkdale Mills is investing $150 million in a new yarn spinning facility in Honduras.&nbsp; This support will provide customers with sources for purchasing one million pounds of yarn per week within the region while increasing U.S. supply chain resilience. The investment is intended to support roughly 500 employees at each location and increase indirect job growth in Honduras and in the United States, particularly in the U.S. cotton industry across 18 states. The investment also includes $24 million in new investments in solar energy, water recapture, and energy efficient HVAC systems.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Infrastructure and Renewable Energy Investments</strong>:&nbsp; PepsiCo will invest at least $190 million in northern Central America through 2025.&nbsp; The company’s planned investments include improvements to its infrastructure and manufacturing plants; expansion of new distribution routes; IT projects; and investments aligned with its “pep+” (PepsiCo Positive) agenda. This includes spreading regenerative farming practices across seven million acres (which is approximately the size of the company’s entire agricultural footprint), becoming Net Water Positive by 2030 by reducing absolute water use and replenishing watersheds, and achieving net-zero emissions by 2040 by increasing the use of renewable energy, among other efforts.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Support for Small Businesses</strong>:&nbsp; Grupo Mariposa will provide over 70,000 small-business owners with access to credit and digital services.&nbsp; It will also support 3,500 small and medium-enterprises with access to telemedicine, education, and Internet connectivity, impacting more than 200,000 people and expanding healthcare and telemedicine solutions to 2,000 remote communities. In addition, it will invest more than $10 million to grow its coffee footprint, creating more than 500 new jobs and supporting more than 400 small and medium-sized coffee producers to increase productivity and earnings potential. <a></a></li></ul>



<ul><li>CARE announced its plans to establish a $50 million Center for Gender Equity in Central America focused on women and young people and designed to reach 500,000 individual women and their families, impacting two million people in total.&nbsp; The Center will support public and private programs in the region – scaling up those that work – to support financial inclusion, women’s economic empowerment (including in the protection of labor rights and in supporting entrepreneurship), improved agricultural outcomes, and reductions in gender-based violence. In particular, CARE will support companies joining the Call to Action with technical assistance to ensure that a gender-based lens is applied to new programs and investment.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Creating Economic Opportunity</strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>Job Creation:</strong>&nbsp; In Fiscal Year 2021, USAID support to private sector firms in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras helped create more than 70,000 jobs, spurred $415 million in sales, and supported agricultural producers to gain access to $860 million in financing.&nbsp; In Honduras, USAID helped establish a new $20 million loan facility to lend to underserved agricultural clients, especially women agribusiness owners.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Mobilizing Investment:</strong>&nbsp; Through USAID’s Guatemalan Entrepreneurship and Development Innovation initiative, announced by Vice President Harris in June 2021, USAID has leveraged $59 million, against its $7.5 million investment, from international and local private sector partners to scale technology-driven, market-led solutions to critical development challenges throughout the country.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Public-Private Partnerships:</strong>&nbsp; U.S. Government advocacy contributed to Guatemala’s first public-private partnership (PPP) project in November 2021, which will extend and repair the highway that connects the capital with the country’s primary Pacific port, Puerto Quetzal, and can serve as a model for other infrastructure investment and help Guatemalans bring their products to the global market.&nbsp; The U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA), in December 2021, awarded a feasibility study grant to develop a PPP that would install LED streetlights along more than 500 kilometers of highway across El Salvador to improve safety, increase energy efficiency, and lower energy costs.&nbsp; These PPPs can serve as powerful models for future infrastructure investment collaboration in the region.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Access to Finance:</strong>&nbsp; In October 2021, the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) disbursed $100 million to the Central American Bank for Economic Integration (CABEI) to fund financial institution intermediaries in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras which will then lend to micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) to support economic recovery in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp; The DFC, with USAID funding, provided additional loan guarantees to entities in El Salvador and Honduras to enhance lending to women-led small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and SMEs in high growth sectors of the economy to support economic growth and job creation within historically marginalized communities. &nbsp;In September 2021, USAID finalized a new loan guarantee that is facilitating access to loans for SMEs in the Western Highlands of Guatemala, a region with high levels of out-migration.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Trade Facilitation: &nbsp;</strong>In August 2021, the Department of Commerce’s Commercial Law Development Program (CLDP) and International Trade Administration (ITA) conducted a regional trade facilitation workshop with Guatemalan customs and trade ministries. &nbsp;In May and June of 2022, CLDP will host two workshops in Honduras on customs valuation and communication. &nbsp;These workshops are part of a multiphase effort to promote transparency, cooperation, and coordination among the northern Central American governments and improve inter-regional trade.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Strengthening Health and Education</strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>Vaccine Doses:</strong>&nbsp; To assist people in the region in combating the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. Government has delivered more than 15 million free-of-cost vaccine doses bilaterally and in partnership with COVAX to countries in northern Central America.&nbsp;Vaccination rates are steadily increasing in all three countries with Guatemala at 33 percent, Honduras at 46 percent, and El Salvador at 66 percent of their populations completing the initial COVID-19 vaccination protocol.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Vaccine Financing:</strong>&nbsp; In September 2021, the DFC, in conjunction with Citigroup Inc., provided a risk management solution to Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, to mitigate risk and overcome financial hurdles with governments that are funding COVID-19 vaccine purchases through the COVAX Facility.&nbsp; Of the $383 million in political risk insurance provided to Gavi, $50 million was provided to support allocation of vaccines to Guatemala.</li></ul>



<ul><li>&nbsp; The U.S. Government has provided $26.4 million to El Salvador, $81.5 million to Guatemala, and $57.1 million to Honduras to support the fight against COVID-19 and strengthen health systems.&nbsp; Assistance is supporting training health care workers and public health staff in critical care management and safe and effective administration of vaccines, building laboratory capacity, strengthening contact tracing efforts, sharing critical information to prevent the spread of disease, providing technical assistance for the health information systems needed to evaluate vaccine distribution equity and monitor vaccine safety, and bolstering oxygen systems to ensure availability for patients who need them in Guatemala and Honduras.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Education:</strong>&nbsp; In El Salvador in November 2021, USAID launched a $20 million Scholarships for Education Project to curb irregular migration by increasing equitable access to formal educational opportunities for 6,450 returnees and potential migrants.&nbsp; In Honduras, USAID installed Internet hotspots in 60 community learning centers and increased access to remote learning for more than 5,000 people, including more than 600 returned migrant children. USAID also completed repairs on and expansions to two schools in western Honduras, which serve more than 1,800 local students in this area of high out-migration.&nbsp; In Guatemala, USAID provided education assistance to more than 6,300 at-risk youth and launched new partnerships to strengthen English language programs.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Enhancing Climate Resilience and Food Security</strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>Humanitarian Assistance:&nbsp; </strong>Since April 2021, USAID reached approximately 1.9 million people impacted by recurrent droughts, COVID-19, and severe damage from Hurricanes Eta and Iota in northern Central America with life-saving humanitarian assistance such as emergency food assistance, health, livelihoods restoration, protection, shelter as well as water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) support.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Food Security:&nbsp; </strong>The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) provided $30 million to expand its Food for Progress program in Guatemala, which will enable it to reach an additional 18,000 producers.&nbsp; USDA provided $45 million to expand its McGovern-Dole school feeding, health, nutrition, and educational programming in Guatemala and Honduras, reaching an additional 124,000 beneficiaries, with a projection of nearly 400,000 beneficiaries over the life of the program.<strong>&nbsp; </strong>In addition, in Fiscal Year 2021, USAID’s Feed the Future activities in Honduras directly assisted nearly 16,000 farm families and agribusinesses in adopting technologies to increase yields.&nbsp; This assistance contributed to over $23 million in incremental sales.&nbsp; In Guatemala, USAID’s Feed the Future activities created nearly 30,000 jobs and over $76 million in sales while leveraging over $10 million in financing and $6 million in investment in the agricultural sector.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Combating Corruption</strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>Anti-Corruption Task Force:</strong>&nbsp; In June 2021, Vice President Harris announced the establishment of the Department of Justice’s Anti-Corruption Task Force (ACTF). The ACTF subsequently created a new tip line for reporting corruption in the region and the FBI has reviewed and followed up on the resulting tips.&nbsp; The ACTF continues to operate the tip line and relies on relationships with counterparts, witnesses, cooperators and others in the region to streamline and prioritize investigations.&nbsp; In addition, the number of Department of Justice Resident Legal Advisors (RLAs), supported by the Department of State, was increased throughout the region, and RLAs continue to work with their counterparts in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras.&nbsp; In November 2021, an RLA-assisted Honduran anti-corruption unit secured guilty verdicts against the former minister of health and former minister of labor on charges of embezzlement, bribery, fraud, and money laundering.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Sanctions and Visa Restrictions:&nbsp; </strong>In December 2021, the Department of the Treasury imposed sanctions on officials in El Salvador and Guatemala in connection with public corruption pursuant to the Global Magnitsky sanctions program, which allows for the targeting of corruption and serious human rights abuse.&nbsp; In addition, the Department of State publicly designated several Guatemalan and Salvadoran officials under Section 7031(c) of the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act for their involvement in significant corruption, generally rendering them and their immediate family members ineligible for entry into the United States.&nbsp; Prior to these actions, the Department of State publicly included multiple current and former officials and private individuals on the Section 353 Corrupt and Undemocratic Actors List generally rendering these individuals ineligible for visas and admission to the United States.&nbsp;In August 2021, the United States also launched a new visa restriction authority under Section 212(1)(3)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act on the issuance of visas to current or former Guatemalan, Honduran, or Salvadoran government officials and other individuals believed to be responsible for, or complicit in, undermining democracy or the rule of law.&nbsp; <strong></strong></li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Audit and Oversight:</strong>&nbsp; To promote transparency and fight corruption, USAID trained 100 auditors in Guatemala’s Specialized Center for Tax and Customs Crimes to better identify tax crimes, donated computer equipment for use in field audits, and provided technical assistance on the documentation of criminal complaints.&nbsp; With USAID support, the Center has recovered nearly $80 million in tax revenue since its inception.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Advancing Democracy, Promoting the Rule of Law, and Protecting Human Rights</strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>Democratic Elections:</strong>&nbsp; The Department of State and USAID engaged all levels of Honduran society and the government ahead of the November 2021 presidential election to promote free, fair, and peaceful elections that reflected the will of Honduran voters.&nbsp; USAID assistance helped facilitate the country’s election through support to journalists and civil society organizations to objectively report on information about the election process, independent analyses that informed recommendations on elections security, and get out the vote campaigns.&nbsp; USAID also supported the strengthening of electoral management bodies.&nbsp; The Department of State supported training for police officers in advance of the elections, including content on the use of force and relevant election laws and procedures, and distributed 20,000 election day pocket guides to police officers emphasizing the importance of respecting the rights of all citizens to vote.&nbsp; The election, characterized by high voter turnout, resulted in the peaceful election of the country’s first woman president.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul><li>&nbsp; Across the northern Central American countries, the Department of State and USAID worked together to promote human rights, labor rights, and press freedom.&nbsp; USAID increased resources to respond to rising protection needs, providing critical support to journalists, human rights defenders, and anti-corruption champions. &nbsp;USAID provided timely assistance to more than 30 human rights defenders and democracy advocates in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. &nbsp;To respond to high rates of extortion, human trafficking, and violence among marginalized sexual and gender minority individuals, USAID supported LGBTQI+ civil society organizations to address regressive policies and advocate for reforms to key laws.&nbsp; In Honduras, this included advocating for transgender individuals to be able to legally register under their chosen names, rather than the names on their birth certificates under the law governing the National Persons Registry. &nbsp;A public petition garnered more than 4,000 signatures before submission to the Honduran National Congress in November 2021.&nbsp; As the Congress considers its response, LGBTQI+ advocacy groups are engaged in related advocacy and policy efforts to further promote necessary protections. In addition, U.S. Southern Command’s Human Rights Initiative has efforts in all three northern Central American countries, helping to institutionalize respect for human rights in partner nation armed forces doctrine and professional education.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>New Technical Assistance to Promote Labor Rights:&nbsp; </strong>The Department of Labor (DOL) recently announced $20 million in new programs in northern Central America.&nbsp; Activities will focus on increasing collective action to address child and forced labor and improve occupational safety and health conditions of workers in the region.&nbsp; Efforts also will improve the ability of workers to exercise their labor rights in agricultural supply chains in Guatemala and Honduras and the textile/apparel sector in El Salvador.&nbsp; <strong>&nbsp;</strong></li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Labor Roundtables:&nbsp;</strong>In June and July 2021, DOL hosted nine labor roundtables, convening over 50 unions and civil society organizations from the United States, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras to discuss the nexus between labor issues and migration.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p><strong>Combating Crime and Increasing Security&nbsp;</strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>Human Smuggling:&nbsp; </strong>In June 2021, Vice President Harris announced the creation of a regional task force to identify, disrupt, and prevent migrant smuggling and human trafficking operations.Working with partners in the region, the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security’s Joint Task Force Alpha, which targets human smuggling, continues to identify and pursue priority human smuggling cases for prosecution within the United States.&nbsp; Department of Justice RLAs, with Department of State support, are working with counterparts in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras to pursue investigations and prosecutions.&nbsp; In November 2021, prosecutors mentored by RLAs obtained indictments against twenty members of a human smuggling organization (HSO) that operated throughout El Salvador and Guatemala.&nbsp; In a coordinated effort, Guatemalan police and prosecutors also executed search warrants at five locations linked to the same HSO.&nbsp; In January 2022, as part of another coordinated investigation with DHS’s Homeland Security Investigations, Guatemalan authorities executed 19 search warrants, seized over $200,000, and arrested ten Guatemalan nationals for violations of foreign law related to human smuggling and money laundering. In Honduras, U.S. government efforts resulted in the formation of a migration task force to focus on investigation and prosecution of smuggling and trafficking networks.&nbsp; Since January 2021 this and other border security programs have resulted in the arrest of 283 alleged human smugglers, the rescue of 200 minors, and a tripling in the number of migrants checked against U.S. criminal and terrorist databases.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Money Laundering:</strong>&nbsp; In November 2021, U.S.-mentored prosecutors in Honduras secured money laundering convictions against seven Honduran nationals who were high-level members of the Byron Ruiz drug trafficking organization previously convicted of aggravated drug trafficking charges in Honduras.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Civilian Law Enforcement:</strong>  The Department of State worked to professionalize security forces across the region by training more than 5,000 civilian police in calendar year 2021 on topics such as community policing, investigations, and human rights. <br></li><li><strong>Conventional Weapons Destruction:  </strong>In 2021, the Department of State provided explosive ordnance disposal and stockpile management training to 86 security forces personnel, destroyed 7.91 metric tons of obsolete munitions, and provided physical security upgrades to vulnerable weapons storage facilities in El Salvador and Guatemala to prevent the illicit pilferage and proliferation of State-held weapons which contribute to armed violence and criminal activity in the region.<br></li><li><strong>Regional Information Sharing:</strong>  The Department of State supported a regional effort to share criminal intelligence about transnational criminal organizations and associated criminals in Central America, with a focus on migrant smuggling and human trafficking.  In 2021, this effort facilitated the identification of nearly 1,200 members of transnational criminal organizations.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Reinsertion of Former Offenders:</strong>&nbsp; In El Salvador, USAID supported an innovative and evidence-based reinsertion model for adult and youth populations exiting prison and gang-involvement, which in the last year has led to a 70 percent success rate of participants receiving employment or consistently participating in skill building support and not re-offending.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong></strong></li></ul>



<p><strong>Focusing on Women and Youth</strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>Gender-Based Violence:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; In February 2022, USAID awarded a $5 million grant to El Refugio de la Niñez, a Guatemalan NGO, to expand education, legal, housing, medical, psychosocial and other services to survivors of trafficking in persons and unaccompanied migrant children. In September 2021, the Department of State supported the design and implementation of a specialized course for Honduran prosecutors on gender-based violence, including domestic violence, which launched with an initial class of 25 prosecutors in February 2022. &nbsp;U.S. support is helping the Honduran National Police revamp its training curriculum to focus on incidents of gender-based violence and train 911 operators on how to prioritize and route the more than 60 reports of such violence daily.&nbsp; U.S. programs are also significantly increasing post-violence victim support and resources.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Young Women&#8217;s Empowerment</strong>:&nbsp; With the June 2021 launch of its $40 million Young Women’s Empowerment Initiative, USAID is partnering with Guatemalan indigenous and women’s organizations, private sector, and international organizations to increase education, professional training, and income-generating opportunities for thousands of indigenous Guatemalan women and girls.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Women Entrepreneurs:</strong>&nbsp; The Department of State’s Academy of Women Entrepreneurs (AWE) program in northern Central America provides women participants the knowledge, networks, and access to launch and scale their businesses through a proven combination of business classes, professional mentoring, and seed money.&nbsp; In September 2021, Honduras added 315 new participants and in November 2021, Guatemala graduated a class of 120 women, including representatives from highland and Afro-Guatemalan Garifuna communities with high rates of emigration, while El Salvador graduated a class of 176 women, 36 of whom received $24,000 in seed capital to invest further in their businesses and create jobs in their communities.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Advancing Women’s Economic Empowerment:</strong>&nbsp; On January 4, 2022, USAID launched the <em>MujerProspera</em> (WomenProsper) challenge, seeking solutions that advance women’s economic security, employment, and/or entrepreneurship in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras.&nbsp; With this challenge, USAID expects to issue up to 14 awards each valued between $150,000 and $500,000 later this spring.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>At-Risk Youth:</strong>&nbsp; Since July 2021, USAID has provided psychosocial support and family counseling, gender-based violence prevention activities, life-skills training, vocational workshops, digital inclusion, sports and arts activities, and alternative education for youth left out of the formal education system for more than 27,500 children and youth in 80 high-crime and out-migration communities of the north, central, and western regions of Honduras.&nbsp; The Department of State worked with certified Gang Resistance Education and Training (G.R.E.A.T.) instructors across Honduras to reach more than 100,000 children and help strengthen their ability to resist gang recruitment. In El Salvador, USAID launched a $20 million alliance (which includes $10 million in private sector leverage) with local partner Glasswing International to improve citizen security in targeted Salvadoran communities to help reduce irregular migration, with a goal of reaching 30,000 people (mostly youth) in five years with economic and educational opportunities.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Enhancing Partnerships</strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>Engaging Local Organizations:</strong>&nbsp; In November 2021, USAID announced <em>Centroamérica Local</em>, a five-year, $300 million initiative to empower local organizations in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras to address the drivers of irregular migration to the United States.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Cooperation with Mexico:</strong>&nbsp; In December 2021, the United States and Mexico announced <em>Sembrando Oportunidades</em>, a new framework for development cooperation to address the root causes of irregular migration from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras.&nbsp; These efforts are underway. In El Salvador, USAID is providing scholarships to graduates of Mexico’s youth workforce program, and in Honduras, USAID and its Mexican counterpart aim to reach more than 500,000 at-risk youth with skills and experience that can lead to long-term employment.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Diplomatic Engagement Around the World to Address Root Causes</strong></p>



<ul><li>The Vice President has recognized the need to internationalize her efforts, and has been rallying partners around the world to support U.S. efforts to address the root causes of migration. The Vice President’s extensive diplomatic engagement with leaders around the world includes the following important new commitments:</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong><u>Republic of Korea</u></strong>:&nbsp; After the Vice President met with South&nbsp;Korean President&nbsp;Moon Jae-in, the Republican of Korea doubled foreign assistance to northern Central America to $220 million over five years.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong><u>Japan</u></strong>:&nbsp; The Government of Japan committed to closer collaboration and has provided nearly $22 million in assistance to the three countries of northern Central America.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong><u>Israel</u></strong>:&nbsp; The Israeli government announced it would collaborate with USAID on agriculture, watershed management, and violence prevention programs in Guatemala and Honduras.</li></ul>



<p>The Vice President&#8217;s diplomacy helped establish the United Nations Humanitarian Response Plans for Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala. She has worked with the European Union and Canada, which have become the largest donors to the effort after the United States.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Aboard Air Force One<br>En Route Portsmouth, New Hampshire</p>



<p>1:16 P.M. EDT</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Welcome to our trip to New Hampshire.&nbsp; I highlighted a little bit of this yesterday, so I will keep this brief.</p>



<p>But as a reminder, we are headed to Portsmouth.&nbsp; Portsmouth Harbor, which we are visiting, is the only deep-water harbor in New Hampshire and handles approximately 3.5 million tons and nearly $2 billion of cargo a year.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, we awarded $1.7 million from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for maintenance dredging in Portsmouth Harbor through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And the investment builds on an $18.2 million Army Corps project in Portsmouth Harbor for navigation improvement, which widened the uppermost turning basin in the river.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, the President will hear from the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, Coast Guard Commander for Sector Northern New England, and New Hampshire Port Director on the impact of these projects and funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law on the port.</p>



<p>On the ground in Portsmouth, he will also see Governor Chris Sununu; Senator Hassan; Representatives Pappas and Annie &#8212; and Kuster; the mayors of Portsmouth and Manchester; and several other state and local elected officials.</p>



<p>I also wanted to note &#8212; did you all get the P+11 readout?&nbsp; Did it come to you yet?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not yet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Okay, I’m not sure it’s gone out.</p>



<p>So let me &#8212; let me do a couple of highlights from that.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Watch out, Jen.&nbsp; The door is closing.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Oh, thank you.&nbsp; Okay.</p>



<p>As you know, the President had a call with the P+11 this morning, as it was part of our close coordination with Allies and partners.&nbsp; He convened the video conference to discuss their ongoing efforts to support Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The leaders reiterated their commitment to continue providing security, economic, and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine in its time of need.&nbsp; The leaders affirmed their solidarity with the Ukrainian people and condemned the humanitarian suffering caused by Russia&#8217;s unprovoked and unjustified invasion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They also discussed their respective diplomatic engagements and their coordinated efforts to continue to impose severe economic costs to hold Russia accountable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They agreed to continue to closely coordinate their efforts, including working with and through the G7, EU, and NATO.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Okay, with that, yes, go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; On the mask mandate, why is the DOJ not appealing that?&nbsp; And by not, do you &#8212; does the administration risk taking away some of your options for the future, especially if there&#8217;s some new variants?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;Well, unless something&#8217;s happened when we got on the plane, I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;ve made any announcement at this point in time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, as we&#8217;ve said, agencies are reviewing step &#8212; next steps, including the Department of Justice.&nbsp; Traditionally following a court decision, that can take a couple of days.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve said from the start that our COVID response should be guided by the science and data and by experts.&nbsp; And just as a reminder, when we made this announcement, the CDC said it needed 15 days to assess the impacts of an uptick in cases on hospitalizations, deaths, and hospital capacity.&nbsp; We feel &#8212; still feel that is entirely reasonable, based on the latest science, and public health decisions shouldn&#8217;t be made by the courts.&nbsp; They should be made by public health experts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, again, I can&#8217;t &#8212; I&#8217;m not going to get ahead of the Department of Justice. &nbsp;We’ll let them make any decisions or announcements, but &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So they might still appeal, is what you&#8217;re saying?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; It typically &#8212; yeah, it typically takes a couple of days to review and make an assessment.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you don&#8217;t &#8212; I&#8217;m sorry, if you don&#8217;t appeal, do you run the risk of sending the message that all CDC mandates are optional?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t want &#8212; I&#8217;m not going to prejudge the Department of Justice and how they make considerations or assessments about whether or not they&#8217;re going to appeal.&nbsp; We obviously feel confident in our authorities here, given we put the mask mandate in place and asked for 15 additional days to evaluate data based on public health information.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was the administration unprepared for this ruling, given that you’re not sure what you&#8217;re going to do next?</p>



<p>And also, does the confusion around the mask mandate undercut the administration&#8217;s ability to kind of give people guidance on what is actually the right thing to do at this point?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would &#8212; I would dispute the notion that people are confused.&nbsp; We are here to alleviate their confusion, right?&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, the CDC continues to advise and recommend masks on airplanes.&nbsp; We&#8217;re abiding by the CDC recommendations, the President is.&nbsp; And we would advise all Americans to do that.</p>



<p>This was a ruling by the court.&nbsp; We obviously didn&#8217;t have advance notice of it.&nbsp; And it typically takes a couple of days to assess next steps in these cases.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And should the President be speaking &#8212; does the President have plans to speak more about this kind of evolution in how people should protect themselves from COVID, given the sense that precautions are lifting?&nbsp; You know, does he plan to speak out more in providing more guidance and leadership on this issue?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We don’t see it as an evolution.&nbsp; We continue to believe that the CDC, which asked for 15 days to evaluate health data and information based on the fact that cases were rising in certain parts of the country &#8212; that that was entirely reasonable, and that they would, at the conclusion of that period of time &#8212; not a lengthy period of time &#8212; be able to make an evaluation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He also put out a 100-page plan just a couple of weeks ago on how to deal with this moment we are in as we address the virus.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What our biggest concern is right now &#8212; continues to be the fact that we don&#8217;t have funding from Congress to ensure that we can return to a point where we have programs for the uninsured, we’re able to purchased &#8212; purchase treatments for the immunocompromised, ensuring that we continue to be the arsenal of vaccines to the world.&nbsp; Those are our biggest concerns.&nbsp; And, yes, we will speak out about that and he will speak out about that.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Russia and terrorism.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the admi- &#8212; I got one.&nbsp; I got one.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know you talked about this yesterday.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got one.&nbsp; Hold on, Jen.&nbsp; On this same issue &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Go ahead.&nbsp; Until we land we’re (inaudible).</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah, it’s my turn.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Go ahead, Jeff.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the issue of masking and your strategy in general, does the administration feel like your strategies have been thwarted by courts, in general?&nbsp;</p>



<p>And to &#8212; as a follow-up to Nancy&#8217;s question and to Jennifer&#8217;s question, if you &#8212; if you&#8217;re not challenging this, what are the next steps?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, again, if the Department of Justice makes that decision, we can talk about that.&nbsp; But they haven&#8217;t made a decision yet.&nbsp; And it typically takes a couple of days &#8212; some time to make that assessment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What was the first part of your question?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, I&#8217;m thinking about the fact that I don&#8217;t think you challenged the ruling that struck down the employer vaccine mandate.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I’m just wondering what &#8212; if you&#8217;re not going to challenge these things when they &#8212; when they get stepped out, at least in that example &#8212; we don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going to happen with this one &#8212; what&#8217;s the next step?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, we&#8217;re not going to prejudge what the Department of Justice decides.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I will say, on the employer mandate, what we did was we continued to encourage private sector companies to put in place requirements that would keep their communities safe.&nbsp; And there were a lot of big companies that had already done that &#8212; including airlines, by the way; including big hospital systems around the country &#8212; and done that effectively, efficiently without having a big drop-off of employees in their workforce.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So in this case, even as there&#8217;s not a decision yet made by the Department of Justice, we&#8217;re continuing to encourage people to wear masks in public transit.&nbsp; They&#8217;ll make that decision because it&#8217;s obviously not being implemented at this moment in time, but we&#8217;ll continue to abide by CDC guidance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If the CDC changes their assessment, which certainly at some point they will, we would follow that guidance.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Russia and terrorism.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know you talked about this a little bit yesterday, but &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; I&#8217;m &#8212; and I know you saw CNN is reporting that the U.S. is considering labeling Russia a purveyor of state-sponsored terrorism.&nbsp; Can you talk a little bit about that?&nbsp; Is that true that you are considering that?&nbsp; Tell us a little bit about how that would work out.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, let me just take a step back for a second so everybody knows how this process works, which you all may already know.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But for a country to be designated as a state sponsor of terrorism, the Secretary of State would have to determine that the government of that country has repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism.&nbsp; And only four countries have been designated to date &#8212; right? &#8212; Cuba, North Korea, Iran, and Syria.&nbsp; The designation is defined by statute, meaning Congress has written into law the exact criteria under which a state would qualify as a state sponsor of terrorism.</p>



<p>So I know my colleague over at the State Department, Ned Price, has said there &#8212; you know, there&#8217;s a lot of asks that President Zelenskyy has.&nbsp; We&#8217;re looking at a range of them.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have an update on what their process may or may not look like.&nbsp; I would point you to them to speak to that, because it&#8217;s determined by the statute from Congress, by the State Department.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, how concerned is the White House about the IMF’s prediction of seismic, you know, problems for the economy around the world due to Ukraine?&nbsp;</p>



<p>And also, just following on from that, is there a sense that if this goes on, which looks like it will in Ukraine, the fallout for other countries could eventually pressure the alliance the President has been building to, you know, basically dial back a bit even if the Ukrainians want to push on &#8212; maybe, like, try and force them into, you know, reaching a settlement that &#8212; yeah.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, okay, on the second question I would say that we&#8217;ve known from the beginning that unity doesn&#8217;t happen by accident.&nbsp; It requires a great deal of work, a great deal of diplomacy, a great deal of discussion.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s part of the reason the President had the P+11 call this morning: to continue to keep other countries updated &#8212; whether it&#8217;s NATO or the G7 or other groups of countries &#8212; on what we&#8217;re considering in terms of sanctions, what we&#8217;re considering in terms of military assistance, what other countries are doing.&nbsp; Sometimes there&#8217;s equipment the Ukrainians want we don&#8217;t have; we discuss that with them as well.</p>



<p>So that&#8217;s why there&#8217;s so much time and effort &#8212; from the President, from the Secretary of State, others &#8212; is being spent on this exactly.</p>



<p>I would say on the IMF projections: You know, I would note that the projection for the United States and our growth still continues to be higher than the vast majority of the world.&nbsp; Right?&nbsp; And that is a sign of the strength of our economy.</p>



<p>But it is true &#8212; and we&#8217;ve said this from the beginning &#8212; that the invasion of Ukraine by President Putin and Russia is going to have a continued impact on the global economy, whether it is on the oil markets or other areas. &nbsp;And certainly, that&#8217;s something we are aware of, even as the strength of our own economy &#8212; you know, we have a strong basis to build on through this difficult time.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, on the call this morning, the Pentagon has said that they&#8217;re concerned that the ammunition levels for Ukrainians are getting dangerously low.&nbsp; Was that something that the President brought up in trying to get Allies to provide more ammunition?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t &#8212; I can check on that and see if there&#8217;s anything specifically on ammunition.&nbsp; Certainly, we will continue to provide them more ammunition as we will provide them more military assistance.&nbsp; There&#8217;s obviously more money we can provide from the approved drawdown package, and the specifics of that are being worked through with the Department of Defense and our national security team.&nbsp; And that, you know, has included ammunition, and I would expect will include a range of weapons moving forward.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One more question on the mask mandate.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I understand that the judge&#8217;s ruling is something that, you know, independent judiciary has made.&nbsp; However, you saw a lot of Americans, you know, immediately pulling off their masks in airplanes, very happy about the change.&nbsp; Is the administration concerned that the public is moving on, you know, without the CDC and that the country is in a different place where the administration is in?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would note, while I&#8217;ve seen those videos, anecdotes are not data.&nbsp; Right?&nbsp; And certainly, that does tell a part of the story.&nbsp; But we don&#8217;t make these decisions based on politics or based on the political whims on a plane or even in a poll.&nbsp;<br><br>But I would note: In polls, they &#8212; and data &#8212; lengthier data &#8212; there are still a lot of people in this country who still want to have masks in place &#8212; either they have immunocompromised relatives, they have kids under five, whatever it may be.&nbsp;<br><br>So in the &#8212; even on the pure politics, I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s a concrete story at this point.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, the President is going to, you know, New Hampshire today to talk about infrastructure, selling the benefits of that.&nbsp; He said a few months ago that people didn&#8217;t want to see him being a “Senator-President” anymore.&nbsp; They want to see him getting out there, and his schedule certainly reflects that.&nbsp;<br><br>But, you know, the Chief of Staff has talked about the calendar, you know, being short and there being only so many days in the calendar to do things.&nbsp;<br><br>Is he, at some point, going to come out and talk about what he wants to see in, potentially, a skinny Build Back Better bill, given that time is of the essence with that?&nbsp;<br><br>And we haven&#8217;t heard from him really &#8212; anything about the, you know, negotiations and the talks.&nbsp; Is he going to come out and sort of put a marker down, or is the fact that he hasn&#8217;t come out and maybe won&#8217;t come out sort of a sign that maybe that&#8217;s not really going anywhere?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I would say, first, one of the decisions he also made &#8212; the President, that is &#8212; is that he wasn&#8217;t going to talk a lot publicly, because he didn&#8217;t feel it was advantageous to getting things done, about his conversations with members of all political stripes.&nbsp; And just because he&#8217;s not talking about it doesn&#8217;t mean those conversations are not happening behind the scenes.&nbsp;<br><br>And as it relates to not being a senator &#8212; or not being the “President-Senator” &#8212; I think is that &#8212; how you said it &#8212; I mean, going out in the country today and out later this week is a reflection of that.&nbsp; Going out and talking about the impacts of his policies and his agenda on the American people &#8212; in New Hampshire, out on the West Coast &#8212; that&#8217;s exactly our effort to do that and not being holed up in the Oval Office having congressional negotiations.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Should we assume that if there&#8217;s no one out there sort of talking about a new BBB bill, that there isn&#8217;t an agreement yet?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I think if we had a bill that was ready to pass with 50 votes, we would make that clear.&nbsp; So the &#8212; but there&#8217;s a range of ongoing negotiations and discussions with senators amongst themselves, a lot of them &#8212; a lot &#8212; there&#8217;s a great deal of support for moving an agenda forward that lowers costs for the American people.&nbsp;<br><br>So, not having a public speech from the President is not a reflection of what&#8217;s happening behind the scenes.&nbsp; There&#8217;s actually a strategic decision made not to have public updates about behind-the-scenes conversations.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, on Title 42, there are some Democratic senators &#8212; including Senator Hassan, Senator Peters &#8212; who have expressed concerns about what happens, what comes next after Title 42 lapses.&nbsp; And I know you said yesterday that the answer, if people want changes, is congressional legislation.</p>



<p>(Gaggle interruption.)&nbsp; (Cross-talk.)</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You good?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah, I’m good.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But it’s unlikely that, you know, Congress is going to pass something in the next few months, if at all.&nbsp; So, as an alternative to that, can you tell us anything about any plans that are underway to try to ease the transition to a post-Title 42 &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, first, I mean, the Sec- &#8212; the Home- &#8212; Department of Homeland Security and the Secretary put out a comprehensive plan for what they were going to do to prepare for any increase in influx.&nbsp; They put that out when we made an announcement about the timeline of implementation.&nbsp; And that’s something they’re having ongoing discussions with senators, members, and their teams and staff about.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, certainly, I’m sure they welcome suggestions or different things that can be done.&nbsp; But they did put out a comprehensive plan.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The issue here &#8212; the core issue is that it is being used to tie down and hold back the COVID funding.&nbsp; And our concern here is: Let’s have a conversation about immigration. &nbsp;Title 42 is not an immigration policy.&nbsp; That&#8217;s the point.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a public health authority that Congress has given the CDC authority to make a determination about.&nbsp; They made the determination.</p>



<p>So, if we want to address immigration, let&#8217;s have a conversation about that.&nbsp; But let&#8217;s not hold COVID funding hostage because we&#8217;re going to have to end a range of programs that are hurt &#8212; going to hurt the American people.&nbsp; That’s the issue.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Should we expect any new Russia sanctions this week?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; There could be, Jeff.&nbsp; I think that we&#8217;re still consid- &#8212; making &#8212; doing considerations and running a process for additional sanctions, but there are some under consideration, yes.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, can you tell us anything more about these Cuba-U.S. talks that the Cubans are saying that are happening, I think, tomorrow &#8212; is that right?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Let me get an update on that.&nbsp; I haven&#8217;t had a chance to talk to the national security team about that.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also on Ukraine, can you say how much money is left in that drawdown fund that you were talking about?&nbsp; And, obviously, both Schumer and McConnell have been talking about the need for sending more money to Ukraine.&nbsp; Is the White House open to that?&nbsp; Are there discussions about that?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; There&#8217;s an ongoing discussion with the Ukrainians about what they need, with Congress about what we can provide, and about how to &#8212; and briefings of them &#8212; to them, I should say, about how to spend the remaining drawdown funds.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which is how much?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I will check on that for you.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One question since we’re going to talk about climate in Portland and Seattle.&nbsp; Given that BBB is, you know, still &#8212; we’re not sure where the status of that is &#8212; I mean, what can you say about the &#8212; what message the President can send, given that his major climate initiatives are &#8212; they’re stalled in legislation as he’s trying to draw attention to work on climate this week?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would first say that the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law had an enormous investment in addressing the climate crisis in it, including investing in charging stations for electric vehicles across the country.&nbsp; Never has that ever been done before in that capacity.&nbsp; He has also taken a range of steps, including &#8212;</p>



<p>(Air Force One begins landing.)</p>



<p>Oh, we&#8217;re going to &#8212; okay, we got a few more &#8212; a few more seconds here.</p>



<p>&#8212; with his own authorities, including rallying automakers and auto workers around an electric transportation future; setting a national target of 50 percent electric vehicles sales by 2030; launching the EV Charging Action Plan to deploy $7.5 billion from the Bipartisan Law I mentioned; finalizing the strongest possible passenger vehicle standards in American history; issuing the U.S. Methane Emissions Restriction Action.</p>



<p>The point is: He&#8217;s not going to wait or delay taking actions to address the climate crisis.&nbsp; We&#8217;re continuing to fight for the key components that are in Build Back Better. &nbsp;But also, the Infrastructure Law that he&#8217;s already passed, signed into law, and is implementing has a major investment in climate in it.</p>



<p>Okay, we’re about to land.&nbsp; All right.&nbsp; Everybody brace for landing.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speaking of (inaudible) calendars, have you heard the President weigh in on which states he would prefer to go first in the nominating process?&nbsp; Has he talked about that at all, as far as &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; There’s a DNC process, and we trust that process to take place and move forward.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so the President hasn’t weighed in, as far as you know, on &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We’re relying on the DNC process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So he has no preference?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We’re relying on the DNC process.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Has he talked to the DNC Chairman about it at all?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don’t have any updates on private conversations.</p>



<p>Okay.&nbsp; Thanks, everyone.</p>
