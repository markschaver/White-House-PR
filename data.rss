										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>On <em>Yom HaShoah</em>, Holocaust Remembrance Day, and throughout this week of remembrance, we reflect on the horrors of the Holocaust when the Nazi regime systematically murdered 6 million Jews and millions of other innocents, including Roma, Sinti, Slavs, persons with disabilities, LGBTQI+ individuals, political dissidents, and many others.&nbsp; We stand with Jewish people in the United States, Israel, and around the world in grieving one of the darkest chapters in history.&nbsp; We honor the memories of the victims. &nbsp;We embrace the survivors. &nbsp;We commit to keeping alive the promise of &#8220;never again.&#8221;</p>



<p>The world must never forget the truth of what happened across Europe during the Holocaust or forget the horrific crimes and suffering the Nazi regime inflicted on millions of innocent people.  Entire families were wiped out.  Communities were shattered.  Survivors were left with agonizing memories and fading tattoos etched into their skin by the Nazis, reducing them to numbers.  It is forever recorded into the history of mankind, and it is the shared responsibility of us all to ensure that the <em>Shoah</em> is never erased from our collective memory &#8212; especially as fewer and fewer survivors remain.  The truth must always be known and shared with future generations in perpetuity.</p>



<p>I have taught my own children and grandchildren about the horrors of the Holocaust, just as my father taught me.  I have taken my family to bear witness to the darkness at the Dachau concentration camp so that they could understand why we must always speak out against antisemitism and hatred in all of its pernicious forms.  The legacy of the Holocaust must always remind us that silence in the face of such bigotry is complicity.</p>



<p>Remembrance is our eternal duty, but remembrance without action risks becoming an empty ritual.  As individuals, we must never be indifferent to human cruelty and human suffering.  As nations, we must stand together across the international community against antisemitism, which is once again rearing its ugly head around the world.  We must combat other forms of hatred and educate new generations about the Holocaust.  We must reject those who try to deny the Holocaust or to distort its history for their own ends.  We recognize that, just as the Holocaust was an act of pure antisemitism, so too Holocaust denial is a form of antisemitism.  We watch with dismay as the term &#8220;Nazi&#8221; is deployed to make flawed historical parallels.  Efforts to minimize, distort, or blur who the Nazis were and the genocide they perpetrated are a form of Holocaust denial and, in addition to insulting both the victims and survivors of the Holocaust, spread antisemitism.</p>



<p>My Administration has stepped up our efforts to counter all the ugly forms antisemitism can take, including Holocaust denial and distortion.  We co-sponsored a United Nations resolution that charged the international community with combating Holocaust denial through education.  We are partnering with the German government to improve Holocaust education and counter Holocaust denial and distortion.  A renowned scholar of the Holocaust and antisemitism, Deborah Lipstadt, was recently confirmed as Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Antisemitism.</p>



<p>In addition to speaking out against the evils of antisemitism, I signed &#8212; and my Administration continues to implement &#8212; legislation that gives us more tools to combat crimes that are based on a victim&#8217;s actual or perceived race, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity or disability.  We issued the first-ever National Strategy for Countering Domestic Terrorism.  My Administration has implemented increased funding for a program that helps threatened nonprofits &#8212; including houses of worship and other religious affiliated entities &#8212; to improve their safety and security.  On International Holocaust Remembrance Day, I met with Bronia Brandman and the Vice President met with Ruth Cohen &#8212; both Auschwitz survivors &#8212; at the White House so we could bear witness to their stories, combat Holocaust denial and distortion, and give life to the lessons of that most terrible period in human history.</p>



<p>Those like Bronia and Ruth who survived the Holocaust and went on to build new lives inspire our Nation and the world, and they are living testaments to the enduring resilience of the human spirit.  It is the responsibility of all of us to recognize the pain that they carry and to support them by ensuring that the cruelty of the Holocaust is never forgotten.  Today and every day, we stand against antisemitism and all other forms of hate and continue our work to ensure that everyone can live in a world that safeguards the fundamental human dignity of all people.  </p>



<p>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 24 through May 1, 2022, as a week of observance of the Days of Remembrance of Victims of the Holocaust, and call upon the people of the United States to observe this week and pause to remember victims and survivors of the Holocaust.</p>



<p>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-second day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-sixth.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-right">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>Forty years ago, the President&#8217;s Task Force on Victims of Crime was established to help those who had experienced crime and their families &#8212; an important step toward the protection of and support for victims&#8217; rights.&nbsp; Over the years, crime victims&#8217; rights have evolved.&nbsp; Dedicated professionals have worked to develop support and services for survivors that are more holistic, trauma-informed, and effective at overcoming systemic barriers that certain communities face in prosecuting offenders and obtaining justice.&nbsp; However, more work remains to be done to&nbsp;advance these goals. &nbsp;During National Crime Victims&#8217; Rights Week, our Nation renews our commitment to providing survivors of crime the support they need to heal. &nbsp;We honor the dedicated victim service providers who support crime victims, and we continue to advance this important cause for all people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Delivering true justice requires that we provide all victims with the support they need.  Persistent barriers still prevent many survivors from receiving the services they need and the justice they deserve.  Many crimes &#8212; including violent crimes, such as rape and sexual assault &#8212; often go unreported to law enforcement because, among other concerns, victims fear placing themselves in further danger and negative interactions with the criminal justice system.  My Administration is also working to tackle the epidemic of gun violence, which is a public health and public safety crisis.  In the absence of necessary Congressional action, my Administration is taking action to get illegal guns &#8212; and those who would use them to commit crimes &#8212; off of our streets. </p>



<p>Victims of crime not only face physical and emotional costs, they often suffer a serious economic toll as well, and this is another area in which my Administration is making progress.  The Crime Victims Fund, established through the Victims of Crime Act (VOCA), helps provide critical resources for victim services and victim compensation programs throughout the country.  That is why, last July, I signed the VOCA Fix to Sustain the Crime Victim Fund Act into law to strengthen VOCA and increase the revenues to support survivors of crime and victim services organizations.  My Administration is supporting innovative programs like sexual assault telehealth services and hospital-based victim assistance, enabling providers to quickly reach more survivors and reduce repeated victimization.  I am also proud to have recently signed into law the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), which funds programs that provide services to survivors of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking.  This reauthorization of VAWA also expands the rights of victims of technology-facilitated gender-based violence and also includes historic Tribal provisions to protect Native communities and help them pursue justice. </p>



<p>Strengthening public safety also means addressing the trauma and inequality of victimization experienced by communities of color, Native American communities, the LGBTQI+ community, the Asian American community, and other historically marginalized groups.  People of color suffer higher rates of victimization, and violence is disproportionally concentrated in neighborhoods that have been harmed persistently by racial discrimination, segregation, redlining, and disinvestment.  Breaking the cycle of violence enhances public safety, public health, and equity.  We also know that members of the LGBTQI+ community are more likely to be victims of violent crime.  </p>



<p>My Administration is committed to using all tools at our disposal to ensure every survivor of crime has equal access to the resources and services they need to recover from their ordeals and regain a feeling of safety.  To address a surge in hate crimes and bias-motivated attacks &#8212; and to provide law enforcement with the resources to identify and investigate hate crimes, I signed the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act into law.  As part of this law, we have funded a new Center for Culturally Responsive Victim Services to help local programs better serve historically marginalized communities.  </p>



<p> In addition to supporting crime victims, we must also hold offenders accountable.  That is why the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security are committed to investigating and enforcing our criminal and civil laws and ensuring that Federal, State, local, territorial, and Tribal law enforcement officers and prosecutors receive the training and resources they need to deliver justice to victims.</p>



<p> It takes enormous courage and extraordinary strength to emerge from life&#8217;s most painful moments.  As a Nation, let us all work together to stop crimes before they happen and to give victims the support they need to restore a sense of trust and safety and to move toward healing and justice.</p>



<p>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 24 through April 30, 2022, National Crime Victims&#8217; Rights Week.  I call upon all Americans to observe this week by participating in events that raise awareness of victims&#8217; rights and services and by volunteering to serve victims in their time of need.</p>



<p>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-second day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-sixth.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-right">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>On April 22, a high-level U.S. delegation – led by National Security Council Indo-Pacific Coordinator Kurt Campbell, Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Daniel Kritenbrink, Deputy Commander INDOPACOM&nbsp;Lieutenant General&nbsp;Stephen Sklenka , and USAID Acting Senior Deputy Assistant Administrator for Asia Craig Hart – visited Honiara, Solomon Islands. The delegation met for ninety minutes with Prime Minister&nbsp;Manasseh&nbsp;Sogavare, along with two dozen members of his cabinet and senior staff. While there, the delegation also met with prominent religious leaders on the island and with key members of the political opposition.</p>



<p>This visit to&nbsp;Solomon Islands was the final leg of the delegation’s trip across the Pacific. It followed stops in Hawaii, where the delegation met with senior officials from Australia,&nbsp;Japan,&nbsp;and New Zealand; Fiji, where they met with Prime Minister&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;Bainimarama, as well as&nbsp;leadership of the Pacific Island Forum, and held the&nbsp;U.S.-Fiji Strategic Dialogue; and Papua New Guinea, where they met with Prime Minister James Marape and senior defense officials to discuss ways to enhance security ties. Across these engagements, the United States reiterated that it will seek to further deepen our enduring ties with&nbsp;the Pacific Islands&nbsp;and take tangible&nbsp;steps to advance a free, open, and resilient Indo-Pacific. The United States will do so by fulfilling and strengthening its commitments in the region, working to advance regional unity, coordinating with allies and partners on meeting twenty-first century challenges, and protecting the sovereignty of Pacific Island states.</p>



<p>In the meeting with Solomon Islands’ Prime Minister Sogavare, the delegation reiterated the key priorities animating the trip and also outlined specific steps&nbsp;the United States&nbsp;would take to advance the welfare of the people of&nbsp;Solomon Islands. The United States will expedite the opening of an embassy in&nbsp;Solomon Islands; advance cooperation on unexploded ordinance; launch a program on maritime domain awareness; dispatch the Mercy hospital ship to address public health; advance a dialogue on the return of the Peace Corps; deliver additional vaccines;&nbsp;and advance initiatives on&nbsp;climate, health,&nbsp;and people-to-people ties.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The United States respects the right of nations to make sovereign decisions in the best interests of their people. The two sides engaged in substantial discussion around the recently&nbsp;signed&nbsp;security agreement between&nbsp;Solomon Islands and the People’s Republic of China (PRC). Solomon Islands representatives indicated that the agreement had solely domestic applications, but the&nbsp;U.S. delegation noted&nbsp;there are potential regional security implications of the accord, including for the United States and its allies and partners. The U.S. delegation outlined clear areas of concern with respect to the purpose, scope, and transparency of the agreement.</p>



<p>If steps are taken to establish a de facto permanent military presence, power-projection capabilities, or a military installation, the delegation noted that the United States would then have significant concerns and respond accordingly. In response to these enumerated concerns, Prime Minister Sogavare reiterated his specific assurances that there would be no military base, no long-term presence, and no power projection capability, as he has said publicly. The United States emphasized that it will follow developments closely in consultation with regional partners.</p>



<p>At this critical juncture, the United States and Solomon Islands agreed to launch a high-level strategic dialogue, co-chaired on the U.S. side by the White House and the Department of State. Its purpose will be to enhance communication, address mutual concerns, and drive practical progress. In particular, both sides agreed to discuss in greater detail security issues of mutual concern, economic and social development, public health, and finance and debt. Each side committed to take the necessary steps in the intervening period to prepare for a successful engagement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>New actions will protect against wildfire threats, support local economies, and reduce climate pollution</em></p>



<p>Today, on Earth Day, President Biden will sign an Executive Order to expand his Administration’s historic and bold efforts to tackle the climate crisis, make our nation more resilient to extreme weather, and strengthen local economies. The President will sign the Executive Order in Seattle, Washington—rounding out a trip across the West focused on lowering costs for families and protecting communities from intensifying climate impacts. Wildfires and extreme weather events are growing in frequency and ferocity, engulfing communities in the West and across the country and costing lives, homes, and money. Because President Biden knows the cost of inaction is too great, he is taking bold executive action and reaffirming his calls on Congress to address the climate crisis. &nbsp;</p>



<p>America’s forests are a key climate solution, absorbing carbon dioxide equivalent to more than 10% of U.S. annual greenhouse gas emissions. Federal lands are home to many of the nation’s mature and old-growth forests, which serve as critical carbon sinks, cherished landscapes, and unique habitats. However, these magnificent ecosystems are threatened by the climate impacts that are already here, with intensifying wildfires demanding urgent action to protect our forests and the economies that depend on them. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provides historic wildfire resilience funding and calls for prioritizing the restoration of old-growth forests.</p>



<p>Building on this directive and the Administration’s commitment to climate-smart forest stewardship, today’s Executive Order will:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Safeguard mature and old-growth forests on federal lands</strong>, as part of a science-based approach to reduce wildfire risk.</li><li><strong>Strengthen reforestation partnerships across the country</strong> to support local economies and ensure we retain forest ecosystems and sustainable supplies of forest products for years to come.</li><li><strong>Combat global deforestation</strong> to deliver on key COP26 commitments.</li><li><strong>Enlist nature to address the climate crisis</strong> with comprehensive efforts to deploy nature-based solutions that reduce emissions and build resilience.</li></ul>



<p>Across these efforts, the Administration will leverage historic investments from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the FY 2022 budget, and work in partnership with states, Tribal Nations, communities, industry, NGOs, labor, scientists, and private landowners, to strengthen our forests while creating good-paying jobs.</p>



<p>Today’s Executive Order will advance the Biden-Harris Administration’s climate goals and economic agenda by:</p>



<p><strong><u>Reducing Wildfire Risk</u></strong></p>



<p>Under President Biden’s leadership, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Forest Service has developed a <a href="https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2022/01/18/secretary-vilsack-announces-new-10-year-strategy-confront-wildfire">10-year strategy</a> to reduce wildfire risk through science-based fuels and forest health treatments, with a goal of treating an additional 50 million acres across federal and non-federal lands. The Department of the Interior (DOI) has also developed a <a href="https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/interior-department-releases-five-year-monitoring-maintenance-and-treatment-plan">5-year plan</a> for monitoring, maintenance, and treatment efforts focused on fire-prone Interior and Tribal lands.</p>



<p>As a critical down payment, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provides $8 billion to fund forest and land management activities, and the FY 2022 Omnibus provides $5.7 billion for wildland fire management and related risk mitigation and research. USDA and DOI are mobilizing $5 billion from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law for hazardous fuels reduction and other mitigation programs, such as a $1 billion Community Wildfire Defense Grant program and $600 million for firefighter pay—providing about 1,500 additional firefighters and supporting the President’s commitment that no federal firefighter will make less than $15 an hour. Already, USDA has <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/news/releases/biden-administration-announces-bipartisan-infrastructure-law-wildfire-mitigation">announced</a> $131 million this year for wildfire risk reduction treatments in high-risk landscapes in Washington, Oregon, California, Idaho, Montana, Colorado, New Mexico, and Arizona.</p>



<p>The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law directs DOI and USDA to specifically prioritize the restoration of old-growth forests, taking into consideration their contributions to landscape fire adaptation. However, there is currently no inventory that identifies the location and condition of mature and old-growth stands.</p>



<p><strong><em>To strengthen America’s forests and advance a holistic, science-based approach to wildfire resilience and forest restoration, this Executive Order advances action on: &nbsp;</em></strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>Data Collection and Analysis:</strong> DOI and USDA will conduct the first-ever inventory of mature and old-growth forests on federal lands. This will be completed and made publicly available in a year and will establish consistent definitions, accounting for regional and ecological variation. The agencies will then analyze threats facing these forests, including from wildfires and other climate impacts.</li><li><strong>Climate-Smart Stewardship:</strong> After completing the inventory, DOI and USDA will develop new policies, with robust opportunity for public comment, to institutionalize climate-smart management and conservation strategies that address the threats facing mature and old-growth forests on federal lands.</li><li><strong>Enhanced Coordination: </strong>DOI and USDA will partner with other federal agencies, states, Tribal Nations, and any interested private landowners to better coordinate conservation and wildfire risk reduction efforts—leveraging investments from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and other sources.</li></ul>



<p>Going forward, the Administration will work with Congress to secure additional resources, by requesting $6.1 billion for wildfire risk reduction in the President’s FY 2023 Budget and continuing to pursue historic climate resilience investments in additional legislation.</p>



<p><strong><u>Strengthening Forests for Thriving Local Economies</u></strong></p>



<p>America’s forests provide millions of jobs and underpin local economies, particularly in rural communities. The Biden-Harris Administration is mobilizing historic resources to help these forests and communities thrive. For example, the Administration’s Building a Better America Rural Infrastructure Tour is <a href="https://www.usda.gov/sites/default/files/documents/usda-rural-fact-sheet.pdf">highlighting</a> wide-ranging support for healthy forest economies, including: planning assistance to boost outdoor recreation economies; support for Tribes, local governments, and conservation non-profits to establish community forests that create jobs; and grants to expand markets for innovative wood products and wood energy that support sustainable forest management.</p>



<p>Through the FY 2022 Omnibus, the Administration is also investing $162 million in cooperative forestry programs across State, municipal, and privately-owned forest landscapes. Additionally, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law significantly expands reforestation projects on National Forest land—enough to plant an estimated 1.2 billion trees and sequester 75 million metric tons of carbon, all while supporting thousands of jobs.</p>



<p><strong><em>The Executive Order will build on these efforts by advancing:</em></strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>Economic Opportunities in Outdoor Recreation and Sustainable Forest Products: </strong>The Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, and the Interior will work with state, local, Tribal, and territorial governments, as well as the private sector, nonprofit organizations, labor unions, and the scientific community, to advance forest-related economic opportunities at the local and regional levels. These community-led opportunities will create and sustain jobs in outdoor recreation and in sustainable wood, paper, and other forest products, while supporting healthy, sustainably managed forests in timber communities.<br><br></li><li><strong>Reforestation Partnerships: </strong>The Administration will develop agency-specific 2030 targets for reforestation, including the use of partnerships to advance these goals beyond federal lands to enable our future forests to be more resilient to climate change and wildfire, while also supporting healthy forest economies for years to come.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Expanding Seed and Nursery Capacity:</strong><a> </a>USDA and DOI will address a longstanding seed shortfall by developing a plan, in partnership with states, Tribes, and the private sector, to boost federal cone and seed collection and seedling nursery capacity. These actions will support tree-planting efforts by a range of public and private partners. Expanding seed and nursery capacity is especially important for timberlands in the West that have been devastated by wildfire and need to be re-planted.</li></ul>



<p><strong><u>Combatting Global Deforestation</u></strong></p>



<p>President Biden has committed to help deliver on global goals to end natural forest loss by 2030, while restoring at least an additional 200 million hectares of forests and other ecosystems. At the COP26 international climate conference, President Biden announced the “<a href="https://www.state.gov/plan-to-conserve-global-forests-critical-carbon-sinks/">Plan to Conserve Global Forests: Critical Carbon Sinks</a>”—harnessing U.S. diplomatic, policy, and financing tools, in partnership with other countries, Indigenous and local forest communities, the private sector, and civil society, and with a focus on three critical areas of global importance: the Amazon, Congo, and Southeast Asian forests.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>To further advance these efforts and achieve the President’s international commitments, this Executive Order directs the Department of State, in coordination with other agencies, to prepare reports to the President on whole-of-government approaches to stopping global deforestation and restoring lands, including:</em></strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>Combat Commodity-Driven Deforestation:</strong> A major driver of global deforestation is forest clearing to produce agricultural commodities like beef, soy, and palm oil. To combat those practices, the Department of State will lead development of a report on whole-of-government approaches to reduce or eliminate U.S. purchases of agricultural commodities grown on illegally or recently deforested lands, including through public-private partnerships to incentivize sustainable sourcing. These efforts will not only protect forests and human rights abroad, but also provide a level playing field for responsible agricultural producers at home.</li><li><strong>Support Sustainable Forest Management Around the World:</strong> The Department of State will coordinate with other agencies to assess the broader use of foreign assistance, trade tools, finance, and international partnerships to combat deforestation and support sustainable forest management around the world, with special attention to the critical role played by Indigenous peoples and local communities and landholders in conserving and restoring forests.</li></ul>



<p><strong><u>Enlisting Nature in the Fight Against Climate Change</u></strong></p>



<p>The Biden-Harris Administration has led the way on enhancing nature’s ability to support the health, wellbeing, and economic security of all Americans. President Biden launched the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/12/20/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-celebrates-expansion-of-locally-led-conservation-efforts-in-first-year-of-america-the-beautiful-initiative/">America the Beautiful initiative</a> to support his goal of conserving at least 30 percent of U.S. lands and waters by 2030. Interagency Working Groups reporting to the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/climate/">National Climate Task Force</a> are exploring nature-based solutions to address extreme heat, drought, wildfire, flood, and coastal threats. The Administration is also recognizing the value of and elevating <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/news-updates/2021/11/15/white-house-commits-to-elevating-indigenous-knowledge-in-federal-policy-decisions/">Indigenous Traditional Ecological Knowledge</a> across federal scientific and policy processes. The President’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provides—as part of over $50 billion in historic resilience investments—funding for nature-based solutions, including $2.3 billion for the Forest Service and Interior to advance ecosystem restoration and resilience.</p>



<p>To facilitate use of these and other resources, today the National Climate Task Force’s<a href="https://www.noaa.gov/coastal-resilience-interagency-working-group"> Coastal Resilience Interagency Working Group</a>, co-led by the White House Council on Environmental Quality and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, is releasing a <strong><a href="https://www.noaa.gov/sites/default/files/2022-04/Nature-based-Solutions-Compendium.pdf">Compendium of Federal Nature-Based Solutions for Coastal Communities, States, Tribes, and Territories</a></strong>—streamlining access to more than 100 information resources and 48 federal programs that can support nature-based solutions in coastal areas.  </p>



<p><strong><em>To further amplify the power of nature, including its ability to absorb climate pollution and increase resilience in all communities, today’s Executive Order calls for the following:<br></em></strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>Report on Nature-Based Solutions:</strong> As reaffirmed this year by the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/news-updates/2022/02/28/statements-from-the-white-house-office-on-science-and-technology-policy-ostp-on-the-intergovernmental-panel-on-climate-changes-working-group-ii-report/">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a>, nature-based solutions will play a key role in achieving net-zero emissions and building resilience to climate impacts. Building on ongoing efforts, the White House Council on Environmental Quality, Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), and Office of Domestic Climate Policy will work with agencies to develop a report to the National Climate Task Force on key opportunities for greater deployment of nature-based solutions—everything from restoring marshes, to planting shade trees, to promoting drought-resistant crops.</li><li><strong>Guidance on Valuing Nature: </strong>The Office of Management and Budget will issue valuation guidance to help agencies better account for services provided by ecosystems and the environment (such as pollinators supporting our crops, or forests cleaning our air and water). In support, OSTP and the Department of Commerce will continue leading an interagency initiative to improve and update baseline information on the economic value of our existing natural assets and new nature-based solutions.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>First U.S. National Nature Assessment:</strong> The United States lacks comprehensive knowledge of the state of our nation’s lands, waters, and wildlife and the specific benefits that they provide. To create this comprehensive picture, the 13-agency U.S. Global Change Research Program will develop the first-ever assessment of the condition of nature within the United States. The assessment will also allow us to look ahead at how nature might change in the future and identify opportunities for investments in nature to help achieve our climate, health, environmental justice, and economic goals.</li></ul>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>UCSF Mission Bay Medical Center<br><em>San Francisco, California</em></em></p>



<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT: But I&#8217;m so looking forward to our conversations. But you all just have to know, we applaud and thank you. We are so grateful for what you all do. And you know, we were just talking about it &#8212; it takes a lot to do the work that that you all do, and it can be quite painful because you see so much pain and you care so deeply.<br><br>And in spite of all of that, you all are about empowerment, about recognizing &#8212; not giving but recognizing the dignity and fighting for the rights.<br><br>And it&#8217;s extraordinary the gift that you have and that you give. And so, I wanted to come here today &#8212; and with the Administrator &#8212; so we could talk with you, we can visit with you so we can talk about you as we travel around the country.<br><br>Because, you know, we were talking earlier about it. When we&#8217;re fighting for the ability of women and their families and their community to receive all that they are entitled to receive, it&#8217;s important that we also let them know that they are not alone. And that&#8217;s part of telling the stories.<br><br>It is also about letting them know and see what the solution looks like so that they don&#8217;t have to ever have an experience of wondering whether it is even possible that they would be treated with dignity and receive what is necessary for them to have a joyful and healthy experience and be seen in the full totality of who they are.<br><br>So, by being here today and lifting up and sharing what you all are doing here, we&#8217;re going to be talking with women you all will never meet, will probably never even know your names or mine, but who will benefit from what you all are doing here on the ground. So, I just want to thank you all so very much.<br><br>And with that, why don’t we begin our conversation.<br><br>END</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Private Residence<br>Seattle, Washington</p>



<p>6:29 P.M. PDT</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; First of all, every time I’m here, I don&#8217;t want to go home, Jay.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; My Lord.&nbsp; Look, first of all, Mary, Spencer, and Brad and Kathy, thank you.&nbsp; Thank you for hosting me.&nbsp; And almost every one of you has &#8212; or part of the reason why I&#8217;m standing here in the first place as the President of the United States &#8212; you&#8217;ve all been an enormous help.</p>



<p>And the thing I want to mention is that, in all the help you give me, not one of you have ever called and asked for a favor.&nbsp; I mean that sincerely.&nbsp; Think about that.&nbsp; Not one of you have ever called and said, “Now you’re President.&nbsp; Can I get boom, boom, boom?”&nbsp; Not one.</p>



<p>And the way you do it with such honor, integrity.&nbsp; And so many of the philanthropies that some of you run &#8212; always doing this good, decent work for people.</p>



<p>You know, when I ran, I was &#8212; I won’t say “criticized” &#8212; people thought I wasn&#8217;t &#8212; my rationale for running was not one that would carry much weight in terms of the body politic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I said I was running for three reasons.&nbsp; One, to restore the soul of the country and to restore a sense of decency and honor to the &#8212; to the United States of America in terms of the presidency.&nbsp; Because the president and the White House was looked at by many people around the world as what America is about.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not; it&#8217;s much bigger &#8212; bigger &#8212; bigger than that.</p>



<p>But &#8212; and the second thing I said was that I wanted to rebuild the economy &#8212; the backbone of the economy, which I believe to be the middle class.&nbsp; Because if the middle class does well, the poor have a way up and the wealthy still do very well.&nbsp; Everybody does better when everybody is in on the deal.</p>



<p>And the third thing was &#8212; that’s turning &#8212; that I was roundly and justifiably criticized for was saying I want to unite the country.&nbsp; Because no democracy can be sustained without the informed consent of the American people.&nbsp; We’ve got to bring them together.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a tough thing.</p>



<p>And so, one of the things that I found is that I’m reminded every day why elections matter.&nbsp; And I just cite two generic examples of why I say that.&nbsp; Number one &#8212; and the press has heard me say this, so I apologize to the press for my repeating this, but I believe it &#8212; is that, Gov, I think, in the year 2020 and beyond, we&#8217;re in the battle between democracies and autocracies.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve had long discussions and over many, many hours &#8212; I mean, literally, over &#8212; I think it&#8217;s now up to 70-some hours with Xi Jinping.&nbsp; We traveled 17,000 miles.&nbsp; And he doesn’t have a democratic &#8212; with a small “d” &#8212; bone in his body.&nbsp; He’s a very smart and calculating guy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And he&#8217;s just very straightforward with me.&nbsp; He doesn&#8217;t think that democracies can be sustained in the 21st century, in the second quarter of the century, because things are moving so rapidly, so incredibly fast that only &#8212; he doesn&#8217;t say “autocracy” &#8212; only autocracies are able to handle it.&nbsp; Because democracies require consensus, and it takes too much time, too much effort to get it together.&nbsp; And by that time, the event, the circumstance has gone beyond your ability to fix it.</p>



<p>And we see that &#8212; I &#8212; we talked about it.&nbsp; We mentioned democracies.&nbsp; One of the things that I did, I put together a worldwide effort, through a Zoom conference, with 142 heads of state on gathering up the democracies of the world to discuss where we go from here.&nbsp; And this was now two and a half months ago.</p>



<p>And as Freedom House will tell you, we have fewer democracies today than we did 15 years ago.&nbsp; Democracies are actually receding, not expanding.&nbsp; Just look around the world.&nbsp; Things are changing.</p>



<p>And so, when I got elected, one of the things I thought was critic- &#8212; critically important was that we stopped treating our allies and friends &#8212; my first discussion, Xi Jinping called me the night I was elected and the day after my &#8212;&nbsp; election &#8212; the next day after my election in 20- &#8212; whatever date it was.&nbsp; I can’t remember now.&nbsp; (Laughter.)</p>



<p>But all kidding aside, he called me to congratulate me.&nbsp; We ended up spending almost three hours on the telephone.&nbsp; And he &#8212; and it just amazed the Chinese experts who were on the phone with me, the things that he said.&nbsp; He remembered everything I had said to him.&nbsp; He said, “I remember you &#8212; asking you.”&nbsp; I said, “I know.”&nbsp; He said, “You shouldn&#8217;t be criticizing another country in terms of your &#8212; our human rights and our policy towards individuals.”</p>



<p>And I said, “You know, the United States is the most unique the country in the world not because we were born that way, but because we&#8217;re the only country ever organized based on an idea.”</p>



<p>I mean that sincerely.&nbsp; Think about it.&nbsp; An idea.&nbsp; We’re not based on ethnicity, race, religion, geography.&nbsp; It’s an idea. And what was the idea?&nbsp; “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all women and men are created equal, endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights.”&nbsp; You know it.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve never met it, but we never walked away from it.&nbsp; We’ve never walked away from, except for a very brief period of time in the last administration.</p>



<p>And so, I said, “For me not to be critical of your abuse of human rights would be like you deciding you didn&#8217;t think that China was any longer the center of the earth.&nbsp; You would be abandoning exactly what your country thinks it is and thought it was.”&nbsp; And I said, “So, I&#8217;m not going to stop being critical.”</p>



<p>My generic point was larger, though.&nbsp; If you &#8212; I said I was going to &#8212; he said, “What are you going to do?”&nbsp; And I said, “What I&#8217;m going to do is reestablish our alliances.”&nbsp; And by my implication, he said, “That&#8217;s &#8212; that’s because you&#8217;re trying to hurt China.”</p>



<p>I said, “No.&nbsp; It&#8217;s because we have to bring together the alliances we had before that have been treated like &#8212; our alliances, four years earlier, had been treated like…” &#8212; how can I say it?&nbsp; Anyway.&nbsp; Not well.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; I was going to say something I shouldn’t say (inaudible).</p>



<p>But all kidding aside, think about it.&nbsp; And so, what I did was, I immediately convened a meeting and &#8212; of the G7.&nbsp; And it was in London.&nbsp; I mean, excuse me, in suburban &#8212; it was down in the (inaudible) in England.</p>



<p>And everybody showed up.&nbsp; And the first thing I said, when I walked in, I said, “America is back.”&nbsp; And I will not, with the press here, say &#8212; went &#8212; two heads of state said the same thing: “For how long?&nbsp; For how long?”</p>



<p>And I also indicated to Xi Jinping that I was going to pull together the Quad: Australia, India, Japan, and the United States.&nbsp; He said, “You&#8217;re just doing that to affect us.”</p>



<p>I said, “No, it&#8217;s because we&#8217;re trying to put together those folks who have an opportunity to work together in the Indo-Pacific.”</p>



<p>The point being that one of the things that the autocrats fear the most &#8212; and India has its own problems; all those countries have their own problems &#8212; is the notion that somehow we can work together in concert and &#8212; contrary to what are essentially dictatorships, which a lot of countries have become &#8212; particularly, not only China, but Russia and many other countries &#8212; the Philippines.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so, the point I&#8217;m making is that I spend a lot of time and put together, I think, a pretty good foreign policy team &#8212; with our Secretary of Defense, Secretary of State, National Security Advisor, et cetera &#8212; and reached out.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And what happened was: Putin thought, when we got elected, that we’d &#8212; he’d easily be able to break up NATO.&nbsp; That&#8217;s what part of his objective was from the very beginning.&nbsp; And I know I&#8217;ve been saying that for eight years, but it was part of his objective.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the irony of all ironies to this &#8212; and you know from being the Ambassador to Switzerland &#8212; what happened was: He got exactly what he didn&#8217;t want.&nbsp; He was looking for the further Finlandization of Europe.&nbsp; Instead, he got Finland and the President of &#8212; the President of Finland calling, wanting to see me, wanting to join NATO, and Sweden wanting to join NATO.&nbsp; His action is generating exactly the opposite of what he intended.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I&#8217;m not suggesting that that makes things all that easier.&nbsp; But the point is that we have a circumstance where the Ukrainian people are incredibly brave; they’re incredibly resolved &#8212; not just the military that was trained, but the American &#8212; but the people in the streets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And he is making &#8212; they&#8217;re making a lie of Putin’s theory that somehow because they&#8217;re Slavic in background and spoke &#8212; many spoke Russian that somehow there would be a welcoming party.&nbsp; The exact opposite has happened.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The reason I bother to raise this is that it raises the issue of whether or not &#8212; what our foreign policy will be from this point on.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s occupied, Jay more of my time than I ever anticipated it would be.</p>



<p>And that, coupled with COVID, has had a phenomenal negative impact on things that relate to, basically, inflation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The &#8212; when you find ourselves in a situation where in &#8212; because of COVID, there&#8217;s a factory in &#8212; the factory in Vietnam or in Taiwan closes down &#8212; that was the reason why one third of all the inflation last year was the price of automobiles.&nbsp; They couldn&#8217;t get &#8212; they couldn&#8217;t get the computer chips to be able to build the automobiles.</p>



<p>We’re now in a situation where because of Russia being such a major oil producer and because Ukraine and Russia were the wheat and corn breadbaskets of the world, we see everything from the price of eggs to the price of gasoline go up.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I come from a family &#8212; not a joke &#8212; where when the price of a gallon of gasoline went up, it was a conversation at our kitchen table.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And a lot of people, notwithstanding the fact that we&#8217;ve created more jobs in the first 14 months than any President in the history.&nbsp; We have provided 400- &#8212; 5- &#8212; we created 420,000 manufacturing jobs that people thought were dead in America.&nbsp; We made &#8212; brought the employment &#8212; employment rate down to 3.6 percent from over 6 percent.&nbsp; Notwithstanding all that &#8212; and wages going up &#8212; people are concerned, uncertain, and angry.&nbsp; They&#8217;re angry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They don&#8217;t know quite what to do because, again, when gasoline goes over $4 a gallon, it&#8217;s a big deal in an awful lot of households &#8212; the vast majority of households.&nbsp; When the cost of a dozen eggs goes up.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I mean, so the two things we&#8217;ve worked on as hard as we could is dealing with the supply chains so that we&#8217;re able to &#8212; we&#8217;re able &#8212; you know, there&#8217;s a law that&#8217;s been on the books since the ‘30s and it’s the “Buy America” law.&nbsp; It’s not a violation of any international group.&nbsp; As President United States these days, I get to spend and decide where we spend about $6- to $700 billion of your money.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so, under the law, we&#8217;re able to insist that I can only buy &#8212; I can insist that we buy American and that the vehicles that I&#8217;m &#8212; the &#8212; whatever I&#8217;m purchasing is up to 100 percent made in America &#8212; all the &#8212; all the parts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so, Buy American was viewed to be 51 percent.&nbsp; That was enough.&nbsp; Well, that&#8217;s 51 percent of American product.&nbsp; It&#8217;s now 75.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But my generic point is this: We have not invested in ourselves in America &#8212; the government has not invested in America either in our education and in our &#8212; in our technology.&nbsp; We used to provide &#8212; and now you all are doing it &#8212; but we used to provide from the government &#8212; 2 percent of our GDP was invested in research and development.&nbsp; It’s less than 1 percent now.&nbsp; Less than 1 percent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We used to be in a situation where we had the best infrastructure in the world &#8212; our ports, airports &#8212; or just go down the road &#8212; high- &#8212; the whole deal.&nbsp; We now rank 13th in the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We used to be in a situation where &#8212; if you think about it, why were we the most powerful nation in the world, beginning &#8212; in the beginning of the 21st century &#8212; the 20th century?&nbsp; Because the only nation in the world that had universal education from K through 12.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other people &#8212; they had great education systems for the elite in &#8212; throughout Europe and great universities and great, great what we would call “high school.”&nbsp; But it wasn&#8217;t universal.&nbsp; The rest of the world has caught up with us and what have we done?&nbsp; Does anybody think if, today, we said, “We&#8217;re going to have a national education system,” that we&#8217;d say 12 years is enough?&nbsp; Anybody think 12 years is enough in the 21st century &#8212; in the second quarter of the 21st century?&nbsp; What are we doing?&nbsp; We&#8217;re resisting what we know to be the case.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If in fact &#8212; all the studies have shown from the great universities of the last 10 years, if you have mandatory schooling &#8212; or schooling available for pre-K &#8212; three-, four-, and five-year-olds &#8212; you increase by over 56 percent that the child, no matter what the background they come from, is going to be able to get through 12 years of school &#8212; 12 years of schooling and go beyond.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You know, you all know the studies because you’re &#8212; the philanthropies you run, you&#8217;ve been involved in helping.&nbsp; You all know that, for example, a child coming from a broken home &#8212; with a mom or a dad or &#8212; where there&#8217;s a drug problem or there&#8217;s just pure poverty &#8212; that child, by the time they go to kindergarten, will have heard 1 million fewer words spoken than a child from an average middle-class home.&nbsp; Not different words, just spoken.&nbsp; Just spoken.</p>



<p>And we&#8217;re in a situation where we find now, if in fact you have a circumstance where there is three- and four- and five-year-olds in school &#8212; school, not daycare &#8212; school, where they’re learning to read, write, add, and subtract, they increase exponentially their ability to learn.&nbsp; And they don&#8217;t show up &#8212; it doesn&#8217;t matter what their background they come from.&nbsp; It doesn’t matter what the background they come from.</p>



<p>Many of you know better than I &#8212; my son-in-law, who has his doctorate in neuroscience and is a reconstructive plastic surgeon in Philadelphia, talks about it.&nbsp; The brain has been rapidly advancing during that period of time.&nbsp; And it continues to grow after age 20.&nbsp; But what do we do?</p>



<p>So, for very little money, I spoke to the Fortune 500 companies, I spoke to the &#8212; actually the &#8212; when I &#8212; in Washington, we had &#8212; finally were able to gather up a larger number of people, and I spoke to the national Chamber of Commerce.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I pointed out that, when I was Vice President, President Obama asked me to deal with the Recovery Act, which was several billion dollars, and to get it working.</p>



<p>And I said one things I did was I went with the Secretary of Commerce and others to speak to a 300 &#8212; I think it was 340-some or 350 &#8212; I don&#8217;t remember the number &#8212; of the CEOs in the Fortune 500 companies.&nbsp; And I asked what they most needed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It will not surprise you what the answer was: a better-educated workforce.&nbsp; But guess what?&nbsp; The notable exceptions in this room: You all don&#8217;t pay for the better-educated workforce you have.</p>



<p>When I got elected in 1973, the DuPont &#8212; “the state of DuPont,” as I used to kid &#8212; DuPont was the eighth-largest corporation in the world, and they educated their newly hired people for the jobs they had.&nbsp; They took the time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That doesn’t happen now.&nbsp; So, I raised the question.&nbsp; I said, “Why…” &#8212; this was the national Chamber &#8212; “why are you opposed to preschool being…”&nbsp; And they all said, “I never thought of it.&nbsp; We’re not.&nbsp; We’re not.”</p>



<p>There are so many things we can do without raising taxes on &#8212; and, by the way, all of the stuff &#8212; we&#8217;ve had expensive programs: the Recovery Act, plus the infrastructure bill.&nbsp; Guess what?&nbsp; We’ve actually reduced the federal debt by $350 billion in 2021.&nbsp; And it’s projected now to be reduced by $1.3 trillion with all the growth we&#8217;re talking about.&nbsp; That’s a fact.</p>



<p>Whether we do the $1.3 trillion, we&#8217;ll see at the end of the year.&nbsp; The largest number ever in American history.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; But my generic point is &#8212; it’s not some &#8212; what I&#8217;m trying to say is, there&#8217;s so many things we can do that don&#8217;t punish anybody and get so much done.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m a capitalist.&nbsp; I think you should be able to make a million, a billion dollars.&nbsp; Not a joke.&nbsp; Whatever you can make.&nbsp; But you&#8217;re the prime example of what I&#8217;m about to say because you do it.&nbsp; Everybody has to pay a piece of &#8212; a fair share.&nbsp; The idea &#8212; the idea that we have a system now where it&#8217;s so disproportionately unbalanced &#8212; without &#8212; it won&#8217;t hurt anybody.&nbsp; No big deal &#8212; to pay for what we need.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, healthcare.&nbsp; You know, I know some of you have &#8212; I hope you have interest in some of the major drug companies in the country.&nbsp; And guess what?&nbsp; The insulin &#8212; how many people have Stage 1 diabetes?&nbsp; Thousands of people, two hundred thousand kids in America.&nbsp; The average cost on a monthly basis: $641; as high as $1,000, as low in some places as $95.</p>



<p>But here&#8217;s the deal: It cost 10 bucks to develop, at the time, that insulin vial.&nbsp; Ten dollars.&nbsp; I think we should see to it that &#8212; that unless there&#8217;s new research and development put into it to change the formulas that you can&#8217;t charge more than $35.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Imagine being the parent of a kid with Type 1 diabetes, knowing, if they go into insulin shock, what the danger is, sitting there knowing you don’t have the insurance or the wherewithal to pay for it.&nbsp; Not only is your kid in trouble &#8212; you&#8217;re stripped of your dignity.&nbsp; Everything is taken from you.</p>



<p>But what&#8217;s the big fight?&nbsp; I can&#8217;t get a single Republican to say, “That&#8217;s a good idea.”&nbsp; Everybody points out what I have is I have one Democrat that says “no.”&nbsp; Well, that&#8217;s true.&nbsp; But guess what?&nbsp; Forty-eight of the fifty Democrats in the Senate vote with me 95 percent of the time, or over 90 percent of the time.</p>



<p>But the second point I want to make: This is not your father&#8217;s Republican Party.  This is a different deal.  Not a joke.  Not a joke.  And it&#8217;s not just Trump, it&#8217;s the MAGA crowd.  It’s all about things that have nothing to do with traditional, conservative doctrine. </p>



<p>I respect conservatives.&nbsp; There&#8217;s nothing conservative about deciding you&#8217;re going to throw Disney out of its present posture because &#8212; Mickey Mouse?&nbsp; In fact, do you think we should be not be able to say, you know, “gay”?</p>



<p>I mean, what’s going on here?&nbsp; What the hell is going on?&nbsp; And it&#8217;s just &#8212; so, I don&#8217;t believe it’s who the vast majority of American people are.</p>



<p>Another point I want to make is &#8212; and I&#8217;ll stop, I apologize, so we can get to questions &#8212; when I got elected and when I was running, I said that I was going to see to it that if I were President, my administration looked like America.</p>



<p>I mean it sincerely.&nbsp; Looked like America.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s exactly what I&#8217;ve done.&nbsp; Of all the thousand appointees I&#8217;ve had that didn’t require Senate confirmation &#8212; well over a thousand &#8212; and all those requiring confirmation, there are more women than men, by a slight margin.&nbsp; It’s not much.&nbsp; But equally as &#8212; you know, there&#8217;s no distinction in terms of qualification.&nbsp; Pick the best person.</p>



<p>I’ve appointed more Circuit Court judges to the federal Circuit Court that were Black than every other president in American history combined.&nbsp; Not because &#8212; not because to make a point, other than the point that &#8212; to let every little Black girl out there know that she could do anything any little white girl can do, given the chance.</p>



<p>You saw how Judge Brown Jackson was treated.&nbsp; The questions they asked her were humiliating.&nbsp; Humiliating.&nbsp; And now we had an event in the White House when she &#8212; on the lawn &#8212; when she was &#8212; was confirmed.&nbsp; And she had a great line she used.&nbsp; She said &#8212; she said it best.&nbsp; She said, “From segregation to the Supreme Court in one generation.&nbsp; I thank my parents.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>You should see, when I go into African American communities, or especially young African American women, they look and they see.&nbsp; Think of all of the young girls of middle-class backgrounds (inaudible) who look up there and see the women who are heading up major Cabinet positions, from the Vice President on down.</p>



<p>So, you know, I &#8212; I think that when &#8212; you&#8217;re more united and stronger than ever when we focus on what we have in common.&nbsp; And I know that sounds, you know, sort of prosaic.&nbsp; I mean &#8212; and I&#8217;ve been doing this a long time.&nbsp; I got involved in public life because of the Civil Rights Movement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I&#8217;m not &#8212; I&#8217;m not making this &#8212; this is not a, you know, painted rosy picture.&nbsp; But we are unique in the world.&nbsp; We&#8217;re the only democracy that is as &#8212; as ethnically, politi- &#8212; excuse me &#8212; ethnically, racially so divided.&nbsp; So &#8212; and if we don&#8217;t bring it together, what in the hell are we going to do?&nbsp; What are we going to do?&nbsp;</p>



<p>So again, I&#8217;m not on a crusade; it’s just about fairness. It&#8217;s about giving people a shot.&nbsp; And like I said, you know, I think that the clear contrast with our Republican colleagues &#8212; and I&#8217;m going to have to start pointing this out.&nbsp; Everybody thinks &#8212; they always talk about the Democratic Party divided because there are two senators who occasionally don’t vote with me.</p>



<p>Well, the bad news is, when you have a 50/50 Senate, you have 51 presidents.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; It becomes a problem.&nbsp; And &#8212; and the use of the filibuster, which I think is so far out of whack, can hold up anything.&nbsp; You need 60 votes.&nbsp; That&#8217;s &#8212; I&#8217;m &#8212; I&#8217;m going on too long, but (inaudible) questions.</p>



<p>But here&#8217;s the deal: One of the reasons that I&#8217;m here is we have to keep the Uni- &#8212; we have to keep the United States Senate.&nbsp; We can&#8217;t afford to lose it.&nbsp; We can&#8217;t afford to lose the House.&nbsp; And I think &#8212; what I&#8217;m concerned about is that I have been so focused on whatever the immediate emergency is, we haven&#8217;t sold the American people what we’ve actually done &#8212; what we’ve actually gotten done.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve gotten a hell of a lot done.&nbsp; A hell of a lot done.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so, this is what I&#8217;m here for: to ask you for your help, when it comes to this off-year election, to help keep the Democratic (inaudible) Senate and the Democratic House so that we can, in fact &#8212;</p>



<p>The la- &#8212; the act- &#8212; actual very last point I’ll make: There are a number of Republicans who are not the MAGA group &#8212; that are not.&nbsp; But guess what?&nbsp; They&#8217;re scared to death.&nbsp;&nbsp;They know &#8212; and I know you know this, Jay, that we could privately name them off the top of our heads &#8212; there are a significant number who if they were to vote where they had voted in the past, if they vote their heart, they’d get a primary and they’ll lose a primary.&nbsp; They would lose a primary.&nbsp; It doesn&#8217;t talk about courage, but it talks about reality.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so, we got to make &#8212; we got to provide room by providing more Democratic votes that allow people to say &#8212;</p>



<p>You know, I remember, early on, learning a lesson from a senior senator when I got there.&nbsp; He said, “It&#8217;s one thing to cast your vote that you feel strongly about on a losing cause. It&#8217;s another thing if you vote with the side that what you care about wins.&nbsp; It ain&#8217;t worth it if you can&#8217;t win.&nbsp; You just get the downside and no upside.”</p>



<p>That’s reality.&nbsp; That’s how, I think &#8212; how human nature functions.&nbsp; And so, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m going to change human nature, but I think the more we are &#8212; go around the country, talking about what we&#8217;ve done, talking about what we can do, talk about the impact of the &#8212; everything from the &#8212; what we&#8217;ve done in terms of healthcare, what we&#8217;ve done in terms of the whole notion of how we&#8217;re going to deal with education, the way in which we&#8217;re going to deal with the notion of the infrastructure bill that’s going to fundamentally change &#8212;</p>



<p>Your state is going to get hundreds of millions of dollars to do good things.</p>



<p>AUDIENCE MEMBER:&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; And &#8212; but I know you know, Jay.&nbsp; It really is.&nbsp; We&#8217;re talking about tens of millions of dollars.&nbsp; I was just at your airport &#8212; I mean, I was just in Portland at their airport.&nbsp; We’re talking about that whole airport facility getting close to a billion dollars.&nbsp; You&#8217;re going to be able to do the same thing here so we can once again invest in our country and our people so we can stay competitive.</p>



<p>With that, I&#8217;m &#8212; I&#8217;m outcompeting myself here because I&#8217;m taking up too much of your time before we get to questions.&nbsp; So, thank you very much for listening.&nbsp; And I&#8217;m prepared to take questions at the appropriate moment.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Portland Yacht Club<br>Portland, Oregon</p>



<p>3:38 P.M. PDT&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Well, thank you all.&nbsp; Joe, thank you, thank you, thank you.</p>



<p>I &#8212; there&#8217;s a guy in here wearing a hat.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Oh, it&#8217;s Ron Wyden.&nbsp; That’s who it is.&nbsp; Hey, Ron.&nbsp; Poor Ron has had to see me all day, God love him.&nbsp; He didn’t &#8212;</p>



<p>SENATOR WYDEN:&nbsp; Oh, lucky me.</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; (Laughs.)&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; Well, look, first of all, Joe, thank you very, very much.&nbsp; I appreciate it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And Carol and Win, I &#8212; you also supported me from the beginning.</p>



<p>It’s wonderful to be back in Portland.&nbsp; I’ll try to make this brief because you’re all standing and I don’t want to keep you on your feet that long.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But look, I’m here for a simple reason, and I mean this sincerely: to say thank you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So many of you were with me when I was trying to get the nomination.&nbsp; And you know that, at the time, when I came to see you, it was shortly after I decided to run.&nbsp; Because I hadn&#8217;t planned on running again.&nbsp; For real.&nbsp; I had no intention of running again.</p>



<p>And to tell you a little story, we &#8212; when I saw those folks come out of the fields down in Charlottesville, carrying those torches &#8212; literally out of the fields &#8212; with Nazi banners and chanting the same anti-Semitic bile that was chanted in the ‘30s, Gov, not a joke, that was when I decided that I thought this can&#8217;t be happening in America.</p>



<p>And then when my predecessor was asked what did he think, he said there were very good people on both sides.&nbsp; And &#8212; but I still concluded that I &#8212; you know, I didn&#8217;t want to run, but I felt like I should.&nbsp; But I just thought it was going to be a really ugly campaign because of the circumstances.</p>



<p>And we have a &#8212; we have a tradition in my family &#8212; for real: Any child can ask for a family meeting.&nbsp; I&#8217;m being deadly earnest about this.&nbsp; And I got a phone call from my eldest granddaughter, Naomi &#8212; Naomi Biden, named after my deceased daughter.&nbsp; And she was, at that time, a freshman in Columbia Law School.&nbsp; And her &#8212; and then her sister, who was at Penn, and another sister, who was in Washington and still in high school, and my deceased son Beau’s two young children.&nbsp; And they &#8212; so they said, “Okay.”&nbsp; This was on a Wednesday.&nbsp; So, we met at Wilmington &#8212; at my home in Wilmington, with Jill and I.</p>



<p>And they started off and said, “Pop, you’ve got to run.”&nbsp; And I said, “Honey, I don’t think I want to do that.&nbsp; It’s going…”&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; No, I’m serious.&nbsp; “It’s going to be &#8212; it’s going to be just a really mean campaign, and I don’t want you guys to have to go through it.”</p>



<p>Because their whole lives, they have been &#8212; either had a grandfather who was a senator, a vice president, or a &#8212; or as a vice president.&nbsp; And one of their dads had been an attorney general for a long time as well.&nbsp; And so, they knew what it was going to be like.&nbsp; And they started off and said that, “Daddy, we want you to do it.&nbsp; We want you to do it.”&nbsp; And they made the case.</p>



<p>And my youngest &#8212; now he&#8217;s 16 years old &#8212; grandson, my son Hunter&#8217;s son &#8212; my son Beau’s son named Hunter said, “Pop…” &#8212; and he took out his cellphone and showed a picture &#8212; I hadn&#8217;t plan on saying this.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know why I&#8217;m telling you, but Joe reminded me of it.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>He showed me a picture of coming out of mass &#8212; the memorial mass &#8212; the burial of my &#8212; of my son Beau.&nbsp; And I had my hand on the hand-draped coffin in the military funeral.&nbsp; And I had my hand around the neck of my little &#8212; then he was 14 years old &#8212; I mean, excuse me, about 12 years old &#8212; grandson.&nbsp; And &#8212; and the caption underneath the picture was, “Biden molests another child.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I said &#8212; and he said, “But, Pop, it&#8217;s okay.&nbsp; Daddy wants you to run.&nbsp; You got to run.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>And when I ran &#8212; when I came out to see some of you at that time, I told you I was running for three reasons.&nbsp; I was running to restore the soul of this country &#8212; some decency and honor.&nbsp; And I meant that sincerely.&nbsp; And I remember I got widely criticized for saying it.</p>



<p>And secondly, I was going to rebuild the backbone of the country, which I consider to be the middle class.&nbsp; When the middle class does well, everybody does well.&nbsp; The poor have a way up and the wealthy still are able to do very well.</p>



<p>And lastly, I was going to try to unite America.&nbsp; Because I think in a democracy, you cannot sustain growth unless &#8212; without unity.&nbsp; It’s just not possible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And &#8212; and during the campaign, I talked about the fact that in my time as the eight years as Vice President, that I spent a fair amount of time doing foreign policy for the President and traveling around the world.&nbsp; And I spent more time with Xi Jinping than any other world leader, just in terms of raw numbers.&nbsp; I traveled 17,000 miles with him throughout Asia and the United States.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And he’s very straightforward and blunt.&nbsp; He doesn’t think democracies can function in the 21st century.&nbsp; Not a joke.&nbsp; This is deadly earnest.&nbsp; Deadly earnest.&nbsp; Same attitude with less grace than &#8212; that Putin has and many other leaders around the world.</p>



<p>Because things are changing so rapidly, they do not believe that democracy can &#8212; that democracies can adjust.&nbsp; Because the world is changing.&nbsp; We&#8217;re at one of those inflection points in world history where, regardless who&#8217;s the head of what state, there&#8217;s fundamental change taking place.&nbsp; Whether it&#8217;s a negative pla- &#8212; place &#8212; change taking place because of climate or things that are not bad.&nbsp; But just technology changing everything.</p>



<p>And &#8212; and so, one of the things that happened was I &#8212; I found working with &#8212; and I mean it sincerely &#8212; working with Ron and &#8212; and your delegation that we all figured out we had to begin to invest in America.&nbsp; We had to invest in America.&nbsp; Not a joke.</p>



<p>We used to have, for example, the number-one infrastructure in the world.&nbsp; We invested in America.&nbsp; We invest &#8212;</p>



<p>One of the reasons why we were the leading country in the world in the 20th century was because we were the best-educated country in the world.&nbsp; Others had more &#8212; more prominent education systems for the narrow minority, but we were the only country in the world that had universal education from kindergarten through high school, for 12 years, regardless.&nbsp; And it mattered.</p>



<p>And so, one of the things that we started talking about was: How do we invest in our people?&nbsp; What do we do?&nbsp; Because so many people were being left behind.&nbsp; And so, that&#8217;s what this was all about when we started.</p>



<p>And one of the things that we did to begin this administration, we found ourselves in the situation where I believe we had to have a Recovery Act that was consequential.&nbsp; And I know everybody thought it was crazy, it had nothing to do with inflation because we decided to spend $1.9 trillion investing in America.&nbsp; And we did.&nbsp; We brought the economy back.</p>



<p>And by the way, that same budget year in 2021, we reduced the federal deficit by $350 billion at the same time.&nbsp;&nbsp;(Applause.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>And investing in America was investing in our infrastructure as well.&nbsp; We used to be the number-one country in the world in terms of the most modern infrastructure.&nbsp; We&#8217;re now number 13.&nbsp; Thirteen other countr- &#8212; twelve other countries have better infrastructure than we do.</p>



<p>And what the hell do you think grows the economies?&nbsp; Infrastructure grows economies, and it gives people opportunities.&nbsp; It creates good jobs.&nbsp; It creates opportunities for people to move.</p>



<p>Now, with the help of Ron and the rest of your delegation, we passed a $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill that was designed &#8212; (applause) &#8212; I hope some of you are making more than $400,000 a year, but if you made less than 400, you didn&#8217;t pay a single penny in taxes &#8212; in your taxes.&nbsp; Not a joke.&nbsp; Not a joke.</p>



<p>And so, what began to happen is: We began to rebuild and invest in our people in ways we hadn&#8217;t done before.&nbsp; And the other thing I decided to do when I said “restore the soul of America,” I believe America should look like the &#8212; that my administration should look like America &#8212; look like America.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of over a thousand appointments I&#8217;ve made in the federal government and my Cabinet as well, there are slightly more women than men.&nbsp; Because &#8212; (laughter) &#8212; no, it&#8217;s important.&nbsp; No, no.&nbsp; But it really is important for all those young women out there.&nbsp; It&#8217;s critically important.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve been able to appoint more African American Circuit Court of Appeals judges than every other president in the history of the nation combined.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because, look, in the 21st century, we&#8217;ve got to be who we are.&nbsp; We are a multi-ethnic nation.&nbsp; But we all have one fundamental commitment we&#8217;ve all made.&nbsp; You know, we&#8217;re the only country in the world that is formed based on an idea &#8212; not geography, not ethnicity &#8212; and I’m &#8212; I&#8217;m deadly earnest about this.&nbsp; Only one.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, what is the reason why we came together?&nbsp; Because we said, “We hold these truths to be self-evident…all men and women are created equal…endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights…Life, Liberty…” &#8212; I know it sounds corny, but that&#8217;s who we are.&nbsp; No other nation in the world has been built on an idea &#8212; an idea we have never realized &#8212; we have never realized but, until the last guy came along, we have never fully walked away from.&nbsp; We’ve gradually made progress.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so the point that I want to you all is: There is so much that we still have to do.&nbsp; Because, you know &#8212; and one of the things that&#8217;s changed is that &#8212; and I&#8217;ll be very brief: On foreign policy, you recall that the last administration, some &#8212;</p>



<p>By the way, I&#8217;m not just talking about former President Trump.&nbsp; We have a whole &#8212; this is not your father&#8217;s Republican Party, by any stretch of the imagination.&nbsp; This is the MAGA Party.&nbsp; Not a joke.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Think about it: This is a party that&#8217;s owned whol- &#8212; wholly by guys like the senator from Texas and others.&nbsp; I mean, really and truly, did you ever think we&#8217;d be in a circumstance where the Republican platform would be that &#8212; and they (inaudible) the guy &#8212; the head of the rec- &#8212; the head of the Senate campaign committee in the United States Senate and Republican Party put out a platform that even Republicans have walked away from, some of them, saying &#8212; what? &#8212; that every five years we should reconsider whether we keep Social Security, Medi- &#8212;</p>



<p>AUDIENCE MEMBER:&nbsp; (Inaudible.)</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; This is the God&#8217;s truth.&nbsp; If you want a copy of it, I will send it to you.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; No, no, but this is what they&#8217;re running on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And by the way, remember why we won &#8212; we won all those seats back in 2018?&nbsp; Because they kept, for the 500th time, trying to do away with Obamacare.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But what people didn&#8217;t know and what &#8212; my point I&#8217;m about to get to: They don&#8217;t know a lot about what we&#8217;ve already done, just like they didn&#8217;t know then because things move so quickly.</p>



<p>All we had to do &#8212; I went into 58 &#8212; 56 races as a guy who was out of office for two years, as a former Vice President.&nbsp; And guess what?&nbsp; We &#8212; in all Republican districts &#8212; incumbent Republicans &#8212; we won 46 of them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And here&#8217;s the deal &#8212; (applause) &#8212; no, no, here’s &#8212; no, here’s what we ran on &#8212; it&#8217;s a really important point, at least from my perspective.&nbsp; We said, “Do you know why you have a preexisting condition and you can&#8217;t be no- &#8212; denied insurance? Because of Obamacare.”&nbsp; Nobody knew it.&nbsp; We won all those races.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Well, what I&#8217;m worried about now is that we have done one hell of a job, but the fact is that because things have moved so rapidly, so profoundly, it&#8217;s hard for people &#8212; no, let me just give you a few statistics.</p>



<p>We have created 7.9 million jobs in the first 14 months of my administration &#8212; more than any in history.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have created &#8212; we said manufacturing is dead in America.&nbsp; Well, guess what?&nbsp; We&#8217;ve created 430,000 new manufacturing jobs, and it&#8217;s still climbing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We &#8212; also unemployment rate went from 3 &#8212; went from 6.4 percent to 3.6 percent &#8212; the fastest decline in American history.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>We&#8217;re in a situation where we reduced the deficit by $350 billion in last year&#8217;s budget.&nbsp; And this year, it&#8217;s on track, literally, to reduce it by $1.3 trillion.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>All we’re saying is &#8212; I&#8217;m a capitalist; I&#8217;m a guy who thinks if you can make a million or a billion or 100 million dollars, you should do it.&nbsp; But everybody has to pay their fair share.&nbsp; Just pay a little bit.</p>



<p>Today, as Ron will point out to you &#8212; not a joke &#8212; there&#8217;s seven hundred and ninety-some &#8212; I think that&#8217;s the number &#8212; or sixty-some billionaires in America.&nbsp; Average tax paid: 3 percent.&nbsp; Okay?&nbsp;</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t want &#8212; just &#8212; just pay a little of their &#8212; I come from the corporate state of the world, Delaware.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; There are more corporations in my state registered than every other state in the nation combined.&nbsp; But guess what?</p>



<p>Of the Fortune 500 companies, 40 of them &#8212; I think a total of $40 billion &#8212; did not pay a single penny.&nbsp; Nothing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Look at the firemen who come to help you out.&nbsp; Look at the cop, the school teacher, the nurse.</p>



<p>AUDIENCE MEMBER:&nbsp; Yay!&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; (Inaudible) seven months in an ICU, when &#8212; when I had two craniotomies because of aneurisms and a major embolism.&nbsp; My son lay in a bed for 19 months.&nbsp; The doctors let you live; the nurses make you want to live.</p>



<p>AUDIENCE MEMBER:&nbsp; Oh.</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; No, no &#8212; male and female.&nbsp; I swear to God.&nbsp; (Inaudible.)&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>Oh, I didn’t see you, Senator.&nbsp; I’m sorry.&nbsp; (Inaudible.)&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>But here&#8217;s the deal, guys: There&#8217;s so much we can do &#8212; so much we can do.&nbsp; But what I realized is I&#8217;m making the same mistake &#8212; and I mean this as a compliment because he’s still my best buddy &#8212; that &#8212; that we made when &#8212; in the Obama-Biden administration.</p>



<p>I remember saying to Barack after we passed the Affordable Care Act, I said, “Let&#8217;s take a victory lap.”&nbsp; He said, “We don&#8217;t have time.&nbsp; We don’t have time.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>But guess what?&nbsp; No one knew what was in it.&nbsp; They didn&#8217;t know why they had what they had.&nbsp; They didn&#8217;t know why we were able to do the &#8212; people were covered when they were never covered before.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Well, here&#8217;s what we &#8212; I have to do.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not doing a very good job because so much &#8212; it’s like &#8212; you know, I used to say in Barack&#8217;s administration, “Everything landed on his desk but locusts.”&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Well, they landed on my desk.&nbsp; (Laughter.)</p>



<p>So, here&#8217;s the thing &#8212; and I&#8217;m going to hush up: One of the things I was absolutely been convinced of &#8212; because I&#8217;ve been involved in American foreign policy for my whole career since I was a 29-year-old kid in the Foreign Relations Committee (inaudible) &#8212; and that is that NATO &#8212; what happens in Europe is the foundation of what we can do around the rest of the world.&nbsp; Because there&#8217;s no way we can escape the conflict that occurs in Europe.&nbsp; It&#8217;s never occurred, never happened.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so, remember: The last guy treated NATO like it was a protection racket.&nbsp; Not a joke.&nbsp; “If you don&#8217;t do such and such, we&#8217;re not going to protect &#8212; we&#8217;re not going to honor Article 5.&nbsp; We&#8217;re not going to honor our commitment.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Well, guess what?&nbsp; As Ron will tell you, I was predicting that we would have serious problems and there would be an invasion of Ukraine by &#8212; by Putin.&nbsp; Well, he not only invaded Ukraine, he&#8217;s done so much more.&nbsp; He&#8217;s a butcher.&nbsp; They have an actual butcher.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve been to Ukraine many times.&nbsp; Folks, these &#8212; it’s just what&#8217;s happening is &#8212; is just sinful.&nbsp; And I&#8217;m not trying to be moralistic, but it’s true: It’s sinful what he&#8217;s doing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the point is: The most important thing to have happen that we&#8217;ve had to do is how do we keep NATO and Europe united &#8212; united.&nbsp; Because I guarantee you Putin has been hoping and believing that NATO would crack and we would not make any (inaudible) sacrifice to help and deal with what he was doing in &#8212; in Eastern Europe.</p>



<p>But guess what?&nbsp; I&#8217;ve had over 120 meetings and/or &#8212; and/or what &#8212; what do we call them on the &#8212; when we do the &#8212;</p>



<p>AUDIENCE:&nbsp; Zoom.</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Zoom.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; With &#8212; with the world leaders.&nbsp; I&#8217;m serious.&nbsp; Over 120 times.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A matter of fact, the press was pointing out that &#8212; I guess it was two days ago &#8212; I called all the world &#8212; the major leaders together in the world to say, “We got to stick together,” and keeping them together.&nbsp; Because if we break &#8212; if it breaks up, we got a real problem in terms of our long-term security and a lot else that’s going to happen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, it takes time and effort.&nbsp; But we&#8217;re &#8212; I&#8217;m not going to send a single American force into Ukraine to start World War Three.&nbsp; But we&#8217;re going to give every Ukrainian military capability that they have &#8212; that they need, in order to protect themselves.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>Between Ukraine and COVID, we have been really stymied in a big way.&nbsp; Look what we have.&nbsp; Although we have &#8212; although jobs are open, jobs are up, pay is up for people &#8212; the average pay has gone up.&nbsp; But guess what?&nbsp; Inflation really is killing people.</p>



<p>I came from a family that when the price of a gallon of gasoline went up, it was a topic of conversation at the kitchen table.&nbsp; I mean, for real.&nbsp; Not a joke.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Well, we got two bad things happening at one time.&nbsp; One, one of the major suppliers of oil and gas in the world happens to be an absolute &#8212; well, anyway.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Not a good person.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>But guess what?&nbsp; As we cut off the oil for it to slow up &#8212; slow him up and make sure that there&#8217;s a price to pay, it raises the price of &#8212; of gas.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And it affects a lot of people.&nbsp; It affects, in Europe, particularly, home heating, oil, and a whole range of other things.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so, one of the things that we have to do is figure out how &#8212; and the second thing is &#8212; the reason why you go buy a dozen eggs and it costs more money, the reason why you buy a loaf of bread and it costs more money is because the breadbaskets of the world starts off in Ukraine, Russia, and then United States, in terms of wheat and corn.&nbsp; And so, we &#8212; we’re going to go through a tough period.</p>



<p>But the thing is that there&#8217;s nothing beyond our capacity.&nbsp; We can do all of these things if we, in fact, have the gumption and confidence of who we are.&nbsp; This is the United States of America.&nbsp; There&#8217;s not a damn thing we can&#8217;t do &#8212; nothing we can&#8217;t do.</p>



<p>And with the help of your two senators and your congressional delegation &#8212; and I&#8217;m not being solicitous, because they have been major leaders in this effort.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>We’re in a situation where we&#8217;re going to &#8212; we&#8217;re going to gain control of this.&nbsp; For example, you know, one of the reasons for inflation last year was that one third of all the inflation is because of the lack of computer chips.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You’ve ever heard of a little outfit called Intel?&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Well, guess what?&nbsp; The head of Intel came to see me &#8212; asked if he could come and see me.&nbsp; He&#8217;s going to invest $20 billion in new facilities (inaudible).&nbsp; And if we pass the bill that (inaudible) trying to get done (inaudible) in the United States Senate, we’re going to &#8212; he’s going to invest another $100 billion &#8212; $100 billion.</p>



<p>The United States of America invented the computer chip.&nbsp; We’re the ones who made it &#8212; who made the progre- &#8212; progressed all along.&nbsp; But we just &#8212; we just stopped investing in ourselves, so you go to Taiwan, you go to other places to get computer chips.</p>



<p>Well, because the automobile &#8212; there&#8217;s nothing, from that cellphone you have in your hand to the automobile you&#8217;re driving, that can be functioned or made without a computer &#8212; those chips.</p>



<p>Well, guess what?&nbsp; The fact is that we weren’t making them in the United States.&nbsp; And so, what I decided, with the help your delegation, is that there’s &#8212; and I&#8217;ll end with this.&nbsp; I&#8217;m sorry to go on so long.&nbsp; (Laughter and applause.)&nbsp; (Inaudible)</p>



<p>I want you to know, I believe in every fiber of my being &#8212; and I&#8217;ve been doing this my whole life &#8212; we&#8217;re on the verge of such incredible breakthroughs in this country across the board.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Every &#8212; out of &#8212; my mother, God love her, she’d say, “Out of everything bad, Joey, something good will come (inaudible).”&nbsp;</p>



<p>We&#8217;re in a position where, you&#8217;re going to see, we&#8217;re going to move &#8212; I was &#8212; I led the effort on COP in the &#8212; in, anyway &#8212; (laughter) &#8212; that will &#8212; what we did was we &#8212; you know, I got another 120 nations to sign a commitment that we were going to plant another trillion &#8212; a billion trees in the next year.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>(Inaudible) all the research we&#8217;re doing, in terms of breakthrough technology, that deal with &#8212; with the whole notion of climate change and what we can do.&nbsp; And now we&#8217;re in a position where we should look at it &#8212; we have no choice but to do it.&nbsp; Nations that were reluctant to &#8212; to step up and do what they had to do are now going, “We have no choice.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>So I guess what I&#8217;m trying to say to you all is &#8212; and I should have stuck to my speech.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; What I&#8217;m trying to say is: I just want you to know I am absolutely, positively certain that we can once again lead the world in a way that&#8217;s consistent with who we are as a people, and we can grow this country in ways where we can benefit not only ourselves but the rest of the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And all the things we&#8217;re doing on the climate change side, that’s all technologies we will be able to export and not only help the rest of the world, but make sure that we, in fact, create all these good-paying jobs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example &#8212; I’ll end with Intel.&nbsp; Intel &#8212; they&#8217;re going to have a total of &#8212; I think it&#8217;s 13,000 jobs on this one site at $20 billion.&nbsp; Well, 7,000 of those jobs are the construction phase; there are four phases.</p>



<p>Well, guess what?&nbsp; The factor is that the remaining jobs &#8212; running the factory &#8212; you know that the average salary is going to be?&nbsp; And you can be a blue-collar worker and still make it.&nbsp; A hundred and thirty-four thousand dollars a year.</p>



<p>We are in a position like no other nation.&nbsp; And we can do it and benefit ourselves while benefiting other countries as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, if there was any time to be engaged, I think this is the time.&nbsp; I really mean it.&nbsp; I can&#8217;t think of any other time.&nbsp; And again, I&#8217;m a kid who got elected from a, I guess, technically lower middle class &#8212; but a middle-class household when I was 29 years old &#8212; in the United States Senate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And as my Senate colleagues may remember, I used to have the dubious distinction every year of being listed as the poorest man in Congress.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; But I was making a good salary because I was a senator.</p>



<p>But my generic point is: There&#8217;s nothing we &#8212; beyond our capacity.&nbsp; There really and truly isn’t.&nbsp; And I&#8217;m going to need your help again in this off-year election, help making sure that we keep the Senate and keep the House.&nbsp; I think we can pick up two Senate seats.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>But I admit to you, what I haven&#8217;t done &#8212; and the reason I&#8217;m getting out on the road again instead of dealing with the day-to-day emergencies in my office &#8212; is making the case of what we&#8217;ve done.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I mean this sincerely: No congressional delegation has done more for the things I&#8217;m talking about than your congressmen and senators in this state.&nbsp; That&#8217;s the God’s truth.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>So, if (inaudible) knocking on your door, saying, “I’m trying to raise money to help the following people” &#8212; (laughter) &#8212; you know, just think of &#8212; just think of what our Republican colleagues would do if they win.&nbsp;</p>



<p>AUDIENCE:&nbsp; (Groans.)</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; No, no, I’m serious.&nbsp; Think of what they &#8212; and are saying.&nbsp; They’re not kidding about &#8212; and we haven&#8217;t even talked about voting rights and gun violence and criminal justice, immigration &#8212; all things.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And we just have &#8212; you know, the good news is we have 50 senators and the Vice President.&nbsp; And the bad news is there are 51 presidents.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Any one can declare themselves president, as two Democrats have.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The idea that somehow we have split the Democratic &#8212; which all people read about is the Democrats are divided.&nbsp; Forty-eight members of the United States Senate have voted with me on 96 percent of the time.&nbsp; Forty-eight.&nbsp; Two have not.&nbsp; (Laughter.)</p>



<p>But all kidding aside, think about it.&nbsp; There&#8217;s virtually no Republican support.&nbsp; My &#8212; as my colleagues can tell you &#8212; and, by the way, I&#8217;ve been a guy who&#8217;s not been one of these guys suggesting Democrats are always bad.&nbsp; I mean that sincerely.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I had a reputation &#8212; I think my colleagues would tell you &#8212; in the Senate of putting these things together, Democrats and Republicans.</p>



<p>But what&#8217;s happened is that there are a number of Republicans who know better, but they&#8217;re afraid.&nbsp; I know &#8212; I won&#8217;t ask for names, but I&#8217;m sure my colleagues can tell you from the Senate at least six United States senators have come to me and said, “I know &#8212; I know I should vote for this, Joe.&nbsp; But if I do, they’ll primary me and I&#8217;ll be out.”&nbsp; It&#8217;s not very courageous, but this &#8212; the Far Right has taken over that party.</p>



<p>And it&#8217;s not even conservative in a traditional sense of conservative.&nbsp; It&#8217;s mean.&nbsp; It’s ugly.&nbsp; It’s the way &#8212; look what&#8217;s happening down in Florida.&nbsp; (Inaudible), they’re going after Mickey Mouse.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; (Inaudible.)&nbsp; I mean, seriously, think about it.&nbsp; As my friend used to say (inaudible), “Who woulda thunk it?”&nbsp; (Laughter.)</p>



<p>Folks, look, I&#8217;ve talked &#8212; spoken too long.&nbsp; I want to thank you for all you did for me last time around.&nbsp; I’m determined to make sure we keep the House and the Senate.&nbsp; And so, thank you for the help you’ve given me before, and I hope you can help the DNC move along and raise money to help these people who are going need our help.</p>



<p>Thank you.&nbsp; And, Governor, (inaudible).&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>
