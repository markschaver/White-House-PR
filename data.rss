<p>I want to convey my sincere gratitude to the Senate for confirming Julien&nbsp;X.&nbsp;Neals as a judge for the&nbsp;U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey&nbsp;and Regina M. Rodriguez as a judge for the&nbsp;U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado, both with bipartisan support.</p>



<p>I was honored to include both of them in the very first nominations I made to the Federal Bench, and they embody the professional excellence and devotion to the rule of law and our Constitution that the American people expect of Federal judges.</p>



<p>They are both&nbsp;highly&nbsp;qualified, and they represent the diversity that is one of the ultimate strengths of our nation—in all branches of government, including the judiciary.</p>



<p>Other nominees are awaiting confirmation who also have bipartisan support, and I hope they will be rapidly confirmed as well.</p>



<p>I am also thankful that we are on track to have confirmed the most judges by July of the first year of a President’s first term in over 50 years.</p>



<p>I look forward to continuing to make nominations at an historic pace and working closely with the Senate on many more confirmations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>Today, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and Director of the National Economic Council Brian Deese met with Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland, Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack, Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo, Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg, Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm, Secretary of Homeland Security Mayorkas, U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai, Small Business Administrator Isabel Guzman, Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman, Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo, Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks, and Acting Commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Dr. Janet Woodcock to discuss the Biden Administration’s whole-of-government effort to build diverse, resilient supply chains essential to our national security, our economic security, and our competitiveness. Sullivan and Deese thanked the Cabinet members and their teams for their work to deliver immediate next steps and robust recommendations to strengthen our supply chains in both the short-term and the long term.</p>



<p>Sullivan, Deese, and the cabinet members stressed the importance of using all available tools across the United States government and continuing partnerships with all stakeholders—including business, labor, and environmental groups—to identify further actions we can continue to take to strengthen our supply chains.</p>



<p>In the meeting, they also discussed the importance of being nimble to address emerging supply chain issues resulting from a rapid return of economic activity, in part due to President Biden’s historic vaccination program and economic relief efforts. They thanked Secretaries Raimondo, Buttigieg, and Vilsack for taking lead on the new Supply Chain Disruptions Task Force, which will work closely with the White House including the Domestic Policy Council, the National Economic Council, the National Security Council, and Council of Economic Advisers, to tackle near-term bottle-necks in the semiconductor, homebuilding and construction, transportation, and agriculture and food industries.</p>



<p>Lastly, they discussed the broad bipartisan agreement for strengthening supply chains, including the bipartisan bill to investment more than $50 billion in domestic production and R&amp;D to advance U.S. leadership in the semiconductor industry. The participants also discussed how the findings of the reports reinforce the need for the transformative investments proposed in the President’s American Jobs Plan. The American Jobs Plan will make a once-in-a-generation capital investment to create millions of good-paying jobs, rebuild our country’s infrastructure, and position the U.S. to compete globally in key industries.</p>

<p>The President has spoken to a number of members of the House and Senate the past two days.</p>



<p>He informed Senator Capito today that the latest offer from her group did not, in his view, meet the essential needs of our country to restore our roads and bridges, prepare us for our clean energy future, and create jobs. He offered his gratitude to her for her efforts and good faith conversations, but expressed his disappointment that, while he was willing to reduce his plan by more than $1 trillion, the Republican group had increased their proposed new investments by only $150 billion.</p>



<p>The President also spoke with Senators Sinema, Cassidy, and Manchin today. He urged them to continue their work with other Democrats and Republicans to develop a bipartisan proposal that he hopes will be more responsive to the country’s pressing infrastructure needs. The President said that he would be in contact with members of the group by phone while in Europe, and he designated his Jobs Cabinet and White House aides Steve Ricchetti, Louisa Terrell, and Brian Deese to meet with them in person to advance this effort.</p>



<p>From Day One, the President has been clear that he has two red lines: he will not raise taxes on Americans who make under $400,000 and he will not accept inaction as the outcome. To ensure that the American Jobs Plan moves forward on a timely basis, the President spoke with Speaker Pelosi to consult with her on efforts to move forward on a jobs package in the House this month. In the same regard, the President also spoke with Senate Majority Leader Schumer to discuss the need to commence work on the budget resolution process so that legislation to advance the President’s economic priorities and tax reform plans could move to the Senate floor in July. The President is committed to moving his economic legislation through Congress this summer, and is pursuing multiple paths to get this done.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>Today, President Biden signed an Executive Order to further address the ongoing national emergency declared in Executive Order (E.O.) 13219 of June 26, 2001, and continued in E.O. 13304 of May 28, 2003, related to the Western Balkans.&nbsp; Today’s E.O. provides additional sanctions authorities, including to target individuals who threaten the peace, security, stability, or territorial integrity of any area or state in the Western Balkans as well as those responsible for or complicit in, or who have directly or indirectly engaged in, serious human rights abuse in the Western Balkans, among other things.&nbsp; The E.O. the President is signing today builds on the existing national emergency and expands the designation criteria, to address such challenges as corruption, and other actions that obstruct key institutions and international agreements. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Corruption anywhere directly damages the foreign policy, national security, and economic health of the United States and our partners and allies.&nbsp; That is why the United States is committed to promoting accountability and combating impunity for those involved in significant corruption in the Western Balkans and throughout the world.&nbsp; By definition, corruption serves the interests of those few who engage in it, lining their own pockets and accountable only to their own personal interests, not the interests of a country or its people.&nbsp; Corruption saps economic growth, facilitates organized crime, and undermines confidence in democratic processes.&nbsp; These forces open the door for our strategic adversaries to undermine democracy, stymie progress toward effective and accountable governance and prevent the Western Balkans region from achieving full integration into transatlantic institutions.&nbsp; They allow individuals to exploit weak rule of law and to profit from systemic corruption at the expense of ordinary citizens.&nbsp; They thereby constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Specifically, the E.O. the President is signing today:</p>



<ul><li>Underscores the United States’ longstanding commitment to implementation of the post-war agreements and institutions established following the breakup of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia;<br></li><li>Expands sanctions designation criteria to include activities, among others, related to:&nbsp; threatening the peace, security, stability, or territorial integrity of any area or state in the Western Balkans; undermining democratic processes or institutions in the Western Balkans; engaging in serious human rights abuse in the Western Balkans; and engaging in corruption related to the Western Balkans;<br></li><li>Expands our ability to target actors engaged in a violation of, or an act that has obstructed or threatened the implementation of, any regional security, peace, cooperation, or mutual recognition agreement or framework or accountability mechanism related to the Western Balkans beyond previous E.O.s, to include the Prespa Agreement, the Conclusions of the Peace Implementation Conference, and the International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals, the successor to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia; and<br></li><li>Clarifies that the geographic scope of the Western Balkans includes the territory of&nbsp;the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Republic of Albania.</li></ul>



<p>All property and interests in property of persons designated pursuant to this E.O. that are or come within the United States or the possession or control of U.S. persons are blocked, and U.S. persons are generally prohibited from engaging in transactions with them.&nbsp; In addition, individuals sanctioned under this E.O. will be banned from entering the United States or holding a U.S. visa.&nbsp; Ensuring the security and political stability of the Western Balkans region is consistent with the Biden Administration’s commitment to advancing core U.S. national security interests, including the protection of democratic institutions. &nbsp;The Administration will continue to address the challenges in the region head on.&nbsp; The Department of the Treasury, in consultation with the Department of State will continue to update the list of individuals subject to sanctions under this order.&nbsp;</p>

MILITARY OPERATIONS IN SUPPORT OF UNITED STATES COUNTERTERRORISM&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>Dear Madam Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)<br><br>I am providing this supplemental consolidated report, prepared by my Administration and consistent with the War Powers Resolution (Public Law 93-148), as part of my efforts to keep the Congress informed about deployments of United States Armed Forces equipped for combat.<br><br>MILITARY OPERATIONS IN SUPPORT OF UNITED STATES COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS<br><br>In furtherance of counterterrorism efforts, the United States continues to work with partners around the globe, with a particular focus on the United States Central and Africa Commands&#8217; areas of responsibility.&nbsp; In this context, the United&nbsp;States has deployed forces to conduct counterterrorism operations and to advise, assist, and accompany security forces of select foreign partners on counterterrorism operations.&nbsp; In the majority of these locations, the mission of United States military personnel is to facilitate counterterrorism operations of foreign partner forces and does not include routine engagement in combat.&nbsp; In many of these locations, the security environment is such that United States military personnel may be required to defend themselves against threats or attacks, and, to that end, the United States may deploy United States military personnel with weapons and other appropriate equipment&nbsp;for force protection.&nbsp; Specific information about counterterrorism deployments to select countries is provided below, and a classified annex to this report provides further information.<br><br>Military Operations Against al-Qa&#8217;ida, the Taliban, and Associated Forces and in Support of Related United States Counterterrorism Objectives<br><br>Since October 7, 2001, United States Armed Forces, including Special Operations Forces, have conducted counterterrorism combat operations against al-Qa&#8217;ida, the Taliban, and associated forces. &nbsp;Since August 2014, these operations have targeted the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), also known as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), which was formerly known as al-Qa&#8217;ida in Iraq.&nbsp; In support of these and other overseas operations, the United States has deployed combat-equipped forces to several locations in the United States Central, European, Africa, Southern, and Indo-Pacific Commands&#8217; areas of responsibility.&nbsp; Such operations and deployments have been reported previously, consistent with Public Law 107-40, Public Law 107-243, the War Powers Resolution, and other statutes.&nbsp; These ongoing operations, which the United States has&nbsp;carried out with the assistance of numerous international partners, have been successful in seriously degrading ISIS capabilities in Syria and Iraq.&nbsp; If necessary, in response to terrorist threats, I will direct additional measures to protect the people and interests of the United States.&nbsp; It is not possible to know at this time the precise scope or the duration of the deployments of United States Armed Forces that are or&nbsp;will be necessary to counter terrorist threats to the United&nbsp;States.<br><br><strong>Afghanistan.</strong>&nbsp; On April 14, 2021, I directed the withdrawal of United States forces from Afghanistan starting on May 1, 2021, and concluding by September 11, 2021.&nbsp; Since May 1, 2021, we have been withdrawing United States forces in a safe, deliberate, and responsible manner and in full coordination with&nbsp;our partners and allies in Afghanistan.&nbsp; Additionally, we&nbsp;are making plans to ensure the security of our diplomats who&nbsp;may remain in Afghanistan, while also re-organizing our counterterrorism capabilities outside Afghanistan to address threats to the United&nbsp;States homeland and United States interests that may arise from inside Afghanistan.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Iraq and Syria.</strong>&nbsp; As part of a comprehensive strategy to defeat ISIS, United States Armed Forces are working by, with, and through local partners in conducting airstrikes and other necessary operations against ISIS forces in Iraq and Syria and against al-Qa&#8217;ida in Syria.&nbsp; A small presence of United States Armed Forces remains in strategically significant locations in Syria to conduct operations, in partnership with indigenous ground forces, to address continuing terrorist threats emanating from Syria.&nbsp; United States Armed Forces in Iraq continue to advise, coordinate with, and provide support to select elements of the Iraqi security forces, including Iraqi Kurdish security forces. &nbsp;Support to Iraqi security forces includes training, equipment, communications support, and intelligence support.&nbsp; United States Armed Forces also provide limited support to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization mission in Iraq.&nbsp; Actions in Iraq are being undertaken in coordination with the Government of Iraq and the Kurdistan Regional Government, and in conjunction with coalition partners.<br><br>As reported in February 2021, I directed a targeted military strike against infrastructure in eastern Syria used by Iran‑supported non-state militia groups.&nbsp; Those non-state militia groups were involved in attacks against United States and Coalition personnel in Iraq.&nbsp; These groups were also engaged in ongoing planning for future such attacks.&nbsp; I directed this action consistent with my responsibility to protect United States citizens both at home and abroad and in furtherance of United States national security interests, pursuant to my constitutional authority to conduct United States foreign relations and as Commander in Chief and Chief Executive.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Arabian Peninsula Region.&nbsp; </strong>A small number of United States military personnel are deployed to Yemen to conduct operations against al-Qa&#8217;ida in the Arabian Peninsula and ISIS.&nbsp; The United States military continues to work closely with the Government of the Republic of Yemen and regional partner forces to degrade the terrorist threat posed by those groups.<br><br>I have directed an end to United States support for the Saudi‑led Coalition&#8217;s offensive military operations against the&nbsp;Houthis in Yemen.&nbsp; United States Armed Forces, in a non‑combat role, continue to provide military advice and limited information to regional forces for defensive and training purposes only as they relate to the Saudi-led Coalition&#8217;s campaign against the Houthis in Yemen.&nbsp; Such support does not involve United States Armed Forces in hostilities with the Houthis for the purposes of the War Powers Resolution.<br><br>United States Armed Forces are deployed to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to protect United States forces and interests in&nbsp;the region against hostile action by Iran or Iran-backed groups.&nbsp; These forces, operating in coordination with the Government of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, provide air and missile defense capabilities and support the operation of&nbsp;United&nbsp;States fighter aircraft.&nbsp; The total number of United&nbsp;States forces in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is approximately 2,742.<br><br><strong>Jordan.&nbsp; </strong>At the request of the Government of Jordan, approximately 2,976 United States military personnel are deployed to Jordan to support Defeat-ISIS operations, to enhance Jordan&#8217;s security, and to promote regional stability.<br><br><strong>Lebanon.&nbsp; </strong>At the request of the Government of Lebanon, approximately 83 United States military personnel are deployed&nbsp;to Lebanon to enhance the government&#8217;s counterterrorism capabilities and to support the counterterrorism operations of Lebanese security forces.<br><br><strong>Turkey.&nbsp; </strong>United States Armed Forces remain deployed to Turkey, at the Turkish government&#8217;s request, to support Defeat-ISIS operations and to enhance Turkey&#8217;s security.<br><br><strong>East Africa Region.&nbsp; </strong>At the direction of the prior administration, the majority of United States forces in Somalia redeployed or repositioned to neighboring countries prior to my inauguration as President.&nbsp; United States Armed Forces based outside Somalia continue to counter the terrorist threat posed by ISIS and al-Shabaab, an associated force of al-Qa&#8217;ida, in Somalia.&nbsp; Since the last periodic report, United States forces have conducted a small number of airstrikes against al-Shabaab, and remain prepared to conduct airstrikes against ISIS and al‑Shabaab terrorists. &nbsp;United States military personnel conduct periodic engagements in Somalia to train, advise, and assist regional forces, including Somali and African Union Mission in&nbsp;Somalia forces, during counterterrorism operations.&nbsp; United&nbsp;States Armed Forces are deployed to Kenya to support counterterrorism operations in East Africa. &nbsp;United States military personnel continue to partner with the Government of Djibouti, which has permitted use of Djiboutian territory for basing of United States Armed Forces.&nbsp; United States military personnel remain deployed to Djibouti, including for purposes of staging for counterterrorism and counter-piracy operations in the vicinity of the Horn of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, and to provide contingency support for embassy security augmentation in East Africa, as necessary.<br><br><strong>Lake Chad Basin and Sahel Region.</strong>&nbsp; United States military personnel in the Lake Chad Basin and Sahel Region continue to conduct airborne intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance operations and to provide support to African and European partners conducting counterterrorism operations in the region, including by advising, assisting, and accompanying these partner forces.&nbsp; Approximately 808 United States military personnel remain deployed to Niger.<br><br><strong>Cuba.&nbsp; </strong>United States Armed Forces continue to conduct humane and&nbsp;secure detention operations for detainees held at Guantanamo&nbsp;Bay, Cuba, under the authority provided by the 2001&nbsp;Authorization for the Use of Military Force (Public Law&nbsp;107-40), as informed by the law of war.&nbsp; There are 40&nbsp;such&nbsp;detainees as of the date of this report.<br><br><strong>Philippines.&nbsp; </strong>United States Armed Forces deployed to the Philippines are providing support to the counterterrorism operations of the armed forces of the Philippines.<br><br>MILITARY OPERATIONS IN EGYPT IN SUPPORT OF THE MULTINATIONAL FORCE AND OBSERVERS<br><br>Approximately 379 United States military personnel are assigned&nbsp;to or supporting the United States contingent of the&nbsp;Multinational Force and Observers, which have been present in&nbsp;Egypt since 1981.<br><br>UNITED STATES AND NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY ORGANIZATION OPERATIONS IN KOSOVO<br><br>The United States continues to contribute forces to the Kosovo Force (KFOR), led by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in cooperation with local authorities, bilateral partners, and international institutions, to deter renewed hostilities in Kosovo.&nbsp; Approximately 707 United States military personnel are&nbsp;among KFOR&#8217;s approximately 4,000 personnel.<br><br>I have directed the participation of United States Armed Forces in all of the above-described operations pursuant to my&nbsp;constitutional and statutory authority as Commander in Chief and as Chief Executive (including the authority to carry out Public Law 107-40, Public Law 107-243, and other statutes), as well as my constitutional and statutory authority to conduct the&nbsp;foreign relations of the United States.&nbsp; Officials of my Administration and I communicate regularly with congressional leadership, relevant congressional committees, and other Members of Congress with regard to these deployments, and we will continue to do so.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-right">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sincerely,<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.</p>

(Mac) Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 (Public Law 116-283), I&nbsp;have&nbsp;determined that a waiver of the limitation under subsection 1215(a) is important to the national security interests of the&nbsp;United States.<br><br>As I announced on April 14, 2021, after almost 20 years, it is&nbsp;time to end America&#8217;s longest war and bring our troops home.&nbsp; I&nbsp;reached this conclusion after conducting a rigorous policy review process and consulting closely with our allies and partners, with our military leaders and intelligence personnel, with our diplomats and our development experts, with the Congress and the Vice President, and with the President of Afghanistan and many other leaders around the world.<br><br>We went to Afghanistan in 2001 for a clear and just purpose:&nbsp; to&nbsp;apprehend those who attacked our country on September 11, 2001; to root out al-Qa&#8217;ida; and to prevent future attacks against the United States from Afghanistan.&nbsp; As a Senator, I&nbsp;supported sending our military to Afghanistan for those reasons.&nbsp; Our original mission had overwhelming support in the&nbsp;Congress and our allies and partners rallied to our side and&nbsp;stood with us in Afghanistan.<br><br>We have long since accomplished the objectives that sent us to Afghanistan.&nbsp; It has been 10 years since we delivered justice to&nbsp;Osama bin Laden.&nbsp; The terrorist threat from al-Qa&#8217;ida in Afghanistan is significantly degraded.<br><br>Over the last 20 years, however, the terrorist threat to the United States has become more dispersed around the globe.&nbsp; Keeping thousands of troops concentrated on the ground in Afghanistan no longer makes sense as the most effective counterterrorism strategy when the threat has metastasized across the Middle East, Africa, and Asia.&nbsp; Our focus and posture&nbsp;need to adapt accordingly.<br><br>As we draw down United States troops, we will not take our eye off the&nbsp;terrorist threat in Afghanistan.&nbsp; The United States will reorganize our counterterrorism capabilities and assets in the region to prevent the reemergence of a terrorist threat in Afghanistan.&nbsp; We will hold the Taliban and the Afghan government accountable to their commitments not to allow terrorists to threaten the United&nbsp;States or its allies from Afghan soil. &nbsp;And we will refine our national strategy to monitor and disrupt terrorist threats wherever they arise.<br><br>Over the past few decades, the United States and our partners have trained hundreds of thousands of Afghan troops. &nbsp;The Afghan National Defense and Security Forces currently number close to 300,000, and they will continue to fight valiantly to protect the Afghan citizens. &nbsp;With the support of the Congress, we will continue to support the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces. &nbsp;We will also continue to support the rights of Afghan women and girls and to maintain significant humanitarian and development assistance to Afghanistan.<br><br>We will continue to pursue diplomacy and fully support peace talks between the Government of Afghanistan and the Taliban, facilitated by the United Nations.&nbsp; And we will encourage other nations in the region, especially Pakistan, to do more to support Afghanistan and to support stability in the country.&nbsp; But we will not allow United States troops to be a bargaining chip between warring parties in other countries.&nbsp; That is a recipe for staying indefinitely in Afghanistan.&nbsp;<br><br>We will withdraw responsibly, deliberately, and safely, in full coordination with our allies and partners.&nbsp; Our NATO allies and operational partners, who have stood shoulder-to-shoulder with us for almost 20 years and who have also made great sacrifices, will now withdraw alongside our forces as we stand by our enduring principle of &#8220;in together, out together.&#8221;<br><br>Finally, I want to acknowledge the tremendous debt of gratitude we owe as a Nation to the women and men who have served honorably in Afghanistan since 2001.&nbsp; They and their families have made incredible sacrifices for our Nation that we can never fully repay. I look forward to working with the Congress to continue supporting our forces and veterans and on countering the challenges our Nation faces across the globe.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>On June 16, 2006, by Executive Order 13405, the President declared a national emergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 <em>et seq</em>.) to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States constituted by the actions and policies of certain members of the Government of&nbsp;Belarus and other persons to undermine Belarus&#8217;s democratic processes or institutions, manifested in the fundamentally undemocratic March 2006 elections; to commit human rights abuses related to political repression, including detentions and disappearances; and to engage in public corruption, including by diverting or misusing Belarusian public assets or by misusing public authority.</p>



<p>The actions and policies of certain members of the Government of Belarus and other persons continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.&nbsp; For this reason, the national emergency declared on June 16, 2006, must continue in effect beyond June 16, 2021.&nbsp; Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13405.</p>



<p>This notice shall be published in the <em>Federal&nbsp;Register </em>and transmitted to the Congress.</p>

<p>Dear Madam Speaker: (Dear Madam President:)<br><br>Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, within 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President publishes in the <em>Federal Register</em> and transmits to the Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the anniversary date. &nbsp;In accordance with this provision, I have sent to the <em>Federal Register</em> for publication the enclosed notice stating that the national emergency with respect to the actions and policies of certain members of the Government of Belarus and other persons to undermine democratic processes or institutions of Belarus that was declared in Executive Order 13405 of June&nbsp;16, 2006, is&nbsp;to continue in effect beyond June 16, 2021.<br><br>The actions and policies of certain members of the Government of&nbsp;Belarus and other persons to undermine Belarus&#8217;s democratic processes or institutions, to commit human rights abuses related to political repression, and to engage in public corruption continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat&nbsp;to the national security and foreign policy of the United&nbsp;States. &nbsp;Therefore, I have determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13405 with respect to Belarus.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>Dear Madam Speaker: (Dear Madam President:)<br><br>Pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50&nbsp;U.S.C. 1701 <em>et seq.</em>), I hereby report that I have issued an&nbsp;Executive Order in order to expand the scope of the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13219 of June 26, 2001 (Blocking Property of Persons Who Threaten International Stabilization Efforts in the Western Balkans), as amended by&nbsp;Executive Order 13304 of May 28, 2003 (Termination of Emergencies With Respect to Yugoslavia and Modification of Executive Order 13219 of June 26, 2001), finding that the situation in the territory of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Republic of Albania (the Western Balkans), over the past two decades, including the undermining of post-war agreements and institutions following the breakup of&nbsp;the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, as well&nbsp;as widespread corruption within various governments and institutions in the Western Balkans, stymies progress toward effective and democratic governance and full integration into transatlantic institutions, and thereby constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.<br><br>The order broadens the geographic scope of the existing sanctions regime to include Albania and augments designation criteria for current threats to United States national security and foreign policy interests in the region, including obstruction of&nbsp;democratic and judicial processes, corruption, and organized crime.&nbsp;<br><br>Actions undermining post-war agreements and institutions following the breakup of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, as well as widespread corruption within various governments and institutions in the Western Balkans, stymies progress toward effective and democratic governance and full integration into transatlantic institutions, and thereby constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.&nbsp; I have therefore determined that it is necessary to block the property and interests in property of any persons who are determined by&nbsp;the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to have undermined democratic processes or&nbsp;institutions, undermined any regional security, peace, cooperation, or mutual recognition agreement or framework or accountability mechanism, engaged in serious human rights abuse, or directly or indirectly engaged in corruption related to the Western Balkans.&nbsp; All executive departments and agencies are directed to take all appropriate measures within their authority to carry out the provisions of the order.<br><br>I am enclosing a copy of the Executive Order I have issued.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-right">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sincerely,<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.</p>
