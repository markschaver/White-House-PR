<ul><li>USAID will provide up to $40 million over three years to launch the Young Women’s Empowerment Initiative that will focus on creating opportunities for young, primarily indigenous women, who face substantial gender gaps.&nbsp; Activities will strengthen efforts to prevent and combat pervasive gender-based violence and trafficking in persons from areas of high out-migration while increasing access to justice, education and economic opportunities, and health and social services.&nbsp;</li></ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>Today, the Department of Justice will file a brief in the Supreme Court in the case <em>United States v. Vaello-Madero</em>, which addresses whether a provision in the Social Security Act that declines to provide Puerto Rico residents with Supplemental Security Income (SSI) violates the Constitution’s equal protection principle.<br><br>This provision is inconsistent with my Administration’s policies and values. However, the Department of Justice has a longstanding practice of defending the constitutionality of federal statutes, regardless of policy preferences. This practice is critical to the Department’s mission of preserving the rule of law. Consistent with this important practice, the Department is defending the constitutionality of the Social Security Act provision in this case.<br><br>As I have stated, I believe that Puerto Rico residents should be able to receive SSI benefits, just like their fellow Americans in all 50 states and Washington D.C. I call on Congress to amend the Social Security Act to extend these benefits to residents of Puerto Rico. And as I reiterated in my first budget request, I also support eliminating Medicaid funding caps for Puerto Rico and moving toward parity for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to align with States. These steps, along with the American Rescue Plan, which included an enhanced Child Tax Credit for families and a permanent federal match expansion to the Earned Income Tax Credit program, will provide families in Puerto Rico an equal chance to get ahead. As I’ve said before, there can be no second-class citizens in the United States of America. My Administration will work with members of Congress to make these legislative fixes a reality.</p>

<p>As appropriate given the independence of the Justice Department in specific criminal cases, no one at the White House was aware of the gag order until Friday night. While the White House does not intervene in criminal investigations, the issuing of subpoenas for the records of reporters in leak investigations is not consistent with the President’s policy direction to the Department, and the Department of Justice has reconfirmed it will not be used moving forward.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Forty years ago today, five young men in Los Angeles were confirmed as the first known patients stricken with an illness that the world would later come to know as AIDS.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>Forty years ago today, five young men in Los Angeles were confirmed as the first known patients stricken with an illness that the world would later come to know as AIDS. In the decades since, more than 700,000 Americans and 32.7 million people worldwide have been lost to AIDS-related illnesses – a heartbreaking human toll that has disproportionately devastated LGBTQ+ communities, communities of color, and underserved and marginalized people around the world.</p>



<p>On the 40th year of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, we remember the lives that were cut short by this terrible disease – including so many whose pain went unacknowledged for far too long. We also celebrate the resilience and dignity of the over 38 million people worldwide, including approximately 1.2 million Americans, living with HIV.</p>



<p>Thanks to the tireless dedication of activists, scientific researchers, and medical professionals, we have made tremendous progress to advance HIV research, prevention, treatment, and care. And after years of neglect, discrimination, fear-mongering, and limited action by government officials and the public, America has grown to become a leading force in the fight to end the HIV crisis. Through the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief – and as the largest donor to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria – the U.S. has invested more than $85 billion since 2002 to support HIV programs around the world, including $250 million provided in my American Rescue Plan to address the impacts of COVID-19 on our progress in the fight against HIV. All told, these efforts are estimated to have saved more than 20 million lives globally. To help accelerate and strengthen our efforts to end the HIV epidemic in the United States, I have requested $670 million from Congress, an increase of $267 million over previous levels, to aggressively reduce new HIV cases by increasing access to treatment, expanding the use of preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP), and ensuring equitable access to services free from stigma and discrimination.</p>



<p>Despite the progress we’ve made, our work is not yet finished. In honor of all those we have lost and all those living with the virus – and the selfless caregivers, advocates, and loved ones who have helped carry the burden of this crisis – we must rededicate ourselves to reducing HIV infections and AIDS-related deaths. We must continue empowering researchers, scientists, and health care providers to ensure equitable access to prevention, care, and treatment in every community – particularly for communities of color and the LGBTQ+ community. And we must provide moral leadership to eradicate the stigma and discrimination still faced by those living with HIV, rededicating ourselves to continuing the vital work of ending this epidemic once and for all.</p>

<p>The President spoke to Senator Shelley Moore Capito and Chairman Peter DeFazio today.</p>



<p>Senator Capito conveyed to the President a new offer from her group which consisted of an about $50 billion increase in spending across a number of infrastructure programs. The President expressed his gratitude for her effort and goodwill, but also indicated that the current offer did not meet his objectives to grow the economy, tackle the climate crisis, and create new jobs. He indicated to Senator Capito that he would continue to engage a number of Senators in both parties in the hopes of achieving a more substantial package. They agreed to speak again on Monday.</p>



<p>The President also spoke to Chairman DeFazio to thank him for all his hard work on key elements of the American Jobs Plan, and to offer his support for the Committee mark-up that Chairman DeFazio will begin on Wednesday. The President and Chairman DeFazio agreed on the benefits of continued engagement with Democratic and Republican Senators as the House work on infrastructure advances this coming week.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Rehoboth Beach Convention Center<br>Rehoboth Beach, Delaware</p>



<p>10:38 A.M. EDT<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Hello, folks.&nbsp; Good morning.&nbsp; Today, we received great news for our economy and our recovery and for the American people.&nbsp;<br><br>This morning, we learned that, in May, our economy created 559,000 new jobs, unemployment rate fell to 5.8 percent, and wages went up for American workers.&nbsp; That means we have now created over 2 million jobs in total since I took office &#8212; more jobs than have ever been created in the first four months of any presidency in modern history, triple the rate of my predecessor, eight times the rate of President Reagan.<br><br>The unemployment rate is now below 6 percent for the first time since the pandemic hit.&nbsp; The first 14 months &#8212; first time &#8212; first time in 14 months, we saw the largest decline in the number of long-term unemployed, more &#8212; in more than an entire decade, in the last 10 years.<br><br>Long-term unemployment dropped by the second largest amount ever recorded.&nbsp; Not only that, but the signs of further progress are already here.&nbsp;<br><br>This report is based on a weekly &#8212; a week in early May.&nbsp; That&#8217;s how we &#8212; they determine the &#8212; the job rate &#8212; growth or loss; we have growth.&nbsp; And that &#8212; and this &#8212; that week in May, we only had 35 percent of working-age adults had been fully vaccinated.&nbsp; Now we&#8217;re still all &#8212; they were still all wearing masks.&nbsp;<br><br>Since then, 21 million more adults have gotten vaccinated, making it easy for them to return to work safely.&nbsp; In short, this is progress &#8212; historic progress.&nbsp; Progress that&#8217;s pulling our economy out of the worst crisis it&#8217;s been in 100 years.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s testament to the new strategy that is growing this economy, not only growing it, but growing it from the bottom up and the middle out.<br><br>Remember, when I took office in January, our economy was in a tailspin, job growth had stalled, COVID was raging, average initial claims for unemployment insurance were over 830,000 per week.&nbsp; Now those claims have fallen below 430,000 &#8212; about half of what they were when I took office.&nbsp;<br><br>Before I took office, almost 24 million Americans were going hungry.&nbsp; Remember those long lines of cars, miles long, people waiting for just a box of food to be put in their trunk?&nbsp; That number has already dropped by 25 percent.&nbsp; Still too many, but clear progress.<br><br>Before I took office, independent experts were projecting that the American economy would grow by 3 or 4 percent in 2021 &#8212; this year.&nbsp; This week, the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development &#8212; the so-called OECD, which makes up a group that includes the world&#8217;s largest economies in its membership and has been one of the meeting body&#8217;s analyzing economic growth worldwide in individual nations &#8212; increased their projection for U.S. economic growth this year to 6.9 percent in 2021.&nbsp; That&#8217;s the fastest pace in nearly four decades.&nbsp;<br><br>In fact, the U.S. is the only major economy where projections of future growth are stronger today than they were before the pandemic hit in 2020. &nbsp;<br><br>And in May, manufacturing activity was nearly as strong as it was in more than 15 years &#8212; stronger than in 15 years.&nbsp; No other major econo- &#8212; major economy in the world is growing as fast as ours.&nbsp; No other major economy is gaining jobs as quickly as ours.&nbsp;<br><br>And none of this success is an accident; it isn&#8217;t luck.&nbsp; It&#8217;s due in no small part, first of all, to the cooperation of the American people in responding to my effort to get COVID under control &#8212; wearing masks initially and getting vaccinated.&nbsp;<br><br>And it&#8217;s no small part to the bold action we took by passing the American Rescue Plan.&nbsp; The plan provided those resources to get shots in people&#8217;s arms; underwrite the vaccination effort; enough vaccine supply for every single American; more vaccinators, people to put shots in the arms; and more vaccination sites.&nbsp;<br><br>And now, 52 percent &#8212; 52 percent of American adults are fully vaccinated.&nbsp; 75 percent of our seniors are fully vaccinated.&nbsp; And the American Rescue pan [sic] &#8212; Plan delivered economic benefits directly to the American people.&nbsp;<br><br>Because of that law, more than 167 million of those Rescue payments of up to $1,400 have gone out to individual families.&nbsp; A recent study &#8212; the Census Bureau data found just how much these checks mattered.&nbsp; They drastically reluced [sic] &#8212; reduced depression &#8212; according to study &#8212; anxiety, and hardship for families.&nbsp; More than 40 percent fewer families struggled to afford food, rent, utilities, car payments, student loans, and healthcare expenses.<br><br>Small businesses and restaurants are &#8212; were getting killed.&nbsp; Now we&#8217;re delivering loans and support they need to reopen and to stay open.<br><br>Schools are struggling to reopen, so we made vaccinating teachers a priority.&nbsp; We delivered schools the much support they needed.&nbsp; State and local governments had to lay off tens of thousands of educators and first responders.&nbsp; Many are now back on the job, thanks to the Rescue Plan.&nbsp;<br><br>In fact, in May, state and local governments added 103,000 education jobs &#8212; returned them to work.&nbsp; These funds are continuing to get out this month to support state and local governments, which will help get more people back to work.<br><br>Small- and medium-sized businesses are now able to take advantage of a special tax credit called the “Employee Retention Tax Credit.”&nbsp; It provides businesses a generous tax credit to retain or hire more workers.&nbsp;<br><br>Through our Restaurant Revitalization Fund, we anticipate being able to help over 100,000 hard-hit restaurants stay open or reopen.&nbsp;<br><br>And beginning next month, most families with children will be getting a tax cut, which will be going into &#8212; deposited into their accounts &#8212; directly into their bank accounts every month.&nbsp;<br><br>We know that access to childcare is one of the biggest barriers in the way of parents going back to work.&nbsp; Our administration is delivering $39 billion in childcare relief to help childcare providers get back on their feet &#8212; the providers &#8212; and serve more families.<br><br>And this month, our economy added nearly 20,000 more childcare jobs that weren&#8217;t there last month &#8212; in fact, allowing parents to have access to get help.<br><br>And temporary boost in unemployment benefits that ended &#8212; that we enacted, I should say &#8212; helped people who lost their jobs through no fault of their own, and who still may be in the process of getting vaccinated.&nbsp; But it&#8217;s going to expire in 90 days.&nbsp; That makes sense it expires in 90 days.<br><br>To sum it up: Look, COVID cases are down, COVID deaths are up [down], unemployment filings are down, hunger is down, and vaccinations are up, jobs are up, wages are up, manufacturing is up, growth is up, people gaining healthcare coverage is up, and small business confidence is up. &nbsp;<br><br>America is finally on the move again.&nbsp; As we continue this recovery, we&#8217;re going to hit some bumps along the way.&nbsp; Of course, that will happen.&nbsp; We can&#8217;t reboot the world&#8217;s largest economy like flipping on a ni- &#8212; light switch.&nbsp;<br><br>There&#8217;s going to be ups and downs in jobs and economic reports, but we&#8217;re going to be &#8212; supply chain issues and price pressures on the way back to stability and steady growth.<br><br>In the coming weeks, my administration is going to take steps to combat these supply constraints, building on the work we&#8217;re doing on the computer chips; that is, we&#8217;re providing more computer chips to be manufactured here in the United States so it doesn&#8217;t slow up the manufacturing of automobiles, for example.<br><br>Everyone needs to get their shots though.&nbsp; Now is the time to accelerate the <s>process</s> [progress] we’ve been making.&nbsp; Now is the time to build on the foundation we&#8217;ve laid, because while progress is undeniable, it is not assured.&nbsp;<br><br>That&#8217;s why I proposed the American Jobs Plan and the American Family Plan for generational investments we need today.&nbsp; We need to make those investments today to be able to continue to succeed tomorrow.<br><br>We have a chance to seize on the economic momentum of the first months of my administration, not just to build back, but to build back better.&nbsp;<br><br>This much is already clear: We&#8217;re on the right track. &nbsp;Our plan is working.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re not going to let up now.&nbsp; We&#8217;re going to continue to move on.&nbsp; I&#8217;m extremely optimistic.&nbsp; I hope you are as well.&nbsp;<br><br>And may God bless you, may God bless America, and may God protect our troops. &nbsp;Thank you all for being here this morning. &nbsp;Thank you.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; President Biden, do you have (inaudible) on the infrastructure talks?&nbsp;<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; I’m going to be having a talk this afternoon, and I’ll be able to report to you after that.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are you expecting a counteroffer, Mr. President?<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; I’ll tell you after I meet this afternoon.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. President, do you still have confidence in Dr. Fauci?<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Yes, I’m very confident in Dr. Fauci.<br><br>10:48 A.M.

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>By: Deputy National Security Advisor Daleep Singh</em></p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>My story is the story of so many other Indian Americans. In search of a better life for their kids – and maybe a bit of adventure for themselves &#8211; my parents left India for America in the 1970s. I was born in Maryland, spent a few years in Chicago, and settled in North Carolina when I was about seven years old.</p>



<p>I’ve always described my childhood as a happy one. Surrounded by a loving family, I felt like I was part of something bigger than myself, and that my life meant something to those around me. I also felt enormous pride and gratitude in being an American – having the freedom to find and become my authentic self, and the opportunity to dream big, even if in my case these were mostly athletic delusions.</p>



<p>At a young age, I also knew that we were different. I remember on the first day we arrived in Raleigh, our apartment was filled with unopened boxes. But instead of unpacking, my parents grabbed the phone book, found three Indian-sounding last names, and invited them over for dinner. All of them arrived within hours and, from that point on, we probably shared at least one weekend meal within the Indian community until I went away for college.</p>



<p>As I got older, I began to understand how much these gatherings meant. Like anyone else, my parents wanted a space where their traditions and beliefs were accepted, and that hadn’t always been their experience. When he first moved to the U.S., my dad &#8211; a turbaned Sikh &#8211; was told by his boss: if he wanted to keep his job, he’d need to fit in better. So that’s what my dad did – he sacrificed part of his identity to provide for his family. Meanwhile, my mom worked for the Raleigh city government, and I’ll never forget her coming home in tears after her boss openly bragged that he was a member of the KKK. He made sure to remind her of that throughout her years of dedicated but painful service in Raleigh city government.</p>



<p>I also wanted to feel accepted, but for that to happen as a kid it sometimes involved compromises that I now regret. I remember feeling dread in middle school whenever we’d have a substitute teacher, knowing they would butcher my name, and giving the whole class a good laugh at my expense. Sometimes I thought the solution was to just own it, so I’d speak during class with a thick Indian accent. When I think about that now, I’m ashamed. I made a joke out of my family’s background to deal with my own insecurity about being different.<br>Fast forwarding to the past few years, the rise in hateful attacks against Asian Americans and other communities of color made me realize that I was still carrying a lot of memories – painful ones – that felt heavier over the years. I’d almost forgotten the humiliation of getting beat up on the back of an elementary school bus for being the “dirty brown kid with smelly food,” or what it felt like to get told I couldn’t go on a date with someone in high school because I’m brown.</p>



<p>Much of the reason I’d been able to let these memories go was my deeply held belief that things were getting better when it came to race; that my kids would grow up in a different way. So I’ll admit, the slow progress and setbacks left me angry at times. I suspect many in the Indian American community feel the same way: we’re tired of watching the past repeat itself, and we’re exhausted from being quiet.</p>



<p>But to make change, we first have to recognize that we can all do better, myself included. That means being real about my own privilege as an Indian American from a middle-class household. I’m not at risk of being stopped and frisked. My wife and I don’t have to teach our kids how to survive if they get pulled over by the police. For those of us who’ve faced prejudice, we also need to check own our bias, and see our own privileges, if we’re going to do better.</p>



<p>It also means we need to speak out and do our part if we’re going to be seen as 100%, full-fledged, just-like-you citizens. As an Asian American, I’m deeply humbled and honored to have the privilege of serving in President Biden’s administration at a defining moment in our country’s history, while being a part of the most diverse administration ever assembled. My experience serving our country bears no resemblance to my mom’s days in Raleigh city government, but her experience back then, and recent violence toward Asian Americans, are a constant reminder to me about the responsibility I have of representing and standing up for the AAPI community every day in this job.</p>



<p>My role at the White House is to help create a self-reinforcing dynamic between domestic renewal, American leadership abroad, and national security. Part of domestic renewal has to do with economics: creating sustained and inclusive growth in jobs and wages, boosting the resilience of our critical supply chains, and strengthening our innovative edge. Another part of domestic renewal involves healing the wounds of racial injustice and coming together as a society to deliver on American’s unmatched promise. I don’t have direct policy responsibility in this area, but it’s central to what President Biden is trying to deliver, and a big reason why I’m here.</p>



<p>As a final thought, I want to use this platform to send love and support to my sisters and brothers in the Sikh community who have been a particular target of harassment, racism, and violence in recent years. I stand with them today and always.</p>
