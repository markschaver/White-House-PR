<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>The Westin Grand Munich<br>Munich, Germany</em></p>



<p>11:18 A.M. CEST</p>



<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Well, this was an important trip to be here at the Munich Security Conference &#8212; in particular this year, as I said yesterday.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We are looking at a moment that is a very decisive moment on one of the bases for the Munich Security Conference and certainly one of the founding reasons for NATO, which is European security and the connection and alliance between Europe and the United States.</p>



<p>This was a productive trip, in terms of the extensive bilateral meetings that we had that were in furtherance of the ongoing collaboration and partnership with our Allies. &nbsp;</p>



<p>It was important in that, as you all know, this is a moment that is very dynamic.&nbsp; If not every hour, certainly every day, there seem to be new moments of interest and also of intelligence.&nbsp;<br><br>And so we have affirmed, however &#8212; all of that being said &#8212; through these last couple of days, that this Alliance is strong &#8212; probably stronger than it was before; and &#8212; and that this Alliance has purpose and meaning founded on shared principles that are very much at play right now.&nbsp; And as I mentioned yesterday, if we think about those principles, one of the most important is about a mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, which at its essence is what is at play in terms of Russia&#8217;s posture as it relates to Ukraine.<br><br>At stake is the NATO Alliance, in terms of our unity, joining together &#8212; through, sometimes, compromise; certainly always through collaboration &#8212; to be a unified voice, especially when these very founding principles of our relationship are being compromised, if not attacked.</p>



<p>So, with that, I’ll take any questions you have.</p>



<p>AIDE:&nbsp; And I’ll call on folks.&nbsp; So, Nandita from Reuters.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Madam Vice President.&nbsp; During your meeting with President Zelenskyy, he spoke a little bit about asking the U.S. for specific defense aid.&nbsp; Could you talk a little bit about what he asked the United States for and what the U.S. has agreed to offer?</p>



<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; Well, I&#8217;ll tell you what I think you already know: So far, we have offered &#8212; not even offered, we have &#8212; we have transferred and given $650 million in aid.&nbsp; We have also made certain loan guarantees around, in particular, $1 billion.<br><br>And that is on top of all of the work that we have done collectively through the NATO Alliance to provide support for Ukraine.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there anything new that you are planning to offer Ukraine?</p>



<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Well, what I made clear in our meeting and &#8212; is that &#8212; again, this is a dynamic situation.&nbsp; And depending on what happens in the coming days, we will reevaluate the need that Ukraine has and our ability to support.&nbsp; And we have been doing that through the course of these many months.</p>



<p>AIDE:&nbsp; Let&#8217;s go to Molly from ABC.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Madam Vice President.&nbsp; I wanted to ask you, first, are you going to take part in that NSC meeting &#8212;</p>



<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Yes.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; today?</p>



<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Yes.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You are going to take part in that?</p>



<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Yes.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then I wanted to follow up on your meeting with President Zelenskyy yesterday.&nbsp;</p>



<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Okay.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he spoke after your meeting, he shared his frustration with countries like the U.S. who say that a attack is likely to happen in Ukraine but that you won&#8217;t put sanctions in place until that happens.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You &#8212; the administration has continually said that retaining those sanctions holds on to some leverage.&nbsp; But if you believe Putin has made up his mind, what leverage do you really have?&nbsp; Why not put those sanctions in place now?<br><br>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; The purpose of the sanctions has always been and continues to be deterrence.&nbsp; But let&#8217;s also recognize the unique nature of the sanctions that we have outlined.</p>



<p>These are some of the greatest sanctions, if not the strongest, that we&#8217;ve ever issued.&nbsp; As I articulated yesterday, it is directed at institutions &#8212; in particular, financial institutions &#8212; and individuals, and it will exact absolute harm for the Russian economy and their government.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But if Putin has made up his mind, do you feel that this threat that has been looming is really going to deter him?<br><br>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Absolut- &#8212; we strongly believe &#8212; and remember also that the sanctions are a product not only of our perspective as the United States but a shared perspective among our Allies.&nbsp; And the Allied relationship is such that we have agreed that the deterrence effect of these sanctions is still a meaningful one, especially because &#8212; remember, also &#8212; we still sincerely hope that there is a diplomatic path out of this moment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And within the context then of the fact that that window is still opening, altho- &#8212; open, although it is absolutely narrowing &#8212; but within the context of a diplomatic path still being open, the deterrence effect, we believe, has merit.</p>



<p>AIDE:&nbsp; Let&#8217;s go to Jennifer Jacobs from Bloomberg.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Would you be willing to talk a little bit about how the U.S. would get out of this potential conflict with Russia?&nbsp; What is the endgame?&nbsp; How does the U.S. &#8212; after imposing some of these sanctions and possible military action, how does the U.S. disentangle from this?<br><br>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; I would characterize it differently.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t &#8212; we don&#8217;t consider ourselves to be entangled.&nbsp; But we&#8217;re very clear of our principles and our purpose, which is to be aligned with our Allies, understanding that &#8212; I mean, listen, guys, we&#8217;re talking about the potential for war in Europe.<br><br>I mean, let&#8217;s really take a moment to understand the significance of what we&#8217;re talking about.&nbsp; It’s been over 70 years.&nbsp; And through those 70 years, as I mentioned yesterday, there has been peace and security.&nbsp; We are talking about the real possibility of war in Europe.<br><br>So our position is, for us, very clear, which is as a leader &#8212; which we have been, bringing together the Allies, working together around our collective and unified position &#8212; that we would all not just prefer, we desire, we believe it is in the best interest of all that there is a diplomatic end to this moment.&nbsp; And so where do we want this to end?&nbsp; That is where we want it to end.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What should Americans be braced for?&nbsp; What could they possibly be facing?&nbsp; The President has already said Americans will be facing some economic fallout or some hardships.&nbsp; Can you explain to Americans what exactly will they face if this happened?</p>



<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; As the President talked about in his speech, we are aware that, again, when America stands for her principles and all of the things that we hold dear, it requires sometimes for us to put ourselves out there in a way that maybe we will incur some cost.&nbsp; And in this situation, that may relate to energy costs, for example.&nbsp; But we are taking very specific and appropriate, I believe, steps to mitigate what that cost might be if it happens.</p>



<p>AIDE:&nbsp; Let’s go to Eli at the Los Angeles Times.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Madam Vice President.&nbsp; A question about something else that President Zelenskyy said yesterday relating to NATO.&nbsp; He seemed to question the sincerity of Allies, including the U.S., I think, in terms of a desire to admit Ukraine to NATO.&nbsp; Is there any &#8212; is there any reaction to those pretty pointed comments from the President?&nbsp; And was that something that was discussed with Chancellor Scholz and other leaders?<br><br>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Let me start by saying I appreciate and admire President Zelenskyy’s desire to join NATO.&nbsp; And one of, again, the founding principles of NATO is that each country must have the ability &#8212; unimpaired, unimpeded &#8212; to determine their own future, both in terms of their form of government and, in this case, whether they desire to be a member of NATO.<br><br>And I&#8217;ll put that in context, because the obvious is also the point, which is that: and therefore no other country can tell anyone whether they should or should not join NATO.&nbsp; That should be their independent choice.&nbsp; That is the point of sovereignty.&nbsp; So I respect President Zelenskyy’s desire to be a member of NATO.&nbsp;</p>



<p>NATO is a membership.&nbsp; It is about nations coming together as a group, making decisions collectively around, again, principles and what will be, then, the conditions and &#8212; and the standards of membership.&nbsp; And so that is the process.</p>



<p>It doesn&#8217;t happen overnight.  No one country can say “I want to be, and therefore I will be.”  And no one country can say &#8220;You can&#8217;t be.&#8221;  And isn&#8217;t that at the heart of the very issue we’re presented with in terms of Russia&#8217;s aggression, or stated aggression, toward Ukraine?</p>



<p>Q    Was it surprising to you, though, that he planted that flag so firmly on that issue &#8212; given that that&#8217;s obviously Putin&#8217;s main demand, is that he gets some sort of guarantee, swearing that Ukraine won&#8217;t be admitted &#8212; that Zelenskyy wants to make it clear that they do want to enter the organization?  Was that a surprise that he would come and say that at this point in this crisis?  And does that make it less likely that there&#8217;ll be some sort of diplomatic resolution?<br><br>THE VICE PRESIDENT:  I&#8217;m not going to second guess President Zelenskyy’s desires for his own country.  But I will say this: Let us recognize the position he is in right now.  His country is virtually surrounded by Russian troops.  I believe he came here &#8212; this is my belief, based on just my own assessment and speculation &#8212; he came here to make a very clear point that he does not stand alone.<br></p>



<p>In fact, I told him in our meeting, “The United States stands with you.”  Because we do, as do this community of Allies and partners.</p>



<p>So I understand where he &#8212; why he came here.  And I would not second guess &#8212; I will not second guess why he spoke the words he speaks.<br></p>



<p>He&#8217;s in a position, again, where his country is virtually surrounded by what &#8212; by, I think most reasonable people would believe, hostile troops.<br></p>



<p>AIDE:  Let’s go to Aamer at The AP, please.</p>



<p>Q    Thank you, Madam Vice President.  So Daleep Singh said late last week that SWIFT sanctions probably won&#8217;t be part of the opening gambit if sanctions go forward.  Considering the administration saying early and often that you&#8217;re going to stay high &#8212; start high and stay high, how does that square?  How can you start high and stay high without SWIFT sanctions in the package?<br><br>THE VICE PRESIDENT:  We&#8217;re going to take this one moment at a time in terms of what might need to happen in the future in terms of escalation.  But right now, we&#8217;ve made our position clear.</p>



<p>AIDE:&nbsp; And last question, let&#8217;s go to Natasha at CNN.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Madam Vice President.&nbsp; I&#8217;m wondering whether the U.S. has evidence that Putin has actually given the order to his subordinates to launch an attack and whether that intelligence and that evidence is shared and agreed upon by the Allies here &#8212; and that includes Zelenskyy, who has been skeptical of this kind of intelligence in the past.</p>



<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; As the President has said, we believe that Putin has made his decision.&nbsp; Period.&nbsp; And &#8212; but I will also say that, as part of our relationship and partnership, in &#8212; in the context of the Alliance, we do share information, certainly, because we want to make sure that we are all working with the same information when we make these very critical and meaningful decisions &#8212; the last question about sanctions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I said it yesterday on the stage: Everybody didn&#8217;t agree at the beginning about what the consequences should be if Russia re-invades Ukraine.&nbsp; We had to meet.&nbsp; We had to discuss it.&nbsp; Because each of these nations &#8212; I mean, I spe- &#8212; I spent time &#8212; a considerable amount of time with the Chancellor of Germany yesterday.&nbsp; I &#8212; I spent time with the President of the EU yesterday.&nbsp; When we look at the significance of these sanctions, they are immense.&nbsp;<br><br>And so, all nations who are a part of this understand that we cannot take lightly or speak lightly about what we are prepared to do, because we do understand the cost we are exacting, and it is severe.<br><br>So we have had these discussions, again, through a process.&nbsp; We have arrived at this place.&nbsp; And &#8212; and back to the last question, we will, obviously, reassess depending on how the days, weeks, and months ahead roll out.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And do you believe &#8212;</p>



<p>AIDE:&nbsp; Thank you all.</p>



<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; But &#8212; just go on.&nbsp; You can go to the follow-up (inaudible).</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was just going to ask: Do you believe that the U.S. and Ukraine are now more on the same page about what the intelligence suggests than they have been in the past?</p>



<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; I can tell you that there has been direct communication about the intelligence, so nothing is being held back.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vice President, the Prime Minister of Italy does not agree with all of the sanctions plans.&nbsp; He said yesterday that he does not feel that energy should be sanctioned.&nbsp; Does that not undercut U.S. efforts to impose tough, painful, severe financial sanctions?</p>



<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; As I&#8217;ve said, this is an alliance of nations that each have their priorities and their &#8212; their individual concerns about how anything we do going forward will impact their specific country, their economy, and their security.&nbsp;<br><br>So, again, I would not deny Italy from having its perspective or its list of concerns; we all do, actually.&nbsp; That has been part of this process.&nbsp; And so Italy is very much at the table in terms of these conversations about how we can do this in a way that achieves its intended purpose, which &#8212; back to the earlier point &#8212; is about deterring Russia from invading a sovereign nation.<br><br>And we all understand, including every country in Europe, what war in Europe looks like and what it can mean for the citizens of each of those countries.</p>



<p>Thank you.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Commerzbank Filiale München<br>Munich, Germany</em></p>



<p>2:12 P.M. CEST<br><br>VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:&nbsp; I&#8217;m looking forward to our conversation.&nbsp;As you know, this is a decisive moment in our world&#8217;s history.&nbsp;And this is an important meeting for that and many other reasons.</p>



<p>I look forward, in this discussion, to hearing directly from you about the situation on the ground in Ukraine.&nbsp; I look forward to, in this way, also hearing from you about what your concerns are and also sharing with you information that we may have in a way that we will continue to work together.</p>



<p>This is also a chance for me to reiterate the position of the United States as it relates to Ukraine.&nbsp; As I have said earlier today to our allies around the world, the United States take seriously the importance of the integrity and the territorial integrity of Ukraine and your sovereignty.&nbsp; And the United States stands with Ukraine in this regard.</p>



<p>If Russia further invades your country, as I mentioned earlier today, we will impose swift and severe economic sanctions.&nbsp; We have been clear about that.&nbsp; We are also clear that we would prefer that this would be resolved in a diplomatic way, and we have remained open to a diplomatic path to resolution.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, if Russia takes aggressive action against Ukraine, we are prepared to implement and to do that work in a unified way with our allies around the world.</p>



<p>Any threats to your country, we take seriously, and we have rallied our Allies and our partners to speak with one voice.&nbsp; And those voices have been reflected throughout the course of these last couple of days and before.&nbsp; So I look forward to our conversation.&nbsp; And thank you.<br><br>PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY:&nbsp; (As interpreted.)&nbsp; Thank you very much, Madam Vice President.&nbsp; And thank you for this meeting.&nbsp; This is our first meeting, and I&#8217;m very grateful to you and to our team for having this opportunity to talk to you about the situation which is happening around our borders; about the risks and how to resolve this matter and, I do agree with you, in a peaceful and diplomatic manner, as we have been doing all eight years in a row.</p>



<p>We do clearly understand what is going on.&nbsp; This is our land, and the only thing we want is to have peace, bring the peace back to our country.</p>



<p>And in this case, we are very grateful to the United States, to you personally, to our strategic partners, and President Biden.&nbsp; We have had many meetings with the congressmen and Senate members.&nbsp; And we are grateful for the bipartisan support of the United States.</p>



<p>Today, we do need specific steps, specific support.&nbsp; We are getting support from you in supporting our defense capacity, our army.&nbsp; This is something we are prepared to discuss and continue this dialogue because this is something that we are very interested in.</p>



<p>When I say “we,” I mean not only Ukraine, because our strong army is protecting Europe and we all want to be one unified body, one world which looks into the peaceful future.</p>



<p>As regards to the sanction policy, we are grateful to you for your understanding that sanctions may bring about peaceful resolution of this matter.&nbsp; And I would like to share with you that what &#8212; how we see this, what we think the needs are, and what we think can work.</p>



<p>In any case, we believe in our own strengths and force, the support of our partners, our army.&nbsp; And thank you very much again for this meeting.</p>



<p>VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:&nbsp; Thank you.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Hotel Bayerischer Hof<br>Munich, Germany</em></p>



<p>11:45 A.M. CEST</p>



<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Good morning.&nbsp; Good morning.&nbsp; Thank you, Ambassador Ischinger.&nbsp; And to all of the very extraordinary leaders who are here today, I thank you for the kind introduction and your years of dedicated leadership.&nbsp; And thank you also to Chancellor Scholz for your kind words.<br><br>So, it is an honor to join all of these distinguished leaders from around the world this morning.</p>



<p>I am certain we all recognize this year’s gathering is unlike those of the recent past.&nbsp; Not since the end of the Cold War has this forum convened under such dire circumstances.<br><br>Today, as we are all well aware, the foundation of European security is under direct threat in Ukraine.&nbsp;<br><br>Let us remember: From the wreckage of two world wars, a consensus emerged in Europe and the United States.&nbsp; A consensus in favor of order, not chaos; security, not conflict.<br><br>So by forging relationships and bonds, forging organizations and institutions, laws and treaties, we, together, established a set of rules, norms that have governed ever since.<br><br>And Europe has enjoyed unprecedented peace, security, and prosperity through a commitment to a set of defining principles.&nbsp; The United States is equally committed to these principles: that people have a right to choose their own form of government; that nations have a right to choose their own alliances; that there are inalienable rights which governments must protect; that the rule of law should be cherished; that sovereignty and territorial integrity of all states must be respected; and that national borders should not be changed by force.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>We are here in Munich, together, to reaffirm our commitment to these principles.&nbsp; These principles have brought us peace and security.&nbsp; The backbone of this, of course, is NATO &#8212; the greatest military alliance the world has ever seen.<br><br>As a defensive alliance, we have deterred acts of aggression against NATO territory for the past 75 years.&nbsp; And today, let me be clear: America’s commitment to Article 5 is ironclad.&nbsp; This commitment is sacrosanct to me, to President Biden, and to our entire nation.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>In fact, I am joined here in Munich by a bipartisan delegation from the United States Senate and the United States House of Representatives.&nbsp; They are Democrats and Republicans.&nbsp; They have a wide range of political views.&nbsp; But they stand together in recognition of the value and the importance of our NATO Alliance.<br><br>Now, even in the most difficult times for our transatlantic community and even when our system has been tried and tested, we, the United States and Europe, have come together and demonstrated our strength and our unity, just as we do today &#8212; as we stand in this decisive moment, with all eyes on Ukraine.<br><br>As we have said all along, there is a playbook of Russian aggression.&nbsp; And this playbook is too familiar to us all.</p>



<p>Russia will plead ignorance and innocence, it will create false pretext for invasion, and it will amass troops and firepower in plain sight.<br><br>We now receive reports of what appears to be provocations.&nbsp; And we see Russia spreading disinformation, lies, and propaganda.<br><br>Nonetheless, in a deliberate and coordinated effort, we, together, are: one, exposing the truth and, two, speaking with a unified voice.<br><br>As President Joe Biden has made clear: The United States, our NATO Allies, and our partners have been and remain open to serious diplomacy.&nbsp; We have put concrete proposals on the table.&nbsp; We have encouraged and engaged Russia through NATO, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the United Nations, and bilateral dialogues.&nbsp; We have engaged in good faith.</p>



<p>Russia continues to claim it is ready for talks while, at the same time, it narrows the avenues for diplomacy.&nbsp; Their actions simply do not match their words.<br><br>And let me be clear.&nbsp; I can say with absolute certainty: If Russia further invades Ukraine, the United States, together with our Allies and partners, will impose significant and unprecedented economic costs.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>We have worked intensively with many of you in this room to ensure we are prepared to move forward with consequences.<br><br>We have prepared, together, economic measures that will be swift, severe, and united.&nbsp; We will impose far-reaching financial sanctions and export controls.&nbsp; We will target Russia’s financial institutions and key industries.&nbsp; And we will target those who are complicit and those who aid and abet this unprovoked invasion.<br><br>Make no mistake: The imposition of these sweeping and coordinated measures will inflict great damage on those who must be held accountable.&nbsp; And we will not stop with economic measures.&nbsp; We will further reinforce our NATO Allies on the eastern flank.<br><br>In fact, together we have already taken steps to strengthen our deterrence and collective defense.&nbsp; We have deployed an additional 6,000 American service members to Romania, Poland, and Germany.&nbsp; We have put another 8,500 service members in the United States on a heightened sense of readiness.<br><br>As President Biden has said, our forces will not be deployed to fight inside Ukraine, but they will defend every inch of NATO territory.<br><br>Since Russia launched its proxy war against Ukraine nearly eight years ago, the people of Ukraine have suffered immensely: nearly 14,000 people killed, more than a million displaced, and nearly 3 million in need of aid.<br><br>The United States has provided significant support to Ukraine: security assistance, humanitarian assistance, and economic assistance.&nbsp; And we will continue to support the people of Ukraine.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br>I believe it is important for us &#8212; all of us &#8212; as leaders to never forget the cost of this type of aggression on human lives and livelihoods.<br><br>So, the United States, our Allies, and our partners, together, we have achieved remarkable unity.&nbsp; It is evident in our shared acknowledgment of the threats, our united response, and our determination to uphold international rules and norms.<br><br>In the face of Russian aggression, I have been reassured and heartened by the widespread agreement across the transatlantic community that these rules and norms will be defended.<br><br>And we should not lose sight of how rare it is in history to have a prolonged period of relative peace and stability.&nbsp; So, let the past few months be a reminder to us all: Defending the rules and norms, upholding our principles &#8212; this is the vital work of each generation.<br><br>In recent years, some have questioned whether the West is up to the task.&nbsp; Some have wondered whether this system can endure.&nbsp; Some have even done so on this very stage.<br><br>Indeed, the theme of this conference two years ago questioned the staying power of the West; whether or not the transatlantic community was losing its cohesion, its influence, its appeal.<br><br>So I will answer the skeptics and those seeking to test us: Today, the United States, our Allies, and our partners are closer together.&nbsp; Today, we are clear in our purpose.&nbsp; And today, we are even more confident in our vision.<br><br>Our strength must not be underestimated, because, after all, it lies in our unity.&nbsp; And as we have always shown, it takes a lot more strength to build something up than it takes to tear something down.<br><br>Thank you all.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>AMBASSADOR ISCHINGER:&nbsp; Madam Vice President, thank you so much for this great speech, which I think will be commented about and read about quite a bit in coming hours and days and weeks.</p>



<p>Before we start our conversation, let me repeat what I said before you came into the hall.&nbsp; It was in 2009, President Biden who established &#8212; having just been elected Vice President at that time &#8212; a young tradition, namely that the United States would be represented in Munich by the Vice President.</p>



<p>And he came several times.&nbsp; And I was delighted to see that even the Trump administration followed that example.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re now so happy to have you to continue this tradition.&nbsp; And I would be delighted if you can convey to the President that even if he is now no longer the Vice President, he has always a standing invitation here.&nbsp; (Laughter.)<br><br>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Yes, Ambassador, I will.&nbsp; And I will tell you, it is the President&#8217;s enthusiasm about the importance of this conference that led to my enthusiasm to be with you this afternoon.&nbsp; So thank you very much.<br><br>AMBASSADOR ISCHINGER:&nbsp; Now, on a slightly more serious note: A year ago, when the President appeared on our screen &#8212; actually, in this room &#8212; I was standing right here in this room when he appeared on screen and he said, and I quote, “America is back.&nbsp; The transatlantic alliance is back.”</p>



<p>Now, that was a message that was extremely well received here, even if we &#8212; not all of us knew that we would be threatened in the way that we feel threatened right now, as you just explained.</p>



<p>But as we look forward, there are lots of people here in Germany, in Europe, who asking themselves, “Okay, America is back.&nbsp; That&#8217;s great.&nbsp; But is it for good?&nbsp; Is this for good?”&nbsp; Many in Europe are fearful of a time where maybe some kind of a second Trump could be looming in the future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So here&#8217;s my question: What can or should we Europeans do to keep the United States engaged in Europe long term, not just today as we sit here, and even beyond the current administration?<br><br>I think that is such an important question, because we have learned over these last weeks and months that without the United States considering herself a European power, we&#8217;re actually quite powerless.<br><br>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; I think the evidence of the point that I will make is present in this room.&nbsp; You will see there is probably one of the largest delegations from the United States Congress present today &#8212; Republicans and Democrats who, as I said earlier, you know, often don&#8217;t agree on much, but agree on this.</p>



<p>I would &#8212; I think that the heart of your question really does demand the importance of &#8212; of the perseverance and enduring nature of institutions and alliances.&nbsp; And I would say that, on that point, we are strong.</p>



<p>There is an unwavering commitment to NATO and to the Alliance, as evidenced, again, by the conversations and the unity that has resulted over the last several months where nations have come together, where the United States, we would like to believe, has been among leaders in playing a leadership role to bring together the Allies around common principles and norms, doing it in a way that has been, at its essence, about the value and the strength of diplomacy, which is about direct engagement.</p>



<p>We have counted &#8212; and the Secretary of State is here, Tony Blinken.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve counted an excess of at least 200 conversations just in the last couple of months, be it between the President and others, the Secretary of State, myself, and so on.</p>



<p>So I would say to you that the relationship is strong and that the importance of the relationship is something that we take very seriously, which is why in this historic moment, in this defining moment, potentially, the strength of the institution and the Alliance reveals itself, even if there&#8217;s been a question about that before.<br><br>AMBASSADOR ISCHINGER:  Thank you so much. <br><br>Now, another key team &#8212; key theme of our special edition with President Biden a year ago was this question, and I&#8217;d be interested in your response today.  The question was: Can democracies prove that they can still deliver better solutions to the world&#8217;s major challenges than autocracies?<br></p>



<p>There are skeptics who would probably not have a hard time finding evidence to the contrary over the past period.  What do we need, what do democracies need in order to do better and to convince our people &#8212; peoples that we can do it?<br><br>THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Ambassador, I think this is one of the most challenging issues of our time, which is the relative strength &#8212; the question about the relative strength, efficiency, and effectiveness of democracies versus autocracies.<br><br>I&#8217;m going to always bet on democracies.  I think all of us here share that in common.  And it is a reflection of, again, the principles that we have that include the importance of being a government that reflects the needs and desires of the people through a process that has integrity, that rejects corruption, and embraces the concepts of equality and freedom.<br><br>When we look at the challenge that we face now, in the United States &#8212; and you&#8217;re right, President Joe Biden talks a lot about this &#8212; and we take pride in the fact that the strength of a democra- &#8212; democracy, one measure of that strength will be: Does it deliver on the needs of the people?<br><br>So, for example, in the United States &#8212; again, with thanks and with great attribution to the congressional delegates that are here &#8212; we passed a Bipartisan Infrastructure Law that was one of the first in generations that will deliver on the needs of the people. <br><br>So, I would say that the strength of democracies and the way that democracies will prevail, one &#8212; one measure of that will be: Does it actually deliver for the people? <br><br>But that being said, there is a duality that is always present, I believe, which is that democracy is both &#8212; it both has the characters of &#8212; characteristics of strength and fragility, meaning that it is incumbent on each of us to understand the strength of democracy to deliver for the people, but also the fragility of democracies, which is that if we are not vigilant, if we don&#8217;t fight for the principles, then they can fade. <br><br>And so, that, again, brings us to the reason that we are here today: to continuously reaffirm and rededicate ourselves as a community to the strength of democracies and the need for us to not only individually but collectively uphold its principles, its values, and its purpose.<br><br>AMBASSADOR ISCHINGER:  Thank you very much.  Now, I think I have no choice but to return to our overriding theme this weekend, which has been when Secretary Stoltenberg spoke earlier and Chancellor Scholz spoke just before you.  Of course, the central theme was &#8212; and you talked about it just a few minutes ago &#8212; was Ukraine. <br><br>So, the Biden administration, the President himself, you &#8212; you&#8217;ve all stated that you expect that there will be some kind of military action by Russia going forward.  Now, I &#8212; personally, I&#8217;ve no question about your determination to do what you announced to do. <br></p>



<p>But I think this audience would be interested in how you and the Biden administration judges our readiness.  Do you think we, Europeans, are sufficiently prepared for such a kind of worst-case scenario, which would &#8212; in my view at least, which would tend to sort of, you know, terminate the search for a durable and peaceful European security architecture?  And we&#8217;ve been working on that for more than a generation &#8212; for two generations.<br><br>So, the question is: If you could reflect a bit about how you think about this and what, conceivably, Americans and Europeans &#8212; working together &#8212; what we could do in the future even better in terms of speaking with Russia, not only about Russia. <br><br>You know, one of the things I really regret is that the Russian government decided not to come here.  I would have appreciated an opportunity to challenge them on this stage, as has been the case for many years here Munich. <br><br>So &#8212; but I think you understand my question.<br><br>THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, as I said in my speech, I am reassured and heartened by the work that we have collectively done over the last several months.  And it is work.  Not everyone started out in the same place in terms of a variety of issues that are on the table.  How do we define &#8220;aggression&#8221;?  What should be the consequences?  Which consequences are appropriate?  Which are we willing to pursue?  Which aren&#8217;t we willing to pursue?  So we didn&#8217;t all start out in the same place. <br><br>But through diplomacy &#8212; and again, this speaks to the strength of diplomacy &#8212; we came together and are now speaking with a unified voice.  And that voice was a function of not only dialogue, but debate, some concessions, but also a practical realization of the moment that we&#8217;re in, which is that we are looking at a sovereign nation that may very well be on the verge of being invaded yet again.<br><br>And perhaps this is a moment, as life does present us with those moments, that challenge us to ask what is our reason for being.  And I think we all know the history of NATO and its reason for being.  The spirit behind this term we use, &#8220;the transatlantic community.&#8221;  The word &#8220;community,&#8221; meaning a collection, not &#8212; a collection of individuals who see themselves as a collection than as one.  And that’s where we are now.<br><br>I don’t disagree with you that it would be nice if we were presented with other circumstances, be it at this conference or in the world, but that’s not where we are.<br><br>We remain open to diplomacy.  We have said it continuously, and our deeds, our words, and our actions have reflected that priority.</p>



<p>We believe that when you define the strength of any nation &#8212; certainly I&#8217;ll speak for the United States &#8212; we believe it is an expression of our strength to seek, as a first priority, a diplomatic resolution to any conflict.&nbsp; And I believe we&#8217;ve been clear about that.&nbsp; But yet, we are presented with this moment today.</p>



<p>And so the question is: If that diplomacy leads to a dead end &#8212; we hope it does not; I said that again in my speech today, the President said it last night &#8212; we are still open to a diplomatic resolution.&nbsp; But if it does not, we are also clear-eyed that there must be consequences.&nbsp;<br><br>And so we have clearly articulated the consequences we have in store, and they will be severe and swift.&nbsp; And they were derived through a process, again, of diplomatic discussions and engagement wherein there has been some consensus around what would be appropriate, given perhaps some predictable scenarios.</p>



<p>I think this moment speaks to, yes, a moment we would like to avoid, if it was avoidable, but it also speaks to our resolve to speak with one voice and a unified voice.</p>



<p>History has challenged us over the years in that regard.&nbsp; But I think history will show that, at this moment, we are standing strong.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>AMBASSADOR ISCHINGER:&nbsp; Madam Vice President, I can only thank you on behalf of our participants of this audience and of those who are listening from the outside for traveling over &#8212; for coming over here in these difficult circumstances with pandemic conditions.&nbsp; You know, under more normal circumstances, there would be like 600 people in this hall.&nbsp; It would be totally overcrowded.&nbsp; So thank you for doing this.&nbsp;<br>Thank you for doing this for us.&nbsp; For us here in Europe, it’s &#8212; it’s an enormously reassuring message.&nbsp;<br><br>And I want to invite all of you to offer to the Vice President of the United States a warm round of applause, if you could, please.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>END&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 12:14 P.M. CEST</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Munich, Germany </em></p>



<p>AIDE:&nbsp; (Inaudible) on background with a senior administration official, and embargoed until the end of the conversation.&nbsp; And it’s just going to be [senior administration official].<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This conversation.<br><br>AIDE:&nbsp; Embargoed until the end of this conversation, on background with a senior administration official.<br><br>So, [senior administration official] will give some opening thoughts and then happy to take questions.<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; So, let me just sort of do a brief overview and walk you a little bit through the events of today and the plans for tomorrow.<br><br>But in the context of this overall trip &#8212; in the context of the overall trip, I think we already talked about a little bit, is that the context of this administration&#8217;s approach to this crisis and approach to our alliances and partnerships in general, which we stress was key to this administration&#8217;s foreign policy from the start.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s moments like these that they become particularly important.&nbsp;<br><br>And you&#8217;ve seen, I think in the recent weeks and days, a very deliberate, intentional, coordinated, and clear rollout on how we&#8217;re approaching this crisis.&nbsp; You&#8217;ve heard it multiple times from the President, from the Secretary of State, from the Secretary of Defense, and the Vice President.&nbsp;<br><br>And she came here as part of that overall approach to this crisis to do a number of things: to continue the process of consulting as we continue to flesh out our response to Russia&#8217;s aggression and threats of aggression; coordinating that with our close partners in Europe who are involved in this; and delivering the message that we&#8217;ve been delivering all along to them &#8212; one of support and solidarity and commitment to some core principles, and to the Russians that we are and continue to be ready for diplomacy &#8212; and we put a lot of ideas on the table &#8212; but we&#8217;re also determined to respond as we need to respond and impose costs if they go ahead and continue with the further invasion of Ukraine.&nbsp;<br><br>So this is part of a real administration-wide process of consultation with our close allies.&nbsp;<br><br>So it was, in that context, fitting that her first meeting of the day was with NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg.&nbsp; There are a lot of elements to our response, and they&#8217;re not only military and defensive and deterrence, but they include that.&nbsp; And NATO has been a big part of the response to Russia&#8217;s activities.&nbsp;<br><br>And she used this opportunity with the Secretary General to further coordinate how we as an Alliance of 30 countries are responding.&nbsp; And so they talked about some of what we&#8217;ve already done and some of what we might need to do in the future.&nbsp; And you know &#8212; we&#8217;ve already talked about some of the force posture adjustments we&#8217;ve made to reinforce our Allies to which we have Article 5 commitments in NATO.&nbsp; So we&#8217;ve done a lot of that, including sending troops from the United States &#8212; further troops from the United States to Europe, and also what we&#8217;ve done for Ukraine, including the $650 million of defense assistance.&nbsp;<br><br>And she thanked the Secretary General for his leadership over the past eight years.&nbsp; He&#8217;s been a stalwart friend of the United States and a great leader of this Alliance and is called upon to lead at a really difficult time.&nbsp;<br><br>So they talked about Alliance unity, the way forward.&nbsp; I mentioned force posture adjustments and also the diplomacy.&nbsp; You saw that we, as recently as Secretary Blinken&#8217;s speech &#8212; either yesterday or the day before; it&#8217;s hard to even keep track &#8212; at the U.N. said that we&#8217;re still ready to meet and proposed a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov.&nbsp; NATO has done the same &#8212; the Secretary for NATO-Russia Council.&nbsp;<br><br>So this was a real opportunity to coordinate on all those fronts, diplomatic and military.&nbsp;<br><br>Following a meeting with Secretary General Stoltenberg, she met with the three leaders of the Baltic states &#8212; Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia.&nbsp; It was really important for her in that meeting &#8212; for the Vice President &#8212; to underscore our enduring and unshakable commitment to NATO’s Article 5.&nbsp; These are among the Allies who are most concerned about that because they feel the threat themselves directly, and not least from the massive Russian military presence in Belarus.&nbsp; And so she reassured them that the United States means what it says when it says it&#8217;s committed to Article 5.<br><br>And they, together, discussed some of the same themes from the meeting with the NATO Secretary General &#8212; the force posture adjustments that we made, the further troops and equipment that we&#8217;ve sent to Europe to, as we&#8217;ve said many times, be ready for any contingency.<br><br>The Vice President also discussed with them the issue of costs, which we all in this Alliance agree on it, if Russia goes in further.&nbsp; And that requires coordination of economic sanctions, which has been a priority for us as well.&nbsp; These are members of the European Union, and their role in that will be important.&nbsp;<br><br>And then, finally, she had a meeting with a bipartisan delegation from Congress &#8212; I think we&#8217;ve put out some information about that already &#8212; but delegations led by Speaker Pelosi and Senators Graham and Whitehouse &#8212; bipartisan, bicameral.<br><br>The Vice President, as a sort of a tradition at the Munich Security Conference, took the opportunity to meet with them.&nbsp;&nbsp;And that was not only useful to see them and discuss some of the issues, but to demonstrate that our approach to this crisis is really a bipartisan one.&nbsp; There are plenty of divisions in Washington on plenty of issues.&nbsp; But I think it&#8217;s fair to say when it comes to standing up to Russia and its aggression, we&#8217;re quite unified.&nbsp; And that was a really important message and is an important message that the Vice President here is here leading our delegation.&nbsp; And there are important members of both houses of Congress here as well.&nbsp;<br><br>Sorry to go on for so long, but maybe a couple of things about tomorrow, and then after we&#8217;ll take a few questions.&nbsp;<br><br>So, the main element of tomorrow&#8217;s program is her speech to the Munich Security Conference.&nbsp; I think, as I mentioned before, you know, you&#8217;ve heard from other senior people in this administration, starting with the President &#8212; and you&#8217;ll see, I think, her speech fit into the message that we&#8217;ve been sending from the start of this crisis: that we are preparing for either contingency, diplomacy or a response &#8212; a tough response, as necessary.&nbsp;<br><br>We have been putting the world on notice of what we&#8217;re afraid of and seeing from the Russians &#8212; these provocations that we fear that they could use as a pretext for invading Ukraine.&nbsp; And in the past hours and days, unfortunately, we have seen some of those.<br><br>The Vice President &#8212; I think you can expect her to articulate some core themes.&nbsp; And I (inaudible) get into too much detail about the speech, but she will no doubt articulate some important themes, including “strength through unity.”&nbsp; The whole point of meeting with these close Allies is that we&#8217;re stronger when we&#8217;re acting together.&nbsp;<br><br>I think she&#8217;ll underscore some of the core principles that are at stake here &#8212; you know, not least that: One country simply can&#8217;t decide it&#8217;s just going to invade another country and violate the sovereignty and territorial integrity.&nbsp; It’s a core principle of NATO and many other organizations in which we’re a part, and certainly one that we believe in and the Vice President strongly believes in.<br><br>She will make clear, as we have been making clear for days and weeks and months, that we remain, even at this late hour, open to diplomacy.&nbsp; But if the Russians reject that diplomacy that we have offered, that will be a sign that they weren&#8217;t really serious about it.<br><br>I think you can expect the Vice President to be clear about the costs that would be imposed on Russia if it further invades Ukraine.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve been pretty clear that those (inaudible) will include significant, severe, and swift financial sanctions and export controls that will be very costly to Russia and weaken Russia.&nbsp;&nbsp; And that&#8217;s, in fact, one of the core points that, regardless of what happens, we, in this Alliance, believe we will emerge stronger and Russia will emerge weaker.&nbsp;<br><br>Then, the rest of the schedule I think we discussed on the call the other day: a bilateral meeting with President Zelenskyy of Ukraine, a bilateral meeting with Chancellor Scholz of Germany.&nbsp; And then a number of other, you know, what we call “pull-asides” with a number of other leaders &#8212; world leaders in town that she will be meeting with.<br><br>I don&#8217;t have a list for you, frankly, simply because the schedule, like the world is, is in flux.&nbsp; And we haven&#8217;t set a final schedule, but you can be sure there&#8217;ll be a number of other world leaders that she’ll spend some time with &#8212; once again, because &#8212; going back to the core point that we&#8217;re stronger when we&#8217;re together, this whole trip is about coordinating with key partners.<br><br>AIDE:&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; Let’s open it up to questions.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can we &#8212; you mentioned the conversations today with the Baltic leaders and commitment to Article 5.&nbsp; They also were asked for a greater U.S. presence.&nbsp; (Inaudible) pretty blunt, and I thought that the wording was strong about “we&#8217;ve lost our freedom to Russia once; we don&#8217;t want to do it again” &#8212; is what Estonia&#8217;s Prime Minister said.&nbsp;<br><br>What commitments are you guys ready to make to them? &nbsp;And in the case of Lithuania, they formally asked to go from the rotational presence to something more permanent.&nbsp; Is this just necessary at this point in the world we live in for there to be a bigger and more permanent presence on the eastern flank?<br><br>And then, secondly, on Zelenskyy, is there any concern tomorrow about him coming, even if it&#8217;s just for several hours, to be seen outside of Ukraine at such a fluid and difficult time?<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; So, on the first, I don’t have any new announcements on force posture in Europe beyond those that, you know, our administration has already announced.&nbsp; Because I did say that we have adjusted force posture.&nbsp; And we do that to be ready for any contingency, and that&#8217;s &#8212; that&#8217;s what we remain determined to do.&nbsp;<br><br>As you know, there is already NATO force posture presence in the Baltic states: battalions announced &#8212; rotational battalions after 2014, and also Baltic Air Policing, where NATO countries help them patrol the airspace.&nbsp;<br><br>But I think you will find that our force posture &#8212; we have said: If Russia further invades Ukraine, then we will continue to look at the force posture that is necessary to make sure Article 5 is preserved, protected, and all of our countries can be defended.&nbsp;<br><br>On Zelenskyy, I don&#8217;t have anything to announce that we announced the other day.&nbsp; I think you probably saw that his spokesman put out a statement that they were considering their trip, so I can only refer you to the Ukrainians as to President Zelenskyy’s plans about being in Munich.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there any concern about him coming?<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; No.&nbsp; What is important is that we continue our dialogue with the Ukrainians and continue to demonstrate support for the Ukrainians.<br><br>President Biden has spoken a number of times with President Zelenskyy.&nbsp; Secretary Blinken has been in Kyiv.&nbsp; We have, as a government, engaged very closely to demonstrate our support for Ukraine in this situation.&nbsp;<br><br>And when President Zelenskyy said he was going to be in Munich, this was another opportunity to continue that dialogue.&nbsp;&nbsp;And if he&#8217;s here, the Vice President will be &#8212; it will be an important opportunity for her to engage with him.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, there is no effort to ask or encourage Zelenskyy not to leave Ukraine?<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; That&#8217;s really his call.&nbsp; It&#8217;s really up to him where he feels he needs to be.&nbsp; If he&#8217;s in Munich, the Vice President will look forward to meeting with him.&nbsp; If he decides he needs to be in Ukraine, we&#8217;ll find other ways of engaging with him to keep on the dialogue that we&#8217;ve had from the start.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Following up also on the Lithuanian &#8212;&nbsp;I mean, that was a very public request.&nbsp; It was made very directly to Vice President Harris about the permanent troops.&nbsp; I mean, what do you &#8212; what do you make of just the fact that it&#8217;s such a public request?&nbsp; I mean, is it &#8212; is that &#8212; you mentioned things will change if there&#8217;s invasion.&nbsp; Does that mean permanent rotation is under consideration?<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; What it means is that we have had and continue to have a very fruitful and, I think, satisfactory dialogue with all of our NATO partners, including &#8212; or, you might even say, especially &#8212; the Baltic states in recent weeks and months about force posture, and we’ll continue to do so.<br><br>Secretary Austin was just at the NATO defense ministerial in Brussels.&nbsp; He then went on to Poland and is going to Lithuania to continue this discussion of what is the best and right force posture for the United States and NATO in Europe.&nbsp;<br><br>So, I don&#8217;t have anything beyond that to say except that, obviously, we&#8217;re constantly looking at what we need to do to defend all of our NATO Allies.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you know, has President Putin &#8212; has President Putin made up his mind on whether to attack or not?&nbsp; Does the U.S. believe he knows now what he&#8217;s going to do?<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; So, I think you&#8217;ve heard us be pretty clear that we don&#8217;t try to figure out what&#8217;s in his mind.&nbsp; All we can do is watch what we’re watching.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, no determination has been made yet on whether he plans to attack or not, at this point?<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; We can&#8217;t know what&#8217;s in his head.&nbsp; We can’t know what’s in his head.&nbsp; We just have to prepare for what &#8212; you know, we have noted what we feared could precede an invasion as being alleged provocations and what could be a pretext.&nbsp; We&#8217;re seeing some of those things which are a great cause for concern.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s why our diplomacy that the Vice President is leading here in Munich has been intensified.&nbsp; But we&#8217;re not going to guess what&#8217;s in President Putin’s mind.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A couple of quick questions.&nbsp; President Putin obviously did a news conference earlier today in which he sort of brushed off, you know, the threat of &#8212;<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: &nbsp;I’m sorry, what news conference?<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; President Putin did a news conference earlier today, which you’re obviously aware of, but there he spoke about sort of how the West always finds a pretext to impose sanctions on Moscow.&nbsp; So, essentially, kind of brushing off the threat that has been sort of the cornerstone of the, you know, the U.S. strategy.&nbsp;<br><br>How concerned are you that, you know, this has kind of failed to really deter him in the past?&nbsp; Do you &#8212; do you really think that that&#8217;s going to happen this time?<br><br>And also, separately, the Russian Defense Ministry said that he&#8217;s going to oversee nuclear drills in Russia on Saturday.&nbsp; Do you consider that to be a concerning sign &#8212; a sign of escalation?&nbsp; How &#8212; you know, how are you thinking about, sort of, Putin looking at nuclear drills in Russia in this situation?<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; So, on the first, you know, look, obviously there are no guarantees.&nbsp; All we can do is make clear that there will be severe costs if Russia decides to further invade Ukraine.&nbsp;<br><br>We&#8217;ve also made clear, because you alluded to him saying that &#8220;they&#8217;ve put sanctions on us before&#8221;&nbsp;&#8212; which is true; we have done for other violations &#8212; we&#8217;ve made clear that these sanctions would go well beyond anything we&#8217;ve done in the past.&nbsp; And we&#8217;ve put on some significant sanctions not just in 2014 after the invasion of Ukraine and annexation of parts of southeastern Ukraine and the annexation of Crimea, but well beyond anything we&#8217;ve done since then.&nbsp;<br><br>And I mention that that will include very severe financial sanctions, coordinated with our European allies, and export controls to weaken Russia&#8217;s industrial base, defense industrial base.&nbsp;<br><br>So, we hope President Putin really takes that to heart and gets that message, because if he thinks somehow invading or occupying Ukraine will strengthen Russia, we believe we&#8217;re going to demonstrate through these actions the opposite is the case.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So you&#8217;re confident that this is going to act as a deterrent?&nbsp;<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; I&#8217;m sorry?<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So you&#8217;re confident that this is going to act as a deterrent?&nbsp; Everything you have planned, in terms of export controls and sanctions, that is going to deter him this time around?<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; I&#8217;m not making any predictions about it.&nbsp; I’m just describing what the thinking behind what we&#8217;re doing is.&nbsp; We&#8217;re bolstering Ukraine.&nbsp; We&#8217;re reinforcing our NATO Allies in Europe to make sure they&#8217;re safe.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re going to hit Russia with very severe economic costs if it goes in, while also saying, to this day: We are ready for and prefer a different path, which is diplomacy.&nbsp;<br><br>So I&#8217;m not making any predictions.&nbsp; I&#8217;m just describing what we&#8217;re conveying with the hope that it will lead the Russians to see that they are better off and we are all better off if they choose the course of diplomacy.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And could you please answer my question on the nuclear drills?&nbsp; The &#8212; you know, that the Defense Ministry said is going to happen tomorrow and Putin is going to actually be overseeing them.&nbsp; Do you think that is &#8212; would you classify that as escalation?<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; I think &#8212; obviously, in the context like this with so many military forces deployed and lots of tensions in the region, I think it&#8217;s fair to say that adding on top of that with nuclear and other strategic exercises is escalatory and unfortunate.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey, can you talk about the coordination or whatever between the Vice President and the Secretary of State?&nbsp; Are they talking?&nbsp; Are they meeting regularly?&nbsp; Are they kind of staying in their own lane and all of that stuff?<br><br>And a second question: I wonder &#8212; one of the things that President Biden did was sort of speak directly to the Russian people, you know, in some of his speeches over the last week.&nbsp; I wonder if the Vice President plans to do something similar to issue a message or (inaudible) directly to the Russian people, directly to Putin in her speech, or whenever.<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; So, on the latter, I&#8217;ll leave that to the speech.&nbsp; I described some of the key themes I thought &#8212; I think you can expect her to address.&nbsp; But I won&#8217;t preempt the speech further on that particular point.&nbsp;<br><br>Although, you know, we do think it&#8217;s important &#8212; and that&#8217;s why the President embraced it &#8212; and that&#8217;s, you know, linked to this issue of costs as well, because we want the Russian people to know this is not against the Russian people.&nbsp; We&#8217;re trying to defend Ukraine against an invasion, and have no ill will towards the Russian people.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why we prefer diplomacy.&nbsp;<br><br>As for the Vice President and Secretary Blinken: Yes, they are in extraordinarily close contact.&nbsp; They&#8217;ve met several times today, in fact &#8212; or at least a couple of times &#8212; including a private meeting this morning to coordinate and work together on how we&#8217;re going to advance our &#8212;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Inaudible.)<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Blinken.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And?<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The VP.<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; The Vice President and Secretary Blinken (inaudible).<br><br>And so, you know, I actually began by talking about how, we as an administration, have been rolling out a deliberate, intentional, coordinated strategy with multiple actors doing multiple things as part of the same team, and that&#8217;s what this deployment to Munich is.<br><br>I mentioned the Vice President has had and will continue to have a number of bilateral meetings with her counterparts &#8212; as mentioned, the two presidents and prime minister of the Baltic states, Chancellor Scholz, Secretary General of NATO, and President Zelenskyy.&nbsp;<br><br>And Secretary Blinken has had and will continue to have numerous contacts with his foreign minister counterparts, both bilaterally and multilaterally.&nbsp;<br><br>So, we are &#8212; you know, in the context of what I mentioned about being here and coordinating, and, you know, this is all about strength, unity, dialogue, and coordination.&nbsp; That &#8212; you know, their activities here are a core part of that approach.<br><br>But, absolutely intimately in contact with each other, including, as I mentioned, discussions throughout the day.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you share &#8212; can you share anything of what they&#8217;ve talked about or specifics, like how, specifically, does he guide her &#8212; whether it&#8217;s in a specific meeting or a specific question, or is it more as a sounding board?&nbsp; I just want to understand it better.<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; No, they&#8217;re implementing the same strategy.&nbsp; And I&#8217;ve described &#8212; we&#8217;ve all described what we&#8217;re doing here: coordinating a joint approach with Europeans on sanctions, if it comes to that; looking together with our NATO partners on force posture adjustments; and discussing our support for Ukraine, which is not just military, but the sovereign loan guarantee.&nbsp; And so, they are implementing the exact same policy set by the President, and they&#8217;re doing it together.&nbsp;<br><br>AIDE:&nbsp; We have time, folks, for two more questions.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the SWIFT &#8212;<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Let’s go to Molly.&nbsp; She hasn’t had a chance.&nbsp; And then come back to Jennifer.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, go ahead.&nbsp; Yeah.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; I wanted to ask about the (inaudible) reports of the Russian separatists reporting mass evacuations and signaling that there&#8217;s a possible explosion that &#8212; a lot of reports coming out of that region.&nbsp;<br><br>You talked about the Vice President being willing to talk about some of these false-flag efforts in her speech.&nbsp; How specific do you expect her to get?&nbsp; And does the United States believe that these reports of mass evacuations that we&#8217;re seeing are part of a false-flag effort that are starting and could, perhaps, lead to a full-scale invasion by Russia?<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; So, I&#8217;m just not sure I specifically said she would talk about that in her speech.&nbsp; If I did, maybe I misspoke, because what I was suggesting is that that has been the predicate to her speech.&nbsp; Like, she&#8217;s giving a speech at a moment when we&#8217;ve already warned that we&#8217;re going to see a potential pretext for an invasion, and we&#8217;ve already started to do that.&nbsp; So that&#8217;s like where we are at the moment she&#8217;s giving her speech.&nbsp; I think it&#8217;s been important to do that in advance because we&#8217;ve seen it play out.&nbsp;<br><br>So, as for confirming &#8212; I think I mentioned the other day when we talked about this &#8212; you know, this approach of throwing spaghetti at the wall.&nbsp; They&#8217;ve alleged many, many different things, most of which we can&#8217;t confirm.&nbsp; And that is concerning because they are all potentially in that category of things that they&#8217;re going to point to.&nbsp;<br><br>So you mentioned the specific one of evacuations.&nbsp; That&#8217;s troubling, as are the allegations of shelling and missile deployments and many of the other things that they have alleged that we&#8217;re not able to confirm, which makes us worry that this is part of what we were afraid of: that they&#8217;re coming up with some pretext for using force against Ukraine.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there any update on the troop levels?&nbsp; You know, since the 7,000, have there been &#8212; has the administration seen any additional troops come in the last &#8212; I guess, was it &#8212; has it been 24 hours since the 7,000?&nbsp; Or 48 hours?&nbsp; Does &#8212; do the numbers continue to rise?&nbsp; Are there more signs on the border of a potential invasion? &nbsp;<br><br>And also, you mentioned about seriousness of diplomacy.&nbsp; Does the administration now feel or is it increasingly feeling that Russia is not interested in diplomacy?<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; So, on the first, I won&#8217;t go beyond.&nbsp; I think the President, you know, yesterday said something about, you know, upwards of 150,000 troops.&nbsp; We do &#8212; we have been clear that we are not seeing the withdrawals that they are claiming.&nbsp; In fact, the 7,000 you refer to is &#8212; not only did we not see the withdrawals, but we saw an additional 7,000, and we have not seen withdrawals (inaudible).<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But have you seen increases since then?<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; I don’t have any increases to announce here.<br><br>And the second part of your question is on diplomacy?<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About diplomacy.&nbsp; And does the United States &#8212; you know, Harris said it’s up to &#8212; the onus is on Russia to take diplomacy seriously.<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the consideration that &#8212; does the United States now acknowledge or think that Russia is not taking it seriously &#8212; diplomacy?<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; The next few days will tell us a lot.&nbsp; I think you heard Secretary Blinken at the United Nations the other day make that clear that he is ready to meet his counterpart.&nbsp; NATO did the same &#8212; the NATO-Russia Council.<br><br>If Russia invades, notwithstanding our offers to continue to talk following these specific things we put on the table in terms of diplomacy, I think we would be forced by that to conclude that Russia is not ready for diplomacy.&nbsp; That would be the sign.&nbsp; But until that happens, we’re still (inaudible), because that’s a far preferable approach for everybody.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And until that happens, can you not rule out that they are not willing to find some sort of diplomatic &#8212; I mean, it seems like we’ve been in this pattern, the status quo, for a while.&nbsp; The administration is saying that, you know, they’re poised to do something at any time.&nbsp; It’s been a couple weeks.&nbsp; Things haven’t happened.&nbsp; And I guess the question is, sort of &#8212; it seems like by saying you’re not closing the door, that you are leaving some room open for them to still come to the table and do that in a substantive way.<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; We are.&nbsp; The space has gotten narrower and narrower over time, with the troop buildup and the rejection of some of the specific ideas we put on the table.&nbsp; But we are not ruling it out.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And in terms of what Putin said today about being willing to negotiate but needing the West and the U.S. to take seriously all of their demands, obviously the sticking point with NATO on foreclosing Ukraine’s membership in NATO is not somewhere that you’re going to go.&nbsp; Do you think that this can &#8211; that there can be some kind of, you know, point of compromise here?&nbsp; Or are both sides kind of talking past one another?<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; We continue to be ready to test the proposition.&nbsp; When the Russians first put their ideas forward, we said that some of them were non-starters but others provided a basis for discussion, and we proposed those discussions then and we continue to propose them now.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the SWIFT financial system, Daleep Singh at the briefing did say that that probably will not be part of the initial package of sanctions.&nbsp; Can you maybe explain a little bit why?&nbsp; Why wouldn’t the SWIFT &#8212; yanking them from SWIFT be part of the initial part of the sanctions?&nbsp; Is that something the VP is still talking with folks about?&nbsp; Was it because the Allies just were not quite comfortable with it for various reasons, which are understandable?&nbsp; Or can you just explain that a little?<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; I won’t go beyond what Daleep said about SWIFT, but I will say that coordinating specific sanctions with the Europeans remains a core part of our approach and remains part of the diplomacy that the Vice President is doing here in Munich.&nbsp;<br><br>We believe we are already quite united and are determined to be as united as possible.&nbsp; And this is something the Vice President has already brought up and will continue to bring up with our key partners in Europe.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sorry, just had a quick last question on Anne, during the briefing in the White House, where she attributed the cyberattack on Ukraine on Russia.&nbsp; I was just wondering if you can give us any details on how the U.S. plan &#8212; or Allies plan to sort of respond to that.&nbsp; Are you planning to retaliate?&nbsp; I mean, how do you take that from here on?<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; I’ll have to leave that with what Anne had already to say about it, you know, except maybe to say: Obviously, cyber is part of this (inaudible) of things that we’re concerned about.&nbsp; We have heard that and the Vice President has heard it from partners here in Europe.&nbsp; You know that the Baltic states, Estonia in particular, has been the subject of cyberattacks.&nbsp;<br><br>So the only thing I would add is to just underscore that we obviously take that seriously as a part of the things that we’re going to speak about.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it fair to say the speech has been evolving because of all these &#8212; the attacks and everything over the last few days?<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; It’s fair to say that we have taken a consistent approach.&nbsp; Obviously, there’s &#8212; it’s a fluid situation and new developments, and you always take those into account when you’re doing a speech.&nbsp; But I think you’ll find that the speech fits squarely into the consistent approach that this administration has been taking for weeks and months now.&nbsp; And it’s just one more part of this important project.<br><br>END</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Roosevelt Room</p>



<p>4:54 P.M. EST</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Good afternoon.&nbsp; Today, I made two vital calls, as I&#8217;ve been making for some months now &#8212; two vital calls that &#8212; on the situation in Russia and Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The first was to a bipartisan group of members of Congress who are currently representing the United States, along with Vice President Harris at the Munich Security Conference.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The second was the latest in a series of calls over the past many months with the heads of state of our NATO Allies and the European Union to bring them up to date on what the United States thinks is the current state of affairs, and what&#8217;s likely to happen in Ukraine in the coming days, to ensure that we continue to remain in lockstep &#8212; that is the European Union and NATO.</p>



<p>Despite Russia&#8217;s efforts to divide us at home and abroad, I can affirm that has not happened.&nbsp; The overwhelming message of both &#8212; on both calls was one of unity, determination, and resolve.&nbsp; I shared with all of those on the calls what we know about a rapidly escalating crisis in Ukraine.</p>



<p>Over the last few days, we&#8217;ve seen reports of a major uptick in violations of the ceasefire by Russian-backed fighters attempting to provoke Ukraine in the Donbas.&nbsp; For example, a shelling of a Ukrainian kindergarten yesterday, which Russia has falsely asserted was carried out by Ukraine.&nbsp; We also continue to see more and more disinformation being pushed out by &#8212; to the Russian public, including the Russian-backed separatists, claiming that Ukraine is planning to launch a massive offensive attack in the Donbas.</p>



<p>Well, look, there is simply no evidence of these assertions, and it and devies [sic] &#8212; it defies basic logic to believe the Ukrainians would choose this moment, with well over 150,000 troops arrayed on its borders, to escalate a year-long conflict.</p>



<p>Russia state media also continues to make phony allegations of a genocide taking place in the Donbas and push fabricated claims warning about Ukraine’s attack on Russia without any evidence.&nbsp; That&#8217;s just what I&#8217;m sure Ukraine is thinking of doing &#8212; attacking Russia.</p>



<p>All these are consistent with the playbook the Russians have used before: to set up a false justification to act against Ukraine.&nbsp; This is also in line with the pretext scenarios that the United States and our Allies and partners have been warning about for weeks.</p>



<p>Throughout these tense moments, the Ukrainian forces have shown great judgment and, I might add, restraint.&nbsp; They’ve refused to allow the Russians to bait them into war.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the fact remains: Russian troops currently have Ukraine surrounded &#8212; from Belarus, along the Russian border with Ukraine, to the Black Sea in the south &#8212; and all of its border.</p>



<p>You know, look, we have reason to believe the Russian forces are planning to and intend to attack Ukraine in the coming week &#8212; in the coming days.&nbsp; We believe that they will target Ukraine&#8217;s capital, Kyiv, a city of 2.8 million innocent people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We&#8217;re calling out Russia’s plans loudly and repeatedly, not because we want a conflict, but because we&#8217;re doing everything in our power to remove any reason that Russia may give to justify invading Ukraine and prevent them from moving.</p>



<p>Make no mistake: If Russia pursues its plans, it will be responsible for a catastrophic and needless war of choice.&nbsp; The United States and our Allies are prepared to defend every inch of NATO territory from any threat to our collective security as well.</p>



<p>We also will not send troops in to fight in Ukraine, but we will continue to support the Ukrainian people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This past year, the United States provided a record amount of security assistance to Ukraine to bolster its defensive &#8212; $650 million, from Javelin missiles to ammunition.</p>



<p>And we also previously provided $500 million in Ukrai- &#8212; in humanitarian aid and economic support for Ukraine.&nbsp; And earlier this week, we also announced an additional sovereign loan guarantee of up to $1 billion to strengthen Ukraine&#8217;s economic resilience.</p>



<p>But the bottom line is this: The United States and our Allies and partners will support the Ukrainian people.&nbsp; We will hold Russia accountable for its actions.&nbsp; The West is united and resolved.&nbsp; We&#8217;re ready to impose severe sanctions on Russia if it further invades Ukraine.</p>



<p>But I say again: Russia can still choose diplomacy.&nbsp; It is not too late to de-escalate and return to the negotiating table.</p>



<p>Last night, Russia agreed that Secretary of State Blinken and Foreign Minister Lavrov should meet on Feb- &#8212; on February 24th &#8212; February 24th in Europe.</p>



<p>But if Russia takes military action before that date, it will be clear that they have slammed the door shut on diplomacy.&nbsp; They will have &#8212; they will have chosen war, and they will pay a steep price for doing so &#8212; not only from the sanctions that we and our allies will impose on Russia, but the moral outrage that the rest of the world will visit upon them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You know, there are many issues that divide our nation and our world, but standing up to Russian aggression is not one of them.&nbsp; The American people are united.&nbsp; Europe is united.&nbsp; The transatlantic community is united.&nbsp; Our political parties in this country are united.&nbsp; The entire free world is united.</p>



<p>Russia has a choice between war and all the suffering it will bring or diplomacy that will make a future safer for everyone.</p>



<p>Now I&#8217;m happy to take a few questions.&nbsp; Nancy from Bloomberg.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you so much, sir.&nbsp; Do you think that it is wise for President Zelenskyy to leave Ukraine if an invasion is as imminent as the U.S. says it is?</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; That&#8217;s a judgment for him to make and a determination as to whether or not.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve spoken with Zelenskyy a dozen times &#8212; maybe more, I don&#8217;t know.&nbsp; And &#8212; and it&#8217;s &#8212; and in the pursuit of a diplomatic solution, it may not be fal- &#8212; it may be the wise choice.&nbsp; But it&#8217;s his decision.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And do you have any indication about whether President Putin has made a decision on whether to invade?&nbsp; Do you feel confident that he &#8212; that he hasn&#8217;t made that decision already?</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; As of this moment, I&#8217;m convinced he&#8217;s made the decision.&nbsp; We have reason to believe that.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There seems to be a unanimity, a spirit to do &#8212; between the United States and Europe to do some sanctions &#8212; comprehensive sanctions.&nbsp; But are &#8212; is everyone on board with the exact same sanctions that you want to do?</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; There will be some slight differences, but none &#8212; there will be more add-ons than subtractions.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And President Putin is going to oversee some nuclear drills this weekend.&nbsp; How do you see that happening?&nbsp; What&#8217;s your reaction to that, sir?&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Well, I don&#8217;t think he is remotely contemplating nuclear &#8212; using nuclear weapons.&nbsp; But I do think it&#8217;s &#8212; I think he is focused on trying to convince the world that he has the ability to change the dynamics in Europe in a way that he cannot.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But I don&#8217;t &#8212; how much of it is a cover for just saying, &#8220;We&#8217;re just doing exercises&#8221; and there&#8217;s more than that, I just can&#8217;t &#8212; it&#8217;s hard to read his mind.</p>



<p>(Cross-talk.)</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To be clear &#8212; to be clear, you are convinced &#8212;</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; I&#8217;ll &#8212; I&#8217;ll take some.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; you are convinced &#8212; you are convinced that President Putin is going to invade Ukraine?&nbsp; Is that what you just said a few moments ago?</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Yes, I did.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, is diplomacy off the table then?</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; No.&nbsp; There&#8217;s always &#8212; until he does, diplomacy is always a possibility.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What reason do you have to believe he is considering that option at all?</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; We have a significant intelligence capability.&nbsp; Thank you very much.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">James S. Brady Press Briefing Room</p>



<p>2:43 P.M. EST</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Hi, everyone.&nbsp; Happy Friday.&nbsp; Okay, so we have two special guests with us today.&nbsp; Joining us are Deputy National Security Advisors Anne Neuberger and Daleep Singh.</p>



<p>By way of a quick introduction, Anne is Deputy National Security Advisor for Cyber and Emerging Technology.&nbsp; Previously, she served as the National Security Agency’s Director of Cybersecurity, where she led the NSA’s cybersecurity mission.</p>



<p>Prior to this role, Anne led NSA’s election security effort and served as Assistant Deputy Director of NSA’s Operations Directorate, overseeing foreign intelligence and cybersecurity operations.</p>



<p>Daleep is Deputy National Security Advisor for International Economics and Deputy Director of the National Economic Council.&nbsp; He coordinates the administration’s policymaking process for a range of issues at the intersection of economic policy and national security.</p>



<p>Previously, he was the Executive Vice President and Head of the Markets Group at the New York Federal Reserve, where he led the implementation for most of the Fed’s emergency facilities launched during the pandemic.</p>



<p>He served as an Acting Assistant Secretary for Domestic Finance at the Treasury Department during the Obama-Biden administration, as well as a Deputy Assistant Secretary for International Affairs.</p>



<p>They will each give brief remarks, and then we&#8217;ll take some questions.&nbsp; Your introduction won&#8217;t be as fancy the second time you come, but &#8212;</p>



<p>So, I think Anne is starting, right?</p>



<p>MS. NEUBERGER:&nbsp; Thank you very much, Jen.&nbsp; Good afternoon.&nbsp; It&#8217;s good to see you all.</p>



<p>Over the last decade, Russia has used cyber as a major part of its military activity beyond its borders, including to undermine, coerce, and destabilize Ukraine.&nbsp; For that reason, and at the President’s direction, we&#8217;ve been working to prepare for potential cyberattacks since November.&nbsp; We’ve been focused on doing so in three ways:</p>



<p>First, we&#8217;ve continued our urgent work to shore up our cyber defenses at home.&nbsp; Second, we&#8217;ve boosted our efforts providing support to Ukraine.&nbsp; And third, we&#8217;ve worked closely with partners and Allies to defend against and disrupt malicious cyber activity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I’ll expand on each of these three areas.</p>



<p>First, we’re shoring up our defenses at home.&nbsp; While there are currently no specific or credible cyber threats to the homeland, the U.S. government has been preparing for potential geopolitical contingencies since before Thanksgiving.</p>



<p>The White House has coordinated extensive outreach by agencies with the private sector, specifically private sector owners and operators of critical infrastructure.</p>



<p>In that outreach, departments and agencies have gone to unprecedented and extraordinary lengths to share sensitive information and, most importantly, to outline specific steps companies can take to make their systems more secure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As one example of those specific steps, the Department of Energy shared technical indicators of techniques used by Russian cyber actors to conduct cyberattacks against Ukrainian electricity systems during prior crises in Ukraine.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re also using the authorities we have to require companies to put in place the cyber defenses needed.&nbsp; For example, TSA issued directives that require oil and gas pipelines to report cyber incidents, conduct vulnerability assessments, and exercise their incident response plans.&nbsp; TSA is now working to expand that to both the aviation and railroad sectors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As many of you know, the government doesn’t own or operate critical infrastructure that provides critical services to our citizens &#8212; for example, our water systems and power systems.&nbsp; I cannot stress this enough: We urge our private sector partners to exercise incident response plans and put in place the cybersecurity defenses, like encryption and multifactor authentication, that make cyberattacks harder for even sophisticated cyber actors.</p>



<p>Second, we continue to support Ukraine as it works to shore up its cyber defenses.</p>



<p>The U.S. government believes that Russian cyber actors likely have targeted the U- &#8212; the Ukrainian government, including military and critical infrastructure networks, to collect intelligence and pre-position to conduct disruptive cyber activities.  These disruptive cyber operations could be leveraged if Russia takes further military action against Ukraine. </p>



<p>We&#8217;ve seen troubling signs of malicious cyber activity in the last month.  Earlier this week, we saw a kind of cyberattack known as a DDoS attack that overloads online services at the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense and state-owned banks.  There were also text messages sent to bank customers telling them that ATM services were unavailable.</p>



<p>Russia likes to move in the shadows and counts on a long process of attribution so it can continue its malicious behavior against Ukraine in cyberspace, including pre-positioning for its potential invasion.&nbsp; In light of that, we&#8217;re moving quickly to attribute the DDoS attacks.</p>



<p>We believe that the Russian government is responsible for wide-scale cyberattacks on Ukrainian banks this week.&nbsp; We have technical information that links Russian &#8212; the Russian Main Intelligence Directorate, or GRU, as known GRU infrastructure was seen transmitting high volumes of communications to Ukraine-based IP addresses and domains.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve shared the underlying intelligence with Ukraine and with our European partners.</p>



<p>While of limited impact, this recent spate of cyberattacks in Ukraine are consistent with what a Russian effort could look like in laying the groundwork for more disruptive cyberattacks accompanying a potential further invasion of Ukraine&#8217;s sovereign territory.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve been preparing for this possibility.&nbsp; Since November, we further intensified our support to the government of Ukraine, specifically to network defenders, working to help them respond to and recover from cyber incidents as well as strengthen the resilience of cyber critical infrastructure.</p>



<p>Finally, we&#8217;re cooperating with Allies and partners to disrupt and respond to malicious cyber activity.&nbsp; That includes work to share intelligence regarding malicious cyber techniques and ensure the global community is ready to rapidly call out malicious cyber activity as appropriate.</p>



<p>Members of the administration have met with leaders across the region to discuss cyber resilience, deterrence of cyberattacks, and to ensure we&#8217;re prepared to address any cyber contingencies.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve met with our Polish and Baltic counterparts; our NATO Allies; and our European partners, including France and Germany.</p>



<p>The global community must be prepared to shine a light on malicious cyber activity and hold actors accountable for any and all disruptive or destructive cyber activity.</p>



<p>And as the President said earlier this week: If Russia attacks the United States or our Allies through asymmetric activities, like disruptive cyberattacks against our companies or critical infrastructure, we are prepared to respond.</p>



<p>Thank you.</p>



<p>MR. SINGH:&nbsp; Good afternoon, everybody.&nbsp; As President Biden has said: If Russia attacks Ukraine, we will respond decisively and forcefully to impose costs on Russia, alongside our Allies and partners.</p>



<p>The cost to Russia would be immense, both to its economy and its strategic position in the world.&nbsp; Our financial sanctions have been designed to impose overwhelming and immediate costs to the largest financial institutions and state-owned enterprises in Russia.&nbsp; They’ve been calibrated to maximize alignment with our Allies and partners.&nbsp; They’re flexible to allow for further escalation or de-escalation, depending on how Putin responds.&nbsp; And they’re responsible to avoid targeting the Russian people and to limit unwanted spillovers to the U.S. and global economy.</p>



<p>We’re also prepared to impose powerful export controls as part of our response package.&nbsp; Both financial sanctions and export controls deny something to Russia that it needs and can’t get from anywhere other than the United States or our Allies and partners.&nbsp; Financial sanctions deny foreign capital to Russia, and export controls deny critical technological inputs that Russia needs to diversify its economy and to deliver on Putin’s strategic ambitions in aerospace, defense, and high-tech.<br><br>Working in tandem, financial sanctions and export controls are embedded in a broader strategy that would undercut Putin’s aspirations to project power and exert influence on the world stage.<br><br>If Russia invades Ukraine, it would become a pariah to the international community, it would become isolated from global financial markets, and it would be deprived of the most sophisticated technological inputs.<br><br>Russia would face the prospect of intense capital outflows, mounting pressure on its currency, surging inflation, higher borrowing costs, economic contraction, and the erosion of its productive capacity.<br><br>Taken together, Russia would become more dependent on countries that cannot compensate for its losses.&nbsp; This would be a strategic defeat for Russia, pure and simple.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the West and international community would emerge more united and determined to defend shared values and core principles than at any point in the post-Cold War era.<br><br>We’re ready to impose costs in lockstep with our Allies and partners because we share the belief that Russia has no right to redraw its neighbors&#8217; borders by force and that countries have the freedom to set their own course and to choose their own destiny.<br><br>To be clear: The test of unity with our Allies and partners is not whether our actions are matched to the letter or whether our implementation mechanics are identical.&nbsp; The test of unity is whether we share a recognition of the core principles that are at stake, whether we share the resolve to defend those principles by imposing severe costs on Russia for its actions, and whether we’re willing to do all we can to support each other in managing the consequences.<br><br>I can tell you with confidence that we’ve met the test.&nbsp; And on this last point, since I know many of you have asked, let me say that we are in active engagement with major energy consumers and major energy producers to coordinate potential actions, to stabilize energy markets, and all of our tools are on the table.</p>



<p>Thank you.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Okay.  Steve.<br><br>Q    Daleep, are you still discussing elements of the sanctions package among yourselves, or is the package ready to go as soon as the invasion begins?<br><br>MR. SINGH:  You know, I would say, at this point, we are &#8212; we are converging on the final package.  And anybody who has worked on sanctions in the EU or the U.S. or any of our other Allies and partners would say that the unity and coordination that we&#8217;ve seen in the past few months is unlike anything we&#8217;ve experienced.  And that&#8217;s the reason I say that the West is likely to emerge more unified and determined coming out of this episode than any point in the post-Cold War era.<br><br>Q    And could you talk a little bit about the export control measures?  How would they impact Russian electronics?<br><br>MR. SINGH:  Yeah, so the reality is that the West and open societies &#8212; this is where innovation and entrepreneurship flourish.  We produce the most sophisticated technological inputs across a range of foundational technologies &#8212; AI, quantum, biotech, hypersonic flight, robotics.<br><br>As we and our partners move in lockstep to deny these critical technology inputs to Russia&#8217;s economy, Putin&#8217;s desire to diversify outside of oil and gas &#8212; which is two thirds of his export revenue, half of his budget revenues &#8212; that will be denied.<br><br>He&#8217;s spoken many times about a desire for an aerospace sector, a defense sector, an IT sector.  Without these critical technology inputs, there is no path to realizing those ambitions.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Kristen.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you so much.&nbsp; Anne, this is a follow-up for you, if I can.&nbsp; It sounds like &#8212; and just to put a finer point on this &#8212; you have assessed now that Russia was behind the cyberattacks against the Defense Ministry and the banks in Ukraine.&nbsp; Can you tell us, specifically, when you assessed that, how extensive it was?&nbsp;<br><br>And obviously, you’ve been warning for days that that type of an action could be a precursor to a Russian invasion.&nbsp; Have you been able to determine whether those actions were taken to send a signal that, yes, we are going to invade?</p>



<p>MS. NEUBERGER:&nbsp; So, yes, we &#8212; we have assessed that Russia was responsible for the distributed denial-of-service attacks that occurred earlier this week.&nbsp; And I will note that the speed with which we made that attribution, as you note, is very unusual.&nbsp; And we&#8217;ve done so because of a need to call out the behavior quickly as part of holding nations accountable when they conduct disruptive or destabilizing cyber activity.<br><br>You asked how extensive that activity was.&nbsp; It was of limited impact because Ukrainian cyber defenders rapidly brought back the &#8212; both the state-owned banks and the Ministry of Defense networks.&nbsp; And indeed, we have provided support to our &#8212; those Ukrainian network defenders to ensure that they are prepared for even more potentially extensive behaviors or activities.<br><br>And then finally, we do believe, as I noted, that Russia does use cyber as part of its projecting force, whether that is influencing, coercing, or destabilizing.&nbsp; So we do expect that should Russia decide to proceed with a further invasion of Ukraine, we may see further destabilizing or destructive cyber activity.&nbsp; And we&#8217;ve been working closely with Allies and partners to ensure we&#8217;re prepared to call out that behavior and respond when needed.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One quick follow, if I can.&nbsp; You talked about the extensive steps that you have taken and that you have tried to encourage the private sector to take as well to be prepared for potential cyberattacks.&nbsp; Are you confident &#8212; is the private sector prepared?&nbsp; Is the U.S. government prepared for a Russian cyberattack?&nbsp; Can Americans feel as though their money is safe and that U.S. entities are safe?</p>



<p>MS. NEUBERGER:&nbsp; We are confident that we have worked closely with the private sector to press critical infrastructure owners and operators in the private sector to take the necessary steps to deploy cyber defenses.<br><br>We&#8217;ve shared sensitive information.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve shared, most importantly, the specific steps.&nbsp; And we&#8217;ve exercised the maximum of government authorities to mandate those steps as needed.&nbsp; We know that should anything occur, we&#8217;ll work closely with the private sector to rapidly respond and recover.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Kayla.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you so much.&nbsp; I have a question for each of you, but I&#8217;ll ask Daleep first.&nbsp; The administration and other world leaders have said now for months that sanctions will be swift and severe, and they will be the most powerful deterrent to an invasion.&nbsp; But now, with all of these signs that an invasion is going to come in the next few days or is likely, is that a sign that Vladimir Putin has calculated that the cost is bearable for Russia?<br><br>MR. SINGH:&nbsp; You know, look, I know there&#8217;s a lot of talk about whether Russia has a sanctions-proof economy, and there really is no such thing as a sanctions-proof economy.<br><br>If you &#8212; if you think about the term “sanctions-proof,” it means that a country is deciding to deintegrate from the global financial system.&nbsp; That means less foreign capital, higher borrowing costs, less investment, and lower growth.<br><br>And look, whether you&#8217;re an autocrat or small-“d” democrat, every leader cares about your economic conditions.&nbsp; It&#8217;s part of the social contract you have with your people.&nbsp; And let&#8217;s think about the baseline in Russia.&nbsp;<br><br>Right now, Russia has an inflation rate of 8.7 percent.&nbsp; The Central Bank of Russia has raised interest rates eight times over the past year to 9.5 percent.&nbsp; The ruble is the worst performer among any emerging market currency.&nbsp; That&#8217;s before &#8212; that&#8217;s before any sanctions have been imposed.&nbsp;<br><br>And if we impose these sanctions, which are the most severe measures we&#8217;ve ever contemplated against Russia, you don&#8217;t have to take my word for what would happen; look back to 2014 with a much less severe package.&nbsp; We saw record capital outflows.&nbsp; We saw a weakening of the ruble by up to 50 percent.&nbsp; We saw Russia spend 25 percent of its foreign reserves in a futile attempt to defend the ruble.&nbsp; We saw interest rates spike to 17 percent.&nbsp; We saw inflation spike to 17 percent.&nbsp; And the economy fell into recession.&nbsp; And the vicious feedback loop we saw in 2014 was determined by Putin’s own choices, not prescribed in advance by us.&nbsp; The more he escalates, the more pain he feels.<br><br>So, look, there&#8217;s no question in my mind that Putin is not playing a winning &#8212; winning hand.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s not just sanctions.&nbsp; The export controls deny him the critical technologies he needs to develop his economy over time.&nbsp; If he invades, Europe is going to accelerate its diversification away from Russian energy supplies; we’ll fortify NATO&#8217;s eastern flank.</p>



<p>All of these actions, not just sanctions, deal Putin a very weak strategic hand.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you. &nbsp;And, Anne, you said that if Russia targets companies or institutions here, and I&#8217;m wondering what intelligence the U.S. has that it can share about how that may figure into Russia&#8217;s campaign.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. NEUBERGER:&nbsp; So, as I said, there are no specific or credible cyber threats against the homeland.&nbsp; But we&#8217;re making clear that we&#8217;re preparing for that in case of any contingencies.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Ed?&nbsp; Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; But on that note, what&#8217;s your level of concern that there could be an online or cyberattack against, say, the banking system in the U.S. should Russia decide to invade?</p>



<p>MS. NEUBERGER:&nbsp; As we know &#8212; you know, as a society, we&#8217;re a very connected and digitized society, and that as a society, we don&#8217;t have the level of cyber resilience that we wish to.</p>



<p>Since the beginning of the administration, President Biden has made both domestic and physical resilience a priority, and we&#8217;ve urgently taken significant steps, whether they are new authorities, the President&#8217;s executive order, working closely with the private sector in unprecedented ways.&nbsp; Those serve as a foundation for a far stronger domestic cyber resilience we have today than at the beginning of the administration.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But on the other hand, one should always prepare for any contingencies, and we&#8217;ve been doing so &#8212; sharing sensitive information, encouraging private sector owners and operators to do the work they need to do to lock their digital doors and, essentially, do the equivalent of putting on an alarm so one can rapidly identify if there is an intruder and quickly contain and respond.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have you already seen that probing from Russia?</p>



<p>MS. NEUBERGER:&nbsp; We consistently see probing activity.&nbsp; I think the Department of Defense talks about the millions of probes it receives consistently from criminal and nation-state attackers.&nbsp; We see that regularly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The key is to have the resilience to be able to detect and rapidly recover from any destructive or destabilizing activity.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Phil?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, usually those sanctions affect the ordinary people.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve seen them in Africa and the other countries.&nbsp; Are you concerned that the sanctions that you may impose on Russia may end up affecting ordinary people and not Putin himself?</p>



<p>MR. SINGH:&nbsp; Yeah, I mentioned some of the &#8212; we have a set of guiding principles that drive our design of sanctions.&nbsp; They need to be strong enough to demonstrate our resolve.&nbsp; We calibrate them to maximize the chance of coordinating with allies and partners.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They&#8217;re also responsible.&nbsp; We target them carefully to avoid even the appearance of targeting the average Russian civilian.&nbsp; And where you&#8217;ll see these sanctions applied is on the commanding heights of the Russian economy and the Russian state.&nbsp; That&#8217;s where they&#8217;re designed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so, where you see most of the force of sanctions back in 2014 and where you&#8217;ll see them again now is through the financial sector and in areas where Putin needs critical technologies to develop an industrial base.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That&#8217;s where these measures are concentrated.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s meant to be responsible, not to have contagion to the average Russian civilian.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Phil.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then you just returned from West Africa.&nbsp; You went in DRC.&nbsp; And we see in Africa &#8212; we have coups in Africa &#8212; people (inaudible) an attempted coup.&nbsp; Is there anything the U.S. can do &#8212; maybe relocating Africans from Germany to Africa?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MR. SINGH:&nbsp; Well, our efforts in Africa and across the developing world are to give countries a better choice than they&#8217;ve been receiving.&nbsp; So we are &#8212; we&#8217;re on the road offering infrastructure finance that expresses our values &#8212; so, finance that is transparent, that&#8217;s inclusive, that’s sustainable; infrastructure financing that has high labor standards, high environmental standards; and infrastructure finance that mobilizes our private sector, which is our key competitive advantage.</p>



<p>For too long, countries have not had a choice.&nbsp; They&#8217;ve had an opaque course of &#8212; an extractive model of infrastructure finance, and that&#8217;s why we&#8217;re out to compete: because we think we have a better product.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Phil.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But can you say why the launch has been delayed though by &#8212; Daleep &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; If we can just try to &#8212; because we&#8217;re going to get through as many people as possible, and that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re trying to do here.</p>



<p>Okay. &nbsp;Go ahead, Phil.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One for each of you if you don’t mind.&nbsp; Anne, you alluded to this, but the U.S. has assessed that the Russians likely have a foothold into critical Ukrainian infrastructure on the cyberspace right now.&nbsp; Is it the expectation or is it a likelihood that they will once again try and shut down Ukrainian power?&nbsp; And if so, is that considered a red line for the U.S. in terms of a cyber operation response?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. NEUBERGER:&nbsp; So, Russia has used offensive cyber activity to coerce and disrupt critical infrastructure in Ukraine during a prior crisis.&nbsp; So we would expect, based on prior activity, that should Russia decide to proceed with an invasion of Ukraine &#8212; and I want to be clear that our priority, as the President has noted, is really exercising every diplomatic option possible to avoid that &#8212; we are prepared for and have been working with Ukrainians and our European allies and partners to help the Ukrainians prepare for potential destructive or destabilizing activity.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And would that be a red line for the &#8212; like, for the U.S. in terms of its cyber response?</p>



<p>MS. NEUBERGER:&nbsp; I think as the President has made clear, disruptive or destructive attacks against the U.S. or allies is of significant concern.&nbsp; It&#8217;s outside the boundaries of international norms, particularly attacks against critical infrastructure.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Ukraine isn’t an ally.&nbsp; Does that mean you &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Guys, if you could &#8212; we’re going to get to as many as possible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Daleep &#8212; Daleep &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; It doesn’t help to scream over each other.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Daleep, real quick &#8212; and I think you alluded to this at the end of your opening statement &#8212; but we just heard from the Prime Minister of Italy, Mario Draghi, say that “sanctions should be focused on [a] limited number of sectors…without including energy.”&nbsp; Do you view that as a one-off?&nbsp; How do you address the fact that the different countries, particularly in Europe, have different equities here to try and actually stay unified as, you say, the West is right now?</p>



<p>MR. SINGH: &nbsp;Look, I&#8217;ll speak to the energy question.&nbsp; First of all, our measures are not designed to reduce or impair Russia&#8217;s ability to supply energy to the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Number two, we think it would be a strategic mistake for Putin to weaponize his energy supply.&nbsp; Two thirds of Russia&#8217;s exports and half of its budget revenues come from oil and gas. And if Putin were to weaponize his energy supply, it would only accelerate the diversification of the world away from Russian energy consumption.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Number three, we&#8217;re prepared for anything.&nbsp; So, if &#8212; if Russia decides to weaponize its energy supply, we&#8217;re ready.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve been taking steps, as I mentioned in my statement, to coordinate with major energy consumers, major energy producers to ensure that we have steady energy supplies and we have stable energy markets.</p>



<p>On natural gas, we&#8217;ve been working with Europe in lockstep to surge natural gas to Europe from North Africa, from the Middle East, from other parts of Europe, from the U.S., and from Asia.&nbsp; And we&#8217;ve succeeded in largely compensating for any shortfall that could unfold if gas that flows to Ukraine is cut.</p>



<p>But the last point I&#8217;ll make &#8212; it&#8217;s maybe the most fundamental one: Policy involves trade-offs.&nbsp; And the President said this week he&#8217;s not going to pretend that this is all painless.</p>



<p>But think of the counterfactual.&nbsp; Think if Russia&#8217;s aggression in the heart of Europe went unchecked.&nbsp; Possibly the largest land invasion in the post-Cold War era.&nbsp; Think of the uncertainties that would cause.&nbsp; Think of the chilling effect that would cause across the European continent.&nbsp; Think of the questions that will be asked about which other countries could be bullied by an autocrat looking to exert a sphere of influence.&nbsp; Those are costs we&#8217;re not willing to tolerate.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Rachel.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just a quick follow-up to some of the intelligence that you mentioned.&nbsp; I know you said right now the administration is confident that there is no threat level to the United States, but how quickly do you expect that to change if there is an invasion and if and when sanctions are imposed?</p>



<p>MS. NEUBERGER:&nbsp; I won&#8217;t get into the hypotheticals.&nbsp; What I will say is that we&#8217;ve focused on maximum preparedness across government systems, across private sectors, critical infrastructure, both in the United States and working closely with our Allies and partners.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Weijia.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Anne, can you talk about what companies in the private sector are the most vulnerable?&nbsp; Obviously, you&#8217;ve talked about banking.&nbsp; You’ve talked a little bit about the water systems.&nbsp; But what other ones do you consider to be most at-risk right now?&nbsp; And then I have a question for Daleep too.</p>



<p>MS. NEUBERGER:&nbsp; Absolutely.&nbsp; So, generally, as we look at ourselves as a society, we know that critical infrastructure is our focus &#8212; to rapidly improve our domestic resilience because of the degree to which critical services like power and water touch citizens across the United States.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And that&#8217;s why some of the most urgent and innovative efforts that the President has initiated this year have focused on those sectors &#8212; from the Industrial Control Systems effort, to TSA’s first exercise of its emergency authorities, to NERC issuing an alert earlier this week for the utility sector as well.</p>



<p>So that is really the critical infrastructure.&nbsp; Particularly, power, communications and water have been a clear focus because of the fact that they touch Americans lives and because of the need to address the fact that these sectors digitized quickly, and we need to catch up from a security and resilience, which we have made significant progress on in this first year.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; And, Daleep, a quick question on the export tool: What technologies and products can the U.S. and Allies withhold from Putin that he can&#8217;t get elsewhere &#8212; for example, from China?</p>



<p>MR. SINGH:&nbsp; We think we have an asymmetric advantage when it comes to the foundational technologies of our time.&nbsp; So, think of AI, semiconductors, quantum, robotics, hypersonic flight.&nbsp; These are products that, in almost every case, are designed and produced in the West and in open societies.&nbsp; We define the productive frontier.&nbsp; So, there really is no ability for Russia to replace or compensate for the denial of these inputs from anywhere else, including China.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Patsy.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah, actually, just to follow up on the China question &#8212; I mean, as we&#8217;re dealing with the threats of Russia, we know that you&#8217;ve also been doing these tours to Africa and South America, in terms of promoting the Build Back Better World to counter the Belt and Road Initiative.&nbsp; Can you share a little bit &#8212; the level of interest to this program from the countries that you visited?&nbsp; And why has there been a holdup?&nbsp; Because the promise was that it will be launched earlier &#8212; early this week &#8212; this year.</p>



<p>MR. SINGH:&nbsp; Yeah, I&#8217;ll say there&#8217;s been enormous enthusiasm in every country we visited: Ecuador, Colombia, Panama, Ghana, Senegal, the DRC, parts of the Middle East, Indonesia, Thailand, and other parts of the world.&nbsp; And the reason there&#8217;s so much enthusiasm is that countries do want a choice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For a long time, China has been the only game in town for many of these countries.&nbsp; And in many cases, they have buyers regret.&nbsp; The loans that have been made to these countries have often been very opaque.&nbsp; They have non-disclosure agreements.&nbsp; They have termination clauses.&nbsp; They have confiscatory collateral arrangements.&nbsp; They&#8217;re extractive, in many cases &#8212; in the DRC, for example.&nbsp; This is a country that&#8217;s rich in minerals &#8212; over $20 trillion in critical minerals &#8212; but they&#8217;ve not seen the schools, the roads, the hospitals, the bridges they were promised.</p>



<p>And so, we&#8217;re offering a different way with, as I say, high standards for transparency; inclusivity; development impact &#8212; local development impact; and very, very strong attention to the labor market impacts and environmental standards.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, you know, so we&#8217;re mobilizing along with our G7 partners, and we are going to launch early this year.&nbsp; You should see very soon a list of flagship projects that will exemplify exactly what Build Back Better World is all about.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Jacqui.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Can you clarify: Is removing Russia from the SWIFT international banking system part of the financial sanctions package?</p>



<p>MR. SINGH:&nbsp; Well, all options remain on the table.&nbsp; But it&#8217;s probably not going to be the case that you&#8217;ll see SWIFT in the initial rollout package.&nbsp; We have other severe measures we can take that our Allies and partners are ready to take in lockstep with us, and that don&#8217;t have the same spillover effects.&nbsp; But we always will monitor these options, and we’ll &#8212; we’ll revise our judgments as time goes on.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I thought you guys had said you were going to start at the maximum &#8212; that it wouldn&#8217;t be like a &#8212; you know, a ramping up of sanctions.</p>



<p>MR. SINGH:&nbsp; I can assure you the measures that we have prepared &#8212; the severity of those measures, and the institutions that we would impose them upon, and the immediacy of those sanctions &#8212; are among the most severe financial sanctions that have ever been contemplated.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Josh.&nbsp; It&#8217;s going to be the last one.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the sanctions: If they’re severe as you say, how do you protect against the risks that Russia&#8217;s economy becomes stitched even tighter with China or others who might be able to avoid what the U.S. is doing?</p>



<p>MR. SINGH:&nbsp; So, you can look at this question from both perspectives.&nbsp; From Russia&#8217;s perspective, if it wants to sequester itself from Western economies, Western technology, and Western capital markets, and try to substitute China for all that we provide, that&#8217;s a very bad miscalculation.&nbsp; The G7 alone represents more than 50 percent of the global economy.&nbsp; China is 15 percent.</p>



<p>If you look at the Dollar, the Euro, the British Pound, and the Yen &#8212; these are the dominant reserve currencies of the world.&nbsp; It’s how the world makes payments.&nbsp; It’s how it saves money.&nbsp; It’s how the world borrows money.&nbsp; The Renminbi here on these metrics is in the low single digits.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And if you think about the foundational technologies of our time, they are, in almost all cases, designed or produced by the West and open societies where innovation and entrepreneurship flourish.</p>



<p>So, there is I don&#8217;t think any question that China could not be a substitute for all the West provides.</p>



<p>Now, for China&#8217;s part, if it decides to give tacit or explicit accommodation to the invasion of the sovereign nation in the heart of Europe, that would be a very bad signal for its vision of the world.&nbsp; The reputational effects that would have in Europe would be profound.&nbsp; The signals it would send all across the world about its willingness to accommodate coercion and force and aggression would have very long-lasting effects.</p>



<p>And let&#8217;s be real: The Russian economy is one tenth the size of the EU &#8212; one fifteenth the size of the U.S. economy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, China may want Russia as its junior partner for cheap gas or cheap oil, but let&#8217;s not pretend it&#8217;s anything else.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I do a follow-up question, as well?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Thank you, both, so much.&nbsp; I appreciate it.&nbsp; I think we have to wrap it up because they have to head back and do some work.&nbsp; Thank you both so much for joining us.</p>



<p>MR. SINGH:&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>MS. NEUBERGER:&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks so much.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Okay, I just have one item for all of you at the top &#8212; a week ahead.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This weekend, including Presidents’ Day on Monday, the President will remain in D.C. throughout &#8212; obviously at the White House &#8212; throughout next week, the President will continue close coordination with our Allies and partners on Russia&#8217;s potential further invasion of Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On Tuesday, the President will host an event announcing progress on reshoring critical supply chains, powering clean energy manufacturing, and creating good-paying jobs.</p>



<p>And on Thursday, the President will participate in a virtual G7 leaders meeting to discuss the ongoing situation with regard to Russia and Ukraine and priorities of the German G7 presidency this year.</p>



<p>With that, I will try to jump around as much as I can.</p>



<p>Josh, do you want to kick us off, though?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; Two questions.&nbsp; The first one: Has the President read the Russian response on Ukraine, and is he giving any consideration to mobilizing additional troops in Europe?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, on the first part, I know that, as you all know, our Secretary of State has accepted the invitation to have a meeting with Foreign Minister Lavrov &#8212; or engage with him, next Wednesday, and certainly we are continuing to review.</p>



<p>In terms of the President&#8217;s status or process there, I don&#8217;t have anything to update you on.&nbsp; We have always said from the beginning that we are open to sending more troops should that be needed.&nbsp; But I don&#8217;t have any update on that front.&nbsp; I would point to the Department of Defense.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, secondly, real quick: Separatists in Ukraine are evacuating civilians to Russia.&nbsp; Secretary Blinken warned about this as a type of false-flag operation.&nbsp; Now that you&#8217;re seeing these operations, does that mean a further invasion is forthcoming, if not inevitable?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would first say that we believe &#8212; we continue to believe, as you heard our Secretary of State say yesterday, that Russia is positioned to attack Ukraine in the coming days.&nbsp; And that remains the case &#8212; just what the Secretary said yesterday.&nbsp; Obviously, the President will be speaking shortly to all of you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the same time, the door to diplomacy remains open and it will continue to remain open.&nbsp; And, again, we &#8212; as is evidenced by the fact that our Secretary of State is planning to engage with the foreign minister.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But in terms of &#8212; in terms of these reports, yes, it is a good example of what we&#8217;re seeing &#8212; or what we have long anticipated and long predicted for all of you: that the Russians would take part in pretexts or steps that would lay a predicate for either war or to create confusion or spread misinformation on the ground about what&#8217;s actually happening on the ground.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think, again, it&#8217;s important to remember that they have been &#8212; we would consider eastern Ukraine &#8212; that the war began in eastern Ukraine back in 2014.&nbsp; We&#8217;re not waiting.&nbsp; It&#8217;s already began, back in 2014.&nbsp; There have been Russian separatists there.&nbsp; There have been efforts to spread misinformation and to create these pretexts for some time now.&nbsp; But certainly, we continue to watch closely.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it wise for President Zelenskyy to leave Ukraine to attend the Munich Conference?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; That is a decision for him to make.&nbsp; But regardless of what decision he makes, he will find a strong partner in the United States.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And what does the President want to hear from the transatlantic?&nbsp; I think the call is going on right now.&nbsp; What &#8212; what &#8212; is he going to talk about sanctions?&nbsp; What are they going to talk about?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I think you have all seen the President engage quite a bit &#8212; extensively, I should say &#8212; in conversations, video conferences, calls with his counterparts around the world to ensure that we remain lockstep and coordinated and united.&nbsp; And that doesn&#8217;t happen on its own.&nbsp; It happens through a lot of work and effort and a lot of direction by the President of the United States.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So this is an effort to have a conversation with his counterparts about what we&#8217;re seeing, where things stand, and continue that close coordination that has been ongoing for months now.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just one question.&nbsp; There was a readout from Brett and Amos’s meeting &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; in the Middle East.&nbsp; And in that readout, it says they discussed with the Saudis a “collaborative approach to managing potential market pressures” if Russia invades.&nbsp; Can you give any details?&nbsp; Was anything concrete agreed to?&nbsp; Were there any promises made?&nbsp; What does the “collaborative approach” mean when it comes to the Saudis and the U.S.?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would say a “collaborative approach” means trying to prevent impacts on the energy markets if there is a shortage as a result of an invasion.&nbsp; There are lots of ways to achieve that, and that was certainly part of the discussion.&nbsp; But I don&#8217;t have any more details beyond what was in the readout.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I would also note that in the readout, they also conveyed that a big part of their discussion was also related to Yemen, also related to Iran.&nbsp; So there are a range of topics that were discussed.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And just to clarify: Is this the beginning of that discussion about a potential collaborative approach midway through or close to a final agreement?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I expect &#8212; we expect certainly our conversations with the Saudis will be ongoing.&nbsp; And the effort will be focused on ensuring that we&#8217;re in full coordination to handle any energy market pressures that could arise.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.&nbsp; When we heard from President Biden yesterday, he had not yet read the written response from the Russians.&nbsp; Assuming that he has now, has that changed his assessment at all about the possibility of diplomacy?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I think Josh asked a similar question, but I would just say I don&#8217;t have an update on the internal discussions about the Russian response other than to convey that, as our Secretary of State noted yesterday, he has accepted the offer to &#8212; or he is &#8212; he will be engaging, I should say, with his counterpart, his Russian counterpart, on Wednesday, unless, of course, they invade.&nbsp; And there will continue to be a range of diplomatic discussions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think the Secretary of State was also very clear yesterday about the fact that we believe that Russia is positioned to attack Ukraine.&nbsp; They, of course, could change their mind, or they could decide not to, and we are going to remain &#8212; keep the door to diplomacy open, as we should.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But again, there&#8217;s no new assessment beyond what the Secretary of State said yesterday, which was quite forward-leaning, as I think you would all agree.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q    Thanks, Jen.  Has the U.S. in any way conveyed to Ukraine that it should not respond to the provocations by Russia?  We&#8217;re obviously seeing the increased shelling that’s happening right now.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  And they have not, I think as you have seen.  You know, I think we are &#8212; have been speaking vocally and privately, of course, about our expectation of these types of provocations and what their intended purpose is and whether their intended purpose is to create confusion; whether it is to create, you know, irritation; whether it is to prompt a response.  Obviously, that would not be a positive step at this point in time.<br><br>Q    And so you have conveyed that privately to the Ukrainians or (inaudible)?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  We have &#8212; we have conveyed that, certainly, in a range of ways.<br><br>Q    Okay.  And let me just, if I could, go back to the meeting between the Secretary of State and Lavrov that may happen next week.  What gives the administration hope that there&#8217;s still a path for diplomacy when the President has said that an invasion is all but certain to happen in the next few days?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, we hope we&#8217;re wrong.&nbsp; You know, we hope that &#8212; if Russia doesn&#8217;t invade, we will be relieved.&nbsp; That would certainly be a good outcome.&nbsp; But at the same time, what&#8217;s the alternative?&nbsp; Us not to say we’ll &#8212; we will agree to diplomacy or diplomatic opportunities?<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have you gotten any assurances from Russian officials that they won&#8217;t invade until Lavrov meets with Secretary Blinken?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Again, Kristen, I think, as we&#8217;ve said in the past, I mean, it&#8217;s not just about what is said &#8212; they&#8217;ve said that publicly; it&#8217;s about what they do.&nbsp; And so, we continue to believe that they are positioned to invade Ukraine.&nbsp; If they decide not to, that is certainly a positive step.&nbsp; And we have a responsibility to the global community, to Ukrainians to leave the door to diplomacy open.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I could try one more time, on Zelenskyy.&nbsp; We do have reporting that a number of administration officials are concerned about him leaving at this critical moment.&nbsp; Obviously, he&#8217;s also scheduled to meet with the Vice President.&nbsp; Has anyone in this administration conveyed directly to Zelenskyy that there are concerns about him leaving right now?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I&#8217;m just not going to detail any private diplomatic conversations.&nbsp; But again, I’d reiterate it&#8217;s a decision that is up to him to make.&nbsp; That would &#8212; is what we convey privately as well.&nbsp; And regardless of what decision he makes, he will remain &#8212; he will have the support of the United States.<br><br>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the Blinken/Lavrov meeting, does the administration see this as a precursor to some kind of leaders summit, or perhaps a phone call between the President and Putin or a face-to-face meeting?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I think where we are right now is that, you know, we are unclear &#8212; we&#8217;re ready to engage in diplomacy, but it&#8217;s unclear if the Russians are going to sit down in good faith.&nbsp; And, of course, if &#8212; while we are doing everything we can to prevent war, and including having the Secretary of State willing to engage further with his Russian counterpart, I don&#8217;t think we can get ahead of the process or ahead of where things stand, which is our continued belief that they&#8217;re positioned to attack Ukraine.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And President Bolsonaro of Brazil met with Putin this week in Moscow.&nbsp; He expressed solidarity with Russia.&nbsp; I know the State Department put something out.&nbsp; But did the President feel betrayed by President Bolsonaro’s comments?&nbsp; And does this affect U.S.-Brazilian relations at all?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I&#8217;ve not discussed his comments with the President.&nbsp; But what I would say is that the vast majority of the global community is united in their view &#8212; a shared view that invading another country, attempting to take some of their land, terrorizing their people is certainly not aligned with global values.&nbsp; And so, I think Brazil may be on the other side of where the majority of the global community stands.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There’s a report in Foreign Policy magazine that Russia intends to target Ukrainian politicians and dissidents for assassination or arrest.&nbsp; Are you aware of any plans to provide security for President Zelenskyy or others?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I&#8217;ve seen those reports &#8212; we&#8217;ve seen those reports, and I can&#8217;t, of course, speak to intelligence matters or hypotheticals.&nbsp; We would be very concerned about any actions that would target political critics or vulnerable populations, as I think is what that report is conveying, if I&#8217;m correct, such as religious and ethnic minorities or LGBTQ persons.<br><br>We have, in the past, seen Russia try to force acquiescence through intimidation and repression.&nbsp; But given it’s a hypothetical and I can&#8217;t speak to it further, I can&#8217;t give you any prediction of security assistance.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to ask you a question about gas prices specifically.&nbsp; Can you explain, if there is any, the reticence to embrace the calls for the gas tax holiday?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, we&#8217;ve said every option is on the table, including that.&nbsp; But a decision has not been made.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there any reticence here to do that?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s called reticence.&nbsp; It&#8217;s just that a decision hasn&#8217;t been made in the process yet.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just checking.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; Just a quick follow-up on the Russian response.&nbsp; Has the President reviewed it yet?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Again, I don&#8217;t have any update on that.&nbsp; What I can tell you is that our efforts remain having continued diplomatic conversations with our counterparts in Russia, as is evidenced by the Secretary of State&#8217;s plans for next Wednesday &#8212; unless they, of course, invade &#8212; and the President&#8217;s engagements that he is a part of at this point in time.</p>



<p>But I think it&#8217;s important to note that, you know, when we look at how we&#8217;re going to engage in diplomacy, it&#8217;s also important that we look at how Russia is responding.&nbsp; Right?&nbsp; And Russia&#8217;s threats of war if their demands aren&#8217;t met are inconsistent with diplomacy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, we are going to leave the door open, but I think the Secretary of State&#8217;s commitment to &#8212; or openness to meeting &#8212; or to engaging with his counterpart is evidence of that.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I know you got a question on the call that&#8217;s</p>



<p>happening as we speak, probably, with the transatlantic leaders. Just on the President&#8217;s framing of this: Does he see this as getting the Allies on the same page as a final check-in before an anticipated invasion, given that he said he&#8217;s expecting it within the next several days?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; It&#8217;s a part of our ongoing engagement, so I wouldn&#8217;t put it in those terms.&nbsp; He &#8212; the &#8212; or we are united; we are with our Allies.&nbsp; I think you will hear him convey that when he speaks to all of you shortly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But it is also important to stay in close touch.&nbsp; I wouldn&#8217;t say this is the last time he&#8217;s going to talk with them or talk with these counterparts in the coming days at all.&nbsp; He&#8217;s been talking with his counterparts nearly every single day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the point we&#8217;re at right now is, of course, over the last few days, we&#8217;ve seen reports of rapid &#8212; a rapid uptick of violence; violations of the ceasefire agreement, including the shelling of a Ukrainian kindergarten yesterday; more and more disinformation is being pushed out to the public.&nbsp; We know this is consistent with the playbook for invasion, and we believe they&#8217;re positioned to attack.</p>



<p>So, of course, it&#8217;s an important moment to have a conversation with his counterparts, but I would expect those to be ongoing.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did you accidentally leave off of the week ahead the President&#8217;s interviews of Supreme Court &#8212; Supreme Court candidates?&nbsp; (Laughter.)</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Very good.&nbsp; I was like, I may &#8212; I&#8217;m thinking, “Maybe I left something off.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Well, I can tell you that February is not that much longer; it&#8217;s 10 days if my math is correct.&nbsp; And we remain on track to &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But that was like &#8212; that was going to be my &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; &#8212; to make an announcement about a Supreme Court &#8212; the President&#8217;s selection for a qualified and credible nominee to serve on the Supreme Court ju- &#8212; before the end of the month.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; And then that was my following question, which is &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; which is that, given what&#8217;s go- &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; what seems poised to go on with Ukraine, is there any thought that if there is an invasion, the President would delay the announcement of the Supreme Court pick given, you know, what else could be going on at the time?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, you know how I love hypotheticals, but what I will tell you is that he has every intention of making a decision this month.&nbsp; He&#8217;s on track to do so.&nbsp; That will mean he will have chosen a nominee faster than any Democratic President in decades.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And obviously, he&#8217;s somebody who has to, as leader of the free world and President of the United States, conduct business on a number of fronts at the same time.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Jumping off of that, actually: Yesterday in the briefing, it was mentioned that the President was planning to begin interviewing nominees as soon as this week.&nbsp; Given that we are on Friday, can you confirm if he did or did not interview anybody this week?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I&#8217;m just not going to provide you a day-to-day update, but I can tell you that this is not going to be that much longer lasting because we only have 10 more days left of the month.&nbsp; So that&#8217;s the good news.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And it is always a late part of the process &#8212; the interviews &#8212; but I&#8217;m not going to be able to give you an update on that from here.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One other thing.&nbsp; On COVID, I believe that only four, maybe five states still have indoor mask mandates as it holds right now.&nbsp; And I know that you all have been saying you&#8217;re going to follow the CDC’s guidance, but is there a point where the CDC’s guidance is out of step with a vast majority of what states across the country are doing?&nbsp; And how do you all reconcile that?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, what I can tell you is the CDC guidance follows data and science, and data and science moves at the speed of data and science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can speak to any local leaders about what their decision-making has been based on.&nbsp; And we certainly respect their right to do that and respect their role in making decisions about their communities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But we&#8217;ve said that the CDC is reviewing the guidance.&nbsp; They have been doing that.&nbsp; And they&#8217;re going to base any recommendations they make on science.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, is the assumption though that Democratic governors and Republican governors in all these states are not basing decisions on data and science?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I can&#8217;t speak for how they&#8217;re making their decisions.&nbsp; I can speak for how we make our decisions from the federal government, which is to base it on data and science.&nbsp; And the CDC is the federal government&#8217;s entity where we &#8212; where we have all of our data and science housed.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; The former Minneapolis &#8212; or suburban Minneapolis Police officer who was convicted of fatally shooting Daunte Wright was sentenced to two years in prison today.&nbsp; Is the President keeping track of this?&nbsp; Is he aware of this sentence?&nbsp; And does he think that this was a sentence that was fitting for this crime?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, what I can say is that Daunte Wright should be here with his family and loved ones, and his death was the tragic result of a law enforcement officer’s error.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We know we have a long way to go when it comes to criminal justice and racial equity in this country.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why we are committed to not only engaging in conversations about meaningful policing reform, but we will also continue to ensure that the law enforcement agencies have the resources they need to properly train and equip officers to protect our communities.&nbsp; But I&#8217;m not going to speak to the specifics of the sentencing outcome.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then one more on the State of the Union, which is obviously right around the corner.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yes.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you talk a little bit about what specifically the President is doing to prepare for that, what tone he is hoping to set in that speech, what message he&#8217;s hoping to send to the country?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I expect we will have more as we get a little bit closer.&nbsp; I will say that as the President is in Washington, D.C. this weekend, at the White House, he will, of course, be closely monitoring developments in Ukraine, but he will also be, you know, working toward making a &#8212; finalizing his decision-making process as it relates to a Supreme Court justice nominee, and certainly preparing for the State of the Union as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So I expect as we get a little bit closer to next week, we&#8217;ll have more to say.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Back on Russia-Ukraine, the U.S. language seems to have changed from “imminent” to “highly likely” back to “imminent” again.&nbsp; Is that because you&#8217;re trying to second guess Vladimir Putin all the time, or were you closer to the escalation at one point?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I would say that, several weeks ago, I think for maybe a day, we used the word “imminent,” and we believe we sent the wrong message; that was not intended.</p>



<p>Our intended message we were sending at that time was that &#8212; was that he was &#8212; it was an option or he was prepared to.</p>



<p>Obviously, things have developed since then.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve seen a rapid uptick of violations of the ceasefire agreement.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve seen an increase in troops building at the border.&nbsp; And certainly, we&#8217;ve seen an esc- &#8212; escalatory actions.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why our Secretary of State went to the United Nations yesterday.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, what we&#8217;re seeing is further progress for the regression over the last several days.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two questions.&nbsp; One, back to Congress, as you know, Senate Republicans are blocking Federal Reserve nominees and other nominees.&nbsp; They argue that they don&#8217;t think those Federal Reserve delays have any actual effect.&nbsp; How do you respond to that?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would say: At a time where I think everyone &#8212; most people agree that inflation and costs are the top &#8212; if not one of the top &#8212; issues for every American in the country, the argument that it wouldn&#8217;t be best to have a fully confirmed full Federal Reserve Board just doesn&#8217;t seem to make a lot of sense.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then on to &#8212; on Ukraine and the idea of cyberattacks on Ukraine, can you speak to the idea of those attacks; the effect they could have on neighboring NATO countries, like Poland; and whether that kind of effect could trigger Article 5 under NATO protections or not?&nbsp; Does a cyberattack affecting NATO countries include kind of &#8212; the kind of language we see in the NATO defense (inaudible)?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I think I&#8217;m just not going to get into a hypothetical on that front.&nbsp; Obviously, they have a range of capacities.&nbsp; We work in lockstep with our NATO partners, but I&#8217;m not going to get ahead of any intended actions.</p>



<p>Go ahead, Jacqui.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; On the attempted murder of a Louisville mayoral candidate, the man who was charged with this was released on bail a couple days after this happened with the assistance of a bail fund group.&nbsp; Knowing that the Vice President has in the past supported bail fund groups, what is the White House reaction to this case?&nbsp; And should there be restrictions on which cases these bail fund groups can help, given this is attempted murder?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I would have to dig into this further, Jacqui, and I&#8217;m happy to do that after the briefing.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And on Ukraine, the sanctions, we&#8217;ve learned, don&#8217;t include SWIFT, they don&#8217;t target energy, so the impacts to other countries are mitigated.&nbsp; You guys have attributed this cyberattack to Russia, and you&#8217;re warning that the prospect of war is &#8212; or peace, rather, is pretty dim.&nbsp; So, at what point do you break away from the strategy and say it&#8217;s not working and do something else &#8212; impose some of these sanctions now?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I think as we&#8217;ve talked about a little bit in here, our collective view from our national security team is that sanctions are meant to be a deterrent.&nbsp; They are not &#8212; if you put all of the sanctions in place now, what is stopping them from invading?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But are they working?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, again, Jacqui, I think that&#8217;s our assessment from the national security team and &#8212; you know, that we will continue to implement that strategy.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So you&#8217;re waiting for people to die before implementing them in that case?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I think, Jacqui, that’s in no way a fair statement &#8212; or accusation, I guess, if that&#8217;s what that is.</p>



<p>What we have done and what the President has done is unite hundr- &#8212; countries around the world on a strong package that will be crippling to the Russian economy.&nbsp; And we have done that in a way where we have stood up for the territorial integrity of &#8212; of Ukraine, and stood with our NATO partners and Allies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It has always been up to President Putin and Russia to determine which path they were going to take.&nbsp; That has not changed.</p>



<p>But that leadership on the world stage is what has led to a united front and united opposition to these actions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I would also note that regardless of what decision President Putin decides to make, one of his intended objectives, I think, as we&#8217;ve seen out there, is to divide NATO &#8212; the opposite has happened; to divide, maybe, the United States and divide leadership in the United States &#8212; the opposite has happened.</p>



<p>So, if that was his objective, he&#8217;s already not achieving that.</p>



<p>Go ahead, Patsy.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A question on Iran.&nbsp; Earlier this week, more than 170 House Republicans wrote a letter to President Biden essentially saying that any new nuclear deals with Iran will meet the same fate as the 2015 JCPOA, meaning that the next Republican administration will just nullify it.&nbsp; Does the administration agree with this assessment?&nbsp; And are you concerned that this &#8212; this may create further complication in the talks in Vienna, which some are saying, optimistically, could wrap up in mere weeks?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, let me say, first, on the talks in Vienna, they are &#8212; continue to be in the eighth round.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a long round, I guess we could say.</p>



<p>We feel substantial progress has been made in the last week and is continuing to be made, but nothing is agreed to until everything is agreed.</p>



<p>If Iran shows seriousness, we can and should reach an understanding on mutual return to full implementation of the JCPOA within days.&nbsp; Anything much beyond that would put the possibility of return to the deal at grave risk.</p>



<p>While I&#8217;m not, certainly, going to predict &#8212; or &#8212; what it would look like in a future Republican administration, what I think is an important reminder to everyone, regardless of your political affiliation, is what happened over the last four years after the former president pulled out of the deal, which means &#8212; we &#8212; which we know what happened, which is we lost complete visibility into their capabilities.&nbsp; They made a significant amount of progress, leaving us at the point we are at today, and put us in a very difficult position in order &#8212; as we try to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.</p>



<p>So regardless of your politics, hopefully people will factor that in.&nbsp; As we look ahead &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the President planning to respond to the letter?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don’t have any information on the letter.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another follow-up on Afghanistan, just real quick, Jen.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There’s continued fighting between the Taliban and the National Resistance Front of Afghanistan, which Russia has offered to mediate.&nbsp; Do you have any reaction on both the conflict as well as Moscow&#8217;s offer?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I&#8217;ll check with our national security team and see if we can get more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thanks, everyone.&nbsp;</p>
