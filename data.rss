<p class="has-text-align-center">James S. Brady Press Briefing Room</p>



<p>3:25 P.M. EDT</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Hi, everyone.&nbsp; There&#8217;s a lot of pink in this room today.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Zeke &#8212; Zeke and Mary are going to the prom together.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Well, you know.</p>



<p>Okay, just one item for all of you at the top.</p>



<p>On Monday, the President will join the Business Roundtable CEO Quarterly Meeting at their headquarters in Washington, D.C., to discuss the United States&#8217; response to Russia&#8217;s unprovoked and unjustified war with Ukraine and the President&#8217;s plans to lower costs for working families, create good-paying union jobs, and tackle the climate crisis.</p>



<p>On Wednesday, as you all know, he will travel to Brussels, Belgium, where he will have a packed Thursday.&nbsp; He will &#8212; he&#8217;s traveling that day; there&#8217;s not a schedule that day.&nbsp; But eat your Wheaties, eat your spinach.&nbsp; It&#8217;s going to be a long Thursday &#8212; because on Thursday, to start the day, the President will attend an extraordinary NATO summit to discuss ongoing deterrence and defense efforts in response to Russia&#8217;s unprovoked and unjustified attack on Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He will also reaffirm our ironclad commitment to our NATO Allies and to defend every inch of our NATO territo- &#8212; of NATO territory.</p>



<p>Then he will join a scheduled European Council summit to discuss our shared concerns about Ukraine, including transatlantic efforts to impose economic sanctions on Russia, provide humanitarian support to those affected by the violence, and address other challenges related to the conflict.</p>



<p>Later in the day, he will attend the G7 meeting called by Germany to further discuss with our Allies and partners the consequences we are imposing on Russia for its war of choice.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ll have more announcements, I&#8217;m certain, on the trip in the days ahead.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have additional details.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve also, of course, invited our National Security Advisor, who always enjoys engaging with all of you, to join us to preview the trip early next week.&nbsp; So we&#8217;re just figuring out the date and the time depending on when the charter leaves.</p>



<p>With that, Zeke why don’t you kick us off?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No updates on the Friday schedule?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Don&#8217;t have any updates at this point in time.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On to the President&#8217;s call this morning with President Xi &#8212; does the White House now have a sense of whether or not China has decided whether to assist Russia and backfill its supplies and fulfill its request for materiel in support of its invasion of Ukraine?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I&#8217;m not going to give an assessment of that from here.&nbsp; What I can tell you is that the majority of this call, as I think you heard &#8212; you saw in the readout, and you heard, I think, on the call we just did, but was focused on Russia&#8217;s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine.</p>



<p>The President spent &#8212; the vast majority of the nearly two hours was spent with the President outlining the views of the United States and our Allies and partners on this crisis, including a detailed overview of efforts to prevent and then respond to the invasion, how we got here, steps we&#8217;ve taken, where we&#8217;ve gone, and why.</p>



<p>And, of course, as was also noted in the readout but let me just reiterate, he also conveyed and described the implications and consequences if China provides material support to Russia.&nbsp; But again, I&#8217;m not going to provide any additional assessment from here.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The President has cast the efforts to sort of build up the Western alliance as sort of, like, democracies versus autocracies.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Mm-hmm.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One very large &#8212; the largest democracy in the world is, in fact, buying Russian oil right now at a discount &#8212; expanding its purchases, taking advantage of the situation.&nbsp; Does the White House have any response to India&#8217;s purchases there?&nbsp; And does the President plan to reach out to the Indian government to try to get that decision reversed?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, we have not &#8212; while we made a decision about banning the Russian import of oil, every country has not made that decision, and we recognize that.&nbsp; And they have different economic reasoning as to why different countries do, including some in Europe.</p>



<p>We have been in touch, of course, with Indian leaders at a range of levels, not through the President.&nbsp; If that happens, we will, of course, provide that readout and information to all of you.</p>



<p>But what we would project or convey to any leader around the world is that the world &#8212; the rest of the world is watching where you&#8217;re going to stand as it relates to this conflict, whether its support for Russia in any form as they are illegally invading Ukraine.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And on a different topic.&nbsp; On COVID, (inaudible) we saw this week Pfizer request a EUA for a fourth shot or a second booster dose for seniors.&nbsp; And Moderna, last night, boosters for all adults &#8212; another round of boosters.&nbsp; Does the federal government have the money right now to purchase the doses needed to give everyone the boosters should be FDA and the CDC clear that?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, just to reiterate some of the pieces of where the process is: So, the CDC does recommend fourth doses for the immunocompromised &#8212; although it hasn&#8217;t been, of course, as you noted, approved for others &#8212; and they&#8217;re running a vigorous data-driven process. &nbsp;And right now, over 100 million Americans have been boosted; millions more have not done so and are eligible to do so and need to get boosted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But to go to your question, we&#8217;ve been clear we need additional funding from Congress.&nbsp; You&#8217;ve heard me talk about that a fair amount in here, including for the possibility of a fourth dose or a variant-specific vaccine.&nbsp; So we would indeed need additional funding to ensure that can be widely available.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the readout of this call, a senior official said that the President was really sort of laying out his assessment of the situation to President Xi, that he was making clear the implications of certain actions but that President Biden wasn&#8217;t making specific requests of China.&nbsp; Why not, given the stakes here?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Because China has to make a decision for themselves about where they want to stand and how they want the history books to look at them and view their actions.&nbsp; And that is a decision for President Xi and the Chinese to make.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Given the growing concerns about China possibly aligning with Russia, would you say it&#8217;s more concerning at this point that they would help Russia resupply, help Russia with military equipment, or that they would offer economic support to help Russia evade sanctions?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Any of those would be concerning to us, but I&#8217;m not going to give a rank-order assessment of which we&#8217;re more concerned about.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And you don&#8217;t have a sense that China may be leaning more in one direction or another?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Not an assessment I can provide from here.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And can I ask sort of a logistical question?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You know, the Chinese got out a readout of the call fairly quickly.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Before it was even done.&nbsp; (Laughter.)</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was, I think, three and a half, maybe four hours before &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Remarkable.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; before your readout was out.&nbsp; Should we read anything into the time that it took to get your side of the story out?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; So, it was a lengthy call, as you all know.&nbsp; A two-hour call is, of course, a lengthy call, even with translation.&nbsp; And what typically happens &#8212; and this time, it was a little longer than typical &#8212; but is &#8212; there&#8217;s a &#8212; you know, a meeting to discuss what happened during the meeting and assess what kind of information we can provide publicly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Obviously, we want to do as much as that as possible to all of you, but we also want to ensure we&#8217;re protecting the diplomatic channels and conversation.&nbsp; So it was an effort to do exactly that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah, I just wanted to ask &#8212; so, you know, we’ve spoken to U.S. and European diplomats who say that there&#8217;s still not exactly an agreement on what the red line would be; that &#8212; you know, what &#8212; when China would face consequences.</p>



<p>Can you say a little bit more about those discussions and whether there is agreement with G7 allies and others who have joined in about what the trigger is and what sort of consequences they would face?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, Andrea, I would say, you know, the movement of China to align with Russia or to &#8212; yeah, the movement of them to align with Russia or their proximity of moving closer together is certainly of great concern to us, as we&#8217;ve expressed.&nbsp; And we are not the only country that has expressed that concern, including many other members of the G7 have expressed exactly that concern.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So this is part of the discussion; it has been an ongoing part of the discussion.&nbsp; Expect it certainly would be when the President goes to Europe next week.&nbsp; But we&#8217;re not in a place at this point to outline the specifics.&nbsp; We&#8217;re still discussing.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, just to follow up on that: Initially, I think going into the call, we were expecting that there would be discussion about Iran and North Korea as well.&nbsp; Did the two leaders get around to those issues?&nbsp; And are they any closer in terms of alignment on those issues?</p>



<p>And then, just to your first point &#8212; or your response: One of the issues that has separated the U.S. and China over &#8212; in recent years has been disputes over trade and lots of tariffs.&nbsp; And would you anticipate that China would face a larger trade war if &#8212; or additional sanctions and tariffs if it does proceed to align closer &#8212; more closely?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, we have a range of tools that could be considered, and sanctions are certainly one tool in the toolbox, as they are for other countries as well, even if we &#8212; as we have not outlined specific consequences.&nbsp; And we’ll communicate those directly to China and, of course, with our European partners and counterparts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The call was focused, as the readout conveyed &#8212; the vast majority of it was on Russia&#8217;s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine.&nbsp; But also, the issue of Taiwan was raised by the Chinese, and the President reiterated the U.S. policy on Taiwan has not changed.&nbsp; That was really the vast majority of the focus of the call.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Obviously, there are a range of issues and topics we discussed with the Chinese.&nbsp; And as a part of this call, there was an agreement on ensuring there was an open line of communication and that the discussion would continue in this critical period ahead, of course at lower levels.</p>



<p>Go ahead.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During this two-hour call, did President Xi ever refer to it as an “invasion”?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We&#8217;ll let President Xi and his team outline any more specifics about his component of the conversation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why not reveal if he called it an invasion or called it a war, given he&#8217;s not (inaudible)?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Because we don&#8217;t, as a policy, speak for other countries.&nbsp; They can speak for themselves.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yesterday, Secretary Blinken said the administration was concerned that China is considering answering Russia&#8217;s requests for more military equipment.&nbsp; After this two-hour call, does the White House still have that concern?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We have that concern.&nbsp; The President detailed, you know, what the implications and consequences would be if China provides material support to Russia as it conducts brutal attacks against Ukrainian cities and civilians.&nbsp; And obviously, that is something we will be watching and the world will be watching.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, that concern hasn&#8217;t gone away following the call?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Obviously, actions are a key part of what we&#8217;ll be watching.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov says that Russia will view any weapons shipments into Ukraine as, quote, “legitimate targets.”&nbsp; Obviously, President Biden just authorized $800 million in more security assistance &#8212; aka weapons, potentially &#8212; going into Ukraine.&nbsp; So, what is the President&#8217;s response to that comment?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, that&#8217;s a threat that he has made before, I would just note &#8212; Foreign Minister Lavrov.&nbsp; I would note that &#8212; just in terms of how it works, without getting into too many logistics &#8212; of course, there are no U.S. troops operating inside Ukraine.&nbsp; Our forces are in NATO territory, and so are NATO forces in NATO territory.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, as we&#8217;re talking about the operations of the movement of convoys and the movement of assistance, that &#8212; those are not the bodies that would be moving those assistance within Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, beyond that, though, I would say, of course, we &#8212; we watch closely what the actions are &#8212; the continued escalatory actions of &#8212; of the Russians.&nbsp; And &#8212; and we will watch closely if they follow up on that threat.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I would remind you all that all of the convoys are not just moving military assistance; many of them are moving humanitarian assistance as well &#8212; food, you know, and other aid that is getting to people who have been injured through this brutal invasion.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I guess the question is: How concerned are you about being able to get all $800 million of that assistance that’s obviously so critically needed into Ukraine?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, we continue to have the means of getting that assistance in.&nbsp; And we have effectively been doing that in recent days, so we will continue to work through those channels.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.&nbsp; Did President Biden directly ask President Xi if he intends to help Russia?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;Well, he made clear what the implications and the consequences would be if China provides material support to Russia as it conducts brutal attacks against Ukrainian cities and civilians.&nbsp; And that made clear what the consequences would be should they do that.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But did he ask, “Do you intend to help Russia &#8212; yes or no?”</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I think making clear what the consequences are made clear we don&#8217;t want them to do it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So can you offer any explanation for why the U.S. still has concerns after this call?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Because we&#8217;ll &#8212; we&#8217;ll continue to watch until we see what actions they take or don&#8217;t take.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; And following up on Andrea&#8217;s question, does the administration view any distinction between financial support and military support for Russia?&nbsp; Or will the consequences &#8212; will there be consequences regardless of what kind of aid?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We would watch closely, and there &#8212; we would be prepared for there to be consequences, but we would look closely on what it is and we would align with our partners around the world.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And is it going to be escalatory consequences, like we&#8217;ve seen with Russia?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Again, I&#8217;m not going to get into a hypothetical at this point in time.&nbsp; We&#8217;ll have those discussions directly with the Chinese and directly with our European partners.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And one more.&nbsp; Short of getting any guarantees from China that they are not going to help Russia, and short of China condemning Russia for its actions, what is it about the call that President Biden thinks “went well,” as he said to one of my colleagues?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I think it was an opportunity for the President to convey directly what our detailed efforts have been, what we have seen on the ground, how we have responded to the invasion, why we have the significant level of concern that we have, and also to convey very directly, leader to leader, what the implications and consequences would be if Russia provides material support.</p>



<p>And that leader-to-leader engagement and opportunity for there to be a continuing discussion, certainly the President sees as a positive &#8212; as a positive development.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.&nbsp; A couple of days ago, you described Javelins and Stingers as “defensive weapons” and MiGs and planes as “offensive weapons.”&nbsp; So how do we classify the armed drones that we&#8217;re sending?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Any &#8212; I would remind everybody that Russia is invading Ukraine, not the other way around.&nbsp; Ukraine is not invading Russia; they are not going into a foreign country and invading that country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And what we&#8217;re sending to Ukraine is security assistance, all of it, and weapons that they are effectively using to defend their country against Russian aggression.&nbsp; And that is how all of this material would be categorized.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In that sense, then, wouldn&#8217;t MiGs also be defensive since Ukraine is defending itself from attacks from Russia?</p>



<p><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, again, this is all assessments made by our Defense Department, but I would tell you that as it relates to the transfer of fighter planes from a U.S. base in Germany into contested Ukrainian airspace where our military and intelligence community determine the benefits provided to Ukraine&#8217;s defense are low and the risks of escalation are high, that is how we assess that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But also, those type of planes would be a different category of military assistance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It seems like we&#8217;re splitting hairs over semantics in terms of how we&#8217;re classifying some of these weapon systems.&nbsp; And obviously, the President has gotten some criticism from both sides of the aisle for, even when he takes action, sometimes doing it after there&#8217;s been a lot of political pressure &#8212; for instance, on imposing the sanctions, on sending the Stingers and the Javelins, on banning Russian oil.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So if there&#8217;s any chance that the U.S. is going to facilitate the transfer of MiGs in some way, why not just do it now?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I think we&#8217;ve outlined pretty clearly why we&#8217;ve made the decision not to do that, including the fact that they have multiple squadrons of planes that they can utilize and the fact that, most importantly, the types of assistance that we&#8217;ve been providing &#8212; anti-armor, anti-tank, anti-missiles &#8212; is what is effective in fighting this war on the ground.&nbsp; That is why we&#8217;ve provided that assistance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>None of the weapons we&#8217;ve sent to Ukraine could be used to launch an invasion of another &#8212; of a country like Russia.&nbsp; That&#8217;s a fact.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why we call them defensive weapons.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why the Defense Department calls them defensive weapons.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I would remind everybody that they are the country that are under attack.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to move on to the Iran talks.&nbsp; This week, the President said that “we are crippling Putin&#8217;s economy with punishing sanctions [that are] only going to grow more painful over time…”&nbsp; But the State Department said that the administration would not sanction Russian participation in nuclear projects that are part of the JCPOA.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So how does the administration justify calling for such strong sanctions on Russia but giving them a pass when it comes to Iran?&nbsp; Isn&#8217;t that hypocritical in some sense?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; There&#8217;s absolutely no pass given.&nbsp; They&#8217;re not getting additional assistance or sanctions relief of any sort.&nbsp; They have an implementation role &#8212; they&#8217;ve had an implementation role in the past as it relates to the Iran nuclear deal, and that is certainly what we would be talking about in this regard.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But for clarity purposes, there&#8217;s absolutely no &#8212; no additional sanctions assistance that Russia would be receiving that is outside of the Iran nuclear deal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So &#8212; but just carving out what&#8217;s already there and giving it protection that it &#8212; that it will not be sanctioned?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, to explain to you or for those of you who have covered: Back in 2015 &#8212; you may remember this &#8212; that there was &#8212; there have been roles in the past that Russia has played in terms of the movement or the protection &#8212; the nuclear protections, in some capacity, of &#8212; as we&#8217;re implementing the Iran deal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re really referring to.&nbsp; That&#8217;s part of the discussion and the deal.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a new deal that we&#8217;re doing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; It&#8217;s the similar implementation components.&nbsp; It&#8217;s implementation and discussion around a similar deal that was discussed back in 2015.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, the Director of National Intelligence Annual Threat Assessment last month said that Iran has threatened to kill former and current U.S. officials in retaliation for the U.S. killing the IRGC&#8217;s leader, Qasem Soleimani.&nbsp; So, do those threats constitute terrorism?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would just remind you all that where we are &#8212; one, I&#8217;m not going to confirm or get into specifics about any threats through intelligence channels.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But what &#8212; where we are right now &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It’s a public report, though.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, where we are right now is that not only has Iran&#8217;s nuclear program advanced, but their behavior in the region and beyond has gotten more aggressive, including by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, the notion that the actions of the past administration pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal has &#8212; has cut down on the actions or the escalatory behavior of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard is inaccurate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They&#8217;ve actually &#8212; the Iranian government has actually doubled their budget or something like that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, the notion that the approach &#8212; that the status quo is effective and making us safer just doesn&#8217;t bear out in any form of facts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, they should not, then &#8212; the IRGC &#8212; be delisted from the terrorist blacklist?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; There&#8217;s an ongoing negotiation.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not going to get into specifics of it.&nbsp; But I would just note that the status quo where we stand has done nothing to make us safer in any regard.&nbsp; In fact, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard has only been strengthened.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, I want to follow up with you on the call.&nbsp; You have, from the podium and in the readout &#8212; it says the President described the implications and consequences if China provides material support to Russia.</p>



<p>So, to be clear, did President Biden warn President Xi not to send any support to Russia?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I think he made clear what the implications and consequences would be if he did.&nbsp; That is laying out what the consequences would be.&nbsp; President Xi has to decide what he&#8217;s going to do here.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And not to split hairs, but is it fair to characterize that as a “warning”?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I would characterize it exactly as I said it.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And did President Biden and President Xi discuss the possibility of lifting sanctions and/or tariffs as a way to get China (inaudible)?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; This was not about carrots.&nbsp; This was about laying out what the implications and consequences would be.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did the President step away from the phone call and have a sense that he can work with China as it relates to Ukraine?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I think he came away feeling that he had conveyed clearly what the implications and consequences would be, and also that he had the opportunity to lay out specifically what steps we&#8217;ve taken, why, and what we&#8217;re seeing on the ground.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And he also said that we would continue conversations at &#8212; task the teams to continue conversations.&nbsp; So that indicates that we will continue to engage with them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to follow up with you on something we&#8217;ve been discussing throughout the week: the issue of refugees.&nbsp; Newsweek has reported that the U.S. is actually detaining Ukrainian refugees in the ICE detention centers &#8212; those who are seeking entry into the country &#8212; which seems like a contradiction of President Biden saying that he would welcome them here.&nbsp; Can you tell us why this is happening and what&#8217;s being done?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I can&#8217;t confirm any specific cases.&nbsp; I&#8217;d point you to the Department of Homeland Security.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But what I would say is that we are still implementing our immigration laws at the border.&nbsp; That means that Title 42 is in place.&nbsp; And for individuals who come through, you know, abnormal migration, we approach that through the same laws and implementation.&nbsp; When the President says he would welcome refugees, of course he would, but they have to apply through the refugee programs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Understood.&nbsp; But do you acknowledge, Jen, that detaining them is a contradiction to President Biden saying he would welcome them with open arms?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, again, Kristen, we implement and we &#8212; our immigration laws across the board, no matter what country you come from.&nbsp; And that has been our case and approach from the beginning.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Welcoming refugees means applying through the refugee process.&nbsp; And again, as I&#8217;ve said in here, we&#8217;re looking at a range of options, including providing a broad range of humanitarian assistance to the countries where the vast majority of refugees are going.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it a priority for President Biden to address this situation so that refugees are not being detained at ICE detention centers?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, again, we are continuing to apply our immigration laws at the border.&nbsp; And so, refugees who want to come to the United States &#8212; of course we would welcome Ukrainian refugees.&nbsp; That is why &#8212; but they have to apply through the existing programs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There&#8217;s an ongoing discussion about what programs or what steps we could take.&nbsp; And we certainly &#8212; that&#8217;s an important conversation and process internally.</p>



<p>Where we have put all of our efforts to date &#8212; the vast majority of them to date has been on providing a historic amount of funding to countries in the region, including a huge amount &#8212; billions of dollars &#8212; that has been approved through the omnibus bill the President just signed into law to make sure that the countries that are welcoming the vast majority of these refugees have assistance and support and aid that they need.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, you mentioned Taiwan.&nbsp; Will the U.S. deliver Javelins and Stingers on time this year to Taiwan?&nbsp; Can you answer that?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have any update for you on military assistance to Taiwan.&nbsp; I would point you to the Department of Defense.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And a separate question, real quick.&nbsp; The White House &#8212; is it aware of ongoing destruction and vandalism of Catholic churches across the United States, statues as well?&nbsp; Is the President aware of that destruction taking place right now across the U.S.?&nbsp;</p>



<p>The most recent example is in Florida, at the Holy Family Catholic Church; in Royal Oak, Michigan, St. Mary Catholic Church; in Georgia, Sacred Heart Catholic Church.&nbsp; All vandalized, destroyed.&nbsp; (Inaudible.)</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We can assure you that the President, the White House, and the United States would oppose any destruction or desecration of religious institutions of any kind.&nbsp; And certainly, Catholic churches &#8212; the President himself is a Catholic, of course.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And finally, does the President believe that perhaps Pope Francis could play a role in mediating an end to this Ukraine crisis &#8212; the war?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I just don&#8217;t have anything on Pope Francis&#8217;s role.&nbsp; Obviously, we&#8217;re focusing our efforts at this point in time in engaging with our European allies and counterparts around the world.</p>



<p>Go ahead, Ashley.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, thanks.&nbsp; If President Biden does not make a second stop on his trip abroad next week, as has been rumored, to Poland or to some other place, what would be the reason?&nbsp; Would it be security concerns?&nbsp; Would it not be wanting to visit refugees at the border to draw resources away from that crisis?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I expect we&#8217;ll have more on the trip soon, so I don&#8217;t want to get too ahead of where we may or may not be.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But we factor in a range of factors whenever we make any travel plans, including pulling resources away, as you noted; including security concerns; including, you know, ensuring that we can implement it effectively.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But we pulled this trip together pretty quickly, so we&#8217;re working as quickly as we can to get any other details finalized.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And one more on a different topic.&nbsp; Following up on what my colleague asked yesterday, President Zelenskyy mentioned in his address this idea of a “U24. United for Peace.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>What &#8212; it&#8217;s a little unclear, to me at least, what exactly that would look like.&nbsp; I mean, what is the White House&#8217;s understanding of what he&#8217;s asking for?&nbsp; Is that an alternative to NATO?&nbsp; What role would it fill?&nbsp; Can you try to fill in some of those gaps?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We just don&#8217;t have any other assessment or explanation from here.&nbsp; I mean, I&#8217;d certainly point you to the Ukrainians to discuss in more detail.&nbsp; We talk with them regularly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But have they not conveyed any of that to you?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t &#8212; I would let them speak for their own proposals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, did &#8212; when the President spoke to President Xi, did he set out any particular benchmarks by which he would measure their compliance, either financially, on the arms issue?&nbsp; Any timeframes out there?&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other words, did he lay &#8212; did he come to some kind of understanding or declaration to President Xi about how he would be measuring success?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Success in terms of whether or not he provides material support?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That&#8217;s right.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have anything more to outline on that for you.&nbsp; I would just say that the call was not about making asks.&nbsp; It wasn&#8217;t about making assessments.&nbsp; It was about having an ongoing discussion and dialogue about the illegal invasion &#8212; the invasion of &#8212; of Russia&#8217;s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And was there any discussion of the agreement that President Xi reached with President Putin, just at the opening of the Olympics?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I just don&#8217;t have more details on the call to read out beyond what we&#8217;ve conveyed to date.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah, what can you say about the severity of the implications and consequences for Rus- &#8212; for China if they do, indeed, in the estimation of the U.S., provide material support to Russia?&nbsp; I mean, are these to the level where it should really make China think twice before assisting Russia?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, it&#8217;s up to President Xi and the Chinese to make that decision.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the President, again, laid out very clearly and directly in the call what the implications and consequences would be if they provided material support.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why is the White House choosing not to elaborate and disclose more about what the consequences could be here?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Because we feel that it would be most constructive to have those conversations directly with the Chinese.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi.&nbsp; A senior administration official just told us that the Pres- &#8212; that President Biden didn&#8217;t make any specific requests to Xi and that China will make its own decisions.&nbsp; But we&#8217;re hearing that &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I think I just said that too.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Laughs.)</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; There you go.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But we&#8217;re nearing a pretty critical point in the war where, according to your own assessment, Russia seems poised to potentially deploy bio or chemical weapons.&nbsp; How much time is there for China to really weigh in here with Putin?&nbsp; And why not press for that while on the call?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I think that the primary focus of this call was for the President to lay out specifically the consequences and specifically where we&#8217;ve come to date.&nbsp; His assessment was that was the most constructive way to spend the call and that it&#8217;s going to be up to President Xi and the Chinese to determine what role they&#8217;re going to play moving forward.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Implications and consequences.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#8217;m asking about this again because &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; in the leadup to Russia&#8217;s invasion, the White House was really extremely transparent, laying out in call after call and briefing after briefing a lot of the specifics that we then saw implemented.</p>



<p>Why, in this case, is it just saying “implications and consequences” and not giving those same specifics?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; Because we feel it&#8217;s the most constructive way to engage and have a constructive dialogue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But just to &#8212; just to clarify: The specifics were given out in detail on this call, it sounds like what you&#8217;re saying?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Correct.&nbsp; Every &#8212; every &#8212; well, again, I&#8217;m not going to give you more details about the level of detail, but it was a detailed engagement.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not going to outline that more from here.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But it was &#8212; he was &#8212; again, he was specific about what he described on the call.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, Jen.&nbsp; I hope I&#8217;m not beating a dead horse here.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; It&#8217;s okay.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah, okay.&nbsp; It&#8217;s Friday.</p>



<p>So, you said recently the point of this call would be to see where Xi stands.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yep.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You&#8217;re obviously reluctant to tell us where Xi stands, based on that call.&nbsp; And you point to the Chinese, but their readout, if you&#8217;ve read it, is &#8212; yeah &#8212; doesn&#8217;t tell you much either.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, can you at least say, after a two-hour call: Is the White House confident and knows where Xi stands and you just don&#8217;t want to tell us?&nbsp; Or are you not telling us because you don&#8217;t really understand where he stands?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I think what I can tell you is that they tasked the teams with having continued discussions, but I&#8217;m not going to provide you any additional assessment from here.</p>



<p>Go ahead, in the middle.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How does President Biden define the current Chinese and U.S. relationship right now?&nbsp; Have you scheduled more communications, meetings, calls?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah, they tasked the teams to follow up on today&#8217;s conversation and on &#8212; in this critical period ahead.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have anything in terms of when that will take place, but that was part of it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, following the recent Texas primary election, the AP is reporting that roughly 13 percent of ballots were discarded following, you know, new state-wide election laws.&nbsp; One, is the White House concerned about these new numbers?&nbsp; And has the White House put in any new plan to try and get some sort of federal voting rights legislation or executive order enact &#8212; put into implementation?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, certainly we will continue to stay &#8212; we remain committed &#8212; the President and the Vice President remain committed to doing everything we can to get voting rights legislation passed and move forward.&nbsp; And these reports are certainly a reminder of how important that is.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In terms of the specifics of it, I&#8217;d really point you to the Democratic Party Committee on the political side of this, and I will see if our team has any other specific reaction from here.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have one other question.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We know next week the Supreme Court nominee Jus- &#8212; or Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson will be going forward with hearings.&nbsp; There are some new accusations from Capitol Hill, some Republicans still saying that she&#8217;s soft on crime.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Senator Josh Hawley, for instance, saying that she is soft, particularly, on sex offenders.&nbsp; What is the White House&#8217;s response to these new accusations?&nbsp; And are you at all concerned that it might taint public view as we go into hearings next week.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I think, as we broadly look at it, I mean, after weeks of trying hard to find some way to attack Judge Jackson &#8212; first saying that she was an affirmative action pick, then saying she was the product of dark money, then saying she should be &#8212; she should be suspect because she was a public defender &#8212; a group of far-right Republican senators, as you noted, have launched a last-ditch, eve-of-hearing desperation attack on her record on sentencing in sexual offense cases.</p>



<p>What is important here, I think, are the facts.&nbsp; And the facts are that in the vast majority of cases involving child sex crimes broadly, the sentences Judge Jackson imposed were consistent with or above what the government or U.S. probation recommended.&nbsp;<br><br>And so this attack that we&#8217;ve seen over the last couple of days relies on factual inaccuracies and taking Judge Jackson&#8217;s record wildly out of context.&nbsp; It dishonestly took a snippet of a transcript out of context, when in fact, Judge Jackson was repeating something a witness said in order to ask a question about their testimony.&nbsp; It also admits that &#8212; omits that the Sentencing Commission Report mentioned was unanimously approved by the Commission and is by law &#8212; which is, by law, bipartisan with equal representation.</p>



<p>So we&#8217;re going to continue from here to reiterate what the actual facts are, and we hope that those who are taking this process seriously &#8212; or state that they are taking this process seriously &#8212; will also look to the facts and not disingenuous attacks.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; Two questions about COVID.&nbsp; You talked earlier, to Zeke&#8217;s question, about the additional funding being needed to ensure that the fourth-dose boosters would be widely available.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secretary Becerra said today that, hopefully, soon the government will be telling parents of kids under five that they can get their kids vaccinated.&nbsp; And he said that will also put strain on the system.&nbsp; Is there any chance that the vaccine doses for the kids under five wouldn&#8217;t be available if this COVID money doesn&#8217;t come through?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; It&#8217;s not about available; I think it&#8217;s about making them free.&nbsp; So &#8212; because, obviously, these companies are going to produce doses.&nbsp; If it&#8217;s &#8212; if and when, at some point &#8212; as a &#8212; as a mother of a child under five, God willing, soon &#8212; making them available.</p>



<p>But what we want to be able to do is continue to make them free.&nbsp; So that is where our focus and our concern is.&nbsp; And obviously, beyond that, for people who are uninsured, for people who don&#8217;t have the resources to cover the cost of a fourth dose or a vaccine for their kid or otherwise, this is pretty important that we move this funding forward so that we can continue to provide these type of programs across the country.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But if there isn&#8217;t additional funding, would this be the first age group that would not get free shots potentially?&nbsp; Like are you counting on that money to make sure that those doses are free?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I&#8217;d have to check with our COVID team on it.&nbsp; Obviously, they look &#8212; since it hasn&#8217;t been approved yet, what we&#8217;ve been able to do is outline for you what programs would have to be ended or halted and the timeline of them.&nbsp; But I can check with them and see if there&#8217;s any specific planning for this.</p>



<p>But obviously, if we don&#8217;t have funding, it&#8217;s hard to make vaccines for anyone free.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; There was a report earlier today that Iran secretly set up banking and finance system to get around the U.S.-led sanctions.&nbsp; I&#8217;m wondering if the U.S. has a response to that, and if you think it might complicate the negotiations?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I&#8217;d have to check with our team on that.&nbsp; I don’t have confirmation of the accuracy of that, so let me check with our team and see if we have concerns and what our response would be.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, earlier this week, you were asked whether Jake Sullivan, in his conversation with his Russian counterpart, brought up the hostages at Chernobyl.&nbsp; You said you&#8217;d check.&nbsp; I&#8217;m just wondering if you had any updated info on that?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: I did mean to get back to you on that.&nbsp; I apologize.&nbsp; So, let me venture to do that this afternoon.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; Two questions.&nbsp; First, on the call, there&#8217;s been, in recent days, concerns voiced by U.S. officials about China amplifying Russian disinformation about the situation there.&nbsp; Did come up on the call?&nbsp; What was said?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I just don’t have more details.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve obviously been very vocal about our concern on that front, but I don&#8217;t have more details about whether that was part of the discussion.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And secondly, an update on &#8212; earlier this week, the Second Gentleman tested positive for COVID.&nbsp; Can you give us an update on the Vice President?&nbsp; Has she tested again since?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; She did, and she tested negative again today.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Go ahead, Patsy.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; You mentioned that on the call the President focused on Ukraine, the Chinese side raised the issue of Taiwan.&nbsp; Obviously, you&#8217;re not giving us any specifics on sanctions, export controls, and such, but was there a discussion about broader trade relations between the U.S. and China?</p>



<p>And then I&#8217;ll have a follow-up question specific about American investments in Chinese tech firms after that.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, the vast &#8212; the vast, vast majority of the call was about those two topics.&nbsp; So, beyond that, I don&#8217;t have more to read out for you, but that was really the focus of the call.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; And so, a couple of administration officials have been advocating that the President issues an executive order that ban &#8212; that would ban American investments in Chinese tech firms.&nbsp; What is the status of that?&nbsp; What is causing the delay?&nbsp; Does it have anything to do with the TikTok-Oracle deal?&nbsp; Is there an anticipated timeline?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have any update or preview of what that looks like at this point in time.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Can I ask one more thing on the &#8212; on the global pandemic response?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the House of Representatives slashing the $5 billion that you&#8217;ve asked from the omnibus bill, do you have a plan B in trying to meet the goal of delivering what the rest of the 700 million, now, out of the 1.2 billion doses that you have pledged?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I can certainly check on how many of those have already been purchased, which I think would be a helpful piece of information.</p>



<p>But there is not a secret fund that we have not told you about to continue to provide the type of free programs we have in the United States, or to provide the level of international assistance that we would like to continue to provide.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But let me check and see, of those doses we&#8217;ve committed, if there is a set number that have already been purchased.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, so, basically, if there is no more money, then there will be no more doses other than the ones that&#8217;s already been purchased because there might not even be any money for the delivery of those doses that have already been purchased, right?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We need &#8212; we need additional funding to continue to be the arsenal of vaccines in the world.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; I wanted to go back to the Supreme Court nomination hearings for next week.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you talk &#8212; in the President&#8217;s schedule, you didn’t mention that.&nbsp; And obviously, he&#8217;s not testifying in the nomination hearing.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Not that we&#8217;re tracking.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; But, yes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you talk about how this White House is preparing, how Judge Jackson is preparing for next week; how the President will be involved &#8212; given he&#8217;s got a lot going on next week as well?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would say that Judge Jackson, as you know, has a whole team of people internally and externally who has been helping her through the preparation process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And she &#8212; which won&#8217;t surprise anyone &#8212; started studying and practicing and preparing as soon as she was nominated to serve on the Supreme Court, and that process has obviously picked up over the last couple of days.&nbsp; And so our team will be closely watching and monitoring the hearings next week.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll be responding to the inevitable doses of misinformation that travel out as well.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also wanted to ask about COVID testing.&nbsp; The administration announced that families could order a second round of rapid tests a few weeks &#8212; a few weeks ago? &#8212; I don’t know when it was, but recently.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yes, in the State of the Union.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, thank you.&nbsp; Could you provide an update on how many tests you&#8217;ve shipped at this point and whether there&#8217;s been interest in that second round?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I can certainly check and see if we have an updated number.&nbsp; I know there has been interest, but we&#8217;ll see if there is an updated number to provide.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Brian, go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.&nbsp; I wanted to ask about the rapport between Xi and President Biden.&nbsp; The two men have shared a meal together.&nbsp; They&#8217;ve known each other for more than 10 years.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is an important moment in U.S.-Chinese relations.&nbsp; How did their personal rapport play into today&#8217;s call?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would say they know each other.&nbsp; As you&#8217;ve noted, they&#8217;ve spent time together, they&#8217;ve had a range of direct and candid conversations.&nbsp; This is not the first.&nbsp; And that certainly contributes to the President&#8217;s ability to be as direct as he is, whether it is laying out how &#8212; where we&#8217;ve come from and why we are at this point, and his great concerns and significant concerns about Russia&#8217;s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, and also what the implications and consequences would be.</p>



<p>So, there&#8217;s no question that the President&#8217;s time on the world stage, his prior relationship with President Xi, having spent time with him, engaged with him directly, had many multi-hour calls and meetings with him contributes to his ability to have those type of conversations.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did the President bring up those past meetings in this two-hour call today?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don’t think there is a reason to bring them up.&nbsp; They both know that they&#8217;ve had past meetings, so, you know, I think it just starts the meeting from an understanding of where the other is coming from.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah, in the first event with the President today, why didn’t the President chose to address the phone call personally between he and President Xi?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Because it was about a different topic, and there&#8217;s a lot of things the American people care deeply about, so it was his effort to communicate about a range of thi- &#8212; a range of issues.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But when you have the leader of the largest economy in the world and the second-largest economy in the world, and they&#8217;re talking, they call could fall on either side of an invasion, you know, the American people might want to hear directly from the President.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, we&#8217;ve provided a range of updates, briefings, readouts, and hopefully you all will be effective, as I&#8217;m sure you will, in communicating that to the American people.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And one more thing &#8212; on the call, did the President push China about business &#8212; the Chinese companies doing business in Russia?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would say first that, you know, the President, as we all have made clear that there have been implications, as you see, while we have not asked companies to take specific steps, you look at Russia and what&#8217;s happened there and what the implications have been for the Russian economy of companies pulling out.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I know that&#8217;s certainly something for every country to watch as they&#8217;re making decisions about which side of this conflict they&#8217;re going to stand on.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; Poland is calling for an international peacekeeping mission in the Ukraine.&nbsp; Is that something the U.S. would entertain or support and possibly participate in?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I&#8217;d have to get more details on what that looks like.&nbsp; I&#8217;m happy to talk with our national security team about that.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then I have, like, a fun Friday question.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; (Laughs.)</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The House passed the CROWN Act, which bans</p>



<p>discrimination based on hairstyle.&nbsp; Is this something the administration supports?&nbsp; Would they sign it into law if the Senate passed it?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;I have seen that.&nbsp; I have not talked to our legislative team about it.&nbsp; I&#8217;m happy to do that.&nbsp; And we&#8217;ll see if we can get you a fun Fru- &#8212; fun Friday answer back.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; In response to the mistreatment of African immigrants fleeing Ukraine, the White House did put out a statement a couple of weeks ago saying that they received assurances from the U.N. and Ukrainian authorities in government that they&#8217;re committed to the fair and equal treatment of those seeking departure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But doubling down, what are those assurances?&nbsp; Because we&#8217;re still hearing a lot of stories of incidents that are happening with those who are trying to flee.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I think it is &#8212; it is something we continue to watch closely.&nbsp; And we have seen reports of &#8212; that &#8212; you know, that we would be &#8212; we are concerned about.&nbsp; So we would just raise those concerns we have directly, and we felt it was important to put out a public statement at that time to follow up on.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And just a couple more questions.&nbsp; One, how soon can we expect the President to sign the anti-lynching bill?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I can check and see what the timing &#8212; I know we were waiting for the Vice President, I think, to get back from travel.&nbsp; But, yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, lastly, about a quarter of Americans are not vaccinated or are partially vaccinated.&nbsp; Numbers aren&#8217;t really budging.&nbsp; Is there any move or change to the definition of what is “fully vaccinated”?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; That would be for the CDC to determine.&nbsp; There hasn&#8217;t been a change at this point in time.&nbsp; It still remains two doses, but we are continuing to encourage any American who has not received a booster to do exactly that because it would provide them additional necessary protection.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Judge Jackson&#8217;s hearings next week, has some of that prep work included conversations between the nominee and the President and any advice from the former chairman of the Judiciary Committee?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I&#8217;m not going to get into details about their private conversations.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So is he &#8212; so he has not played a role in sort of the prep or the &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; He’s not participating in the mock preps, no.&nbsp; But he is certainly excited about her hearings next week and being confirmed to serve on the bench.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve got a quick clarification and two questions about presidential conflicts of interest in foreign affairs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The first brief clarification is: The New York Times reported this week that the First Son remains under criminal investigation.&nbsp; Does the President still intend to stay out of that case?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; It&#8217;s the Department of Justice, and I would point you to them.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And my two questions about conflicts of interest in foreign affairs.&nbsp; First, I have a question about Russia and then one about China.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On Russia: You told me last year that you were unfamiliar with the Senate report that alleged that the First Son &#8212; or a company linked to the First Son received $3.5 million from the richest woman in Russia.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Subsequent reporting indicates that President Biden, when he was Vice President, had a dinner in Georgetown with the same woman in 2015.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This &#8212; Yelena Baturina, she has not been sanctioned yet by the U.S. government.&nbsp; How is President Biden navigating conflicts of interest when it comes to sanctioning people who have done business with his family?&nbsp; And can you explain to us what this $3.5 million was for?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have any confirmation of the accuracy of that report, so I have no more further details.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you say anything about the conflicts of interest, though &#8212; how he&#8217;s navigating those when deciding sanctions?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; What would be his conflicts of interest?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, his son’s company allegedly got $3.5 million from &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; He &#8212; which I have no confirmation of.&nbsp; And he has continued to sanction oligarchs more than we&#8217;ve ever sanctioned in the past.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not sure that&#8217;s a conflict of interest, though.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But she hasn&#8217;t been sanctioned, though.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She hasn’t been sanctioned, though.&nbsp; She has &#8212;&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a question about Russia now.&nbsp; My &#8211;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I think we’re moving on because we got to get to more people.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#8217;m sorry.&nbsp; I&#8217;m sorry.&nbsp; We could &#8212; hold on.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My question about the conflict of interests when it comes to China is: Last year, the First Son’s attorney said that he divested from a Chinese investment fund controlled by Chinese state-owned entities.&nbsp; We have received not even basic transparency about who bought out his stake, when this happened, and how much money changed hands.&nbsp; Did he actually divest?&nbsp; And if so, can you agree to basic transparency?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; He’s a private citizen.&nbsp; He doesn&#8217;t work for the government.&nbsp; I&#8217;d point you to his representatives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thank you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But there&#8217;s a blaring conflict of interest for his father’s role as President, dealing with China.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I think we’re done here.&nbsp; Thank you very much.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.&nbsp; Did President Biden talk to President Xi Jinping about the escalating tensions on the Korean Peninsula?&nbsp; How did the President Xi respond to this?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Again, the vast, vast majority of the call was about Russia&#8217;s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine.&nbsp; And again, when the Chinese &#8212; when President Xi raised Taiwan, the President reiterated the U.S. policy on Taiwan.&nbsp; Obviously, there are a lot of important issues that we discussed with the Chinese &#8212; some where we work together, some where we have strong concern.&nbsp; And there&#8217;s a lot of channels for that.&nbsp; But that was the primary focus of the conversation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks so much.&nbsp; This is Jahanzaib Ali from ARY News TV Pakistan.&nbsp; Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan requested for a telephone conversation with President Biden like many, many months ago &#8212; it&#8217;s like more than 14 or 15 months.&nbsp; We haven&#8217;t heard anything about that.&nbsp; Is there a specific reason for not communicating with the Pakistani leadership?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have any update on a planned call or engagement.&nbsp; Obviously, we engage with Pakistan and a range of leaders at a number of levels through the State Department, through our national security team.&nbsp; But in terms of a call or engagement with the President, I don’t have anything to predict on that front.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After his recent visit to Russia, Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan told a public gathering that he will not be a slave of America like other politicians do.&nbsp; Would you like to comment on that?&nbsp; (Inaudible.)</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We have a long relationship with Pakistan, and that is a relationship we’ll continue through diplomatic channels.&nbsp; So I don&#8217;t have any more comments on that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Oh, we can go to both of you.&nbsp; Go ahead.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go &#8212; I don&#8217;t know whoever wants to go.&nbsp; You can rock, paper, scissors.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; You might have seen that President Putin held a rally at which he said, of the Russian people, that “we have not had unity like this for a long time.”&nbsp; Is that your perception?&nbsp; Do you have any comment?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, we&#8217;re not going to respond to Putin’s &#8212; President Putin&#8217;s misinformation and propaganda rally, which is how we see it.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And secondly, just a bigger-picture question: There&#8217;s been a lot of discussion this week about war crimes and war criminals.&nbsp; You&#8217;re well aware the United States does not recognize the International Criminal Court.&nbsp; Does &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We’re not a member, yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah, not a member.&nbsp; President Biden believes that is the correct stance?&nbsp; And if so, doesn’t that undercut the United States’ moral authority on this?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would note that there are a range of international bodies that have ongoing international investigations.&nbsp; We would not be the ones prosecuting, of course.&nbsp; There&#8217;d be international bodies prosecuting any case on war crimes.&nbsp; We&#8217;re going to feed data and information into that, and they support their process.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; The Western Balkans, please.&nbsp; Russia and China spreading their influence a lot in the Western Balkans, especially Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Kosovo.&nbsp; And President is a friend of the Bosnians and the Kosovans.&nbsp; Can you assure people over there that America is still with them?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Absolutely.&nbsp; Please &#8212; please send that directly.</p>



<p>Go ahead, Nazira.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah, thank you very much, Jen.&nbsp; As you know, we celebrate our Nowruz New Year.&nbsp; Afghan people (inaudible).&nbsp; Do you have any message?&nbsp;</p>



<p>And also, yesterday, President Biden signed some document &#8212; PTS &#8212; for the new arrival Afghan refugees to &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Oh, TPS.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TPS.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Yes, yes.&nbsp; We did.&nbsp; So, the President did sign TPS for Afghans, which means that those who have been in the country &#8212; and let me get to the exact information on that.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s see.&nbsp; So &#8212; let&#8217;s see.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Okay.&nbsp; So, basically &#8212; okay, so the TPS will apply only to those individuals who are already residing in the United States as of March 15, 2022, and meet all of the requirements, including undergoing security and background checks.&nbsp; And this is a designation decided by the Department of Homeland Security through their process.&nbsp; And their designated Afghanistan &#8212; they designated Afghanistan for TPS on the statutory basis of ongoing armed conflict and extraordinary and temporary conditions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>U.S. Citizens &#8212; Citizenship and Immigration Services estimates that approximately 74,500 individuals in the United States would become eligible for TPS through the designation for Afghanistan, and that includes 72,500 who have been paroled into the United States through Operation Allies Welcome and approximately 2,000 Afghan nationals who did not participate in the Operation Allies Welcome and were otherwise in the United States already.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So this is a new designation just announced this week.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How about the New Years &#8212; Nowruz?&nbsp; Any message for Afghan people, especially Afghan women?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would say we would send a message of Happy New Year&#8217;s to the Afghan people and certainly a special shout-out to Afghan women.&nbsp; And we have huge admiration for their courage, their bravery, and we will continue to stand with them during these challenging times.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thank you, everyone.&nbsp; Happy Friday.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Via Teleconference</p>



<p>2:53 P.M. EDT</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Thanks, everyone, for joining.&nbsp; I just &#8212; at the top, I want to say, you know, incredibly sorry for the delay today.&nbsp; We really try for this not to ever happen.&nbsp; And just some scheduling and logistical challenges today put us a little bit back.&nbsp; So, again, true apologies, and we know how important your time is.</p>



<p>So, that being said, you know, welcome to the call.&nbsp; This call is on background.&nbsp; It is attributable to a &#8220;senior administration official.&#8221;&nbsp; And this call is embargoed until the end of the call.</p>



<p>For your awareness and not for reporting, the speaker on this call is [senior administration official].&nbsp; And with that, I&#8217;ll turn it over to you to give some remarks, and then we&#8217;ll take some questions.&nbsp; Thanks, again, everyone.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Thanks, [senior administration official].&nbsp; And I&#8217;ll just reiterate: Everybody, thanks for your patience today.&nbsp; And I&#8217;ll, with that, just get right to it.</p>



<p>You all have hopefully now seen the readout that has gone out.&nbsp; So, just building on that with a little bit more detail for all of you, you know, the call between President Biden and President Xi this morning lasted approximately two hours.&nbsp; Of course, it was conducted by a secure video link.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I would say the conversation was direct.&nbsp; It was substantive and it was detailed.&nbsp; The two leaders spent the preponderance of their time discussing Russia&#8217;s unprovoked and unjustified invasion of Ukraine, as well as the implications of the crisis for U.S.-China relations and the international order.</p>



<p>President Biden shared with President Xi a detailed review of how things have developed to this point, his assessment of the situation today, and President Biden underscored his support for a diplomatic resolution to the crisis.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The President described our assessment of Putin&#8217;s actions and his miscalculations.&nbsp; He also described the unity of the United States and its Allies and partners, the unprecedented coordination with our European, NATO, and Indo-Pacific partners, and the overwhelming global unity and condemnation of Russia &#8212; Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine, as well as the support for Ukraine.</p>



<p>President Biden made clear the implication and consequences of China providing material support &#8212; if China were to provide material support &#8212; to Russia as it prosecutes its brutal war in Ukraine, not just for China&#8217;s relationship with the United States but for the wider world. &nbsp;</p>



<p>And he stressed concerns, as you&#8217;ve heard us speak about more broadly, that Russia is spreading disinformation about biological weapons in Ukraine as a pretext for a false-flag operation and underscored concerns about echoing such disinformation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>President Xi raised Taiwan.&nbsp; President Biden reiterated that the United States remains committed to our one-China policy and is guided by the Taiwan Relations Act, the Three Joint Communiqués, and the Six Assurances.&nbsp; And he underscored the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The two leaders also discussed the importance of managing competition between the two countries &#8212; between the United States and China &#8212; of addressing areas of strategic risk and maintaining open lines of communication.&nbsp; And to that end, they tasked their teams to follow up on the leaders’ discussion in the days and weeks ahead.</p>



<p>Of course, today&#8217;s conversation followed up on National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan&#8217;s meeting with his counterpart in Rome earlier this week in which the two agreed that the two presidents would speak &#8212; again, as both sides believe that there is no substitute for leader-to-leader engagement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, as you all know, this call comes amid the intensive engagement we&#8217;ve had with allies and partners in Europe and the Indo-Pacific in recent weeks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And with that, I will be happy to take your questions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, [senior administration official].&nbsp; Thanks for doing this.&nbsp; First, I wanted to ask if President Biden warned Xi Jinping specifically about sanctions, or did he refer to more vague consequences should China provide any support for Russia in the war?&nbsp; And regardless, what was Xi&#8217;s response to that?</p>



<p>Yeah, I appreciate that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Of course.&nbsp; Well, thanks, Michael.&nbsp; So, you know, as I mentioned, the President described the implications, you know, if China provides material support to Russia as it prosecutes this brutal war, but I&#8217;m not going to talk &#8212; I&#8217;m not going to, sort of, publicly lay out our options from here.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We&#8217;re going to continue to talk directly with China, as well as to our Allies and partners, about the broader situation.&nbsp; And I will let the PRC characterize what Xi Jinping&#8217;s comments were.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Do you have an assessment of whether or not China has made a decision to go down this road with Russia?</p>



<p>And then, second: More broadly, was there any talk of, sort of, the commercial ramifications that have happened for Russia as a result of this war, with big Western companies leaving and the prospect that that could happen to China if they were to get involved in assisting?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Thanks, Aamer.&nbsp; On your first question, I&#8217;m not going to comment on specifics at this time.</p>



<p>On the question about the actions &#8212; the economic responses to Russia and the private sector: Yeah, I would say, you know, the President, you know, really laid out in a lot of detail the unified response from not only, you know, governments around the world but also the private sector, to Russia&#8217;s brutal aggression in Ukraine.</p>



<p>And, you know, the President made clear that, you know, there would be &#8212; that there would likely be consequences for those who are &#8212; who would &#8212; who would step in to support Russia at this time.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Can you tell me if the President expressly asked Xi &#8212; Xi Jinping &#8212; to intercede with Moscow, with Putin, to stop the war and specifically to withdraw from (inaudible)?</p>



<p>And did Xi offer in any way to use his influence with Putin to end the aggression?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Thanks, Ellen.&nbsp; Yeah, look, you know, the call wasn&#8217;t really &#8212; and I mean, the President really wasn&#8217;t making specific requests of China.&nbsp; He was laying out his assessment of the situation, what he thinks makes sense, and the implications of certain actions.</p>



<p>You know, I think our view is that China will make its own decisions, and so I’d describe that as sort of the nature of the call.&nbsp; And again, on any response from President Xi, you know, you&#8217;d have to talk to Beijing.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, everyone.&nbsp; Thank you so much for doing the call.&nbsp; Can you tell us if President Xi made any guarantees to President Biden that he would not help Russia?</p>



<p>And did the President come away from the call with a sense that President Xi is ready to condemn the invasion?&nbsp; Because China&#8217;s still hasn&#8217;t done that publicly.&nbsp; Did President Xi condemn the invasion in this call, or did President Biden come away with this with a sense that he will do so?&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Yeah, look, on your first question, you know, China will make its own decisions.&nbsp; And I think you probably have seen the readout that they have put out; I would refer you to that as their characterization of President Xi&#8217;s words.</p>



<p>You know, as I said, I think the President was &#8212; President Biden was candid and direct in discussing his assessment of the situation and, you know, what he believes would be necessary, in order to find a diplomatic resolution to the crisis.</p>



<p>But, you know, I think, in terms of what President Xi said, again, I&#8217;m going to leave it to the Chinese side to characterize their words.</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Can we do our next question, please?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks so much.&nbsp; And thanks for doing this.&nbsp; Two questions for you.&nbsp; Did President Biden get the sense that President Xi was caught off guard by the nature of the Russian invasion and how it&#8217;s gone?&nbsp; And during this two-hour call, did Xi ever refer to it as an invasion?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Sorry, I was taking down notes to make sure I remember your questions.<br><br>     You know, look, on the first question: You know, I think, you know, the National Security Advisor has &#8212; has spoken publicly about our assessment of Beijing&#8217;s reaction to the invasion.  And so, I will just point you to his comments.  I don&#8217;t have them exactly in front of me, but I think he&#8217;s been on the record about this.<br><br>     You know, and in terms of how Xi referred to &#8212; you know, referred to the situation, again, I would just point you to their own words as they have characterized them.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, [senior administration official].&nbsp; Thanks for doing the call.&nbsp; Can you just share a little bit of color on whether the President felt more or less optimistic about where China st- &#8212; where President Xi stands on the issue of Ukraine after this call?<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And just a follow-up: The Chinese readout suggests that President Xi complained to President Biden about people in the U.S. sending wrong signals to Taiwan&#8217;s independence forces.&nbsp; Can you detail President Biden&#8217;s response to this?&nbsp; Thanks.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Thanks so much, Patsy.&nbsp; Look, I &#8212; you know, I think, as we felt with the conversation in Rome with Director Yang earlier this week and the conversation with, you know, President Xi here today, this was really about President Biden being able to lay out very clearly in substantial detail, with a lot of facts, and a lot of just &#8212; you know, really walking President Xi through the situation, making very, very clear our views, the views of others, what we have laid out in the previous months and the actions we&#8217;re taking now.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I think it was the &#8212; I think, from our perspective, we will &#8212; we will see what decisions China makes in the days and weeks ahead.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so, I think it was sort of less about coming away with a particular view out of the conversation today and more about making sure, again, that they were able to really have that direct, candid and detailed and very substantive conversation at the leader level.&nbsp; And we know there really is no replacement for that.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, that&#8217;s how I would think about the conversation today.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In terms of the question about Taiwan, President Biden was very clear that our policy has not changed, that &#8212; you know, he reiterated our one-China policy based on the Taiwan Relations Act, the Three Communiqués, the Six Assurances.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And he underscored, as well, concerns about Beijing&#8217;s coercive and provocative actions across the Taiwan Strait.&nbsp; President Biden made clear that we remain opposed to any unilateral changes to the status quo across the Taiwan Strait.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, you know, I would just remind, obviously, that President Biden himself voted for the Taiwan Relations Act, and he&#8217;s firmly committed to the principles in it, and that the Biden administration has consistently demonstrated rock-solid support for Taiwan and will continue to do so.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, again, you know, President Biden&#8217;s response was really about just reaffirming our continued, consistent policy &#8212; very longstanding policy &#8212; while underscoring concerns about Beijing&#8217;s coercive and provocative actions across the Strait.</p>



<p>MODERATOR:  Great.  Thanks, [senior administration official].  And thanks, everyone, for joining. <br><br>     You know, again, very sorry for the delay.  You know, I know we&#8217;ll have a press briefing shortly, so hopefully more questions can be taken there.  And then if there&#8217;s still more that you all need, we&#8217;re here to provide any sort of help that you might &#8212; you might need.<br><br>     So, just as a reminder, this call was on background, attributable to a “senior administration official.”  And the embargo on the contents of the call have now lifted. <br><br>     So, thanks again, everyone.  Have a good day.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">South Court Auditorium</p>



<p>1:40 P.M. EDT</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Well, look, let me get started here.&nbsp; I want to say good afternoon, everybody.&nbsp;<br><br>This week, I signed into law the bipartisan government funding bill, demonstrating again that the American people &#8212; that Democrats and Republicans and independents can come together and do some big things.<br><br>This bill includes something I’ve believed in for a long, long time: ARPA-H, an Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health.&nbsp; It&#8217;s based &#8212; as Dr. Tompkins knows, it&#8217;s based on the Defense Department&#8217;s Advanced Research Projects Agency that has led for break- &#8212; led breakthroughs in technologies that protect our security, everything from the Internet to GPS and so much more.<br><br>ARPA-H will have a singular purpose: to drive breakthroughs in biomedicine; to prevent, detect, and treat diseases, including cancer, Alzheimer&#8217;s, and diabetes.&nbsp;<br><br>And I want to thank the bipartisan members of the House and Senate who are working so hard to get this done: Senators Patrick Leahy, Patty Murphy [Murray], Roy Blunt, Richard Burr; Representatives Anna Eshoo and Rosa DeLauro, Frank Pallone, Diana Degette, Fred Upton.<br><br>Like DARPA, ARPA-H will pursue ideas that break the mold on how we normally support fundamental research and commercial products in this country.&nbsp;<br><br>Ideas so bold no one else, not even the private sector, is willing to give them a chance or to sink a lot of money into trying to solve.<br><br>Ideas so audacious that people say they just might work only &#8212; if only we could try.<br><br>Well, we’re about to try in a big way.&nbsp; And that’s what this meeting is about.&nbsp; Because ARPA-H is modeled after DARPA, and I’ve asked the DARPA Director, Stefanie Tompkins, to speak about the promise of ARPA-H.&nbsp;<br><br>In fact, we&#8217;re going to hear from a patient who benefitted from the DARPA research.&nbsp; And it enabled him to use a prosthetic arm that moves but also provides a sense of touch, which he couldn&#8217;t do before and we couldn&#8217;t do before.<br><br>Imagine losing your arm in a war or an accident and regaining the ability to feel &#8212; to actually feel &#8212; what it&#8217;s like to hold the hand of a spouse or a child.&nbsp; It&#8217;s remarkable.<br><br>We&#8217;ll also hear from Dr. Al- &#8212; I&#8217;m going to mispronounce &#8212; I&#8217;ll just &#8212; Dr. Nelson, who leads the White House Office on Science and Technology, and my science advisor, Dr. Francis Collins, to talk about how we ensure ARPA-H is &#8212; harnesses the powers and possibilities of science and technology to benefit all of America; to focus on equity, because every American should have access to cutting-edge healthcare innovations; and to make it impossible &#8212; make the impossible possible.<br><br>And you’ve heard me say over and over again, America can be defined in a single word: possibilities.&nbsp;<br><br>I&#8217;m going to stop there so we can get this meeting started, and then I&#8217;m going to turn to Dr. Nelson.<br><br>So, let me begin.&nbsp; Dr. Nelson.<br><br>1:44 P.M. EDT</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>Each year, more than 2 million poisoning cases are reported in the United States &#8212; some of which are tragically fatal, but many of which are preventable.&nbsp; While we have made great strides in the decades since National Poison Prevention Week was first observed 60 years ago &#8212; including a decline in unintentional poisoning &#8212; poisoning remains a risk, especially for children and older Americans.&nbsp; During National Poison Prevention Week, we raise awareness about the dangers posed by poisonous substances, precautions people can take to prevent an incident, and how to respond in a poison emergency.</p>



<p>     Each year, an average of 31 children die from unintended poisonings at home, and an estimated 75,000 children under the age of five end up in hospital emergency departments from poisoning.  Approximately 85 percent of unintentional poisonings take place in the home where medicines and harmful chemicals are stored.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To prevent children from unintentionally ingesting poisonous household products, it is important to keep these products out of their sight and beyond their reach. &nbsp;Items such as hand sanitizer, laundry detergent, medications, coin cell batteries, cleaning products, and liquid nicotine should be stored in child-resistant packaging.&nbsp; Medications should be safely secured, and if unused, properly discarded.&nbsp; For elderly Americans &#8212; particularly those who may have become isolated due to the pandemic &#8212; it is important that household products are secured in their original packaging and that medications are clearly labeled to avoid accidental ingestion or the mistaking of medications.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Health professionals working around the clock and responding to millions of calls each year at poison control centers are critical to our Nation&#8217;s response.&nbsp; They not only help the public in need of assistance or information, they are also a tremendous asset to health care providers, health departments, law enforcement, and first responders.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you suspect that you or someone else has been poisoned, do not wait for signs of poisoning. &nbsp;Immediately call the Poison Control Help line at 800-222-1222.&nbsp; For more information, go to poisonhelp.hrsa.gov.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Poison awareness, control, and education are essential to saving lives. &nbsp;During National Poison Prevention Week, we recommit to raising awareness about the dangers of accidental poisonings and taking the necessary precautions to prevent and respond quickly to these incidents and protect our loved ones.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To encourage Americans to learn more about the dangers of unintentional poisonings and to take appropriate preventive measures, on September 26, 1961, the United States Congress, by joint resolution (75 Stat. 681), authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation designating the third week of March each year as &#8220;National Poison Prevention Week.&#8221;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim March 20 through March 26, 2022, to be National Poison Prevention Week. &nbsp;I call upon all Americans to observe this week by taking actions to safeguard their families and friends from poisonous products, chemicals, and medicines often found in our homes, and to raise awareness of these dangers to prevent accidental injuries and deaths.</p>



<p>     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighteenth day of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-sixth.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-right">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">East Room</p>



<p>5:47 P.M. EDT</p>



<p>PRESIDENT BIDEN:&nbsp; Well, Happy Saint Patrick’s Day, everyone.&nbsp; It&#8217;s great to see you all here.&nbsp; And last year, because of the pandemic, the Taoiseach and I had to hold our meeting virtually.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How you doing, pal?&nbsp; We got all the Irish here today.&nbsp; (Laughter.)</p>



<p>And this is the first year we’ve had to make some last-minute adjustments as well.&nbsp; Sadly, the Taoiseach and Ms. Martin are not able to join us today, but they both sent their love and their message for this occasion.</p>



<p>And I spoke with the Taoiseach at length this morning, and we had a virtual meeting &#8212; bilateral meeting.&nbsp; He is feeling well.&nbsp; And I share his disappointment that we weren’t able to have our meetings in person as we had planned.</p>



<p>This year marks the 70th year of Ireland sending shamrocks to the White House and &#8212; to celebrate the friendship between our nations and the bond &#8212; the bond that has been strengthened by generations of Irish Americans.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Apparently, President Truman was away when the Irish ambassador dropped off the first bowl of shamrocks in &#8212; and that&#8217;s why I just removed his bust from my office.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; That&#8217;s a joke.&nbsp; That&#8217;s a joke.&nbsp; That&#8217;s a joke.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t do that.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t do that.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; I&#8217;m sure he would have been there had he known.&nbsp; (Laughter.)</p>



<p>A virtual meeting back then was sort of out of the question.&nbsp; But by the next year, President Eisenhower was able to accept in person.&nbsp; A joyful tradition was born at that moment when he accepted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, to everyone here today: Welcome back to the White House.&nbsp; It&#8217;s so nice to be able to have you all back inside the White House.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>There are so many friends here &#8212; so many friends here: Irish, Irish Americans, Americans who wish they were Irish.&nbsp; (Laughter.)</p>



<p>As my grandfather used to say &#8212; our grandfather &#8212; my sister Valerie is here, my daughter Ashley is here, my brother-in-law, my brother and my other sister-in-law, my niece.&nbsp; We&#8217;re all here.&nbsp; But I&#8217;m probably the only one old enough to remember my grandfather, Ambrose Finnegan, as well you might expect someone when they were that age.</p>



<p>And he used to have an expression.&nbsp; He&#8217;d say, “If you’re lucky enough to be Irish, you’re lucky enough.”&nbsp; And so &#8212; (laughter and applause).&nbsp;</p>



<p>There&#8217;s a lot of proud Irish American members in my administration.&nbsp; But there’s one person here I want to recognize in particular in my administration: my Secretary of Labor.&nbsp; I&#8217;d understand him if he spoke better &#8212; if he spoke Gaelic instead of Boston.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Where are you, Marty Walsh?</p>



<p>AUDIENCE MEMBER:&nbsp; Right here.</p>



<p>PRESIDENT BIDEN:&nbsp; There you are, Marty.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Marty Walsh.&nbsp; From Galway &#8212; his parents are from Galway.&nbsp; I tell you what, I &#8212; I don&#8217;t know.&nbsp; Like I said, if you spoke Gaelic, I&#8217;d understand it better than, you know, the (inaudible) and all of that.</p>



<p>Look, a proud son of two Irish immigrants to this country who found their way in America and to America, and dream through their union membership, and all the work that this man did to promote the union movement.</p>



<p>And to all the members of the House and Senate that are here &#8212; you have to hear me again, a lot of you.&nbsp; I apologize.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I look at one Irishman, Bobby Casey, over here.&nbsp; He&#8217;s from &#8212; we&#8217;re from the same hometown: Scranton, Pennsylvania.&nbsp; Right, Bobby?&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I knew Bobby&#8217;s dad well.&nbsp; He was a hell of a guy.&nbsp; And we lived literally four, five city blocks apart from one another.&nbsp; The problem is that I&#8217;m older than Bobby as his father was than me, so we&#8217;re right in the middle there.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the best thing Bobby has going for him is a magnificent wife and his mother is a saint.&nbsp; God love her.&nbsp; And tell Mom I said hi, will you?&nbsp; For real.</p>



<p>Look, our new ambassador to Ireland can’t be with us today, but I’m very pleased that Claire Cronin from Boston has officially begun her work in Dublin.</p>



<p>I just got off a video with her on &#8212; on the phone, and she was mildly tearful.&nbsp; She wanted to be here with everyone, but &#8212; and I wish you all are going to get to meet her.&nbsp; She&#8217;s really quite a person.</p>



<p>And usually, in Washington, as &#8212; I&#8217;m usually referred to as Jill Biden’s husband, which I&#8217;m proud of.&nbsp; But today, I’m Catherine Eugenia Finnegan Biden&#8217;s son.&nbsp; That&#8217;s who I am.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>And &#8212; and Jimmy, Val, and I &#8212; we come by our love for Ireland honestly.&nbsp; It’s been more than 165 years since our great-great-grandparents left County Mayo and County Louth aboard a coffin ship to cross the Atlantic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, I want to ask my relatives from County Louth to stand up, the three of them.&nbsp; Come on.&nbsp; Stand up, guys.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>Now, you see this guy here on the end?&nbsp; He&#8217;s probably the single most famous rugby played in all of Ireland.&nbsp; And he scored the winning goal against the All Blacks when he beat them in Chicago.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; And he&#8217;s my cousin.&nbsp; Good to have you, man.&nbsp; Good to have you.</p>



<p>And the Blewitts and Finnegans eventually settled in Scranton, Pennsylvania, where my grandparents &#8212; where my parents met and married.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s where my mom, Catherine Eugenia Finnegan, was born and later, as I said, met Joseph Robinette Biden, the Sr.&nbsp;</p>



<p>His saving grace was his mother was a Hanafee &#8212; his mother&#8217;s side, they had a Hanafee from Galway.&nbsp; That saved him in the family.&nbsp; That saved him up in Scranton.</p>



<p>Being Irish, as my mother always told me, is about family, it’s about faith, and it’s about courage.&nbsp; Mom used to have an expression.&nbsp; My brother and sister will remember.&nbsp; She&#8217;d say, &#8220;Courage is the greatest of all virtues because without it, you could not love with abandon.&#8221;&nbsp; &#8220;Courage is the greatest of all virtues because without it, you could not love with abandon.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Growing up an Irish American gave me a pride that spoke both &#8212; to both continents.&nbsp; The heart and soul that drew it from old and new.&nbsp;&nbsp;And the conviction that everyone &#8212; everyone is deserving of being treated with dignity.</p>



<p>I was mentioning today: I think it&#8217;s fair to say &#8212; I can&#8217;t prove this, but I think it&#8217;s fair to say I&#8217;ve never heard the word &#8220;dignity&#8221; used as much as I have among the Irish.&nbsp; Because the deprivation of the &#8212; being treated with dignity is understood.&nbsp; Dignity.</p>



<p>One of my great-uncles wrote from Ire- &#8212; wrote from the United States, after he made it to America, one of those letter they used to call “Amerikay” letters back to his loved ones in Ireland, yearning for home.</p>



<p>He wrote, “If there was a road made of furze….&#8221;&nbsp; Furze is a yellow flower with thorns in it.&nbsp; &#8220;If there was a road….&#8221;&nbsp; He said, &#8220;If there was a road made of furze in America from America to Ireland, I’d walk it in my bare feet.&nbsp; I&#8217;d walk it in my bare feet.&#8221;</p>



<p>Our great-grandfather, Edward Francis Blewitt, was only the second Catholic ever elected to the state senate &#8212; we talked about this, Gov &#8212; in the state of Pennsylvania.&nbsp; The first one was in the early 1880s, and &#8212; but I think he was &#8212; he was the second.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And he was elected &#8212; when he was elected office, he had a &#8212; my great-grandfather was &#8212; had an engineering degree from Lafayette College and he had the heart of an Irish poet.&nbsp; He wrote over 200 poems.&nbsp; And fortunately, our Uncle Ed left the poems.&nbsp; I have them all.&nbsp; I’ve had them bound.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And he wrote a poem about “his Ireland.”&nbsp; I want to read one of his stanzas of the poem.&nbsp; He said: “From the fairest land, except my own…”&nbsp;nor sun &#8212; ‘neath these &#8212; excuse me &#8212;<br>“…‘Neath sun or star or moon, the citadel of Liberty, My mother’s land, aroon.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course,&nbsp;I am not the first Irish American descendent to &#8212; not by a long shot &#8212; to be in this &#8212; in the White House.&nbsp; Fully half of American presidents can claim some ancestral connection to Ireland, including the man who held this job&nbsp;when I was Vice President, Barack Obama.</p>



<p>But it was John F. Kennedy, our &#8212; and his &#8212;</p>



<p>Would you stand up, Ambassador?&nbsp; Come on.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>&#8212; our first Irish-Catholic president who visited Ireland in 1963 and said, quote, “Our two nations,&nbsp;divided by distance,&nbsp;have been united by history.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Well, that’s as true today as it was then.&nbsp; Today, those words feel particularly poignant as Ireland and the United States&nbsp;stand united at this momentous point of history.</p>



<p>Vladimir Putin &#8212; Vladimir Putin has launched an unconscionable war against Ukraine, against the very pillars&nbsp;of international peace and stability.</p>



<p>And as two nations that have fought for freedom, we recognize the courage and determination&nbsp;of the Ukrainian people who defend their liberty now.&nbsp; And they do.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Republic of Ireland and our nation have lived through war.&nbsp; We’re determined, though, to help the Ukrainian people, bring an end to Putin’s brutal assault, and restore peace to the Ukrainian people.</p>



<p>As nations that have been marked by emigrants&nbsp;who departed Ireland in coffin ships and the immigrants who sought the safety&nbsp;of new beginnings in the United States, we are open &#8212; and our hearts are open and our arms&nbsp;are open &#8212; to help the more than 3 million Ukrainian refugees who have already fled Putin’s onslaught.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>And today, as the Taoiseach and I affirmed earlier today, Ireland and the United States are going to stay united together with our partners around the world to keep the pressure on Putin and&nbsp;to strengthen our support for Ukraine.</p>



<p>And, by the way, Ireland is supporting the economic sanctions &#8212; taking a gigantic hit, a gigantic hit &#8212; proportionally, more than we have.&nbsp; It took a hell of a lot of courage for the Taoiseach and the Dáil to stand up and do what they did.&nbsp; And I really mean it.&nbsp; You know that, Mr. Ambassador.&nbsp; You know what it’s like.</p>



<p>We’ve also discussed how the United States and Ireland&nbsp;will take on all the challenges we face together.&nbsp;&nbsp;We’re working together to fight COVID-19 and to save lives around the world, to tackle the climate crisis, and to boost global economic recovery.&nbsp;&nbsp;And we’re working &#8212; for real &#8212; side-by-side&nbsp;in the United Nations Security Council, which they’re now members of,&nbsp;to address the humanitarian crisis not only in Ukraine but around the world.</p>



<p>And our nations both are deeply committed to protecting the hard-won gains of peace&nbsp;in Northern Ireland.&nbsp; The Good Friday Agreement&nbsp;has been the foundation of peace and prosperity&nbsp;in Northern Ireland for nearly 25 years, and it cannot change.&nbsp; Cannot change.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>I have made that point &#8212; and he’s a friend &#8212; to the Prime Minister of England and others: It cannot change.&nbsp; To preserve and extend those gains for all the people in Northern Ireland, <s>and</s> the European Union <s>to make</s> [and] the United Kingdom must continue to resolve challenges over the implementation of the Northern Ireland Protocols.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The United States stands ready to work with all the communities of Northern Ireland to ensure &#8212; to ensure its extraordinary economic potential and ensure that it’s realized.&nbsp; And we look forward to supporting&nbsp;the next Northern Ireland Executive&nbsp;after the upcoming Assembly elections, which are on their way.</p>



<p>History has proven that &#8212; what the people of Northern Ireland and their leaders can accomplish when they work together.&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeats wrote &#8212; can I quote an Irish poet?&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; He wrote the line in one of his poems, “Hope that you may understand.”&nbsp; “Hope that you may understand.”&nbsp; Because for the Irish and for all us Irish Americans, the hoping is essential to understanding and to life, from our perspective.</p>



<p>Hope is what brought forth on the Emerald Isle a nation of poets and patriots, saints, scholars, artists, and engineers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hope kept us looking toward the far horizon.&nbsp; It urges us &#8212; urges us to &#8212; over every obstacle.&nbsp; It tells us to try again when we fall short, to rise each time we fall.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our mom used to have an expression, “As long as you’re alive, you have an obligation to strive.&nbsp; And you’re not dead until you’ve seen the face of God.”&nbsp; And she meant it.&nbsp; She meant it.</p>



<p>Well, in my view, that’s the Irish of it.&nbsp; And hope is what brought us &#8212; the Irish American kid&nbsp;all the way from Scranton to Wil- &#8212; Scranton to the White House.&nbsp; And with a lifetime of history of hoping comes the deep understanding of what our nations&nbsp;and our people&nbsp;can accomplish.&nbsp; Hope was what brought us here.</p>



<p>And around the same time, my great-great-grandfather Owen Finnegan, a shoemaker, boarded a coffin ship in 1844 in the Irish Sea with another &#8212; near &#8212; five weeks after another shoemaker named Joseph Kearny from Moneygall arrived on another ship in America just five weeks earlier.&nbsp; That was President Obama’s great-great-grandfather.</p>



<p>They were both shoemakers not far from one another.&nbsp; When we were here &#8212; when I first got that &#8212; the genealogy done by the LDS &#8212; by the Mormon’s Church &#8212; the most extensive biological &#8212; archaeologic &#8212; most extensive records on genealogy.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; I’m getting into biology here.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>And they said it was not sure they’d be able to see one another.&nbsp; But when I went over to Ireland, quote, with my family to go home to meet some of my relatives that I didn’t know &#8212; our relatives we didn’t know &#8212; they indicated the likelihood they were both shoemakers, both not far from one another, both leaving for America five weeks apart &#8212; it is not improbable that they’ve would’ve known one another.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They left everything behind, like all of your relatives, for an uncertain future.&nbsp; But I wonder, in all of their dreams, whether they could’ve ever dreamt that their two great-great-grandsons of shoemakers from Ireland would be sworn in as Presidents of the United States of America.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; I wonder.&nbsp;<br><br>It’s not about me.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not about Barack.&nbsp; It’s about hope.&nbsp; Think about it.<br><br>But again, as my grandpop would say, “That’s the Irish of it.”<br><br>So I want to again thank the Taoiseach for making the trip to Washington, even though he cannot be with us today, and for continuing to strengthen the relationship between our two great nations.<br><br>And now, we have a special message from the Taoiseach.</p>



<p>(A video message from Prime Minister Martin is played.)<br><br>PRIME MINISTER MARTIN:&nbsp; Mr. President, First Lady, senators, representatives, ladies and gentlemen, as we gather this year to mark St. Patrick&#8217;s Day, an annual occasion that means so much to so many Americans and to Irish people everywhere, we do so in the consciousness that these are not normal times.<br><br>We are reminded by the appalling events in Ukraine that freedom and democracy can never be taken for granted. &nbsp;Each generation must be ready to stand up and defend them.<br><br>We are reminded also of the lengths that those who oppose democracy are prepared to go to stop others enjoying its benefits.<br><br>In the people of Ukraine, we are reminded of the boundless bravery and resolve of those who love their country and who value its freedom.&nbsp; And importantly, we are reminded of the importance of the shared values and principles which are the bedrock of the enduring friendship between our countries.<br><br>As we confront this crisis, I am reminded of the words of James Joyce, put into the mouth of his 20th century everyman, Leopold Bloom, in “Ulysses,” published a century ago this year by an American woman in Paris, Sylvia Beach.<br><br>Joyce wrote, “Force, hatred, history, all that.&nbsp; That&#8217;s not life for men and women, insult and hatred.&nbsp; And everybody knows that it&#8217;s the very opposite of that that is really life.”&nbsp; And that is why we stand together to ensure that what Joyce described as “perpetuating national hatred among nations” shall not prevail in our time.<br><br>This ceremony has a long history.&nbsp; And yet, it has perhaps never meant as much to us as it does this year.&nbsp; And that is because, more than any other president of our times, your family&#8217;s story captures the overlapping stories of Ireland and American.<br><br>The shamrock presented to you today recalls the lives of the Blewitts of County Mayo and the Finnegans from County Louth.&nbsp; I took the opportunity to have the bowl inscribed especially for you in the Irish language, knowing how you would value that.<br><br>Your family&#8217;s perilous journey across the Atlantic, and those of the other Irish names that adorn your family tree, reflect the experience of the millions of Irish people who left their homeland in the 19th century to seek better lives for themselves.<br><br>The departure of so many people from our shores, many at a very young age, left a huge gap in our society and deposited oceans of pain in the hearts of those they left behind, longing for departed family members they never saw again.<br><br>In more recent times, our diaspora has been an inestimable source of strength to us in the search and achievement of peace and political progress in Northern Ireland.<br><br>Mr. President, I salute the immense contribution made by the Congressional Friends of Ireland, of which you were a founding member back in 1981.<br><br>Their efforts were instrumental in securing indispensable American support for the peace process that culminated in the Good Friday Agreement &#8212; an achievement in which I know that you and many other Americans take justifiable pride.<br><br>Your support, Mr. President, and that of our friends in Congress continues to be a vital importance as we seek to protect the Good Friday Agreement from the complications created by the British decision to leave the European Union.<br><br>The United States will always be an influential source of support for the cause of peace and reconciliation in Ireland, something for which we are deeply appreciative.<br><br>Mr. President, your family&#8217;s experience is not just woven into the story of Ireland its immigrants, it is also an integral part of the American story.<br><br>Your Irish ancestors and millions of others from Ireland and around the world strove in their lives to make America the country it is today.&nbsp;<br><br>Their labor, in many cases, literally built America.&nbsp; Theirs was no easy street.&nbsp; As the Irish poet Eavan Boland once wrote, “They would have thrived on our necessities.&nbsp; What they survived we could not even live…Their hardships parceled in them.&nbsp; Patience.&nbsp; Fortitude…And all the old songs.&nbsp; And nothing to lose.”<br><br>Irish Americans rose to occupy prominent positions in every walk of American life, including today in this White House, designed by an Irish architect, James Hoban.<br><br>Your country was transformed in the 50 years after the Civil War, at a time when immigration, including from Ireland, was at its peak.<br><br>For them and countless others like them, America became what Seamus Heaney calls “the further shore” where “the longed-for tidal wave of justice can rise up, and hope and history rhyme.”<br><br>Happy St. Patrick&#8217;s Day, and have a great evening.<br><br>(The video message from Prime Minister Martin concludes.)</p>



<p>(Applause.)</p>



<p>PRESIDENT BIDEN:&nbsp; Mr. Ambassador, you got to tell him how much he&#8217;s appreciated.&nbsp; Genuinely.<br><br>Thank you, thank you, thank you.<br><br>Folks, now we have &#8212; I don&#8217;t know who&#8217;s going to do the introducing, but now we&#8217;re going to have entertainment that is all Irish.&nbsp; And so, you’ll get me to sit down &#8212; I sit down.&nbsp; And they&#8217;re going to clear the stage.<br><br>And as my &#8212; my father said &#8212; my father &#8212; our father used to have a band when he was a kid.&nbsp; He played the saxophone and the clarinet, and he could dance and he could sing.&nbsp; And he used to say, “Joey, I don&#8217;t know where the hell you came from.&nbsp; You have no lip&#8221; &#8212; (laughter) &#8212; &#8220;you have two left feet, and you can&#8217;t carry a tune in a wheelbarrow.”&nbsp; So I&#8217;m getting the hell off the stage.<br><br>Thank you.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">James S. Brady Press Briefing Room</p>



<p>2:55 P.M. EDT<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Hi, everyone.&nbsp; Sorry, I think I jumped the two-minute gun.&nbsp; I was just excited to see you all on St. Patrick&#8217;s Day.&nbsp;<br><br>Okay, a couple of items for all of you at the top.&nbsp; Today, we wanted to highlight the strong unemployment claim data out this morning.&nbsp; In a little over a year, President Biden has brought the American labor market back to one of its strongest positions in history, driving a robust recovery from the economic catastrophe he inherited.&nbsp;<br><br>The number of new jobless claims Americans filing for unemployment for the first time fell below the pre-pandemic average in 2019.&nbsp; And the number of Americans who have been receiving unemployment benefits for more than a week fell to the lowest level since 1970.&nbsp;<br><br>Three hundred thousand fewer Americans are receiving unemployment claims now than before the pandemic.&nbsp; That means more Americans are getting back to work and fewer are drawing governmental &#8212; government benefits.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>As we&#8217;ve said many times, the data can be volatile week to week or month to month, so it&#8217;s important to focus on the broader trends.&nbsp; And those trends show remarkable progress across our economy over the last year, including the fastest year of job growth in U.S. history with 7.4 million jobs created and unemployment down to 3.8 percent.&nbsp;<br><br>I also wanted to mark another historic milestone of 500 million vaccines that we have distributed to the world &#8212; an unprecedented campaign reaching 113 countries, something that has never been done before.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>We did not get here by accident.&nbsp; This is a testament to the same whole-of-government effort we applied domestically, navigating logistical, legal, and regulatory processes to get lifesaving vaccines across the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>As we mark today&#8217;s milestone of delivering a half a billion vaccines to the world, let me be clear: Without additional funding from Congress to support getting shots into arms, USAID will have to cut short our crucial and effective efforts to turn vaccines into vaccinations.&nbsp;<br><br>Congress must promptly provide the administration with the urgent funding we need to continue the work of both vaccinating the world and protecting Americans at home.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Last thing I just wanted to note: As you saw this morning reported, Jeff Zients, who has served as our COVID Coordinator, will soon be leaving.&nbsp; So I just wanted to take a moment just to note his service and thank him from the President and all of us.<br><br>The President called on Jeff to lead our COVID-19 response because there is no one better at delivering results.&nbsp; I know this personally.&nbsp; I worked closely with him through many challenges over the course of many years in public service and government.&nbsp;<br><br>And the thing about Jeff is at every moment, at every opportunity, when there is a big challenge &#8212; a pile of manure sometimes &#8212; he dives right in to fix the challenge.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s what he does.&nbsp; That is what he has done time and time again through his career in public service.&nbsp;<br><br>And he led this effort to stand up a mass vaccination campaign; achieve equity in vaccinations across communities; ensure that Americans have access to treatments, tests; and embark on an unprecedented global vaccine campaign that we celebrate &#8212; can celebrate today.&nbsp; It would not have happened without Jeff Zients in this job and in this role.<br><br>And we are stronger that he is &#8212; his service and the service of his deputy, Natalie Quillian, who&#8217;s also departing, has literally saved lives in this country.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>So we want to thank them for their work, for their leadership, and we will miss them a great deal here.&nbsp;<br><br>Zeke, why don&#8217;t you kick us off?<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp;&nbsp; First, on COVID, the President has had a couple of close calls over the last couple days &#8212; the Second Gentleman and the Irish Prime Minister last night.&nbsp; Has he been tested today?&nbsp; And did he test &#8212; is there a result of that test you can read out?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; He was not tested today.&nbsp; He was tested last Sunday. &nbsp;Neither of these individuals were considered close contacts.<br><br>The doctors at the CDC determine what “close contacts” look like.&nbsp; And that &#8212; a close contact is someone who was less than six feet away from an infective &#8212; infected person for a cumulative total of 15 minutes or more over a 24-hour period.&nbsp; That is how they define it.&nbsp;<br><br>And, of course, our doctors look closely at that as well.&nbsp; And neither of these two individuals was &#8212; did he spend that amount of time with.&nbsp; And so, his weekly testing cadence remains as it has been; it has not changed.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I know there are a number of particular precautions that exist, you know, to protect the President and keep him safe and healthy.&nbsp; The testing cadence here is not like most people &#8212; or it has &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; That’s true.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; but this broader issue, though, of, you know, the President coming into &#8212; maybe not CDC “close contact,” but having close exposure to some people, even for a brief amount of time, it sort of &#8212; you know &#8212; you know, getting into that bubble around the President.&nbsp; You know, this is something that people around the country are dealing with on a daily basis, but they don&#8217;t have the same sort of precautions that are here.&nbsp;<br><br>So, you know, if the President hypothetically were to come down with COVID, is that something &#8212; or any &#8212; or the First Lady or anyone else in this administration &#8212; is that a failure at this point?&nbsp; Or is this just a new fact of life that everyone has to sort of, you know, make &#8212; you know, make peace with at this point?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well &#8212; (a cellphone chimes) &#8212; that was very soothing.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know where that came from.&nbsp; (Laughter.)<br><br>I would say our view is: While we&#8217;ve made a significant amount of progress across the country in fighting the pandemic &#8212; with more than 75 percent of adults fully vaccinated, according to the definition of the CDC &#8212; and obviously, we&#8217;ve seen hospitalizations come down across the country, including Washington, D.C., the President was very clear when he made his remarks about COVID just a few weeks ago that we are still working &#8212; we still have work to do to address the pandemic, to fight the pandemic.&nbsp;<br><br>That&#8217;s exactly why we need additional funding to make sure we have the types of treatments, the types of testing mechanisms to make them free and available to Americans across the country, to make masks available so that people who are uninsured or people who don&#8217;t have the resources can tap into a lot of these &#8212; these effective treatments and effective prevention mechanisms.&nbsp;<br><br>I would say, for us, you&#8217;re right, the testing &#8212; the testing modes are a little bit different around here because we are around the President of the United States and the Vice President and, of course, the First Lady and the Second Gentleman.&nbsp; That means, before you see the President, if you are in for a meeting or you travel with him, you are tested.&nbsp; And everyone has different testing cadences, depending on their frequency of seeing him.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, in anticipation of the call between the President and President Xi tomorrow, has the U.S. government made a determination whether China has decided whether or not to, you know, sort of agree to Russia&#8217;s request to provide assistance for its invasion of Ukraine?&nbsp; Is that &#8212; is it still a live ball that the President is going to warn President Xi of off of?&nbsp;&nbsp; Where are they in terms of making that decision?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; Well, why don&#8217;t I give you a little bit more of a preview on the call, and hopefully it will answer exactly your question.&nbsp;<br><br>The President, as I think you&#8217;ve heard him say before and I&#8217;ve said, is a big believer in leader-to-leader diplomacy.&nbsp; And they have a lot to discuss, given the last time the President met with President Xi virtually was last November &#8212; a couple of months ago.<br><br>The meeting tomorrow, in terms of how we got here, came as a direct follow-up to the meeting national &#8212; our national Security Advisor, Jake Sullivan, had with his counterpart.&nbsp; They talked about the two presidents meeting or engaging in the near future during that meeting.&nbsp; So, hence, it is happening tomorrow.&nbsp;<br><br>And that meeting, earlier this week, of course, came at an important moment in the conflict, but it also &#8212; in Ukraine, of course &#8212; it also covered issues beyond Russia&#8217;s invasion, and I would expect &#8212; of Ukraine &#8212; I would expect this meeting would as well, because there are obviously a range of issues that we continue to discuss with the Chinese and the President discusses, of course, when he speaks with President Xi.&nbsp;<br><br>But to go to your question, this is an opportunity for President Biden to assess where President Xi stands.&nbsp; There has been, of course, rhetorical support, or the absence of clear rhetoric and denunciation &#8212; or the absence of denunciation by China of what Russia is doing.&nbsp; This flies in the face, of course, of everything China stands for, including the basic principles of the U.N. Charter, including the basic principles of respect for sovereignty of nations.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>And so, the fact that China has not denounced what Russia is doing, in and of itself, speaks volumes.&nbsp; And it also speaks volumes not only in Russia or in Ukraine, but around the world.&nbsp;<br><br>And this call also comes as the &#8212; as Jake Sullivan&#8217;s meeting earlier this week, as we have made clear our deep concerns about China&#8217;s alignment with Russia and the potential implications and consequences of that.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>So the President will also share his assessment of that during the call, but I don&#8217;t have another &#8212; an update for you on any internal assessment.&nbsp; That is just how we are approaching &#8212; or he is approaching the call tomorrow.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How specific is the President going to be in laying out the consequences for China if they do help Russia?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, the President is &#8212; never fails to be direct, including in his conversations with President Xi.&nbsp; But we&#8217;ll let the call happen, and I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll have more to read out for you after the call.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And do you have any idea what military equipment they are thinking about providing Russia?&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have any assessment of that from here.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; And what do you make of the Putin comments basically calling for a purge of anti-war opponents?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I think this is a clear sign that this war is not going how President Putin planned for it to go.&nbsp; And there has been an outpouring of courageous protests and many speaking out against the war, even within Russia.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>So, his effort to crack down on dissent, to crack down on the freedom of press, on the freedom of media, on the freedom of protest is actually quite consistent with what we&#8217;ve seen his approach to be over the course of the last several years.&nbsp; But I think it&#8217;s an indication of exactly that.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which side requested this call between President Biden and President Xi tomorrow?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; It was discussed on the &#8212; during the call &#8212; during the meeting that our National Security Advisor had on Monday.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So are you saying it was mutually agreed upon?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; They mutually agreed to move forward with it during that meeting.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secretary Blinken just said that the U.S. is concerned China is considering directly assisting Russia by providing them with more military equipment to use in Ukraine.&nbsp; That is not something that we have heard from the administration before.&nbsp; And so, can I get you to speak to how high of a concern that is from the &#8212; for the White House right now?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; It is a high concern, a significant concern, given our Secretary of State just conveyed that.&nbsp; And certainly, our concerns about China assisting, in any way, Russia as they invade a foreign country is of significant concern and would &#8212; the response to that would be consequences.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before Russia invaded, the White House was pretty clear that if they did invade, there would be sanctions imposed on them as a result of that.&nbsp; With China, you&#8217;ve just said if they do help Russia, that there will be consequences, but you haven&#8217;t said specifically that they will be sanctions.&nbsp; Can you say, without saying what they are, that they will be sanctioned if they do help Russia with military equipment for this invasion?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I&#8217;m just not going to outline what the consequences would look like.&nbsp; And I &#8212; the President, obviously, will speak with President Xi tomorrow, and he&#8217;ll speak directly about that.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just on that point, just so I&#8217;m clear: I mean, I understand you don&#8217;t want to detail what the consequences could be, but the President in the phone call will make clear not just that there will be consequences but what those consequences could be to Xi?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll have more to read out after the call happens tomorrow.&nbsp; But we have not &#8212; our National Security Advisor, obviously, didn&#8217;t hold back in his conversation he had.&nbsp; Our Secretary of State did not hold back in his comments he just made publicly.&nbsp; And the President always takes the opportunity when he speaks with foreign leaders to be candid and direct.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You said the phone call is going to be an opportunity to assess where Xi stands. &nbsp;Should we take that to mean that it&#8217;s not clear that the Chinese have made up their mind whether or not to assist the Russians?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I think if you look at the last couple of weeks, Mary, you can see that they abstained from a vote in the U.N. Security Council, but they also &#8212; and they sp- &#8212; they had put out a comment during the Munich Security Conference defending the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, but they also echoed some of the conspiracy theories about chemical weapons and U.S. and Ukrainian intentions.<br><br>So, for any country, it&#8217;s a question of where you want to be as the history books are written.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And do you believe that this is a sign that &#8212; or can you characterize at all your understanding of how low the Russians may be running on some military equipment, given that they seem to be turning to China for some help?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I can&#8217;t provide an assessment on that from here.&nbsp; But, you know, I know my colleagues at the Department of Defense have conveyed clearly &#8212; and I&#8217;m happy to echo &#8212; that it&#8217;s not only not going as they planned; they have had challenges, obviously, with the operations of equipment, with the amount of equipment, even with MREs and food and other supplies.&nbsp; And, you know, that is what we have seen occur on the ground, but I don&#8217;t have a numerical summary from here.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.&nbsp; So, one of the clearest responses we have seen from the Chinese about their possibly helping Russia came from the Foreign Minister, Wang Yi, who told Spanish officials on a call, “China is not a party to the crisis, nor does it want the sanctions to affect China.”&nbsp; What sanctions are they talking about?&nbsp; Did Jake Sullivan specifically bring up the sanctions during the meeting in Rome?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I can&#8217;t speak to what he meant.&nbsp; You&#8217;d have to ask the Chinese.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Well, has the Chinese expressed the same thing to the U.S. &#8212; that they do not want to run the risk of being sanctioned?&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I would &#8212; the Chinese would speak for themselves.&nbsp; We typically don&#8217;t speak for others.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; So, just now, Secretary Blinken joined Ambassador Greenfield and the President in describing Putin’s actions as war crimes.&nbsp; I know that you said just yesterday that there is a legal process that is ongoing.&nbsp; How long does that process typically take?&nbsp; How much evidence do we need to collect?&nbsp; And can you clarify who will ultimately determine whether these are war crimes or not?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I think Secretary Blinken, in his remarks, also gave some specifics about who from the State Department will be leading that effort.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a legal process where they review all of the evidence, and then they provide that evidence and data and information to the international bodies that oversee the investigations.&nbsp; And the international bodies that oversee the investigations would make determinations about violation of international law and whether it&#8217;s war crimes by their standards and what the consequences would be.&nbsp;<br><br>So we would be supporting those efforts.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And do you know how long that usually takes?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; A legal process internally in the State Department?&nbsp; It can take some time.&nbsp; But again, I can&#8217;t &#8212; I would point to the State Department for any update they want to provide on the timeline.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; And one more on Jeff Zients.&nbsp; He and Dr. Ashish Jha, who&#8217;s going to replace him, have such very different backgrounds and different skillsets.&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Mm-hmm.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So what does that say about how the stage of the pandemic has evolved from then and now?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; Well, I would say: What it says is that Jeff Zient&#8217;s superpower is that he is an operational and managerial guru of sorts and someone who has taken those skills to a range of jobs he&#8217;s had throughout his career, including in the Obama-Biden administration when he oversaw the fixing of Healthcare.gov and oversaw the fixing of the technology that was severely broken and outdated within government at that time.&nbsp;<br><br>So, when we came into this administration &#8212; I would remind you it&#8217;s now a long time ago &#8212; there was no real plan.&nbsp; We were left no plan by our predecessors.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We needed to put in place a plan to not only get enough access to vaccines but also ensure there are enough vaccinators and vaccine locations.&nbsp; That&#8217;s a massive operational undertaking.<br><br>Right now, we&#8217;re at a point in the process where we have all of the tools and we know the operational systems that are needed.&nbsp; And so, right now, it&#8217;s the appropriate time.&nbsp; And Jeff, of course, made this decision on his own.&nbsp; He extended a couple of times to stay longer through some ups and downs in the pandemic.<br><br>We&#8217;re having a public health expert, somebody who&#8217;s as kno- &#8212; as well known as &#8212; Dr. Jha &#8212; is effective in communicating with the country about how we&#8217;re going to continue to approach and tackle the pandemic.&nbsp;<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; The President called Putin a “war criminal” yesterday.&nbsp; The Secretary of State just said that that was also his view today.&nbsp; So, given all of that, why are we still having Putin&#8217;s Russia broker the Iran nuclear deal talks?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would say that it&#8217;s not in our interest for Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon.&nbsp; And Russia is a member of the P5+1.&nbsp; So, that is the pursuit of a deal that would be in our national security interests.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, basically we’re just stuck working with him?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, again, I think how the President and any of the P5+1 partners or Europeans or others look at this is: If we can achieve a diplomatic solution where we prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon &#8212; despite the efforts by former President Trump to pull us out of the deal, allowing Iran to move far- &#8212; move closer to acquiring a nuclear weapon, that would be good for our national security and good for global security around the world.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act says that Congress is required to review any new agreement.&nbsp; This is obviously not the same agreement that Obama worked on in 2015.&nbsp; Does President Biden believe that this treaty needs the advice and consent of Congress?&nbsp; And if so, does he believe he has the votes to lawfully affirm it?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, if &#8212; if and when we have a deal &#8212; and we don&#8217;t have a deal at this point; otherwise, you would all know &#8212; we would carefully consider the facts and circumstances of any U.S. return to the JCPOA to determine the legal implications, including those under the Iran Nuclear Review Act of 2015.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re committed to ensuring the requirements are satisfied.&nbsp; So, certainly, we would abide by that.<br><br>But we have been keeping members very updated.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve been briefing them regularly.&nbsp; Brett McGurk conducted a call just a couple days ago.&nbsp; And we&#8217;ve been briefing them with a range of national security officials.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, has the IGRC &#8212; or &#8212; done any &#8212; or rather, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, the IRGC &#8212; has it done anything to be eligible to be removed from the terror blacklist?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I think you&#8217;re asking me this because it&#8217;s been out there as a possible discussion, but there&#8217;s no deal at this point.&nbsp; So, if and when there&#8217;s a deal, we&#8217;ll have a discussion about what&#8217;s in the deal.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Outside of the deal, though, does it take action to be removed from that terror blacklist?&nbsp; Do you have to do something to get off of it?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; You have to make a decision, yes.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; I want to ask you a slightly different version of a question that I asked you yesterday &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; about the $800 million military assistance.&nbsp; I asked if you could tell us how quickly it would arrive.&nbsp; And I understand this is a complicated process.&nbsp; To flip it around a little bit, can you tell us how quickly will the first shipment be out the door?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, we&#8217;ve been doing shipments or deliveries every day or every couple of days.&nbsp; And obviously, the Department of Defense would have more specifics.&nbsp;<br><br>But we have effectively and successfully delivered $300 million in military assistance to the Ukrainians on the ground over just the last two weeks.&nbsp; And our effort would be to continue to rapidly provide infor- &#8212;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And of this &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; &#8212; provide equipment.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; of this new tranche, this new $800 million announcement, can you give us &#8212; just characterize how quickly this round will start to be sent (inaudible)?&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, the operations of that would be led by the Department of Defense, so I would point you to them for more operational specifics.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And to stay on the Department of Defense &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; the Defense Secretary was speaking with his Slovakian counterpart who said that they were willing to send long-range S-300 surface-to-air missiles if the U.S. would backfill.&nbsp; Does the administration see this as a done deal, as something that is imminent, that would happen?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, it&#8217;s the decision of any foreign country, as a sovereign country, to decide what equipment they want to provide.&nbsp; What we are mindful of is ensuring that we are maintaining &#8212; we have to be careful in our desire to support other countries, that we&#8217;re not inadvertently impacting NATO readiness or capabilities or our own.<br><br>And again, this is something the Department of Defense can most effectively speak to, but a lot of these military systems would &#8212; some of them require months to manufacture or to build.&nbsp; We just don&#8217;t &#8212; we don&#8217;t have a warehouse of just military equipment that&#8217;s ready to typically be sent all the time.&nbsp; So, that is a factor.&nbsp;<br><br>But we want to find a solution that both enables Allies and partners to provide the support they have available to Ukraine, while addressing the very real need to backfill their defense systems, which is often a significant challenge.&nbsp;<br><br>And we just want to make sure that if and when our Allies are donating material, including us, they&#8217;re not leaving a gap in their own defenses.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; And just, finally, Ukrainian refugees are being turned away at the southern border &#8212; I know you’ve gotten some questions about this &#8212; because of Title 42, obviously put in place in the early days of COVID-19.&nbsp; Where is the administration in trying to work around this?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, right now, as I noted I think the other day, there are discussions about any ways we could be helpful in welcoming refugees into the United States, something the President &#8212; Ukrainian refugees, of course &#8212; we welcome many refugees, as you know &#8212; something the President is willing, of course; happy to do.<br><br>The role we&#8217;ve been playing to date, Kristen, has been really providing humanitarian assistance.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve provided $300 million in humanitarian assistance to the people in Ukraine and neighboring countries.&nbsp; A lot of that is going to help provide support to refugees.&nbsp; Three million in three weeks, which is a startling number, that are going to neighboring countries.&nbsp;<br><br>And the bipartisan funding bill the President just signed a couple of days ago provides more than $4 billion in humanitarian assistance, including $2.65 billion through the USAID International Disaster Assistance program, which provides everything from food, healthcare, other urgent support, and $1.4 billion for migration and refugee assistance to support refugees fleeing Ukraine.<br><br>But that is where &#8212; because the vast, vast majority of refugees want to stay in neighboring countries, that is where we have been focusing our energies at this point.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The President has been clear that he welcomes those who do want to come here.&nbsp; But given this law, it &#8212; are there discussions about revoking Title 42?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; The revocation of Title 42 wouldn&#8217;t be done in response to a war in a European country.&nbsp; It&#8217;s done by a decision &#8212; would be made by the CDC, and then it would be implemented when that is done.&nbsp; And it will be done, at some point, of course, with the interagency, including the Department of Homeland Security.&nbsp;<br><br>But, you know, there is a range of discussions about if there are ways for Ukrainian refugees to come.&nbsp; Right now, they&#8217;d have to apply, obviously, through existing refugee programs where they would apply from a third country.&nbsp;<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; Given the COVID surge in China and the lockdowns that we&#8217;re seeing there, is supply chain issues and, you know, those getting worse, perhaps, going to be part of the call tomorrow at all, or is it focused on &#8212; mostly on Russia?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; It will be focused on a range of issues.&nbsp; Certainly Russia and Ukraine &#8212; Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine will be a part of that, but our economic relationship with China, a range of issues of mutual concern will certainly be a discussion.&nbsp;<br><br>So, I don&#8217;t &#8212; I will &#8212; we will have more to read out for you once the &#8212; once the meeting concludes tomorrow.<br><br>And this is, of course, an issue that we are watching very closely.&nbsp; While the ports, I believe, still remain open, one of the challenges we&#8217;ve seen on the ground and we are tracking very closely is the number of manufacturing facilities or the number of workers who are not working.&nbsp; Sometimes there&#8217;s a lag in what that impact can be in terms of the production of materials and how that impacts the supply chain.&nbsp; So, we are tracking that very closely.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>But again, I expect this to be a wide-ranging conversation tomorrow.&nbsp; And we&#8217;ll have more to read out once it&#8217;s concluded.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, just to follow up on the President being around some people who’ve &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; now tested positive, why not just test the President every day at this point?&nbsp; The administration has done a lot in terms of, you know, saying certain actions are being done out of an abundance of caution.&nbsp; So, in this case, even if it doesn&#8217;t quite follow CDC guidelines or goes above and beyond, why not just do that because he&#8217;s the President?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Because we&#8217;re guided by his medical doctor, and he has kept him at the same cadence.&nbsp; And if that changes, then we will change how often he&#8217;s tested.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And is the cadence once a week?&nbsp; Or &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Go ahead.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; Questions on a couple of different topics.&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To try this a different way: Does the President have specific things he wants to accomplish in tomorrow’s conversation with President Xi?&nbsp; Are there specific deliverables he&#8217;s hoping to get out of it?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, this is, again, an opportunity for him to speak directly, leader to leader, about a range of issues.&nbsp; Of course, the invasion of Russia &#8212; Russia inva- &#8212; Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine will be a part of that, and what role or how &#8212; how President Xi sees the role of China in that conflict will be a part of that.&nbsp;<br><br>There&#8217;s also a range of other topics that they will discuss.&nbsp; But I&#8217;m purposely leaving some space for the President to have a direct conversation with his counterpart.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, on the COVID cases that &#8212; for example, with the Second Gentleman testing positive this week, why did the Vice President appear today &#8212; I understand she was masked &#8212; but in an event with other people around, when CDC guidance is currently that people who have been exposed should stay home and not interact with others for five days?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, she is fully boosted.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t actually believe that&#8217;s an accurate description of CDC guidance of having a close contact.&nbsp; We, obviously, all have had close contacts here.&nbsp;&nbsp; And you&#8217;re tested at a regular cadence.&nbsp; And she is abiding by that.&nbsp;<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; Just to kind of follow up on that<br>bit on COVID: Is one of the reasons why the administration is not going &#8212; being extra cautious with the President and the Vice President, even though there is national security issue around this, in part to kind of lead by example for Americans to say, “You can get back to living your normal lives, and you shouldn&#8217;t be concerned that even if you get exposed to somebody just briefly, you shouldn&#8217;t freak out about that.&nbsp; You don&#8217;t need to test a bunch of times”?&nbsp; Is that basically the dynamic that you&#8217;re trying to say &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp;&nbsp; Look &#8212; oh, go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; even though if the President &#8212; 79 years old &#8212; the President of the United States were to get COVID, it might be more serious than, you know, somebody in their twenties?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, we don&#8217;t know that.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right.&nbsp; We don’t.&nbsp; But (inaudible).<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; But we also know that COVID impacts people of all ages and a range of &#8212; but we take &#8212; what we do here, Jen, is not &#8212; not exactly as you said.&nbsp; So I wouldn&#8217;t agree with your description there.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>I would say we do take extra precautions, including individuals who are around the President being tested &#8212; that goes over and above, of course.&nbsp; He is the President of the United States, so we do take those additional steps.&nbsp; And we, of course, abide by what the recommendations and advice are of his medical doctor.&nbsp; And if that would be to do increased testing, we would certainly do that.&nbsp; But he does not feel that that is necessary at this point in time based on these recent contacts.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also wanted to ask about oil and gas companies and &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There&#8217;s been some reports, from the fourth quarter, of them increasing their stock buybacks.&nbsp; There was already, you know, a time when there was a spike in gas prices last year, I think in the fourth quarter.&nbsp; And you&#8217;re also just seeing the companies saying that they&#8217;re kind of reluctant to up production.&nbsp; And they kind of, in some ways, point to the administration&#8217;s policies overall in the sense that even if they were to up production, that, one, it takes months to get to market; and two, it doesn&#8217;t fit in with the overall approach that this administration is taking.&nbsp; So what do you say to that kind of viewpoint?&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I think it&#8217;s hard for them to make the argument it&#8217;s anything other than business decisions on their part, and they have said that themselves.&nbsp;<br><br>The CEO of Occidental Petroleum said, quote, “We have no need and no intent to invest in production growth this year.”<br><br>The CEO of Marathon Oil said, quote, “Our cash flow-driven return of capital framework uniquely prioritizes our shareholders as the first call on cash flow generation, not the drill bit.”<br><br>The CEO of Pioneer Natural Resources said, quote, “We&#8217;re not going to change our growth rate.”&nbsp; “We think it&#8217;s important to return cash back to shareholders.”&nbsp; That&#8217;s a business decision.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>The oil and gas industry right now is receiving profit &#8212; windfall profits; we&#8217;ve seen that.&nbsp; They publicly report their profits.&nbsp; They publicly report this information.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>And instead of keeping up with current demand, too many of these companies, in our view, are making the calculated decision of returning money to investors and shareholders through buybacks and dividends, instead of expanding production enough in the short term, which is what we need.&nbsp;<br><br>Again, it&#8217;s a business decision, but I think there&#8217;s clear evidence of them acknowledging and even shouting that out.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, I have a China question and, with full awareness of the news cycle, a St. Patrick’s Day question.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Oh, okay.&nbsp; All right.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; China question first.&nbsp; About a week ago, you said that for everything else, by and large, the White House saw China as still abiding by international sanctions.&nbsp; But on Russia, does that view still hold a week later?&nbsp; Is that generally how the White House views China?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have a new assessment of that.&nbsp; We&#8217;re obviously watching very closely.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; St. Patrick&#8217;s Day.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yes.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Given the fact that the President very much likes to share his pride of the Iri- &#8212; his Irish heritage but also the fact that &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; He does.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; so many ceremonial&#8211;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; “More Irish than Irish.”&nbsp; Is that what he said?&nbsp; “Irish Americans consider themselves more Irish.”&nbsp; I think that&#8217;s true.&nbsp; I will confirm that.&nbsp;<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But like that, and also the fact that so many of the ceremonial parts of the job &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; have been canceled over the past year, I&#8217;m wondering: Did he express particular frustration or sadness that the Oval meeting had to become yet another Zoom meeting today?&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; He was disappointed.&nbsp; He was looking forward to having the meeting today.&nbsp; And having meetings over Zoom, I think as we&#8217;ve all experienced, are not the same.&nbsp; Having spent a lot of time with the President, he is an extrovert, extrovert, extrovert and loves that engagement with people in person.&nbsp; And he was really looking forward to the meeting today.&nbsp;<br><br>There will be more in the future.&nbsp; We certainly understand we are still facing the pandemic.&nbsp; And there are more events that he has been able to participate in today to celebrate St. Patrick&#8217;s Day.&nbsp; So, fortunately, many of them still moved forward.&nbsp;<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; Yesterday, in his remarks to the Congress, President Zelenskyy called for the creation of this new global organization that he called “U-24. United for Peace,” described as an alliance that would supply assistance, including weapons, within 24 hours.&nbsp; I was wondering if the administration has a view on that idea.&nbsp; Is it something that you guys are discussing with Ukraine?&nbsp; And does the U.S. view this as Zelenskyy’s, kind of, alternative for Ukraine entering NATO?&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would say, just to reiterate, it&#8217;s up to NATO to determine who enters NATO.&nbsp; And obviously, any country, we would support their aspiration to join NATO should they choose and they meet the requirements.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>We, of course, did see him convey that in the speech.&nbsp; We don&#8217;t have more details.&nbsp; We are very closely engaged with the Ukrainians and speak with them every day.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Beyond that, I would say: In terms of the delivery of weapons, we do it as quickly as we humanly possibly can through our system and in coordination with our NATO partners and Allies.&nbsp; But we know &#8212; we support a range of ideas being put out there.&nbsp; We&#8217;ll discuss it with the Europeans and others and see if there&#8217;s more to report out from there.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also wanted to try one more time on &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; on the President and COVID.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Okay.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A lot of the questions are focused on testing, which you&#8217;re pretty clear that the testing cadence is not changing.&nbsp; As he looks particularly to a trip next week that is quite important &#8212; to Brussels and maybe elsewhere in Europe &#8212; is there anything else that he&#8217;s doing, I mean, as he&#8217;s having these &#8212; what the CDC does not consider a close contact but are certain people that he&#8217;s around and aware of &#8212; is anything about his behavior changing?&nbsp; Are there any other precautions that you guys are taking that are not testing-related?&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We have continued to take the same testing protocol &#8212; steps which are significant and go farther than CDC guidance goes.&nbsp; But beyond that, the te- &#8212; his testing cadence remains the same, and there haven&#8217;t been additional changes to our internal protocols.&nbsp;<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey.&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; The Kremlin responded to President Biden labeling Putin a “war criminal” yesterday by calling his remarks “unacceptable and unforgivable.”&nbsp; What is the White House&#8217;s reaction to getting criticism from Russia about the President&#8217;s remarks?&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; It&#8217;s pretty rich coming from a country where &#8212; whose actions are unforgivable in the eyes of the world &#8212; global community.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Given that there&#8217;s an ongoing legal process and investigation by the State Department into whether there was, in fact, war crimes committed, what is the purpose of the President and now Secretary of State getting ahead of that investigation?<br><br>I know you said &#8212; or the Pr- &#8212; you said yesterday that the President was speaking from his heart.&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is that what this is &#8212; just speaking from their heart?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I think Secretary Blinken was as well.&nbsp; And as you heard Secretary Blinken convey in his remarks, what we&#8217;re seeing &#8212; whether it is the destruction of a theater, where the words “children” or “kids” was written in Russian outside of the theater, according to photos; or whether it is the, you know, targeting of civilians, of hospitals, of maternity wards &#8212; if that&#8217;s not considered a war crime by human beings, what is?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>And there is a legal process that is important to continue that we have at the State Department that is ongoing, that Secretary Blinken spoke about.&nbsp; And any of that information and data we gather would go to the international bodies that would have prosecuted war criminals in the past.&nbsp; That&#8217;s where that information would go.&nbsp; It wouldn&#8217;t be the United States doing that; it&#8217;s the international bodies that do that.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>So, we will continue to feed information into that.&nbsp;&nbsp;But, you know, I think it&#8217;s important to call out what we see happening on the ground, and I think that&#8217;s exactly what the President and the Secretary did.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even though it would go to those international bodies, would the U.S. have a response if that investigation does conclude that there were war crimes?&nbsp; Would &#8212;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, typically, it&#8217;s an international response and it goes through these international systems for a reason.&nbsp; So we will continue to provide data and information to that process.<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, if I can have one more question on behalf of a colleague?&nbsp; There are growing calls from civil rights advocates and some lawmakers to pass Temporary Protected Status for Cameroon.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some have alleged a double standard in how the administration prioritizes pretominant [sic] &#8212; predominantly Black and brown countries when it comes to immigration.&nbsp; For example, it took seven months to grant TPS status for Afghanistan, but only took about a week to grant TPS to Ukraine.&nbsp; Is TPS for Cameroon something the administration is considering and looking at?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I’d point you to the Department of Homeland Security, who oversees that process.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; This morning, Senator Mitch McConnell was talking about Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson on the Senate floor, and he was specifically talking about how some of her supporters have framed her experience as a public defender.&nbsp; He said, quote, “If any judicial nominee…does have special empathy for some parties over others, that&#8217;s not an asset.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a problem.”&nbsp; He also said the President is “deliberately working to make the whole federal judiciary softer on crime.”&nbsp; Do you have a response to that?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; He also said he expected her to get confirmed with some Republican votes.<br><br>What I would say, though &#8212; because there are others in the Senate who have made faulty accusations about Judge Ketanji&nbsp; Brown Jackson&#8217;s record and specifically about her record on child sex crimes, so let me just take the opportunity to clear that up &#8212; not that most people have confusion about it.&nbsp;<br><br>But in the vast majority of cases involving child sex crimes, the sentences Judge Jackson imposed were consistent with or above what the government or U.S. probation recommended.&nbsp; For example, there are &#8212; there are arguments that have been made out there by Senator Hawley and others that &#8212; where he took a snippet of a transcript out of context, when, in fact, Judge Jackson was repeating something a witness said in order to ask a question about their testimony.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>So some who are accusing her of being, quote, “soft on crime” also failed to note that what was omitted is a sentencing commission report that&#8217;s been touted out there, was unanimously supported by a bipartisan Sentencing Commission.<br><br>She comes from a law enforcement family, has devoted her career to standing up for the rule of law, which is why she is endorsed by so many leading law enforcement organizations in the country.&nbsp; And attempts to smear or discredit her history and her work are not borne out in facts.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know Monday is a long ways away, given the news cycle &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; It&#8217;s all relative.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; Will the President stop at around 11:00 to watch the beginning of the hearing up on Capitol Hill?&nbsp; And will his schedule be adjusted around that?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know what his schedule is yet.&nbsp; I&#8217;m certain that he will catch coverage or catch some of her hearings over the course of next week.&nbsp; But I don&#8217;t know what his schedule looks like yet for Monday.&nbsp;<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; I have two questions.&nbsp; You have already announced President Biden’s trip to Europe, to Brussels.&nbsp; But there were also reports about a possible trip to Poland.&nbsp; Can you confirm that such a trip is under consideration?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have any more details about his trip to announce at this point in time.&nbsp; As we have them, we will announce them all to you.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One more.&nbsp; There are negotiations ongoing between Ukraine and Russia.&nbsp; Does the White House support those negotiations?&nbsp; And what &#8212; what&#8217;s &#8212; how can you describe your involvement &#8212; the U.S. involvement in those talks between Russia and Ukraine?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, we&#8217;ve been involved in a couple of ways.&nbsp; One, we&#8217;ve been leading the effort to build support in the global community to put in place sanctions that are crippling the Russian economy, to provide military support and economic support to the Ukrainians that strengthen their hand as they participate in these discussions and negotiations.&nbsp; And we also engage every day with Ukrainians to discuss.<br><br>Obviously, I would note that, as you know, our National Security Advisor also talked to his counterpart yesterday as well.&nbsp; But we are continuing to support the Ukrainians’ efforts.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>What our concern is, though, is &#8212; you know, these diplomatic talks &#8212; as they&#8217;re ongoing, we have seen no effort, no movement, no evidence that President Putin and the Russians are de-escalating.&nbsp; And that is really what we are going to continue to closely watch.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A follow-up on your point about Senator Hawley.&nbsp; Obviously, he&#8217;s consistently voted against the President&#8217;s nominees.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t think he was a swing vote you guys were counting on.&nbsp; However, will his criticism, will the explosiveness of this line of attack &#8212; do you worry that it will affect your ability to win over other Republican votes?&nbsp; Is there any concern about this campaign upping the pressure on, say, Senators Collins and Murkowski, who may be more amenable to voting for (inaudible)?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I&#8217;m not sure that someone who refused to tell people whether or not he would vote for Roy Moore is an effective and credible messenger on this.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; I&#8217;m going to try again on President Biden and President Xi&#8217;s call tomorrow.&nbsp; If you won&#8217;t detail the consequences of what happens if China does start supporting &#8212; more support Russia, might you indicate whether there are any carrots that the administration has prepared to offer, perhaps tariff reductions?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, this is a conversation about where President Xi stands.&nbsp; It&#8217;s up to the Chinese to decide where they want to stand, where they want to be as the history books are written.&nbsp; So I think it&#8217;s more through that frame than it is about carrots.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; And then just one more &#8212; two more, actually.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the administration continues to condemn and take action against Russia&#8217;s invasion on Ukraine, are there any plans to revisit, review, revoke the Trump administration&#8217;s recognition of Israel&#8217;s annexation on the Golan Heights and Morocco&#8217;s annexation of Western Sahara?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have any updates on that front.&nbsp; I&#8217;d point to the State Department.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But at this point, can you &#8212; can you describe just the administration&#8217;s position on the difference between Russia&#8217;s invasion on Ukraine and Israel&#8217;s annexation of the Golan Heights?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I’d point you to the State Department.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; And then one more.&nbsp; One more logistical question.&nbsp; Cambodia, the chair of ASEAN, has announced last week that the U.S.-ASEAN summit that the President is supposed to host on the 28th, I believe, is postponed.&nbsp; We haven&#8217;t been able to get a confirmation from either you guys or State.&nbsp; Can you clarify on that?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have any updates on the schedule.&nbsp; I know we were working through the schedules of a number of leaders, so that&#8217;s always a challenge and a factor.&nbsp; But I don&#8217;t have any updates.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So it’s still on the table?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have any updates on it.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.&nbsp; Two on COVID.&nbsp; There are some Americans who have received a second booster &#8212; i.e., for a fourth total shot.&nbsp; Is that something that the President has done or will do?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; He has not done that.&nbsp; If the CDC recommends it, he would get another booster.&nbsp; They have not.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, secondly, the White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain, in a tweet today, celebrated the idea that &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Uh-oh.&nbsp; (Laughter.)<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You know who he is &#8212; said &#8212; and that he tweets.&nbsp; You said &#8212; he said &#8212; celebrated the idea that there is a low number of Americans in ICUs today because of COVID.&nbsp; But he also wrote, quote, there&#8217;s a “great risk of a new wave.”&nbsp; And there are &#8212; certainly, we&#8217;re seeing cases surge right now in China and in Europe.&nbsp; And one of the truisms of this pandemic: If it&#8217;s in Europe, it ends up here a few weeks later.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What precautions and preparations is the administration taking federally and encouraging states to take ahead of a possible new COVID wave?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; So, what we have seen &#8212; and I think you&#8217;re talking about the BA.2 variant &#8212; and we are closely watching and monitoring the situation both in Europe and in China &#8212; BA.2 is a more transmissible version of Omicron.&nbsp; But we do know the tools the United States has &#8212; including the mRNA vaccines, therapeutics, and tests &#8212; all are effective tools against this variant.<br><br>And China has not used mRNA vaccines, which is an important component of how we&#8217;re seeing the response there &#8212; or how it&#8217;s impacting people there.&nbsp; But BA.2 has been circulating a little different from Omicron, when we were going through that surge in November.&nbsp; It has been circulating here for some time.&nbsp; We currently &#8212; it may be higher than this, but as of earlier this week, there were about 35,000 cases in this country.&nbsp; And we expect some fluctuation, especially at this relatively low level.<br><br>But this is an example of where the President&#8217;s Preparedness Plan that we rolled out just a couple of weeks ago, which lays out what the tools are that we need to move forward safely, is important.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>And what we&#8217;ve been conveying to governors, to go to your question, or leaders around the country and certainly members of Congress, is that just because COVID isn&#8217;t disrupting some of our lives in certain communities as much as it was a few weeks ago, it doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s gone; it&#8217;s not gone.&nbsp; And I think this variant is an example of that.<br><br>We do know what we need to manage it.&nbsp; But we are also at great risk of running out of money to do exactly that.&nbsp; And so that is a key part of what we&#8217;re communicating to governors, to members of Congress, and others about where we are with funding and the need to end some of these programs soon if we don&#8217;t get the funding we need.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just a very short, quick follow-up.&nbsp; Is there concern, though, that this variant, which is more &#8212; it seems very transmissible &#8212; is coming at a moment when a lot of Americans are seeing waning protection from their boosters just because the timing of the shots, as well as the fact that mask guidelines and other restrict- &#8212; regulations have been lifted across the country?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; It&#8217;s a good question.&nbsp; I would point to our medical experts to answer that.&nbsp; I mean, it is more transmissible, but we know it can be treated.&nbsp; So I think what it is &#8212; is a reminder of is that while it has decreased in many parts of the country, it is not gone, and it means we still need to continue to take steps we can to fight the virus.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Japan hosts the largest number of U.S. military, about 50,000 troops, about a half a million Americans at any given time in Japan.&nbsp; And many Japanese remember, at that time, Vice President Biden came all the way to Japan about 10 years ago when there was a terrible disaster, but there&#8217;s been no interview with any Japanese media.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Oh.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you think we could arrange that?&nbsp; Just to assure them that the treaty is enforced.&nbsp; Especially the Senkaku, the southern islands, they&#8217;re very worried about &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; The President does have &#8212;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Could we get a positive &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; He does have a great deal of affection for Japan and has spoken, of course, with their &#8212; the current leader a couple of times.&nbsp; I&#8217;m happy to take your interview requests under &#8212; under advisement.&nbsp;<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; I wanted to ask you about the refugee situation in Ukraine.&nbsp; Does the White House see the refugee situation that was created in Afghanistan last year as different than the one created by Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>And the reason I say that is &#8212; is your policy response different?&nbsp; I hear you say that your understanding is that neighboring countries &#8212; that&#8217;s where people are going from Ukraine right now and not necessarily coming here.&nbsp; But, at some point, is that going to not be an option anymore?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, it&#8217;s different, in part, for the reason you mentioned.&nbsp; That &#8212; in Ukraine, there are &#8212; while there have been 3 million refugees or about that number over the last couple of weeks, they have been &#8212;&nbsp;the vast, vast majority of them have moved into countries &#8212; neighboring countries who have set up really remarkable systems for welcoming these refugees at a really challenging and difficult time.&nbsp;<br><br>I know there&#8217;s been a lot of reporting from a lot of your networks in Poland and other places where they have had systems in place to welcome refugees.&nbsp; That has been the preference of a &#8212; of these refugees.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why we have been providing our humanitarian assistance to these countries and to Ukraine directly, in order to help augment the support in &#8212; in the best way possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Every refugee circumstance is different and has different needs and requirements.&nbsp; And we try to adapt our own response from USAID or from our refugee and migration programming and funding to meet what the needs are in that conflict.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also wanted to ask, on a completely different topic: The President, in the State of the Union, said that he would sign an executive order on identity theft.&nbsp; And I think he called it &#8220;pandemic aid fraud&#8221; or something similar.&nbsp; Do you have an update on where that is?&nbsp; I know it hasn&#8217;t been published yet.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, let&#8217;s see.&nbsp; What we know at this point in time is that &#8212; I mean, he talked about addressing unemployment fraud &#8212; right? &#8212; through the pandemic.&nbsp; And so, what we&#8217;re doing now is ensuring that we&#8217;re taking steps toward that.<br><br>Last week, the Department of Justice announced a new chief pandemic prosecutor.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re working to escalate efforts to crack down on bad actors and support and augment that.&nbsp; But in terms of the executive order, I don&#8217;t have an update on the timeline on it.&nbsp;<br><br>Go ahead in the back.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, two questions: one foreign policy, one domestic.&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; I like the setup.&nbsp; (Laughter.)<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Inaudible.)<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So are you &#8212; what do you make of the fact that there now appear to be Chechen and maybe Syrian regular forces fighting on behalf of Russia in Ukraine?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have any confirmation of that from here.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, on the domestic front, Kathy Hochul, the governor of New York, proposed today making changes to the state&#8217;s progressive bail reform law.&nbsp; And it looks like Mayor Adams, who I think we can describe as an ally of the President, would support those changes.&nbsp; So does this administration stand by it&#8217;s &#8212; what I would describe as a “wholesale endorsement” of bail reform?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I would have to check on the specifics of the New York changes.&nbsp; I haven&#8217;t looked into those.&nbsp; I&#8217;m happy to do that and talk to our Counsel&#8217;s Office about that, and we&#8217;ll get back to you.&nbsp;<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So the Chinese have been very public about how they&#8217;re going to continue their normal economic activity with Russia.&nbsp; Is the President going to press President Xi on that?&nbsp; And is he going to ask them to sort of back off their activity like the rest of the world?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I think that the conversation tomorrow will be a continuation of the conversation our National Security Advisor had with his counterpart earlier this week.&nbsp; And certainly, China&#8217;s alignment with Russia, in a range of ways, is and the potential implications and consequences of that are a central part of that conversation.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, domestically, on another subject, the Congressional Progressive Caucus Recommendations for Executive Action are out, and they&#8217;re asking for a decision to declare a climate emergency and ban all U.S. exports of oil.&nbsp; Is that something that President is thinking about doing (inaudible)?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; There are a range of really good ideas out there.&nbsp; The President is looking at all of them.&nbsp; But I don&#8217;t have anything to predict for you at this point in time.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One last quick one to start for the room: When is the President going to nominate a new Fed nominee?&nbsp; (Laughter.)<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would say that one of the most eminently qualified people ever to be nominated only withdrew her nomination, I think, 48 hours ago, 72 hours ago; it&#8217;s all running together.&nbsp;<br><br>He very much intends to nominate another eminently qualified person, but I don&#8217;t have an update on the timeline of that.&nbsp; Let the financial wires games begin.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.&nbsp; If the U.S. plans to still engage with Russia on the Iran nuclear deal and perhaps some of these other climate initiatives, what does President Biden expect Russia to bring to the table?&nbsp; I know what the goal is &#8212; that we don&#8217;t want Iran to have a nuclear weapon &#8212; but how does the President think that Putin will be helpful after the President rightfully turns him into a pariah on the global stage?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; As it relates to the Iran nuclear deal?&nbsp; I think that our view on this is that it&#8217;s not, obviously, in our interest and it&#8217;s not in Russia&#8217;s interests either for Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon.&nbsp;<br><br>And so, while these negotiations &#8212; I mean, the people are back in their capitals at this point in time, as you know, but they&#8217;re, for all intensive purposes, ongoing.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>There have been roles and implementation that Russia has had in the past.&nbsp; But I think what we recognize is that it&#8217;s not in their interest either.&nbsp; And we will consider &#8212; continue pursuing the diplomatic path forward.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then one more.&nbsp; The New York Times has authenticated emails that appear to have come from a laptop abandoned by Hunter Biden in Delaware.&nbsp; The President previously said that the New York Post story about this was &#8220;a bunch of garbage&#8221; and that it was &#8220;a Russian plant.&#8221;&nbsp; Does he stand by that assessment?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I&#8217;d point you to the Department of Justice and also to Hunter Biden&#8217;s representatives.&nbsp; He doesn&#8217;t work in the government.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.&nbsp; So, there are the recent peace talks going on between Ukraine, Russia, as was already mentioned.&nbsp; It seems that a couple of the things that are being floated &#8212; one, some sort of withdrawal by Russia, but they still hold on to these pieces of Ukraine they already have in the east and Crimea.&nbsp;<br><br>So, my first question is: Would the U.S. ever back that kind of deal if it&#8217;s something that Ukrainians agreed or felt they had to agree to?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We&#8217;re here to support the Ukrainians, but we&#8217;re not going to negotiate about a negotiation that has not &#8212; has not resulted in even the implementation of humanitarian corridors at this point.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fair enough.&nbsp; But the other thing that&#8217;s been floated by Zelenskyy himself is that &#8212; he basically said the other day, “Ukrainians, get used to that we’re not going to be in NATO,&nbsp;they&#8217;re never going to want us.”<br><br>But then, he said, “What we would like is some kind of other security guarantees.”&nbsp; Is that something that you&#8217;re talking about to them?&nbsp; And what on Earth would that look like &#8212; &#8220;security guarantees&#8221;?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; It&#8217;s a de- &#8212; it&#8217;s a decision for President Zelenskyy and Ukrainians to make if they&#8217;re going to pursue membership in NATO, a decision for NATO to make if they&#8217;re going to be members, including &#8212; in terms of other security guarantees, we&#8217;re in touch regularly with them but I don&#8217;t have more information of what that would look like.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Couldn&#8217;t &#8212; the President isn&#8217;t talking about some kind of long-term new mechanism where the U.S. somehow or Western countries or Europe somehow protect &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I think that&#8217;s a little premature at this point in time.&nbsp;<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I may, on &#8212; back to the weapons package.&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Up until now, the administration has been really very tight lipped about what was being sent to Ukraine.&nbsp; Yesterday, that all changed.&nbsp; We got a whole laundry list.&nbsp; Is that a change in strategy, in messaging?&nbsp; Is that a message for &#8212; you talked before about the Russian troop morale, for example, or maybe a message to domestic critics of President Biden?&nbsp; What&#8217;s changed there?&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, we made a decision that we wanted to be very clear about what types of security assistance we&#8217;re providing and how it is helping Ukrainians fight the Russian &#8212; Russia&#8217;s war against them.&nbsp;<br><br>And so, yes, you could say that was a change &#8212; a decision to make that information available.&nbsp; And we don&#8217;t typically, to your point, outline all of those specifics publicly.&nbsp;<br><br>So &#8212; but we did determine &#8212; made a determination to do that because we felt it was important for all of you and the American public to fully understand the range of military and security assistance we&#8217;re providing, how it&#8217;s working, and how it&#8217;s helping them in this war.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But was Russian morale a factor in that sort of decision?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; It was not, but it was more a decision about recognizing that everybody doesn&#8217;t always understand what many people in this room do when we say “security assistance” what that is and how it helps the Ukrainians fight this war.&nbsp;<br><br>And there is an understandable outpour of support, of compassion for the plight of the Ukrainian people.&nbsp; And we want to provide as much detail as we can about how we&#8217;re trying to help them in this war.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And if I may, you were asked about Hunter Biden&#8217;s laptop.&nbsp; You also, in October 2020, dismissed it as &#8220;Russian disinformation.&#8221;&nbsp; Do you stand by that assessment?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Again, I&#8217;d point to the Department of Justice and Hunter Biden&#8217;s representatives.&nbsp; I&#8217;m a spokesperson for the United States; he doesn&#8217;t work for the United States.&nbsp;<br><br>Go ahead.&nbsp; Go ahead in &#8212; okay, we&#8217;ll do the last one here.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.&nbsp; I have two questions: one on North Korea and China.&nbsp; North Korea fired new missiles the day before yesterday.&nbsp; What is the &#8212; President Biden&#8217;s reaction on this?&nbsp; And how do you analyze the type of missiles?<br><br>I have a follow-up &#8212; second question.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, we condemn North Korea&#8217;s missile launches.&nbsp; North Korea&#8217;s tests risk raising tensions and are destabilizing to the Indo-Pacific.&nbsp; Our commitment to the defense of the Republic of Korea and Japan remains ironclad.&nbsp;<br><br>As we have said and North Korean officials, including Kim Jong Un, have publicly noted, we continue to seek diplomacy and are prepared to meet without preconditions.&nbsp; But North Korea continues to not respond.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; When the &#8212; President Biden talks with Xi Jinping, the President of China, tomorrow, do &#8212; he are going to discuss with President Xi Jinping regarding on North Korea&#8217;s missile provocations?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I expect there&#8217;ll be a range of topics discussed, including security in the region, but we&#8217;ll have more to read out when that conversation continu- &#8212; is done.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Thanks, everyone.&nbsp; See you tomorrow.<br><br>3:49 P.M. EDT</p>

<p>Thank you! It’s my pleasure to welcome all of you—so many good friends—to the White House!<br><br>And we are pleased to welcome the Taoiseach of Ireland, Micheál Martin, and his wife Mary, as well as the Irish Delegation, to Washington, D.C.<br><br>To love Joe Biden is to know Ireland. Picture me on our first few dates, dressed in bell bottoms and a peasant shirt. <br><br>I wore my hair down to my waist—and at the time, so did most of the men I dated. <br><br>And then there was this Senator, handsome and buttoned up in his suit and loafers—casually quoting Yeats.<br><br>It was the last thing I expected—but in the end, he won me over. <br><br>It doesn’t matter when Joe’s ancestors left—a piece of that island was passed down to each generation in memories, and stories, and family lore, held close like a precious gem—an emerald heart that shines like the light after a storm.<br><br>It’s a loyalty that knows “family” means forever.<br><br>A faith—tried and tested by famine and war.<br><br>An optimism brave enough to leave the life you know behind, and find what’s waiting on distant shores.<br><br>He’s not alone, of course. <br><br>Like so many generations of immigrants, Irish Americans brought the best of their home with them on wind and steam ships so many years ago. <br><br>Ridiculed and despised, they found ways to create new traditions, while never letting go of the legacies that made them, enriching our country along the way.<br><br>So it’s fitting that we honor that heritage by celebrating Saint Patrick, a man who brought faith to Ireland, enriching it, too. <br><br>There has always been a divine spark in the open arms of welcome. <br><br>Yes, I got to know Ireland through the eyes of Joe Biden. <br><br>On St. Patrick’s Day, all Americans, no matter their background, fall in love with it too.<br><br>We reach for a legacy buried deep inside of us—or gifted second-hand.<br><br>We celebrate a spirit that defies struggle.<br><br>We recognize the rich tapestry of our history—threads of clover green amid the red, white, and blue. <br><br>Happy St. Patrick’s Day. </p>
