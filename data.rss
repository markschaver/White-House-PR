<p>Today, President Biden will sign an Executive Order establishing the White House Initiative on Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders, and delivering on the President’s commitment to reinstate and reinvigorate this historic Initiative.</p>



<p>Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander (AA and NHPI) communities together constitute the fastest growing ethnic group in the United States and make invaluable contributions to our society, our economy, and our culture. Yet for far too long, systemic barriers to equity, justice, and opportunity have put the American dream out of reach for many AA and NHPI communities, and racism, nativism, and xenophobia against AA and NHPI communities continues to threaten safety and dignity of AA and NHPI families. The new Initiative is charged with driving an ambitious, whole-of-government agenda to advance equity, justice, and opportunity for AA and NHPI communities by:</p>



<ul><li>Helping to coordinate a comprehensive Federal response to the rise in acts of anti-Asian bias and violence</li><li>Addressing the systemic lack of disaggregated data on AA and NHPI communities in Federal statistical systems</li><li>Expanding language access and language assistance programs for AA and NHPI individuals across federal programs</li><li>Strengthening economic security and opportunity for AA and NHPI communities by empowering AA and NHPI entrepreneurs, building new workforce training opportunities, and promoting workplaces that are free from harassment against AA and NHPI workers</li><li>Addressing the concentration of poverty experienced in many AA and NHPI communities</li><li>Addressing disparities in educational outcomes for AA and NHPI students of all ages, and addressing bullying, harassment, and discrimination in our Nation’s schools</li><li>Advancing climate and environmental justice for AA and NHPI communities who are particularly impacted by the climate crisis and are overburdened by environmental degradation</li><li>Promoting inclusion and belonging for all AA and NHPI communities by strengthening public awareness and education about AA and NHPI communities, cultures, and traditions</li><li>Empowering AA and NHPI communities to be civically engaged, including through electoral participation</li><li>Building a Federal workforce where AA and NHPI public servants are leaders at the most senior levels of our government</li><li>Ensuring that AA and NHPI communities are empowered and equitably served by Federal funding, grants, and contracts</li></ul>



<p>The COVID-19 pandemic, and the xenophobic rhetoric used by certain political leaders during this crisis, have led to a tragic spike in acts of anti-Asian bias, violence, and xenophobia. At the same time, the pandemic has disproportionately burdened many AA and NHPI communities, and exposed the significant health inequities faced by many Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders in particular. To ensure that the Federal government is mitigating COVID-19 related anti-Asian bias, advancing health equity for all AA and NHPI communities, and ensuring AA and NHPI communities can equitably recover from these crises, the Initiative will be led out of the Department of Health and Human Services.</p>



<p>Today, President Biden also announced that Krystal Ka’ai has been selected to serve as Executive Director of the Initiative. Krystal has served as the Executive Director of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus (CAPAC) since 2013, leading legislative, communications, and outreach strategy for a bicameral caucus composed of more than 70 members in both the U.S. House of Representatives and U.S. Senate. She worked to advanced key priorities impacting the AAPI community, including health care, immigration, education, civil rights, economic development, and more. She previously served in various roles with the U.S. Senate Committee on Indian Affairs and the State of Hawai‘i.</p>



<p>In addition, the Executive Order establishes a renewed Presidential Advisory Commission on Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders. The Commission will advise the President on ways the public, private and non-profit sectors can work together to advance equity and opportunity for every AA and NHPI community. The Commission is also charged with advising the President on policies to address anti-Asian xenophobia and violence, ways to build capacity in AA and NHPI communities through federal grantmaking, and policies to address the intersectional barriers that AA and NHPI women, LGBTQ+ people, and people with disabilities face. The Commission will include AA and NHPI civic leaders from across the country, and will reflect the rich diversity of AA and NHPI communities throughout the United States.</p>



<p>These announcements build on the Biden-Harris Administration’s historic actions to combat bias, violence, and xenophobia against AA and NHPI communities, including:</p>



<p><strong>Signing the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act into law. </strong>On May 20, 2021, President Biden signed into law the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act, bipartisan legislation that will make significant improvements to our Nation’s response to hate crimes. The bill addresses two challenges: the lack of resources and training for state and local law enforcement to accurately identify and report hate crimes to the FBI, and the language and cultural barriers that many communities of color face in reporting hate crimes to law enforcement.</p>



<p>The COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act will strengthen the Federal coordination and response to hate crime incidents, especially those that victimize Asian American communities, by appointing a designated official at the Department of Justice whose sole job is to facilitate the expedited review of hate crimes related to COVID-19. The Department of Justice will also issue new guidance for state, city, and Tribal law enforcement agencies on how to establish online reporting of hate crimes. The law will provide resources to create specialized hate crimes units that will also help states create hotlines for hate crimes at state and local levels that will be accessible for people with limited English proficiency. And it provides resources for training for state and local law enforcement to identify, investigate, and report these heinous crimes.</p>



<p><strong>Signing a Presidential Memorandum Condemning and Combating Racism, Xenophobia, and Intolerance Against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in the United States. </strong>In his first week in office, President Biden signed a Memorandum which established that it is the official policy of the Biden-Harris Administration to stand up against racism, xenophobia, nativism, and bias. The Memorandum directs all Federal agencies to take steps to ensure their official actions mitigate anti-Asian bias and xenophobia, especially in the Nation’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Memorandum also charged the Department of Justice with partnering with AA and NHPI communities to respond to and prevent hate crimes and violence.</p>



<p><strong>Advancing equity and racial justice for AA and </strong><strong>NHPI</strong><strong> communities through the whole-of-government initiative. </strong>On his first day in office, President Biden signed a historic Executive Order establishing a whole-of-government initiative to advance equity and racial justice and root out systemic racism from federal policies, programs, institutions and laws. Under this Executive Order, all Federal agencies are charged with affirmatively advancing equity, civil rights, racial justice, and equal opportunity for the American people, including AA and NHPI communities.</p>



<p><strong>Appointing a White House Senior Liaison to Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander communities. </strong>President Biden announced the appointment of Erika L. Moritsugu to serve as Deputy Assistant to the President and Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander Senior Liaison. Moritsugu serves as a vital voice to advance the President and the Administration’s priorities.</p>



<p><strong>Creating a historically diverse Administration in which 15 percent of all appointees identify as Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. </strong>The Biden-Harris Administration reflects the diversity of the American people, and 15 percent of the Administration’s appointees identify as AAPI.</p>



<p><strong>Funding critical research to prevent and address bias and xenophobia against Asian American communities.</strong> The National Science Foundation (NSF) is taking a comprehensive approach to investing in research to understand, address, and end bias, discrimination and xenophobia, including against AAPI communities. NSF is currently supporting more than 100 grants across the country totaling more than $33 million dollars of investment. This wide array of researchers is advancing innovative studies to reveal new and more effective strategies for reducing the frequency and severity of discrimination experienced by historically underrepresented groups, and reduce targeting of, and violence towards, historically underrepresented communities and individuals, including Asian American communities.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Cuyahoga Community College<br>Cleveland, Ohio</p>



<p>2:23 P.M. EDT</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Thank you, all.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Please, please, please, please sit down.</p>



<p>Shilaah, thank you very much for sharing your story; it&#8217;s impressive.&nbsp; Dr. Johnson, everyone at Cuyahoga Community College, thank you for being here and having me here.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, by the way, to all the elected officials: You know what we call this in my business?&nbsp; We call this a “busman&#8217;s holiday” &#8212; (laughter) &#8212; to have to come and ride a bus again with another guy.&nbsp; You&#8217;re awful nice to be here.&nbsp; The only thing worse for an elected official when the President shows up is to say &#8212; the worst sentence in the English language is, “I&#8217;m at the airport.”&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; And so &#8212; so &#8212; thank you all so much.</p>



<p>You got some really great friends here, starting with Marcy.&nbsp; Anyway, Mr. Mayor, thank you.&nbsp; Dr. Johnson, thank you very much and &#8212; for letting me borrow, by the way, Marcia Fudge to serve as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>You know, certain places, just by chance and circumstance, can become markers in the course of your life or of a na- &#8212; of the course of the nation.&nbsp; And for me, Tri-C is one of those places.</p>



<p>Just a little over a year ago, March 10, 220- &#8212; in 2020, I came to Cleveland as a candidate running for President to rally &#8212; hold a rally here at the community college.&nbsp; Upon unloading, we got word that Governor DeWine &#8212; he did the right thing &#8212; wanted large indoor events to shut down because of the growing concerns over the virus and &#8212; spreading all across America.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There would be no rally that night, and life in America had changed.&nbsp; And a long, dark year was about to descend upon all of us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fourteen months later, we finally made it to campus.&nbsp; And from a year of darkness, we&#8217;re now emerging into the light.&nbsp; And I said from the very beginning: There&#8217;s no chance &#8212; no chance for this economy to come back unless we beat the pandemic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I remember Congressman Ryan and I talking about that a lot on the campaign trail.&nbsp; You had to beat the pandemic to bring the economy back.&nbsp; And so that&#8217;s what we set out to do with the help of a lot of the people that are right here.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And after administering 271 million doses of vaccine in the first 120 days &#8212; and we have &#8212; the cases are down now from January from &#8212; they’re down 83 percent &#8212; COVID cases &#8212; down.&nbsp; The number of deaths has fallen by 85 percent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Schools are reopening.&nbsp; Businesses are reopening.&nbsp; Restaurants are reopening.&nbsp; I hear that, as last night&#8217;s vaccine lottery, Ohio has a new millionaire.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; I tell you what: Who woulda thunk it?&nbsp; A million bucks for getting the vaccine.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; But it&#8217;s working.</p>



<p>Now, 56 percent of Ohioans have had at least one shot.&nbsp; We got to get to 70 percent.&nbsp; That&#8217;s the goal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve turned the tide on the once-in-a-century pandemic.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve turned the tide on a once-in-a-generation economic crisis.&nbsp; And families are beginning to be able to breathe just a little bit easier.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We still have work to do, but our future today is as bright and as wide open as it ever has been.&nbsp; And now we&#8217;re faced with a question: What kind of economy are we going to build for tomorrow?&nbsp; What are we going to do?&nbsp;</p>



<p>I believe this is our moment to rebuild an economy from the bottom up and the middle out, not a trickle-down economy from the very wealthy.&nbsp; That has never benefited people who are at this college or any other place where they&#8217;re trying to make a living.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To build an economy that rewards work, not just wealth.&nbsp; An economy that works for the backbone of this country &#8212; the people who get up every single day, work hard, raise their families, pay their taxes, serve their country, volunteer in their communities &#8212; just looking for a little bit of breathing room.&nbsp;</p>



<p>My dad used to say, “Just a little bit of breathing room, honey.”&nbsp; And Tim has heard me say this a thousand times &#8212; my dad used to say, “Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck.&nbsp; It&#8217;s about your dignity.&nbsp; It&#8217;s about respect.&nbsp; It&#8217;s about your place in the community.&nbsp; It&#8217;s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, ‘Honey, it&#8217;s going to be okay.’”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The last few months have demonstrated what that economy can look like.&nbsp; When &#8212; when our event here was canceled in March, our economy was on the brink of collapse.&nbsp; My mom used to have &#8212; especially say, “You know, the greatest gift God gave mankind was the ability forget.&nbsp; Because if it didn&#8217;t do that, every woman would only have one child.”&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>But all kidding aside, the good news is we forget the bad times.&nbsp; That&#8217;s the good thing about we Americans: We’re always optimistic.&nbsp; But 10 months &#8212; 10 months ago, we were in trouble.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When I was sworn in, there were 10 million fewer jobs in America, and a lot here in Ohio.&nbsp; But in my first three months in office, the economy has added back 500,000 jobs per month.&nbsp; In fact, we&#8217;ve created &#8212; with the help, again, of the members of Congress that are here today &#8212; 1.5 million jobs, more jobs than have ever been created in the first three months of any presidency in the history United States.</p>



<p>Before I took office, the average initial claims for unemployment insurance were over 830,000.&nbsp; This morning, we learned that number has fallen below 460,000 &#8212; cut in half the &#8212; and we&#8217;re at the lowest level we&#8217;ve seen since March 2020 when the pandemic first struck.</p>



<p>Before I took office, almost 24 million Americans were going hungry.&nbsp; Marcy has heard me say this before: Did you ever think you&#8217;d see people lined up for miles and miles and miles,&nbsp; going into a stadium to get someone to put a box of food in their trunk?&nbsp; People who never ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever thought they’d need that kind of help.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Well, that number of hungry Americans &#8212; food-starved Americans &#8212; has dropped by 30 percent.&nbsp; Still too many, but there&#8217;s clear progress.</p>



<p>Before I took office, independent experts were projecting that our economy would grow at 3 to 4 percent in the year 2021.&nbsp; But they’re now projecting that growth will be 6 percent or higher in 2021 &#8212; the fastest growth in this country in 40 years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To sum it up: COVID cases are down, COVID deaths are down, unemployment filings are down, hunger is down, vaccinations are up, jobs are up, growth is up, people gaining health coverage is up, small business confidence is up.&nbsp; Put it simply: America is coming back.&nbsp; America is on the move.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>And that wasn&#8217;t an accident.&nbsp; It wasn&#8217;t luck.&nbsp; It happened for two reasons.&nbsp; First, we made the vaccine program a priority.&nbsp; As my friends in Congress will tell you, I got a lot of heat for just focusing on the vaccine.&nbsp; It goes back to what we all talk about.&nbsp; You&#8217;ve got to fix the pandemic before you can fix the economy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We were able to, with a lot of hard work, get 600 million doses of the vaccine &#8212; enough for every single solitary American.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We didn&#8217;t have enough vaccinators, so we went to FEMA, the United States military, went to the AMA and got retired docs and nurses to come out of retirement &#8212; got thousands and thousands of additional people to administer the vaccines that we didn&#8217;t have before.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We created more places to get vaccinated, hitting my target to ensure that 90 percent of all Americans would have a vaccination site within five miles of where they live.&nbsp; And now, 50 percent of all of America &#8212; more than any other country &#8212; is fully vaccinated.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Seventy-five &#8212; seventy-five percent of seniors &#8212; Black, white, Hispanic &#8212; across the board are fully vaccinated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We&#8217;re getting lives back.&nbsp; The American economy is coming back.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s the second reason we&#8217;re on the move.&nbsp; I committed to an approach of building an American economy, a re- &#8212; a different economy to build back better, not just build back &#8212; build back better.&nbsp; That approach recognizes that we do &#8212; all do better when we all do well.&nbsp; And the best way to grow our economy is from the bottom up and the middle out.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You know, I don&#8217;t have any anything against &#8212; against anybody in Wall Street.&nbsp; I don’t have anything against anybody making a million bucks, but Wall Street did not build this country.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; The middle class built this country, and unions built the middle class.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; That&#8217;s a fact.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An approach that recognizes that this time when we rebuild the middle class, we have to bring everybody along, regardless of their background, regardless of their religion, regardless of their race.&nbsp; That’s the approach reflected in the American Rescue Plan, which my friends in the Congress helped get passed.</p>



<p>Because of that law, more than 167 million Americans got a rescue payment of $1,400 that’s gone out helping families pay their rent, pay their bills, buy their groceries &#8212; and maybe most important, gives them, for the first time, some hope &#8212; a little bit of hope.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hope goes a long, long, long way.&nbsp; Those checks matter. Small businesses, restaurants are getting &#8212; were getting killed.&nbsp; Now we’re delivering the loans and support they need to reopen and stay open.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Schools were struggling to reopen, so we made targeting vac- &#8212; teachers to get the vaccine as a priority.&nbsp; We delivered schools much-needed support.&nbsp; State and local governments &#8212; and you know, Mr. Mayor &#8212; a lot of them had to lay off their employees &#8212; cops, firefighters, first responders &#8212; because you have to balance your budget.</p>



<p>Well, now they&#8217;re coming back, thanks to the Rescue Plan. Beginning this summer, families with children will get tax relief &#8212; tax credit &#8212; the Child Tax Credit &#8212; which is going to deposit money directly into their banks every month until that money is paid out.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By the way, we had no problem passing a $2 trillion tax plan that went to the top 1 percent that wasn&#8217;t paid for at all; it just increased the debt $2 trillion.&nbsp; Every time I talk about tax cuts for working-class people, it’s, “Oh my god.”&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; “What are we going to do?”&nbsp; Well, we&#8217;re going to take back some of that 1 percent money and make them pay for it.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>And thanks in part to a part of the Rescue Plan named for an Ohio labor leader, Butch Lewis, championed by Sherrod Brown, who &#8212; I don&#8217;t think Sherrod is here today &#8212; hundreds of thousands of retirees and workers across Ohio and millions more across the country can trust that their pensions they work so damn hard for and sacrificed to secure will be there for them, unlike my dad who busted his neck his whole life, and when the company went under, he lost his pension completely.</p>



<p>Even my Republican friends in Congress, not a single one of them voted for the Rescue Plan.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not going to embarrass any one of them, but I have here a list &#8212; (laughter and applause) &#8212; of how, back in their districts, they&#8217;re bragging about the Rescue Plan.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They touted the re- &#8212; the Restaurant Revitalization Fund.&nbsp; They touted the fact that we&#8217;re in a situation where the &#8212; dealing with &#8212; touted grants to community healthcare centers, touted &#8212; I mean, some people have no shame.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>But I&#8217;m happy.&nbsp; I&#8217;m happy they know that it’s benefited their constituents.&nbsp; That&#8217;s okay with me.&nbsp; But if you&#8217;re going to try to take credit for what you&#8217;ve done, don&#8217;t get in the way of what we still need to do.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>The bottom line &#8212; the bottom line is this: The Biden economic plan is working.&nbsp; We’ve had record job creation.&nbsp; We&#8217;re seeing record economic growth.&nbsp; We&#8217;re creating a new paradigm &#8212; one that rewards work, the working people in this nation, not just those at the top.</p>



<p>We did a study: 85 percent of my Jobs Plan &#8212; or 95 percent of my Jobs Plan, you don&#8217;t need a bachelor&#8217;s degree; 75 percent, you don&#8217;t even need a degree that&#8217;s a community college degree &#8212; it helps, but guess what?&nbsp; The bottom line is that people are going to be going back to work.&nbsp; There&#8217;s a new bargain: Everyone is &#8212; is going to be in on the deal this time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, as our economy recovers, there&#8217;s going to be some bumps in the road; we know that &#8212; of course there will be.&nbsp; You can&#8217;t reboot a global economy like flipping on a light switch.&nbsp; There&#8217;s going to be ups and downs in jobs and economic reports.&nbsp; There&#8217;s going to be supply chain issues, price distortions on the way back to a stable and steady growth.</p>



<p>In the coming weeks, my administration will take steps to combat these supply pressures, starting with the construction materials and transportation bottlenecks, and building off the work we&#8217;re doing on computer chips.&nbsp; We&#8217;re also announcing new initiatives to combat anti-competitive practices that hurt small businesses and families.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fixing those problems can help build a more dynamic, innovative economy, and we&#8217;re going to have a lot more to say about that in the days ahead.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But this &#8212; this is already clear: We&#8217;re on the right track.&nbsp; The American Rescue Plan laid a strong foundation for a new economy that brings everybody along, but it&#8217;s just a first step.&nbsp; We&#8217;re going to build on the incentive and incredible progress that we&#8217;ve made and set America on a sustainable path to a faster, more inclusive economic growth.&nbsp; We have to start investing in ourselves again and the American people again.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Consider this: Three decades ago, the United States was number one &#8212; and some would argue number two &#8212; in the world for R&amp;D spending &#8212; research and development &#8212; as a share of our economy.&nbsp; You know where we are now in the international competition?&nbsp; We’re number nine.&nbsp; Nine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, China was number eight in their overall spending in research and development three decades ago; they&#8217;re now number two.&nbsp; Number two.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This past year, Japan, Canada, Italy, France, and the EU have announced significant infrastructure spending.&nbsp; China has announced that they&#8217;re increasing their research and development spending dramatically.&nbsp; Japan is making huge investments in reducing carbon emissions and building out the digital capacity they have.&nbsp; The &#8212; the European Union as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’re in a race to see who wins the 21st century.&nbsp; Now if I could hold just for a second here &#8212; one of the things I&#8217;ve found &#8212; I&#8217;ve s- &#8212; you know, I&#8217;m supposedly &#8212; they&#8217;d always announce me in the past as an expert in foreign policy.&nbsp; Well, let me tell you something: Economic policy is harder than foreign policy.&nbsp; You know what the basis of foreign policy is in our stature in the world?&nbsp; One thing: our economic prowess.&nbsp; Our economic prowess.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We must be number one in the world to lead the world in the 21st century.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a simple proposition.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>And the starting gun has already gone off.&nbsp; We can&#8217;t afford to fall any further behind.&nbsp; Now is the time to build the foundation that we&#8217;ve laid &#8212; to make bold investments in our families, in our communities, in our nation.&nbsp; We know from history that these kinds of investments raise both the floor and the ceiling of the economy for everybody.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Like, when we brought electricity to every household in the country in 1930s or we connected the country through the Interstate Highway System in the ’50s.&nbsp; They created millions of jobs, good-paying jobs.&nbsp; They set the economy up to grow more quickly and share prosperity more broadly for decades to come.&nbsp; Those electrical poles and wires still help power rural communities 80 years after they were built, and it&#8217;s time now to rebuild them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A quarter of all the miles Americans travel on roads are on the Interstate Highway System built 60 years ago &#8212; 60 years after we build it.&nbsp; These are generational investments.&nbsp; Private sector does not make these kind of investments.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve neglected that kind of public investment for much too long.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The pandemic exposed just how badly we need to invest in the foundation of this country and the working people of this country.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why I proposed the American Jobs Plan and the American&#8217;s Family Plan &#8212; the generational investments we need today to succeed for tomorrow.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You know, as my wife Jill, who’s been a teacher for a long time &#8212; she used to be about 10 years younger than me; now she&#8217;s 30 years younger than me &#8212; (laughter) &#8212; and she is in every way, God love her.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; She&#8217;s the only First Lady ever to work full time &#8212; full time.&nbsp; She teaches 15 credits at a community college &#8212; 15 credits.&nbsp; She&#8217;s a remarkable person. &nbsp;And she&#8217;s out in Missouri right now and Kansas [City] doing other things &#8212; nothing to do with her job as a teacher.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But my point is this, Jill has a constant refrain: “Joey, any nation that out-educates us is going to outcompete us.”&nbsp; It’s a simple proposition.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You know, think about this: One of the reasons that &#8212; that caused us to move ahead so significantly as a world leader &#8212; an economic leader in the world was that in the late 1800s, early 1900s, we were the first nation in the world to say, “We&#8217;re going to have 12 years of free &#8212; without any limitation &#8212; free education.&nbsp; Twelve years.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now imagine if &#8212; and the rest of the world has caught up with us, and they&#8217;ve now passed us in many cases.&nbsp; Imagine if we were sitting today and say, &#8220;We&#8217;re going to set up an education system.&#8221;&nbsp; Does anybody think 12 years of education is enough for us to compete in the world in the second quarter of the 21st century?&nbsp; I&#8217;m not joking.&nbsp; Just &#8212; just consciously think about that.&nbsp; Is it enough?&nbsp; It&#8217;s not.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so, I&#8217;m proposing four additional years of education: two years of high-quality pre-K for three- and four-years-old &#8212; not in daycare, in school.&nbsp; The studies show that if you do that, those children have an opportunity of 56 better &#8212; 56 percent better chance of going through all 12 years of school and beyond without getting into any trouble, no matter what the background or the family they come from.&nbsp; No matter what.&nbsp; On the front end, those two years are important.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And then two years of free community college.&nbsp; Free community college &#8212; (applause) &#8212; to better prepare our people to get these good-paying jobs of the future &#8212; jobs I saw students training for throughout the Manufacturing Technology Center.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You know, we need to invest in transportation infrastructure.&nbsp; Drive anywhere and you can see why we&#8217;re rated 13th in the world in infrastructure.&nbsp; The United States of America is viewed to have the 13th-best infrastructure in the world.&nbsp; Come on.&nbsp; This United States of America, for God&#8217;s sake.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We need to invest in universal high-speed Internet, more seamlessly connect our businesses and their customers, expand the possibilities of job opportunities in every hometown in America, no matter how big or small.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, by the way, if you&#8217;ll hold for a second &#8212; think about this.&nbsp; How many of you men and women have children who were doing remote learning?&nbsp; Think of all the children throughout the country, in inner cities and in rural areas, that had no Internet connection.&nbsp; It&#8217;s estimated that some of those kids are going to be pushed &#8212; although it&#8217;s only been one year &#8212; three years behind in their education.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Look, investment in high-growth industries like clean energy and electric vehicles &#8212; it&#8217;s not just we want to deal with the environment.&nbsp; We want to lead the world in exports of these new technologies instead of ceding the global market and job creation to the Chinese.&nbsp; They&#8217;re building 20 times as many electric vehicles as we&#8217;re doing now, and the technology that goes with that.&nbsp; What are we doing?&nbsp; It&#8217;s millions of jobs in China instead of here.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not that it&#8217;s the jobs we&#8217;re going to create here, but that we&#8217;re going to create to the export the technology.&nbsp; We used to be the net exporter of major technologies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I also think and am pushing very hard to make major investments in medicines and cures of the future.&nbsp; Folks, diseases like Alzheimer&#8217;s, diabetes, cancer &#8212; they&#8217;re all on the cusp of being able to be dealt with.&nbsp; You know, if we don&#8217;t do something about Alzheimer&#8217;s in America, every single, solitary hospital bed that exists in America &#8212; as the nurses can tell you &#8212; every single one will be occupied in the next 15 years with an Alzheimer&#8217;s patient &#8212; every one &#8212; costing us in excess of a trillion dollars.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So what are we doing?&nbsp; I came up with an idea, and I think is going to get done.&nbsp; And that is that &#8212; you know, there&#8217;s a thing called DARPA, which is the Defense Applied Application Research &#8212; it&#8217;s an outfit that came up with the Internet in the Defense Department, it came up with geospacing and a whole range of things that are related to our security.&nbsp; I want to do the same thing at the NIH to focus on those diseases.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s estimated if we do spend &#8212; if we spend $5 billion a year on that research and development, focusing with &#8212; on insurance companies can&#8217;t &#8212; don&#8217;t have the money to focus on &#8211;we can make significant breakthroughs.&nbsp; We&#8217;re already doing that &#8212; already doing that.</p>



<p>If we invest, we can create millions of jobs rebuilding the foundation of a strong, fair, resilient, competitive economy, and save hundreds of thousands of lives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And 100 percent of our investment is going to be guided by one principle: Make it in America.&nbsp; Make it in America.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>If I can hold that for just a second, there is a law that was passed in the &#8217;30s &#8212; doesn&#8217;t violate any trade principle &#8212; saying that whatever money &#8212; that whatever program that taxpayers are paying for, you can spend it all on American contractors.&nbsp; No one&#8217;s ever done it &#8212; though, I promise you, I signed an executive order.&nbsp; If in fact we&#8217;re building the new deck of an aircraft carrier &#8212; well, guess what? &#8212; I get, as President, to make &#8212; let contracts for over $600 billion a year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I promise you, there&#8217;ll be no contract let to a foreign company or any of the product down the line.&nbsp; Right now, what can happen is you can hire an American company and they can sublet to &#8212; and they can &#8212; their downstream product can all be foreign.&nbsp; All you got to do is get that particular agency to say, &#8220;You got an exception.&nbsp; We can&#8217;t find that job here in America.&#8221;</p>



<p>Well, guess what?&nbsp; They&#8217;re going to find the job here in America, I promise you, or they&#8217;re not going to get the contracts.&nbsp; These jobs will be good jobs &#8212; American jobs that deliver good wages and dignity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And look, this is about choice.&nbsp; We can give &#8212; we can keep giving every break in the world to corporations and CEOs, or we can raise the corporate tax rate back to 28 percent.&nbsp; It was, by the way, 36 percent.&nbsp; It came down to 28 percent, which is still lower than it was at any point between World War One and 2017, and they&#8217;re making trillions of dollars.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m going to tell you this to the press again: In the 10-year period between &#8217;14 and &#8217;24 &#8212; excuse me, between &#8217;10 and &#8217;20 &#8212; 2010 and 2020, they made over a trillion dollars.&nbsp; I think that&#8217;s good.&nbsp; You know what they did with a trillion dollars?&nbsp; They went out and they bought back 56 percent of their stock.&nbsp; Because the more they buy back, the more valuable the stock, and that&#8217;s how CEOs get paid.</p>



<p>CEOs used to get paid 35, 36 times to the average employee, and they should get paid.&nbsp; Now it&#8217;s over 370 times more than the average employee.&nbsp; As my mother would say, &#8220;Who died and left them boss?&#8221;&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; No, I&#8217;m serious about it.</p>



<p>Now &#8212; so you got over 50 percent going to stock buybacks.&nbsp; And the other percent &#8212; I think it&#8217;s 42 percent &#8212; you get &#8212; let me see, 56 &#8212; it&#8217;s 40 &#8212; no, it&#8217;s 38 percent goes to dividends, which is reasonable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But here&#8217;s the point.&nbsp; After all is said and done, that leaves 8 percent of that trillion dollars for research and development, salaries, new product, new enterprises, new initiatives &#8212; 8 percent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I come from the corporate capital of the world, literally.&nbsp; More corporations are incorporated in the state of Delaware than in any place in America combined &#8212; all the rest of the corporate registrations combined don&#8217;t equal what&#8217;s in my state.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It used to be corporations felt they had responsibilities beyond their taxpayer &#8212; beyond their shareholders and beyond their executives.&nbsp; But what is it now?&nbsp; The average CEO becomes a CEO for six to seven years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And by the way, capitalism has incentives.&nbsp; One of the worst votes ever made was during the Carter &#8212; the Clinton administration, to say a corporation could not deduct in tax &#8212; deduct from their taxes more than a million dollars of pay for any CEO.&nbsp; So guess what they start doing?&nbsp; Eighty-some percent of CEOs now get paid in stock options.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Why do you think they buy back the stock?&nbsp; To raise the price in &#8212; of the stock.&nbsp; They&#8217;re not bad guys.&nbsp; It&#8217;s just the incentives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So if we just raised the corporate tax to 28 percent, which is still lower than where it was, as I said, between World War One and 2017, that generates 90 billion additional dollars into the Treasury for a year, per year.&nbsp; That could put hundreds of thousands of people to work to modernize our roads, our bridges, our ports, our airports, and pay for it &#8212; pay for it.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>Put people to work to make sure every American has access to high-speed Internet so businesses can compete in the 21st century, kids in every community can get ahead.&nbsp; Another choice.</p>



<p>We can ask the top 1 percent of the taxpayers in America to get &#8212; pay the same tax rate they paid when George W. Bush was President.&nbsp; You know how much that would generate?&nbsp; That would generate $13 billion per year, allowing every student in America to go to community college for free.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When I was in the last administration that I was part of &#8212; Obama-Biden &#8212; the President asked me to find out what the major corporate entities thought was the most important thing they needed.&nbsp; We interviewed over 340 &#8212; I think it was 348 CEOs.&nbsp; You know what they said &#8212; everyone of them?&nbsp; A better-educated workforce.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But they&#8217;re not spending money to educate the workforce, so imagine what we’d do &#8212; corporate America benefits with a better-educated population.&nbsp; Do you want to give the wealthiest people in America another tax cut?&nbsp; I &#8212; by the way, I don&#8217;t begrudge them the money they made, just start paying your fair share, just a little bit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In consequence, it would help every high school graduate earn an education like students here at Tri-C, one that puts people on a path to good-paying jobs in industries of the future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Look, I know &#8212; I know you know what&#8217;s best for America.&nbsp; And by the way, better-educated public helps everybody.&nbsp; Look, my plan is &#8212; my plan is the right way to invest, spreading key investments over time so we limit the price pressure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is the right time to invest when we have historically low interest rates, investing now with a plan to pay for it.&nbsp; That is the fiscally responsible thing to do.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course, there are critics out there who want to stand still.&nbsp; By the way, some of those critics are the same people who said that money was no object when it came, as I said, to that $2 trillion tax cut that went to the wealthiest 1 percent of America, who hold 30 percent of all the wealth in the country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But when we need to fix a road or a water system, or help millions of people return to the workforce by helping them afford childcare or eldercare, or help afford &#8212; attend &#8212; the ability to attend Tri-C, they think that&#8217;s &#8212; that&#8217;s a bridge too far.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Investing in America again is going to create growth and more jobs, but there&#8217;s something else we have to do to ensure the high-quality jobs exist.&nbsp; We must restore the connection between the success of our economy and the people who produce that success &#8212; hardworking Americans.&nbsp; The connection has been severed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You all remember &#8212; it used to be the case in this country when you were a part of generating success of a company, you got to share in the benefits.&nbsp; That&#8217;s long since gone &#8212; not a joke.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And by the way, I &#8212; I&#8217;m a capitalist.&nbsp; But here&#8217;s the deal: From 1948 after the war, to 1977 &#8212; I think it was 1977 &#8212; ’79 &#8212; productivity in America grew by 100 percent.&nbsp; We made more things &#8212; productivity.&nbsp; You know what the workers’ pay grew?&nbsp; By 100 percent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since 1979, all that changed.&nbsp; Produc- &#8212; productivity has grown four times faster than pay has grown.&nbsp; The basic bargain in this country has been broken.&nbsp; If you work hard and contribute to the success of enterprise, you get to share in the success &#8212; that&#8217;s not the case anymore &#8212; so you could carve out your place in the middle class.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That&#8217;s how it happens.&nbsp; That&#8217;s how it works in healthy capitalist economies.&nbsp; But along the way, we started seeing the stock market and corporate profits and executive pay as the sole measure of our economic success.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let me tell you something.&nbsp; My sole measure of economic success is how working families are doing, whether they have jobs that deliver dignity.&nbsp; That means we have to focus on wages like we used to.</p>



<p>When it comes to the economy we&#8217;re building, rising wages aren&#8217;t a bug; they&#8217;re a feature.&nbsp; We want to get &#8212; we want to get something economists call “full employment.”&nbsp; Instead of workers competing with each other for jobs that are scarce, we want employees to compete with each other to attract work.&nbsp; We want the &#8212; the companies to compete to attract workers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That kind of competition in the market doesn&#8217;t just give workers more ability to earn a higher wage, it gives them the power to demand to be treated with dignity and respect in the workplace.&nbsp; And it helps ensure that America &#8212; when you walk into work, you don&#8217;t have to check your right to be treated with respect at the door.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Full employment” also means more options and opportunities for workers &#8212; including Black, Hispanic workers, Amer- &#8212; Asian American workers, women &#8212; who&#8217;ve been left behind in previous economic recoveries when the labor market never tighten- &#8212; tightened up enough.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Look, this isn&#8217;t just good for individual workers, it also makes our economy a whole lot stronger.&nbsp; When American workers have more money to spend, American businesses benefit.&nbsp; We all benefit.&nbsp; Higher wages and more options for workers are a good thing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A lot of companies have done extremely well in this crisis, and good for them.&nbsp; Good for them.&nbsp; The simple fact is, though, corporate profits are the highest they&#8217;ve been in decades, and workers’ pay is at the lowest it has been in 70 years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have more than ample room to raise workers pay without raising customer prices.&nbsp; Soaring corporate profits and stagnant wages aren&#8217;t the American Dream, and they aren&#8217;t the American deal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Look, I&#8217;m not looking to punish anyone or to say business shouldn&#8217;t be able to make a significant profit.&nbsp; I understand the risk and challenges businessowners face, and they should be rewarded for the success and the risks they take.&nbsp; I just think, after decades of workers getting a raw deal, it&#8217;s time they be given a fair shake.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>Well, wait until you see what happens when employers have to compete for workers.&nbsp; Companies like McDonald&#8217;s, Home Depot, Bank of America, and others &#8212; what do they have to do?&nbsp; They have to raise wages to attract workers.&nbsp; That&#8217;s the way it&#8217;s supposed to be.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And we got to do two more things.&nbsp; Congress should raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; No one &#8212; no one should work 40 hours a week and live in poverty, live below the poverty level.&nbsp; And we ought to pass the Protect the Right to Organize &#8212; the PRO Act &#8212; supported by union workers.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>Look, let me close with this.&nbsp; You know, it&#8217;s an overused phrase these days, but it&#8217;s still accurate: We’re at an inflection point in American history.&nbsp; It happens every several generations.&nbsp; We have a chance to seize the economic momentum of the first months of my administration not just to build back, but to build back better.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And this time, we&#8217;re going to deal everyone in &#8212; everyone that has been left out &#8212; and breathe new life into the middle class and new hope into those struggling to break into the middle class.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have a chance to make investments that Moody&#8217;s &#8212; not a liberal think tank &#8212; Wall Street, Moody&#8217;s &#8212; says my plan will increase the size of our economy by $4.5 trillion &#8212; Moody&#8217;s &#8212;&nbsp; $4.5 trillion over the next decade, and create well over 16 million new good-paying jobs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If we make these investments now, in 50 years, people are going to look back &#8212; and not even that long &#8212; your children or grandchildren will look back and say this was the moment when America won the future.&nbsp; Won the future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Folks, I’ve said it a thousand times &#8212; I mean it from the bottom of my heart: There is not a single thing America can&#8217;t do when we do it together.&nbsp; Never.&nbsp; We&#8217;re the only country in the world that has &#8212; when we set our mind to something, that has never ever, ever, ever failed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is an opportunity for the wealthy to stay wealthy, the poor to have a shot at the middle class, and the middle class to be able to breathe more easily.&nbsp; That’s what this is about.&nbsp; But this time, bring everybody along &#8212; everybody.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thank you.&nbsp; And God bless you.&nbsp; And may God protect our troops.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong><em>12 companies and organizations announce commitments to support economic development in the Northern Triangle, as part of the Call to Action launch</em></strong></p>



<p>In her role overseeing diplomatic efforts within El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras (the “Northern Triangle”), and with Mexico, Vice President Kamala Harris announced today a <em>Call to Action</em> for businesses and social enterprises to make new, significant commitments to help send a signal of hope to the people of the region and sustainably address the root causes of migration by promoting economic opportunity.<a> </a>As part of this <em>Call to Action</em> launch, 12 companies and organizations announced commitments to support inclusive economic development in the Northern Triangle, including: Accion, Bancolombia, Chobani, Davivienda, Duolingo, the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, Mastercard, Microsoft, Nespresso, Pro Mujer, the Tent Partnership for Refugees, and the World Economic Forum.</p>



<p>Our comprehensive strategy to address the root causes of migration will involve significant commitments of U.S. government resources to support the long-term development of the region—including efforts to foster economic opportunity, strengthen governance, combat corruption, and improve security. This approach will leverage commitments and resources from the governments in the Northern Triangle, as well as partnerships with multilateral development banks and international financial institutions.</p>



<p>Supporting the long-term development of the region, and in the Western Hemisphere more broadly, will require more than just the resources of the U.S. government. For this reason, Vice President Harris is calling on the private sector to draw on its unique resources and expertise to make commitments to support inclusive economic growth in the Northern Triangle<a>. </a>Together, we can work to overcome obstacles to investment, promote economic opportunity, and support long-term development in the region.  The Administration looks forward to increased collaboration with private companies—U.S., foreign, and local in the Northern Triangle and Latin America more broadly—to build upon this <em>Call to Action </em>in the months and years to come. </p>



<p><strong>U.S. Government Long-Term Commitments and <em>Call to Action</em> Focus Areas</strong></p>



<p>This <em>Call to Action</em> is one component under the U.S. government’s comprehensive, long-term strategy to address barriers to investment and to promote economic opportunity in the Northern Triangle. Just as government action alone will not be enough to achieve meaningful outcomes, private sector commitments will be facilitated and supported by strong U.S. government initiatives to address longstanding impediments to investment-led growth. Under our broader strategy, near-term private sector commitments will be mutually reinforced by sustained U.S. government efforts to foster a business-enabling environment, increased private sector investment, and sustainable economic growth and opportunity. As part of the broader strategy, this&nbsp;<em>Call to Action&nbsp;</em>aims to generate new commitments from businesses and social enterprises in six focus areas with an emphasis on supporting vulnerable populations, including women and youth, in the Northern Triangle region. These focus areas include:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Reform Agenda – </strong>Commitments to support greater transparency, predictability, and stability in the business enabling environment by facilitating regional government efforts to adopt international best practices in licensing, permitting, procurement, regulation, and taxation.<br></li><li><strong>Digital and Financial Inclusion –</strong> Commitments to expand affordable internet access and participation in the digital economy; facilitate access to financial technologies and capital for small businesses, particularly women- and indigenous-owned businesses; and ensure that the most vulnerable and the most likely to migrate have access to basic public services and financial institutions.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Food Security and Climate-smart Agriculture</strong> <strong>–</strong> Commitments to combat food shortages by increasing agricultural productivity and crop resilience.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Climate Adaptation and Clean Energy – </strong>Commitments to support the region’s resilience to climate change through adaptation and mitigation efforts; support industries impacted by climate change; and transition to clean energy.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Education and Workforce Development </strong>– Commitments to expand job-training programs; support greater access to technical and secondary education; and create higher paying formal sector jobs, especially for women and in rural areas.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Public Health Access </strong>– Commitments to support regional governments in addressing the impact of COVID-19 on their populations; build robust and resilient health economies to confront future health challenges; support access to clean water and sanitation; and ensure inclusive access to healthcare.&nbsp;</li></ul>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Aboard Air Force One<br>En Route Cleveland, OH</p>



<p>12:39 P.M. EDT<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Hi, everyone.&nbsp; Sorry.&nbsp; Thanks for your patience &#8212; a little business happening on the early part of the flight.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Okay, welcome to our trip to Cleveland.&nbsp; Today, the President will deliver a speech on the economy where he will make a clear case that his economic plan is working.&nbsp; And he&#8217;ll discuss the economic inflection point we stand at and the opportunity before us.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>His remarks will be, as you all know, at Cuyahogie [sic] Community &#8212; Cuyahoga Community College &#8212; or “Tri-C,” as it is called locally &#8212; the site of the last rally he was scheduled to hold as a candidate in March of 2020 before the pandemic shut down our country.&nbsp; There, he’ll note the remarkable progress we&#8217;ve made in defeating COVID-19.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>During his speech, he will make the case that his economic &#8212; I already conveyed that.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Today&#8217;s positive GDP report is the latest proof that his policies are healing the economy and getting Americans back to work.&nbsp; We&#8217;re creating an average of 500,000 jobs a month, eight times more than before President Biden took office.&nbsp; And unemploy- &#8212; and unemployment insurance claims &#8212; out this morning &#8212; hit their lowest level since March of 2020.<br>&nbsp;<br>The four-week moving average of unemployment insurance claims has dropped by nearly 50 percent since the President took office.&nbsp; And these weekly numbers can be volatile &#8212; as we know, and we all discuss &#8212; but we&#8217;re encouraged by the fact that the four-week average continues to trend down.<br>&nbsp;<br>In his remarks, he will also make a forceful case that higher wages are good for American workers and good for our economy.&nbsp; He&#8217;ll argue that we need to make our tax code wo- &#8212; work fa- &#8212; work &#8212; ensure our tax code favors work not wealth so big corporations are incentivized to invest in America, not on stock buybacks or CEO pay.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And he&#8217;ll talk about the need to make generational investments in our economy &#8212; through the Jobs Plan and the Families Plan &#8212; and advanced manufacturing; two years of community college; roads, bridges, broadband, and a host of other areas that will create good-paying jobs and help us outcompete the world.<br>&nbsp;<br>With that, kick us off.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.&nbsp; The President spoke briefly on the tarmac about the Republican counteroffer on infrastructure.&nbsp; I was hoping you could give a little bit more on that.&nbsp; And to confirm that he&#8217;s going to be with Senator Capito next week, if you could confirm that.&nbsp; And then, also, will he be meeting with the other group &#8212; this bipartisan group &#8212; that includes Senator Romney?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; Did a &#8212; did the statement that was out in my name come out before you took off?<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Yeah.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; I just wanted to absolutely make sure of that.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So, as the President conveyed, and as it was conveyed in my statement earlier today, we are certainly encouraged to see Senator Capito&#8217;s group come forward with the kind of funding level &#8212; nearly $1 trillion &#8212; that they discussed with the President.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>This is a negotiation, so the discussions will be ongoing.&nbsp; And, as he noted on the tarmac, and as you&#8217;ve seen in many &#8212; some of your reporting, there are a number of Republicans who&#8217;ve come forward with ideas who we are open to discussing and continuing to engage with.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>In terms of the schedule for next week, it&#8217;s not quite set yet.&nbsp; We&#8217;re working around, of course, the President is going to Tulsa, Oklahoma, and other components of his week.&nbsp; But he will be closely engaged with Senator Capito&#8217;s group and with other groups as they have ideas come forward.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And obviously, Memorial Day is Monday, so that deadline is going to come and go.&nbsp; How much longer is the White House willing to go for these talks?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, first, I’ll say that the Memorial Day timeline was always an opportunity for us to make an assessment of what the path forward looked like.&nbsp; And now, we&#8217;re look &#8212;&nbsp; we&#8217;re heading into Memorial Day weekend.&nbsp; We have a counteroffer on the table where the number came up significantly from the prior offer, where there was an increase in proposed funding in roads, rails, and bridges.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>There are some areas that we would like to see more funding in that we think are essential to the American workforce.&nbsp; So this is a disc- &#8212; discussion and negotiation.<br>&nbsp;<br>As we look ahead, we think &#8212; we look at next week, we know it&#8217;s Memorial Day week; it&#8217;s going to be a work week for us.&nbsp; It&#8217;s going to be a week where we continue to be engaged with a range of members of Congress.&nbsp; And we look forward to making progress before Congress resumes on June 7th.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last one.&nbsp; COVID relief &#8212; the COVID relief funds, is that a nonstarter using those?&nbsp; Is that a nonstarter?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; The &#8212; well, here&#8217;s the &#8212; here is the reason why that would be difficult to be a key funding mechanism: 95 percent of it is already allocated.&nbsp; Five percent of it would go towards some key areas, including boosting up small businesses, restaurants; rebuilding veterans’ hospitals &#8212; something that is of personal importance to the President.&nbsp; We think there are better ways to pay for it, and we think people should have a full understanding of what that is proposing.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You are saying 95 percent of the Rescue Plan is allocated already?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right.&nbsp; Okay.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; The COVID funds, which, I think, is the same synonym.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right. Right.&nbsp; And can I &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there a red line about the care economy?&nbsp; You&#8217;ve made a big deal about including funding for human infrastructure; the Republicans don&#8217;t include that at all in their proposal.&nbsp; So is that a red line for the President?&nbsp; Does that have to be in there, or is there some other way to get that funding through?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I&#8217;m not &#8212; I&#8217;m not here to set new red lines.&nbsp; What I will &#8212; his only red line is inaction, but he &#8212; that has been included in our counterproposal back, even as we came down $550 billion last week.&nbsp; That shows how much of a priority it is to the President.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>This is an ongoing negotiation.&nbsp; We&#8217;ll continue to have discussions about how to move it forward.&nbsp; There are a range of mechanisms to move ideas forward in Congress, and we&#8217;re open to that as well.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you have a particular day where you want to make a call about, you know, giving up on the hope of a bipartisan deal or, you know, wanting to get to one by a particular day?&nbsp; Is there a go/no-go date on the calendar?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Why would we do that now?&nbsp; We have a counterproposal and a range of others who want to have a discussion.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#8217;m not saying now.&nbsp; But, like, is it two weeks from now?&nbsp; Is it six weeks from now?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I think we &#8212; our focus is on continuing to work on having these discussions and negotiations through the course of next week.&nbsp; Again, it will be active; it will be engaged.&nbsp; We will be working hard.&nbsp; We&#8217;ll be in touch with Republicans and Democrats through the course of the recess week.&nbsp; And we&#8217;ll look forward to, when they resume, seeing what our path forward looks like.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But at least Senator Toomey had asked also for an accounting of how the funds &#8212; the American Rescue Plan funds &#8212; have been spent already.&nbsp; Is that something you can or will provide to Capitol Hill?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, the President has been clear to his team that we should be engaged and be responsive to any follow-up questions members and their teams have.&nbsp; And I&#8217;m certain that will be applicable here.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To the timing &#8212; can we go back to the timing, just to clarify one thing?&nbsp; So, next week is the recess week; the meetings will go on.&nbsp; You mentioned, I think, in your statement June 7th week, which is the following week, as, sort of, a week that the Congress is back to do some work.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So, is that &#8212; should we look for some kind of ending point at that point &#8212; that week, at the end of that week?&nbsp; Is there a point that you all are talking about?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; It&#8217;s ended when the President signs the legislation into law.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, today, he said to us on the tarmac &#8220;very soon&#8221; &#8212; I think was his phrase.&nbsp; So I was trying to figure out what that meant &#8212; that he was wanting to get something done very soon.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; He said &#8220;the summer.&#8221;&nbsp; That&#8217;s very soon.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I ask a foreign policy question?&nbsp; So Secretary Blinken just wrapped up a trip to Egypt where he met with President Sisi &#8212; talking about Israel and Palestinian conflict, but also the Nile Dam.&nbsp; Was the Nile Dam a negotiation tactic or a bargaining chip to secure Egypt&#8217;s support for the Gaza truce?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; It sounds like a question for the State Department given it was the Secretary&#8217;s trip.&nbsp; I would point you to the State Department.<br>&nbsp;<br>Go ahead.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, is the expectation that the White House will offer another counterproposal as these talks continue next week?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I think we have to see how the discussions go.&nbsp; As was conveyed in my statement, there were areas where they came up; that&#8217;s encouraging.&nbsp; There are areas where we&#8217;d still like to see increased funding because we think it&#8217;s important to small businesses, to workers, to our clean energy economy.&nbsp; So that gives you a sense of what we&#8217;re looking to see more of.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And can I ask something on gun safety quickly after the San Jose shooting?&nbsp; The administration had mentioned, last month, there were still some executive actions the President was considering on this.&nbsp; Where does that stand?&nbsp; And has anything changed as a result of the mass shooting yesterday in California?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, clearly, every time there&#8217;s a mass shooting &#8212; and certainly the one we saw last night &#8212; it&#8217;s heartbreaking and devastating.&nbsp; And this is an issue that impacts the President personally, and he certainly noted that to all of us yesterday.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>We are continuing to review what additional actions we can take, even while we&#8217;re pressing Congress to move forward with universal background check legislation.&nbsp; There&#8217;s a legal and policy review process for that, so it&#8217;s not that it can be expedited; it&#8217;s ongoing.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>But it&#8217;s a reminder to everyone &#8212; people who work in government, people in the public &#8212; about the need for additional gun safety measures.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On G7, Jen, can you have &#8212; give us an idea of how the strategy from the Biden administration to shore up other G7 leaders, in terms of creating a global strategy against a pandemic and vaccine sharing &#8212; how is that shaping up now?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, first, I would say: As you all know, we have announced that we will be donating 80 million doses to the global community.&nbsp; What is happening now behind the scenes is that &#8212; is there is an internal policy process to determine how we can do that in an equitable and transparent way.<br>&nbsp;<br>I know you are all eager to know where they are going and what our process will be.&nbsp; We certainly understand that.&nbsp; We hope to have more soon.&nbsp; That will certainly be a point of discussion, we expect.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And certainly, any questions that come up from our partner countries in the G7 or conversations in NATO about how we can work together to get the pandemic under control, we expect it to be a large topic of conversation at the meetings.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the expectation that the G7 countries will come up with some sort of agreement that, &#8220;This is how we&#8217;re going to help the world in terms of overcoming the pandemic and vaccine sharing&#8221;?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We’re a couple of weeks away from the G7 meeting even starting, so I&#8217;m not going to get ahead of any discussions.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will the President be meeting with the Queen while he&#8217;s in the United Kingdom?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have anything to announce at this point in time.&nbsp; Who among us wouldn&#8217;t want to meet with the Queen?&nbsp; But we&#8217;ll let them announce any invitation.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I ask you, on the G7 summit &#8212; one of the issues is also sort of the shortage of semiconductors.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is that &#8212; do you see, like, some movement going forward &#8212; both at the G7 level, but then, you know, in a sort of broader, multilateral group, perhaps?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And then, also, you are completing the supply-chain review; I think that&#8217;s supposed to be complete next week.&nbsp; Can you say a word or two about that and what your plans are for releasing that?&nbsp; And there&#8217;s four industrial sectors that are being looked at there.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; So, certainly, the semiconductor shortage is something that we do raise with partners and allies around the world.&nbsp; In terms of how it will fall on the agenda, I don&#8217;t have anything to preview on that front.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>But as the President has conveyed, as Jake Sullivan has conveyed, as Brian Deese has conveyed, this is a priority.&nbsp; It&#8217;s going to help our manufacturing workforce, jobs in the United States, and something that we&#8217;re looking to partners to help address, as, you know, we&#8217;ve seen over the past several weeks.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>I don’t think I have anything to preview for you in terms of the supply chain review, in terms of what we would put out publicly on that.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But you are &#8212; you are expecting to complete that next week and you will release it?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I think that&#8217;s the intention, but I don&#8217;t know what format or anything at this point.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, can I ask you a question about the &#8212; there is some reporting that the administration plans to lift the restriction on the border with Canada on June 22nd.&nbsp; Can you confirm that?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And a follow-up to that is: Will the United States look at re- &#8212; lifting those together &#8212; so both southern and northern, at the same time?&nbsp; Or is that something that can be done separately?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; You mean Title 42 on the border?&nbsp; One, that &#8212; that would be &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There’s Canadian reporting that says it’s being lifted.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, it was &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The northern border.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; It was just extended for about a month, I think, so that&#8217;s around that timeline.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t think a decision has been made, that I&#8217;m aware of, about what would happen after that point.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; And in terms of the southern border and Title 42, that&#8217;s really ro- &#8212; we rely on the CDC and their guidelines about what we need to do to continue to address the global pandemic.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But would one happen over the other?&nbsp; Or would they be simultaneous &#8212; northern and southern?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I &#8212; I don&#8217;t &#8212; I think they assess them differently &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; &#8212; but I &#8212; I certainly would point you to the CDC and DHS about how make those &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me ask you this question a different way, Jen.&nbsp; I mean the Nile Dam was an issue that President Trump put in &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don’t have anything more for you on this.<br>&nbsp;<br>Go ahead.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the President holding out hope for a bipartisan commission on January 6th, given what we&#8217;re seeing today on Capitol Hill?&nbsp; And are there any Republicans he&#8217;s reached out to personally to try to encourage them to vote for it?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I just talked to the President about a range of things.&nbsp; And certainly, he believes they should continue to move this forward, and he wants to see the commission &#8212; the bipartisan commission &#8212; passed.&nbsp; And he wants to make sure that&#8217;s law because that was a dark day in our history.&nbsp; And he thinks we should not only take a moment to recognize that, but also prevent it from happening ever in the future.<br>&nbsp;<br>Certainly, he&#8217;ll continue to convey that publicly.&nbsp; You know, I also think he recognizes that, you know, some of the people who oppose it aren’t necessarily looking for his point of view, which is very public and well known.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, can you elaborate what changed &#8212; what changed in terms of the President asking the intelligence agencies to find out the &#8212; just investigate the origins of the coronavirus?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; Let me just take you through, quickly, the timeline here.&nbsp; So, back in March, the President asked his intelligence community to do an assessment &#8212; an internal assessment, which you all know happens all the time and he is presented often &#8212; often in PDBs what those assessments look like.&nbsp; That&#8217;s what they did.&nbsp; It was presented to him a couple of weeks ago.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>In that PD- &#8212; or, following that PDB, he made clear &#8212; he asked them to see if we could declassify that information, make it available to the public.&nbsp; They came back just this week with what they would propose to be a public statement.<br>&nbsp;<br>Happening in the backdrop of that, as you all well know, was the World Health Assembly, where the Chinese made clear they were not going to engage constructively in the second stage of this &#8212; this investigation.&nbsp; And he felt that it was important, given a lot of confusion out there, to make public not only what the IC had done, but also to expand the investigation for 90 days, add more components of the federal government, including our national labs and our health and medical expertise.&nbsp; So that&#8217;s exactly what we did.<br>&nbsp;<br>So I would say it was just an &#8212; a process of declassifying and then a decision made to extend the &#8212; extend the investigation.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there anything you can say on the budget?&nbsp; Is there anything you can say on the budget &#8212; in particular, the topline reported &#8212; there was a $6 trillion topline, I believe.&nbsp; Is that an accurate report?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, let me &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>AIDE:&nbsp; We&#8217;re about to land.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Okay, let me first say that, one, we&#8217;re going to roll it out tomorrow, so stay tuned.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>But, two, it&#8217;s important to remember the President inherited $3 trillion of spending that had already been done to help get the pandemic under control.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>What the p- &#8212; budget will reflect is that he is going to continue to deliver on his priorities of getting &#8212; doing more work to get the pandemic under control, putting people back to work.&nbsp; And those proposals &#8212; the American Jobs plan, the American Rescue Plan, the American Families Plan &#8212; will put us on better financial footing over time.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So as you look at all the budget details tomorrow, I think you&#8217;ll have a better assessment.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, will China face consequences if they don&#8217;t cooperate with the COVID origins report?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We have 89 days left before we &#8212; this review is completed, and I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;re going to make any assessments before that time.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What&#8217;s the President&#8217;s plan for Memorial Day weekend?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We’ll have &#8212; we’ll have more for you on that soon.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>12:53 P.M. EDT</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Joint Base Andrews<br>Prince George&#8217;s County, Maryland</p>



<p>11:48 A.M. EDT</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. President, can you confirm that you’re going to (inaudible) trillion dollar budget?</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; I beg your pardon.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Six trillion dollar budget.&nbsp; Can you confirm the topline number?</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Well, we&#8217;ll confirm that &#8212; that&#8217;ll all be distributed.&nbsp; And one of the things I want to tell you is that I haven&#8217;t had a chance yet to go over the details of the counteroffer made by Capito.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll be &#8212; we&#8217;re going to meet sometime next week, and we&#8217;ll see if we can move that.&nbsp; And I&#8217;ll have more to say about that at the time.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What do you expect to get from your review &#8212; your 90-day review on where the origins of the coronavirus were?</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; If I knew that, I wouldn&#8217;t ask for a 90-day review.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will you pledge to release it in full?&nbsp; Will you pledge to release the report in full after 90 days?</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; That&#8217;s &#8212; unless there&#8217;s something I&#8217;m unaware of.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, what do you think of the proposal?&nbsp; Is the proposal too small for you from the Republicans?&nbsp; What is your thought on it?</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; I had a good conversation &#8212; very brief, but a good conversation &#8212; with Capito, the senator.&nbsp; And I told her we would &#8212; she&#8217;s going to contact me next week.&nbsp; I told her we have to finish this really soon.&nbsp; And there&#8217;s another Republican group that also wants it (inaudible).</p>



<p>And &#8212; but we&#8217;re going to have to close this down soon.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>We are grateful for the work of Senator Capito and her colleagues on this proposal.&nbsp;It is encouraging to see her group come forward with a substantially increased the funding level—nearing $1 trillion. We appreciate the hard work that went in to making this proposal and continuing these negotiations.&nbsp;Senator Capito told the President that her team would provide us with more details later today, and we look forward to getting that information. At first review, we note several constructive additions to the group’s previous proposals, including on roads, bridges and rail. At the same time, we remain concerned that their plan still provides no substantial new funds for critical job-creating needs, such as fixing our veterans’ hospitals, building modern rail systems, repairing our transit systems, removing&nbsp;dangerous lead pipes, and powering America’s leadership in a job-creating clean energy economy, among other things.&nbsp;Lastly, we are concerned that the proposal on how to pay for the plan remains unclear: we are worried that major cuts in COVID relief funds could imperil pending aid to small businesses, restaurants and rural hospitals using this money to get back on their feet after the crush of the pandemic.</p>



<p>As for the path forward, the President called Senator Capito thank her for the proposal, and to tell her that he would follow-up after getting additional detail. We are also continuing to explore other proposals that we hope will emerge. Though there are no votes in Congress next week, we will work actively with members of the House and Senate next week, so that there is a clear direction on how to advance much needed jobs legislation when Congress resumes legislative business during the week of June 7.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">James S. Brady Press Briefing Room</p>



<p>1:29 P.M. EDT<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Hi, everybody.&nbsp; Okay, good to see everyone.&nbsp; I have a couple of things for you guys at the top.&nbsp;<br><br>Yesterday, we made history: Kristen Clarke was confirmed with at &#8212; with &#8212; as the first woman and first woman of color to lead the Civil Rights Division at the Department of Justice.&nbsp; And Chiquita Brooks-LaSure became the first Black person to be confirmed as Administrator for the Centers for Medical &#8212; Medicare and Medicaid Services.<br><br>Kristen’s career was launched in the office that she now leads.&nbsp; She personally prosecuted crimes based on hatred and bigotry, human trafficking, domestic violence, and sexual assault.&nbsp; She has served at two of the nation’s oldest civil rights organizations, where she worked on everything from voting rights to equal education and employment.&nbsp; At the Department of Justice, she will continue advancing civil rights progress, including on police reform.<br><br>Chiquita is a lifelong public servant who has worked at OMB, on Capitol Hill, at HHS, and at CMS where she helped implement the Affordable Care Act.&nbsp; Chiquita brings a wealth of knowledge to CMS, where she will work to strengthen Medicare and Medicaid, bring down healthcare costs for American families, and advance health equity in communities across the country.&nbsp;<br><br>The President was proud to nominate Kristen and Chiquita for these positions, thanks the Senate for their bipartisan confirmation, and is honored to have them serve in these key leadership positions.  <br><br>As you all saw yesterday, we announced that next Tuesday, June 1st, the President will travel to Tulsa, Oklahoma, and deliver remarks to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Black Wall Street Massacre.<br><br>While there, he will meet with surviving members of the community now between the ages of 107 to &#8212; 101 to 107, and tour the Greenwood Culture Center.&nbsp; We’ll have additional details as we get closer to Tuesday.<br><br>As you all know, President Biden believes affordable, safe housing is the foundation upon which families build their lives.&nbsp; And he knows that stable housing will remain out of reach for tens of millions of Americans even after COVID-19 pandemic and economic crises come to an end.&nbsp;<br><br>Across the country, there is a 300,000-unit gap in annual housing supply, 11 million families pay more than half their income on rent, 3 million families with children under six reside in homes with lead paint, and thousands of working families are displaced every year as a result of extreme weather fueled by climate change.&nbsp; These changes are even more severe in low-income communities and communities of color, which have been segregated, excluded, and neglected for generations.&nbsp;<br><br>Investing in housing is an essential part of President Biden’s strategy to grow strong, healthy communities in every ZIP Code.&nbsp; So, today, the administration is releasing two new factsheets highlighting some of the key housing elements of the American Jobs Plan.<br><br>The President’s plan proposes a bold $213 billion investment in America’s housing infrastructure through a number of federal programs and proposals with bipartisan support.<br><br>This investment is paired with expansion of bipartisan tax credits and incentives to lower barriers to affordable housing in more &#8212; and higher-opportunity &#8212; places across&nbsp;the country.<br><br>Together, our estimates suggest this will enable the construction and modernization of more than 2 million affordable and sustainable places to live.&nbsp; Along the way, these investments will create and sustain hundreds of thousands of good-paying union jobs, and provide employment and economic opportunities for residents of assisted housing.<br><br>As you may have seen by now, today, the President asked the intelligence community to redouble their efforts to collect and analyze information that could bring us closer to a definitive conclusion, and to report back to him in 90 days.<br><br>Back in early 2020, the President called for the CDC to get access to China to learn about the virus so we could fight it more effectively.&nbsp; Getting to bottom of the origin is this &#8212; of this pandemic will help us understand how to prepare for the next pandemic and the next one.<br><br>As we have done throughout our COVID response, we have been committed to a whole-of-government effort to ensure we’re doing everything to both understand and end this pandemic and to prevent future pandemics.&nbsp;That is why the President is asking the U- &#8212; the U.S. intelligence community, in cooperation with other elements of our government, to redouble efforts to collect and analyze information that could bring the world closer to a definitive conclusion on the origin of the virus, and deliver a report to him, again, in 90 days. &nbsp;<br><br>It will be another whole-of-government aff- &#8212; effort, as I mentioned, including work by our National Labs and other agencies.&nbsp; Importantly, we will continue to &#8212; pushing for a stronger, multilateral investigation into the origins of the virus in China.<br><br>And we will continue to press China to participate in a full, transparent, evidence-based international investigation with the needed access to get to the bottom of a virus that’s taken more than 3 million lives across the globe and, critically, to share information and lessons that will help us all prevent future pandemics.<br><br>With that, Zeke, will you take us away?<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey, Karine.&nbsp; First, on that last bit about the calls for China to cooperate with these international investigations: What are the consequences for China if it does not &#8212; if it continues its current posture, which has not been to allow for a free and independent &#8212; independ- &#8212; investigations into the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic?<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Well, right now, we&#8217;re just going to focus on the President&#8217;s announcement on the 90-day investigation &#8212; a more deeper investigation to really look at the core of how did we get here &#8212; right? &#8212; with this pandemic, and where &#8212; the origins, clearly, of COVID-19.&nbsp; And once we get to that &#8212; once we get to that conclusion, we&#8217;ll have more to share.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So &#8212; but, in terms of, you know, cooperating with the WHO investigations, there&#8217;s nothing new from the White House in terms of encouraging China or penalties for China if it does not, sort of, cooperate with the investigation going forward?<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; I &#8212; I&#8217;m not going to prejudge or, you know, make any preannouncements at this time.&nbsp; We’re going to go with the 90-day investigation and see where it takes us from there.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, on that 90-day investigation, is White House committing to making the results of that investigation public?<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Well, we&#8217;ll have more to share after the 90 days.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then a final just on this &#8212; the President&#8217;s statement noted that at least one member of the intelligence community was leaning in the direction of there being a potential for a laboratory accident involved.&nbsp; Which member of the intelligence agency &#8212; community was it?&nbsp;<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have that information to share with you right now.&nbsp; I think the most important thing is that the President has made &#8212; has made a decision to make sure that &#8212; to get to the core &#8212; right? &#8212; to really figure out where did this &#8212; where did the origin come from, to do this additional 90-day review after asking his team to look into it into March &#8212; in March.&nbsp; So he wants to take that next step.<br><br>Go ahead, Mary.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Has the President been briefed yet, this morning, on the shooting in San Jose, California?&nbsp; And any other details you can share with us &#8212; who may have briefed him?<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Excuse me.&nbsp; Just give me one second.&nbsp;<br><br>So the White House is monitoring the situation, and our hearts go out to the victims and their families.&nbsp; I know local officials have addressed this publicly.&nbsp; And there is an ongoing investigation, as we all know.&nbsp; We will continue to stay in close contact with them and o- &#8212; and offer any assistance as needed.&nbsp; We still don&#8217;t have &#8212; we still don&#8217;t know all of the details.<br><br>But that &#8212; but what&#8217;s clear, as the President has said, is that we are suffering from an epidemic of gun violence in this country, both in mass shootings and in the lives that are being taken in daily gun violence that doesn&#8217;t make national headlines.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why he has already taken an initial set of actions on gun violence that will save lives, and that&#8217;s why he&#8217;s go- &#8212; he&#8217;s calling on Congress to take action, including calling on the Senate to pass the three bills to strengthen background checks that have already cleared the House with bipartisan support and which have the overwhelming backing of the American people.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And on infrastructure, I know you&#8217;re awaiting, sort of, the Republican counterproposal here.&nbsp; Any update?&nbsp; Any more details you may have received on Republicans’ next move here?<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Look, you know, as we all know, this is &#8212; negotiations work in this really funny way: We make an offer, they make a counter, and then we counter.&nbsp; So, as you all know, we made a &#8212; we made our offer and our &#8212; and our counter, and we&#8217;re waiting to hear from Republicans, which we&#8217;re hearing will happen shortly, what their counter will be.&nbsp; This is a process.&nbsp;<br><br>We understand that this is a town that hasn&#8217;t seen a whole lot of bipartisanship over the last few years &#8212; the last four years to be exact.&nbsp; But this President is committed to trying to end that, which is why you have seen us continue to negotiate in good faith.&nbsp;<br><br>The President&#8217;s red line &#8212; the line in the sand &#8212; has been very, very clear.&nbsp; The way that he does not want to see, he does not want this to go is without any action at all.&nbsp; So inaction is that red line, and he wants to make sure that we don&#8217;t tax people who make less than 4- &#8212; $400,000 a year.&nbsp;<br><br>So we look forward to seeing what they come back with.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One more on this.&nbsp; Senator Chris Coons &#8212; obviously a close ally of the President, someone who generally has a pretty good read on things over here &#8212; he has said that he thinks the Senate could pass a trillion-dollar proposal focused more on traditional infrastructure &#8212; splitting off some of the other items that the President has called for &#8212; and doing that just with Democratic support.&nbsp; Is a trillion dollars something the President can support?&nbsp; And would he back splitting things up like this?<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Well, look, I &#8212; look, Mary, we&#8217;re still going through this negotiation process.&nbsp; We have to see what the Republicans, the senators on the Hill are going to come back with.&nbsp; And once we have, you know, their &#8212; their counteroffer, we&#8217;ll know more and what steps to take next.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Just, lastly, a bit of a personal question.<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; Yeah, sure.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your presence here today is making history.&nbsp; You&#8217;re the first Black woman to stand behind that podium speaking on behalf of the President in 30 years.&nbsp; Just wondering if you could share your reflections with us.<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Well, thank you for the question.&nbsp; You know, it&#8217;s &#8212; it&#8217;s a real honor to be standing &#8212; to just be standing here today.&nbsp; It doesn&#8217;t &#8212; you know, the &#8212; I appreciate the historic nature, I really do.&nbsp; But I believe that, you know, behind &#8212; being behind this podium, being in this room, being in this building is not about one person; it&#8217;s about, you know, what we do on behalf of the American people.&nbsp;<br><br>Clearly, the President believes in &#8220;representation matters,&#8221; and I appreciate him giving me this opportunity.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s another reason why I think we are all so proud that this is the most diverse administration in history.&nbsp;<br><br>But, again, this is not about me; this is not about any of us.&nbsp; And, you know, anytime I&#8217;m behind here &#8212; and I think you&#8217;ve heard Jen say this as well &#8212; we are going to be truthful.&nbsp; We&#8217;re going to &#8212; we&#8217;re going to be transparent.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s the way, I believe, the President would want us to communicate to the American people.&nbsp;<br><br>Thank you for the question.<br><br>Go ahead.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Karine.&nbsp; Welcome.&nbsp; The White House publicly has mostly focused on the WHO investigation into the origins. What changed from that to the President’s statement today?<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Well, you know, nothing has changed if you &#8212; if you think about it.&nbsp; As I mentioned in the readout and I&#8217;m sure you saw in the statement, the President has asked his team to look into this back in March.&nbsp; So, this is something that has been ongoing.&nbsp; We have been pretty vocal with WHO these past several months.&nbsp; And so, this is just a continuation of what the President has been focused on.&nbsp; We&#8217;re going to see what happens this next &#8212; these next 90 days.&nbsp;<br><br>As I &#8212; you know, we just read out, it was inconclusive, so we need to get to the bottom of this.&nbsp; As we all know, we&#8217;ve lost almost 600,000 Americans to COVID-19, and we have to get a better sense of the origin of COVID-19, and, also, how do we prevent the next &#8212; you know, the next pandemic.&nbsp; And so that is the focus of this &#8212; of this announcement that we put out this<br>morning &#8212; the President put out this morning.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And when it &#8212; when it comes to the IC, their conclusions, or where they land on things, hasn&#8217;t actually changed that much in the last 12 years.&nbsp; Is the President concerned that the IC does not have enough visibility, even if they&#8217;re redoubling their efforts into what actually &#8212; is there a collection problem here?<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Well, I think this is going to be the process.&nbsp; Right?&nbsp; They have 90 days to, kind of, you know, get a deeper look on &#8212; on this.&nbsp; And then we&#8217;ll have a better sense &#8212; a better sense of where to take this next.<br><br>I mean, I do want to go back for a second.&nbsp; You know, we&#8217;ve gotten this question about the origins, and we&#8217;ve been pretty vocal.&nbsp; Right?&nbsp; This administration &#8212; we have seen &#8212; we didn&#8217;t have access.&nbsp; You know, China wasn&#8217;t transparent enough.&nbsp; We have been saying that for a very long time &#8212; that China needed to provide more access to the lab, cooperate more fully with the scientific investigators &#8212; and we don&#8217;t think that they have met that standard.&nbsp;<br><br>So, we&#8217;ve been clear that sound and technic- &#8212; and sound and technically critical theory should be thoroughly eval- &#8212; evalulated [sic] &#8212; and data &#8212; before we can give a full pronouncement.&nbsp;<br><br>So, that&#8217;s the one part, right?&nbsp;&nbsp; That&#8217;s the WHO and China.&nbsp; And now the President has asked his team to do another &#8212; to do a 90-day review.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then just one quick one on infrastructure:&nbsp; Republicans have talked about repurposing COVID money as a potential payfor here.&nbsp; Does the administration think that&#8217;s feasible?&nbsp; Is that something the President is willing to consider?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; So, Phil, as you know, we have not seen the counterproposal yet.&nbsp; We&#8217;ll look forward to reviewing that.&nbsp; It seems like tomorrow that might happen.&nbsp;<br><br>But, you know, the President has been clear that his line in the sand, as I just said, is raising taxes on Americans making <s>more</s> [less] than $400,000 a year.<br><br>But we should also be clear that there are simply not hundreds of billions of dollars in COVID-relief funds available to rep- &#8212; repurpose.&nbsp; As of the end of March, about 95 percent of the $3 trillion in pre-Rescue Plan COVID relief funding has either been obligated or is for PPP, unemployment insurance, or nutria- &#8212; nutrition assistance, where the money is going out as planned to specific businesses and people.<br><br>Of the remaining 5 percent, the largest categories of unobligated balances are in the Healthcare Provider Relief Fund, funding for rural hospitals and healthcare providers, and disaster loans for small businesses.&nbsp;<br><br>So, turning to the American Rescue Plan, the legislation is working exactly as needed, delivering relief to family businesses and communities to bridge our economy, to end the pandemic, and in- &#8212; and into a strong recovery, which is what we&#8217;re working towards.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; First, on the economy and concerns about inflation: The JPMorgan CEO, Jamie Dimon, warned today that we were going to have more inflation, less productivity, and slower growth if future federal spending, administration spending isn&#8217;t done productively.<br><br>The federal government &#8212; not historically known for efficiency.&nbsp; So, can you guarantee there&#8217;s not going to be any waste in the possibly $4 trillion more of spending in the next couple months?&nbsp;<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; So, you &#8212; so let me, first, step back for a second when &#8212; when we think about the inflation, when we think about where we are currently.<br><br>Look, the President plan &#8212; plan is &#8212; the President&#8217;s plan is working.&nbsp; We are growing the economy from the bottom up and the middle out faster than any time in the last 40 years.&nbsp; We&#8217;re creating an average of 500,000 jobs a month, up from 60,000 a month before he took office &#8212; before this President took office.&nbsp; And if you look at unemployment insurance claims, they are down.&nbsp; And Americans have much-needed money in their pockets thanks to the American Rescue Plan.&nbsp;<br><br>So we&#8217;re going in the right trajectory, right?&nbsp; We&#8217;re looking at the trend, and the trend is going in the right way.&nbsp; And, you know, this is a President who understands about making sure that we&#8217;re not wasteful &#8212; right? &#8212; making sure that &#8212; he was the &#8212; when we think about when he was a Vice President, he overlooked that stimulus recovery package back then.&nbsp; And so, he made sure there was no &#8212; no corruption and no waste.&nbsp; And so, he understands how this all works, and he has a team that will be on top of this as well.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I know that one of the big things for him is not to raise taxes on anybody that makes less than $400,000 a year.&nbsp; But if there is inflation because of wasteful spending or any other reason and everything is more expensive for everybody, is there concern that that could be a tax on the poor effectively?<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; I just want to make &#8212; be really clear about the American Jobs Plan and the American Families Plan proposal.&nbsp; Look, both of those plans will create job opportunities for all Americans, rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, invest in research and development, and educate our children, and combat climate change.<br><br>So, these plans that we&#8217;re talking about is actually an investment in our country, an investment in people, an investment in families that we need &#8212; that we have long needed, even before we saw what the pandemic has done to everyday Americans.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then just last one: On COVID-19 origins, if it turns out that COVID-19 originated from some sort of a lab accident in China &#8212; which, the President now says, one element of the intel community thinks is possible &#8212; would the President seek to punish China?<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; I &#8212; we&#8217;re not going to go there just yet.&nbsp; We have to go through the 90-day review.&nbsp; And once we have the 90-day review, we&#8217;ll be able to reassess.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But just on a 30- &#8212; just to take a step back: Anything that kills 591,116 Americans, is that something &#8212; if another nation either was responsible or knew more than they were letting on &#8212; like you said, they weren&#8217;t letting the inspectors in and that hurt the overall investigation forever &#8212; what would the President do?&nbsp; Would he do anything?<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; I mean, he&#8217;s doing something right now.&nbsp; He&#8217;s been &#8212; he asked his team, back in March &#8212; right? &#8212; to do &#8212; to do this &#8212; to look into this &#8212; look into the origins of COVID-19.<br><br>This is incredibly important, like his statement says.&nbsp; We need to find out how &#8212; where the COVID-19 originated from.&nbsp; So this Pr- &#8212; the President has been very clear.&nbsp; He actually, you know, spoke out about this back in 2020.&nbsp; So, this is not the first time we&#8217;ve heard his voice, his concern about the origins of COVID-19.<br><br>So, we&#8217;re just taking the next step.&nbsp; I&#8217;m just not going to prejudge.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not going to make a statement until, you know &#8212; until we know what happens after this 90-day review.&nbsp;<br><br>Thanks, Peter.<br><br>Another Peter.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karine, welcome.<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; (Laughs.)&nbsp; Hey.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the opening statement, we received a statement on the origins of COVID-19 from the President where he said, among other things, that this report may include specific questions for China.&nbsp;<br><br>Given China&#8217;s lack of transparency as it relates to the WHO Joint Study, why does President Biden think that China would answer the questions that the U.S. wants as it relates to the origin of COVID-19?<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Look, the COVID-19 pandemic has taken, I think, 1.3 million lives globally; 600,000 American lives, about.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s imperative that we get to the bottom of just where the pandemic originated &#8212; not just for the purposes of understanding this pandemic, but the pandemics to come, as I&#8217;ve already, kind of, alluded to.&nbsp;<br><br>And so this is something that we&#8217;re going to, you know, continue to have conversations on.&nbsp; This is a global effort.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not just United States alone as we&#8217;re working with the WHO.&nbsp; This is our process here with the 90-day &#8212; that I just mentioned &#8212; review.&nbsp; But we&#8217;re just going to continue to work with WHO, and &#8212; and WHO is going to continue to &#8212; to work with China on this.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I understand why we want it to get done, but why do we think that China would cooperate?<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; You know, this is &#8212; this is something that you have to ask the Chinese government, right?&nbsp; This is something that should be impor- &#8212; it should &#8212; should matter to them &#8212;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Has the President &#8212;<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; &#8212; but this is a question for them, as well.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Has the President specifically asked or made this ask of President Xi of China for their cooperation in this effort?<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; I’m not &#8212; I’m not going to go into details of private conversation that the President may have &#8212; may have had with President Xi.&nbsp; All I can say today is that we&#8217;re going to do this 90-day review, and this is what the President asked for, and we&#8217;ll see where it takes us.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If not the President, has the White House made this ask of the Chinese government more broadly?<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Again, I don’t have anything &#8212; anything to preview for you on that or to read out.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me ask you about Belarus, if I can, very quickly.<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Yeah.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The President said yesterday &#8212; I think his specific language was that sanctions &#8212; it’s &#8220;in play,” he said of sanctions.&nbsp; Has the White House, this administration made any final decisions about possible sanctions against Belarus?<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; The President, as we said yesterday as well, he asked his team to look into it and come up with a &#8212; kind of, a menu of options on how to move forward. So we don&#8217;t have anything yet to &#8212; to read out on that.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last item.&nbsp; I&#8217;m just following up on the awful tragedy that&#8217;s &#8212; we&#8217;re still learning more details about in San Jose, California, right now.&nbsp; You said what the President is doing broadly in an effort and what he&#8217;s been pushing Congress on.&nbsp; Are there any Republican lawmakers in particular that he&#8217;s reaching out to?&nbsp; And what specifically is he doing in terms of that effort now to try to push this along, given great frustration that it appears stalled?&nbsp; Any broad gun reforms?<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; As you know, as I laid out, the President made some &#8212; you know, some historic proposal plans of his DOJ just about a month &#8212; a month and a half ago, which is the most &#8212; you know, which is, kind of, historic, when you think about what Presidents have done in the past when it comes to dealing with gun violence prevention.&nbsp;<br><br>You know, the President talks to many Republicans and Democrats on the Hill.&nbsp; As you &#8212; as you know, he was &#8212; he was a senator for 36 years, a Vice President for 8 years.&nbsp; He has a lot of close relationships.&nbsp; They talk about an array of issues.&nbsp; And so, I don&#8217;t have any specific conversation to read out to you about this particular issue, but he continues to call on Congress to move on getting &#8212; getting gun reform done.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Go ahead, Trevor.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; So there was a letter from 15 states to your Climate Envoy John Kerry this week.&nbsp; And in that letter, they expressed issues with Kerry pushing banks to divest from fossil fuel companies.&nbsp; And they said that they would be pushing back on that.&nbsp; Do you &#8212; I mean, is that going to hurt your strategy?&nbsp; Do you have any comment about that letter?&nbsp; Any reaction to it?<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; I have not seen this letter.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have a &#8212; I don&#8217;t have a comment for you right now, but I&#8217;m happy to go back and talk to the team and get back to you on that specific letter.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, just on a separate issue: The President spoke with Egypt&#8217;s President Sisi on Monday.&nbsp; And in your readout of that call, you said that President Biden underscored the importance of a constructive dialogue on human rights in Egypt.&nbsp;<br><br>Could you talk a little bit about exactly what dialogue Biden is having with Sisi about human rights in Egypt?&nbsp; And will it go beyond talk?<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; So I have to tell you: I don’t have any more to read out from that specific conversation from the readout.&nbsp; I’m going to let the readout sit for itself.&nbsp; But I don’t have any more specifics on that particular human rights issue.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And just anything to preview about what you &#8212; how you plan to approach human rights?&nbsp; I mean, you have a budget coming out tomorrow that has foreign aid.&nbsp; You &#8212; you know, you have a lot of leverage with governments like Eqypt, as we saw with Suez &#8212;<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Yeah.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; as we saw with Gaza.&nbsp; Is there scope for the White House to put pressure on (inaudible)?<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Well, as you can imagine, our &#8212; you know, our &#8212; one of the things that the President really puts front and center is his relationships &#8212; his deep, long relationships with many of the leaders, clearly, across the globe.&nbsp; He has had decades of experience in foreign policy.&nbsp;<br><br>And so one of the things that he truly believes in, as it comes to how we&#8217;re moving forward with foreign policy, is diplomacy and making sure that we&#8217;re having those critical important conversation.&nbsp;<br><br>Those type of conversation is probably best, as you can imagine, to have it quietly, to have it behind the scenes, and to just to continue to talk about our values and what&#8217;s important to this country and how we see us moving forward when we talk about &#8212; especially something like humanitarian issues.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Go ahead, Weijia.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karine, thank you.&nbsp; It’s great to see you here.<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Good to see you.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I’m trying to get more clarity on the timing of the President’s statement today on the COVID-19 origins.&nbsp; He said that he received the report earlier this month about the origins and asked for additional follow-up.&nbsp; Did that follow-up include the current position of the IC?&nbsp; Or, in other words, when did the President first learn about the IC’s current position that they don&#8217;t have enough information to say if it was the animal host that caused this or a lab accident?<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Well, I &#8212; from just his readout, it said that he learned about it a month ago.&nbsp; So I don’t have more to read out than that.<br><br>You know, one of the reasons that we&#8217;re doing it now is because classified information takes time to declassify.&nbsp; And so that is a process that takes some time.&nbsp; And so, now we are &#8212; we are sharing that information with you all.<br><br>But just, you know, it was a month ago that he got the inf- &#8212; that he got the readout from the IC.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does it have anything to do with those reports that three researchers in the Wuhan lab were hospitalized in November 2019?<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; No, I mean, this is something that the President has been working on for some time &#8212; right? &#8212; as I mention in the readout, as we put out in the statement.&nbsp; And this is something that the President called out back in 2020 &#8212; early 2020.&nbsp; So this is something &#8212; this is an issue that has been at top of mind and that he wanted to dig into and make sure that we really get to the bottom of how we got here.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I guess I’m just trying to understand if there&#8217;s new evidence that emerged or a new posture from the IC, because medical experts, including Dr. Fauci, have long said that it&#8217;s highly likely that the virus came from an animal-to-human transmission.&nbsp; So what changed that led to today?<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Well, the readout basically said it was inconclusive.&nbsp; Right?&nbsp; That we needed to do some &#8212; needed more time to get to &#8212; to get to a better answer.<br><br>So, this is why we&#8217;re doing a 90-day review to get a better sense of where do we take this next.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What does &#8220;redoubling&#8221; mean?&nbsp; What more can the intelligence community be doing that they’re not already doing?<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Well, I think, you know, we’ve talked about making sure that we are getting the data &#8212; right? &#8212; from China.&nbsp; Right?&nbsp; Making sure that we&#8217;re getting more information so we can &#8212; we can &#8212;<br><br>You know, it&#8217;s hard to prejudge these things.&nbsp; Right?&nbsp; It&#8217;s hard to make pronouncements of something when you don&#8217;t have all the information that you need.&nbsp;<br><br>So this is going to take some time.&nbsp; This is going to continue to work with the WH- &#8212; the WHO as well.&nbsp; These are not mutually exclusive; these are happening at the same time.&nbsp; So it&#8217;s going to take more collaboration and more conversations as well.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; And just one quick one on Belarus.&nbsp; Roman Protasevich&#8217;s mother has issued an urgent plea to world leaders to help free her son, saying, &#8220;Please save him.&nbsp; They&#8217;re going to kill him in there.&#8221;&nbsp; Is there anything that President Biden can do to help secure his release?&nbsp; And has he communicated yet with President Lukashenko?<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Well, one thing &#8212; I don&#8217;t have a call to read out on your second question.&nbsp; But, you know, the President, as I mentioned, has asked his team for options.&nbsp; They are working through them now.&nbsp; He spoke a little bit about it yesterday, as I think Peter just mentioned.&nbsp;<br><br>Look, the Europeans are leading on this.&nbsp; This was a flight that was between European capitals.&nbsp; There were Americans on this flight, clearly, as well.&nbsp; And we are very concerned.&nbsp;<br><br>The President condemned it, and there will be more &#8212; more to come.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks so much.<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; No problem.&nbsp; Thanks, Weijia.<br><br>Go ahead, Mario.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Karine.&nbsp; Congratulations again on being at the podium.<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Thank you.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another question on COVID.&nbsp; The language that you all use specifically mentioned an &#8220;accident.&#8221;&nbsp; Does that mean that you&#8217;ve ruled out &#8212; or the IC has ruled out that it was deliberate or not an accident?<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; We haven&#8217;t ruled out anything yet.&nbsp; But, again, we&#8217;re going to go through this &#8212; you know, this redoubling down of another &#8212; of a 90-day review, and we&#8217;ll have more to share.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, what makes the President confident that the IC community &#8212; the intelligence community, rather, can come up with more or better evidence in the next 90 days, given it’s been working on this for the better part of the past year?<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Well &#8212; well, you know, he asked them to, again, double down, as you just mentioned, and dig in and see if we can get more data, more information.&nbsp;<br><br>There&#8217;s not much more I can say about what, you know, our intelligence community is doing.&nbsp; We&#8217;re going to let them do this 90-day review and we&#8217;ll see where we are at the end of 90 days.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the last couple &#8212; just one more on China.&nbsp; The Chinese have indicated that they&#8217;d like to see some of the tariffs rolled back before they engage in discussions with the U.S. Trade Representative.&nbsp; Is that something that the administration is willing to make concessions to facilitate those talks?<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have anything to share about the tariffs and trade &#8212; that we&#8217;re &#8212; that we&#8217;re &#8212; in conversations that we&#8217;re currently having right now.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And final question, domestically: The President, of course, met with the Floyd family yesterday.&nbsp; How does his meeting change the White House&#8217;s strategy toward getting police reform passed?<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; I&#8217;m so sorry, can you say that last part?&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t hear it.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The President met with the Floyd family yesterday.<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How does that meeting, if in any way, impact the President&#8217;s strategy toward getting the George Floyd Policing in Justice Act [sic] passed?<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Yeah, so, as you mentioned, the &#8212; you know, his meeting with the Floyd family yesterday &#8212; this is deeply personal to the President.&nbsp; Over the last year, he&#8217;s gotten to know this remarkable family.&nbsp; This is a President that knows about loss, personally, as we all know.&nbsp; And he has connected with them on a very personal level not just as President and a grieving &#8212; not just as a President and a grieving family, but on a far more personal level.<br><br>He has been particularly taken by Gianna, George&#8217;s younger daughter, who was here as well.&nbsp; He met her before the funeral last year of Ju- &#8212; I think that &#8212; I believe that was June 8th &#8212; and has kept her close to his heart ever since.<br><br>And, you know, she &#8212; he has talked about her famously saying that her father changed the world.&nbsp; And the President has not only told her she is correct, but he is committed to doing everything in his power to make it so.&nbsp; He told her this at the funeral last year, and he reiterated his &#8212; his commitment to that after the verdict and again yesterday when they met here at the White House.&nbsp;<br><br>So, when it comes to police reform, this is a priority for this President.&nbsp; He said it in his speech &#8212; his joint speech &#8212; joint &#8212; his speech &#8212; joint speech in Congress &#8212; right? &#8212; his joint Congress speech.&nbsp; And &#8212; and he&#8217;s going to continue to work on this today, tomorrow, and every day.&nbsp;<br><br>He is very pleased to see and heartened to see the bipartisanship of negotiators on the Hill.&nbsp; This is Senators Scott and Booker, and also Congresswoman Bass.&nbsp; He wants to give them the space &#8212; right? &#8212; to work on this.&nbsp; They have only been positive about the direction that the police reform is &#8211;bill is going &#8212; is headed to.&nbsp;<br><br>And so, you know, he wants to continue to work with them but also give them the space to negotiate.&nbsp; And so this is a &#8212; again, a top priority.&nbsp; He wants to see the George Floyd Act be signed into law.<br><br>Go ahead, Michael.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey, Karine.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Welcome.&nbsp; I wanted to follow up a little bit on Phil&#8217;s question about what had changed on the COVID &#8212; on the China lab situation and some of the other questions as well.&nbsp; It seems to me, despite your response to Phil, that it&#8217;s clear that at least two things have changed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Right?&nbsp;<br><br>One is that: Jen spent much of the last week &#8212; in response to these questions &#8212; focusing entirely on international investigations, led by the WHO, and dismissing the idea raised by a lot of us in the room about, &#8220;Why not have the United States conduct its own investigation?&#8221;&nbsp; And she continually referred back to the WHO as the proper place for this.&nbsp; So it seems like it has &#8212; there has been a change.&nbsp;<br><br>There also seems like there&#8217;s been a change in the President&#8217;s view of the possibility of a lab accident. &nbsp;I mean, this &#8212; the statement seems to elevate that possibility and give it more credence.&nbsp; At least, you know, not saying that it &#8212; that it’s certain, but that it at least deserves &#8212; has the credence that deserves a, kind of, full investigation.&nbsp;<br><br>And so, I guess &#8212; trying to get at the question some others have asked &#8212; is like: What has changed in those two things?&nbsp; Why &#8212; what was it that brought the President and this White House to a different place now than it&#8217;s been even just in the recent past few days?<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; I mean, Michael, I would say to you: This is something that was ongoing.&nbsp; Right?&nbsp; This was &#8212; this is something that has been going on since March.&nbsp; So this is not a change; this is, you know, something &#8212; like I said &#8212; that’s been ongoing.&nbsp;<br><br>What has changed is: He wants to give another 90 days to dig a little deeper, to double down &#8212; IC to double down their efforts.&nbsp; And that is what he&#8217;s asking for.&nbsp;<br><br>But, you know &#8212; I said this earlier &#8212; you know, the WHO doing their thing and the IC doing what they&#8217;re doing currently is not mutually exclusive.&nbsp; Right?&nbsp; This is something that could happen at the same time.&nbsp;<br><br>And so, you know, at the end of the day, we are committed to throwing everything we have at this pandemic, both domestically and internationally.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why we&#8217;ve been so strong at ensuring that the WHO gets what it needs for a thorough, independent investigation, and that&#8217;s why we&#8217;re also devoting U.S. resources to learn more about it.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; And I&#8217;m just &#8212; I won’t &#8212; I don’t want to beat the dead horse, and it&#8217;s not fair to ask you to answer for Jen &#8212; but, like, then why was &#8212; why was this White House so dismissive of the idea of a &#8212; of an independent &#8212; I mean, of a U.S.-led investigation &#8212;<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Yeah.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; if the President was already interested in that kind of investigation before that?&nbsp; That seems to be &#8212;<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; No, but I &#8212; I mean, Michael, I get your question.&nbsp; You know, you &#8212; you&#8217;ve been doing this longer than many of us.&nbsp; As you know, we don&#8217;t &#8212; you &#8212; we don&#8217;t speak about every &#8212; everything that&#8217;s being reviewed, you know, especially if something like this, that was actually classified.&nbsp; And it takes time to declassify something so that we can share with all of you.&nbsp; So that&#8217;s part of it as well, we&#8217;re talking about classified information.&nbsp; We&#8217;re talking about something that the inte- &#8212; intelligence community was working on, that we don&#8217;t normally, every time, put out there.&nbsp;<br><br>Thank you, Michael.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, Karine.&nbsp; Congratulations.<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Thank you.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks for being here.<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Absolutely.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have one last little question on this: How confident is the President that even without Chinese cooperation, that the U.S. can get to the bottom of this in 90 days?&nbsp;<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Well, we &#8212;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then I have a question about something else.<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; We got to keep &#8212; you know, we&#8217;re going to keep working on it.&nbsp; I mean, this is what he&#8217;s asking his intelligence community to do.&nbsp; We will review and reassess all of this in 90 days, once we get that &#8212; get that review back from the intelligence community.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I have a question about Nord Stream.&nbsp; Yesterday, the President basically said there wasn&#8217;t anything he could do; it was already completed by the time he took office.&nbsp; He said if he went ahead and imposed sanctions, it would be counterproductive to European relations, but, you know, he&#8217;s been an opponent of that pipeline.&nbsp;<br><br>But he did say, “I hope we can work on how they” &#8212; the Europeans &#8212; “handle it from this point on.”&nbsp; How does he want the Europeans to handle Nord Stream from this point on, since he has decided that there&#8217;s really nothing he can do to stop it?<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Well, I &#8212; just to step back for a second, Nord Stream was like 95 percent done.&nbsp; Right?<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right, (inaudible).<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; So the &#8212; before he even stepped in.&nbsp; And, you know, I talked earlier about diplomacy; there&#8217;s some times you have to do things in a different way.&nbsp; Right?&nbsp; We all have &#8212; you know, we have to &#8212; we have these relationships that we are rebuilding as well, especially after the last couple of years.&nbsp;<br><br>And so, this is &#8212; this is going to be a process.&nbsp; And so, like the President said, we&#8217;re going to figure out ways that we can work together.&nbsp; And that is something that is incredibly important to this President.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But what does he want from this point on?&nbsp; As he said, “I hope we can work on how they handle it from this point on.”&nbsp; What is he talking about?<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Yeah, I don&#8217;t have any specifics to share with you.&nbsp; As you can imagine, a lot of these conversation behind &#8212; happen behind closed doors.&nbsp; But I think he was trying to share his thoughts on this and where we can &#8212; you know, how he really truly wants to figure out a path forward.&nbsp;<br><br>Q Thanks, Karine.&nbsp; A follow-up on the Olympics question that came up in the briefing either yesterday or the day before: Today, a major Japanese newspaper put out an editorial calling for the cancellation of the Olympics, saying that it is not rational to hold the games this summer.&nbsp;<br><br>So, given Japan&#8217;s low vaccination rate, as well as the State Department bluntly telling Americans, “Do not travel to Japan,” is there any second guessing on the part of the administration to move forward and concern about athletes’ safety?<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Well, first, let me just be very clear: The &#8212; the trivel &#8212; the travel advisory is a advisory; it&#8217;s not a ban.&nbsp; But, you know, our positions remains we &#8212; has not changed on the Olympics.&nbsp;<br><br>You know, we respected the decision to delay the Olympics &#8212; the Games &#8212; last summer, and we understand the careful consideration that the Japanese government and the International Olympic Committee are weighing as they prepare for the Tokyo Olympics that&#8217;s just coming up right around the corner.&nbsp;<br><br>So, the Government of Japan has stressed that the public health remains the central priority as they plan to host the Games.&nbsp; Tokyo has assured us that they will keep in close contact with Washington as they &#8212; as their plans develop.&nbsp;<br><br>And the President proudly supports the U.S. athletes who are &#8212; who have trained for these games and will be competing in the best traditions, if you will, of the Olympic spirit.&nbsp; And so, America&#8217;s Olympic athletes represent the very best of our determination, diversity, and teamwork.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And just one other thing: You just mentioned, at the top of the briefing, factsheets about the economy and housing and things.&nbsp; The President is going to be in Cleveland tomorrow talking about the economy.&nbsp; What are the &#8212; what&#8217;s the thrust of his remarks tomorrow?&nbsp;<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; So, tomorrow, during a speech on the economy in Cleveland, President Biden is going to make a clear case that his economic plan is working.&nbsp;<br><br>He&#8217;ll talk about how far we&#8217;ve come as a country because of the actions we&#8217;ve taken over the last four months turning the tide on the pandemic, creating 500,000 new jobs each month on average, cutting unemployment claims by more than a third, raising wages, and leading the development world’s recovery.<br><br>And he&#8217;s going to talk about why now is the right moment to &#8212; investing in building back better for workers in places like Cleveland by making historic generational investments in foundation of our economy’s strength through the Jobs Plan and the Families Plan &#8212; investments that will create good-paying union jobs , expand economic opportunities for all Americans, and help us outcompete the rest of the world in the 21st century.&nbsp; So that&#8217;s the trip for tomorrow.<br><br>Sebastian.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you very much.&nbsp; And, yes, welcome.&nbsp; So I’m afraid &#8212; with apologies &#8212; it’s not the last COVID question.&nbsp; Is the White House satisfied with the cooperation it’s getting from China on this?&nbsp; Because, in the past, clearly it hasn&#8217;t been.&nbsp;<br><br>And if it isn&#8217;t, is the President &#8212; has he got a message to China that “I would like more cooperation.”&nbsp; Are you asking China to step up in these 90 days?&nbsp; Or is it okay?<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Well, we&#8217;ve been working, you know &#8212; speaking closely with WHO.&nbsp; Right?&nbsp; They&#8217;re the ones who are &#8212; they&#8217;re the global, kind of &#8212; the global entity bringing us all together.&nbsp; And so they&#8217;re having that direct conversation when it comes to the origins of COVID-19.<br><br>And we have been pretty clear, you know, China has not been transparent; they need to do more.&nbsp; And so, that&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve been, I think, very vocal about this &#8212; these past several months, and we’ll continue &#8212; we’ll continue to do so.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; And another question on the Olympics, as well.&nbsp; Just to put the same question a slightly different way: A large majority of the Japanese, according to the polls, are against it, and it&#8217;s pretty consistent.&nbsp; You&#8217;ve got some prominent businesses against it.&nbsp; You&#8217;ve got a large part of the medical community against it.&nbsp; And now you&#8217;ve got this newspaper, which is one of the sponsors of the Olympics, against it.&nbsp;<br><br>Is there a point at which the administration says, “Look, we just don&#8217;t want to basically offend the Japanese people, even if the government is saying, &#8216;It&#8217;s okay'&#8221;?&nbsp; Or are you just going to follow the government’s &#8212; their government’s guidance and just go along with what they say?&nbsp;<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; I mean, it really goes back to what I was saying earlier &#8212; is that, you know, we &#8212; we truly respect the decision, you know, to delay it last year.&nbsp; And &#8212; and the Government of Japan has stressed that public health remains a central priority.&nbsp;<br><br>And so that is the commitment that they made to us and to other &#8212; to other countries where their &#8212; they will have athletes attending the Olympics in just a few weeks.&nbsp; And so that &#8212; that&#8217;s &#8212; that&#8217;s pretty much where we are.&nbsp; We just &#8212; we &#8212; we really truly &#8212; you know, we trust what the Government of Japan has stated to us.&nbsp;<br><br>Yamiche.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; And congratulations, again.&nbsp;<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A question on the origins of the pandemic: The President says he has specific questions for China.&nbsp; I know that a lot of this is classified information, but can you share anything on what some of those specific questions are for China?&nbsp;<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; I can&#8217;t share the specific questions that are for &#8212;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Inaudible.)<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Because this is the intelligence community.&nbsp; They&#8217;re doing &#8212; you know, they&#8217;re doing their deep dive.&nbsp; I can&#8217;t go into that.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Some Republicans &#8212; turning to infrastructure &#8212; some Republicans are saying, including Senator Thune &#8212; are blaming White House aides for not getting a deal, saying that, in fact, White House staff is less interested in getting an infrastructure deal than the President himself.&nbsp; How concerned is the President about that?&nbsp; And has the President reached out to those senators who are saying this to say, “No, in fact, my staff and I are on the same page.”&nbsp;<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Well, this is &#8212; this is &#8212; all of this &#8212; this negotiation is being led by the President.&nbsp; If you think about the memo, the counteroffer that he put out that &#8212; last Friday &#8212; that was approved and led by the President.&nbsp;<br><br>He&#8217;s been in the room in these negotiations.&nbsp; Again, he has close personal relationships with a lot of these senators.&nbsp; This is &#8212; as we know &#8212; this is &#8212; I&#8217;ve mentioned this before &#8212; he was in Sen- &#8212; in the Senate for 36 years.&nbsp; He was the [Vice] President for eight years.&nbsp; He believes in having bipartisanship.&nbsp;<br><br>He has &#8212; in those, you know, as a VP and as &#8212; as senator, he has reached across the aisle to get things done, to get big things done.&nbsp; And so this is how he sees this moment.&nbsp; This is an infrastructure &#8212; you know, infrastructure is a bipartisan issue.&nbsp; This is something that Democrats, independents, and Republicans truly care about.&nbsp;<br><br>We&#8217;re talking about investing in our country, investing in people, investing in roads &#8212; right? &#8212; investing in bridges.&nbsp; This is something that will have a long-lasting effect, something that we haven&#8217;t done in a &#8212; in a generation.&nbsp;<br><br>So this is something that we believe &#8212; he believes, more importantly &#8212; that should have bipartisan support, and that&#8217;s what he&#8217;s &#8212; he&#8217;s going for.&nbsp; And thus far, you know, we are seeing negotiation happening.&nbsp;<br><br>We&#8217;re waiting to hear the counteroffer from senators on the other side &#8212; Republican senators.&nbsp; And so, once we get there &#8212; once we get that counteroffer, we&#8217;ll have more to share.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I ask you one about COVID and equity?&nbsp; I know there are, of course, COVID briefings, but the share of Black people who are making up the new coronavirus cases in cities like D.C. has risen sharply, and this is after the vaccine &#8212; the vaccines were widely available.<br><br>In D.C. now, 80 percent of the new COVID cases are Black people.&nbsp; How concerned is the President about that?&nbsp; And does he see that as a failure in his responsibility, specifically when it comes to the number of Black people that we’re seeing now get COVID?&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; So, it&#8217;s a great question, Yamiche.&nbsp; You know, earlier this week, Jen talked about the wartime kind of response that we&#8217;ve had to COVID-19 and the successes. We&#8217;ve actually seen some great successes on getting people vaccinated, but we still have a lot of work to do, right?&nbsp;<br><br>We have &#8212; the President made a pledge to have 70 percent of [adult] Americans, by July 4th, have at least one dose in arms; 160 million Americans fully vaccinated.&nbsp; And so that means that we have to bring everyone along.&nbsp;<br><br>And as you just iterated, you know, the President puts equity in everything that we do.&nbsp; Equity &#8212; we have a Equity Task Force.&nbsp; There’s a reason why we have it, because we want to make sure we don’t leave communities behind.&nbsp;<br><br>And so one of the things that we&#8217;re doing and we&#8217;re continuing to do is we got to meet people where they are.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why now, in many pharmacies, you can walk in and get your &#8212; get that vaccine; it is free.&nbsp; It is something that, clearly, we&#8217;re working really closely with states and local governments with on.&nbsp; We have mobile units in communities [that] do not have access to &#8212; close access to CVS or, you know, maybe don&#8217;t even have a &#8212; you know, a doctor to go to.&nbsp; So we have made it so that we are meeting people where we are.<br><br>And one thing that we have learned: The more people who get vaccinated, the more that the confidence of the vaccine &#8212; you see that number going up.<br><br>So, we do have a lot of work to do, but we also have some successes that we can point to that we can continue to replicate and continue to get out there and make sure we bring all communities along.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I could with that &#8212; with a quick follow-up.<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Yeah, absolutely.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You said that the President &#8212; and it’s true, of course, the President has put equity at all &#8212; the center of a lot of what he’s done on the pandemic.&nbsp; Of course, these numbers, though, say &#8212; tell a different story just in terms of &#8212;<br><br>Again, here in D.C., 1 in 10 &#8212; I should say 8 in 10 people in the new cases are Black people.&nbsp; What’s the disconnect there that you think &#8212; what’s failing, what’s broken, what could be happening more to prevent the numbers from going in the direction that they are?<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; I mean, look, we &#8212; as I said, we still have a lot of work to do.&nbsp; That’s very critical and important.&nbsp; And it’s alarming &#8212; those numbers.&nbsp; Right?&nbsp;<br><br>Because like I said, in order to get back to normal, we have to bring everyone along. &nbsp;All communities need to get vaccinated.&nbsp; And we have to be able to do that in a way that, like I said, we don&#8217;t leave people behind.<br><br>But I think one of the things that we are doing is making sure that we have those trusted voices on the ground, making sure we have a Community Corps &#8212; more than 6,000 people &#8212; where we have people who are in those local communities that are continuing to have those conversations with people who have hesitancy; with people who, you know, may not know or have the full information.&nbsp; And so, this is what we&#8217;re continuing to do.<br><br>And, you know, this is not lost on us.&nbsp; Right?&nbsp; Like I said, this is &#8212; those numbers are alarming, and we&#8217;re going to continue to do the work.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not done yet.&nbsp; We are not done yet.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Karine.<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Oh.&nbsp; Oh, thank you.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Inaudible.)<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Okay, I&#8217;ll take this last question.&nbsp; (Laughter.)<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karine, hi.&nbsp; Taurean Small with Spectrum News.&nbsp; Congratulations, by the way.<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Thank you.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have to start by apologizing because I’m going to ask about the COVID origins again.&nbsp; But you said you were confident &#8212; the administration is confident in U.S. investigation into this.&nbsp; But are you guys confident in the World Health Organization&#8217;s credibility?&nbsp; This statement greatly differs from the findings that the organization has put out.&nbsp; They said it was extremely unlikely that this came from a lab leak.&nbsp; Is the administration at &#8212; going to call on the World Health Organization to call on &#8212; call for a new investigation, an independent investigation?&nbsp; How confident in the results (inaudible)?<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Yeah, I mean, we’ve been very clear on that.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve been very clear with the WHO to continue to get to the bottom of this, to get the additional data that we need to figure out where the origin of COVID is from or came from.<br><br>And so this is &#8212; this is &#8212; like I said, we&#8217;ve been vocal.&nbsp; We&#8217;re going to continue working with WHO.&nbsp; We joined &#8212; rejoined the WHO once &#8212; very early on.&nbsp; And one of the reasons why we did that is to be able to hold them accountable as well.&nbsp; Right?&nbsp; This is a global institution that brings everyone together.&nbsp; And so it&#8217;s important that we get &#8212; we &#8212; it&#8217;s important that they have the information, they get the information so we know how to move forward.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One quick question on the budget: Progressives in Congress are calling on the Biden administration to slash funding to the Pentagon&#8217;s budget.&nbsp; Representative Mark Pocan, specifically, called on the President to cut about $50 billion from the defense budget because of the President&#8217;s announcement to pull troops out of Afghanistan.&nbsp; Is this something that President Biden is considering?<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; So, let me just say that we&#8217;ll be announcing and rolling out the President’s proposed budget this coming Friday, and I&#8217;m not going to get too far ahead of that.<br><br>What I will say is the President&#8217;s proposed budget will outline how he is proposing to pay for a range of the plans the President has put forward.&nbsp; And he&#8217;s clearly talked about and remains committed to his campaign pledge of pushing for a public option of prescription drugs &#8212; something he talked about in his joint session address &#8212; and other &#8212; other items, not just that one.&nbsp; But every &#8212; every entity may not be reflected in this budget.<br><br>But again, I don&#8217;t want to get ahead of the President, who will be putting out his budget on Friday.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karine, I wanted to follow up on my colleague’s question &#8212;<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Thank you, guys.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Thank you, guys.&nbsp; Thank you, guys.&nbsp;<br><br>2:21 P.M. EDT</p>
