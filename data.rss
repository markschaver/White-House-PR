<p class="has-text-align-center">Hilton Philadelphia at Penn&#8217;s Landing<br>Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</p>



<p>12:41 P.M. EST</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Please.&nbsp; Thank you very much.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Please, sit down.&nbsp; Please.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve been to enough Senate caucuses and Democratic retreats to know that when the last speaker is up, you want to get the hell out of here &#8212; (laughter) &#8212; no matter who it is.&nbsp; But thank you.<br><br>Look, folks, let me begin by saying that when I ran &#8212; and a lot of you helped me; a lot of good people ran &#8212; I made it clear I was running for three reasons, and &#8212; because I had no intention of running for office again when I left the vice presidency.&nbsp; But when I saw those folks come out of those fields down in Charlottesville, carrying torches and singing Nazi slogans and carrying swastikas, and white supremacists, I decided to get engaged.&nbsp;<br><br>The point is this: I had a message, which I didn&#8217;t consult with anybody about generating, to begin with, which was not viewed as being very saleable.&nbsp; The first was that I thought it was essential to literally restore the soul of this country &#8212; a sense of decency and honor, a sense of &#8212; a sense that you could trust one another &#8212; just restore the soul of the country, because what we were seeing was not who we are.&nbsp; And among some of our Republicans, what they&#8217;re saying is still not who we are.</p>



<p>The second thing I wanted to do that has been the essence of my whole career, from the time I ran 20 miles from here &#8212; a 29-year-old kid for the Senate &#8212; was that I wanted to rebuild the backbone of the country.&nbsp; And the backbone of the country is the working class and middle class.&nbsp; I&#8217;m so sick and tired of trickle-down.&nbsp; When the middle class does well, the poor have a way up and the wealthy do just fine.&nbsp; They do just fine.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>And third thing, which a lot of you didn&#8217;t like &#8212; I know &#8212; I thought we had to unify the country, because, ultimately, we are a democracy.&nbsp; And there needs to be &#8212; for it to work, there has to be consensus.&nbsp; In a consensus, you got to get a majority.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve not been able to do that for a lot of the important things.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why we have to continue to maintain our majority.&nbsp;<br><br>This off-year election, in my view, may be the most important off-year election in modern history.&nbsp; Because we know what happens: We know the fundamental change that shifts if we lose the House and the Senate.&nbsp; The only thing I&#8217;ll have then is a veto pen.&nbsp;<br><br>And so, folks, I want to thank Nancy for the introduction, for your friendship all these years, Nance.&nbsp; And, Paul, thank you as well.&nbsp;<br><br>And I want to thank &#8212; the extraordinary job you’ve done delivering the omnibus, just like you delivered so many critical pieces of legislation last year.<br><br>And Hakeem and Steny and Jim and Emanuel Cleaver and Pete, Congresswoman Katherine Clark and all of you out there: Let me first say that &#8212; I want to say thank you &#8212; thank you for the support you’ve provided Ukraine.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>I was on the phone today for a better part of an hour with &#8212; with Zelenskyy, who I speak to almost daily.&nbsp; The people of Ukraine have demonstrated a remarkable source of bravery and courage.&nbsp; But the security assistance that you’ve provided has been absolutely critical &#8212; critical in their defense.&nbsp;<br><br>Second, I want to thank you for showing a unified front to the world.&nbsp; When Putin unleashed his assault, he thought he could divide NATO.&nbsp; He thought he could literally divide this country, the West &#8212; the United States &#8212; in terms of the parties.&nbsp; I know a former ambassador knows that out there.&nbsp; He thought he could divide Democrats and Republicans at home.&nbsp; But he failed.&nbsp; He failed.&nbsp;<br><br>For months, the United States has worked tirelessly to keep our Allies and partners together.&nbsp; As our former ambassador &#8212; who you see on television a lot, thank God &#8212; will tell you I&#8217;ve spent literally hours and hours and hours and hours keeping the Alliance together &#8212; the EU, NATO, and all of our allies, including our Asian allies.&nbsp;<br><br>As a result, we&#8217;ve been able to ramp up our economic pressure on Putin and further isolate Russia on the global stage.<br><br>This morning, along with the G7 nations &#8212; in Germany, Canada, France, Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom &#8212; we moved &#8212; which I know you wanted to do initially &#8212; and Nancy, I drove her crazy &#8212; on most-favored-nation status &#8212; as we call it in the United States, “permanent normal trade relations” &#8212; and eliminate them.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>But, folks, I know I&#8217;ve occasionally frustrated you, but more important than us moving when we want to is making sure all of NATO is together &#8212; is together.&nbsp; They have different vulnerabilities than we do.&nbsp; Just like in the oil embargo, a lot of them could not &#8212; the only way I was &#8212; it took, I think, you know, weeks to work out.&nbsp; I said, “We&#8217;re going to block oil &#8212; Russian oil energy and energy.”&nbsp;<br><br>We consume 15 percent of it; they rely totally on it.&nbsp; Without Russian oil, they&#8217;re going to find themselves in a position where they get choked off in a way that far exceeds anything we do &#8212; anything we do.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>So it took a long time sitting with my counterparts and saying, “Look, we&#8217;re going to block oil, but I&#8217;m not going to ask you to do it.&nbsp; I&#8217;m going to say to you, ‘You do what you can.&nbsp; I&#8217;m going to explain why it&#8217;s not rational for you to do the same thing.&nbsp; In the meantime, we&#8217;re going to help you get energy through liquefied natural gas and a whole range of other things.’”<br><br>The point is: Revoking PNTR for Russia has made it harder for Russia to do business with the United States.&nbsp; But in doing it with unison with our Allies that, kept together, make up half the global economy &#8212; half of it &#8212; is a crushing blow to Russia.&nbsp;<br><br>Along with our partners and Allies, we&#8217;ve stepped up pressure on corrupt Russian billionaires.&nbsp; We&#8217;re increasing &#8212; we&#8217;re increasing coordination among the G7 countries and &#8212; to target, capture the ill-begotten gains &#8212; the yachts.&nbsp; You see some of these yachts &#8212; 450 feet long.&nbsp; No, I&#8217;m serious.&nbsp; Hundreds of millions of dollars in value. &nbsp;Their luxury apartments.&nbsp;<br><br>The totality of our economic sanctions and export controls are crushing &#8212; crushing the Russian economy.&nbsp; The ruble has lost &#8212; and I know many of you know this in detail &#8212; lost more than half its value.&nbsp; You know what the value of a ruble is versus a dollar?&nbsp; You need 200 rubles to equal 1 dollar today &#8212; 200.&nbsp;<br><br>The Moscow stock exchange is closed for a simple reason.&nbsp;&nbsp;I get asked, “Well, why is it closed?”&nbsp; Because &#8212; for the last two weeks &#8212; because the moment it opens, it will be disbanded.&nbsp; You hear me?&nbsp; It will blow up.</p>



<p>Credit-rating agencies have downgraded Russia’s government to “junk” status &#8212; “junk” status.&nbsp; And the list of private businesses and international corporations leaving Russia is growing day by day by day.<br><br>I want to be clear though: We’re going to make sure Ukraine has the weapons to defend themselves from invading Russian force.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; And we will send money and food aid to save Euro- &#8212; Ukrainian lives.<br><br>We’re going to welcome Ukrainian refugees with open arms if, in fact, they come all the way here.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; And as we provide &#8212; as we provide this support to Ukraine, we’re going to continue to stand together with our allies in Europe and send an unmistakable message that we will defend every inch of NATO territory –- every single inch &#8212; with a united, galvanized NATO.&nbsp; One movement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s why I’ve moved over 12,000 American forces along the borders with Russia &#8212; Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania, Romania, et cetera &#8212; because they move once.&nbsp; Granted, if we respond, it is World War Three, but we have a sacred obligation on NATO territory &#8212; a sacred obligation &#8212; Article 5.&nbsp; And we will not &#8212; although we will not fight the third World War in Ukraine.&nbsp; Putin’s war against Ukraine is never going to be a victory.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><s>Democrats</s>&nbsp;[Democracies] are rising to meet the moment, relying &#8212; rallying the world on the side of peace and security.&nbsp; We are showing a strength, and we’ll never falter.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>But, look, the idea &#8212; the idea that we’re going to send in offensive equipment and have planes and tanks and trains going in with American pilots and American crews, just understand &#8212; and don’t kid yourself, no matter what you all say &#8212; that’s called “World War Three.”&nbsp; Okay?&nbsp; Let’s get it straight here, guys.&nbsp; That old expression &#8212; “Don’t kid a kidder.”<br><br>Now, I’d like to speak to our broader purpose here today to remind everybody where we were a year ago, where we’ve gotten since, the direction we’re headed in.&nbsp; And all of you know that today is&nbsp;the anniversary, as Nancy said, since we passed the American Rescue Plan within the first month in office, thank God.&nbsp; Thank God you did it.</p>



<p>Was it anybody’s thought we’re going to pass a bill that’s 1 trillion 900 billion dollars?&nbsp; We’re going to do that?&nbsp; Yeah, you did it.&nbsp; I asked, and you did it.<br><br>Few pieces of legislation &#8212; no hyperbole &#8212; in American history have done more to lift this country out of a crisis than what you did.<br><br>It took about 2 million Americans before I was &#8212; before I was sworn in &#8212; 2 million Americans had been vaccinated.<br><br>Today, because of the efforts you’ve &#8212; what you’ve voted for, we have more than 215 million Americans fully vaccinated.<br><br>You all remember the lines of cars &#8212; you remember?&nbsp; Nice-looking cars, stretched for hours and hours to (inaudible) just to get a box of food.&nbsp; Well, guess what?&nbsp; Stretching those miles and miles no longer is happening.&nbsp; That box of food is not only in the table &#8212; in the trunk.&nbsp; Because of that law, 41 million people put food on their table and are putting it on the table who wouldn’t have been able to.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>Because of that law, we helped to keep a roof over 4 million people’s heads who were about to be evicted.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; And we gave families what my dad used to call “just a little breathing room.”&nbsp; Just a little bit of breathing room<em>.</em></p>



<p>Because we took action, we created &#8212; we created&nbsp;6.7 million jobs last year &#8212; more than any other time in American history.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>And we haven’t stopped.&nbsp; Last month, we created over 7- &#8212; 678,000 jobs in February to get us well over 7 million jobs.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>Unemployment is down [to] 3.8 percent.&nbsp; The economy grew 5.7 percent &#8212; the best economic growth in the last four decades.&nbsp; And the leading financial firm on Wall Street, Moody’s, estimates that because of the Rescue Plan, 4 million more jobs were created, unemployment is 2 percent lower than it would have been and &#8212; had we failed to act.&nbsp; And it didn’t cause the inflation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Look,&nbsp;there’s more to the story than that.&nbsp; Many of you remember when we went through the last financial crisis in 2008.&nbsp; I had the dubious distinction of the President standing before all of you and said, “And Sheriff Joe is going take care of the Recovery Act.”&nbsp; (Laughter.) &nbsp;Well, guess what?&nbsp; The economy recovered, but underneath the recovery, just like the re- &#8212; like every other recovery in our history, there was a lot of pain &#8212; a lot of pain.<br><br>Republicans in Congress refused to give President Obama the additional Recovery funds he asked for.&nbsp; And the truth is, a lot of folks never got back on their feet.&nbsp; A whole lot of young people saw their futures dimmed, diminished.&nbsp; They didn’t get back on track.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>And what’s &#8212; economists called the “economic scarring” that occurred as a consequence of that recession: the chronic pain when an economy comes back but some of the folks who were left behind were left behind almost permanently, trapped in long-term unemployment, evictions and foreclosures.<br><br>Study after study showed that when you’re stuck in that cycle, it has the worst impact on your emotional health and that of your children and your family members that you can imagine.&nbsp; And that’s serious.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So when I came to office in the midst of this crisis, I was determined not to let that happen.&nbsp; Together, we made the choice to ask for all that we needed, to leave nobody behind, to minimize the pain and the hopelessness and the despair that so many had just lost their jobs, lost everything through no fault of their own.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>And look what happened.&nbsp; It isn’t just that the unemployment rate has dropped at a record pace.&nbsp;&nbsp;We’ve also seen the biggest drop in long-term unemployment ever recorded in American history.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Nearly 2.5 million Americans have got to break out of that cycle of long-term unemployment.<br><br>We’ve seen the most significant drop in Black and Hispanic unemployment ever recorded.&nbsp; Black [un]employment fell by more than 30 percent.&nbsp; Hispanic fell &#8212; Hispanic employment &#8212; unemployment fell by 9 percent to 4.4 percent.<br><br>We’ve seen the lowest child poverty rate ever recorded &#8212; 40 percent decline in child poverty.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>The lowest num- &#8212; the lower number of harm forcl- &#8212; home foreclosures ever recorded, down to less than a third of what they were we were before the pandemic.<br><br>Record low credit card delinquencies because families had money in their pockets.<br><br>The list goes on.&nbsp; We’ve got a long way to go, though.&nbsp; I’m not saying we’re over; we’re just getting going.&nbsp; And a lot of work to do.&nbsp; But never forget what we’ve accomplished together so far.</p>



<p>And, by the way, the American people just trying to stay above water don’t understand this.&nbsp; You tell them what the American Recovery Act was, and they look at you like, “What<br>are you talking about?”&nbsp; Understandably.&nbsp; They’re like my family: mom, dad, four kids, grandpop living in the house in a three-bedroom split-level home.&nbsp; Just every single day figuring out how you put enough food on the table even when things are okay.<br><br>Well &#8212; and on this one anniversary of the American Rescue Plan, let&#8217;s be clear: We did it alone, without one single, solitary Republican vote.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>The American economy was flat on its back.&nbsp; It was the Democrats &#8212; it was you that brought us back.&nbsp; And you didn&#8217;t stop there.&nbsp; You invested in America.<br><br>In fact, you passed the biggest investment of rebuilding the nation in history.&nbsp; Now, it&#8217;s true we got some Republicans friends &#8212; to help on their for &#8212; on the Recovery &#8212; on &#8212; excuse me, on the Infrastructure Act.&nbsp; But we&#8217;re talking how many in the House &#8212; 12, 13, 14, or something?&nbsp; Whatever it was.<br><br>PARTICIPANT:&nbsp; Thirteen!<br><br>PARTICIPANT:&nbsp; Thirteen.<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Thirteen.&nbsp; I mean, come on.&nbsp; I mean, I was happy for them, don’t get me wrong.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; And then every one of them got attacked.&nbsp;<br><br>Look, have &#8212; but have you noticed that every new bridge, every trench dug put in the &#8212; to take out lead pipes, every trench dug, there&#8217;s a Republican standing there saying, “This is a great thing.”&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Wonderful.&nbsp; We did it.&nbsp; Even Mitch McConnell, for God&#8217;s sake.<br><br>You know, as we say in my outfit, “Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.&nbsp; There has been so much since our last confession.”<br><br>Look, the simple fact is: This Infrastructure Bill is going to transform America.&nbsp; I mean, not figuratively, literally transform America.&nbsp; And it’s already starting.&nbsp;<br><br>Instead of having “Infrastructure Week,” we have an “Infrastructure Decade” we voted for.&nbsp; Okay?&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>We got 4,000 projects all across the country, including 1,500 bridges in disrepair that are starting to be repaired this year.&nbsp; This year.&nbsp; People back home need to know what’s happening.<br><br>By the way, where&#8217;s my Pittsburgh group?&nbsp; Where are you?&nbsp; They&#8217;re in Pittsburgh.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Anyway, I just out &#8212; was out in Pittsburgh.&nbsp; That &#8212; that bridge &#8212; you saw that bridge; it was devastating.&nbsp; I stood there about that bridge that had gone down an hour before I got there.&nbsp; Over a hundred-foot fall.&nbsp; Only a couple folks on that bridge.&nbsp; And if it had been two hours later, school buses would have been filled, children would have died.&nbsp; I mean, it was &#8212; you saw the pictures in the paper.&nbsp; You ought to stand there and lean over and look at it.<br><br>Look, we need to tell the American people this law is going to create millions of jobs rebuilding roads and bridges, airports and ports, Internet, and a whole range of other things.&nbsp; Because that&#8217;s what it’s going to do.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>And that&#8217;s why &#8212; I&#8217;m not going to get into it right now, but that&#8217;s where we have to make sure we have our education system up and running so we can produce the kind of workers we need, et cetera.<br><br>But it&#8217;s going to start to get rid of the poisonous lead pipes as well so our kids and families can drink clean water.&nbsp; There&#8217;s 10 million homes with lead pipes in America.&nbsp; And some of you on the Health Committee know the incredible studies done on the impact of lead on the brain of children and children&#8217;s development.&nbsp; Four hundred thousand schools.<br><br>We’re going to invest $65 billion to deliver affordable high-speed Internet everywhere in America: urban, suburban, Tribal, city.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br><br>And, by the way, we can&#8217;t be &#8212; this is the United States of America.&nbsp; We can&#8217;t be the country where for a mom to get her kid on the Internet to be able to do their homework has to pull into a McDonald&#8217;s parking lot.&nbsp; I mean, for real, that’s what was happening.&nbsp;<br><br>This law is going to put an end to all of that.&nbsp; It’s going to put people in a much different position to be able to determine their own &#8212; their own judgments about when to sell their cattle, when they should &#8212; I just &#8212; just &#8212; we’re going to change things.&nbsp;<br><br>But look, we all know that despite the progress we’ve made, families are still struggling.&nbsp; They’re struggling with higher prices.<br><br>As I said, I grew up in a family &#8212; when the price of gas went up, everybody felt it.&nbsp; You talked about it.&nbsp; It mattered.&nbsp; It mattered.<br><br>But let&#8217;s be absolutely clear about why prices are so high right now.&nbsp; They’re very high for two reasons, notwithstanding what the Republicans say: COVID, number one.&nbsp; What happened was, the glo- &#8212; the way the global economy works: If a factory in Taiwan makes computer chips shuts down because of COVID, it causes a ripple effect that can slow down the manufacturing in Detroit, which it did.&nbsp; One hitch can hold up everything.<br><br>Because of the pandemic, we’ve had disruptions in our supply chain materials and important materials.<br><br>At the same time, the strength and speed of our economic recovery and families making more money still kept up.&nbsp; So here you had an unusual situation that, during a pandemic, people had money to spend.&nbsp; But what they didn’t do is they didn’t want &#8212; they didn’t want to go to restaurants.&nbsp; They didn’t want to go out and go on vacations.&nbsp; They didn’t spend money on leisure activities.&nbsp; So they wanted to spend it on other things &#8212; on hard goods, home improvements, televisions, additions to their homes &#8212; the very products that slowed down by disruptions in the supply chain, because there weren’t people cutting two-by-fours.&nbsp; Because of COVID, they were shut down.&nbsp;<br><br>I could go on a list.&nbsp; You all know this.&nbsp; I’m preaching to the choir here.&nbsp;<br><br>So what happened?&nbsp; Prices went up exponentially.&nbsp;<br><br>Just take a look at automobiles last year.&nbsp; One third of all the inflation in America last year was because of the price of automobiles.&nbsp; People had the money to buy automobiles, finally.&nbsp; But because the companies couldn’t get semiconductors, they couldn’t make the automobiles.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>The result: The price of automobiles skyrocketed.&nbsp;<br><br>And used cars &#8212; the reason used cars went up is because when the &#8212; when the COVID hit and the leisure industry shut down, the rental cars sold all their stock.&nbsp; So people were in real trouble.&nbsp;<br><br>The second big reason for inflation is Vladimir Putin.&nbsp; From the moment he put his over 150,000 troops on the Ukrainian border, the price of gasoline&nbsp;<s>in</s>&nbsp;[since] January went up 75 cents.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Then Putin began amassing troops along the border.&nbsp; And guess what?&nbsp; The world took notice.&nbsp; And those of you who work in the business know that the market anticipated and pricing went up more.&nbsp; And then Putin invaded.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Make no mistake, inflation is largely the fault of Putin.&nbsp; I love &#8212; you know, the Republicans are saying it’s “Biden&#8217;s gas pipeline.”&nbsp; “Biden said he&#8217;s going to stop the Keystone Pipeline…” &#8212; and I did &#8212; “…and that&#8217;s the reason prices went up.”</p>



<p>Folks, let&#8217;s get something straight here: The Keystone Pipeline was two years away.&nbsp; It had been 2 percent finished.&nbsp; Give me a break.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Give me a break.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Headline fact checker in the New York Times: “Republicans Wrongly Blame Biden for Rising Gas Prices.”&nbsp; And it goes on to explain why gas prices are so high.</p>



<p>Washington Post op-ed by &#8212; by Dana Milbank, “Opinion: Biden Heeded Republicans’ Plea to Ban Russian Oil.&nbsp; They Pounced.”&nbsp; And it goes on to talk about why it’s got &#8212; don’t let anybody tell you anything you did supporting the idea that we block Russian oil coming into the country, which is g- &#8212; and I said at the time prices are going to go up for gasoline.&nbsp; It wasn&#8217;t anything we did.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, by the way, you&#8217;re in a situation right now where if you take a look, the idea can we &#8212; “can we pump more oil?”&nbsp; There are now &#8212; now five &#8212; there are 172 gas and oil rigs running.&nbsp; Now we have &#8212; there were 519 in operation before this all began.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>But guess what?&nbsp; They have over 7,000 permits to dig oil if they want.&nbsp; Why aren&#8217;t they out pumping oil?&nbsp; Why aren’t they out pumping oil?&nbsp; Because they&#8217;ve said and they’re very clear &#8212; Wall Street bankers have made it very clear &#8212; not a joke, check it out.&nbsp; And I recommend these two articles to you, just as a little bit of a primer.&nbsp; You probably already know it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>What&#8217;s happened?&nbsp; Well, the oil companies and executives, they don&#8217;t want to pump more oil, although they have every capacity to do so.&nbsp; Nothing is slowing them up from doing it if they want to.</p>



<p>Why?&nbsp; Rather than spend the profits on the increased price of gasoline, they would rather take those profits and buy back stock &#8212; buy back their own stock, rather than take that money and invest it in pumping new oil.&nbsp; Not a joke.&nbsp; Not a joke.</p>



<p>So don&#8217;t tell me gas prices rose because I&#8217;ve slowed down the American energy production.&nbsp; In my first year in office, American production grew by 9.7 million barrels a day to 11.6 million while we still made a major, major effort to deal with global warming and changing the way in which we shift to renewable &#8212; renewable energy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>And don&#8217;t tell me gas prices rose because of the American Rescue Plan.&nbsp; The San Francisco Reserve &#8212; Federal Reserve analyzed this and other outfits confirm: The Rescue Plan contributed to 0.3 percent of inflation &#8212; 0.3 inflation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>They’re the facts.&nbsp; Democrats didn&#8217;t cause this problem.&nbsp; Vladimir Putin did.<br><br>And we&#8217;re &#8212; and we are working on it to fix it.&nbsp; Because of the work we did, this country is vaccinated and start building the economy from the bottom up in the middle out. Something incredible is happening.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We&#8217;re seeing a manufacturing revival I don&#8217;t think even those of you from the Midwest thought would occur.&nbsp; The pride that comes from stamping products “Made in America.”&nbsp; Intel came to see me &#8212; the CEO.&nbsp; He said he wants to invest $20 billion to build factories in eastern Ohio &#8212; manufacture computer chips, semiconductors that will power the world and everyday lives, smartphones, intel, technology that doesn&#8217;t exist today.<br><br>And they&#8217;re prepared to increase their investment from $20 billion now to $100 billion now, as soon as you get final passage of the innovation bill headed to conference now.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This bill will invest another $200 billion to make us competitive, including $52 billion in computer chips.&nbsp; We invented these damn things.&nbsp; We, the United States &#8212; everybody forgets &#8212; we invented the computer chip, in going to the moon.&nbsp; And we have made &#8212; every single, solitary part of modernizing the technology in a computer chip has been American made.<br><br>But we stopped making them in America, and now we&#8217;re going to make them again.&nbsp; That&#8217;s going to help bring down the price of automobiles, appliances, and so much more.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>And it&#8217;s not just Intel.&nbsp; Take a look at what Ford and General Motors did.&nbsp; Ford committed $11 billion to build electric vehicles in America &#8212; its biggest investment ever.&nbsp; General Motors committed $7 billion to build electric vo- &#8212; vehicles.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Remember when General Motors &#8212; Mary Barra &#8212; was suing California &#8212; suing California because there&#8217;s a higher standard &#8212; mileage standard?&nbsp; I talked to her.&nbsp; And I&#8217;m not saying she changed because of me.&nbsp; I talked to her.&nbsp; She came to &#8212; called me and said she’s no &#8212; she’s going to drop her suit and that she&#8217;s going to commit that 50 percent of all General Motors vehicles by the year 2030 are going to be electric vehicles.&nbsp; And everybody started following suit.<br><br>Just a few years ago, companies might have built these factories elsewhere, but now they&#8217;re building them in America.&nbsp; We’re coming back.&nbsp; We’re coming back stronger than ever before.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, by the way, one of the things I&#8217;ve done &#8212; you know, I didn&#8217;t know &#8212; maybe you all knew it; I didn&#8217;t know when I was in the Senate; I should have &#8212; that there&#8217;s law in the books.&nbsp; It&#8217;s called “Build America.”&nbsp; You&#8217;re allowed to insist I get to spend, as your President &#8212; allocate spending of $600 billion &#8212; everything from the decks of aircraft carriers to a whole range of fleet of automobile, all the things we spend money on in the government.<br><br>Well, the law says that the President of the United States can say all those products have to be made in America.<br><br>Well, what happened?&nbsp; Initially, we just got really lax &#8212; Democrats and Republicans, I might add &#8212; and said, “Here&#8217;s the deal: If it has 55 percent American-made product and 45 is from foreign sources, that&#8217;s okay.”&nbsp; Not in my book.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>So I just signed an executive order saying it&#8217;s got to be a minimum of 75 percent to start; it&#8217;s going to go up.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; And I think it’s the third executive order I signed that no &#8212; no department can give a waiver for a non-American-made product in any American product we&#8217;re buying without my permission, without coming to the White House to determine whether or not that&#8217;s justified.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>And know what&#8217;s happening now?&nbsp; A lot of minority businesses, small businesses getting in on the deal.&nbsp; It gets posted &#8212; there’s an office in the White House &#8212; that says, “This is a product being built.&nbsp; We can’t find &#8212; we can’t find contractors for this. &nbsp;We’re an American product.&nbsp; Here’s what we need.”&nbsp; And guess what?&nbsp; It’s increasing the number of small businesses.</p>



<p>We also know there’s no one &#8212; no one way to increase the standard of living.&nbsp; Putin’s gas tax has pushed prices up higher; it’ll take American manufacturing to bring prices of cars down.&nbsp; But in the meantime, we can save people money in a big way by reducing the cost of childcare, of insulin, of caring for mom and dad and their energy bills.&nbsp; Because that’s another way to fundamentally impact on inflation for a family.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>And it gets down to what&#8217;s the total amount of money you have to spend to meet your basic needs.&nbsp; So guess what?&nbsp; If you &#8212; instead of the 200,000 folks with kids with Type 1 diabetes, if instead of spending an average of six- &#8212; $647 a month for that insulin, as high as $1,000, you&#8217;re only paying $35, and you&#8217;ve saved a hell of a lot of money.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>Think about &#8212; think about your parents, particularly single parents, particularly women out there &#8212; the cost of childcare.&nbsp; Look, when I got here, as Nancy and some of you know, I had lost my family with an automobile accident.&nbsp; I got a call saying my wife was dead and my daughter was dead and my two boys were very badly injured.&nbsp; And I hadn&#8217;t been sworn in yet.</p>



<p>And make a long &#8212; an awful lot of help from a lot of senators saying, “Come and stay just six months.&nbsp; Help us organize.”&nbsp; Boy, was I stupid.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Six months.&nbsp; But they saved my sanity.</p>



<p>And so I came.&nbsp; And everybody says, “God, that &#8212; ain’t that Joe Biden a wonderful guy?&nbsp; He commuted every single day, roughly 300 miles a day, four hours a day, just to be home with his kids.”</p>



<p>It&#8217;s true, I did.&nbsp; I tried to hit over 2 million-some miles on Amtrak.&nbsp; But here&#8217;s the deal: I did it because I could not afford childcare.&nbsp; I couldn&#8217;t even begin to think of it.&nbsp; And I was making &#8212; I was making, at that time, as a United States senator &#8212; I was making more money than I made before.&nbsp; I couldn&#8217;t afford it.<br><br>So I think it&#8217;s &#8212; anybody making 100,000 bucks a year &#8212; single person &#8212; or $120,000 as a family should have childcare capped at 7 percent of their income.&nbsp; Period.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Period.<br>We can do that.&nbsp; That’ll cut the cost of childcare in half.&nbsp; And a family is paying 14 grand a year in San Francisco, Philadelphia &#8212; all the big cities of the country &#8212; for just one child.&nbsp; And look, that extra 7,000 bucks in their pocket will make a difference in what they can do.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s so much we can do.&nbsp; Let me be clear: None of this is going to increase inflation.</p>



<p>Seventeen Nobel laureates spontaneously, a month and a half ago, wrote to me &#8212; seventeen Nobel laureates in the economic &#8211;in economics wrote me a long paper saying this will have &#8212; this will help ease inflationary pressures over time &#8212; not increase it.&nbsp; Ease.&nbsp; And we can do this without raising one single penny on taxes on anybody making less than 400 grand a year.</p>



<p>Let me say that again, be crystal clear: No one making less than $400,000 a year will pay a single additional penny in tax for all these things that were in the &#8212; in the Build Back Better plan.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have to do this.&nbsp; We have to do this.&nbsp; We have to ask &#8212; easy: Ask the biggest &#8212; those of the biggest corporations who pay very little to raise their hand.&nbsp; Everybody in here, raise your hand if you think the existing tax structure is remotely fair.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not being so- &#8212; I could do this at a Republican meeting, privately &#8212; (laughter) &#8212; and they&#8217;d say that &#8212; no one would raise their hand.</p>



<p>But look, we have &#8212; in 2020, 55 of the biggest corporations in America &#8212; the Fortune 500 &#8212; paid zero in taxes and they made $40 billion in profit.&nbsp; Forty billion.</p>



<p>You know it, I know it, the American people know it: It just isn&#8217;t right.</p>



<p>Look, I&#8217;m a capitalist.&nbsp; This isn&#8217;t about punishing anybody.&nbsp; I love Bernie, and I really do.&nbsp; He&#8217;s a great friend.&nbsp; But I &#8212; I&#8217;m not Bernie.</p>



<p>If you can make a billion dollars, make a b- &#8212; for God&#8217;s sake, pay your fair share for &#8212; damn it.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Right now.</p>



<p>But why are teachers and firefighters paying a higher percentage of taxes than billionaires and corporations, which is literally true?&nbsp; Literally true.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>And we can fix this.&nbsp; We can raise the standard of living for hardworking people without raising taxes, without raising inflation, and without raising the deficit.&nbsp;<br>And for all those folks out there that like to tack us for, you know &#8212; let me remind them: Last year, because of what you all did, we reduced the deficit by $360 billion &#8212; (applause) &#8212; we, the Democrats &#8212; while the economy grew.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>We&#8217;re on track right now &#8212; I’m on track to be the first President in history to lower the deficit by over $1 trillion in one year.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br><br>So, I’m sick of this stuff.&nbsp; We have to talk about it because the American people think the reason for inflation is the government is spending more money.&nbsp; Simply not true.&nbsp;<br><br>I don&#8217;t think we need any lectures from our friends on the other side about fiscal responsibility, for God’s sake.&nbsp; Look, we have an ambitious agenda.&nbsp; So let&#8217;s go get it done.&nbsp; That includes standing up for and not giving an inch on core Democratic values.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>We&#8217;re going to continue to stand up to meet the great challenges of our time: voting rights, climate change, gun violence, criminal justice, immigration, and so much more.&nbsp;<br><br>Coming out of the State of the Union &#8212; why I think we&#8217;re in a strong position &#8212; we have a record to be proud of, an agenda that will lower costs for American families and lift this nation up, and a message that resonates.&nbsp; We&#8217;re building a better America, a fairer America, a more decent America.&nbsp; A country that&#8217;s been through a lot these past few years.&nbsp;<br><br>And I mean what I said &#8212; I meant what I said at the State of the Union: We&#8217;re stronger today than we were a year ago.&nbsp; And we will be stronger next year than we are today.&nbsp;<br><br>I&#8217;ve long said &#8212; and I mean this sincerely.&nbsp; I’m not &#8212; I’ve spent a lot of time with Xi Jinping.&nbsp; Over 36 hours of private meetings with him.&nbsp; He asked me &#8212; we were in the Tibetan Plateau and he asked me if I could define America for him.&nbsp; Just me and a simultaneous interpreter, him and an interpreter.&nbsp; And, by the way, I turned all my notes over.&nbsp; Okay?&nbsp; (Laughter and applause.)<br><br>But seriously, he said, “Can you define America for me?”&nbsp; He&#8217;s a tough guy.&nbsp; And I said, “I can.”&nbsp; And I said, “In one word.”&nbsp; And he looked at me.&nbsp; I said, “Possibilities.”&nbsp;<br><br>We’re the only nation in the world &#8212; it’s the reason why we’re looked at as sometimes being arrogant.&nbsp; We think anything is possible.&nbsp; Anything is possible if we act together.&nbsp;<br><br>Look, we&#8217;ve taken every crisis we ever faced and turned it into an opportunity.&nbsp; Think of one that hadn&#8217;t that way.&nbsp; Whatever the crisis was, we&#8217;ve come out of it better than we were in before it occurred, every single time.&nbsp; But we’ve got to stick together.&nbsp; We got to stick together.&nbsp; We can do this again.&nbsp; We can do it.&nbsp;<br><br>Look, I &#8212; I&#8217;m going to get going.&nbsp; I shouldn’t &#8212; I&#8217;ll stop here.&nbsp; I know you all have questions, and I’m supposed &#8212; anyway, thank you, thank you, thank you.&nbsp; And I&#8217;ll be back here for questions.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>1:18 P.M. EST</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Aboard Air Force One<br>En Route Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</p>



<p>11:37 A.M. EST</p>



<p>MR. BATES:&nbsp; I have a little bit for you at the top.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, today, after giving the keynote address at the House Democratic Issues Conference, President Biden will visit a Philadelphia-area, majority-Hispanic elementary school to highlight how the American Rescue Plan is delivering critical resources to keep schools safe and open, combat learning loss, and address student mental health.</p>



<p>When the President entered office, only 46 percent of schools were open; today, over 99 percent are.&nbsp; That was not by accident; it was the product of his historic investments not just to get schools open, but ensure they have the resources to address the long-term impact COVID has had on schools and students.</p>



<p>Today’s visit will highlight how American Rescue Plan dollars are enabling this school to help students catch up, including hiring more school staff, providing tutoring, and providing afterschool programs that are supporting student mental health.&nbsp; And that is reflective of what has been achieved across the country on account of the American Rescue Plan, which, again, every single Republican in Congress voted against.</p>



<p>President Biden will also speak with students directly to hear candidly about the issues they are facing today.</p>



<p>And then, Judge Jackson just wrapped her second successful week of meetings with senators in both parties, all of whom have been gracious hosts and who have asked engaging questions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As you know, the President chose her because she&#8217;s an extraordinarily qualified jurist with experience at all levels of our justice system; who’s devoted to the Constitution and the rule of law; and who assesses cases fairly, neutrally, based solely on the facts; and who has been confirmed three times on a bipartisan basis by the Senate already.</p>



<p>In fact, Senator McConnell said last week that there is, quote, “no question” she&#8217;s qualified to serve on the Supreme Court.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yesterday, Senator Cornyn highlighted her practical experience as a judge, a criterion he said is important.</p>



<p>And I want to just take a minute to appreciate the broad set of endorsements that have come in for her, including from law enforcement.&nbsp; Out of the gate, Fraternal Order of Police issued a statement saying, “From our analysis of Judge Jackson’s record and some of her cases, we believe she has considered the facts and applied the law consistently and fairly on a range of issues.&nbsp; There is little doubt that she has the temperament, intellect, legal experience, and family background to have earned this appointment.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>That was followed shortly after by the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This week, a large group of law enforcement officials from across the country, including a number of police chiefs, wrote to the Senate urging that she have &#8212; that she be confirmed in a timely manner.&nbsp; We saw a group of former U.S. attorneys do the same.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yesterday, a group of 83 former state attorneys general from both parties wrote to the Senate urging her confirmation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Retired D.C. Circuit Judge Thomas Griffith has urged her confirmation, as has retired Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals Judge J. Michael Luttig, both of whom are highly respected conservatives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Conservative attorney William Burck, who represented Trump White House Counsel Don McGahn and a number of other senior Trump officials in court, has said that she is as qualified as anyone can be. &nbsp;</p>



<p>And I just wanted to take a minute to take stock of that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And then a quick preview of next week for you: The President will sign the bipartisan funding bill, which takes some time for Congress to process, get to his desk.&nbsp; In the meantime, he will sign the short-term continuing resolution to keep the government open until the bipartisan funding bill is signed.</p>



<p>On Monday, the President will address the National League of Cities Congressional City Conference.</p>



<p>On Tuesday, Equal Pay Day, the President, Vice President, First Lady, and Second Gentleman will participate in an event in the East Room to celebrate Women&#8217;s History Month.</p>



<p>And on Thursday, I think it is a decent bet that we will commemorate St. Patrick&#8217;s Day.</p>



<p>And with that, I’m happy to take you all’s questions.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two questions for you, Andrew.&nbsp; Thanks for doing this.&nbsp; First, President Biden, just a few hours ago, said that Russia would face a severe price should they use chemical weapons against Ukraine.&nbsp; What exactly did he mean, especially when, after these waves of &#8212; waves of sanctions already implemented, it does not appear yet that President Putin has buckled under the pressure?</p>



<p>And then second, just yesterday, U.S. Ambassador to the U.N., Linda Thomas-Greenfield, she said that what Putin has done to Ukraine constitutes a war crime.&nbsp; But already twice, when asked, Vice President Harris hasn’t matched that language.&nbsp; So what does the White House believe?&nbsp; Does it believe that Russia&#8217;s actions against Ukraine constitute war crimes?</p>



<p>MR. BATES:&nbsp; Well, like you just mentioned, you heard from the President clearly that if Russia uses chemical weapons, there will be severe consequences.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have anything to preview on that front, but he&#8217;s his meaning was unmistakable.</p>



<p>And when it comes to chemical weapons specifically, as you know, one of the false flags or pretexts that Russia has been indicating they might attempt to employ here is chemical weapons.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve warned about that for some time.&nbsp; We decided to participate in the recent Security Council session about this, not just to forcefully debunk Russian gaslighting on this subject, but to further call Putin out, as we have during this entire episode successfully at each juncture, where we have reason to believe they are trying to fabricate another false justification for more violence.</p>



<p>The truth is: Russia is the only country in this equation with a chemical and biological weapons program in violation of international law.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re not going to be specific about intelligence, which the President also mentioned this morning.&nbsp; But look no further than Russia&#8217;s track record.&nbsp; They have used chemical weapons &#8212; which, again, they are the only country in the mix here who possesses those &#8212; in Syria.&nbsp; And time again, we have warned about this particular pretext.&nbsp; And so it is something that we are being attentive to.</p>



<p>When it comes to war crimes, we have all seen the devastating images coming out of Ukraine and are appalled<a> </a>by Russia&#8217;s brutal tactics.&nbsp; Pregnant women on stretchers, apartment buildings shelled, families killed while seeking safety from this terrible violence.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are also seeing reports of other types of potential abuses, including sexual and gender-based violence.&nbsp; These are disgusting attacks.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Civilian casualties are increasing.&nbsp; If Russia is intentionally targeting civilians, that would be a war crime.&nbsp; And as we are all seeing on live television, evidence is mounting.&nbsp; And we are documenting it as it takes place.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are strong indications that this is occurring and that the heinous way Russia is prosecuting this war will result in war crimes.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are supporting the important work of human rights activists, civil society, and independent media in Ukraine who are documenting, collecting, and exposing evidence of possible war crimes, human rights abuses, and violations of international humanitarian law.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will share the evidence we gather with allies and partners and with those investigations &#8212; investigators to support accountability using every tool available, including criminal prosecutions when appropriate.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the trade announcement today &#8212; are you seeking higher tariffs on all Russian imports to the U.S. or only certain ones?&nbsp; And are those tariff levels going to be coordinated with European allies?</p>



<p>MR. BATES:&nbsp; So, what I&#8217;ve got there is, like you mentioned, we&#8217;re revoking Russia&#8217;s most-favored-nation status, which is going to mean that Russian imports to the United States face tariffs and other &#8212; and other barriers.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And &#8212; you know what?&nbsp; Why don&#8217;t we take a seat and continue?<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Too late.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. BATES:&nbsp; Well, all right.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Never mind, I just didn&#8217;t want anybody to get &#8212; get hurt there.&nbsp; Just one second.</p>



<p>(Gaggle interrupted as Air Force One lands.)</p>



<p>But we are going to include seafood, spirits, vodka, non-industrial diamonds, in terms of the Russian imports that are banned.&nbsp; And we are also going to be restricting U.S. exports to Russia so that they are not receiving luxury items like high-end watches, luxury vehicles, high-end apparel, high-end alcohol, jewelry, other goods frequently purchased by Russian elites.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I want to underscore that the countries with whom we&#8217;re working in unison on this represent 50 percent of the global economy.&nbsp; It is going to take a significant toll on Russia, in addition to the steps we have already taken, which have resulted in the ruble being worth less than a penny, has resulted in their stock market being closed for an historic period of time.&nbsp;&nbsp; It has resulted in their credit rating being labeled “junk” by authorities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>(Gaggle interrupted as Air Force One crew deplanes.)</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Andrew, is the U.S. in touch with India and Pakistan about India having accidentally launched a missile into Pakistan?&nbsp; And are &#8212;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. BATES:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have updates for you on that.&nbsp; I can see if our national security team does a little bit later.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And do you have any updates on the status of the Iran talks?&nbsp; Russia is demanding that the agreement inclu- &#8212; preclude sanctions on &#8212; related to Ukraine, impacting their ability to trade with Iran.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. BATES:&nbsp; So, Russia has taken some public positions attempting to tie the JCPOA to unrelated issues like Ukraine, so we&#8217;re working through that with European allies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the bottom line is: It is in our national security interest and the national security interest of everyone involved, including Russia, to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the endgame of the sanctions exactly, knowing that more have been imposed today?&nbsp; What does the U.S. believe needs to be done in order to resolve this war in Ukraine?</p>



<p>MR. BATES:&nbsp; Well, we have provided Putin with possible off-ramps from the beginning, and we will continue to do so.&nbsp; But he is the only one who can decide whether to take them.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So far, every time he has had an opportunity to take an off-ramp, he&#8217;s instead gone full speed ahead.&nbsp; And the longer he forces his abused troops to attack Ukraine, the more he broadcasts his own profound weakness as a leader.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Putin&#8217;s only strategy has been escalation at every turn, but it&#8217;s becoming increasingly clear that it&#8217;s escalation without an endgame.&nbsp; And his erratic brutality, which comes at the expense of the Russian people and, again, his own demoralized troops, is proving to be a disaster for his country.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He has a clear plan to be savage toward Ukraine, but to what end?&nbsp; His initial military plan to quickly capture Ukraine and force a capitulation has failed.&nbsp; Now he&#8217;s turning to a strategy of laying waste to population centers to try and break the will of the Ukrainian people.&nbsp; But that strategy will make effective long-term Russian control of Ukraine impossible.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meanwhile, the world is rallying around the Ukrainians.&nbsp; And we are exacting an enormous and historic toll on Russians’ &#8212; Russia&#8217;s economy because of his war of choice.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What future off-ramps do you have in mind?<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. BATES:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have anything more to preview.&nbsp; But as today&#8217;s actions make clear, the more that this continues, not only is he losing people on the ground to whom he has lied about the cause for going into Ukraine unprovoked, but the Russian economy is in tatters.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They have lost 30 years of economic progress when it comes to integrating their economy with the world in a matter of weeks.&nbsp; That is not going to stop until he stops.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then the last thing is: Yesterday, we heard President Biden accuse Republicans of playing games with oil prices amid a couple other accusations.&nbsp; Does this amount to a preview of the midterm messaging?&nbsp; And how are you guys going to weather both inflation and rising oil prices?</p>



<p>MR. BATES:  So I can&#8217;t speak to midterm messaging directly from here.  But, factually, I think it&#8217;s important to keep in mind, first of all, every action that we have taken to punish Russia for Putin&#8217;s unprovoked further invasion of Ukraine has had strong bipartisan support and buy-in.  And, of course, Russia&#8217;s destabilizing actions have played an important role in recent increases in gas prices. <br><br>     But I&#8217;m glad you raised this, because the New York Times had a very conclusive fact check yesterday.  The headline was: “Republicans Wrongly Blame Biden for Rising Gas Prices.”  And so I think it&#8217;s important to note that independent arbiters in the press have consulted experts and they have deemed that these attacks are disingenuous and that the rising gas prices you&#8217;ve seen all over the world, but beforehand, are due to the pandemic and pressures that has put on international supply. <br><br>     So, thank you all.  Sorry, we didn&#8217;t have more time. <br><br>  11:51 A.M. EST</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Cotroceni Palace<br>Bucharest, Romania</em></p>



<p>4:14 P.M. EET<br><br>PRESIDENT IOHANNIS:&nbsp; (As interpreted.)&nbsp; Good afternoon.&nbsp; I’m pleased to welcome to Bucharest Vice President of the United States of America, Her Excellency, Madam Kamala Harris.&nbsp;<br><br>Dear Madam Vice President, welcome to Romania.<br><br>I would like to thank Madam Vice President for her presence in Romania in this challenging moment for the democratic community and for the Euro-Atlantic security.<br><br>Your visit, Madam Vice President, reflects once more the strength and solidity of the bilateral strategic partnership and the firm commitment of the United States for the security of Romania and NATO Allies from the eastern flank.<br><br>I have conveyed to Madam Vice President the appreciation of Romania for the efforts and leadership of the United States, of President Biden, of Madam Vice President, and of the entire Washington administration in this very complicated context.<br><br>The continuous dialogue and the close coordination of the United States with Romania and with all the Allies and partners had an essential contribution to delivering a unified and strong message of the international community to the actions of Russia.<br><br>Together, we have come up with a firm and prompt response, both from the point of view of assistance in multiple areas, both for Ukraine and for the individuals affected by the conflict, both when it comes to the sanctions applied to Russia and to the measures for adopting the Allied posture in its entirety, especially on the eastern flank.<br><br>Madam Vice President has reconfirmed as part of our &#8212; today’s discussions the full commitment of the United States of America for the Article 5 regarding the collective defense of the NATO Washington Treaty.&nbsp; This Article contains the essence and spirit of NATO and guarantees that any attempt to impact the security of one NATO state will receive a firm, prompt response of the entire Alliance.<br><br>I’m saying it with a great responsibility: NATO will act without hesitation to defend each and every Allied state, including obviously Romania.&nbsp; It is a scenario that all of us want to avoid.&nbsp; But we, as Allies &#8212; and I’m saying it while I stand next to our most important strategic partner &#8212; will defend every inch when it comes to respecting the commitments that bind us.<br><br>I have conveyed my gratitude for these unshakeable security guarantees as the Romanian society has never had in its history, and thanks to which every citizen of Romania can be confident about his own safety and the safety of his family.</p>



<p>I have also conveyed my gratitude for the consolidation of the United States military presence in Romania.&nbsp; We have also discussed about the need within this tense context to keep increasing the American and Allied presence in Romania in the long run as an additional measure to ensure the security of our country and of the entire region.</p>



<p>I have conveyed that, in turn, Romania understands that the security starts at home.&nbsp; And from this point of view, I have recently decided to increase the defense expenses from 2 percent, where it stands now, to 2.5 percent of GDP.&nbsp; And this is greatly appreciated by the American side.</p>



<p>Together with Madam Vice President, we have assessed the long-term implications of the aggression that is taking place in Ukraine, as well as the Russian military presence in Belarus and the Euro-Atlantic.</p>



<p>We have agreed to cooperate to further consolidate the defense measures and deterrence on the eastern flank with a focus on the southern part.</p>



<p>I have highlighted the fact that, in this context, it is necessary to operationalize as soon as possible the NATO battle group on the territory of Romania.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Overall, Romania’s strategic assessment is that it becomes necessary to fundamentally rethink the concept, the structure, and the constituent elements of the NATO posture on the eastern flank, taking into account the fact that the current circumstances are considerably different compared to the moment when the current approach concerning the eastern flank was projected.</p>



<p>We need a united forward presence and a coherent one as soon as possible.&nbsp; We have discussed today about our common approach in order to come up with a common response to these unprecedented challenges, especially when it comes to the humanitarian area.</p>



<p>Romania, the United States, along with its Allied and partner countries, have offered assistance in different domains to Ukraine and its people that fights with heroism, courage, and determination.</p>



<p>As you know, I have decided the operationalization in Suceava of a humanitarian logistics facility &#8212; so-called hub &#8212; that, thanks to the support of the European Union, has the role to collect and transport the international donations in the area of humanitarian assistance for Ukrainian citizens.&nbsp; I have invited the United States to support the activity of this hub.</p>



<p>We have also discussed about the support that is so necessary to the Republic of Moldova.&nbsp; The situation of the neighboring country is unique from the point of view of a very high ratio between the number of refugees and population.&nbsp; This pressure overlaps with the economic and energy-related difficulties that the Republic of Moldova has to face.</p>



<p>Together with Madam Vice President, we have analyzed the energy security prospects.&nbsp; We agreed that this crisis can represent a historic opportunity to switch &#8212; to reach a true European energy independence from the Russian gas through investments in renewable sources in the civilian nuclear sector; through diversifying sources, imports of liquefied natural gas; and, obviously, through increased interconnectivity.<br><br>As you probably remember, within the context of COP26 Glasgow Summit, the common Romania-USA project to include small modular reactors in the Romanian national system &#8212; we agreed to continue and to intensify our cooperation in this strategic domain.</p>



<p>Last but not least, a fundamental aspect for the success of our efforts and to ensure &#8212; ensuring our common security is represented by the maintenance and consolidation of the transatlantic relationship by ensuring the unity and coordination of the European Union, United States, NATO, and G7.</p>



<p>Romania brought its own contribution in this regard by promoting the Bucharest Nine format, which was very efficient, even in this context.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This year, we celebrate 25 years from the launch of our strategic partnership that continuously developed during the last years and is currently at its highest level in its history.</p>



<p>In addition to the consolidated cooperation in the area of defense and security, and of the ambitious initiatives in the energy sector, I have discussed with Madam Vice President to continue expanding all the dimensions of the strategic partnership, from the economic one, including through the development of regional priorities, strategic projects related to the interconnectivity and that are of interest for Romania, and up to the consolidation of scientific cooperation and of, obviously, interhuman relationships.</p>



<p>We also discussed about visa waiver topic in regards to Romania, and we hope to have some results in this area as well.</p>



<p>Once again, I would like to thank Vice President Harris for coming to Romania.&nbsp; I&#8217;m sure that the substantive discussions that we had will be followed up by concrete measures and adequate &#8212; appropriate decisions for the unprecedented context in which we currently find ourselves in.<br><br>Thank you, Madam Vice President.&nbsp; You have the floor.<br><br>&nbsp;VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:&nbsp; Thank you, President Iohannis, for the warm welcome to Romania and for your steadfast friendship to the partnership that we have that is longstanding and enduring.&nbsp;<br><br>I also want to recognize and thank Prime Minister Ciucă for the conversation that we had last week.<br><br>If I may, Mr. President, I&#8217;d like to speak directly to the Romanian people for one moment, to thank you, on behalf of the United States.<br><br>Under the leadership of President Iohannis, Romania has been extraordinary in the generosity and the courage that you have shown in this moment.&nbsp; Around the world, we have watched as you have received refugees.&nbsp; Around the world, and I will speak for the United States, we know of the particular challenges that you face geographically, yet you have shown so much courage.<br><br>The meeting that the President and I had today was a very productive meeting to reaffirm the strength of the relationship and friendship between the United States and Romania.&nbsp;<br><br>I&#8217;ve said many times, including this afternoon with the President and the President&#8217;s leadership, but around the world, and I will say it here: America&#8217;s commitment to Article 5 is ironclad.&nbsp; We take very seriously our role and the relationships that we have within the NATO Alliance.&nbsp;<br><br>We take seriously and are prepared to act on the words we speak when we say an attack against one is an attack against all.&nbsp; We are firm in our commitment &#8212; when I say and we say over and over again, President Joe Biden says: We will defend every inch of NATO territory.<br><br>So I am present in Romania today to reaffirm that commitment, in addition to thanking the president, your leadership, and the people of Romania.&nbsp;<br><br>The strength of our Alliance has endured and is now bigger and stronger than ever.&nbsp; The strength of our Alliance includes our mutual commitment to stand on the principles that we hold dear and share, that include the defense of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of independent states &#8212; and in this case, Ukraine.<br><br>We are clear that the work that is to be done in response to Putin&#8217;s war includes standing strong within the Alliance to support the needs of our partners.&nbsp; To that end, and to demonstrate our commitment as the United States, in recent weeks we sent a 1,000-member Stryker squadron.&nbsp; That creates a total force of 2,000 American troops who are prepared to stand in defense of our commitment to the NATO Alliance and the eastern flank.<br><br>We have reinforced our recent commitments, all with the mention and with the meaning of strengthening our deterrence and our collective defense.<br><br>I want to thank you, President Iohannis, for your leadership on NATO&#8217;s eastern flank.&nbsp; I want to thank you for in addition to doing all that you have been doing in your role of leadership, to modernizing and to increasing the resources that are available.<br><br>You and I talked about the importance of running a government in a way that we modernize and are efficient and effective with the resources we have.&nbsp; You have been a model in that regard, and I thank you.<br><br>In terms of our mutual support for the people of Ukraine &#8212; in Washington, in the United States Congress, we have taken recent action, including a commitment of $13.6 billion<br>for Ukraine and the region in terms of security assistance and humanitarian assistance.&nbsp;<br><br>The President &#8212; Iohannis and I talked extensively, and I was very moved, Mr. President, by the stories you shared with me of the time you spent with refugees, and the heart-wrenching experience that they are having.<br><br>So we stand together, Romania and the United States, in ensuring that we will do all that is required to put resources into the humanitarian piece of this, understanding that the needs are significant and immediate.<br><br>To the extent that we are offering humanitarian assistance, in addition to the $13.6 billion package from the United States Congress, $4 billion of that will be directly committed to humanitarian assistance.&nbsp; That is on top of the $53 million that I announced yesterday that, through the U.N., the United States will give to the World Food Programme.<br><br>But I must say, when we are talking about humanitarian assistance, Romania has been a hub of humanitarian assistance.&nbsp; And that is yet another reason that we are here to thank the President and the people of this great country for what you are doing based on the needs of this region.&nbsp; You have been welcoming tens of thousands of refugees, and doing it with such compassion and such grace.<br><br>So I&#8217;ll conclude my remarks by saying that this is a strong and enduring relationship. &nbsp;It is an important relationship.&nbsp; And the importance of this relationship is being highlighted at this very moment.&nbsp; But it is a relationship that will continue over the years.<br><br>And again, I thank you, Mr. President, and the people of this beautiful country for all you do and all you represent.&nbsp; Thank you.<br><br>PRESIDENT IOHANNIS:&nbsp; Thank you so much, Madam Vice President.&nbsp; We have a couple of questions.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (As interpreted.)&nbsp; Good afternoon.&nbsp; Roxana Zamfirescu, State TV.&nbsp; I have a question for both officials.&nbsp; I would like to ask you if the United States plans to increase the number of troops and to create here a permanent presence.&nbsp; I&#8217;m asking this in the context of which 150 kilometers away from the Romanian frontieră take &#8212; bombardments take place.&nbsp; And I would like to ask you as well if &#8212; what are the chances of the war extending towards Romania and Republic of Moldova?<br><br>VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:&nbsp; I cannot repeat frequently enough that the United States is committed to our friendship and alliance with Romania.&nbsp; And to that end, we have a continuous and rotating commitment of U.S. troops to this country, most recently with the deployment of the 1,000-member Stryker squadron.<br><br>And as the people of Romania know, we also know that this is a dynamic situation, and we will, on a daily basis, assess the needs that we have to maintain stability in this region.<br><br>As it relates to what might be the future conduct of Putin, I cannot speculate.&nbsp; But we are clear in our position, which is that as a member of NATO, an attack against one is an attack against all.<br><br>PRESIDENT IOHANNIS:&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; (As interpreted.)&nbsp; I believe that the first part received a very clear response from Madam Vice President.&nbsp;<br><br>As for the second part, I can highlight the fact that we do not have information that would indicate that Romania would represent a target of an aggression.&nbsp; On the other hand, it is very clear that this Russian action, this war started against Ukraine, definitely created, definitely produced a result &#8212; a visible, a firm, a clear result.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s represented by the unity of NATO and the determination of NATO Allies to stand together and to defend itself &#8212; each other.<br><br>VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:&nbsp; Nancy &#8212;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, thank you.&nbsp;<br><br>VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:&nbsp; &#8212; from Bloomberg.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Madam Vice President, the humanitarian crisis is growing and the violence only seems to be getting worse.&nbsp; The White House and British government have both offered dire warnings about the possibility of the chemical weapons being deployed by Russia, and diplomatic efforts seem to have failed.&nbsp; Is there any discernible pathway out of the crisis?&nbsp; And what is the off-ramp?<br><br>And to the President of Romania: I&#8217;m curious if you think that there are any specific economic sanctions that you&#8217;d like to see the U.S. pursue that they have not done so already.&nbsp; Thank you.<br><br>VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:&nbsp; In terms of your question about off-ramp: You know, from the beginning, the United States has been attempting sincerely to engage in diplomacy &#8212; actively.&nbsp; And from everything that we know and have witnessed, Putin shows no sign of engaging in serious diplomacy.<br><br>As many of you know, I gave a speech in Munich three weeks ago, before the in- &#8212; the reinvasion of Ukraine started.&nbsp; And I said then what we have maintained all along: We&#8217;re witnessing a playbook &#8212; the Russian playbook &#8212; and it includes lies, misinformation, and the acts of aggression that we are now witnessing.<br><br>We maintain that diplomacy is the way to resolve these issues that coexists with our commitment to ensure that our Allies are strong and that there must be serious consequence and accountability for what Russia is doing, which is why we have &#8212; to the other point of your question &#8212; engaged in historic sanctions and to the effect of basically a freefall of the ruble.&nbsp; The Russian stock market is still not open.&nbsp; Their credit rating is now “junk.”&nbsp;<br><br>And there will be more announcements about more action that we will take to ensure serious consequence for what is atrocious and outrageous conduct on behalf of the Russian people by Putin.<br><br>PRESIDENT IOHANNIS:&nbsp; The sanction packages have been discussed between the United States and the European Union.&nbsp; We worked very well together on this, and we will continue to work together on this.&nbsp; This is the economic side.<br><br>On the other hand, the two of us just stated that we stand strong together according to Article 5 of the NATO treaty, and we will continue this way.&nbsp; So, if new sanctions will be necessary, they will be discussed and applied.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (As interpreted.)&nbsp; Good afternoon.&nbsp; Oana Bala, Radio Romania.&nbsp; Madam Vice President, Mr. President, we have seen as the Russian troops attacked a maternity as well as humanitarian convoys.&nbsp; A lot of civilians were killed, including &#8212; a lot of people were killed, including children, and this triggered a huge international response.&nbsp; Do you believe that Russia committed war crimes in Ukraine?<br><br>VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:&nbsp; I think I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: We are clear that any intentional attack or targeting of civilians is a war crime.&nbsp; Period.<br><br>PRESIDENT IOHANNIS:&nbsp; (As interpreted.)&nbsp; We have discussed these topics because the images are, of course, shocking.&nbsp; I have discussed about this with Madam Vice President, and yesterday we discussed this topic as part of the European Union summit.&nbsp;<br><br>And it is very clear to everyone that such situations must be documented in such a way that when the right moment comes, the authorities and the competent institutions would be able to follow up on these &#8212; on these facts and to establish in a correct manner on the international level whether or not they constitute war crimes, who committed them, and what should be the appropriate consequences for them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, it is unimaginable for all of us to see such images now in the 21st century, in a war that takes place in Europe.&nbsp; It’s outrageous.<br><br>VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:&nbsp; Aamer Madhani from the Associated Press.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Thank you, Madam Vice President.&nbsp; I really appreciate it.&nbsp;<br><br>But may I ask, Mr. President, your country and many of your neighbors are enduring enormous cost aiding Ukrainian refugees, and you also face a really dire threat in the Black Sea.&nbsp; And I was just wondering if &#8212; what specifically you&#8217;ve asked the Vice President for.&nbsp; Particularly, do you need more U.S. troops here?&nbsp; Do you need any specific more materiel defense aid?&nbsp;</p>



<p>And if I can ask you, Madam Vice President: President Biden has said that Americans will feel some pain for the sake of defending freedom and liberty, but there does seem to be no endgame in sight.&nbsp; How long should Americans expect &#8212; how long should we be bracing for this really, sort of, historic inflation and some unprecedented gas prices?<br><br>VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; In terms of the discussions that the President Iohannis and I had, they ranged in subject, including the issue of the Black Sea, and I&#8217;ll let him explain in more detail as he would like.</p>



<p>But we are, again, fully aware and apprised because we are in constant communication with the President, with his administration here about the concerns that they have about the entire region and, frankly, the vulnerability.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All you have to do is look at the map and see that where Romania exists geographically &#8212; and as is the case for our Allies on the eastern flank &#8212; that there are potential vulnerabilities, which is why we say very clearly: We will dedicate &#8212; and have been especially enhancing, over the last few weeks &#8212; our support based on their current needs.</p>



<p>When we look at Putin&#8217;s actions &#8212; the previous question &#8212; there is &#8212; it is painful to watch.&nbsp; It is painful to watch what is happening to innocent people in Ukraine who just want to live in their own country and have pride in themselves as Ukrainians, who want to be home speaking the language they know, going to the church that they know, raising their children in the community where their families have lived for generations.&nbsp; And by the millions, now, are having to flee with nothing but a backpack.<br><br>And then you compound that with what happened a couple of days &#8212; the President talked about it today; I talked about it yesterday &#8212; in terms of a maternity hospital, pregnant women.&nbsp; We are &#8212; we have the unfortunate experience, all of us right now who are not in Ukraine, of witnessing horror.&nbsp;<br><br>So we are committed in everything we are doing.&nbsp; And, yes, then the President did say in the State of the Union,<br>there is a price to pay for democracy.&nbsp; Got to stand with your friends.&nbsp; And as everybody knows, even in your personal life, being loyal to those friendships based on common principles and values, sometimes it&#8217;s difficult.&nbsp; Often, it ain&#8217;t easy.&nbsp; But that&#8217;s what the friendship is about, based on shared values.&nbsp; So that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re doing.<br><br>PRESIDENT IOHANNIS:&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Russia started its attack on Ukraine from the south, from the Black Sea area.&nbsp; This is<br>a scenario we have been warning about for many years now.&nbsp;<br><br>On the other hand, Romania has approximately 650 kilometers of land border with Ukraine.&nbsp; It&#8217;s the longest land border of all allies neighboring with Ukraine.&nbsp;<br><br>So, yes, we are concerned.&nbsp; We are concerned about the eastern flank.&nbsp; And this is why we are working on making the eastern flank stronger.<br><br>And, yes, we discussed with Vice President Harris about these issues.&nbsp; And I raised the issue of the eastern flank, that the eastern flank has to be strong, it has to be well balanced.&nbsp; Because if one part of the eastern flank is strong and the other part is weak, it&#8217;s obviously a weakness on the eastern flank.<br><br>So the eastern flank has to be strong to defend the entire NATO, to defend the Euro-Atlantic area.&nbsp;<br><br>And on the eastern flank, the Allies &#8212; and, in this case, we discussed specifically about U.S. and Romania &#8212; have to materialize a force that is strong enough to be deterrent.&nbsp; NATO relies on strength and deterrence.&nbsp; So to deter somebody, you have to be strong in that area.<br><br>So, yes, we discussed about the necessity of a NATO battlegroup in Romania.&nbsp; And, obviously, the United States play an important role in this.<br><br>We discussed about enhanced U.S. presence on the eastern flank, specifically, obviously, on our part of the eastern flank.&nbsp; And we discussed, obviously, about Article 5 of NATO and about the longstanding partnership between our troops, because soldiers from the United States have been in Romania for many years now, and they work very well together with the Romanian forces, and they are a real gain on the southern part of the eastern flank.&nbsp; And they are a significant reassurance for Romanians that we do not stand alone, that we stand with the United States and with all the other NATO Allies.<br><br>So, yes, we discussed all this, and we have a common approach, if I may say so.&nbsp; And this is what &#8212; specific for our partnership.&nbsp; We have &#8212; we enjoy a strategic partnership because we try to solve problems and we do solve problems together.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there a specific number for the enhanced presence you would like to see?&nbsp; Is there a number of U.S. or NATO troops, additionally, you would like to see in Romania?<br><br>PRESIDENT IOHANNIS:&nbsp; Well, why don’t we let the military from the States and from Romania talk together, and then to NATO, and then all of this will be public after that.<br><br>VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:&nbsp; Thank you.<br><br>PRESIDENT IOHANNIS:&nbsp; No more questions?&nbsp; (Laughs.)<br><br>Thank you so much.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;END&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4:44 P.M. EET</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Roosevelt Room</p>



<p>10:31 A.M. EST<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Good morning.&nbsp; I’m sorry to keep you waiting.&nbsp; I’ve just spoken for some time with President Zelenskyy of Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I told him, as I have each and every time we’ve spoken, the United States stands with the people of Ukraine and their bravely &#8212; as they bravely fight to defend their country.&nbsp; And they are doing that.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>And as Putin continues his merciless assault, the United States and our Allies and partners continue to work in lockstep to ramp up the economic pressure on Putin and to further isolate Russia on the global stage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Later today, together with other NATO Allies and the G7 &#8212; Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom &#8212; as well as the European Union &#8212; we’re going to jointly announce several new steps to squeeze Putin and hold him more &#8212; even more accountable for his aggression against Ukraine.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I want to speak to a few of those points today.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, each of our nations is going to take steps to deny most-favored-nation status to Russia.&nbsp; A most-favored-nation status designation means two countries have agreed to trade with each other under the best possible terms &#8212;&nbsp;low tariffs, few barriers to trade, and the highest possible imports allowed.</p>



<p>In the United States, we call this “permanent normal trade relations” &#8212; PNTR &#8212; but it’s the same thing.&nbsp; Revoking PNTR for Russia is going to make it harder for Russia to do business with the United States.&nbsp; And doing it in unison with other nations that make up half of the global economy will be another crushing blow to the Russian economy that’s already suffering very badly from our sanctions.</p>



<p>And I want to thank Speaker Pelosi, Leader McCarthy, Leader Schumer and McConnell, and Senators Wyden and Crapo, Representatives Neal and Brady for their bipartisan leadership on this in the Congress.</p>



<p>I would like to offer a special thanks to Speaker Pelosi</p>



<p>who has been a strong advocate for revoking PNTR and who agreed to hold off on that in the House until I could line up all of our key allies to keep us in complete unison.  Unity among our allies is critically important, as you all know, from my perspective, at least.<br><br>     Many issues divide us in Washington, but standing for democracy in Ukraine, <s>pushing</s> [punishing] Russia’s aggression should not be one of those issues.</p>



<p>The free world is coming together to confront Putin.&nbsp; Our two parties here at home are leading the way.&nbsp; And with that bipartisan cooperation, I’m looking forward to signing into law the bill revoking PNTR &#8212; which is, again, most people think of it as “most-favored-nations” status.</p>



<p>We’re also taking a further step of banning imports of goods from several signature sectors of the Russian economy, including seafoods, vodka, and diamonds.</p>



<p>And we’re going to continue to squeeze Putin.&nbsp; The G7 will seek to deny Russia the ability to borrow from leading multinational institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.</p>



<p>Putin is an aggressor &#8212; is the aggressor.&nbsp; And Putin must pay the price.</p>



<p>He cannot pursue a war that threatens the very foundations &#8212; which he’s doing &#8212; the very foundations of international peace and stability and then ask for financial help from the international community.</p>



<p>The G7 is also stepping up pressure on corrupt Russian billionaires.&nbsp; We’re adding new names to the list of oligarchs and their families that we’re targeting.&nbsp; And we’re increasing coordination among the G7 countries to target and capture their ill-begotten gains.</p>



<p>They support Putin.&nbsp; They steal from the Russian people.&nbsp; And they seek to hide their money in our countries.&nbsp; They’re part of a &#8212; that kleptocracy that exists in Moscow.&nbsp; And they must share in the pain of these sanctions.</p>



<p>And while we’re going after these &#8212; their superyachts and their vacation homes worth hundreds of milli- &#8212; millions of dollars, we’re also going to make it harder for them to buy high-end products&nbsp;manufactured in our country.&nbsp; We’re banning the export of luxu- &#8212; luxury goods to Russia.&nbsp; They’re also the latest steps we’re taking, but they’re not the last steps we’re going to take.</p>



<p>And as I said at the beginning of all of these steps, we’re going to hit Putin harder because the United States and our closest Allies and partners are acting in unison.</p>



<p>The totality of our sanctions and export controls is crushing the Russian economy.</p>



<p>The ruble has lost more than half its value.&nbsp; They tell me it takes about 200 rubles to equal 1 dollar these days.&nbsp; The Moscow stock exchange has been closed for fully &#8212; for two weeks because they know the moment it opens, it will probably collapse.</p>



<p>Credit rating agencies has downgraded Russia’s government to “junk” status &#8212; its economy to “junk” status.</p>



<p>The list of businesses and international corporations leaving Russia is growing by the day.</p>



<p>We’re also continuing the close <s>corporations</s> [cooperation] with Allies and partners to make sure that the close cooperation we continue to have, the Ukrainian people are &#8212; are able to defend their own nation.</p>



<p>The United States has sent more than $1 billion in security assistance to Ukraine over the last year, including anti-armor and anti-air capabilities &#8212; taking out tanks and planes and helicopters &#8212; with new shipments arriving every day.</p>



<p>We, the United States, are also facilitating significant shipments of security assistance from our Allies and partners to Ukraine.</p>



<p>On the humanitarian front, we’re working closely with the U.N. and humanitarian organizations to support the people of Ukraine who have been displaced by the violence in Ukraine.</p>



<p>We’re providing &#8212; we’re providing tens of thousands of tons of human supplies &#8212; excuse me, humanitarian supplies &#8212; food, water, medicines &#8212; coming via truck and train every single day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yesterday in Poland, Vice President Harrins &#8212; Harris announced an additional $53 million in additional humanitarian support to Ukraine.&nbsp; That brings the total humanitarian assistance to $107 million in just two weeks.</p>



<p>We’ve joined in this effort by more &#8212; with more than 30 other countries&nbsp;who are providing hundreds of millions more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And last night, to their great credit, the Congress passed a bipartisan spending bill that included an additional $13.6 billion in new assistance to the Ukrainian people.&nbsp; And I look forward to signing that immediately.</p>



<p>And I also want to be clear though: We will make sure Ukraine has weapons to defend against an invading Russian force.&nbsp; We will &#8212; we will send money and food and aid&nbsp;to save the Ukrainian people.&nbsp; And I will welcome the Ukrainian refugees.&nbsp; We should welcome them here with open arms if they need access.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And we’re going to provide more support for Ukraine.&nbsp; We’re going to continue to stand together with our Allies in Europe and send an unmistakable message: We will defend every single inch of NATO territory with the full might of a united and galvanized NATO.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We will not fight a war against Russia in Ukraine.&nbsp; Direct confrontation between NATO and Russia is World War Three, something we must strive to prevent.</p>



<p>But we already know Putin’s war against Ukraine will never be a victory.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He hoped to dominate Ukraine without a fight.&nbsp; He failed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He hoped to fracture European resolve.&nbsp; He failed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He hoped to weaken the transatlantic alliance.&nbsp; He failed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He hoped to split apart American democracies, in terms of our positions.&nbsp; He failed.</p>



<p>The American people are united.&nbsp; The world is united.&nbsp; And we stand with the people of Ukraine.&nbsp; We will not let autocrats and would-be emperors dictate the direction of the world.</p>



<p>Democracies are rising to meet this moment, rallying the world to the side of peace and the side of security.</p>



<p>We’re showing our strength, and we will not falter.</p>



<p>May God bless all of you.&nbsp; God bless Ukraine.&nbsp; And God bless our troops.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; President Biden, your White House has said that Russia may use chemical weapons or create a false-flag operation to use them.&nbsp; What evidence have you seen showing that?&nbsp; And would the U.S. have a military response if Putin does launch a chemical weapons attack?</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; I’m not going to speak about the intelligence.&nbsp; But Russia would pay a severe price if they used chemical weapons.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
