										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p class="has-text-align-center">Roosevelt Room</p>



<p>10:31 A.M. EST<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Good morning.&nbsp; I’m sorry to keep you waiting.&nbsp; I’ve just spoken for some time with President Zelenskyy of Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I told him, as I have each and every time we’ve spoken, the United States stands with the people of Ukraine and their bravely &#8212; as they bravely fight to defend their country.&nbsp; And they are doing that.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>And as Putin continues his merciless assault, the United States and our Allies and partners continue to work in lockstep to ramp up the economic pressure on Putin and to further isolate Russia on the global stage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Later today, together with other NATO Allies and the G7 &#8212; Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom &#8212; as well as the European Union &#8212; we’re going to jointly announce several new steps to squeeze Putin and hold him more &#8212; even more accountable for his aggression against Ukraine.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I want to speak to a few of those points today.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, each of our nations is going to take steps to deny most-favored-nation status to Russia.&nbsp; A most-favored-nation status designation means two countries have agreed to trade with each other under the best possible terms &#8212;&nbsp;low tariffs, few barriers to trade, and the highest possible imports allowed.</p>



<p>In the United States, we call this “permanent normal trade relations” &#8212; PNTR &#8212; but it’s the same thing.&nbsp; Revoking PNTR for Russia is going to make it harder for Russia to do business with the United States.&nbsp; And doing it in unison with other nations that make up half of the global economy will be another crushing blow to the Russian economy that’s already suffering very badly from our sanctions.</p>



<p>And I want to thank Speaker Pelosi, Leader McCarthy, Leader Schumer and McConnell, and Senators Wyden and Crapo, Representatives Neal and Brady for their bipartisan leadership on this in the Congress.</p>



<p>I would like to offer a special thanks to Speaker Pelosi</p>



<p>who has been a strong advocate for revoking PNTR and who agreed to hold off on that in the House until I could line up all of our key allies to keep us in complete unison.  Unity among our allies is critically important, as you all know, from my perspective, at least.<br><br>     Many issues divide us in Washington, but standing for democracy in Ukraine, <s>pushing</s> [punishing] Russia’s aggression should not be one of those issues.</p>



<p>The free world is coming together to confront Putin.&nbsp; Our two parties here at home are leading the way.&nbsp; And with that bipartisan cooperation, I’m looking forward to signing into law the bill revoking PNTR &#8212; which is, again, most people think of it as “most-favored-nations” status.</p>



<p>We’re also taking a further step of banning imports of goods from several signature sectors of the Russian economy, including seafoods, vodka, and diamonds.</p>



<p>And we’re going to continue to squeeze Putin.&nbsp; The G7 will seek to deny Russia the ability to borrow from leading multinational institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.</p>



<p>Putin is an aggressor &#8212; is the aggressor.&nbsp; And Putin must pay the price.</p>



<p>He cannot pursue a war that threatens the very foundations &#8212; which he’s doing &#8212; the very foundations of international peace and stability and then ask for financial help from the international community.</p>



<p>The G7 is also stepping up pressure on corrupt Russian billionaires.&nbsp; We’re adding new names to the list of oligarchs and their families that we’re targeting.&nbsp; And we’re increasing coordination among the G7 countries to target and capture their ill-begotten gains.</p>



<p>They support Putin.&nbsp; They steal from the Russian people.&nbsp; And they seek to hide their money in our countries.&nbsp; They’re part of a &#8212; that kleptocracy that exists in Moscow.&nbsp; And they must share in the pain of these sanctions.</p>



<p>And while we’re going after these &#8212; their superyachts and their vacation homes worth hundreds of milli- &#8212; millions of dollars, we’re also going to make it harder for them to buy high-end products&nbsp;manufactured in our country.&nbsp; We’re banning the export of luxu- &#8212; luxury goods to Russia.&nbsp; They’re also the latest steps we’re taking, but they’re not the last steps we’re going to take.</p>



<p>And as I said at the beginning of all of these steps, we’re going to hit Putin harder because the United States and our closest Allies and partners are acting in unison.</p>



<p>The totality of our sanctions and export controls is crushing the Russian economy.</p>



<p>The ruble has lost more than half its value.&nbsp; They tell me it takes about 200 rubles to equal 1 dollar these days.&nbsp; The Moscow stock exchange has been closed for fully &#8212; for two weeks because they know the moment it opens, it will probably collapse.</p>



<p>Credit rating agencies has downgraded Russia’s government to “junk” status &#8212; its economy to “junk” status.</p>



<p>The list of businesses and international corporations leaving Russia is growing by the day.</p>



<p>We’re also continuing the close <s>corporations</s> [cooperation] with Allies and partners to make sure that the close cooperation we continue to have, the Ukrainian people are &#8212; are able to defend their own nation.</p>



<p>The United States has sent more than $1 billion in security assistance to Ukraine over the last year, including anti-armor and anti-air capabilities &#8212; taking out tanks and planes and helicopters &#8212; with new shipments arriving every day.</p>



<p>We, the United States, are also facilitating significant shipments of security assistance from our Allies and partners to Ukraine.</p>



<p>On the humanitarian front, we’re working closely with the U.N. and humanitarian organizations to support the people of Ukraine who have been displaced by the violence in Ukraine.</p>



<p>We’re providing &#8212; we’re providing tens of thousands of tons of human supplies &#8212; excuse me, humanitarian supplies &#8212; food, water, medicines &#8212; coming via truck and train every single day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yesterday in Poland, Vice President Harrins &#8212; Harris announced an additional $53 million in additional humanitarian support to Ukraine.&nbsp; That brings the total humanitarian assistance to $107 million in just two weeks.</p>



<p>We’ve joined in this effort by more &#8212; with more than 30 other countries&nbsp;who are providing hundreds of millions more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And last night, to their great credit, the Congress passed a bipartisan spending bill that included an additional $13.6 billion in new assistance to the Ukrainian people.&nbsp; And I look forward to signing that immediately.</p>



<p>And I also want to be clear though: We will make sure Ukraine has weapons to defend against an invading Russian force.&nbsp; We will &#8212; we will send money and food and aid&nbsp;to save the Ukrainian people.&nbsp; And I will welcome the Ukrainian refugees.&nbsp; We should welcome them here with open arms if they need access.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And we’re going to provide more support for Ukraine.&nbsp; We’re going to continue to stand together with our Allies in Europe and send an unmistakable message: We will defend every single inch of NATO territory with the full might of a united and galvanized NATO.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We will not fight a war against Russia in Ukraine.&nbsp; Direct confrontation between NATO and Russia is World War Three, something we must strive to prevent.</p>



<p>But we already know Putin’s war against Ukraine will never be a victory.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He hoped to dominate Ukraine without a fight.&nbsp; He failed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He hoped to fracture European resolve.&nbsp; He failed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He hoped to weaken the transatlantic alliance.&nbsp; He failed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He hoped to split apart American democracies, in terms of our positions.&nbsp; He failed.</p>



<p>The American people are united.&nbsp; The world is united.&nbsp; And we stand with the people of Ukraine.&nbsp; We will not let autocrats and would-be emperors dictate the direction of the world.</p>



<p>Democracies are rising to meet this moment, rallying the world to the side of peace and the side of security.</p>



<p>We’re showing our strength, and we will not falter.</p>



<p>May God bless all of you.&nbsp; God bless Ukraine.&nbsp; And God bless our troops.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; President Biden, your White House has said that Russia may use chemical weapons or create a false-flag operation to use them.&nbsp; What evidence have you seen showing that?&nbsp; And would the U.S. have a military response if Putin does launch a chemical weapons attack?</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; I’m not going to speak about the intelligence.&nbsp; But Russia would pay a severe price if they used chemical weapons.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>Today, the United States and African Union (AU) – Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) renewed our partnership by signing an updated Memorandum of Cooperation (MOC) between His Excellency Moussa Faki Mahamat, Chairperson of the African Union Commission (AUC), and U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken. This strategic memorandum signifies a continued and expanded commitment to this partnership by outlining our shared priorities for the a safer, healthier, and more equitable future. Together, we will continue efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Agenda.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the February 2022 AU Heads of State Summit, a resolution was approved to elevate Africa CDC’s status to an autonomous health agency of the African Union – a recognition of its global and regional leadership during the COVID-19 pandemic, Ebola outbreaks, and many other health events. In its support to Member States, Africa CDC serves as a platform to share and exchange knowledge and lessons from public health interventions. Since our partnership officially began in 2015, the U.S. government and Africa CDC have worked together to combat some of the world’s most pressing crises, including Ebola and COVID-19. We have continued to build on our strong relationship through technical assistance, embedded experts and deployed staff to work alongside the organization, and funding to support Africa CDC activities and staffing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, we celebrate ongoing work and highlight&nbsp;key areas of future engagement, including:&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>National Public Health Institutes (NPHIs):&nbsp;</strong>National public health institutes (NPHIs) serve as a functional home for public health activities and the foundation of Africa CDC’s operating model. These science-based agencies monitor the population’s health and respond to disease outbreaks and other public health priorities. They provide leadership and coordination to focus on core public health functions, including surveillance, laboratory, workforce, and public health emergency management. There is natural synergy between Africa CDC and the United States in establishing NPHIs and strengthening their core functions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The United States has also supported Africa CDC’s three-tiered operational model by developing and strengthening NPHIs at the national level and at five Regional Collaborating Centers (RCCs). The RCCs help build capacity of, coordinate public health initiatives with, and coordinate resources among AU Member States. Current Africa CDC initiatives, in partnership with the United States, can address capacity needs of NPHIs, including surveillance networks, health information exchange, early warning systems, and development of testing and diagnostics capacity. Our partnership will help support Africa CDC’s ongoing efforts to expand health security throughout the continent, and help countries reach the goals and target of the Global Health Security Agenda.</p>



<p><strong>Public Health Workforce:&nbsp;</strong>The United States and Africa CDC share the perspective that the public health and healthcare workforce plays a critical role in strengthen health systems, including preparing for and responding to pandemics while continuing to address health needs. The United States works with Africa CDC in building Africa’s public health workforce through supporting global human resources for health, expanding the Field Epidemiology Training Program (FETP), and partnering with Africa CDC’s Institute for Workforce Development (IWD) on other capacity building efforts.</p>



<p><strong>COVID-19:</strong>&nbsp;As part of President Biden’s commitment to leading an international and coordinated vaccine effort, the United States has shared over 166 million COVID-19 vaccine doses with 48 countries in Africa, as of February 2022, with plans for sending more.&nbsp;&nbsp;Africa CDC, in partnership with the African Union, the African Vaccine Acquisition Trust and COVAX, has helped guide allocations of those doses. The United States is supporting updates to regulatory structures and is facilitating engagement with private sector and international organizations that will help expand vaccine manufacturing and enable African public health institutions to produce and supply vaccines for the continent. The U.S. government has partnered with Africa CDC to enhance surveillance and laboratory capacity to identify, detect, and respond to COVID-19 outbreaks and variants of concern. The United States has also deployed staff to support and collaborate with Africa CDC in its leadership of COVID-19 response in Africa.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Critical Medical Commodities:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the United States Government’s Initiative for Global Vaccine Access (Global VAX), we are expanding efforts to work with international partners like Africa CDC to support infrastructure and capacity in vaccine delivery. While we currently work together on COVID-19 vaccine development, these efforts lay the foundation for accelerating the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and other critical medicals tools for a range of diseases.&nbsp;&nbsp;This complements existing work and technical partnerships across Africa for similar efforts to meet immediate and long-term health needs.</p>



<p><strong>Advanced Molecular Detection</strong>: Advanced technologies such as next-generation sequencing and bioinformatics are essential public health tools to help prevent and respond to emerging health threats. Genomics is an increasingly important tool in emerging potential in global public health. The United States, Africa CDC, and other partners have worked together to launch Africa CDC&#8217;s Pathogen Genomics initiative to strengthen laboratory systems and enhance disease surveillance by equipping the continent’s public health institutions with the tools, training, and data infrastructure to fully leverage critical genomic sequencing technologies.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>We the Leaders of the Group of Seven (G7) remain resolved to stand with the Ukrainian people and government who heroically resist Russian President Vladimir Putin’s military aggression and war of choice against their sovereign nation. This unprovoked and unjustified attack is causing enormous suffering and a tragic loss of life, including through the increasingly indiscriminate bombing and shelling of civilians in schools, homes, and hospitals.</p>



<p>We are united in our determination to hold President Putin and his regime accountable for this unjustified and unprovoked war that has already isolated Russia in the world. The world should join together in calling on President Putin and his regime to immediately stop its ongoing assault against Ukraine and withdraw its military forces. We stand in solidarity with those who are bravely opposing the invasion of Ukraine.</p>



<p>We urge Russia to ensure safe and unhindered humanitarian access to victims of its assault in Ukraine, and to allow safe passage for civilians wishing to leave. We call for, and commit to provide, humanitarian, medical and financial support to refugees from Ukraine.</p>



<p>Since President Putin launched the Russian Federation’s invasion on February 24, our countries have imposed expansive restrictive measures that have severely compromised Russia’s economy and financial system, as evidenced by the massive market reactions. We have collectively isolated key Russian banks from the global financial system; blunted the Central Bank of Russia´s ability to utilise its foreign reserves; imposed sweeping export bans and controls that cut Russia off from our advanced technologies; and targeted the architects of this war, that is Russian President Vladimir Putin and his accomplices, as well as the Lukashenko regime in Belarus.</p>



<p>In addition to announced plans, we will make further efforts to reduce our reliance on Russian energy, while ensuring that we do so in an orderly fashion and in ways that provide time for the world to secure alternative and sustainable supplies. In addition, private sector companies are leaving Russia with unprecedented speed and solidarity. We stand with our companies that are seeking an orderly withdrawal from the Russian market.</p>



<p>We remain resolved to isolate Russia further from our economies and the international financial system. Consequently, we commit to taking further measures as soon as possible in the context of our ongoing response and consistent with our respective legal authorities and processes:</p>



<p>First, we will endeavor, consistent with our national processes, to take action that will deny Russia Most-Favoured-Nation status relating to key products.&nbsp;This will revoke important benefits of Russia’s membership of the World Trade Organization and ensure that the products of Russian companies no longer receive Most-Favoured-Nation treatment in our economies. We welcome the ongoing preparation of a statement by a broad coalition of WTO members, including the G7, announcing their revocation of Russia’s Most-Favoured-Nation status.</p>



<p>Second, we are working collectively to prevent Russia from obtaining financing from the leading multilateral financial institutions, including the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Russia cannot grossly violate international law and expect to benefit from being part of the international economic order. We welcome the IMF and World Bank Group’s rapid and ongoing efforts to get financial assistance to Ukraine. We also welcome the steps the OECD has taken to restrict Russia’s participation in relevant bodies.</p>



<p>Third, we commit to continuing our campaign of pressure against Russian elites, proxies and oligarchs close to President Putin and other architects of the war as well as their families and their enablers. We commend the work done by many of our governments to identify and freeze mobile and immobile assets belonging to sanctioned individuals and entities, and resolve to continue this campaign of pressure as a matter of priority. To that end, we have operationalised the task force announced on February 26, which will target the assets of Russian elites close to President Putin and the architects of his war. Our sanctions packages are carefully targeted so as not to impede the delivery of humanitarian assistance.</p>



<p>Fourth, we commit to maintaining the effectiveness of our restrictive measures, to cracking down on evasion and to closing loop-holes. Specifically, in addition to other measures planned to prevent evasion, we will ensure that the Russian state and elites, proxies and oligarchs cannot leverage digital assets as a means of evading or offsetting the impact of international sanctions, which will further limit their access to the global financial system. It is commonly understood that our current sanctions already cover crypto-assets. We commit to taking measures to better detect and interdict any illicit activity, and we will impose costs on illicit Russian actors using digital assets to enhance and transfer their wealth, consistent with our national processes.</p>



<p>Fifth, we are resolved to fighting off the Russian regime’s attempts to spread disinformation. We affirm and support the right of the Russian people to free and unbiased information.</p>



<p>Sixth, we stand ready to impose further restrictions on exports and imports of key goods and technologies on the Russian Federation, which aim at denying Russia revenues and at ensuring that our citizens are not underwriting President Putin’s war, consistent with national processes. We note that international companies are already withdrawing from the Russian market. We will make sure that the elites, proxies and oligarchs that support President Putin’s war are deprived of their access to luxury goods and assets. The elites who sustain Putin’s war machine should no longer be able to reap the gains of this system, squandering the resources of the Russian people.</p>



<p>Seventh, Russian entities directly or indirectly supporting the war should not have access to new debt and equity investments and other forms of international capital. Our citizens are united in the view that their savings and investments should not fund the companies that underpin Russia’s economy and war machine. We will continue working together to develop and implement measures that will further limit Russia’s ability to raise money internationally.</p>



<p>We stand united and in solidarity with our partners, including developing and emerging economies, which unjustly bear the cost and impact of this war, for which we hold President Putin, his regime and supporters, and the Lukashenko regime, fully responsible. Together, we will work to preserve stability of energy markets as well as food security globally as Russia’s invasion threatens Ukraine’s capacity to grow crops this year.</p>



<p>We continue to stand with the Ukrainian people and the Government of Ukraine. We will continue to evaluate the impacts of our measures, including on third countries, and are prepared to take further measures to hold President Putin and his regime accountable for his attack on Ukraine.</p>

<p>Today, President Biden and G7 Leaders from Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom as well as the European Union will announce new economic actions to hold Putin accountable for his continued assault on Ukraine and further isolate Russia from the global financial system. Each partner will implement actions consistent with their national processes.</p>



<p>These actions will collectively ramp up pressure on Putin and build on the unprecedented package of economic sanctions and export controls the United States and over 30 countries have already imposed on Russia. Today, the ruble is trading at its weakest level ever and is worth less than a penny; the Russian stock market is closed for the longest time in history; the Russian government’s credit rating has been downgraded to “junk” status, and we’re seeing a mass exodus from Russia by the private sector – the result of our historic, multilateral coordination and commitment to ensure that Putin’s war of choice is a strategic failure. Russia has now become a global economic and financial pariah. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Today’s announcements include:</p>



<p><strong>Revoking Russia’s Most-Favored Nation Status.&nbsp;</strong>President Biden will work closely with Congress to deny Russia the benefits of its WTO membership and ensure that Russian imports do not receive most favored nation treatment in our economy. The United States Congress has demonstrated bipartisan leadership to revoke Permanent Normal Trade Relations for Russia, and President Biden looks forward to signing a bill into law. Together with similar actions by the G7, following our respective national processes, this collective action by more than half of the global economy will deliver another serious economic blow to Russia.</p>



<p><strong>Denying Borrowing Privileges at Multilateral Financial Institutions.&nbsp;</strong>The G7 Leaders will agree to ensure Russia cannot obtain financing from the leading multilateral financial institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Russia cannot grossly violate international law and expect to benefit from being part of the international economic order.</p>



<p><strong>Full blocking Sanctions on Additional Russian Elites and their Family Members</strong>. This includes Yuri Kovalchuk, executives of banks we have sanctioned, and Duma members who sponsored legislation to recognize the so-called “Donetsk People’s Republic” and “Luhansk People’s Republic.” This action will follow up on multiple efforts, along with those of our allies and partners, to target Russian elites and their family members who are profiting from this war of choice, and cuts them off from the U.S. financial system, freezes any assets they hold in the United States and blocks their travel to the United States. We will work through the international task force announced on February 26 to pursue the ill-gotten gains of these elites.<br><br><strong>Ban Export of Luxury Goods to Russia.&nbsp;</strong>President Biden will sign an Executive Order (E.O) that will end the exportation of luxury items to any person located in the Russian Federation. This will ensure that U.S. persons are not providing luxury items, such as high end-watches, luxury vehicles, high-end apparel, high-end alcohol, jewelry, and other goods frequently purchased by Russian elites. The U.S. export value of the products covered by today’s luxury goods restrictions is nearly $550 million per year. The elites who sustain Putin’s war machine should no longer be able to reap the gains of this system and squander the resources of the Russian people.</p>



<p><strong>Ban U.S. Import of Goods from Several Signature Sectors of Russia’s Economy.&nbsp;</strong>President Biden’s E.O. will also prohibit the import of goods from several signature sectors of Russia’s economy – including seafood, spirits/vodka, and non-industrial diamonds. This will deny Russia more than $1 billion in export revenues and ensure U.S. citizens are not underwriting Putin’s war. The United States retains the authority to impose additional import bans as appropriate.</p>



<p><strong>New guidance by the Department of Treasury to Thwart Sanctions Evasion, including through Virtual Currency.</strong>&nbsp;The Department of the Treasury, through new guidance, will continue to make clear that Treasury’s expansive actions against Russia require all U.S. persons to comply with sanctions regulations regardless of whether a transaction is denominated in traditional fiat currency or virtual currency. Treasury is closely monitoring any efforts to circumvent or violate Russia-related sanctions, including through the use of virtual currency, and is committed to using its broad enforcement authorities to act against violations and to promote compliance. &nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Create the Authority to Ban New Investment in Any Sector of the Russian Federation Economy</strong>. President Biden has already banned new U.S. investments in the Russian energy sector. This E.O. will establish the legal authority for future investment restrictions in any sector of the Russian economy, as may be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, by a United States person.</p>

<p>On 7-8 March, the United Kingdom and United States held high-level consultations on the Indo-Pacific. The U.S. delegation was led by Indo-Pacific Coordinator Kurt Campbell and included representatives from the Department of State, Department of Defense, and National Security Council. The UK delegation was led by Deputy National Security Advisor David Quarrey and included representatives from across Her Majesty’s Government. Officials from both governments resolved to broaden and deepen their alignment and cooperation on and in the region. They welcomed growing coordination among allies and partners across the Atlantic and the Pacific. In particular, they noted unprecedented commitments from Indo-Pacific countries—including Japan, Australia, the Republic of Korea, New Zealand, and Singapore—to support Ukraine and to impose costs on Russia for its brutal and unprovoked attack. They also noted that these steps come at a time when the U.S., UK and European partners are enhancing their engagement with the Indo-Pacific and preparing to meet the challenge of systemic competition with China.</p>



<p>U.S. and UK officials committed to coordinate implementation of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Strategy and the UK’s Indo-Pacific tilt, as set out in its Integrated Review. They noted progress made on AUKUS and reaffirmed their commitment at the highest level to ensuring the delivery of conventionally-armed nuclear-powered submarines and other advanced capabilities to promote security and stability in the region. They agreed to pursue positive economic engagement in the Indo-Pacific, including through supporting just green transitions as part of the Clean Green Initiative and Build Back Better World agendas; to collaborate on critical and emerging technologies; to ensure economic security; and to oppose economic coercion. They reaffirmed the importance of the maintenance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. They also discussed Hong Kong. In the coming months, the U.S. and the UK will work together to invest in partnerships with the Pacific Islands; to support the centrality of ASEAN and to advance concrete cooperation with ASEAN and its member states; and to enhance ties with India.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>To reinforce their commitment and sustain it in the long term, the United States and the United Kingdom agreed to inaugurate a continuing dialogue on the Indo-Pacific. The dialogue will be led in the U.S. Government by the National Security Council and the Department of State and in Her Majesty’s Government by the National Security Secretariat and the Foreign, Commonwealth, and Development Office.</p>

<p>From its first day in office, the Biden-Harris Administration has made delivering equitable relief to hard-hit small businesses a top priority. The latest data show that the Administration’s focus has resulted in a stunning turnaround from the previous Administration.</p>



<p>The pandemic was devastating to America’s small businesses and by January 2021, thousands of small businesses had closed, the unemployment rate was at 6.4 percent, and millions of Americans remained out of the workforce. While Congress had appropriated billions in small business relief in 2020, mom and pop businesses and those owned by women and entrepreneurs of color too often had been shut out of earlier relief efforts in the prior Administration. An&nbsp;<a href="https://coronavirus.house.gov/sites/democrats.coronavirus.house.gov/files/PPP%20Report%20Final%20%283%29.pdf">October 2020 report</a>&nbsp;issued by the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis found that the prior Administration encouraged banks to limit their Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) lending to existing customers, which ultimately excluded many minority and women-owned businesses across the country. The subcommittee also noted that, under the prior Administration, the Small Business Administration (SBA) and Treasury Department failed to issue guidance prioritizing underserved markets.</p>



<p>This Administration has put equity at the heart of the delivery of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sba.gov/article/2022/jan/20/one-year-later-biden-harris-administration-sba-have-prioritized-equitable-recovery-centered">more than $450 billion in small business relief</a>&nbsp;since taking office. Within weeks of Inauguration,&nbsp;the Administration&nbsp;announced a number of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/02/22/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-increases-lending-to-small-businesses-in-need-announces-changes-to-ppp-to-further-promote-equitable-access-to-relief/">policy changes</a>&nbsp;to target the PPP to the smallest businesses and companies that have been left behind in previous relief efforts. Recent reports by the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-21-601.pdf">independent Government Accountability Office</a>&nbsp;and academics&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w29732?utm_campaign=ntwh&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=ntwg11">Robert Fairlie and Frank Fossen</a>&nbsp;found that&nbsp;<strong>Biden-Harris reforms to PPP helped result in a substantially higher share of loans going to small businesses in underserved communities, including communities of color.</strong></p>



<p>Specifically, the reforms helped:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Increase loans to small businesses in low to moderate income (LMI) communities by 62 percent.</strong>  In 2021, the PPP made 2 million loans to businesses located in LMI communities, a 62 percent increase from the 1.2 million loans made to businesses in these communities in 2020.</li><li><strong>Expand lending to the smallest businesses by 35 percent.</strong>  6 million businesses with less than 20 employees received PPP loans in 2021, a 35 percent increase from the 4.5 million loans made to these businesses in 2020. More than 95 percent of 2021 PPP loans went to these businesses.  </li><li><strong>Triple lending to microbusinesses.  </strong>Nearly two-thirds of 2021 PPP loans went to Schedule C businesses, providing roughly 4 million of the smallest businesses – 35 percent in LMI areas – with $60 billion in forgivable loans. This tripled the amount of funding from the roughly $20 billion that went to Schedule C businesses in 2020.   </li><li><strong>Reduce the average loan size by more than half</strong>.  Thanks to the SBA’s success in reaching smaller businesses than under the previous Administration, the average PPP loan size under the Biden-Harris Administration was $42.5K. This was down more than 50 percent from the $101.5K average in the 2020 round of PPP. This reduction in average loan demonstrates that PPP reached more of the smallest businesses under the Biden-Harris Administration.</li><li><strong>Increase loans to rural small businesses by 40 percent.</strong>  The number of PPP loans made to rural small businesses was up 40 percent from 2020, from 1 million in 2020 to 1.4 million loans made in 2021.</li><li><strong>Expand the number loans made by community financial institutions by a factor of 6.</strong>  The number of PPP loans made by community financial institutions and minority depository institutions increased from more than 240,000 loans in 2020 to nearly 1.4 million loans in 2021.  The loan volume nearly doubled, from $17.5 billion in 2020 to $29.9 billion in 2021 even as the overall size of the PPP program ($271 billion) decreased by nearly 50 percent from the $521 billion in loans made in 2020.  </li></ul>



<p>Overall, these changes ensured that the 2021 round of the PPP – which consisted of more than $271 billion in forgivable loans to nearly 6.4 million businesses – reached more of the smallest businesses and those located in low and moderate income (LMI) communities.</p>



<p>These efforts build upon the Biden-Administration’s overall efforts to help small businesses navigate the ups and downs of the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2021, the Administration distributed more than $450 billion in critical relief to more than 6 million small businesses through the Small Business Administration.&nbsp;In addition to PPP, this relief included:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>$28.5 billion to 100,000 restaurants, food trucks, street food vendors, breweries, and other food service businesses through the Restaurant Revitalization Fund.&nbsp;27 percent of these businesses were located in LMI areas and 15 percent were from rural communities.</li><li>Providing $14.2 billion in grants to nearly 13,000 theaters, live venues and other entertainment and cultural hubs.&nbsp; More than 90 percent of these grantees, or roughly 11,600, have 50 employees or less. These smallest of businesses received a total of $8.5 billion in awards.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Providing more than 600,000 of the small business hardest hit by the pandemic with more than $7.5 billion in small grants through the Targeted Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) Advance program. All of these businesses are located in LMI areas.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Providing more than $125 billion in low interest, long-term loans through the COVID EIDL program to more than 650,000 small businesses. Overall, 95 percent of COVID EIDL borrowers have less than 20 employees, nearly one-fourth were located in LMI areas, and 14 percent were in rural communities.</li></ul>
