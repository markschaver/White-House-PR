<p>Our hearts are heavy today as we let you all know that our beloved German Shepherd, Champ, passed away peacefully at home. He was our constant, cherished companion during the last 13 years and was adored by the entire Biden family. Even as Champ’s strength waned in his last months, when we came into a room, he would immediately pull himself up, his tail always wagging, and nuzzle us for an ear scratch or a belly rub. Wherever we were, he wanted to be, and everything was instantly better when he was next to us. He loved nothing more than curling up at our feet in front of a fire at the end of the day, joining us as a comforting presence in meetings, or sunning himself in the White House garden. In his younger days, he was happiest chasing golf balls on the front lawn of the Naval Observatory or racing to catch our grandchildren as they ran around our backyard in Delaware. In our most joyful moments and in our most grief-stricken days, he was there with us, sensitive to our every unspoken feeling and emotion. We love our sweet, good boy and will miss him always. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">State Dining Room</p>



<p>2:53 P.M. EDT</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT: Good afternoon. (Clears throat.) Excuse me. I’m pleased to announce that today we will have reached the mark of 300 million shots in the arms in just 150 days. Let me say that again: 300 million shots in arms in under 150 days.</p>



<p>It’s an important milestone that just didn’t happen on its own or by chance. It took the ingenuity of American scientists, the full capacity of American companies, and a whole-of-government response across federal, state, Tribal, and local governments.</p>



<p>Together, we built an unparalleled vaccination program and managed one of the biggest and most complicated logistical challenges in American history.</p>



<p>And above all, we got here because of the American people stepping up and getting vaccinated &#8212; helping family, friends, neighbors get vaccinated.</p>



<p>Just remember what the situation was like 150 days ago. We didn’t have enough vaccine supply for all Americans. We didn’t have the vaccine infrastructure or the people to administer the vaccines or the places where the people could get vaccinated. But we turned it around together by acting quickly and aggressively and equitably.</p>



<p>We secured enough vaccine supply for every American. And as I announced last week during my visit to Europe, we are now in a position to provide more than one half billion vaccine doses to the rest of the world &#8212; the 100 poorest nations.</p>



<p>We’ve developed and deployed over 9,000 federal personnel, including 5,100 active duty military, to support the vaccine effort and to get shots into arms. And now, we have more than 81,000 vaccination sites across the country, including over 42,000 local pharmacies.</p>



<p>Thanks to this wartime response, we have gotten 300 million shots in the arms of Americans in 150 days, months ahead of what most anyone thought was possible when we started.</p>



<p>In fact, if you remember, a lot of people were skeptical that we could even get 100 million shots in my first 100 days into people’s arms. But we did it. We kept going. And what we’re seeing is a truly American accomplishment.</p>



<p>Sixty-five percent &#8212; sixty-five percent &#8212; of American adults have gotten at least one shot, including eighty-seven percent of our seniors.</p>



<p>Just five months ago, we were at only 5 percent of adult Americans. Fifteen states and the District of Columbia have now reached at least 70 percent vaccination rate in their state. Twenty-six states and D.C. have fully vaccinated &#8212; (clears throat) &#8212; excuse me &#8212; 50 percent or more of the adults.</p>



<p>Nationwide, we have the lowest number of daily deaths<br>since the first days of the pandemic.</p>



<p>And we’ve built equity into the heart of our vaccination program from day one. Seventy-three percent of the shots administered at community health centers through the federal program and more than fifty-eight percent of the shots administered by federally-run vaccination sites have gone to people of color. And across the nation, people of color have accounted for more than half of all vaccinations in the last month. That’s important progress, but we have much more to do.</p>



<p>Vice President Harris is, as I speak &#8212; is in Atlanta, getting the word out about the vaccinations.</p>



<p>Yesterday, I signed a bill &#8212; (clears throat) &#8212; excuse me &#8212; into law making Juneteenth a federal holiday.</p>



<p>And this weekend, folks in communities across the country are going to be canvassing and hosting events to encourage their families, friends, and neighbors to get vaccinated. The more we close the racial gap in vaccination rates, the more lives we’ll save.</p>



<p>And as our vaccination program is saying &#8212; saving tens of thousands of lives, with that count growing each day, it’s also allowing millions of Americans to get back to living their lives. Grandparents hugging their kids. Kids back to school and getting ready for the summer. People going out to restaurants and traveling. Businesses are reopening.</p>



<p>Folks, we’re heading into a very different summer compared to last year. A bright summer. Prayerfully, a summer of joy.</p>



<p>But as I promised you from the beginning, I will always give it to you straight: the good, the bad, and the truth. And the truth is that deaths and hospitalizations are drastically down in places where people are getting vaccinated. But unfortunately, cases and hospitalizations are not going down<br>in many places in the lower-vaccination-rate states. They&#8217;re actually going up in some places.</p>



<p>A few days ago, we crossed 600,000 &#8212; 600,000 Americans dead from COVID, more than every death in World War One, World War Two, Vietnam, and 9/11 combined. So even while we’re making incredible progress, it remains a serious and deadly threat.</p>



<p>And the data is clear: If you are unvaccinated, you&#8217;re at risk of getting seriously ill or dying or spreading it. People getting seriously ill and being hospitalized due to COVID-19 are those who have not been fully vaccinated. The new variant will leave unvaccinated people even more vulnerable than they are a month ago &#8212; over a month ago.</p>



<p>This is a serious concern, especially because of what experts are calling the &#8220;Delta&#8221; vir- &#8212; the &#8220;Delta&#8221; variant. It’s a variant that is more easily transmissible, potentially deadlier, and particularly dangerous for young people.</p>



<p>But the good news is, we have the solution.The science and the data are clear: The best way to protect yourself against these variants are to get fully vaccinated.</p>



<p>So, please, please, if you have one shot, get the second shot as soon as you can so you&#8217;re fully vaccinated. And if you haven’t gotten vaccinated yet, get vaccinated now. Now. Don’t put it off. It’s free. It’s easy. It’s convenient.</p>



<p>And as I said many times, text your ZIP Code to the numbers 438829 &#8212; 438829 &#8212; to find the sites where you can get vaccinated closest to you. Get your free Uber or Lyft ride to and from vaccination sites. I want to thank Uber and Lyft for their cooperation.</p>



<p>Use the extended hours at thousands of pharmacies in June, including thousands that are open 24/7 on Friday of this month. Most pharmacies now offer walk-in vaccinations. No appointment is needed.</p>



<p>Employers with less than 500 employees: The federal government is providing you a tax credit to give your workers paid time off to get vaccinated and recover if they need be.</p>



<p>And for anyone who still questions, that’s okay if you still have questions. But act &#8212; act now. Act now. Talk to your family and friends who’ve gotten the vac- &#8212; gotten vaccinated. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist.</p>



<p>According to the American Medical Association, over 90 percent of physicians are fully vaccinated. They&#8217;re making the choice to protect themselves and their communities and their patients. Follow their lead and make the choice for yourself.</p>



<p>As I said, we’re heading into, God willing, the summer of joy, a summer of freedom. On July 4, we’re going to celebrate our independence from the virus as we celebrate our independence of our nation. We want everyone &#8212; everyone to be able to do that.</p>



<p>Let’s remember, we are the United States of America. Let’s get this done &#8212; all of us, together.</p>



<p>God bless you all. And may God protect our troops. Thank you.</p>



<p>Q Could the Delta variant force us back into lockdown?</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT: I don&#8217;t think so because so many people have already been vaccinated, but the Delta variant can cause more people to die in areas where people have not been vaccinated. Where people have gotten the two shots, the Delta variant is highly unlikely to result in anything, other than &#8212; I mean, as &#8212; the existing vaccines are very effective.</p>



<p>So, no, it&#8217;s not a lockdown, but some areas will be very hurt.</p>



<p>Q Sir, any comment about (inaudible) what the Catholic Bishops have done? Are you concerned about this rift within the Catholic Church? And are you concerned about this action?</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT: Say again.</p>



<p>Q The Catholic Bishops are moving on this resolution that would prevent you and others who&#8217;ve supported abortion from receiving communion. Are you concerned about the rift in the Catholic Church? And how do you feel personally about that?</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT: That&#8217;s a private matter, and I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s going to happen. Thank you.</p>



<p>Q Mr. President, have you seen the infrastructure plan on Capitol Hill &#8212; the bipartisan plan? Do you have any reaction to that?</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT: I&#8217;ll tell you Monday when I get a copy of it.</p>

<p>The idea that we have held back security assistance to Ukraine is nonsense. Just last week—in the run-up to the U.S.-Russia Summit—we provided a $150 million package of security assistance, including lethal assistance. We have now provided the entire amount appropriated by Congress through the Ukraine security assistance initiative. Two days before the Summit, President Biden stood on the stage before the entire world at NATO and said that we would keep putting Ukraine “in the position to be able to continue to resist Russian physical aggression.” We have also prepared contingency funds in the event of a further Russian incursion into Ukraine. As President Biden told President Putin directly, we will stand unwavering in support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>When President Biden took office 150 days ago, more than 3,300 Americans were dying each day, more than 185,000 Americans were infected with COVID-19 cases a day, and the economy had lost millions of jobs.<br><br>Today, thanks to the President’s COVID-19 strategy, the virus is in retreat. 300 million shots have been administered in 150 days, COVID-19 cases and deaths have decreased by more than 90 percent, and the economy is experiencing the strongest rebound in decades.<br><br>This did not happen by accident. The President committed to the American people that he would confront this unprecedented challenge with the full strength and capabilities of the federal government. Each day since taking office, the President has done just that – mobilizing a whole-of-government, wartime effort to defeat COVID-19. And, he has brought all Americans, including public and private sector leaders, together and asked them to do their part.<br><br>The results are clear: America is starting to look like America again, and entering a summer of joy and freedom.<br><br><strong>300 Million Shots in 150 Days</strong><br><br>When President Biden took office, about 5% of adult Americans had gotten vaccinated. At the pace the U.S. was vaccinating in January, it would have taken 336 days to get to 300 million shots in arms. And, inadequate vaccine supply, vaccinators, and places to get vaccinated severely limited Americans’ access to vaccines.<br><br>Thanks to the Biden Administration’s whole-of-government effort to stand up a first-of-its-kind, best-in-class nationwide vaccination program, today, more than 175 million Americans have gotten at least one COVID-19 vaccine shot.</p>



<ul><li>65% of adult Americans have at least one shot, and 55% of adults are fully vaccinated.</li><li>87% of seniors and 74% of adults age 40 and over have at least one shot.</li><li>15 states and Washington, D.C., have gotten at least 70% of adults one shot.</li><li>26 states and D.C. have fully vaccinated 50% or more of adults.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Importantly, this progress on vaccinations has brought COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths down to their lowest levels since the start of the pandemic last year. It’s curbed the spread of the virus, saved tens of thousands of lives, and allowed tens of millions of Americans to get back to living their life.<br><br>This is a direct result of the Biden Administration’s whole-of-government, wartime effort that focused on:<br><br><strong>Securing enough supply for all Americans and getting it out the door as quickly as possible.</strong>&nbsp;When President Biden took office, there was not enough vaccine supply for all Americans, and states were not getting the supply allocation and delivery timeline information they requested and needed to be successful. Thanks to the President’s aggressive actions, the Biden Administration secured enough supply for all Americans, dramatically increased supply to states, and gave states more visibility into allocation numbers to allow for better planning to get shots into arms much faster. This allowed the President to make all adults eligible for vaccination in mid-April – months ahead of expectations – and has positioned the U.S. to help lead the global efforts to vaccinate the world.<br><br><strong>Mobilizing Americans to get shots in arms.</strong>&nbsp;The Biden Administration has deployed over 9,000 federal personnel to support vaccinations, including over 5,100 active duty troops. A total of 2,500 federal staff have served as vaccinators. Thanks in part to the American Rescue Plan, the Administration has funded over 30,000 National Guard members who have supported COVID-19 response efforts in states and territories, with 2,300 National Guard members serving as vaccinators. The President also used his authority under the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act to permit additional health care providers, including retired doctors and dentists, to administer shots in arms across the country.<br><br><strong>Dramatically increasing the number of vaccination sites so that at least 90% of Americans have access to a shot within 5 miles of where they live.</strong>&nbsp;Today, with more than 81,000 vaccination sites in communities across the country, and thousands of sites offering no-appointment, walk-in vaccinations, it has never been easier to get vaccinated in America. The Biden Administration achieved this by:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Launching a federal pharmacy vaccination program and expanding it to 42,000 local pharmacies that have administered more than 82 million shots in arms. </strong>More than 75% of these pharmacies are offering no-appointment, walk-in vaccinations, and over 5,600 are offering extended hours on Fridays in June, including many open 24 hours on these days.<br> </li><li><strong>Standing up 39 federally-run, high-volume vaccination sites in 27 states.</strong> These sites – stood up by FEMA and run in conjunction with the U.S. military and state and local partners – were all located in the most vulnerable neighborhoods in America. More than 5.6 million shots have been administered at these sites.<br> </li><li><strong>Launching a community health center vaccination program and expanding it to about 1,100 centers that have administered almost 5 million shots. </strong>Two-thirds of the population that these centers serve are living at or below the federal poverty line and 60% are racial and/or ethnic minorities. More than 70% of shots administered through the program have gone to racial and ethnic minorities, and these centers have hosted almost 11,000 pop-up clinics to reach the most vulnerable communities.<br> </li><li><strong>Meeting people where they are.</strong> The Biden Administration has supported more than 20,000 community-based pop-up vaccination clinics, including through FEMA, Veterans Affairs, and the pharmacy and community health center programs. These clinics, which have gotten over 3.6 million shots in arms, meet people where they are, including at places of work, worship, and recreation.<br> </li><li><strong>Providing funding, equipment and/or personnel to help states expand and scale up their own vaccination efforts. </strong>Thanks in part to the American Rescue Plan, the Biden Administration has provided over $4.8 billion in funding to 57 states, localities, Tribes and territories to support and increase their vaccination efforts. In total, FEMA has provided critical support to over 2,200 community vaccination centers nationwide.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Advancing equity.</strong>&nbsp;The Biden Administration has put equity at the center of every aspect of its response, including its vaccination program. More than 70% of the shots provided to community health centers through the federal program have been administered to people of color and more than 58% of the shots administered at federally-run sites have gone to people of color. More than 40% of pharmacies participating in the federal program are located in high-risk zip codes, and pharmacies have conducted over 8,100 pop-up vaccination clinics to support vaccination of essential workers and other communities disproportionately impacted by COVID-19. And, in the past month alone, people of color have accounted for 54% of nationwide vaccinations, while only making up 40% of the U.S. population. The Biden Administration is also:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Investing in community health centers.</strong>&nbsp;The Administration has invested more than $6 billion in American Rescue Plan (ARP) funding in Community Health Centers to expand access to COVID-19 vaccines, testing, and treatment for vulnerable populations<br>&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Bolstering the response in rural communities.</strong>&nbsp;The Administration has provided nearly $860 million in ARP funding to help rural health clinics and rural hospitals broaden their COVID-19 testing and mitigation to slow the spread of the virus in their communities; and $100 million in ARP funding to approximately 4,600 rural health clinics across the country to support vaccine outreach in rural communities.<br>&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Combatting COVID-19 in Indian Country.</strong>&nbsp;The Administration has invested nearly $6 billion in ARP funding to support Tribal communities in their fight against the virus, including $600 million for the Indian Health Service to increase vaccinations.<br>&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Building vaccine confidence in the hardest-hit and highest-risk communities.</strong>&nbsp;The Administration has provided $3 billion to expand vaccination outreach to underserved communities through the CDC and another $1 billion to help build vaccine confidence.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Ensuring getting vaccinated is easy and convenient and that the American people have the information and confidence they need to get vaccinated.</strong>Thanks in part to the ARP, the Biden Administration has provided more than $4 billion to state and local health agencies, national, community- and faith-based organizations to conduct vaccine education and outreach efforts in communities across the country and build Americans’ confidence in the vaccines. In addition, the Administration has worked with the private and public sector to provide Americans free transportation to and from vaccine sites, increase the availability of no-appointment, walk-in vaccinations, and promote paid time-off and free child care for vaccinations, and much more. &nbsp;These efforts have paid off: At the beginning of this year, only 34% of Americans wanted to get vaccinated as soon as possible. Five months later, we not only increased that number dramatically, the Biden Administration has vaccinated 65% of adults.<br><br><strong>WHAT AMERICANS WERE READING IN JANUARY</strong></p>

<p>Like so many fathers, my dad was a man of decency, honor, generosity, and kindness. &nbsp;He had a profound impact on me, and instilled in me the understanding of the basic truth that everyone is entitled to be treated with dignity and respect. &nbsp;The value set my father taught me, I taught to my children and&nbsp;my grandchildren. &nbsp;I hold his words, his wisdom, and his influence in my heart every day and every time I sign my name as&nbsp;President, Joseph R. Biden, Jr.</p>



<p>Father&#8217;s Day is a time to recognize, appreciate, and celebrate the fathers and father figures in our lives who lift us up on their shoulders and shape our lives for the better.&nbsp; We thank the dads who have guided, taught, coached, cared for us, and supported us through life&#8217;s trials and tribulations. &nbsp;And, we celebrate all that they impart: &nbsp;character and perspective, lessons borne from experience, and the sacrifices made from love.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We also know this can be a hard day for many &#8212; for those who have lost a father, a grandfather, a stepfather, or a fatherly role model; and for those fathers who have lost a child of their own.&nbsp; During the past year, too many families lost fathers too soon because of and during this pandemic.&nbsp; We think of&nbsp;them today and every day, and we honor their enduring memories and legacies.</p>



<p>My Administration is committed to strengthening American families and easing the burdens of caregiving, so that more fathers and mothers can raise children while pursuing fulfilling lives and careers of their own.&nbsp; The American Families Plan would provide 12 weeks of paid family leave, so that all parents who work outside the home can spend precious time with their newborn children or care for their children and other loved ones&nbsp;when they get sick.&nbsp; By investing in our caregiving infrastructure, we can help ensure that no father or mother has to choose between putting food on the table or caring for their children.&nbsp; My Administration is also committed to helping single moms and dads, many of whom shoulder all of the parenting responsibility in their children&#8217;s lives, sacrificing greatly to&nbsp;ensure that their kids have the same opportunities as everyone else.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, we express our appreciation for the fathers, stepfathers, grandfathers, and father figures who enrich our&nbsp;character, love us unconditionally, and give so much of themselves every day so we can live lives worthy of their dreams&nbsp;and sacrifices. &nbsp;</p>



<p>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, in accordance with a joint resolution of the Congress approved April 24, 1972, as amended (36 U.S.C. 109), do hereby proclaim June 20, 2021, as Father&#8217;s Day.&nbsp; I&nbsp;direct the appropriate officials of the Government to display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings on this day.&nbsp; Let us remember our fathers, living and deceased, and&nbsp;give them the honor and gratitude they deserve.</p>



<p>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighteenth day of June, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-fifth.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-right">JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>On June 19, 1865 &#8212; nearly nine decades after our Nation&#8217;s founding, and more than 2 years after President Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation &#8212; enslaved Americans in&nbsp;Galveston, Texas, finally received word that they were free from bondage. &nbsp;As those who were formerly enslaved were recognized for the first time as citizens, Black Americans came to commemorate Juneteenth with&nbsp;celebrations across the country, building new lives and a&nbsp;new tradition that we honor today. &nbsp;In its celebration of freedom, Juneteenth is a day that should be recognized by all Americans. And that is why I am proud to have consecrated Juneteenth as our newest national holiday.</p>



<p>Juneteenth is a day of profound weight and power.</p>



<p>A day in which we remember the moral stain and terrible toll of slavery on our country –- what I&#8217;ve long called America&#8217;s original sin. &nbsp;A long legacy of systemic racism, inequality, and inhumanity.</p>



<p>But it is a day that also reminds us of our incredible capacity to heal, hope, and emerge from our darkest moments with purpose and resolve.</p>



<p>As I said on the 100th Anniversary of the Tulsa Race Massacre, great nations don&#8217;t ignore the most painful chapters of their past. Great nations confront them. &nbsp;We come to terms with them.</p>



<p>On Juneteenth, we recommit ourselves to the work of equity, equality, and justice.&nbsp; And, we celebrate the centuries of&nbsp;struggle, courage, and hope that have brought us to this time&nbsp;of progress and possibility. &nbsp;That work has been led throughout our history by abolitionists and educators, civil&nbsp;rights advocates and lawyers, courageous activists and&nbsp;trade unionists, public officials, and everyday Americans who have helped make real the ideals of our founding documents for all.</p>



<p>There is still more work to do. &nbsp;As we emerge from the long, dark winter of the COVID-19 pandemic, for example, racial equity remains at the heart of our efforts to vaccinate the Nation and beat the virus. &nbsp;We must recognize that Black Americans, among other people of color, have shouldered a disproportionate burden of loss &#8212; while also carrying us through disproportionately as essential workers and health care providers on the front lines of the crisis.</p>



<p>Psalm 30 proclaims that &#8220;weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.&#8221;&nbsp; Juneteenth marks both the long, hard night of slavery and discrimination, and the promise of a&nbsp;brighter morning to come.&nbsp; My Administration is committed to&nbsp;building an economy &#8212; and a Nation &#8212; that brings everyone along, and finally delivers our Nation&#8217;s founding promise to Black Americans.&nbsp; Together, we will lay the roots of real and lasting justice, so that we can become the extraordinary country that was promised to all Americans.</p>



<p>Juneteenth not only commemorates the past.&nbsp; It calls us to action today.</p>



<p>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in&nbsp;me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 19, 2021, as Juneteenth Day of Observance.&nbsp; I call upon the people of the United States to acknowledge and celebrate the end of the Civil War and the emancipation of Black Americans, and commit together to eradicate systemic racism that still undermines our founding ideals and collective prosperity.</p>



<p>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighteenth day of June, in the year of our Lord two&nbsp;thousand&nbsp;twenty-one, and of the Independence of the United&nbsp;States of&nbsp;America the two&nbsp;hundred and forty-fifth.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-right">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">East Room</p>



<p>3:51 P.M. EDT</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, thank you, thank you.<br><br>Well, thank you, Madam Vice President.<br><br>One hundred and fifty-six years ago &#8212; one hundred and fifty-six years &#8212; June 19th, 1865 &#8212; John, thanks for being here &#8212; a major general of the Union Army arrived in Galveston, Texas, to enforce the Emancipation Proclamation and free the last enslaved Americans in Texas from bondage. A day, as you all know &#8212; I’m going to repeat some of what was said &#8212; that became known as Juneteenth. You all know that. A day that reflects what the Psalm tell us: “Weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.”<br><br>Juneteenth marks both the long, hard night of slavery and subjugation, and a promise of a brighter morning to come. This is a day of profound &#8212; in my view &#8212; profound weight and profound power.<br><br>A day in which we remember the moral stain, the terrible toll that slavery took on the country and continues to take &#8212; what I’ve long called “America’s original sin.”<br><br>At the same time, I also remember the extraordinary capacity to heal, and to hope, and to emerge from the most painful moments and a bitter, bitter version of ourselves, but to make a better version of ourselves.<br><br>You know, today, we consecrate Juneteenth for what it ought to be, what it must be: a national holiday. As the Vice President noted, a holiday that will join the others of our national celebrations: our independence, our laborers who built this nation, our servicemen and women who served and died in its defense. And the first new national holiday since the creation of Martin Luther King Holiday nearly four decades ago.<br><br>I am grateful to the members of Congress here today &#8212; in particular, the Congressional Black Caucus, who did so much to make this day possible.<br><br>I’m especially pleased that we showed the nation that we can come together as Democrats and Republicans to commemorate this day with the overwhelming bipartisan support of the Congress. I hope this is the beginning of a change in the way we deal with one another.<br><br>And we’re blessed &#8212; we’re blessed to mark the day in the presence of Ms. Opal Lee. As my mother would say, “God love her.” (Applause.)<br><br>I had the honor of meeting her in Nevada more than a year ago. She told me she loved me, and I believed it. (Laughter.) I wanted to believe it. (Laughs.) Ms. Opal, you’re incredible. A daughter of Texas. Grandmother of the movement to make Juneteenth a federal holiday.<br><br>And Ms. Opal is &#8212; you won’t believe it &#8212; she’s 49 years old. (Laughter.) Or 94 years old, but I &#8212; (laughter). You are an incredible woman, Ms. Opal. You really are.<br><br>As a child growing up in Texas, she and her family would celebrate Juneteenth. On Juneteenth, 1939, when she was 12 years old, the white &#8212; a white mob torched her family home. But such hate never stopped her any more than it stopped the vast majority of you I’m looking at from this podium.<br><br>Over the course of decades, she’s made it her mission to see that this day came. It was almost a singular mission. She’s walked for miles and miles, literally and figuratively, to bring attention to Juneteenth, to make this day possible.<br><br>I ask, once again, we all stand and give her a warm welcome to the White House. (Applause.)<br><br>As they still say in the Senate and I said for 36 years, &#8220;if you excuse me there for a point of personal privilege,&#8221; as I was walking down, I regret that my grandchildren aren’t here because this is a really, really, really important moment in our history.<br><br>By making Juneteenth a federal holiday, all Americans can feel the power of this day, and learn from our history, and celebrate progress, and grapple with the distance we’ve come but the distance we have to travel, Jim.<br><br>You know, I said a few weeks ago, marking the 100th anniversary of the Tulsa Race Massacre, great nations don’t ignore their most painful moments. Great nations don’t ignore their most painful moments. They don’t ignore those moments of the past. They embrace them. Great nations don’t walk away. We come to terms with the mistakes we made. And in remembering those moments, we begin to heal and grow stronger.<br><br>The truth is, it’s not &#8212; simply not enough just to commemorate Juneteenth. After all, the emancipation of enslaved Black Americans didn’t mark the end of America’s work to deliver on the promise of equality; it only marked the beginning.<br><br>To honor the true meaning of Juneteenth, we have to continue toward that promise because we’ve not gotten there yet. The Vice President and I and our entire administration and all of you in this room are committed to doing just that.<br><br>That’s why we’ve launched an aggressive effort to combat racial discrimination in housing &#8212; finally address the cruel fact that a home owned, to this day, by a Black American family is usually appraised at a lower rate for a similar home owned by a white family in a similar area.<br><br>That’s why we committed to increasing Black homeownership, one of the biggest drivers of generational wealth.<br><br>That’s why we&#8217;re making it possible for more Black entrepreneurs to access &#8212; to access capital, because their ideas are as good; they lack the capital to get their fair &#8212; and get their fair share of federal contracts so they can begin to build wealth.<br><br>That’s why we’re working to give each and every child, three and four years of age, not daycare, but school &#8212; in a school. (Applause.)<br><br>That’s why &#8212; that&#8217;s why we’re unlocking the incredibly creative and innovation &#8212; innovation of the history &#8212; of our Historical Black Colleges and Universities, providing them with the resources to invest in research centers and laboratories to help HBCU graduates prepare and compete for good-paying jobs in the industries of the future.<br><br>Folks, the promise of equality is not going to be fulfilled until we become real &#8212; it becomes real in our schools and on our Main Streets and in our neighborhoods &#8212; our healthcare system and ensuring that equity is at the heart of our fight against the pandemic; in the water that comes out of our faucets and the air that we breathe in our communities; in our justice system &#8212; so that we can fulfill the promise of America for all people. All of our people.<br><br>And it’s not going to be fulfilled so long as the sacred right to vote remains under attack. (Applause.)<br><br>We see this assault from restrictive laws, threats of intimidation, voter purges, and more &#8212; an assault that offends the very democracy &#8212; our very democracy.<br><br>We can’t rest until the promise of equality is fulfilled for every one of us in every corner of this nation. That, to me, is the meaning of Juneteenth. That’s what it’s about.<br><br>So let’s make this June- &#8212; this very Juneteenth, tomorrow &#8212; the first that our nation will celebrate all together, as one nation &#8212; a Juneteenth of action on many fronts.&nbsp;<br><br>One of those is vaccinations. Tomorrow, the Vice President will be in Atlanta on a bus tour, helping to spread the word, like all of you have been doing, on lifesaving vaccines.<br><br>And across the country this weekend, including here in Washington, people will be canvassing and hosting events in their communities, going door-to-door, encouraging vaccinations.<br><br>We’ve built equity into the heart of the vaccination program from day one, but we still have more work to do to close the racial gap in vaccination rates. The more we can do that, the more we can save lives.</p>



<p>Today also marks the sixth anniversary of the tragic deaths of &#8212; at Mother Emanuel Church in Charleston, South Carolina. A killer motivated by hate, intending to start a race war in South Carolina. He joined his victims in a Bible study class, then he took their lives in the house of worship.<br><br>It’s a reminder that our work to root out hate never ends &#8212; because hate only hides, it never fully goes away. It hides. And when you breathe oxygen under that rock, it comes out.<br><br>And that’s why we must understand that Juneteenth represents not only the commemoration of the end of slavery in America more than 150 years ago, but the ongoing work to have to bring true equity and racial justice into American society, which we can do.<br><br>In short, this day doesn’t just celebrate the past; it calls for action today.<br><br>I wish all Americans a happy Juneteenth. I am shortly going to &#8212; in a moment, going to sign into law, making it a federal holiday.<br><br>And I have to say to you, I’ve only been President for several months, but I think this will go down, for me, as one of the greatest honors I will have had as President, not because I did it; you did it &#8212; Democrats and Republicans. But it’s an enormous, enormous honor.<br><br>Thank you for what you’ve done. And, by the way, typical of most of us in Congress and the Senate, I went down to the other end of the hall first and thanked your staffs because I know who does the hard work. (Laughter and applause.) They’re down there. They’re at the other end, but I thanked them as well.<br><br>May God bless you all. And may God protect our troops. Thank you. (Applause.)<br><br>Now, I’d like to invite up, while I sign, Senator Tina Smith, Senator Ed Markey, Senator Raphael Warnock, Senator John Cornyn, Whip <s>John</s> [Jim] Clyburn, Representative Barbara Lee, Representative Danny Davis, Chair Joyce Beatty, and Sheila Jackson Lee, and Ms. Opal.<br><br>(The act is signed.) (Applause.)<br><br>4:06 P.M. EDT</p>
