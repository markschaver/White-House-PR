<p class="has-text-align-center">Aboard Air Force One<br>En Route Des Moines, Iowa</p>



<p>1:24 P.M. EDT</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Okay, welcome to our trip to Iowa.&nbsp; Two items for you at the top.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One, you may have seen this, but we put out a readout of the President’s call with Prime Minister Boris Johnson of the United Kingdom and about his recent visit &#8212; the Prime Minister’s recent visit to Ukraine.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the readout, just to highlight a few points: “The leaders affirmed their commitment to continue providing security and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine in the face of ongoing atrocities by Russia.&nbsp; They also welcomed ongoing cooperation with allies and partners to impose severe costs on Russia for its unprovoked and unjustified war.”</p>



<p>Also wanted to highlight part of the reason &#8212; a big part of the reason we’re going to Iowa today: Today, the President is announcing &#8212; sorry, dramatic windup &#8212; new steps to achieve the goal of reducing &#8212; of building real energy independence in the long term by reducing our reliance on fossil fuels, by increasing fuel supplies, offering more consumer choices, and reducing gasoline prices for Americans.&nbsp; And, of course, doing that on a day where we&#8217;ve seen that energy prices is about 70 percent of the headline CPA &#8212; CPI data.&nbsp; So, we know we need to do everything possible to reduce costs for the American people.</p>



<p>He&#8217;s going to announce that the EPA Administrator is planning to allow E15 gasoline &#8212; gasoline that uses a 15 percent ethanol blend &#8212; to be sold this summer.&nbsp; This is the latest step in expanding Americans’ access to affordable fuel supply and bringing relief to Americans suffering from Putin’s price hike at the pump.</p>



<p>To make E15 available in the summer, the EPA is planning to issue a national emergency waiver.&nbsp; Without this action, E15 cannot be used in most of the country from June 1st to September 15th, and the EPA plans to take final action to issue the emergency waiver closer to June 1st.&nbsp;</p>



<p>E15 is currently offered at 2,300 gas stations in the country, many of them in the Midwest, where it can serve as an important and more affordable source of fuel.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At current prices, E15 can save a family 10 cents per gallon of gas on average, and many stores sell E15 at an even greater discount.</p>



<p>With that, (inaudible).</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, is the United States participating in an investigation into whether chemical weapons were used in Mariupol?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We’ve nothing to confirm at this time.&nbsp; Of course, we are going to contribute in every way we can to getting to the bottom of it, but we don&#8217;t have anyone on the ground as a part of that at this point in time, as you well know.&nbsp; So I don&#8217;t have any updates.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did you see the comments from President Putin out in eastern Russia in which he seemed to be very defensive and said the military operation will continue?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; That &#8212; I have not seen those comments, but that is certainly in lined &#8212; in line with our expectations and what we&#8217;ve seen over the course of the last several days, which is a repositioning, not a total withdrawal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>And while we can certainly applaud the Ukrainians for their bravery and courage in essentially winning the Battle of Kyiv, we know that the brutality and the intention of taking over, militarily, portions of Ukraine, parts of the country &#8212; a sovereign country &#8212; we expect that to continue.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, you just mentioned that 70 percent of the CPI increase was gasoline related.&nbsp; We saw prices go up for housing, men’s clothing, airfare &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Food.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; food &#8212; you know, transportation, and all sorts of things.&nbsp; I&#8217;m just wondering if &#8212; what in this report has the White House convinced that inflation isn&#8217;t being embedded into the economy going forward?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would say that the projections con- &#8211;from the Federal Reserve and other outside economists continue to be that inflation will moderate by year end.&nbsp; But we are not going to wait for that.&nbsp; And that is one of the reasons that the President is going to continue to take steps.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One step he’s taking, of course, today, which is to lower the cost of gasoline by &#8212; by announcing the EPA waivers that E15 can be available at 2,300 gas stations across the country.</p>



<p>But beyond that, he’s obviously taken steps to release a historic amount from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.&nbsp; And we’ve continued to advocate for actions Congress can take to lower costs for Americans.</p>



<p>And if you look at how all of those costs impact Americans, we know that big, big costs &#8212; our childcare, healthcare, eldercare &#8212; these are all areas where the President has proposed a plan to reduce costs, and certainly it’s reminder of the importance of moving forward with that.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, on the fuel waivers, the EPA’s own guidance says specifically that these waivers aren’t supposed to be used for relieving high gas prices.&nbsp; Some critics are also pointing to the fact that you’re declaring an emergency in June; we’re sitting in April right now.&nbsp; Can you kind of talk through why we’re taking some unprecedented steps or using some unprecedented justifications for this waiver?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, we’ve seen gas prices go up anywhere from 80 cents to a dollar since the &#8212; since President Putin invaded Ukraine.&nbsp; And that is certainly having a significant impact on the pocketbooks of Americans across the country.</p>



<p>And so, there are a range of reasons to take this step &#8212; and, of course, that the EPA is taking this step.&nbsp; But certainly, the fact that, right now, without this step, 2,3000 gas stations would essentially have a cover over the E15 gas pumps, not allowing people to utilize gas that is less expensive and not allowing additional supply to get into the marketplace.</p>



<p>So, at this moment where, obviously, we have a foreign dictator invading another country, we want to give ourselves additional flexibility and also do whatever we can do reduce costs for the American people.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And you mentioned the Federal Reserve.&nbsp; There’s been some reporting that Michael Barr is a leading candidate for the nomination that Sarah Bloom Raskin had before.&nbsp; Can you confirm whether or not that’s true in terms of if he’s being considered, and also, kind of, give a sense of timeline for when you guys expect to make that announcement?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don’t have anything to confirm and no guidance to offer other than to reiterate that the President has every intention of nominating an eminently qualified person to fill this important role in the Federal Reserve.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the last one on Ukraine.&nbsp; There seems to be a new offensive mounting &#8212; that Russia is mounting towards eastern Ukraine.&nbsp; Specifically, I’m wondering if you have a sense of &#8212; well, what you expect to happen there and what you’re worried about, what you’re looking at in terms of that situation.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; So on the ground &#8212; and I know my colleagues at the Department of Defense did a backgrounder today as well &#8212; but all indications are that Russia will seek to surround and overwhelm Ukrainian forces in that region.&nbsp; We expect Russia will continue to launch air and missile strikes across the rest of the country to cause military and economic damage and to cause terror, because Russia’s goal in the end is to weaken Ukraine as much as possible.</p>



<p>We also expect that this stage of the conflict could last a long time.&nbsp; And we should have no illusions that Russia will adjust its brutal tactics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, of course, what our focus is on is continuing to provide a range of security assistance.&nbsp; We essentially look at and review the requests made by Ukrainian leaders.&nbsp; And last week, they had a call with our Chairman of the Joint Chiefs and our National Security Advisor &#8212; a two-hour call &#8212; where they went through items on that list.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I think this was already &#8212; this was also provided by the Defense Department, but let me reiterate: We’re also &#8212; as we’re looking to continue to expedite delivery &#8212; we’ve committed $1.7 billion, as you all know &#8212; we’re working to provide the Ukrainians with artillery systems that they have recently requested in conversations between our governments.&nbsp; And we’re working to provide them with artillery from U.S. stocks but also to facilitate the transfer from other allies and partners as well, as we did with the S-300 and the backfill of the Patriot battery system.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jake had said over the weekend that some of those additional &#8212; some of that additional military aid might need trainings from Western &#8212; do you have any sense of how that’s going to work, where that training would happen, and who would be involved?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; That is what we&#8217;re discussing and still working through.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, I want to ask about the subway shooting &#8212; the subway attack in New York.&nbsp; What more can you tell us about what the White House&#8217;s contact has been with New York City and New York state officials?&nbsp; Has the President spoken to the mayor or the governor?&nbsp; What kind of assistance has the White House offered?&nbsp; What has New York City asked for?&nbsp; And do you know why the NYPD has already said that, at this time, this isn&#8217;t being investigated as terror?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, the investigation is going to happen and be overseen by local New York authorities.&nbsp;&nbsp; The New York Police Department Counterterrorism Unit is working with the JTF- &#8212; TF [JTTF], the FBI, and the ATF to investigate.&nbsp; So, certainly, we would assist in every appropriate way through those channels.</p>



<p>As we noted earlier this morning, not only has the President been briefed on latest developments, but White House senior staff are in touch with Mayor Adams, with poli- &#8212; with the police commissioner, and we&#8217;ve offered any assistance we can provide.</p>



<p>I just spoke again with the President about this earlier on the plane, and he reiterated that that is his &#8212; his request of his team.&nbsp; Anything they need, anything they want, we are here to help them and provide that to them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He has not yet had a call.&nbsp; If that happens today, I will provide that information to all of you.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you know why they’ve said that this is not, at this time, being investigated as terror; if this investigation is so preliminary, why they’ve ruled that out?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I would point you to them.&nbsp; They&#8217;re overseeing the investigation.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you think we might hear from the President specifically on this &#8212; on this matter today?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don’t have a prediction of that at this point in time, but if there are updates to provide from our end, I&#8217;ll let you all know.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I ask a follow-up on the use of possible chemical weapons or poisonous gas in Russia?&nbsp; What would our response be if that is verified?&nbsp; How &#8212; and how long might it take to verify that?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I&#8217;m not going to speculate about hypotheticals.&nbsp; We don&#8217;t have confirmation of the use, and so I&#8217;m not going to speculate on hypotheticals at this point.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I will note that it is difficult to get the data and information that you need in cases like this.&nbsp; We don&#8217;t have &#8212; we don&#8217;t have a team on the ground, obviously.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I would note that we did have credical [sic] &#8212; credible information before today that Russia may use a variety of riot control agents, including tear gas mixed with chemical agents, that would cause stronger symptoms in order to weaken and incapacitate entrenched Ukrainian fighters and civilians as part of its aggressive campaign to take Mariupol.</p>



<p>We shared that information with the Ukrainians at the time.&nbsp; And of course, we’ll continue to share up-to-date intelligence-gathering information.</p>



<p>But at this point in time, we have no confirmation, so I’m not going to get ahead of that process.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And one more about China.&nbsp; I understand there&#8217;s advice to &#8212; going out to Americans &#8212; a recommendation not to travel to China right now because of zero-COVID policies and the possibility of parents being separated from their children, which we know is happening, obviously, now in China.&nbsp; Do we have any evidence or any talk of that happening to American citizens right now who are in China?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I would point you to the State Department.&nbsp; They provide that type of guidance and information to the American people, wherever they are in the world.&nbsp; They do it out of an abundance of caution and to make sure they&#8217;re as transparent as possible about what they&#8217;re seeing on the ground in countries.</p>



<p>And I believe it was specific to Shanghai, not all of China &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, on &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; &#8212; I believe.</p>



<p><a>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Back on CPI: I think you said yesterday you don&#8217;t expect most people to dive beyond headline inflation.&nbsp; So how concerned is the White House that people are going to see that 8.5 percent sort of roll back their spending and then drive us into a recession?&nbsp;</a></p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would also say that core CPI did go down this month.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t want to over-crank that, but that is certainly also data we look at.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And we noted that &#8212; our expectation about headline CPI &#8211;so that the American people, through all of you and whatever way you chose to report it, would understand we expected it to be elevated because of Putin’s invasion; because of the impact on energy prices, which they&#8217;re certainly experiencing every day.</p>



<p>So, I don&#8217;t have a projection on consumer spending at this point in time.&nbsp; Obviously, that data is taken by economists, but we wanted to provide as much information as we could assess about what we thought the data would show based on what people are already experiencing when they go to the gas pumps.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, back on the shooting, I’m wondering if you guys have an assessment of how successful these DOJ strike forces have been.&nbsp; Specifically, do we have a number of how many illegally transferred guns they’ve taken off the streets in those five major metro areas?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; It’s a great question.&nbsp; I can see if we can get an update from the Department of Justice, who obviously oversees the strike forces, in terms of what their successes have been.&nbsp; I know we’ve provided updates a little bit in the past, but I don’t have that information in front of me, so let me get that to you after the bri- &#8212; after (inaudible).</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Ukraine, please.&nbsp; The administration has said many times that it would help Ukraine investigate war crimes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you maybe detail how is that happening without having presence on the ground?&nbsp; And is it maybe a plan at some stage to send U.S. personnel to collect &#8212; for example, to collect evidence and to assist Ukrainian forces?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; Well, I don&#8217;t have any updates on that last particular part of your question.&nbsp; What I can tell you is that there are a couple of ways that historically we have participated in investigations, and we certainly would in this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some of that is intel gathering and sharing that with our partners and allies around the world who are also contributing to investigations.&nbsp; Some of that is through those diplomatic channels, of course.&nbsp; Some of that is reporting of, frankly, the media and reporters who are in Ukraine, on the ground, who can sometimes not gather the type of data necessarily I’m talking about, but often do provide pictures and visuals.&nbsp; And then there is, of course, a range of means we have to work to gather information.&nbsp; But I can’t detail more of it from here.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And a last one, on the French election.&nbsp; I know you won’t comment on the outcome, but is the administration monitoring the process for Russian interference?&nbsp; And have you seen signs of it?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don’t have an assessment of it, but I think we&#8217;ve seen the Russians’ interference in elections throughout the course of recent history and before then, whether it&#8217;s here or in Europe.&nbsp; So, certainly, we anticipate that that could be possible.&nbsp; But I don&#8217;t have any confirmation of it at this point in time.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the President&#8217;s position on whether Iowa should have the first-in-the-nation presidential contest in ’24?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; There is a process being overseen by the DNC that will play out over the course of the coming days.&nbsp; And we certainly respect and support that process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the French election, is there a concern within the White House that if President Macron is not reelected, that it could, sort of, become an issue in the &#8212; in the bid to keep European, sort of, unity and cross-Atlantic unity in the face of the Russian invasion of Ukraine?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, unity is obviously very important to us.&nbsp; Maybe the most used word in our description of our efforts and our strategy here.&nbsp; But, as you know, the runoff election is not for a week and a half, so we&#8217;re just not going to get ahead of that.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On COVID, Jen, Philadelphia is the first major city to reinstate an indoor mask mandate with this current surge.&nbsp; Do you guys expect other cities to follow suit?&nbsp; What would it take for the White House to reinstate a mask mandate on campus as well?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; It would take the CDC recommending that.&nbsp; I would remind you that what &#8212; every state and city is going to make evaluations and their own assessments on what they need to do to keep communities safe.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What we are guided by is the CDC guidance, which has red, green, yellow, and even impact &#8212; yellow-green, I should say.&nbsp; It even impacts where the President wears masks, where we wear masks.&nbsp; And obviously, if we go to an area where it’s recommended, we will continue to do that.</p>



<p>So, you know, right now, there are of course requirements in transit, but the President won&#8217;t be wearing a mask &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is Philadelphia taking this step prematurely, in the White House’s view?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; It’s been our view that cities and local communities can take and should take steps that they feel will keep their community safe.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I ask you one more about ethanol?&nbsp; This is a &#8212; it wasn&#8217;t an emergency suspension, but this is something the Trump administration did.&nbsp; They allowed year-round sales of E15.&nbsp; It was overturned by federal court.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, I&#8217;m just wondering &#8212; you know, the politics of this, this is something that was also supported by several Midwestern Republican senators in the Senate.&nbsp; So is there any fear that the Democratic base might be a little bit disillusioned by doing something that has been supported by Republicans and was done by the Trump administration, even given the circumstances with rising gas prices?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I think our view is that people &#8212; the American people are going to put gas in their tanks, in their cars across the country, including across the Midwest where many of these 2,300 pumps are, where &#8212; that have E15 &#8212; the E15 gasoline option.&nbsp; And if they can pay 10 cents less a gallon, then they’ll appreciate that.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not sure they&#8217;re looking at that through a political lens.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One more on inflation, Jen.&nbsp; Given the consistently high numbers we keep seeing and Shanghai being in lockdown, zero-COVID, Russia’s war &#8212; I know you&#8217;re saying that the Fed is anticipating, end of year, things will ease, but how certain can we really be, given the uncertainties and these lo- &#8212; you know, COVID-zero and Russia’s war?&nbsp; It could last longer, right?&nbsp;</p>



<p>And would the Pres- &#8212; and would the President &#8212; obviously, the Fed is a sep- &#8212; is separate, but would he then want to not see an increase in interest rates, an increase in what the Fed is already planning for the rest of the year?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, the Fed, as you noted, is independent.&nbsp; And they have predicted or conveyed publicly that they intend to recalibrate.&nbsp; We support that pivot, and we support their independence and their, you know, ability to make decisions about interest rates and other policies around inflation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What I will say though is that how the American people experience inflation is rising costs &#8212; right? &#8212; in a variety of areas.&nbsp; Right?&nbsp; They experience it at the gas pump.&nbsp; They experience it when they go to the grocery store.&nbsp; They experience it when things cost more, whether it’s childcare or taking care of their grandparents.&nbsp; That’s why we have been so aggressive in pushing for the President’s agenda that would lower those costs &#8212; because they would have such a huge impact on the American people, and we feel that’s a solution.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If Republicans have an alternative to it, we welcome that.&nbsp; But that is a way we could cut costs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But otherwise, to go back to your original question, we certainly respect the independence of the Federal Reserve and support their publicly stated intention of recalibrating.</p>

<p>Today, the country’s most restrictive legislation regulating access to reproductive health care was signed into law in Oklahoma. This law makes providing an abortion illegal in the state of Oklahoma, with only a narrow exception for medical emergencies and no exception for rape or incest.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This unconstitutional attack on women’s rights is just the latest and one of the most extreme state laws signed into law to date. Protecting the right recognized in&nbsp;<em>Roe v. Wade</em>&nbsp;continues to be a priority for the Biden-Harris Administration, and we call on Congress to pass the Women’s Health Protection Act, which would shut down these attacks and codify this long-recognized, constitutional right. Make no mistake: the actions today in Oklahoma are a part of disturbing national trend attacking women’s rights and the Biden Administration will continue to stand with women in Oklahoma and across the country in the fight to defend their freedom to make their own choices about their futures.</p>

<p>The President is committed to doing everything he can to address the pain Americans are feeling at the pump as a result of Putin’s Price Hike. The Administration’s strategy to spur the development of homegrown biofuels is critical to expanding Americans’ options for affordable fuel in the short-term and to building real energy independence in the long-term by reducing our reliance on fossil fuels. Today, the President is announcing new steps to achieve that goal by increasing fuel supplies, offering more consumer choices, and reducing gasoline prices for Americans.</p>



<p><em>Expanding Americans’ Access to Affordable Fuel Options This Summer</em></p>



<p>The President will announce today that the EPA Administrator is planning to allow E15 gasoline—gasoline that uses a 15 percent ethanol blend—to be sold this summer. This is the latest step in expanding Americans’ access to affordable fuel supply and bringing relief to Americans suffering from Putin’s Price Hike at the pump.</p>



<ul><li>To make E15 available in the summer, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is planning to issue a national, emergency waiver. Without this action, E15 cannot be used in most of the country from June 1<sup>st </sup>to September 15<sup>th</sup>, and the EPA plans to take final action to issue the emergency waiver closer to June 1<sup>st</sup>. E15 is currently offered at 2,300 gas stations in the country, where it can serve as an important—and more affordable—source of fuel.</li></ul>



<ul><li>An emergency waiver can help increase fuel supplies, give consumers more choice to get lower prices, and provide savings to many families. At current prices, E15 can save a family 10 cents per gallon of gas on average, and many stores sell E15 at an even greater discount. For working families—families eager to travel and visit their loved ones—that will add up to real savings. Allowing higher levels of blending will also reduce our dependency on foreign fuels as we rely more heavily on home-grown biofuels. This will help us bridge towards real energy independence.</li></ul>



<ul><li>In implementing this emergency fuel waiver, EPA will work with states across the country to ensure there are no significant air quality impacts through the summer driving season.</li></ul>



<ul><li>EPA is also considering additional action to facilitate the use of E15 year-round, including continued discussions with states who have expressed interest in allowing year-round use of E15 and considering modifications to E15 fuel pump labeling.</li></ul>



<p>The announcements today build on the steps the President has taken in recent weeks to address the Putin Price Hike and bring relief to Americans at the gas pump.</p>



<ul><li>President Biden worked with allies and partners through the International Energy Agency to authorize a historic release from petroleum reserves around the world, putting 240 million barrels of oil on the market in the next six months—more than one million barrels per day.</li></ul>



<ul><li>The President called for a “use it or lose it” policy to make oil companies pay fees on wells from their leases that they haven’t used in years and on acres of public lands that they are holding without producing.</li></ul>



<ul><li>The President put forward concrete steps to promote real independence from fossil fuels by accelerating the transition to clean energy, ranging from incentives for electric vehicles to Defense Production Act authority for large capacity batteries to a new partnership to reduce European reliance on natural gas.</li></ul>



<p><em>Enabling Energy Independence by Boosting Homegrown Biofuels</em></p>



<p>The President believes that the actions of a dictator half a world away should not impact what families pay at the pump here at home. Today’s actions also reinforce the Biden-Harris Administration’s goal of achieving real energy independence and commitment to a long-term strategy to spur smart development and adoption of sustainable, homegrown fuels.</p>



<p>The Administration has announced the following key steps:</p>



<ul><li><strong>$700 Million for Biofuels Producers</strong>: As part of the Pandemic Assistance for Producers initiative, USDA will provide up to $700 million in funding through a new Biofuel Producer Program. The Program will support agricultural producers that rely on biofuels producers as a market for their agricultural products. By making payments to producers of biofuels, the funding will help maintain a viable and significant market for such agricultural products. Producers can expect awards before the end of April.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>$5.6 million for Infrastructure for Renewable Fuels through the Higher Blends Infrastructure Incentive Program: </strong>To expand the infrastructure for renewable fuels derived from U.S. agricultural products, USDA is announcing $5.6 million in grants through <a href="https://www.rd.usda.gov/hbiip">the Higher Blends Infrastructure Incentive Program</a>. The purpose of the program is to significantly increase the sales and use of higher blends of ethanol and biodiesel. The awards being announced today will support 9 projects in 7 states.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>$100 Million for Biofuels Infrastructure</strong>: Investing in biofuels infrastructure ensures that market opportunities are available for sustainable fuel sources—and that those sustainable fuels can reach consumers. That is why USDA announced $100 million in new funding for grants for biofuels infrastructure. The funding will provide grants to refueling and distribution facilities for the cost of installation, retrofitting or otherwise upgrading of infrastructure required at a location to ensure the environmentally safe availability of fuel containing ethanol blends of E15 and greater or fuel containing biodiesel blends B-20 and greater. USDA will also make funding available to support biofuels for railways as a means of assisting with supply chains and helping to reduce costs for consumer goods and transportation.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Spurring a New Market in Sustainable Aviation Fuels</strong>: The Administration announced new actions to support sustainable aviation with a focus on low-carbon fuels that will create economic opportunity for agricultural communities. This included:<ul><li>A new Sustainable Aviation Fuel Grand Challenge to inspire the dramatic increase in the production of sustainable aviation fuels to at least 3 billion gallons per year by 2030;</li></ul><ul><li>New and ongoing funding opportunities to support sustainable aviation fuel projects and fuel producers totaling up to $4.3 billion; and</li></ul><ul><li>An increase in R&amp;D activities to demonstrate new technologies that can achieve at least a 30% improvement in aircraft fuel efficiency.</li></ul></li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Expanding Use of Canola Oil: </strong>Today, EPA is also announcing efforts to expand supply and choices for other forms of fuel, such as diesel and jet fuel. The Agency is proposing a new approval for canola oil that will add new pathways for fuels to participate in the Renewable Fuel Standard program to provide renewable diesel, jet fuel and other fuels. This action demonstrates EPA’s commitment to approving new petitions for renewable fuels that can provide greenhouse gas benefits as well as reduce reliance on petroleum fuels.</li></ul>



<p>These actions are critical to building real energy independence and protecting Americans from volatile prices by reducing our reliance on fossil fuels. Together, they will create good-paying jobs, support American agriculture and manufacturing, and accelerate the transition to clean energy.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Rose Garden</p>



<p>2:42 P.M. EDT<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Wow.&nbsp; Thank you, Madam Vice President, Deputy Attorney General Monaco.<br><br>And, Mia, you’re an incredible young woman.&nbsp; We spoke for a moment inside the Oval Office.&nbsp; And a lot of people here who have lost someone &#8212; and too many here have lost someone &#8212; know that no matter what the occasion, how celebratory or not it is, when you have to repeat it, you relive it like it just happened a moment ago.&nbsp; Your poise, your confidence, and your intellect are really impressive, honey.&nbsp; I mean, they really are.&nbsp; And, you know, I think most people here can tell you’ve gone through serious loss; that the best way to deal with it is to find purpose, and you found real purpose.&nbsp; And you are impressive.&nbsp;<br><br>And thank you for sharing your strength, for helping us remember your friend Dominic Blackwell and Gracie Muehlberger.&nbsp; You know, Dominic and Gracie’s parents are with us today.&nbsp;<br><br>Are you prepared to stand up if &#8212; I don’t want to embarrass you, but would you stand up?&nbsp; (Applause.) &nbsp;If you have a moment afterwards, maybe you can come into the Oval with me.&nbsp; If you wouldn’t mind, I’d like to talk to you.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Frank and Nancy, Bryan and Cindy, everyone here, as they say, feels your pain a little bit, particularly if they’ve suffered a serious loss.&nbsp; You’ve now joined a terrible fellowship of loss that many people have experienced.&nbsp;<br><br>There are too many survivors and advocates here for me to name everyone today, but let me say: The loss in this crowd is incalculable, but so is the strength &#8212; so is the strength.&nbsp; I believe our nation will be safer for your bravery, and I really mean that.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Survivors like Mia&nbsp;and Manny, and Claudia &#8212; a Los Angeles Deputy Sheriff who survived an ambush by a shooter with a ghost gun &#8212;&nbsp;represent individuals and families all across this country whose lives have been forever changed by a ghost gun.&nbsp; Some made national headlines; many others did not.<br><br>Today, we honor your strength and your action.<br><br>A year ago this week, standing here with many of you, I instructed the Attorney General to write a regulation that would<br>would rein in the proliferation of ghost guns because I was having trouble getting anything passed in the Congress, but I used what we call “regulatory authority.”<br><br>A year later, we’re here.&nbsp; We keep that promise.<br><br>The gun lobby tried to tie up the regulators in paperwork for a long, long time.&nbsp; The NRA called this rule I’m about to announce, “extreme.” &nbsp;“Extreme.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>But let me ask you: Is it extreme to protect police officers?&nbsp; Extreme to protect our children?&nbsp; Extreme to keep guns out of the hands of people who couldn’t even pass a background check?<br><br>AUDIENCE:&nbsp; Nooo &#8212;<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Look, the idea that someone on a terrorist list could purchase one of these guns is extreme?&nbsp; It isn’t extreme; it’s just basic common sense.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>You know, if you buy a couch you have to assemble, it’s still a couch.&nbsp; If you order a package, like this one over here, that includes the parts you need, the directions for assembling a functioning firearm, you bought a gun.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Take a look.&nbsp; Take a look at this.&nbsp; It comes in this package.&nbsp; You can see the picture down here maybe.&nbsp; This is the gun.&nbsp;<br><br>(Holds up upper and lower receivers of a handgun.)<br><br>It’s not hard to put together. &nbsp;A little drill &#8212; hand drill at home.&nbsp; It doesn’t take very long.&nbsp; Anyone can order it in the mail. &nbsp;Anyone.&nbsp;<br><br>And, folks, a felon, a terrorist, a domestic abuser can go from a gun kit to a gun in as little as 30 minutes.<br><br>Buyers aren’t required to pass background checks.&nbsp; Because guns have no serial numbers &#8212; these guns &#8212; when they show up at a crime scene, they can’t be traced.&nbsp; Harder to find and prove who used them.&nbsp; Meaning you can’t connect the gun to the shooter and hold them accountable.<br><br>In fact, the ATF reports that they’ve been able to trace less than 1 percent &#8212; less than 1 percent of ghost guns reported by law enforcement.&nbsp; And so it makes sense that police across the country are increasingly finding ghost guns at crime scenes.<br><br>And, by the way, ghost guns can be, quote, “rifles” &#8212; essentially assault weapons as well.&nbsp; This is one version of the kit you can buy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Last year alone, law enforcement reported approximately 20,000 suspected ghost guns to be &#8212; to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.&nbsp; That’s a tenfold increase in these ghost guns from 2016.&nbsp; Tenfold in five years.<br><br>These guns are weapons of choice for many criminals.&nbsp; We’re going to do everything we can to deprive them of that choice and, when we find them, put them in jail for a long, long time.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Law enforcement is sounding the alarms.&nbsp; Our communities are paying the price.&nbsp; And we’re acting.<br><br>Today, the United States Department of Justice is making it is illegal for a business to manufacture one of these kits without a serial number.&nbsp; Illegal.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Illegal for a licensed dealer to sell them without a background check.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>And starting today, weapons like the one used at Saugus<br>High School and to ambush deputies with us to- &#8212; that are here with us today are being treated like the deadly firearms they are.<br><br>And if somebody sells a ghost gun to a federally licensed dealer &#8212; for example, a pawn shop &#8212; that dealer must make the firearm and mark it with a serial number before reselling it.<br><br>All of a sudden, it’s no longer a ghost; it has a return address. &nbsp;And it’s going to help save lives, reduce crime, and get more criminals off the streets.&nbsp;<br><br>And this rule is only part of our strategy to go after ghost guns.&nbsp;<br><br>In February, the Department of Justice launched a nation &#8212; a National Gun &#8212; Ghost Guns Enforcement Initiative, intensifying our efforts to bring cases against those who use ghost guns illegally.&nbsp;<br><br>We’re teaching investigators and prosecutors best practices &#8212; how to build these cases &#8212; and assigning a coordinator in each of the ATF field divisions to serve as the point person for helping federal, state, and local law enforcement go after ghost guns.<br><br>If you commit a crime with a ghost gun, expect federal prosecution, not just state. &nbsp;Expect federal prosecution.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>This rule is an important step.&nbsp; It’s going to make a difference, I promise you.&nbsp; And there are a lot of other things we know work to reduce gun violence and other violent crimes and save lives.<br><br>That’s why I’ve put together a comprehensive strategy&nbsp;to supercharge what works while continuing to push Congress to act on sensible legislation to prevent gun violence.<br><br>In addition to today &#8212; in addition to today’s rule, we’re working on four areas:<br><br>First, we’re going after rogue gun dealers.&nbsp; The last time we had data on this was more than 20 years ago. &nbsp;Five percent of gun dealers sold 90 percent of illegal guns&nbsp;found at crime scenes.&nbsp; Five percent sold 90 percent.</p>



<p>These merchants of death are breaking the law for profit and selling guns that are killing innocent people.<br><br>We&#8217;re cracking down on these gun dealers and the violent criminals they knowingly arm.</p>



<p>Second, we&#8217;re disrupting illegal gun trafficking.&nbsp; Attorney General Garland has directed all U.S. Attorneys to prioritize combatting gun trafficking that is moving guns across state lines and city boundaries.<br><br>The Justice Department is surging prosecutorial resources to help shut down these trafficking corridors, including the one known as the “Iron Pipeline” that funnels weapons &#8212; (applause) &#8212; from gun shops in states like Georgia to crime scenes up and down the East Coast.<br><br>Thirdly, we’re funding strategies we know reduce gun crime: community policing and community violence interruption.<br><br>Look, I’ve said it many times: The answer is not to defund the police.&nbsp; It’s to fund the police and give them the tools and training to support &#8212; they need to be the partners and the protectors of our communities in need.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>And I’ve already made clear that I want cities, states, counties, and Tribes to use some of the $350 billion we sent to them in the American Rescue Plan &#8212; that I wrote in the first month &#8212; to reduce gun violence, hire police officers for community policing, pay police overtime, purchase crime-fighting technologies.&nbsp; They were given the money.&nbsp; They can do it.&nbsp; Spend it.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>And now, on top of that, I’m calling for additional funding to put police on the streets for community policing.&nbsp; One thing we learned in the middle of the crime wave not long ago: When the cop knows by first name who owns the corner drug store, who lives in the apartment above 6B, who the people who are &#8212; the pastors of the churches, guess what?&nbsp; People talk to them.&nbsp; They trust them.<br><br>My son was the Attorney General in Delaware. &nbsp;He&#8217;d go around and make sure everybody, literally, in these high-crime-rate neighborhoods &#8212; he&#8217;d give them his personal cell phone number and instructed all of the cops to do the same thing.&nbsp; And they did.&nbsp; And the crime plummeted.&nbsp; Not a joke.&nbsp; Look at the record.&nbsp; Not just my son, but all across the nation.<br><br>And for the&nbsp;<s>AFT</s>&nbsp;[ATF] to hire agents they need to help the fight gun crime &#8212; more agents.</p>



<p>My budget funds body cameras and makes sure police work with our local communities and are accountable to the local communities.</p>



<p>We’re also investing in community violence intervention.&nbsp; These are areas, local programs that utilize trusted messengers &#8212; community members and leaders &#8212; to work directly with people who are the most likely to commit a gun crime or become victims of gun crime &#8212; get to them early.&nbsp; It works.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; It works.&nbsp; They intervene before it’s too late.<br><br>Fourth, we’re funding jobs and training for young people, summer programs, drug treatment, mental health, housing availability, criminal justice reform, and reentry support for people coming home after incarceration.</p>



<p>Right now, you get let out of prison after serving your time; you get a bus ticket and 25 bucks.&nbsp; You end up under the same bridge you left 2, 5, 10 years earlier.&nbsp; If you serve your time, you qualify for Pell Grants, you qualify for housing, you’re qualified for food, you qualify to get back into the community &#8212; give them a fighting chance.</p>



<p>These are all demonstrated ways to reduce crime.&nbsp; And I’m strongly urging cities, states, counties, and Tribes to use the Rescue Plan funding we’ve sent them to do more in each of these areas.&nbsp; And they need to do more and do it quickly, before the summer, when crime typically surges around America.</p>



<p>So we’re pushing in each of these areas, but none of this absolves Congress &#8212; with all due respect to my members of Congress here; they’re the wrong people I’d be talking to &#8212; for their responsibility to act.<br><br>We need Congress to pass universal background checks.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Universal background checks.&nbsp;<br><br>And I know it’s controversial, but I got it done once: Ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I was getting criticized when I first passed this law when I was a senator.&nbsp; And guess what?&nbsp; I was down in southern Delaware &#8212; they do a lot of hunting and fishing down there &#8212; and I was walking up one of the creek beds.&nbsp; And a guy standing said, “You want to take my gun?”&nbsp; I said, “I don’t want to take your gun.”&nbsp; He said, “Well, you’re telling me I can’t have more than X number of bullets in a &#8212; in a &#8212; in my gun.”&nbsp; And I said, “What &#8212; do you think the deer you’re hunting wear Kevlar vests?&nbsp; What the hell you need 20 bullets for?&nbsp; You must be a hell of a terrible shot.”&nbsp; (Laughter.)</p>



<p>No, I’m serious.&nbsp; Think about it.&nbsp; Think about the mass shootings.&nbsp; As many as a hundred rounds.&nbsp; It’s a weapon of war.&nbsp; It has nothing to do with recreation.</p>



<p>Outright banning the sale and possession of un-serialized guns.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Eliminate gun manufacturers’ immunity from liability.&nbsp; They’re the only outfit &#8212; (applause) &#8212; they’re the only outfit in the country that is immune.</p>



<p>Imagine had the tobacco industry been immune to prost- &#8212; to being sued.&nbsp; Come on.</p>



<p>In February, the families of nine of the Sandy Hook shooting victims achieved a settlement against the maker of guns that was used to kill their children.</p>



<p>The Sandy &#8212; Sandy Hook folks are here.&nbsp; Do you &#8212; will you be embarrassed if I ask you to stand up?&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; These folks right here did more to keep all of this going than anybody.&nbsp; We owe you, man.&nbsp; We owe you.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; It never goes away, does it?&nbsp; God love you.</p>



<p>Look, this is incredibly rare because gun manufacturers have more immunity from liability than any other American industry, so they have never had to take responsibility for the death and destruction their products cause.&nbsp; But as part of this settlement, Remington agreed to release thousands of pages of internal documents.</p>



<p>You did that.</p>



<p>And why &#8212; here’s why it’s so important: Remember, it wasn’t until we saw the internal documents that we really understood what cigarette manufacturers were doing to our kids and to our families.<br><br>Now we may begin to see what gun manufacturers are and are not doing when it comes to making and marketing their deadly products.<br><br>And, by the way &#8212; it’s going to sound bizarre &#8212; I support the Second Amendment.&nbsp; You have a right.&nbsp; But from the very beginning, the Second Amendment didn’t say you can own any gun you want, big as you want.&nbsp; You couldn’t buy a cannon when, in fact, the Second Amendment passed.&nbsp; And certain people from the very beginning weren’t allowed to purchase guns.&nbsp; It’s nothing new.&nbsp; It’s just rational.</p>



<p>Look, this should be just the start.&nbsp; We need to repeal the liability shield of gun manufacturers and finally hold them accountable for false advertising and many other things they do.<br><br>There’s one more action I’m taking today.<br><br>It’s only been &#8212; and there’s been only one Senate who has confirmed a director of Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives in the Bureau’s entire history.&nbsp; It used to be it didn’t require Senate action when I first got to the Senate.&nbsp; But it’s only been one since it became required confirmation.</p>



<p>This is an agency whose mission it is to protect communities from violent criminals, illegal trafficking of firearms, acts of arson and bombing, and a lot more.&nbsp; The mission of this agency isn’t controversial, it’s public safety.</p>



<p>Today, to lead and support the dedicated men and women of the&nbsp;<s>AFT</s>&nbsp;[ATF], I am proud to nominate Steve Del- &#8212; Dettelbach &#8212; excuse me, I mispronounced your name &#8212; I just &#8212; as Director of Bureau of Al- &#8212; Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.</p>



<p>Steve is immensely qualified.&nbsp; He served the Department of Justice for two decades.&nbsp; He worked side by side to support the work of federal, state, and local law enforcement, including<s>AFT</s>&nbsp;[ATF] agents.&nbsp; And one of those was he &#8212; a case he was &#8212; personally tried as a U.S. Attorney, where the serial arsonist firebombed the courthouses and police headquarters in Mansfield, Ohio.</p>



<p>For his work, Steve got death threats, but the defendant got 60 years.</p>



<p>Steve also partnered with the community leaders and law enforcement to help prevent violent crime.&nbsp; He’s worked with the police to combat domestic extremism and to take violent criminals off the street.<br><br>Steve’s record makes him ready on day one to lead this agency.<br><br>And, by the way, in 2009, the U.S. Senate unanimously confirmed him to serve as a U.S. Attorney.&nbsp; I look forward to working with the Senate to get him confirmed once again.</p>



<p>With what I’ve &#8212; know about him and why I was enthusiastic about supporting him, I’d like to introduce my nominee to lead the&nbsp;<s>AFT</s>&nbsp;[ATF] to you &#8212; all of you.&nbsp; Steve, come on up here.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>MR. DETTELBACH:&nbsp; Thank you, Mr. President; thank you, Vice President Harris, for your leadership in protecting the people of this nation and for placing your trust in me to become the next director of the ATF.&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br><br>Thank you, also, Deputy Attorney General Monaco, for all that you and Attorney General Garland continue to do at DOJ to make our nation safer.&nbsp;<br><br>And thank you, Mia, for your incredible inspiration and courage not just here today, but all over this nation.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>I also want to thank my incredible, supportive, and often patient family who are here.&nbsp; My wonderful wife, Karil, and my children, Allie and David.&nbsp; Please.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; When he&#8217;s 16 years old, I want to draft him.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;<br><br>MR. DETTELBACH:&nbsp; Is there an agent in the house?&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;<br><br>But seriously, more &#8212; most especially today, I want to thank the men and women of the ATF.&nbsp;<br><br>You know, I started as a career prosecutor back in 1992.&nbsp; And I have spent three decades watching and admiring agents and staff at the ATF &#8212; along with its federal, state, and local law enforcement partners &#8212; as they work tirelessly and courageously to protect the American people.&nbsp;<br><br>I would also say they work in anonymity, but that would not be completely true because, sadly, one thing I&#8217;ve also seen over the years is that the ATF often does work in anonymity when its agents are out there risking their lives to protect us only to be thrust into the public eye when it&#8217;s time for criticism.&nbsp;<br><br>You know, law enforcement is a very tough job, and no person and no agency is perfect.&nbsp; But the President is right: The men and women of the ATF and the public that they protect deserve better support from us.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br><br>I&#8217;ve seen firsthand the work that so many at the ATF do to protect us from violence.&nbsp; They&#8217;re dedicated, they&#8217;re professional, and they&#8217;re effective.&nbsp; They don&#8217;t write the laws; their mission every day is just to go out and enforce those laws and protect the public from a wide range of threats.&nbsp;<br><br>When I was a U.S. Attorney, our office partnered with the ATF and the Cleveland Police as they doggedly investigated and brought a case involving the deadliest home arson in Cleveland history &#8212; killed nine people, including eight kids.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>I also saw the ATF partner with the FBI and our office, first to find and then to bring to justice a bigot who drove from Indiana to outside Toledo to torch the largest mosque in Ohio.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>And last and certainly not least, I have partnered with the ATF for decades in its crucial fight against gun violence.&nbsp;<br><br>You know, whether it was taking a single violent recidivist off the street in Maryland or putting together a big racketeering case against a violent gang in Youngstown, Ohio, I have seen the ATF work with other law enforcement to make so many of our communities safer.&nbsp;<br><br>As we emerge from this pandemic, we’ve got to recognize that many Americans still face fear and isolation not because of a virus, but because of an epidemic of firearms violence.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not a new problem, and it has many causes.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s going to take an all-hands-on-deck-partnership approach to address that issue.&nbsp; And the ATF will be there.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>If confirmed, I promise to support the men and the women of the ATF and to do everything in our power to protect the people of this nation every single day.&nbsp;<br><br>Thank you.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; All right, good job.&nbsp;<br><br>MR. DETTELBACH:&nbsp; Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Thank you all for coming.&nbsp;<br><br>And, by the way, he was responsible for the weather as well.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Thank you, thank you, thank you.<br><br>MR. DETTELBACH:&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>3:05 P.M. EDT</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Via Teleconference</p>



<p>12:39&nbsp;P.M. EDT</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Great, thank you.&nbsp; And thank everyone for joining.&nbsp; So, as a reminder, this call is on background, attributable to a senior administration official, and the contents of the call are embargoed until the end of the call.</p>



<p>For your awareness and not for reporting, our speaker on the call today is [senior administration official].&nbsp; So, with that, I’ll turn it over to you for some quick remarks at the top, and then we’ll take some questions.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; Thanks, [moderator], and thank you to everyone for joining.&nbsp; As [moderator] said, I will do some remarks and we&#8217;ll do a few questions afterwards.</p>



<p>I just wanted to talk about the meeting that President Biden just held with Prime Minister Modi.&nbsp; He met virtually with Prime Minister Modi, and this is ahead of the U.S.-India 2+2 ministerial that Secretary Blinken and Secretary Austin are holding today with their Indian counterparts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>President Biden last spoke to Prime Minister Modi in early March, along with other Quad leaders.&nbsp; And as you all remember, President Biden welcomed Prime Minister Modi in person to the White House last September.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During the course of the meeting, President Biden affirmed that our partnership with India is one of our most important relationships, and the two leaders had a chance to have an hourlong, very candid conversation to discuss a range of bilateral and global issues.&nbsp; The meeting was warm and productive, and they covered a lot of ground.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The leaders were able to talk about joint efforts on the global effort to end the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp; They talked about climate.&nbsp; They talked about strengthening the global economy.&nbsp; And they talked about upholding a free and open Indo-Pacific, including the development of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework and infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And President Biden also took the opportunity to continue the close consultations we&#8217;ve been having with India at a number of different levels across our government and over the course of many weeks on Russia&#8217;s brutal war against Ukraine.&nbsp; The U.S. and India are partnering and consulting on mitigating the most destabilizing impacts, both on global food supply and other commodity markets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And throughout the course of the 2+2, today, Secretary Blinken and Secretary Austin, of course, will have the chance to go over these issues and many more, including sanctions compliance &#8212; again, including cooperation on food supply, including energy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And the 2+2 will cover also science and technology partnership initiatives.&nbsp; They’ll cover people-to-people ties.&nbsp; They will cover counterterrorism; operationalizing the Major Defense Partnership; new domains of cooperation in space and cyber and emerging technologies; and multilateral cooperation.</p>



<p>But the leaders meeting at the top was a very useful touchpoint for the two of them to share perspective on a range of issues.</p>



<p>So, let me stop there and take a couple of questions.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; Can we cue up the directions to ask a question, please?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Could you talk a little bit about whether there was any discussion on the call about the energy purchases that India is making from Russia, and whether those need to stop and whether there&#8217;s any formal kind of agreement about what that would look like?&nbsp; Thank you very much.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; The two leaders covered the whole range of issues related to Russia-Ukraine.&nbsp; It was a very candid conversation.&nbsp; I think you will have seen &#8212; even in Prime Minister Modi&#8217;s remarks at the top to press, he talked about it as well.&nbsp; They were very direct conversations.</p>



<p>On the energy issues: Of course, it&#8217;s a subject of discussion.&nbsp; We&#8217;re aware of what India &#8212; you know, we haven&#8217;t asked India to do anything in particular; we&#8217;re having a very open conversation.&nbsp; We know that not all countries will be able to do what we&#8217;ve done.&nbsp; We know that India is not a major consumer of Russian oil.&nbsp; Its current imports are about 1 to 2 percent of its total energy imports.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, as of now, our energy payments &#8212; our energy payments are exempt from current sanctions.&nbsp; And we&#8217;ve been very clear that we&#8217;ve been able to ban oil and LNG and coal imports from Russia, but other countries have to make their own choices.</p>



<p>That said, we don’t think India should accelerate or increase imports of Russian energy.&nbsp; And the U.S. is ready to support India, remain in a conversation with India about its diversification of imports.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey there.&nbsp; Following up on the last question, but maybe in a &#8212; in a little bit broader way: India has obviously been among the nations that had been more reticent to speak out against the war in Ukraine.&nbsp; They&#8217;ve obviously abstained from several votes at the U.N., including the vote the other day to withdraw &#8212; to remove Russia from the Human Rights Council.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What &#8212; did the President bring that up?&nbsp; Did the President &#8212; is this an opportunity for the President to try to push India to be &#8212; you know, essentially to take a side here, as opposed to the sort of neutral position that they&#8217;ve taken?&nbsp; Did he specifically do that?&nbsp; Did he specifically ask India to take a side?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; So, India is going to make its own judgments.&nbsp; Prime Minister Modi brought up the situation, again, in his public remarks, and there was discussion.&nbsp; I mean, the President shared his views, and Prime Minister Modi shared his views.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You will have seen in recent days that India made some pretty strong statements in New York condemning the killings of civilians, supporting calls for an independent investigation.&nbsp; India is also providing humanitarian relief material to Ukraine, including medicine and other supplies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There were close consultations in early days about the Indian students that were &#8212; needed to be evacuated from Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So we&#8217;re going to continue these discussions with India.&nbsp; I think India will make its own decisions, but we&#8217;re going to continue the discussions.</p>



<p>And as I mentioned earlier, there were conversations about how to mitigate the destabilizing impacts of Putin&#8217;s war, including on food supply, where India is in a position to assist &#8212; has done some things, and there was discussion about what more India might be able to do.</p>



<p>Q    Hi.  Thank you, guys.  Sort of following up, actually, on both the prior questions &#8212; I was wondering if any explicit commitments were made by India in regards either on oil but more broadly.  I know you said that the Prime Minister made some comments at the beginning that were public where he seemed to use stronger words to condemn Russia&#8217;s behavior.  Was that a sort of satisfactory condemnation from the Biden administration&#8217;s perspective?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; What I&#8217;ll say is that Prime Minister Modi took the opportunity to share his views in a pretty candid way about what&#8217;s going on.&nbsp;<br><br>We know that Russia has concerns &#8212; we know that India has concerns about the links between Russia and China.&nbsp; India, of course, is facing a very tense situation along the Line of Actual Control.&nbsp; And when India sees the tight links between China and Russia, that&#8217;s obviously going to impact their thinking.<br><br>Whether there was &#8212; there was no sort of concrete ask and concrete answer, but the leaders were able to step back and have a pretty detailed and candid exchange of views.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, thank you.&nbsp; Thank you for doing this.&nbsp; I wanted to ask you if the neighborhood was discussed, because the situations in both Sri Lanka and Pakistan is not that very good.&nbsp; Did that issue came up for discussion, and what was it?<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Yes, the leaders did discuss developments in the region, in South Asia.&nbsp; They touched on some of the developments in Sri Lanka, in Bangladesh.&nbsp; And I know that our State Department colleagues will be able to follow up on those discussions.&nbsp; It wasn&#8217;t a detailed discussion by the leaders, but it did come up.&nbsp; And I am positive there will be more detailed discussions throughout the course of the next day and a half.</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; All right.&nbsp; Well, thanks, everyone, for joining.&nbsp; As a reminder, this call was on background, attributable to a “senior administration official.”&nbsp; And the embargo on the call will lift at the end of this call.&nbsp;<br><br>If you have any other questions, please feel free to reach out to me and we&#8217;ll make sure to get back to you.&nbsp;<br><br>Thanks, everyone.</p>

<p>11:24 A.M. EDT<br> <br>PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Prime Minister Modi, it’s always good to see you.  I’m looking forward to seeing you in Japan, about the 24th of May.  And I was honored to welcome you to the White House last September to discuss U.S.-India relations, to meet with our fellow Quad leaders.  <br> <br>And I&#8217;m pleased to have this opportunity to speak with you today virtually and with your two ministers and your ambassador here in person.  <br> <br>(Referring to the language interpretation.)  Is it contemporaneous? <br> <br>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  Yes, (inaudible).<br> <br>PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Oh, I&#8217;m sorry.  (Laughs.)<br> <br>As two vibrant democracies who &#8212; one is learning how to make sure I can do this contemporaneously, but &#8212; two vibrant democracies, we have a &#8212; we take the same concerns about the global challenges we face &#8212; from COVID-19, advancing health security, and tracking the climate crisis &#8212; and we share a strong and growing Major Defense Partnership. <br> <br>At the root of our partnership is a deep connection between our people &#8212; ties of family, of friendship, and of shared values.  <br> <br>On that note, I want to welcome India&#8217;s humanitarian support for the people of Ukraine, who are suffering a horrific assault, including a tragic shelling in a train station last week that killed dozens of innocent children and women and civilians attempting to flee the violence.<br> <br>The United States and India are going to continue our close consultation on how to manage the destabilizing effects of this Russian war.  <br> <br>And I&#8217;m looking forward to our discussions today, Mr. Prime Minister.  Our continued consultation and dialogue are key to ensuring the U.S.-India relationship continues to grow deeper and stronger, delivering our people and our global good &#8212; good that we all are seeking to manage, particularly in your part of the world. <br> <br>And the floor is yours, Mr. Prime Minister.<br> <br>PRIME MINISTER MODI:  (As interpreted.)  President Biden, I would like to, first of all, express my gratitude to you for your warm words.  Our defense and foreign ministers will be meeting today in the 2+2 format in a short while from now.<br> <br>Our meeting before that is very important, as it will provide direction for the discussions.  I also appreciate your initiative to organize today&#8217;s virtual meeting.<br> <br>Excellency, when I was in Washington last year in September &#8212; and you, in fact, mentioned that &#8212; you had said at the time that the India-America partnership can contribute to solving a lot of global problems.  I totally agree with you.<br> <br>As two democracies that are the world’s largest and oldest, we are natural partners.  And the progress that has taken place in our relations in the last few years, the new momentum that has been created would have been hard to even imagine a few decades ago.<br> <br>Excellency, our talks today are taking place at a time when the situation in Ukraine is very worrying.<br> <br>A few weeks ago, over 20,000 Indians were stuck in Ukraine, and most of them were young students.  After a lot of hard work, we were successful in getting them all out safely.  One student, however, lost his life.<br> <br>During this entire process, I spoke several times on the phone to the presidents of both Ukraine and Russia.  I not only appealed for peace, but also suggested that there be direct talks between President Putin and the President of Ukraine.<br> <br>We had extensive discussions on Ukraine in our parliament as well. <br> <br>Recently, the news about the killings of innocent civilians in the Bucha city was very worrying.  We instantly condemned the killings and have called for an independent inquiry.  <br> <br>We hope that the ongoing discussions between Russia and Ukraine will lead to peace.<br> <br>Excellency, we have also emphasized the importance of the security of civilians in Ukraine and the unhindered supply of humanitarian assistance to them &#8212; and you mentioned this, in fact. <br> <br>On our part, we have sent medicines and other relief material to Ukraine and to its neighboring countries.  And on Ukraine&#8217;s request, we will be sending them another consignment of medicines very soon.<br> <br>Excellency, at the beginning of your term in office, you’d used a very important slogan: “Democracies can deliver.”  The India-America partnership and the success of the India-America partnership is the best means to make this slogan meaningful.<br> <br>This year, India is celebrating 75 years of its independence, and we are also celebrating the 75th anniversary of our diplomatic relations as well.  I am confident that our friendship with America will be an integral part of India&#8217;s development journey over the next 25 years.<br> <br>Once again, my thanks to you for organizing this event.<br> <br>PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister.  We&#8217;re going to hold for just a moment, Mr. Prime Minister, while the press leaves the room.  <br> <br>11:31 A.M. EDT</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>President Biden is committed to creating an economy that works for every American. Part of that agenda is to ensure that families in Puerto Rico are treated fairly in our tax system. Historically, the prior Child Tax Credit (CTC) only applied to families in Puerto Rico with three or more qualifying children, and therefore only 10% of families with children were eligible.<br>&nbsp;<br>That changed when President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan (ARP). It not only provided the largest Child Tax Credit nationwide to the most ever families, it also made sure that, for the first time, families and children in Puerto Rico fully benefited – permanently fixing the credit to give Puerto Rico families equal access. This tax filing season, 97% of Puerto Rico families with children are now eligible for the expanded CTC. The law also <em><u>permanently</u></em> changed the structure of the CTC so that every child in Puerto Rico will get the credit on the same basis as all other American children. This will mean that parents in Puerto Rico will have, as President Biden says, a “little more breathing room” in meeting the costs of raising a family and that there will be fewer children in Puerto Rico living in poverty.<br>&nbsp;<br>The ARP also meant a historic expansion of the federal government’s commitment to expand the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) in Puerto Rico. Together, the expanded CTC and EITC could provide an estimated $1 billion annually in critical benefits to hundreds of thousands of low- and moderate-income working people and families in Puerto Rico.<br>&nbsp;<br>Today, as part of a final push to encourage families in Puerto Rico to file their taxes and receive both the CTC and EITC, First Lady Dr. Jill Biden, Education Secretary Miguel Cardona, House Chairwoman Nydia Velazquez, Deputy Secretary of Treasury Wally Adeyemo, and American Rescue Plan Coordinator Gene Sperling are holding a special virtual event with UnidosUS, the Hispanic Federation, the Institute of Youth Development/Instituto del Desarrollo de la Juventud (IDJ), Espacios Abiertos, and United Way of Puerto Rico. The Biden Administration and these leading non-profits are urging families to file their taxes by April 18<sup>th</sup> to take advantage of this critical aid.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>The American Rescue Plan made historic, permanent changes to the Child Tax Credit for Puerto Rico families – making the credit available to 97% of Puerto Rico families this year, compared to 10% before the ARP</strong></p>



<ul><li>Previously, <strong><em><u>only Puerto Rico families with three or more qualifying children or more qualified for any Child Tax Credit benefit</u></em></strong>.<br></li><li>This meant that before the American Rescue Plan, <strong><em><u>only about 10% of Puerto Rico families qualified for any Child Tax Credit.<br></u></em></strong></li><li>The ARP permanently changed that policy to extend the CTC to Puerto Rico families with fewer than three qualifying children who were previously excluded. <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/blog/tax-credit-expansions-expected-to-significantly-reduce-poverty-in-puerto-rico">As a result</a> of the ARP, <strong><em><u>97% of Puerto Rico families with children are eligible for the 2021 Child Tax Credit.<br></u></em></strong></li><li>For 2021, the ARP increased the Child Tax Credit to <strong><em><u>$3,600 per child under 6 and $3,000 per child 6-17</u></em></strong> – and ensured that lower income families could access the full credit.<br></li><li>In addition, the ARP provided the first-ever federal support for Puerto Rico’s local Earned Income Tax Credit – allowing Puerto Rico to <strong><u>more than</u></strong> triple EITC <strong><u>benefits</u></strong> and extend <strong><u>the EITC</u></strong> to more workers for the next 10 years.</li></ul>



<p>Together, the ARP’s expansions of the CTC and EITC are&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-tax/american-rescue-plan-act-provides-critical-permanent-tax-relief-to-puerto-rico">estimated</a>&nbsp;to <strong>provide over $1 billion in tax relief</strong> per year going forward. They stand to benefit hundreds of thousands of Puerto Rico families – with the families of over 500,000 children eligible for the 2021 expanded CTC.<br><br><strong>Today’s event builds on substantial White House-Treasury Department efforts to ensure access to the 2021 Child Tax Credit in Puerto Rico:</strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>The White House and Treasury Department in collaboration with UnidosUS created a Weekly CTC/EITC Puerto Rico Working Group, with the Youth Development Institute (IDJ), Espacios Abiertos, Hispanic Federation, and others, to increase awareness and take up rates</strong> among newly eligible families in Puerto Rico for the CTC and Local EITC. This group is comprised of representatives of the Puerto Rico government, Hacienda (the local tax authority), Treasury, IRS, and local stakeholders — including community-based organizations and other advocates in Puerto Rico – who work to remove barriers for the implementation of tax credit policies. Collaboration across these groups has already led to the execution or launch of over 35 local community events, navigator trainings and capacity building engagements for local elected officials and municipal staff. More than 240 municipal and state agencies employees were trained to scale and implement integrated outreach strategies and provide free tax preparation services for low-to-middle income communities.<br></li><li><strong>The White House and Treasury Department collaborated closely with the Governor of Puerto Rico, Mayors, foundations and NGOs on the island to increase awareness and CTC sign-ups in Puerto Rico. </strong>The White House ARP Implementation Coordinator, White House Intergovernmental Affairs and Treasury teams met twice at the White House with the Governor of Puerto Rico on CTC outreach strategy and had several meetings with top Puerto Rican mayors. The White House ARP Implementation Team also organized several meetings with foundations on the importance of investing in CTC outreach in Puerto Rico.<br></li><li><strong>The Administration launched a stand-alone section of ChildTaxCredit.gov for Puerto Rico families and outreach partners. </strong><a href="https://www.childtaxcredit.gov/es/puerto-rico/">Childtaxcredit.gov/es/puerto-rico/</a> highlights the unique and unprecedented access for families with children to benefit from the enhanced CTC and provides information on how to claim the credit in plain language, Spanish, and a mobile friendly format.<br></li><li><strong>The Treasury Department and the White House worked to build capacity for Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) Centers and Facilitated Self-Assistance (FSA) Sites</strong>, including through navigator training and volunteer recruitment scale-up for tax prep assistance in low income communities. Currently there are 43 tax assistance sites, including VITA and FSA in the island.<br></li><li><strong>The Administration amplified the island-wide public campaign by the Alliance for Economic Security in Puerto Rico, and garnering support from state/local government. </strong>The Alliance, composed by the Hispanic Federation, Instituto del Desarrollo de la Juventud (IDJ) and Espacios Abiertos coalesced to launch &nbsp;<a href="https://reclamatudineropr.com/">ReclamaTuDineroPR.com</a> to further promote awareness of these tax benefits. In addition, the Administration has helped amplify these efforts and match trained IRS volunteers with Mayors and municipalities to host “Fill-a-thons” (“Llenatones” in Spanish) &#8211; to ensure all families with children learn about the credit and can receive tax filing assistance through a local community event.&nbsp;<br></li><li><strong>Treasury provided training for mayors in Puerto Rico on how to leverage ARP State &amp; Fiscal Recovery Funds (SLFRF) to do CTC and EITC outreach and tax filing assistance outreach </strong>in collaboration with the White House, the Government of Puerto Rico, the Association of Mayors, and the Federation of Mayors of Puerto Rico to maximize critical State and Local ARP funds for local governments in Puerto Rico.</li></ul>

<p>Today, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. announced that former U.S. Senator Christopher Dodd of Connecticut and former U.S. Representative Debbie Mucarsel-Powell of Florida will serve as special advisors for the Ninth Summit of the Americas that will take place from June 6 through June 10 in Los Angeles, California.</p>



<p>Senator Dodd served as a member and Chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere for over three decades. Senator Dodd and President Biden worked closely together on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for over 28 years. Senator Dodd’s interest in Latin America began years before his election to the U.S. Congress. In the 1960s, Dodd joined President John Kennedy’s Peace Corps, serving for two years as a volunteer in the Dominican Republic. During his service in the Peace Corps and in the Senate, he traveled extensively and on numerous occasions throughout the hemisphere.</p>



<p>As the first and only Latina Democrat to ever represent a Congressional district in Florida, and the first-ever Member of Congress born in Ecuador, Congresswoman Mucarsel-Powell was a leading voice in the charge to support Venezuelans fleeing their country through securing Temporary Protected Status in the United States and providing humanitarian and other aid to the Venezuelan people and neighboring countries. She served as chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Women’s Task Force and also sponsored environmental and public health legislation.</p>



<p>Senator Dodd and Congresswoman Mucarsel-Powell are confident that President Biden will renew and strengthen the collaboration and respect essential for a bright future for the Americas at the upcoming Summit in Los Angeles this June.</p>



<p>The Summit of the Americas, the only meeting that brings together the leaders of North, South, and Central America and the Caribbean, will play a central role in shaping the future of the Americas at a critical time in our history.&nbsp; The region’s governments, civil society, and private sector will work to develop a shared vision built around the theme for this year’s meeting, “Building a Sustainable, Resilient, and Equitable Future.”</p>



<p>The United States looks forward to welcoming the hemisphere to Los Angeles to work together on strengthening our democracies, building more prosperous and inclusive economies, and better protecting the human rights, health, dignity, and security of our people.  The United States previously hosted the inaugural Summit of the Americas in Miami, Florida, in 1994.</p>
