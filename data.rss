<p>Today, President Joe Biden announced his intent to appoint Dr. Mitchel Berger, Dr. Carol Brown, and Dr. Elizabeth Jaffee to the President’s Cancer Panel. The three are distinguished members of the scientific, research, and public health communities appointed by the President to advise him on barriers to and opportunities for progress in reducing the burden of cancer.</p>



<p>In addition, First Lady Jill Biden, Cabinet Members, and Biden-Harris Administration leadership are holding a Cancer Cabinet meeting today to unveil priority actions and new members, advancing the President’s vision for ending cancer as we know it. The Cancer Cabinet has identified priorities to: (1) close the screening gap, (2) understand and address environmental exposure, (3) decrease the impact of preventable cancers, (4) bring cutting edge research through the pipeline to patients and communities, and (5) support patients and caregivers. This Cancer Cabinet also added the Departments of Commerce and Labor, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and the White House Gender Policy Council.</p>



<p>Since the Cancer Cabinet’s prior meeting, additional steps that mark progress for the millions of Americans facing a cancer diagnosis have been announced by the Biden-Harris Administration including: the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issuing more than $200 million in grants to advance national cancer prevention and control through cancer screening programs reaching every state, U.S. territories, and tribal organizations; the Centers for Medicaid &amp; Medicare Services (CMS) launching a new model to deliver patient-centered care that improves outcomes and reduces the cost of cancer care; the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) announcing the extension of a program to fast-track cancer immunotherapy applications; the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) pursuing steps to significantly reduce tobacco-related morbidity and mortality in the United States as part of cancer prevention efforts, and announcing that for the first time in over 50 years, the White House will host a Conference on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health and release a national, whole-of-government strategy to end hunger and reduce diet-release disease (which includes some cancers) this September. &nbsp;</p>



<p>In February, President Biden reignited the Cancer Moonshot with renewed White House leadership and new ambitious goals: to reduce the death rate from cancer by at least 50 percent over the next 25 years, and improve the experience of people and their families living with and surviving cancer –&nbsp;and, by doing this and more, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/02/02/fact-sheet-president-biden-reignites-cancer-moonshot-to-end-cancer-as-we-know-it/">end cancer as we know it today</a>. In March, in his first State of the Union Address, President Biden highlighted the Cancer Moonshot as part of his Unity Agenda for the nation. The White House convened the Cancer Cabinet to establish a prioritized agenda across government including the development of new interagency programs and collaborations and announced <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/news-updates/2022/03/17/fact-sheet-white-house-announces-initial-steps-for-reignited-cancer-moonshot/">initial steps for the Cancer Moonshot</a>.</p>

<p><strong><u>Appointment of President’s Cancer Panel</u></strong></p>



<p>President Bidenselected <strong>new members of the President’s Cancer Panel</strong>, a volunteer panel of experts who advise the President on how to use the resources of the federal government, particularly through the cancer research program, to make progress for people facing a cancer diagnosis and to reduce the burden of cancer on the American population:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Dr. Elizabeth M. Jaffee,</strong> to serve as Chair, is an internationally recognized expert in cancer immunology and pancreatic cancer. She is the Deputy Director of the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, Co-Director of the Skip Viragh Pancreatic Cancer Center, and Associate Director of the Bloomberg Kimmel Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy. Jaffee is a Past President of the American Association for Cancer Research. She has served on a number of committees at the National Cancer Institute, including co-chair of the Blue Ribbon Panel that provided scientific advice to then-Vice President Biden’s Moonshot Initiative and as Past Chair of the National Cancer Advisory Board. She is the inaugural Director of the new Convergence Institute at Johns Hopkins. She was recently elected to the National Academy of Medicine and is a Fellow of the Academy of Immuno-Oncology, a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, a Fellow of the American Association of Cancer Research, and a Fellow of the American College of Physicians.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Dr. Mitchel Berger</strong> is a Neurological Surgeon who has spent his entire career taking care of and operating on patients with brain tumors. In addition, he has been funded by the National Institutes of Health and National Cancer Institute (NCI) to conduct basic science research in brain tumor biology including the molecular markers that determine the growth and treatment patterns of these tumors. For 20 years, Berger has been the Principal Investigator for Brain SPORE (Specialized Program of Research Excellence), funded by NCI, and he directs the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) Brain Tumor Center, composed of its NeuroOncology Clinical Trials Program and Brain Tumor Research Center. Previously, he served as Chair of the Department of Neurological Surgery at UCSF and following 23 years of service in this capacity remains a full time Professor of Neurological Surgery at UCSF. Berger also served as the President of two leading national organizations, the American Association of Neurological Surgeons and the Society of NeuroOncology. He served as a member of the Blue Ribbon Panel for the Cancer Moonshot Initiative led by then-Vice President Biden under the direction of President Obama.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Dr. Carol Brown</strong> is a board-certified gynecologic oncologist who is the Senior Vice President and Chief Health Equity Officer at Memorial Sloan Kettering (MSK) Cancer Center and the incumbent of the Nicholls-Biondi Chair for Health Equity. Brown’s career is focused on three areas: providing high-quality and compassionate surgical care to women with gynecologic cancer; eliminating cancer health disparities; and promoting public policy to increase awareness, improve care, and increase research funding for gynecologic and other cancers. As MSK’s Chief Health Equity Officer, Brown addresses cancer disparities that exist due to racial, ethnic, cultural, or socioeconomic barriers, and is responsible for center-wide initiatives to achieve health equity for medically underserved populations. This includes efforts to increase participation in clinical trials such as the Cancer Health Equities Research Program, a unique partnership between MSK investigators and community oncologists to bring MSK clinical trials to underserved patients at their local institutions. Brown’s national leadership positions include serving as the 50<sup>th</sup> President of the Society of Gynecologic Oncology (SGO), former Co-Chair of the NRG Oncology Health Disparities Committee, and as a member of the American College of Surgeons Board of Regents. Brown was the first Black female to lead the SGO, an organization whose 2,000 members are dedicated to caring for women with gynecologic cancers and advancing research in the field.</li></ul>



<p><strong><u>Priority Actions for the Cancer Cabinet</u></strong></p>



<p>When President Biden re-ignited the Cancer Moonshot, he announced seven pillars that define how we know cancer today to provide a shared agenda on which to make progress. This includes possibilities for progress in cancer early detection, prevention, equity, precision medicine, rare and childhood cancer, supporting patients and caregivers, and learning from patients. The Cancer Cabinet outlined the following priority actions on which agencies are working together and through their own programming to make progress on this vision for ending cancer as we know it.&nbsp;</p>



<ol type="1"><li><strong>Close the Screening Gap:</strong> Americans missed nearly 10 million cancer screenings as compared to prior years due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Through targeted and coordinated programs, we should cut that deficit by providing access to more cancer screening opportunities and expand equitable access to cancer early detection.</li></ol>



<ul><li><strong>Understand and Address Environmental and Toxic Exposures: </strong>Studies have shownthat exposure to some environmental contaminants and toxic chemicals can lead to a higher risk of certain types of cancer. Through a robust scientific research and regulatory agenda, the United States can do more to understand the impact of environmental exposure in an effort to better regulate and eliminate exposures related to cancer.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Decrease the Impact of Preventable Cancers: </strong>Thanks to scientific advancements, there are more tools today than ever before to prevent cancer. There are also healthy lifestyle choices like nutrition, tobacco cessation, others as well as tools such as the HPV vaccine and Hepatitis C antivirals that can prevent cervical, head and neck, and liver cancer, respectively. Additionally, advances in colonoscopy technology enable detection and removal of pre-cancerous growths to prevent the development of colon cancer in more individuals. Additional efforts are needed to expand access to these cancer-prevention approaches along with public health campaigns and community health efforts to ensure these preventative tools are reaching all populations. In doing so, there is opportunity to nearly or wholly eliminate certain cancer types.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Bring Cutting Edge Research Through the Pipeline to Patients and Communities: </strong>The development and deployment of new ways to prevent, detect, and treat cancer will be necessary to increase cancer survival rates. In order to reach the goal of better targeting treatments to the right patients and designing new approaches to drive progress for some of the deadliest and rare cancers, including childhood cancers, investment and innovation in cancer research programs is essential.&nbsp; In addition, we must support the pipeline from discovery to clinical research that involves more populations, and ensure treatment innovations reach patients in communities across the United States.</li></ul>



<p><strong>5) Support Patients and Caregivers: </strong>Cancer can be overwhelming to any person or family and gaps in support can lead to gaps in quality care. The Biden-Harris Administration seeks to make the experience around cancer – from screening, to getting a diagnosis, to treatment, care and survivorship – easier on those living with cancer and their caregivers. That means supporting people as they navigate through these steps, making it easier for people to access screening and diagnostics, bringing trials and quality care closer to home, providing patients and caregivers with the data and knowledge they need to make informed care decisions, and giving people with cancer and the people who care for them a seat at the table to improve our oncology system.</p>



<p><strong><u>Expanded Cancer Cabinet Delivers on Cancer Moonshot Goals</u></strong></p>



<p>Today, President Biden’s vision for an all-of-government response to the goals of the Cancer Moonshot expands to include <strong>the U.S. Departments of Labor and Commerce, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and the White House Gender Policy Council</strong>. This new leadership brings new capacity from, for example, the Department of Labor to support patients and caregivers with knowledge and resources regarding their rights to take time related to a cancer diagnosis as well as advancing a regulatory agenda to further protect workers in different settings. The Department of Commerce brings new perspectives and capabilities to speed innovation through the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and the advanced manufacturing and research capabilities of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). NASA’s expertise in radiation and extreme environment provides the ability to support ground-breaking research, including on the International Space Station, expanding the tools we have to find new approaches to prevent, detect, and treat cancer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additional Cancer Cabinet announcements to support progress as part of the Cancer Moonshot include:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) Improves Access to Colon Cancer Screening</strong></li></ul>



<p>To reduce barriers to getting a colonoscopy, <a href="https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cms-proposes-physician-payment-rule-expand-access-high-quality-care">CMS is proposing</a> that a follow-up colonoscopy to an at-home test be considered, for coverage purposes, a “preventive service,” which means that cost sharing would be waived for people with Medicare. Additionally, Medicare is proposing to cover the service for individuals 45 years of age and above, in line with the newly-lowered age recommendation (down from age 50) from the United States Preventative Services Task Force. Colon and rectal cancer were the second-leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States in 2020, with higher colorectal cancer death rates for Black and American Indian and Alaskan Native individuals.</p>



<ul><li><strong>CMS Launches New Model to Improve Patient Care and Outcomes, Reduce Costs: </strong>Last week, <a href="https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/enhancing-oncology-model">CMS launched a new, voluntary Enhancing Oncology Model (EOM)</a> designed to test how to best place cancer patients at the center of the care team that provides high-value, equitable, evidence-based care. The EOM aims to improve care coordination, quality, and health outcomes for patients, while also holding oncology practices accountable for total costs of care to make cancer care more affordable and accessible for beneficiaries and Medicare. This model incorporates many lessons learned from the Oncology Care Model (OCM) – which launched as part of the Cancer Moonshot in 2016 – in addition to feedback from the oncology community, including OCM participants, patient advocacy groups, oncology professional associations, and others.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>USPTO Announced Further Extending the Fast-Track Program for Cancer Products: </strong>The <a href="https://www.uspto.gov/subscription-center/2022/uspto-extends-cancer-immunotherapy-pilot-program-until-september-30-2022">USPTO announced a further extension</a> of its <em>Patents for Patients</em> or <em>Cancer Immunotherapy Pilot Program,</em> which provides special status to high-priority innovations in cancer treatment. The USPTO first implemented the program in June 2016, in support of the Cancer Moonshot initiative. This program provides a fast-track review for cancer immunotherapy-related patent applications without the need for applicants to pay a petition fee. Under this program, patent applications pertaining to cancer immunotherapy are advanced out of turn for examination, resulting in their accelerated review, cutting in half the time it takes to review patent applications pertaining to cancer immunotherapy.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Provides More Than $200M for Evidence-Based Cancer Screening Programs:</strong> In June, the CDC <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2022/p0608-cancer-award.html">announced first-year funding awards of $215 million</a> in a 5-year, $1.1 billion investment into three national programs to prevent and control cancer. Eighty-six unique recipients from state, local, tribal, and territorial public health organizations and academic institutions received funding, representing all states, the District of Columbia, 18 tribal organizations, five U.S. territories, and three freely-associated states. Funded programs will demonstrate how proven strategies advance health equity and build capacity in cancer prevention and control. Outcomes include improving the provision of clinical preventive services; facilitating planning among partners to promote evidence-based strategies in communities; and improving cancer surveillance.</li></ul>



<p><strong><u>About the Cancer Cabinet</u></strong></p>



<p>When President Biden re-ignited the Cancer Moonshot in February 2022, he announced a whole- of-government response, including the formation of a Cancer Cabinet to be convened by the White House, bringing together departments, agencies, and other White House components across government to address cancer on multiple fronts. Initially, these included the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Department of Defense (DOD), Department of Energy (DOE), Department of Agriculture (USDA), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), Domestic Policy Council (DPC), Office of the First Lady (OFL), Office of the Vice President (OVP), Office of Management and Budget (OMB), Office of Legislative Affairs (OLA), Office of Public Engagement (OPE), along with additional members, as needed, to help establish and make progress on Cancer Moonshot goals.</p>

<p>The President is announcing six new federal judicial nominees, all of whom are extraordinarily qualified, experienced, and devoted to the rule of law and our Constitution.</p>



<p>These choices also continue to fulfill the President’s promise to ensure that the nation’s courts reflect the diversity that is one of our greatest assets as a country — both in terms of personal and professional backgrounds.</p>



<p>For example, if confirmed, this slate would include:</p>



<ul><li>The first Hispanic judge to serve on the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts</li><li>The first Hispanic judge to serve on the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York</li><li>The first openly LGBTQ Article III judge to serve in the state of Virginia</li></ul>



<p>This is President Biden’s twenty-second round of nominees for federal judicial positions and his ninth slate of nominations in 2022, bringing the number of announced federal judicial nominees to 118.</p>



<p>President Biden has spent decades committed to strengthening the federal bench, which is why he continues to move rapidly to fill judicial vacancies. And he has won confirmation of the most lower court judges for the first year of a presidency since the Kennedy Administration.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>Officials from the White House Gender Policy Council, Office of Public Engagement, and Office of the Vice President convened a listening session on the impact that abortion bans and other restrictions have on survivors of sexual assault and/or domestic violence and their ability to access reproductive health care. The advocates and leaders who participated represented national, state-wide, and local organizations that provide services, support, and advocacy for survivors. They shared insights from service providers working with survivors in states where abortion is now banned, or severely curtailed, following the Supreme Court’s ruling in <em>Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization</em>. They also discussed the ways in which restrictions on survivors’ most personal health care decisions violate their privacy and create additional safety concerns for victims of domestic violence and sexual assault. Advocates also raised the disproportionate impact that these state bans have on survivors from historically marginalized or underserved communities.</p>



<p>While critical of the abortion bans in several states that have no exceptions for rape or incest, advocates also highlighted how those that do have such limited exceptions also fail to meet the needs of survivors; most victims of sexual violence do not report it, nor should they have to in order to be able to access a full range of reproductive health care options, including abortion.&nbsp; Advocates who work with survivors of sexual and domestic violence indicated how concepts such as bodily autonomy and consent are crucial to the work of preventing sexual violence. They emphasized that taking away survivors’ right to make decisions about their own reproductive health further compounds the trauma they experience, and has long-term implications. Advocates also highlighted how crucial it is to protect the confidentiality and autonomy of all survivors in order to protect their safety and well-being.</p>



<p>White House officials thanked the leaders and advocates for their dedication to helping survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault. They underscored the President’s commitment to supporting all survivors in their ability to access services, safety, justice, and healing, as well as his commitment to defending reproductive rights for all Americans.</p>



<p>Organizations that participated in the listening session included:</p>



<ul><li>National Alliance to End Sexual Violence</li><li>National Network to End Domestic Violence</li><li>National Coalition Against Domestic Violence</li><li>Esperanza United</li><li>New Mexico Coalition of Sexual Assault Programs</li><li>Ohio Alliance to End Sexual Violence</li><li>Metropolitan Organization to Counter Sexual Assault, Kansas City, MO</li></ul>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>South Court Auditorium<br><em>Eisenhower Executive Office Building</em></em></p>

good morning.<br> <br>What an array of extraordinary American leaders.  So, thank you all for being here and for the work you’re doing every day.<br> <br>And, Secretary Walsh, I want to thank you for that introduction, but mostly I want to thank you for the work that you have done your entire career.<br> <br>And as he said, he and I have been traveling the country together, and he is an extraordinary fighter for the working people of America.<br> <br>It is also good to be here with Gene Sperling.  And he has &#8212; as I mentioned to many of the leaders earlier, he has been working day and night to coordinate with you to ensure that the American people benefit directly from the American Rescue Plan.  So, Gene, I want to thank you for your leadership.<br> <br>And I want to also recognize a longstanding public servant and leader, Governor Roy Cooper, along with Governor Tom Wolf, who has done an extraordinary job during difficult times. <br> <br>So, thank you all, and to all of the local and state elected leaders for being here today.<br> <br>Before I begin, I will address this month&#8217;s CPI report.<br><br>There is no question that we still have work to do.  But it is important to note that these numbers do not fully reflect the recent drop in gas prices.<br> <br>Average national gas prices have fallen every day for nearly 30 days.  Since mid-June, prices are down 40 cents a gallon.<br> <br>Fighting inflation is one of our administration&#8217;s top economic priorities, which is why we have taken action to lower the cost of living for Americans &#8212; millions of Americans.<br> <br>We are releasing 1 million barrels of oil a day from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to lower prices at the pump.<br> <br>We reduced high-speed Internet bills for millions of Americans.<br><br>And we passed a tax cut to give working families up to $8,000 a year, which means giving folks more room in their budgets to buy food, medication, and school supplies for their children.<br> <br>President Joe Biden and I are always fighting to make sure that working families can get ahead and stay ahead.  And that is why we continue to call on Congress to pass legislation to lower the price of prescription drugs, of healthcare, and the other everyday essentials that will meet the needs of American families.  And so, helping working families is why we are here today.<br><br>When President Biden and I took office, our nation was facing its worst economic crisis in generations.  We all remember: Millions of jobs had been lost.  Millions of small businesses closed.  Millions of families pushed right to the edge.  But we were not deterred.  These leaders were not deterred.<br> <br>From day one, President Biden and I knew that to overcome these historic economic challenges, we needed to make an historic investment in our nation&#8217;s working families.  We needed to build an economy that works for working people.<br> <br>And that is why, with your help, we fought for and passed the American Rescue Plan, which included, among many things, a $40 billion investment in workforce development.<br> <br>Just think about that.  When we talk about an investment in workforce development, that is about a direct investment in working people in America.  It’s a direct investment in human capacity.  And for that reason, I know we’re all excited about what it means and the potential for where this will go for generations of workers in America.<br><br>So today it is an honor to gather with a group of leaders who are putting ARP dollars to work in communities across our nation &#8212; governors and mayors, city commissioners and county executives, workers and labor leaders.<br> <br>With your help, we are creating good-paying jobs in small towns and big cities; jobs for nurses and doctors; jobs for steelworkers, pipefitters, and engineers.<br><br>Together, we are investing in training programs and apprenticeships that give workers the skills they need to take on the jobs with better wages and better benefits &#8212; in particular, workers from underrepresented backgrounds.<br> <br>Together, we are expanding access to transportation.  It seems like maybe it’s a small issue; it’s a big issue.  You need to get to go and need to be able to get where you need to go to do the work and get home.<br><br>So we have expanded access to transportation, including what we need to invest in public transit, understanding that the infrastructure in our country around public transit is and has been in disrepair in many areas of our country.  And so that is the investment that we have put in there.<br><br>And together, we are fighting to improve and expand our childcare and healthcare workforce so that everyone who needs better care can have access to better care, no matter where they live and no matter how much money they make.<br> <br>That includes 8 million Americans who are part of the so-called sandwich generation, which means they’re right there in the middle, taking care of both their children and their parents.  And that includes people with mental and physical disabilities so they can access the critical care and support they need to succi- &#8212; -ceed and to thrive &#8212; to succeed and to thrive.<br> <br>Together, we are doing so much important and impactful work.  And we have, therefore, convened this summit with these extraordinary leaders so they can share their stories and share the stories of the people they represent, and so we can discuss how we can continue to work together on behalf of the working people of our nation.<br> <br>I have seen firsthand how much is possible when we collaborate across lines that relate to the direct benefit of the people of our nation.<br><br>In fact, earlier this year, I visited a union training facility in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  It’s called <s>WRPT</s> [WRTP]| BIG STEP.<br> <br>At BIG STEP, I met workers who had received training to remove and replace the lead pipes and service lines that are poisoning our communities.  It was truly an inspiration.<br> <br>As a result of their training, those workers can now access good-paying union jobs &#8212; jobs they can raise a family on, jobs they can build a future on, jobs that are helping us build a better future for our entire nation.<br> <br>Today, as many as 10 million homes and 400,000 schools and childcare facilities receive their water through lead pipes.  Graduates of BIG STEP are already removing lead pipes in Milwaukee &#8212; we have leaders from Milwaukee with us here today &#8212; and in communities across America.<br><br>BIG STEP is one of hundreds of job training facilities around our nation that received funding through the ARP.  Here with us today is Lindsay Blumer, President of <s>WRPT</s> [WRTP]| BIG STEP.  Where is &#8212; Lindsay, where are you?  There you are. <br> <br>And, Lindsay, and all of the leaders here, I want to thank you for all that you have done to make real the promise of the American Rescue Plan.<br><br>Since President Joe Biden and I took office, we have accomplished so much with your help, but we still have more to do.<br> <br>We must continue our work together to build a nation where every worker is treated with dignity, where every community is safe and healthy, and where every child can reach their God-given potential.  Because every person in our nation, no matter where they start, deserves the opportunity to succeed and to thrive.<br> <br>That is the future we are all fighting for, and that is the future our administration is fighting for &#8212; a future that we will all build together.<br> <br>God bless you.  And God bless the United States of America.  Thank you all.  Thank you.  (Applause.)<br><br>                              END                11:36 A.M.

<p class="has-text-align-center">Ben Gurion Airport<br>Tel Aviv, Israel</p>



<p>3:44 P.M. IDT </p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; President Herzog, Mr. Prime Minister Lapid, it’s an honor to once again stand with friends and visit the independent, Jewish State of Israel.</p>



<p>President Nixon was the first American president to visit Israel in 1974.</p>



<p>I was actually &#8212; my first visit was, as you mentioned, as a young United States senator from Delaware in 1973, just a few weeks before the Yom Kippur War.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I had the privilege of spending time with Prime Minister Golda Meir.&nbsp; I’ll never forget &#8212; I was sitting next to a gentleman on my right, one of her aides.&nbsp; His name was Rabin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I look back on it all now, and I realize that I had the great honor of living part of the great history of this great &#8212; and I did say and I say again, you need not be a Jew to be a Zionist.</p>



<p>The fact is that, since then, I’ve known every single Prime Minister and it’s been an honor, formed strong working relationships with each of them.</p>



<p>And now, this is my 10th visit.</p>



<p>Every chance to return to this great country, where the ancient roots of the Jewish people date back to biblical times,</p>



<p>is a blessing.&nbsp; Because the connection between the Israeli people and the American people is bone deep.&nbsp; It’s bone deep.</p>



<p>And generation after generation, that connection grows.&nbsp; We invest in each other.&nbsp; We dream together.&nbsp; We’re part of what has always been the objective we both have.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I’ve been part of that as a Senator, as a Vice President, and, quite frankly, before that, having been raised by a righteous Christian who &#8212; we had dinner at our table every night before he went back to work, and it was a place where we had conversation and, incidentally, ate.&nbsp; And I remember he taught us all about what happened in the Holocaust.&nbsp; “Why weren’t the tra- &#8212; tracks bombed?&nbsp; Why did we not &#8212; why, why, why?”&nbsp; And he imbued in us a sense of obligation that we all have.</p>



<p>And now, as President, I’m proud to say that our relationship with the State of Israel is deeper and stronger, in my view, than it’s ever been.</p>



<p>And with this visit, we are strengthening our connections even further.&nbsp; We’ve reaffirmed the unshakable commitment of the United States to Israel’s security, including partnering with</p>



<p>Israel on the most cutting-edge defense systems in the world.</p>



<p>From here, I’m going straight to a briefing on Israeli missiles and rocket defense capabilities, including the U.S. support for the Iron Dome and Israel’s new laser-enabled system</p>



<p>called the Iron Beam.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’re going to deepen our connections in science and innovation and work to address global challenges through the new Strategic High-Level Dialogue on Technology.</p>



<p>We’ll continue to advance Israel’s integration into the region; expand emerging forums and engagement &#8212; like the new I2U2 Summit, which will bring Israel, the United States, the UAE together, and India as well &#8212; to deepen economic cooperation between the Middle East and the Indo-Pacific.</p>



<p>Greater peace.&nbsp; Greater stability.&nbsp; Greater connection.</p>



<p>It’s critical.&nbsp; It&#8217;s critical, if I might add, for all the people of the region, which is why we&#8217;ll be &#8212; we&#8217;ll discuss my continued support &#8212; even though I know it&#8217;s not in the near-term &#8212; a two-state solution.&nbsp; That remains, in my view, the best way to ensure the future of equal measure of freedom, prosperity, and democracy for Israelis and Palestinians alike.</p>



<p>We’re going to celebrate the <s>ending of</s> [enduring] people-to-people connection and the enduring connection that binds our nations together, and commemorate the history that we must never allow to repeat itself.</p>



<p>Later today, I will once more return to the hallowed ground of Yad Sh- &#8212; Vashem to honor the 6 million Jewish lives that were stolen in a genocide and continue &#8212; which we must do every, every day &#8212; continue to bear witness, to keep alive the truth and <s>honor</s> [horror] of the Holocaust &#8212; horror of the Holocaust, honor those we lost so that we never, ever forget that lesson, you know, and to continue our shared, unending work to fight the poison of anti-Semitism wherever it raises its ugly head.  Wherever we find it in the world, we make real on the promise of “never again” by taking it on. </p>



<p>We have a full agenda over the next two days, because the relationship between Israel and the United States covers every issue that matters to our mutual futures.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We&#8217;re united in our shared values and are our shared vision.&nbsp; I’m looking forward to our time together over the next few days.&nbsp;</p>



<p>May Israel and the United States continue to grow and prosper together for the benefit of the entire world.&nbsp; And I mean that: for the benefit of the entire world.</p>



<p>Thank you.&nbsp; And God bless you all.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>While today’s headline inflation reading is unacceptably high, it is also out-of-date. Energy alone comprised nearly half of the monthly increase in inflation. Today’s data does not reflect the full impact of nearly 30 days of decreases in gas prices, that have reduced the price at the pump by about 40 cents since mid-June. Those savings are providing important breathing room for American families. And, other commodities like wheat have fallen sharply since this report.</p>



<p>Importantly, today’s report shows that what economists call annual “core inflation” came down for the third month in a row, and is the first month since last year where the annual “core” inflation rate is below six percent. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Inflation is our most pressing economic challenge. It is hitting almost every country in the world. It is little comfort to Americans to know that inflation is also high in Europe, and higher in many countries there than in America.&nbsp; But it is a reminder that all major economies are battling this COVID-related challenge, made worse by Putin’s unconscionable aggression.</p>



<p>Tackling inflation is my top priority &#8211; we need to make more progress, more quickly, in getting price increases under control. Here is what I will do:</p>



<p>First, I will continue to do everything I can to bring down the price of gas. I will continue my historic release of oil from our strategic petroleum reserve. I will continue working with our European allies to put a price cap on Russian oil – sapping Putin of oil revenue. And, I will continue to work with the U.S. oil and gas industry to increase production responsibly &#8212; already, the U.S. is producing 12.1 million barrels of oil per day and is on track to break records.</p>



<p>But I will also continue to insist – as I have with urgency recently – that reductions in the price of oil must produce lower gas prices for consumers at the pump.&nbsp; The price of oil is down about 20% since mid-June, but the price of gas has so far only fallen half as much.&nbsp;Oil and gas companies must not use this moment as an excuse for profiting by not passing along savings at the pump. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Second, I will urge Congress to act, this month, on legislation to reduce the cost of everyday expenses that are hitting American families, from prescription drugs to utility bills to health insurance premiums and to make more in America.</p>



<p>Third, I will continue to oppose any efforts by Republicans – as they have proposed during this campaign year &#8212; to make things worse by raising taxes on working people, or putting Social Security and Medicare on the chopping block every five years.</p>



<p>Finally, I will continue to give the Federal Reserve the room it needs to help it combat inflation.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Aboard Air Force One<br>En Route Tel Aviv, Israel</p>



<p>1:22 P.M. IDT</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Hello.&nbsp; Hi, everybody.&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; I just have a quick domestic thing that I want to hit with you guys.&nbsp; So, later today, in D.C., there will be a classified briefing in the Senate to talk about the national security stakes for the Bipartisan Innovation Act, and the stakes are very high.</p>



<p>The classified briefing will be held by Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo, Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks, and Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As Jake said in the briefing room earlier this week, our national security requires a secure and resilient supply chain.&nbsp; We must invest in semiconductor manufacturing in the United States to compete with China, get Javelins to Ukraine, and so much more.&nbsp; There is a pathway for the Bipartisan Innovation Act with strong bipartisan majority.&nbsp; It&#8217;s now or never, and no one should play politics with our national security.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And with that, I welcome you guys on our trip to the Middle East.&nbsp; And as you see, Jake Sullivan, our National Security Advisor, is here to talk about our first &#8212; our first stop into Israel.</p>



<p>Jake, all yours.</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; Thanks, guys.&nbsp; So, a couple of hours from now, we&#8217;ll land in Israel, and the President is very much looking forward to his first trip to Israel as President.&nbsp; Obviously, this is not his first trip to Israel as Joe Biden; it will, in fact, be the 10th time he has come.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And his strong support and commitment to the state of Israel and to the U.S.-Israel relationship is widely known both in Israel and in the United States.&nbsp; And this trip will be an opportunity for him to reaffirm and reinforce that as President of the United States.&nbsp; He believes that it is important at this critical moment in the world &#8212; with the turbulence we are facing; at a period of geopolitical competition; at a time when there are significant challenges that we are confronting from climate and energy, to food, to nuclear proliferation &#8212; that we deepen and intensify our engagement and relationship with our closest allies and partners in the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That was true in the Indo-Pacific, it&#8217;s true in Europe, and now it will be true here in Israel with a longstanding partner not just in security but across the full range of the relationship.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The first thing that will happen is an arrival ceremony.&nbsp; He will give remarks where we &#8212; he will have the opportunity to lay out, in his own voice, his vision for the U.S.-Israel relationship and his strong and ironclad commitment to Israel&#8217;s security and Israel&#8217;s future as a democratic and Jewish state.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He will then have the opportunity to engage in a briefing on both the state of play with Iron Dome, which the U.S. has supported strongly over the years and which the Biden administration, working with Congress, has supported to the tune of $1 billion just in the past year alone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That briefing also will cover a new laser-enabled missile defense system called Iron Beam, which is in development now and which will involve a partnership between the United States and Israel, just as Iron Dome did, where our two countries working together can take us to the next generation of missile defense technologies that help defeat threats coming from both state and non-state actors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After the briefing on Iron Dome and Iron Beam, he will go to Yad Vashem and have the opportunity to pay his respects at the Holocaust Memorial.&nbsp; It is something he has done before.&nbsp; But he feels very strongly that, as President, it&#8217;s important for him to visit Yad Vashem to reflect upon and remember this immense human tragedy of the Holocaust.&nbsp; And he will also have the chance there to meet with Holocaust survivors.&nbsp; That will complete his program for today.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And tomorrow, he will engage in a bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Lapid.&nbsp; And they will cover the full range of subjects, from the U.S.-Israel security relationship, to regional issues, to cooperation on science and technology, including new announcements that we will have on engagement on various forms of emerging technology that the Biden administration and the government of Israel will work on together in the years ahead.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He&#8217;ll do a press conference.&nbsp; And he will also, in the context of that meeting with the Prime Minister, engage with the President of the United Arab Emirates and the Prime Minister of Israel for the first time at the summit level in a new format called “I2U2” &#8212; Israel, India, the United States, UAE.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And there will be a significant announcement around food security and agricultural technology, which is an area where all four countries can come together to help deal with an immediate crisis facing the entire world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He will then have the opportunity to meet with President Herzog, the President of Israel, as well as with former Prime Minister, member of the Knesset, Bibi Netanyahu.</p>



<p>As I said at the podium, the President &#8212; the American President traditionally meets with a range of figures across the Israeli government, reflecting that our relationship with Israel is not just about one person, one leader, it is about the state of Israel and about engaging across the political spectrum.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He&#8217;ll have a reception with other Israeli leaders so that he gets the chance to engage with a number of critical leaders and stakeholders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And then the President will drop into the opening ceremony of the Maccabiah Games, which brings together Jewish athletes from around the world, including from the United States, where we have a very strong delegation that is going to do very well at these games.&nbsp; And the President is going to get the opportunity to give them a pep talk as &#8212; as the games get underway.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So that’s the &#8212; that&#8217;s the game plan over the course of the next, oh, 36 hours.&nbsp; A lot &#8212; a lot of business to get done.&nbsp; The President is very much looking forward to it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And then we will have the opportunity to talk about the stops the following day in the West Bank, including an East Jerusalem hospital and with President Abbas, when we next &#8212; when we next get together to gaggle.</p>



<p>With that, I&#8217;ll take your questions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So by meeting with the &#8212; both the Israelis and the Palestinian leaders, is he hoping to take some steps toward resuming the peace process?</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; The President will make clear his longstanding commitment and his administration&#8217;s commitment to a two-state solution, which he believes is the best path to ensure a viable, democratic Jewish State of Israel and a Palestinian state where Palestinians can live in freedom and dignity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He is also mindful of the challenges that have existed for many years in terms of moving that peace process forward.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He was heartened by the recent steps, including the phone call between Prime Minister Lapid and President Abbas.&nbsp; There has not been contact between an Israeli prime minister and the president of the Palestinian Authority in several years before that call.&nbsp; That is a positive step &#8212; engagement between Defense Minister Gantz and Prime Minister &#8212; President Abu Mazen as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So these are steps he&#8217;d like to encourage both sides to build on, but he won&#8217;t be making formal proposals for the launch of some new peace initiative.&nbsp; What he will do is try to encourage both sides to find a pathway where, step by step, they move closer towards a vision that works for both Israelis and for Palestinians and for the region as a whole.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To follow up on that, Jake, is there going to be any kind of public statement from the President on Israeli settlements?</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; The President has been clear, the administration has been clear that we want to see steps that are helpful and advance the cause of a two-state solution.&nbsp; And we don&#8217;t want to see steps that set back or constrain the cause of a two-state solution.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And we&#8217;ve said that, from our perspective, a range of activities are of concern to us, whether it be incitement to violence or payment to terrorists’ families or settlements, demolitions, evictions.&nbsp; All of this will be on the agenda over the course of the next three days.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will there be any update on the reopening of the consulate in East Jerusalem?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; Our position is that we would like a consulate in East Jerusalem.&nbsp; Obviously, that requires engagement with the Israeli government.&nbsp; It requires engagement with the Palestinian leadership as well.&nbsp; And we will continue that engagement on this trip.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does the President brings &#8212; plan to bring up anything about Shireen Abu Akleh?&nbsp; There have been many people calling for him to center the issue, asking for prosecutions.&nbsp; What&#8217;s his stance on that?</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; Secretary Blinken actually spoke with Shireen’s family a short while ago.&nbsp; He has invited the family to the United States to be able to sit down and engage with them directly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The administration, at the President&#8217;s direction, has been very much engaged in helping try to determine what exactly happened around the tragic circumstances of her death.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And we put out a statement on July 4th that indicated, one, that we do believe that it is most likely that her death was caused by an IDF soldier; and, two, that we don&#8217;t have reason to believe that it was intentional; and three, that there will have to be efforts made and accountability and making sure that we find a way to conclude this chapter justly.</p>



<p>This is someone who is a journalist, an American citizen.&nbsp; The President, Secretary of State, the entire team grieves for the family.&nbsp; It is a horrific tragedy, and we will continue to work and engage deeply on it.&nbsp; And, of course, this subject will be one of the subjects at play in this visit.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And just to pick up on the press freedom issue, Jake, a U.S. judge has given the administration until August 1st for the administration to weigh in on the MBS &#8212; whether MBS should be given immunity in a lawsuit by Khashoggi’s fiancée.&nbsp; Has the President decided on that, or is he waiting until after the trip?</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; So I would have to refer you to DOJ, which is engaged in the litigation in that case, in terms of the litigation posture that they would take.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jake, can I follow up on a couple of things you said on energy in the briefing yesterday, or the day before?&nbsp;</p>



<p>You said there was additional capacity in the Gulf to pump oil.&nbsp; I&#8217;m wondering: To what extent are you worried that eating through that buffer could pose a risk?</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; Sorry, it’s a little hard for me to hear you.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; You said yesterday there was additional capacity in the Gulf for oil production.&nbsp; What &#8212; to what extent are you guys worried that eating through that buffer could pose a risk in and of itself?&nbsp;</p>



<p>And then, you also mentioned the kind of gas caps plan that you&#8217;ve been working on at the G7.&nbsp; Can you update how China and India have responded to that plan and where those negotiations are?</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; On the first piece, our position when it comes to energy security, particularly in respect to the Gulf but globally, is that we want to see an adequate supply of energy on the market to ensure that we&#8217;re sustaining strong economic performance and that we are not unduly burdening customers at the pump.&nbsp; And we also want that energy supply to be sustainable over time, meaning having spare capacity as a part of the equation.</p>



<p>Those basic elements remain the touchstone of our policy.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re in constant contact not just with producers in the Gulf, but producers globally.&nbsp; We&#8217;re also working, obviously, on domestic production as well.&nbsp; And those conversations will continue during this trip.&nbsp; They &#8212; you know, the President talked about energy security in Asia, he talked about energy security in Europe.&nbsp; He&#8217;ll talk about energy security here.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And we believe that there &#8212; these conversations have taken a very constructive turn.&nbsp; And we will continue to apply the same kind of principles, approaches, and logic to the question of inadequate supply of energy that we have over the course of many years through multiple administrations.</p>



<p>On the issue of the price cap, there are detailed discussions unfolding, particularly between the European Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States, with respect to the modalities of this, the specifics of this, how this would work.&nbsp; And that will continue to get refined.&nbsp; That is not a process that will be completed in days; it will take time because of the number of elements that have to be worked through.</p>



<p>We are already now engaging with a number of the key consuming countries, including the countries you mentioned and others as well.&nbsp; And those are themselves detailed discussions, but because of their sensitivity, I don&#8217;t want to read them out here.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I will just say that we are being transparent, direct, and straightforward with the major consuming countries about our intent to work to reduce Russian revenues while at the same time to try to minimize disruption to the global economy and to consumers in all of these various countries, including consumers in the United States.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jake, there has been reports that President Biden won&#8217;t be shaking hands on this trip.&nbsp; What is the basis of that protocol, given that COVID is largely spread via airborne?</p>



<p><br>MR SULLIVAN:&nbsp; So you guys have seen, over the course of the past year and a half, as we&#8217;ve been in different stages of this pandemic, we have taken different approaches to both the question of masking and the question of contact &#8212; physical contact.&nbsp;<br><br>You&#8217;ve seen that play out on the course of foreign trips, how leaders physically interact with one another.&nbsp; That&#8217;s changed over time.&nbsp; It&#8217;s had different iterations, different manifestations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All I will say is that we&#8217;re in a phase of the pandemic now where we are seeking to reduce contact and to increase masking, as we&#8217;re standing here masked before you, to minimize spread.<br><br>But, you know, I can&#8217;t speak to, you know, every moment and every interaction and every movement.&nbsp; That&#8217;s just kind of the general principle we&#8217;re applying here.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words, there could be handshakes, but it&#8217;s not recommended?&nbsp; Help me &#8212;<br><br><br></p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; I think just the simplest way for me to put it is that we&#8217;re in a phase of the pandemic right now where we&#8217;re looking to increase masking, reduce contact to minimize spread.&nbsp; That&#8217;s the approach we&#8217;re taking.&nbsp; How exactly that plays out in any given interaction is something that we will see unfold.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jake, will there be a press conference when we&#8217;re in Saudi Arabia?&nbsp; Will the President speak to the press when he&#8217;s there?<br><br>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; I&#8217;ll defer to my colleagues in terms of the formalities of his engagement with the press.&nbsp; But we do expect that he will have some way of communicating with you guys while he&#8217;s there.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know about a formal press conference.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will we see him with Saudi leaders?&nbsp; Will we see him with MBS?<br><br>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; I&#8217;m going to, again, defer the question of what exactly the arrangements are in terms of press pools and press access and all of that to my friends on the communications team.<br><br>I will say that, from the United States’ perspective, it&#8217;s important that we have transparency and that you get as much access as possible to see the full range of engagements that occur there.<br><br>We&#8217;re not &#8212; we’re &#8212; we, the United States, are not going to seek to limit anybody or anything from anything.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you detail what some of those engagement &#8212; we&#8217;ve got no &#8212;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We’ve got nothing.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; nothing on what the schedule will be in Saudi.&nbsp; Can you run through some of what &#8212;<br><br>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; So, as I said at the podium a couple of days ago, we&#8217;ll have a bilateral program with the Saudis on Friday night.&nbsp; That program will involve the King, the Crown Prince, other ministers in the Saudi government.&nbsp; Then on Saturday, we will have bilateral meetings with a number of other key leaders from the region before we roll into the full summit.<br><br>And then in terms of more details on exactly how those meetings will be sequenced and stacked, you know, let&#8217;s get through the Israel piece, and then we&#8217;ll be in a position to lay out for you in full each of the elements of the Saudi stop.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But can you just give us a preview or like the broad overall theme of the President&#8217;s remarks at the GCC+3 Summit?&nbsp; Is he going to be returning to the “autocracies versus democracies” theme, or is he on to something else?<br><br>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; The President is going to give a broad, strong vision statement and strategy for the Biden administration&#8217;s approach to the Middle East at a consequential moment.&nbsp; And he will talk about security.&nbsp; He&#8217;ll talk about economics.&nbsp; He&#8217;ll talk about America&#8217;s historic role in the region and his commitment to maintain strong American leadership in the Middle East going forward on a basis that is appropriate for 2022 rather than 2002.&nbsp; And he will also talk about human rights.<br><br>But I really want to give him the opportunity to lay out that full case, which he will do at the table with the other leaders.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jake, on the President&#8217;s meeting with Prime &#8212; former Prime Minister Netanyahu, it&#8217;s no secret that Biden and Bibi haven&#8217;t always seen eye to eye, especially on the issue of Iran.&nbsp; What are the expectations of this meeting?&nbsp; And how does the current political turmoil in Israel not impact the President&#8217;s long-term goals?<br><br>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; Fundamentally, one of the key messages that we&#8217;re sending on this trip at this time is that the relationship between the United States and Israel is not about who sits in what chair in Israel or in the United States.&nbsp; It is about a relationship between two countries and two peoples.<br><br>And so, despite the fact that Israel has entered election season, the President can have an equally robust engagement with the Israeli government and the Israeli public as he could if we were not in election season.&nbsp; That’s point one.<br><br>Point two is that the President believes it is very important to show engagement across the Israeli political spectrum because, like the United States, Israel is a democracy where people have different points of view, where you have leaders representing different points of view, and he wants to engage with them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And then, third, he&#8217;s got a very long relationship with Bibi Netanyahu.&nbsp; It has always been a straightforward relationship.&nbsp; The two men have talked candidly about issues where they see eye to eye and many issues where they do not see eye to eye.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This meeting will be no different, but the President emerges from those meetings feeling that he&#8217;s represented his perspective effectively and gotten former Prime Minister Netanyahu’s perspective.&nbsp; And in that way, these are constructive and productive meetings, and we expect nothing different tomorrow.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jake, can you give us an update of the FSO supertanker that&#8217;s, you know, in danger of sinking or exploding in the Red Sea?&nbsp; Will the President be discussing this matter to raise funds to potentially &#8212; to potentially avoid an environmental disaster there without Gulf leaders?</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; This is something we&#8217;ve been focused on for quite some time.&nbsp; Obviously, the Houthis have considerable responsibility to ensure that a solution can be facilitated and executed.</p>



<p>I can&#8217;t say for certain that the President will engage on this at the table with the Gulf leaders in detail, but it is something he has directed his team to work on actively so that we can avoid an environmental catastrophe.&nbsp; And our team has been very much deeply engaged with the key countries in the region to try to make progress on it, as well as with the United Nations and others.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jake, what&#8217;s the President going to tell Israeli leaders about his efforts to resume the nuclear deal &#8212; the Iran nuclear deal?</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; He&#8217;s going to be straightforward about it the way he has been publicly and the way that we have been in our diplomatic engagements in the region.&nbsp; There is a deal on the table; it involves a mutual compliance-for-compliance return to the JCPOA.&nbsp; The President believes Iran should take it.</p>



<p>At the same time, we are not holding back in terms of enforcing the sanctions.&nbsp; We have done two rounds of designations over the course of the last few weeks to crack down on smuggling and to increase the economic pressure on Iran.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So the President&#8217;s policy has been clear and straightforward, and that&#8217;s how he&#8217;s going to lay it out for countries in the region, some of whom have different perspectives, obviously, including Israel.&nbsp; And he will make the case that from the view of the United States and the Biden administration, diplomacy is the best way to reach what is a shared goal of ensuring that Iran never gets a nuclear weapon.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jake, currently it does not look like the Saudis are about to make major commitments on human rights or energy.&nbsp; Are you concerned that the President could conclude this trip and return to the states relatively empty-handed?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; I do not believe that the President &#8212; well, let me step back.&nbsp; I have confidence that after the President has the opportunity to engage with the Saudi leadership and with his Gulf partners, he will be able to demonstrate material progress to the American people in terms of the things that matter to them and for regional peace and security.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m not going to get ahead of what he will say on the trip, but he is coming with the intention of having productive, constructive discussions that lead to material progress on a range of different fronts.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How would you gauge “material progress”?</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; I mean, it&#8217;s a bit of an existential question, I guess.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean on &#8212; on human rights, for example, what would be “material progress”?&nbsp; What would you want to see from them?</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; Well, first, I think &#8212; one thing that I have to say has been interesting to me is the way that there has been a relative glossing over of what has happened on the ground in Yemen, which we regard is a massive human rights issue &#8212; because you&#8217;re talking about trying to avoid the death, destruction, and suffering of millions &#8212; tens of millions.</p>



<p>And a part of the context for this trip &#8212; what has already been accomplished in moving into this trip has been the product of intensive diplomacy.&nbsp; And that is a fragile but real ceasefire &#8212; that is now in its third month that the Saudis have invested in and, we believe, on this trip will demonstrate a further commitment to &#8212; and that has saved a significant number of lives and improved a significant number of lives in Yemen.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s been interesting that this was the top issue for many people with respect to the U.S.-Saudi relationship.&nbsp; And now that there is a ceasefire in place, there&#8217;s a kind of sense of, “Well, okay, let&#8217;s just put that thing on the back burner.”</p>



<p>We do not believe we can put that issue on the back burner because that ceasefire is fragile.&nbsp; It needs to be protected.&nbsp; It needs to be nurtured.&nbsp; It needs to be built upon.&nbsp; And continued progress on Yemen alone, if there were nothing else, would be a significant achievement with both important consequences for regional stability and, even more important, massive human &#8212; positive human consequences.&nbsp; So that&#8217;s just one thing that I would reinforce.</p>



<p>You said there&#8217;ll be no progress on energy, no progress on other things.&nbsp; I &#8212; you know, I would take issue with those characterizations at this point, but I&#8217;m not going to get ahead of what happens both on this trip and in the weeks that follow.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jake, right before we left, the State Department acknowledged that at least three Americans have been detained in Venezuela.&nbsp; I’m wondering if you could talk about the President&#8217;s engagement or your engagement on trying to get those guys home.</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; Look, the President has made it a personal priority to try to get unjustly detained Americans and hostages home.&nbsp; You&#8217;ve obviously seen him talking to the families of unjustly detained Americans in Russia.</p>



<p>The Secretary of State and I &#8212; not a week goes by where one or both of us isn&#8217;t working directly with families, talking directly with families to consult on a way forward to get folks home.</p>



<p>We have efforts in train with the government of Russia, the government &#8212; the regime in Venezuela, the government in Iran. &nbsp;We are engaging the Taliban.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What about the Saudis?&nbsp; What about American citizens and residents in Saudi?</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; Let me just finish the answer to the question he posed.</p>



<p>To try to find a resolution that gets the government of China and everywhere where there are American citizens who are currently detained, to get them released and get them home.&nbsp; And we will continue to try to make progress.</p>



<p>Venezuela, specifically, we made a first step that was really important.&nbsp; We did get a couple of Americans out, and that was a great thing.&nbsp; But it was bittersweet because there&#8217;s a lot of Americans still there, and we&#8217;ve got to get them home.</p>



<p>With respect to the Saudis: When we came into office, there were three American citizens detained in Saudi prisons.&nbsp; The President directed his team to work that.&nbsp; All three of those citizens were released from prison.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re continuing to work to try to remove the remaining restrictions on them.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jake, going back to Iran quickly: On the sending drones to Russia that you warned was a possibility on Monday at the briefing, what&#8217;s the evidence on this?&nbsp; Has Iran done it, or is the U.S. warning that this is in the works?&nbsp; And is Putin&#8217;s visit to Iran related to this?</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; I can&#8217;t speak to what is driving Putin&#8217;s visit to Iran, but the timing surely is interesting.</p>



<p>As far as what the evidence is, I can&#8217;t speak further with respect to sources and methods.&nbsp; I would point out that when we have laid out information related to Russia&#8217;s war effort in Ukraine and Russia&#8217;s engagement with other countries, it has borne out on a regular basis.&nbsp; And I think &#8212; I can understand the frustration of us saying things and then saying we can&#8217;t say more.&nbsp; But I think over the course of months, we’ve built up a pattern in which we do not lightly come before you and lay out information if we do not have confidence in what we are saying.</p>



<p>As I said at the briefing, we have not seen evidence of delivery, but we have seen evidence of engagement between the two countries on this specific issue of large numbers of UAVs, including weapons-enabled UAVs for Russia to acquire from Iran.</p>



<p>And we think that this is of interest, to put it mildly, to the countries we will be visiting on this trip.&nbsp; Because Russia deepening an alliance with Iran to kill Ukrainians is something that the whole world should look at and see as a profound threat but a particularly acute threat to countries in the region since these same kinds of UAVs are the UAVs that were destroying infrastructure and killing people in both Saudi Arabia and other countries in the Middle East.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jake, can you tell us anything about the identity of the ISIS leader in Syria that was killed, beyond his nom de guerre?</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; So, I confess that I cannot tell you more &#8212; not because, you know, we&#8217;re trying to withhold information but because, standing here right now, I&#8217;m not sure what DOD has cleared for release.&nbsp; That&#8217;s just me being totally honest.</p>



<p>But what I will endeavor to do is consult with them and get you as much information as we can provide, given, you know, obviously, the sensitivity of the issue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What I can say is that he was one of the top ISIS leaders &#8212; operationally significant, very much relevant to the efforts ISIS was undertaking in Syria.&nbsp; And so, we believe the strike actually deals a real blow to ISIS’s efforts.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jake, maybe I misheard earlier, but on I2U2, is Modi participating in that?</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN: &nbsp;Yes.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And what is the goal of bringing India into so many issues, right?&nbsp; That seems to be an ongoing theme.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve got IPEF, the Quad, now I2U2.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; What are you trying to achieve</p>



<p>with that?</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; So, first, India plays a critical role in the Indo-Pacific.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s one of the largest, most significant, most strategically consequential countries in the Indo-Pacific, and so it should play a central role in our strategy, including through the Quad.</p>



<p>India also has very longstanding ties to and engagement in the Middle East, and relationships not just with the Gulf countries but relationships &#8212; a relationship over the years with Israel.&nbsp; And so just as the United States can play a critical and central role in helping deepen Israel&#8217;s integration into the region, India has a role to play in that as well.</p>



<p>So bringing together Israel, India, and the United Arab Emirates, especially around an issue where the four countries have unique capacities to bring to bear on agricultural technology, leading to greater food production, leading to an alleviation of the food security challenge &#8212; this is the kind of thing that really fulfills the President&#8217;s vision of a more integrated, more globally engaged Middle East across the board that isn&#8217;t just focused on issues that have been top of mind for American foreign policymakers over the last 20 years &#8212; terrorism and wars.&nbsp; This is a different kind of approach, and it&#8217;s about expanding partnerships, expanding the geography rather than contracting or narrowing it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so we very much look forward to Prime Minister Modi&#8217;s participation in this event.&nbsp; And we think I2U2 can become a feature of the broader region, just as the Quad has become a central pillar of the Indo-Pacific strategy of the United States.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jake, New York City yesterday released this PSA about what to do in case of a nuclear attack, and it got a lot of coverage.&nbsp; I&#8217;m wondering: Is that just the media kind of jumping on a routine thing that happens, or have you guys seen some sort of intelligence that you&#8217;ve shared with city, state, and local officials of a heightened risk of nuclear attack right now?</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; I do not believe that it was the result of any intelligence-sharing from the federal government to New York City that led to this.&nbsp; I can&#8217;t speak as to why they put it out at this point.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jake, I have a question from a member of the radio pool.&nbsp; What is the White House&#8217;s response on the expected absence of Saudi Arabia from a groundbreaking ceremony for the new Desert Shield and Desert Storm Memorial on Thursday at the National Mall?</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; We’ll have to get back to you on that.&nbsp; I was not tracking the groundbreaking ceremony participation issue &#8212; who&#8217;s coming, who&#8217;s not coming.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All right.&nbsp; Thank you, Jake.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Thanks, guys.</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; All right, guys.&nbsp; I just have one &#8212; one additional thing that I wanted to address because it came up in the &#8212; in our briefing on Monday, and it&#8217;s about the Yosemite wildfires.&nbsp; So I just want to share some stuff that we&#8217;re doing.</p>



<p>So we&#8217;re closely monitoring the Yosemite wildfire, and the President has been briefed.&nbsp; As always, we are grateful for the brave and swift work of federal, state, and local first responders.&nbsp; Together with state and local partners, the Department of Interior is deploying significant air and ground resources to reduce the intensity of the fire, limit spread, and contain spot fires.&nbsp; We also know the impacts of extreme weather are making wildfires more intense, and no one is immune from climate change.&nbsp; That is why the President has continued to tackling &#8212; to making tackling the climate crisis one of his top priorities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so the Department of Interior is the &#8212; is the place to go on any other specifics and details you all may have.&nbsp; So just wanted to touch on that.</p>



<p>And another thing I just wanted to touch on as well, as you all were asking Jake about the COVID protocols &#8212; so I just wanted to say, like: Look, the President takes a range of COVID precautions and additional ones when he travels.&nbsp; You heard from the COVID team yesterday, when they &#8212; they talked through how they are &#8212; the preparations that they are taking with BA.4 and for BA.5, which is now the majority of cases in the United States.&nbsp; We are always monitoring what&#8217;s going on in the countries, and so we are prepared for this.&nbsp; But we are also &#8212; always on these trips, we take precautions.&nbsp; And &#8212; and so, for us, this is not abnormal. &nbsp;These precautions that we take are decisions made by the President&#8217;s doctor.</p>



<p>I will add: Ahead of this flight, the President tested negative for COVID, and he will test during the trip.&nbsp; And we are closely, again, monitoring BA.5.&nbsp; It&#8217;s reasonable to expect him to take some additional precautions.&nbsp; And so I just wanted to put that out there for you all to know.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karine, are you increasing the cadence of the testing?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have anything more to change.&nbsp; As you know, when he travels, there are &#8212; there are protocols that countries have that we adhere to, that all of you and myself have to adhere to in order to visit that &#8212; that host country.&nbsp; But wanted to just have some &#8212; give you guys some transparency on that.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you just clarify: Is there a new policy around shaking hands or not?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Well, what I&#8217;m &#8212; what we&#8217;re saying is we are taking precautions.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is one of those precautions not shaking hands?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp;&nbsp; What I&#8217;m saying is we&#8217;re going to try to minimize &#8212; we&#8217;re trying to minimize contact as much as possible where &#8212; where we can.&nbsp; And so that is what the focus is going to be on this trip.&nbsp; And &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karine &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; the President was in very lengthy handshaking, selfie sessions the last two days at the White House.&nbsp; So is this a brand-new policy as of today that we&#8217;re tr- &#8212; that you guys are trying to reduce contact?<a></a></p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  This has nothing to do with a brand new policy.  What we&#8217;re saying is we tend to take extra precautions.  While &#8212; while COVID is not gone, it&#8217;s still very much around.  And so while we &#8212; we&#8217;ve talked about BA.4, we’ve talked about BA.5, especially as it relates to the COVID briefing, as the COVID team laid out.  And so we are taking extra precautions.<br><br>BA.4, BA.5 is now the majority of cases that we&#8217;re seeing in the United States.  We&#8217;re always monitoring what&#8217;s going on in the country.<br><br>Again, this is up to his doctor as we&#8217;re seeing what&#8217;s happening across the (inaudible).<br><br>Q    I mean, I think we&#8217;re dancing around this question, which is: There&#8217;s reason why the President might not want to be seen shaking hands with the Crown Prince, and it seems like you&#8217;ve &#8212; like he was just on the South Lawn of the White House embracing members of Congress, all that sort of thing.  And now, suddenly, there&#8217;s what appears to be a change.  And so I just want to give you a chance to &#8212;<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Well, I mean &#8212; no, no, no.  There’s &#8212; I wouldn&#8217;t say there&#8217;s a change.  And here&#8217;s the thing &#8212; that&#8217;s why you&#8217;re asking me if he&#8217;s going to shake hands or not.  We are saying that we&#8217;re going to try to minimize contact as much as possible.  But also, there are precautions that we are taking because this is up to his doctor. <br><br>BA.4, BA.5 is indeed, as we&#8217;re seeing, increasing.  And we want to make sure that we&#8217;re taking those precautions to keep him safe and to keep all of us safe.  And that&#8217;s &#8212; you know, and we just want to be very clear on that.<br><br>Q    Karine, Jake deferred some of the questions on press access in Saudi to you.<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.  Yeah.<br><br>Q    Will you commit to the President having a press conference while he&#8217;s in Saudi Arabia?<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, right now &#8212; right now I can say that we &#8212; we’re not &#8212; we don&#8217;t have a &#8212; a press conference for Saudi, but what we are trying to do is trying to make sure that you guys hear from the President in Saudi on &#8212; on the bilat, on the trip, and make sure that you guys hear directly from him.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why won’t there be a press conference?&nbsp; And what does that say about his commitment to press access and the free press?<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; I have to tell you, I mean, if you’re &#8212; if we &#8212; well, if we are going to make sure that you guys hear from him, that is press access.&nbsp; I don’t &#8212; I &#8212; I disagree with the characterization of your question.&nbsp; We are &#8212; we are right now working to make sure that there is press a- &#8212; press access, that you actually hear from him directly.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But would this be him by himself, as opposed to him with the Crown Prince?<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; I&#8217;m not going to get into specifics.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not going to get ahead of &#8212; ahead of what that&#8217;s going to look like.&nbsp; We are working, on our side, to make sure that you guys hear directly from him, because we want you to have access and to hear from the President on this trip.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And will there be press access to the bilats?&nbsp; Will there be pool sprays?<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; That one &#8212; again, we&#8217;re working through that, and we will have more to share.&nbsp; Like, remember, we&#8217;re going to have another gaggle as we head out from Israel to Jeddah, so &#8212; Jerusalem, specifically, to Jeddah.&nbsp; So that &#8212; so, you will have &#8212; you will hear more from us about Saudi Arabia.&nbsp;<br><br>So, clearly, we want to make sure &#8212; and this is what Jake said; this is important to us &#8212; we want to make sure there&#8217;s transparency. &nbsp;We want to make sure there&#8217;s access.<br><br>I don&#8217;t think having a formal press conference is the only way to go.&nbsp; I think hearing from the President, hearing directly from him, which is what we are working to &#8212; towards, making sure that happens and that you guys have that opportunity to hear how &#8212; what &#8212; how &#8212; what he thinks and how the conversations went and more broadly how the trip went.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just to be clear, Karine: So, at this point, you&#8217;re saying that you are not sure whether pool will have access to the bilat between the President and the Saudi leadership?<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; I’m saying that we will have more to share in the next day or so.&nbsp; That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m saying.</p>



<p>Q    Karine, will we hear from the President about the &#8212; you &#8212; you previewed the inflation numbers, that it would likely be high today.  I don&#8217;t &#8212; I&#8217;m just curious if we&#8217;re going to hear from the President or if you maybe &#8212; it still seems too early for the data to have come out back home.<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  (Inaudible.)  So, as we know &#8212; as you just stated, Justin, the data is &#8212; we haven&#8217;t seen the data yet.  I pre- &#8212; we did a little bit of a preview on Monday in the briefing room.  It&#8217;ll be out at 8:30 Eastern.<br><br>Again, we &#8212; we expect the backwards-looking inflation data to be highly elevated, mainly because gas prices were so high in June.<br><br>The good news is that energy prices have come down substantially this month and are expected to fall further.  Just some data here: The average retail price of gas was 11 percent higher in June than it was in May.  And the cost of gas in July is already down 7 percent from June peak and down 5 percent on average.  And even though gas prices shot up quickly when oil prices rose, they have not come down as quickly as oil &#8212; oil has.<br><br>We continue to call on oil and gas companies to pass on their lower costs to consumers.  American families should not be the first to pay and the last to benefit.<br><br>Again, the numbers are not out yet.  But this is what we have &#8212; we have been predicting and laying out for you all and our expectations.<br><br>Q    Karine, one question on Ukraine.  It&#8217;s been past 60 days since the President signed the Lend-Lease Act.  So, by law, the administration should already be coming out with a mechanism or a procedure in terms of expediting the lending and leasing of weapons to Ukraine.  Why hasn&#8217;t the administration come out with that?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; I want to make sure I get &#8212; I get you an answer here, so let me connect with our team and make sure that we have an answer on that particular question.</p>



<p>Anything else?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All right.&nbsp; Thank you.<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; All right.&nbsp; Thanks, guys.<br><br></p>

<p>NATIONAL SECURITY MEMORANDUM/NSM-12</p>



<p>MEMORANDUM FOR THE VICE PRESIDENT<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE SECRETARY OF STATE<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE ATTORNEY GENERAL<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE SECRETARY OF COMMERCE<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE SECRETARY OF ENERGY<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BUDGET<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE UNITED STATES PERMANENT REPRESENTATIVE TO THE UNITED NATIONS<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE DIRECTOR OF THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AGENCY<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE DIRECTOR OF THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;INVESTIGATION</p>



<p>SUBJECT:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The President&#8217;s Intelligence Priorities</p>



<p>The collection and analysis of timely and accurate intelligence is essential to our national security, foreign policy, law enforcement, and defense, and is critical to protecting and advancing the United States&#8217; vital interests.&nbsp; Global challenges posed by nation states and transnational threats alike demand the Intelligence Community (IC) use its resources in a coordinated manner that aligns with and is responsive to the&nbsp;President&#8217;s overall priorities and direction.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 1.&nbsp; President&#8217;s Intelligence Priorities. &nbsp;The President&#8217;s Intelligence Priorities (PIP) will continue to serve&nbsp;as the President&#8217;s primary mechanism for identifying and providing guidance to the IC on the intelligence topics and issues of highest importance.&nbsp; The PIP should inform the IC&#8217;s budgetary, personnel, and other resource allocations to ensure collection and analysis of intelligence that provides insights, warning, or other illuminating information on the priorities contained therein.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sec. 2.&nbsp; Process.&nbsp; Due to the evolving nature of the challenges we face as a Nation, I direct the following process to govern the development and execution of the PIP and ensure that it remains current and instructive:</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a)&nbsp; The National Security Council (NSC) Deputies Committee, as described in NSM-2 or a successor directive, shall convene not less than every 2 years to update the PIP and recommend its approval by the President.&nbsp; Should there be a lack of consensus among the Deputies, the NSC Principals Committee shall review the PIP and recommend its approval by the President.&nbsp; Any lack of consensus among the NSC Principals Committee shall be&nbsp;presented to the President for decision.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b)&nbsp; The NSC staff will facilitate this review through a Restricted Interagency Policy Committee process, as necessary.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c)&nbsp; The Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), in close consultation with NSC staff, shall further establish and manage a robust National Intelligence Priorities Framework (NIPF) process which responds to the PIP and ensures that both the IC and additional departments and agencies that require intelligence are represented in the process of developing priorities.&nbsp; The ODNI shall also evaluate, on an ongoing basis, the IC&#8217;s responsiveness to the designated priorities within the PIP.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (d)&nbsp; The Director of National Intelligence (DNI) shall work&nbsp;with&nbsp;IC department and agency heads to ensure proper implementation of the PIP so that the President, through the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs (APNSA), is adequately informed of any challenges related to implementation.&nbsp; In response to emerging threats or crisis events, the DNI, in consultation with the APNSA, may increase the priority of any item within the NIPF to a Priority 1 for period(s) not to exceed 180 days each.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sec. 3.&nbsp; Definition.&nbsp; As used in this memorandum, the term&nbsp;&#8220;Intelligence Community&#8221; has the meaning specified in the&nbsp;National Security Act of 1947, as amended, and Executive Order&nbsp;12333, as amended.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sec. 4.&nbsp; Revocation.&nbsp; This memorandum supersedes National Security Presidential Directive/NSPD-26, which is hereby revoked.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-right">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.</p>

<p>The United States and Mexico affirm our broad and deep cooperation and commitment to building a more prosperous and secure future for the people of North America.&nbsp; As we face unprecedented global and regional challenges that require the concerted efforts of both our nations, we uphold democracy, inclusive growth, transparency, rule of law, and human rights as core values that underpin our shared security and prosperity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The United States and Mexico, together with Canada, represent an economic powerhouse.&nbsp; The foundation of North American competitiveness is the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement and we reaffirm our commitment to its full implementation for the benefit of working families, including by fully upholding its labor provisions and actively collaborating with stakeholders in the private sector and civil society.&nbsp; Through active coordination of our economic policies, we will make our supply chains more resilient and expand production in North America.&nbsp; We look forward to working on this and other relevant issues at the 10<sup>th</sup> North American Leaders Summit (NALS), which will take place in Mexico at the end of the year.</p>



<p>Increasing inflation impacts the wellbeing of families in both our countries, and requires strong, immediate, and concerted action.&nbsp; That is why we have committed to jointly combat inflation by accelerating the facilitation of bilateral trade and reducing trade costs.&nbsp; The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement enhances the free flow of goods without barriers, which promotes innovation that boosts productivity and increases resilience, helping both countries fight inflation and supporting families.&nbsp; As part of joint efforts to improve food security, Mexico plans to purchase up to 20,000 tons of milk powder from the United States to assist Mexican families in rural and urban communities.&nbsp; In addition, Mexico will buy up to one million tons of fertilizer (ammonium sulfate) from the United States to distribute to subsistence farmers and continue to buy animal feed to assist small producers.</p>



<p><a></a>Borders that are more resilient, more efficient, and safer, will enhance our shared commerce.&nbsp; We are committed like never before to completing a multi-year joint U.S.-Mexico border infrastructure modernization effort for projects along the 2,000-mile border.&nbsp; The joint effort seeks to align priorities, unite border communities, and make the flow of commerce and people more secure and efficient.&nbsp; President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law includes $3.4 billion to undertake 26 major construction and modernization projects at land ports of entry on the northern and southern border.&nbsp; These land port modernization projects will create good-paying local jobs, bolster safety and security, and make the economy more resilient to supply chain challenges – all while serving as models for sustainability and innovation.&nbsp; Mexico has committed to invest $1.5 billion on border infrastructure between 2022 and 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a></a>The next U.S.-Mexico High Level Economic Dialogue (HLED) in September will focus on strengthening mechanisms to create more secure and efficient corridors for trade and commerce, foster an environment that encourages investment to help generate more and better jobs for our people in both countries.&nbsp; We confirm our efforts to create a more inclusive workforce that is better educated, more competitive, and better trained to meet the needs of the 21<sup>st</sup> Century economy. We reiterate our commitment to conduct outreach to understand stakeholder considerations to increase investment and bolster supply chain resilience, specifically on strategic sectors like semiconductors and information and communication technologies.&nbsp; We will focus our development efforts on climate solutions and the development of southern Mexico, with its vast human potential and important opportunities for commerce, conservation, and clean energy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Facing the shared challenges of climate change, we resolve to promote a business environment that advances a greener, cleaner North America, acknowledging the importance of investing in and promoting renewable sources of energy.&nbsp; We commit to tackle methane emissions from oil and gas and other sectors, accelerate the transition to zero-emission vehicles, and deepen our efforts to seek nature-based solutions, enabling our two countries to become global leaders in clean energies and actions to combat climate change.&nbsp; In support of the Global Methane Pledge and Global Methane Pledge Energy Pathway, Mexico and Pemex, in cooperation with the U.S., will develop an implementation plan to eliminate routine flaring and venting across onshore and offshore oil and gas operations and identify priority projects for investment.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><a></a>Through the Bicentennial Framework for Security, Public Health, and Safe Communities, we reaffirmed our commitment to work together to address major security issues affecting our nations, including the challenges of fentanyl, arms trafficking, and human smuggling, and to reduce levels of drug abuse and addiction.&nbsp; We committed to deepen our cooperation to combat transnational criminal organizations that foment violence in both our countries.&nbsp; We reaffirmed the robust operational efforts between law enforcement agencies to address these paramount security efforts.&nbsp; We pledged to establish a U.S.-Mexico operational task force to disrupt the flow of fentanyl into our countries.</p>



<p>Building on the commitments at the Summit of the Americas made by twenty-one countries in the hemisphere pursuant to the Los Angeles Declaration on Migration and Protection, we are taking immediate and coordinated steps to manage the flows of migrants arriving into our countries.&nbsp; We have joined efforts to address the underlying economic and security drivers of migration and, recognizing that development must be at the center of all migration policies, we will accelerate and expand international cooperation programs focused on the most marginalized communities. At the same time, we will maintain strong border enforcement policies while ensuring full protection of human rights.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a></a>The United States and Mexico reaffirmed our commitment to launch a bilateral working group on labor migration pathways and worker protections.&nbsp; We will work to promote greater worker protections as part of a labor mobility strategy for migrant workers who seek access to legal pathways. Mexico and the United States will also convene a working group to strengthen our cross-border response to child migration, a phenomenon that has significantly impacted both of our countries and puts youth in unnecessary peril.&nbsp; We also reaffirm our pledge to improve economic and social conditions throughout the region, creating dignified job opportunities as viable alternatives for potential migrants, and helping tackle the root causes of migration across the Americas.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The tragic deaths of migrants at the hands of human smugglers in San Antonio further strengthens our determination to go after the multi-billion-dollar criminal smuggling industry preying on migrants and increase our efforts to address the root causes of migration.  The Departments of Justice and Homeland Security and Mexico’s Attorney General’s Office have coordinated to arrest and prosecute those who endanger the lives of vulnerable migrants, including through the work of Joint Task Force Alpha and its Mexican partners.   This year our countries will celebrate 200 years of formal diplomatic relations.  As neighbors, friends, and family, we are united as two nations that share one future. </p>
