<p class="has-text-align-center">South Court Auditorium</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Eisenhower Executive Office Building</p>



<p>11:49 A.M. EST<br></p>



<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  Thank you, Marc, for that incredible introduction but also for your incredible dedication to public service.  The people of Washington, D.C. and our nation thank you for your dedication.</p>



<p>Well, good morning, everyone.&nbsp; Good morning.&nbsp; Today, we are joined by many leaders dedicated &#8212; who have always been dedicated &#8212; I know; I know you all &#8212; to improving the health and the wellbeing of all our communities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg, thank you for your leadership.&nbsp; Administrator of our Environmental Protection Agency, Michael Regan, thank you for your leadership.&nbsp; These two guys joined me yesterday.&nbsp; We were in Selma talking about the connection between these issues and what it means to fight for social justice and equality.</p>



<p>Administrator of our Federal Transit Administration, Nuria Fernandez, thank you for your leadership.</p>



<p>And to the members of Congress who are here: I see you when you are walking the halls of our Capitol, when you are there where the cameras are on and where the cameras are off.&nbsp; And you&#8217;re always fighting for these issues and for the people of our nation.&nbsp; So I want to thank you all for being here this morning.</p>



<p>And to our labor leaders and our community leaders, our environmental leaders: Thank you all.&nbsp; Because this truly is about a group effort.</p>



<p>So, it is a special pleasure, and particularly to be together this week: the one-year anniversary of the passage of the American Rescue Plan.&nbsp; And thank you, of course, to Gene Sperling, our American Rescue Plan Coordinator, and Mitch Landrieu, our administration&#8217;s Infrastructure Coordinator, who have done so much on behalf of our nation to make what we did in the halls of Congress hit the streets of America.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s all about.</p>



<p>So I&#8217;ll begin with a short story.&nbsp; When I was attorney general of California, I heard about a town called Mira Loma.&nbsp; And this town had some of the worst air pollution in the state.&nbsp; And I&#8217;d been hearing stories about the grandmothers and the grandfathers in particular, asking, shouting, pleading: “Will someone pay attention to what is happening in our community?”&nbsp; They were demanding action.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And this is a town of folks who work hard.&nbsp; They work hard.&nbsp; They are growing their families.&nbsp; It was a town where a lot of the folks were monolingual Spanish speaking, but were so dedicated &#8212; and were so dedicated to their community.</p>



<p>So, I went there.&nbsp; I went to go visit with them and to listen to them and to stand with them.&nbsp; And Mira Loma is a community not unlike communities around our nation &#8212; hardworking folks working hard jobs, just expecting, asking, righteously requiring that they be seen, that they be heard, and that their needs be taken seriously, and folks who are living in neighborhoods and communities across our country where they are in close proximity to large shipping warehouses or major highways.</p>



<p>In Mira Loma, every day, heavy-duty trucks made more than 15,000 trips to that town’s main roads, bringing with them, of course, soot and exhaust.&nbsp; And the air turned toxic.</p>



<p>The first time I went to Mira Loma, you could taste the metal in the air.&nbsp; My eyes burned.&nbsp; The toxicity in the air was that thick.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And studies, in fact, had shown &#8212; university studies had shown that children from Mira Loma were suffering from some of the poorest lung development of any communities in our state.&nbsp; People there told me that family members, relatives, friends were suffering from high rates of cancer, asthma, and heart disease.</p>



<p>And again, the fact is there are many Mira Lomas all over our country, communities that have been left out and left behind, and where pollution from heavy-duty trucks and buses has made the air poisonous to breathe.</p>



<p>And this pollution is also, of course, accelerating the climate crisis, threatening the future not just of our communities but of the entire world.&nbsp; And this is not how it has to be.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Imagine a future: The freight trucks that deliver bread and milk to our grocery store shelves and the buses that take children to school and parents to work; imagine all the heavy-duty vehicles that keep our supply lines strong and allow our economy to grow &#8212; imagine that they produced zero emissions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Well, you all imagined it.&nbsp; That’s why we’re here today &#8212; because we have the ability to see what can be, unburdened by what has been, and then to make the possible actually happen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, today, I am proud to announce that our administration is taking steps to build that better future by transforming our nation’s fleet of buses and trucks.&nbsp; And that transformation will begin with public buses.</p>



<p>This year, our Department of Transportation will make available nearly $1.5 billion &#8212; yes, Administrator Regan, with a “B” &#8212; (laughter) &#8212; in grants to help cities and towns electrify their fleet of public buses, build infrastructure to support their fleet, and train workers to run it.</p>



<p>These grants will make public transit more reliable and more affordable, which, of course, means shorter waits and more reliable commutes for folks who need to take public transit to get where they need to go.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These buses will be built in America.&nbsp; And these grants will also be used to train drivers and mechanics to operate, maintain, and repair this new technology.&nbsp; This investment will create good jobs &#8212; jobs of the future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And we are not stopping there.&nbsp; Through our Department of Transportation, today we are also allocating $2.2 billion in funding from the American Rescue Plan &#8212; thank you, Congress &#8212; to 35 transit agencies spread across 18 states.&nbsp; This funding will help communities employ more transit workers and keep transit services running.</p>



<p>In addition, as Administrator Regan shared, today our EPA is issuing a proposed rule that will significantly &#8212; significantly reduce dangerous emissions from all new heavy-duty trucks and buses.</p>



<p>And again, as the Administrator shared, we are also announcing funding for, yes, one of my favorite topics: electric school buses.&nbsp; Today&#8217;s $17 million in grants will complement the $5 billion for clean school buses that we secured &#8212; thank you again &#8212; in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our transportation sector has reached a turning point.&nbsp; We are all in the midst of a turning point.&nbsp; We have the technology to transition to a zero-emission fleet.&nbsp; Our administration &#8212; together, all of us &#8212; is working to make that possibility a reality.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We can clean our air and protect the health of our children.&nbsp; We can connect all of our communities with affordable, accessible, and reliable public transportation.&nbsp; We can address the climate crisis and grow our economy at the same time.</p>



<p>And I am here today to say: Together, we all are doing just that.&nbsp; With the help of the American people, we are building a better future for all who call our dear country home.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thank you all very much.  Thank you.  (Applause.) </p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>During Week of Anniversary of American Rescue Plan, Biden-Harris Administration Highlights Investments in Community Colleges, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and Other Critical Institutions</em></p>



<p>Today, the Department of Education announced state-by-state breakdown of funding for colleges and universities provided in the President’s American Rescue Plan – one of the largest one-time infusions of funding ever provided to the nation’s colleges and universities. These funds were provided through the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund (HEERF) over the past year.</p>



<p>The American Rescue Plan provided:</p>



<ul><li>More than $10 billion to over 1,000 community colleges</li><li>More than $2.7 billion to Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs)</li><li>More than $190 million to Tribally Controlled Colleges and Universities (TCCUs)</li><li>Approximately $11 billion to Hispanic-serving institutions (HSIs)</li><li>Approximately $5 billion to Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander-serving institutions (AANAPISIs)</li><li>Almost $1 billion to Predominantly Black Institutions (PBIs)</li></ul>



<p><strong>The Department of Education expects at least half of these funds will be used to provide direct financial relief to students.</strong> In addition to funding provided under previous coronavirus relief legislation, these funds are already being used by colleges and universities across the country to serve students and ensure learning continues during the COVID-19 pandemic. These funds are already having a significant impact on institutions and students:</p>



<ul><li>A <a href="https://www.acenet.edu/Research-Insights/Pages/Senior-Leaders/Presidents-Survey-HEERF.aspx">recent survey of college presidents by the American Council on Education</a> found HEERF enabled:<ul><li><strong><u>93% of colleges to provide direct financial support</u></strong> to students at risk of dropping out</li></ul><ul><li><strong><u>81% of colleges to keep student net prices similar to pre-pandemic levels</u></strong></li></ul><ul><li><strong><u>70% of colleges to continue to employ faculty, staff, and other employees</u></strong> otherwise at risk of unemployment</li></ul><ul><li><strong><u>63% of colleges to keep students and faculty safe</u></strong> by purchasing COVID-19 tests, health screenings, and health care</li></ul></li><li>Thousands of colleges and universities all across the country are <strong><u>using HEERF to keep students enrolled and on track to graduate, as well as make college more affordable</u></strong>, by providing emergency grants, discharging outstanding student debt or unpaid balances, and eliminating transcript withholding practices.</li></ul>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>During Week of Anniversary of American Rescue Plan, Administration Highlights Investments in Historically Black Colleges and Universities</em></p>



<p>Today, the Department of Education announced state-by-state breakdown of <strong><u>over $2.7 billion in funding for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) provided in the President’s American Rescue Plan</u></strong>. These funds were provided through the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund (HEERF) over the past year. HBCUs create pathways to opportunity for Black students and foster academic excellence throughout our nation. This infusion of federal funding – <strong><u>among the largest ever in the country’s HBCUs</u></strong> – is a key part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to shared prosperity and equity for all Americans. This funding also complements other American Rescue Plan funds for critical institutions of higher education that serve communities of color.</p>



<p><strong><u>The American Rescue Plan requires half of these funds to be used to provide direct financial relief to students; the Department of Education expects far more will ultimately be used for that purpose.</u></strong> In addition to funding provided under previous coronavirus relief legislation, these funds are already being used by colleges and universities across the country to serve students and ensure learning continues during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>



<p>Thousands of colleges and universities all across the country are <strong><u>using HEERF to keep students enrolled and on track to graduate, as well as make college more affordable</u></strong>, by providing emergency grants, discharging outstanding student debt or unpaid balances, and eliminating transcript withholding practices.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>New Actions Will Deliver Cleaner Air, Healthier Neighborhoods, and Better Transportation</em></p>



<p>Today, Vice President Kamala Harris is announcing major federal actions that will expand clean public transit and school buses, reduce emissions from dirty diesel trucks, and create good-paying jobs.&nbsp;The Biden-Harris Administration will modernize public transit that connects people to their jobs, school, health care, and loved ones, freight trucks and ports that move goods through the American economy, and the iconic American yellow buses that bring children safely to school leveraging investments from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and American Rescue Plan investments, as well as a new proposed rule that would set heavy-duty vehicle emissions standards. Together, these actions will deliver better transportation for the American people while reducing air pollution that has long overburdened low-income communities and communities of color. They also boost American leadership on the zero-emissions transit, trucking, and port technologies of the future—to create good-paying, union jobs, improve public health, and confront climate change.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Heavy-duty vehicles, like buses and trucks, make up nearly one-quarter of all U.S. transportation greenhouse gas emissions, and heavy-duty vehicles are the largest contributor of nitrogen oxides (NOx)—air pollution that is known to cause asthma, heart and lung disease, and other serious respiratory issues. Neighborhoods near highways, ports, and other congested areas are especially impacted by health problems and premature deaths associated with dirty diesel exhaust. These burdens disproportionately impact people of color and low-income households.<br><br>To seize new economic opportunities and address these environmental injustices and climate concerns, while expanding public transit and ensuring efficient delivery of goods, the Administration is announcing a fleet of new and expanded actions to advance clean heavy-duty vehicles, as part of our electric, zero-emissions transportation future:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Cleaner, More Convenient Public Transit:</strong> The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law represents the single largest investment in public transit in history. As part of the historic $5.5 billion expansion of the Low- and No-Emission Transit Vehicle Program, the Department of Transportation (DOT) is announcing $1.1 billion in funding for 2022 and an additional $372 million under the Bus and Bus Facilities program. The Low-No Program helps state and local governments purchase U.S.-built electric transit buses and other cleaner models, to improve local air quality and expand affordable, accessible, transportation options in communities across the country. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law increased Low-No program funding by ten times, compared to the prior five years.&nbsp; Also, as a result of changes enacted in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the grants will dedicate funding to workforce training that helps protect and upskill transit workers – ensuring that those who work on transit vehicles today are ready to do so in the future. To keep transit workers on the job and transit services running, DOT is also announcing $2.2 billion in funding to 35 transit agencies across 18 states through the American Rescue Plan.<br></li><li><strong>Saving Lives, Reducing Emissions:</strong> The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is issuing a proposed rule that would, if finalized, dramatically reduce harmful nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions from heavy-duty vehicles and set stronger greenhouse gas emissions standards for certain heavy-duty vehicle categories. This proposed rule would ensure heavy-duty vehicles and engines are as clean as possible while helping jump-start the transition to zero-emission vehicles in the heavy-duty fleet. When fully implemented, this rule will save roughly 2,000 lives annually, eliminate 18,000 cases of childhood asthma, and lead to 1.1 million fewer missed days of school.<br></li><li><strong>Electrifying School Buses: </strong>The Environmental Protection Agency is awarding $17 million to fund electric zero-emission and low-emission school buses. Through the American Rescue Plan, $7 million is being awarded to replace old diesel school buses in underserved communities with new, zero-emission electric buses. In addition, $10 million is being awarded to replace old diesel school buses with new cleaner buses through the Diesel Emissions Reduction Act (DERA) School Bus Rebate Program. This funding complements the $5 billion in funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law for clean school buses, the first tranche of which will become available in the coming months.<br></li><li><strong>Lower Emissions from Ports:</strong> The Department of Transportation is using new project eligibilities in the Port Infrastructure Development Program – which is now funded at the highest levels ever through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law – to advance clean port equipment like electric vehicle charging infrastructure for drayage trucks, cargo equipment, and harbor craft. <a href="https://www.maritime.dot.gov/PIDPgrants">Grant applicants</a> are encouraged to submit projects that reduce emissions, strengthen resilience, improve air quality in fenceline communities, and plan for the zero-emission ports of the future.<br></li><li><strong>Innovation on Clean Trucks of the Future:</strong> The Department of Energy is partnering with industry to expand zero-emission truck technology through its SuperTruck 3 Program, with the latest round of $127 million in funding focused for the first time on reducing costs and improving durability in hydrogen and battery electric trucks.<br></li><li><strong>Leading by Example:</strong> The General Services Administration is doubling the amount of zero-emission medium and heavy-duty vehicle models available to federal agencies, charging towards 100% zero emission vehicle acquisitions by 2035.</li></ul>



<p>These steps build upon President Biden’s Executive Order on Strengthening American Leadership in Clean Cars and Trucks, which he <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/08/05/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-steps-to-drive-american-leadership-forward-on-clean-cars-and-trucks/">signed</a> in August 2021 alongside American automakers and autoworkers, launching development of smart fuel efficiency and emissions standards across all vehicles. President Biden and Vice President Harris also secured historic investments in clean transportation through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and American Rescue Plan. The announcement today of $1.1 billion for clean transit buses through the $5 billion Lo-No Program expansion, $17 million for clean school buses, and the ongoing buildout of a national EV charging network will transform bus transit from city centers to rural towns – improving connectivity and quality of life – while contributing to President Biden&#8217;s goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50-52% compared to 2005 levels by 2030.<br><br>Together, today’s actions will:<br><br><strong>Electrify Our Buses</strong><br>To accelerate our transition to clean public transit, over $5.5 billion is being infused into the Department of Transportation’s popular Low- and No-Emission Transit Vehicle Program through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law – by far the largest ever investment in this program, and ten times larger than the last five years of funding. The Low-No Program helps state and local governments purchase or lease zero-emission and low-emission transit buses and other vehicles and expand or retrofit supporting facilities. These include vehicles that use technologies such as battery electric and fuel-cell power to provide clean, quieter, and more efficient transit service in communities across the country. In 2022, $1.1 billion will be granted to clean and electrify transit buses – representing almost a billion dollars in new investment compared to last year. This comes on top of nearly $2 billion over five years, and $372 million in 2022, provided in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law for the Buses and Bus Facilities Competitive Program to be used in part for low or no emissions bus projects. &nbsp;The clean buses purchased by these grants will be made here in the United States, creating manufacturing jobs in places like Minnesota, Alabama, South Carolina, and California.<br><br>Also, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provides the first-ever dedicated investment in our transit workforce to support the transition to new clean technologies like battery electric buses.&nbsp; Five percent of grants under the program – up to $280 million over five years – will be used to fund workforce development training, including registered apprenticeships and other labor-management training programs, to train and upskill transit workers to maintain and operate zero emission vehicles and related charging infrastructure.<br><br>To keep all of these buses running – along with our country’s trains, ferries and other transit services – the Department of Transportation is also announcing $2.2 billion in grants to 35 transit agencies across 18 states. These funds are made available through President Biden’s American Rescue Plan and will help public transit agencies pay for day-to-day operations, keep tens of thousands of employees on the payroll, and provide essential transportation services to workers across America.<br><br>The EPA is also moving to deploy more clean school buses – awarding $17 million in rebates to fund electric zero-emission and low-emission school buses. Through the American Rescue Plan, $7 million is being awarded to replace old diesel school buses with new, zero-emission electric buses. These funds are reserved exclusively for school districts in underserved communities, tribal schools, and the private fleets serving those schools. In addition, the EPA awarded $10 million to replace old diesel school buses with new electric, diesel, gasoline, propane, or compressed natural gas buses through longstanding Diesel Emissions Reduction Act (DERA) School Bus Rebates. Later this year, major new investments funded by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law’s new $5 billion clean school bus program will allow EPA to greatly expand the impacts of clean school bus deployment.<br><br><strong>Reduce Truck Emissions, Save Lives</strong><br>Today, the EPA announced a proposed rule that would reduce NOx emissions from new trucks by up to 90% by 2031 compared to today&#8217;s standards. The current regulations set under the Clean Air Act for trucks were last updated over 20 years ago. However, trucks meeting this standard are still major sources of NOx and other harmful pollutants.<br><br>All traditional truck engines combust fuel which leads to creation of NOx – a harmful pollutant and precursor to the formation of smog and particulates. This pollution makes it difficult to breathe, triggers asthma and other lung diseases and is associated with premature death. These harmful conditions disproportionately impact low-income communities and communities of color. Without the actions taken today and the resulting shift to low- and zero-emission vehicles, these communities will continue to bear the brunt of these emissions.<br><br>When this rule is fully implemented, there will be numerous benefits to communities around the country, including:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Lives Saved:</strong> Roughly 2,000 premature deaths avoided and 6,700 fewer hospital and ER visits each year;</li><li><strong>Healthy School Kids</strong>: 18,000 fewer cases of childhood asthma and 1.1 million fewer missed days of school each year;</li><li><strong>Productive Communities</strong>: 78,000 fewer missed days of work each year.</li></ul>



<p>In addition to strengthening NOx regulations, EPA and DOT are preparing to redouble the Administration&#8217;s commitment to zero-emissions trucks by using the upcoming Heavy-Duty GHG Phase 3 Program to set ambitious greenhouse gas and efficiency standards beginning in 2030. Because costs have fallen and state and local policy will drive deployment, zero-emission trucks and buses are entering the market much faster than anticipated when rules were previously set. To account for this, EPA is considering technical updates to its standards for model years 2027 to 2029 to better reflect new levels of market penetration in segments with expected zero-emission vehicle deployment.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Clean Our Port Operations</strong><br>The ports on our coasts, rivers, and Great Lakes will need to be transformed to eliminate pollution affecting neighboring communities, address climate change, and strengthen supply chain resilience. This includes a focus on reducing emissions from heavy-duty road vehicles and rail that play key roles in port operations.<br><br>The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provides the largest investment ever in the <a href="https://www.transportation.gov/briefing-room/president-biden-and-us-department-transportation-announce-historic-new-funding">DOT&#8217;s Port Infrastructure Development Program</a> – with the expansion designed to advance the Administration&#8217;s climate and environmental justice goals. Grant applicants are encouraged to submit projects that reduce emissions, strengthen resilience, and improve air quality in fenceline communities. These investments will touch all points of port operations – cleaning cargo handling equipment, harbor craft, and building out needed charging infrastructure for drayage trucks. The program also encourages master planning for port electrification and grid upgrades. In addition, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funded DOT to issue new grants to reduce truck idling and emissions at ports, including through the advancement of port electrification, which will complement other port investments.<br><br><strong>Catalyze Zero Emission Truck Infrastructure<br></strong>Through the President&#8217;s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the Departments of Energy and Transportation are making significant investments in updating the nation&#8217;s trucking fleets and freight infrastructure to be cleaner and more efficient.<br><br>To spur investment in zero emission trucks, the Federal Transit Administration, in conjunction with the Federal Highway Administration, is helping states purchase medium and heavy-duty vehicles through the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Program. DOE&#8217;s Loan Program Office has been given expanded authority for manufacturing of clean medium and heavy-duty on-road vehicles as well as vehicles and components in the aviation, maritime, and rail sectors, pending future appropriations.<br><br>To advance the build-out of our nation&#8217;s network of 500,000 EV chargers, DOT’s recent EV charging guidance to states includes eligibility to support charging infrastructure for trucks. Given the unique needs of medium- and heavy-duty vehicles, DOE’s Sustainable Transportation offices are studying how to advance clean, affordable hydrogen and electrification corridor solutions to connect ports, highways, and end users, and provide clean freight solutions to move goods and materials from first mile to the last.<br><br><strong>Accelerate Path Towards Zero-Emission Trucks</strong><br>Through major advances in zero-emissions technology, clean trucks are becoming cheaper and more readily available. Today, the National Renewable Energy Lab published a study showing that zero emission electric medium and heavy-duty trucks can reach total-cost-of-driving parity with diesel counterparts for many vehicle types this decade and for all trucks by 2035. As technology continues to improve, and more infrastructure is deployed, more and more clean trucks will become cost-effective. That&#8217;s good for business and good for the planet.<br><br>In order to continue to drive down costs, the Department of Energy is investing in trucking innovation and next generation clean technologies. In 2009, DOE launched its SuperTruck Initiative to partner with industry to improve heavy-duty truck freight efficiency by 50%. This year, SuperTruck 3 is off to the races with a combined $127 million in funding to industry focused on reducing costs and improving durability in zero-emission hydrogen and battery electric trucks. In addition, its SuperTruck 2 Program is set to conclude this year having developed cost-effective technology that doubles the fuel economy for 18-wheeler trucks.<br><br>Multiple other research projects across government and industry are targeting progress in fuel cell electric trucks, batteries, and freight efficiency, including:</p>



<ul><li>Advanced Research on Integrated Energy Systems (ARIES) – providing a real world environment for testing large battery and fuel cell electric trucks.</li><li>Million Mile Fuel Cell Truck consortium – developing cost-effective technology with industry for next generation fuel cells.</li><li>21<sup>st</sup> Century Truck Partnership – launching a new electrification tech team focused on removing barriers to wide-scale truck electrification and deploying technology to improve freight efficiency.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Transform the Federal Truck Fleet</strong><br>This Administration is leading by example – acting as an early adopter by transforming its federal fleet of over 110,000 medium- and heavy-duty vehicles. [1] Today, federal agencies are able to acquire 38 different models of medium and heavy duty zero emissions vehicles through the General Services Administration – more than double the offerings in fiscal year 2021. The President&#8217;s Federal Sustainability Plan, outlined in <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/12/13/2021-27114/catalyzing-clean-energy-industries-and-jobs-through-federal-sustainability">Executive Order 14057</a>, also calls for 100% of all annual medium and heavy-duty vehicle acquisitions to be zero emissions by 2035.<br><br>The federal government will work with American vehicle, battery, and charging equipment manufacturers and installers to transform its truck fleet. This will accelerate the advancement of America&#8217;s industrial capacity to supply zero-emission trucks and electric batteries – creating and sustaining good-paying, union jobs in manufacturing, engineering, and skilled trades. This federal truck transformation complements the Administration&#8217;s commitment to 100% zero-emission light-duty vehicle acquisitions by 2027.<br> </p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Edmund Pettus Bridge<br>Selma, Alabama</em></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><br></p>



<p>3:34 P.M. CST<br><br>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Good afternoon, Selma.&nbsp; Good afternoon.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Kendra, thank you for those inspiring words.&nbsp; In the great tradition of Alabama State, you are a leader of outstanding passion and purpose, and it is wonderful to have shared the stage with you.<br>&nbsp;<br>So, Selma, before I begin, I want to say a few words about the situation in Ukraine.&nbsp; Today, the eyes of the world are on Ukraine and the brave people who are fighting to protect their country and their democracy.&nbsp; And their bravery is a reminder that freedom and democracy can never be taken for granted by any of us.<br>&nbsp;<br>With that, it is a privilege to be among so many distinguished leaders, dedicated activists, friends, and American heroes &#8212; and to be with so many members of Congress, of our Cabinet, who are all representing our nation and representing our administration.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>It is a particular honor to be joined by the family of Congressman John Lewis and the family of Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. (Applause.)&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So, today, we gather here on hallowed ground.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>It was a chilly&nbsp;Sunday morning, 57 years ago, when 600 brave individuals set out from Selma.&nbsp; They were marching for the most fundamental right of American citizenship: The right to vote.<br>&nbsp;<br>They knew that if they wanted true freedom, if they wanted to claim what was theirs by birth and by right, they had to march on this bridge on that day.&nbsp; They were prepared for the worst.<br>&nbsp;<br>And on this bridge on that day the worst found them.&nbsp; Their peaceful protest was met with crushing violence.&nbsp; They were kneeling when the state troopers charged.&nbsp; They were praying when the billy clubs struck.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>On this bridge on that day, those brave marchers continued to push forward to secure the freedom to vote, and they were pushed back.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Today, we stand on this bridge at a different time.&nbsp; We again, however, find ourselves caught in between &#8212; between injustice and justice, between disappointment and determination &#8212; still in a fight to form “a more perfect union.”&nbsp; And nowhere is that more clear than when it comes to the ongoing fight to secure the freedom to vote.<br>&nbsp;<br>A record number of people cast their ballots in the 2020 elections.&nbsp; It was a triumph of democracy in many ways.&nbsp; But not everyone saw it that way.&nbsp; Some saw it as a threat.&nbsp; And so, as powerful people have done many times in our nation&#8217;s history, they launched an assault on the freedom to vote.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Across the country, states passed anti-voting laws &#8212; laws that ban drop boxes and restrict early voting; laws that make it illegal to give food and water to voters who are standing and waiting in line; laws that, put simply, make it much more difficult for people to vote with an expectation that then we will not vote. &nbsp;Undemocratic laws. &nbsp;Un-American laws.<br>&nbsp;<br>And so, last year, we all joined together.&nbsp; We locked arms<br>and lifted our voices and fought to pass federal voting rights legislation.&nbsp; We brought the Freedom to Vote Act and, yes, the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act to the floor of the Senate.<br>&nbsp;<br>And on the night of January 19th, every Republican senator in the United States Senate voted to block passage of this law.<br>&nbsp;<br>Over the past few months, I have traveled our country talking with so many people about our fight &#8212; our collective fight to safeguard and strengthen the freedom to vote: faith leaders, community leaders, students, activists, and organizers.&nbsp; And, yes, people are tired and frustrated and, at times, scared &#8212; scared that we risk losing the rights we fought so hard to win.<br>&nbsp;<br>I believe, at this moment, we are faced with a choice &#8212; a choice that we have faced many times before: Do we stand or do we fight?<br>&nbsp;<br>Gathered at this bridge, reflecting on its history, yes, I know the path forward is clear.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Remember, it took three tries for the marchers to cross the bridge.&nbsp; It took their sweat, their tears, their blood.&nbsp; It took their resilience, their determination, and their courage.&nbsp; And, yes, it even took the protection of the National Guard and federal marshals.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>In a moment of great uncertainty, those marchers pressed forward and they crossed.&nbsp; We must do the same.&nbsp; We must lock our arms and march forward.&nbsp; We will not let setbacks stop us.<br>&nbsp;<br>We know that honoring the legacy of those who marched then<br>demands that we continue to push Congress to pass federal voting rights legislation &#8212; (applause) &#8212; and it also demands we continue to push the Senate not to allow an arcane rule to deny us this sacred right.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>It demands we continue to lift up state legislatures that have passed pro-voter laws and that we keep fighting to prevent the passage of anti-voter laws.&nbsp; It demands we keep going to court to defend this sacred freedom.&nbsp; And it demands we register voters, volunteer as election workers, and, yes, of course, drive souls to the polls.<br>&nbsp;<br>And none of this is new, especially to so many of you who have been in this fight for so long.<br>&nbsp;<br>So I am here &#8212; again, here in Selma &#8212; to say thank you for your work, your sacrifice, and your dedication.<br>&nbsp;<br>And I have come here today to also remind you that we all stand together.&nbsp; President Biden and I are working for this cause every day.&nbsp; We have put the full power of the executive branch behind our shared effort.&nbsp; And if we all continue to work together, to march together, to fight together, we will secure the freedom to vote.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Selma, the future of our democracy is being decided now by you, by us, by the people.&nbsp; And ultimately, you are the ones &#8212; we are the ones &#8212; who must protect the freedom to vote.&nbsp; And we must not stop there.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Those who marched across this bridge &#8212; yes, they marched for the freedom to vote; they also marched for all of the rights and freedoms that voting unlocks.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; They marched for economic justice, for social justice, for racial justice &#8212; (applause) &#8212; and we must do the same.<br>&nbsp;<br>We must fight to ensure all the people of our nation &#8212; no matter where they start &#8212; have the opportunity to succeed.&nbsp; We must fight to move our nation forward while we reflect on why it matters.<br>&nbsp;<br>Just think: Last week, President Biden made history when he nominated the first Black woman, Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson &#8212; (applause) &#8212; to the highest court in our land &#8212; the court where decisions are made about the Constitutional rights and liberties and freedoms of every American to generational effect.<br>&nbsp;<br>And I’ll tell you what I think you know: Judge Jackson is a phenomenal jurist with a record of excellence &#8212; a record that proves her commitment not only to public service but to equal justice and equal rights.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And as she makes history, Judge Jackson, like us all, stands on the shoulders of giants.&nbsp; She and we are their legacy &#8212; (applause) &#8212; the legacy of those who are with us today: Annie Pearl Avery &#8212; (applause) &#8212; Charles Mauldin &#8212; (applause) &#8212; Bernard Lafayette &#8212; (applause) &#8212; Sheyann Webb-Christburg &#8212; (applause); the legacy of those who are smiling down on us: Marie Foster &#8212; (applause) &#8212; J.D. Hunter &#8212; (applause) &#8212; C.J. Adams &#8212; (applause) &#8212; Amelia Boynton Robinson &#8212; (applause) &#8212; and of all those courageous foot soldiers for freedom who named &#8212; and whose names we know and sometimes names we will not know but who lift us up nonetheless.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The last time I was in Selma was the last time Congressman John Lewis stood on this bridge.&nbsp; For his whole life, and especially that day, John Lewis was the embodiment of strength and resilience, the epitome of dignity, grace, and perseverance.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>As he stood here that day, you could see the body that carried him across this bridge all those years ago had become fragile, but the spirit that carried him was as strong as ever.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>AUDIENCE MEMBER:&nbsp; That’s right!<br>&nbsp;<br>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; John Lewis &#8212; well, he never gave up the fight.&nbsp; He returned to this bridge again, and again, and again.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>It is that clarity of purpose, that relentless dedication, that spirit &#8212; the spirit of Selma &#8212; that we summon today.<br>&nbsp;<br>We will keep fighting.&nbsp; We will keep organizing. &nbsp;We will keep shouting.&nbsp; We will keep making good trouble.&nbsp; And we will march on until victory is won.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Thank you, all.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Thank you, all.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>END&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3:48 P.M.

<p>On Sunday, March 7, 1965, time stopped and blood spilled as brave and righteous Americans sought to cross a bridge named after a Klansman in Selma, Alabama, to reach the other side of justice. Led by the late John Lewis, they marched to secure their sacred right to vote. Their heroism was met by batons and tear gas. They were beaten, but not defeated. Their absolute courage forced America to look in the mirror and Congress to act. Soon after, President Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act of 1965.</p>



<p>But over time, the strength of that groundbreaking law has been weakened not by brute force, but by insidious court decisions. Today, we’re seeing states across the country propose or enact laws that make it harder to vote and have that vote counted — an onslaught of deeply dangerous efforts to suppress the vote and subvert entire elections.</p>



<p>In Selma, the blood of John Lewis and so many other courageous Americans sanctified a noble struggle. We are determined to honor that legacy by passing legislation to protect the right to vote and uphold the integrity of our elections, including the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and the Freedom to Vote Act.</p>



<p>My Administration will continue implementing my <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/09/28/fact-sheet-biden-administration-promotes-voter-participation-with-new-agency-steps/">Executive Order</a> to promote voter participation, increase access to the ballot, and rally the country to protect voting rights and election integrity. Vice President Harris, marching in Selma today, will continue to lead this effort. The U.S. Justice Department has doubled its voting rights enforcement staff to stop discriminatory voting laws as the Voting Rights Act of 1965 empowered it to do. And I will continue to use every tool at my disposal to strengthen our democracy and keep alive the promise of America for all Americans.</p>



<p>The battle for the soul of America has many fronts. The right to vote is the most fundamental.</p>
