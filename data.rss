<p>Yesterday, National Cyber Director Chris Inglis hosted Deputy Secretary of Health and Human Services Andrea Palm, senior U.S. government cybersecurity officials, and CEOs and other senior executives representing entities on the Health Sector Coordinating Council Cybersecurity Working Group Executive Committee for a cyber threat briefing and roundtable discussion about cybersecurity in the healthcare and public health sector. Participants discussed the five-year anniversary of the Health Care Industry Cybersecurity Task Force’s “Report on Improving Cybersecurity in the Health Care Industry,” including the progress that has been made since the report came out and areas where additional focus is needed. Deputy Secretary Palm provided an update on HHS’s work to finalize a sector incident response plan, and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Deputy Director Nitin Natarajan shared resources CISA has available to help manage cybersecurity risk in critical infrastructure sectors, including healthcare. Healthcare CEOs and senior executives relayed their experiences protecting their systems, products, and patients; the investments they’ve made to combat growing cyber threats; and the challenges they’ve faced in dealing with vulnerabilities in the cyber ecosystem. All of the participants agreed on the importance of additional collaboration, including through exercises, to help improve cybersecurity in the sector.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>As part of the Unity Agenda that I laid out in my State of the Union address, I called on Congress to make sure that veterans and their families and caregivers impacted by toxic exposures finally get the benefits and comprehensive health care they earned and deserve. Today, the United States Senate answered that call by overwhelmingly passing the bipartisan<em>&nbsp;Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring Our PACT Act of&nbsp;</em>2022­—the largest single bill in American history to address our service members’ exposure to burn pits and other toxic substances.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This bill will provide expanded access to health care and disability benefits for veterans harmed by certain toxic exposures, whether in the jungles of Vietnam or the mountains of Afghanistan. It will also let the Department of Veterans Affairs move more quickly and comprehensively in the future to determine if illnesses are related to military service, and it will offer critical support to survivors who were harmed by exposures, including from water contamination at Camp LeJeune. Importantly, the bill includes the tools and resources to ensure that the VA can effectively implement it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Above all, this legislation makes good on our sacred obligation to care for veterans, their families, caregivers, and survivors. I want to thank Chair Tester and Ranking Member Moran for their remarkable work to pass the PACT Act, and I urge the House to swiftly pass this bill so I can sign it into law right away.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Via Teleconference</em></p>



<p>10:11 A.M. EDT<br><br>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Thank you, Gene Sperling.&nbsp; Thank you, and for your extraordinary longstanding service to our country, including the work that you have been doing to ensure the &#8212; the speedy and effective and meaningful implementation of the ARP.&nbsp; So, thank you for that.</p>



<p>I do believe our nation is facing a maternal mortality crisis, given the extent of the work that we as an administration have been doing with our partners.&nbsp; And &#8212; and it is evidenced by the fact that women in our nation are dying from pregnancy-related causes at a higher rate than any other developed nation &#8212; dying before, during, and after childbirth.</p>



<p>Black women are three times more likely to be affected by this and to die from childbirth-related causes.&nbsp; Native women, twice as likely.&nbsp; Rural women, one and a half times likely.</p>



<p>So, our administration has taken historic action to elevate this issue and protect the women of our nation.&nbsp;It&#8217;s that simple.</p>



<p>Last year, we hosted the first-ever White House Maternal Health Day of Action.&nbsp; And this year, I was pleased to bring together members of our Cabinet to focus on the issue of maternal health, which followed, as Gene mentioned, a Call to Action to states to extend Medicaid coverage for postpartum women from 2 months &#8212; from a mere 2 months &#8212; to 12 months.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And notably, the ARP gives &#8212; and gives the states the authority to do this.&nbsp; So, again, the connection between this initiative and the details of the ARP and its implementation have made all the difference.&nbsp; And it matters because, of course, Medicaid covers approximately 40 percent of all births nationwide, and one third of pregnancy-related deaths occur between one and a half months and one year postpartum.</p>



<p>Throughout my career, as Gene has said, I do believe that one of the greatest priorities for us in public policy must be the health, safety, and wellbeing of women, including maternal health.&nbsp; And so, today, we are proud to announce that the Centers for Medicaid and Medicaid Service &#8212; and Medicare Services will expand coverage and approve the expansion of coverage in the states of Maine, Minnesota, in&nbsp;<s>New York</s>&nbsp;[New Mexico], and in Washington, D.C.</p>



<p>What this means is that 235,000 women will now have access to 12 months of critical postpartum coverage across 14 states and D.C.&nbsp; This means that 12 months of pelvic exams, vaccinations, postpartum depression screening, and regular checkups will be available to those women.</p>



<p>And I think I said New Mexico and I cer- &#8212; I &#8212; New York &#8212; and I certainly meant New Mexico &#8212; (laughs) &#8212; so I&#8217;ll go back to that.&nbsp;<br><br>But what it also means is that the states now, under the leadership of extraordinary leaders &#8212; like Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham, under the leadership of Lieutenant Governor Peggy Flanagan &#8212; can take the step forward and do what we know the women of America need and deserve, which is to have assistance and to have some recognition about what the realities of this are and what their needs are.<br>This is only the beginning.&nbsp; Our administration will continue to fight until every state has expanded Medicaid coverage.&nbsp; And to be clear, this is about prioritizing the right all women in our nation should have to full reproductive healthcare.</p>



<p>That is what this is about.&nbsp; It is about understanding how all women in our nation, regardless of their income, regardless of where they live, should have access to full reproductive healthcare.</p>



<p>So, together, of course, we are going to continue to work with our partners at the state level, at the local level, our community-based and nonprofit folks to ensure that every woman, every mother has the healthcare she needs to thrive.</p>



<p>And with that, I&#8217;ll turn it back over to the team.&nbsp; And &#8212; and thank you all.<br><br>END&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10:15 A.M. EDT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>MEMORANDUM FOR THE HEADS OF EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES</p>



<p>SUBJECT:       Establishment of the White House Task Force to <br>                           Address Online Harassment and Abuse</p>



<p>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to improve efforts to prevent and address online harassment and abuse, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>



<p>Section 1.  Policy.  Technology platforms and social media can be vital tools for expression, civic participation, and building a sense of community.  But the scale, reach, and amplification effects of technology platforms have also exacerbated gender-based violence, particularly through online harassment and abuse.  Online harassment and abuse include a broad array of harmful and sometimes illegal behaviors that are perpetrated through the use of technology.  Women, adolescent girls, and LGBTQI+ individuals, who may be additionally targeted because of their race, ethnicity, religion, and other factors, can experience more severe harms from online harassment and abuse.  Online harassment and abuse take many forms, including the non-consensual distribution of intimate digital images; cyberstalking; sextortion; doxing; malicious deep fakes; gendered disinformation; rape and death threats; the online recruitment and exploitation of victims of sex trafficking; and various forms of technology-facilitated intimate partner abuse.  In the United States, 1 in 3 women under the age of 35 reports having been sexually harassed online, and over half of LGBTQI+ individuals report having been the target of severe online abuse, including sustained harassment, physical threats, and stalking in addition to sexual harassment.  Globally, half of girls report that they are more likely to be harassed through social media than on the street.</p>



<p>In the United States and around the world, women and LGBTQI+ political leaders, public figures, activists, and journalists are especially targeted by sexualized forms of online harassment and abuse, undermining their ability to exercise their human rights and participate in democracy, governance, and civic life.&nbsp;&nbsp;Online abuse and harassment, which aim to preclude women from political decision-making about their own lives and communities, undermine the functioning of democracy.&nbsp;&nbsp;Growing evidence also demonstrates that online radicalization can be linked to gender-based violence, which, along with other forms of abuse and harassment, spans the digital and physical realms.&nbsp;&nbsp;Online harassment and abuse can result in a range of dire consequences for victims, from psychological distress and self-censorship to economic losses, disruptions to education, increased self-harm, suicide, homicide, and other forms of physical and sexual violence.&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, digital technologies are often used in concert with other forms of abuse and harassment, underscoring the urgency of addressing the interplay of in-person and online harms.&nbsp;&nbsp;More research is needed to fully understand the nature, magnitude, and costs of these harms and ways to address them in the United&nbsp;States and globally.</p>



<p>Therefore, I am directing the Director of the White House Gender Policy Council and the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs to lead an interagency effort to address online harassment and abuse, specifically focused on technology-facilitated gender-based violence, and to&nbsp;develop concrete recommendations to improve prevention, response, and protection efforts through programs and policies in the United States and globally.</p>



<p>Sec.&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Establishment.&nbsp;&nbsp;There&nbsp;is established within the Executive Office of the President the White House Task Force to Address Online Harassment and Abuse (Task Force).</p>



<p>Sec.&nbsp;3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Membership.&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;Director of the White House Gender Policy Council and the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs,&nbsp;or their designees, shall serve as Co-Chairs of the Task Force.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the Co-Chairs, the Task Force shall consist of the following members:</p>



<p>(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Secretary of State;</p>



<p>(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Secretary of Defense;&nbsp;</p>



<p>(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Attorney General;</p>



<p>(iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Secretary of Commerce;</p>



<p>(v)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Secretary of Health and Human Services;</p>



<p>(vi)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Secretary of Education;</p>



<p>(vii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Secretary of Veterans Affairs;</p>



<p>(viii)&nbsp;&nbsp;the Secretary of Homeland Security;</p>



<p>(ix)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy;</p>



<p>(x)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Assistant to the President and Director of the Domestic Policy Council;</p>



<p>(xi)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy and Director of the National Economic Council;</p>



<p>(xii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development;</p>



<p>(xiii)&nbsp;&nbsp;the Counsel to the President;&nbsp;</p>



<p>(xiv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Counsel to the Vice President; and</p>



<p>(xv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the heads of such other executive departments, agencies, and offices as the Co-Chairs may, from time to time, designate.</p>



<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;A member of the Task Force may designate, to perform the Task Force functions of the member, senior officials within the member&#8217;s executive department, agency, or office who are full-time officers or employees of the Federal Government.</p>



<p>Sec.&nbsp;4.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mission and Function.&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;The Task Force shall work across executive departments, agencies, and offices to assess and address online harassment and abuse that constitute technology-facilitated gender-based violence, including by:&nbsp;</p>

<p>(vi)    identifying additional opportunities to improve efforts to prevent and address technology-facilitated gender-based violence in United States foreign policy and foreign assistance, including through the Global Partnership for Action on Gender-Based Online Harassment and Abuse.</p>



<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;Consistent with the objectives of this memorandum and applicable law, the Task Force may consult with and gather relevant information from external stakeholders, including&nbsp;Federal, State, local, Tribal, and territorial government officials, as well as victim advocates, survivors, law enforcement personnel, researchers and academics, civil and human rights groups, philanthropic leaders, technology experts, legal and international policy experts, industry stakeholders, and other entities and persons the Task Force identifies that will assist the Task Force in accomplishing the objectives of this memorandum.</p>



<p>Sec.&nbsp;5.&nbsp;&nbsp;Reporting on the Work and Recommendations of the Task Force.&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;Within 180 days of the date of this memorandum, the Co-Chairs of the Task Force shall submit to the President a blueprint (Initial Blueprint) outlining a whole-of-government approach to preventing and addressing technology-facilitated gender-based violence, including concrete actions that executive departments, agencies, and offices have committed to take to implement the Task Force&#8217;s recommendations.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Initial Blueprint shall include a synopsis of key lessons from stakeholder consultations and preliminary recommendations for advancing strategies to improve efforts to prevent and address technology-facilitated gender-based violence.&nbsp;&nbsp;Following submission of the Initial Blueprint to the President, the Co-Chairs of the Task Force shall make an executive summary of the Initial Blueprint publicly available.</p>



<p>(b)  Within 1 year of the date that the Initial Blueprint is submitted to the President, the Co-Chairs of the Task Force shall submit to the President and make publicly available an update and report (1-Year Report) with additional recommendations and actions that executive departments, agencies, and offices can take to advance how Federal, State, local, Tribal, and territorial governments; service providers; international organizations; technology platforms; schools; and other public and private entities can improve efforts to prevent and address technology-facilitated gender-based violence.</p>



<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to issuing its Initial Blueprint and 1-Year Report, the Co-Chairs of the Task Force shall consolidate&nbsp;any input received and&nbsp;submit periodic recommendations to the President on policies, regulatory actions, and legislation&nbsp;on technology sector accountability to address systemic harms to people affected by online harassment and abuse.</p>



<p>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the submission of the 1-Year Report to the President, the Co-Chairs of the Task Force shall, on an annual basis, submit a follow-up report to the President on implementation of this memorandum.</p>



<p>Sec.&nbsp;6.&nbsp;&nbsp;Definition.&nbsp;&nbsp;For the purposes of this memorandum, the term &#8220;technology-facilitated gender-based violence&#8221; shall refer to any form of gender-based violence, including harassment and abuse, which takes place through, or is aided by, the use of digital technologies and devices.</p>



<p>Sec.&nbsp;7.&nbsp;&nbsp;General Provisions.&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>Today, President Biden will sign a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2022/06/16/memorandum-on-the-establishment-of-the-white-house-task-force-to-address-online-harassment-and-abuse/">Presidential Memorandum</a> establishing the White House Task Force to Address Online Harassment and Abuse, responding to the need for government leadership to address online harms, which disproportionately affect women, girls, people of color, and LGBTQI+ individuals. Vice President Harris will launch the Task Force by hosting a survivor and expert roundtable this afternoon. The tragic events in Buffalo and Uvalde have underscored a fact known all too well by many Americans: the internet can fuel hate, misogyny, and abuse with spillover effects that threaten our communities and safety offline. </p>



<p>President Biden has long championed efforts to prevent and address gender-based violence, including writing and passing the landmark Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) nearly three decades ago as a U.S. Senator and signing its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/03/16/fact-sheet-reauthorization-of-the-violence-against-women-act-vawa/">reauthorization</a>&nbsp;into law earlier this year.&nbsp;&nbsp;The reauthorized VAWA includes historic new protections against online harassment and abuse. Vice President Harris, who is hosting today’s Task Force, has long been a champion of addressing online harassment and abuse throughout her career, including as United States Senator and California’s Attorney General.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Task Force will produce recommendations for the Federal government, state governments, technology platforms, schools, and other public and private entities to prevent and address technology-facilitated gender-based violence, including a focus on&nbsp;the nexus between online misogyny and radicalization to violence.&nbsp;&nbsp;Recommendations will focus particularly on: increasing support for survivors of online harassment and abuse; expanding research to better understand the impact and scope of the problem; enhancing prevention, including prevention focused on youth; and strengthening accountability for offenders and platforms. The Task Force will be co-chaired by the Gender Policy Council and the National Security Council, and will include the Attorney General, the Secretary of Health and Human Services and other heads of Federal agencies.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Strengthening the Federal Response to Online Harms: White House Task Force to Address Online Harassment and Abuse</strong><br></p>



<p>The Task Force is an interagency effort to address online harassment and abuse, specifically focused on technology-facilitated gender-based violence. In consultation with survivors, advocates, educators, experts from diverse fields, and the private sector, the Task Force will develop specific recommendations to improve prevention, response, and protection efforts through programs and policies in the United States and globally by:</p>



<ul><li>Improving coordination among executive departments, agencies, and offices to maximize the Federal Government&#8217;s effectiveness in preventing and addressing technology-facilitated gender-based violence in the United States and globally, including by developing policy solutions to enhance accountability for those who perpetrate online harms;</li><li>Enhancing and expanding data collection and research across the Federal Government to measure the costs, prevalence, exposure to, and impact of technology-facilitated gender-based violence, including by studying the mental health effects of harassment and abuse perpetrated through social media, particularly affecting adolescents;&nbsp;</li><li>Increasing access to survivor-centered services, information, and support for victims, and increasing training and technical assistance for Federal, State, Tribal, local, and territorial governments, as well as for global organizations and entities in the fields of criminal justice, health and mental health services, education, and victim services;</li><li>Developing programs and policies to address the disproportionate impact of online harassment, abuse, and disinformation campaigns targeting women and LGBTQI+ individuals who are public and political figures, government and civic leaders, activists, and journalists in the United States and globally;&nbsp;</li><li>Examining existing Federal laws, regulations, and policies to evaluate the adequacy of the current legal framework to address technology-facilitated gender-based violence and provide recommendations for strengthening it; and</li><li>Identifying additional opportunities to improve efforts to prevent and address technology-facilitated gender-based violence in United States foreign policy and foreign assistance, including through the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.state.gov/2022-roadmap-for-the-global-partnership-for-action-on-gender-based-online-harassment-and-abuse/">Global Partnership for Action on Gender-Based Online Harassment and Abuse.</a></li></ul>



<p><br><strong>Background<br></strong>When President Biden first wrote and championed the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) in the early 1990s, the internet was still in its infancy. Today, the internet has transformed our ability to connect, communicate, and access services and support. At the same time, social media and other forms of technology are increasingly misused as tools of abuse, harassment, and exploitation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the United States, one in three women under the age of 35 report being sexually harassed online, and over half of LGBTQI+ individuals report being the target of severe online abuse. Individuals may also be disproportionately targeted because of their race, gender and gender identity, ethnicity, religion, age, disability, sexual orientation, or at the intersection of various identities.&nbsp;&nbsp;Online harassment and abuse take many forms, including the non-consensual distribution of intimate digital images; cyberstalking; sextortion; doxing; malicious deep fakes; gendered disinformation; rape and death threats; the distribution of child sexual abuse materials; online recruitment and exploitation of victims of sex trafficking, including youth; and various other forms of technology-facilitated intimate partner abuse.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Technology-facilitated gender-based violence can have serious consequences, ranging from psychological distress and negative health impacts, including self-harm and suicide, to self-censorship and disruptions to education and economic loss.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can also lead to physical and sexual violence, including homicide.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the United States and around the world, women and LGBTQI+ political leaders, public figures, activists, and journalists face virulent and often sexualized online harassment and abuse, which can undermine human rights and full participation in democracy, governance, and civic life.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Recent mass shootings have also underscored the connections between online harassment, hate, misogyny, and extremist acts.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the Uvalde shooter had a history of threatening girls online, yet these violent, sexualized harms and threats were dismissed and ignored when reported.&nbsp;&nbsp;In their annual report on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.secretservice.gov/sites/default/files/reports/2020-09/MAPS2019.pdf">Mass Attacks in Public Spaces</a>,&nbsp;the U.S. Secret Service notes that special focus should be given to assessing threats and preventing violence related to “men who use digital platforms to voice misogynistic views and general animosity toward women.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>The Biden-Harris Administration Efforts to Combat Online Harassment and Abuse&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>President Biden and Vice President Harris have long been committed to standing with survivors of gender-based violence wherever it occurs—including online. Through this Task Force, they will lead a strategic vision for countering online forms of violence, harassment and abuse. Alongside the launch of the Task Force, the Biden-Harris Administration is undertaking several key actions, including:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Advancing Technology to Assist Victims of Crime Program.</strong>&nbsp;The Department of Justice (DOJ) Office for Victims of Crime will award $3 million to victim services organizations through the&nbsp;<a href="https://ovc.ojp.gov/funding/opportunities/o-ovc-2022-171237">Advancing the Use of Technology to Assist Victims of Crime</a>&nbsp;program. This program will support initiatives that use technology to increase access to services and information about victims’ rights,&nbsp;enhance service providers’ understanding of technology-facilitated gender-based violence, and strengthen the responsiveness of victim service organizations supporting survivors of technology-facilitated gender-based violence.</li><li><strong>National Domestic Violence Hotline Survivor Survey</strong>. The National Domestic Violence Hotline, through funding from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Family Violence Prevention and Services Program, will provide a preliminary report on its survivor survey research project, which was undertaken this spring and for the first-time asked survivors about their experiences of online harassment and abuse. The Hotline heard from approximately 1,000 survivors who completed the survey.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Every</em>&nbsp;survivor reported they had experienced at least one form of online harassment or abuse, including 45% who said they experienced cyberstalking, 27% reported being threatened with the posting of intimate images without permission; 17% reported the posting of intimate pictures without permission; and 12% reported sextortion. These insights will help inform the work of the Task Force.</li><li><strong>Research from the National Threat Assessment Center</strong>. The U.S. Secret Service’s National Threat Assessment Center (NTAC), under the Department of Homeland Security, is adding to its&nbsp;research on the nexus between online misogyny and domestic terrorism by&nbsp;preparing a report examining the role of domestic violence as a motive and precursor to mass violence, including an analysis of the prior communications and online presence of the attackers. This report will build on its most recent report,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.secretservice.gov/sites/default/files/reports/2022-03/NTAC%20Case%20Study%20-%20Hot%20Yoga%20Tallahassee_0.pdf">Hot Yoga Tallahassee: A Case Study of Misogynistic Extremism</a>,&nbsp;which analyzes the background of a 2018 attacker who killed two women and injured four more at a yoga studio in Tallahassee, FL, and highlights the specific threat posed by misogynistic extremism.</li><li><strong>Research on Access to Services for Survivors of Cyberstalking</strong>. The Department of Justice Office on Violence Against Women has funded the National Opinion Research Center to collect nationally representative data on cyberstalking in the United States to assess its scope and nature, as well as determine survivors’ access to services and any unmet needs. Research is underway, and report findings will be published later this year.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Expanded Focus on Technological Abuse in the Reauthorized Violence Against Women Act.</strong>&nbsp;The Department of Justice (DOJ) will implement new statutory provisions in the recent reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) of 2022, which includes for the first time a definition of “technological abuse,” recognizing the importance of addressing this form of abuse at the intersection with domestic violence, sexual assault, stalking, and dating violence.&nbsp;&nbsp;Under VAWA 2022, the Attorney General will develop a national strategy to prevent and address cybercrimes against individuals, including cyberstalking and the non-consensual distribution of intimate images of adults, and directs the FBI to improve data collection regarding these crimes. DOJ will also help raise awareness among victim advocates of the new VAWA provision that establishes a federal civil cause of action for an individual who has an intimate visual depiction of themselves disclosed without their consent, with damages up to $150,000 and attorney’s fees.</li><li><strong>New Report on the Online Harassment of Women Political Figures.</strong>&nbsp;In partnership with&nbsp;the State Department&#8217;s Office of Global Women&#8217;s Issues,&nbsp;Texas A&amp;M University&#8217;s Program on Women, Peace, and Security&nbsp;are&nbsp;<a href="/bush.tamu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/WPS-Report-FINAL-draft.pdf">releasing a report</a>&nbsp;on &#8220;Technological Threats: How Online Harassment of Female Political Figures Undermines Democracy.&#8221; The report&nbsp;highlights research and policy&nbsp;on the intersection between online harassment, technology,&nbsp;women&#8217;s political participation, and democracy.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Expansion of the Global Partnership for Action on Gender-Based Online Harassment and Abuse.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;To address online harassment and abuse globally, the State Department will expand the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.state.gov/2022-roadmap-for-the-global-partnership-for-action-on-gender-based-online-harassment-and-abuse/">Global Partnership for Action</a>&nbsp;on Gender-Based Online Harassment and Abuse, announced at the Summit for Democracy in December and officially launched in March at the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women. The Global Partnership brings together countries, international organizations, civil society, and the private sector to better prioritize, understand, prevent, and address the growing scourge of technology-facilitated gender-based violence around the world. Since its launch, the Global Partnership has continued to grow its member countries, and recently welcomed the governments of Canada, Chile, and New Zealand, who joined the United States, along with Australia, Denmark, the Republic of Korea, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.</li></ul>

<p>This afternoon, President Biden hosted Speaker Pelosi and Leader Schumer to talk about their shared agenda of tackling inflation and lowering prices and transitioning from a historic economic recovery to stable, steady growth. Thanks to their shared leadership, we&#8217;ve seen unprecedented job and small business creation. They discussed their plans for fighting the global problem of inflation that is affecting every major economy, such as bringing down prescription drug and energy costs, and adding to the historic deficit reduction we have accomplished.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Via Teleconference</p>



<p>5:05 P.M. EDT</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Hello, everyone.&nbsp; Thank you so much for joining us this evening.&nbsp; Really appreciate you tuning in.<br><br>I just want to start this call with a quick reminder that this call is on background, embargoed until tomorrow morning at 5:00 a.m. Eastern.&nbsp; You may attribute the context of the call to a “senior administration official.”&nbsp; Today, you will hear from [senior administration officials].<br><br>And with that, I&#8217;ll kick it over to [senior administration official].</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Okay, I was muted.&nbsp; Am I unmuted?</p>



<p><br>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Yes, you&#8217;re back.<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; So sorry.&nbsp; Did you hear anything, because it seemed to do that and &#8212;<br><br>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Nope.<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Okay.<br><br>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Nope, we&#8217;re just starting.</p>



<p><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Okay, I&#8217;m going to start again then, with apologies.&nbsp; And good evening.<br><br>The President made a campaign promise to convene a national task force to prevent and address online harassment and abuse.&nbsp; And this task force is charged with developing recommendations for federal and state governments, for technology platforms, schools, and other public and private entities.<br><br>Tomorrow, the Vice President is going to host an event launching the task force, and she will be joined by Cabinet officials, advocates, and, most importantly, survivors.<br><br>The task force is &#8212; aims to address the growing problem of online harassment and abuse, which disproportionately targets women, girls, and LGBTQI+ people.<br><br>It will be co-chaired &#8212; the task force will be co-chaired by the Gender Policy Council and the National Security Council.&nbsp; And it includes the Attorney General, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and other heads of federal agencies and White House policy councils.<br><br>You know, just to take a step back about the “why” here, the President made this commitment because in the United States, one in three women under the age of 35 report being sexually harassed online, and over half of LGBTQI+ individuals report being the target of severe online abuse.<br><br>So what are we going to do?&nbsp; Within 180 days of launching, the task force is going to provide a blueprint for recommended steps the federal government can take to counter this issue, as well as suggestions for actions in partnership with the private sector and with civil society.&nbsp; And these recommendations will focus on increasing support for survivors of online harassment and abuse, as well as expanding research to better understand the impact and the scope of the problem, improve prevention efforts, and strengthen accountability for offenders and for platforms.<br><br>As you all well know, it&#8217;s imperative that we commit to better understanding and addressing the nexus between online misogyny and radicalization to violence.<br><br>You know, sadly, the &#8212; the recent mass shootings in Buffalo and Uvalde highlight these links between online harassment and abuse, hate, and extremist acts.&nbsp; The Buffalo shooter, for example, was very explicitly radicalized online.&nbsp; And his manifesto espoused the “great replacement theory,” which is, of course, rooted in racism, misogyny, and xenophobia.<br><br>And that&#8217;s just one example.&nbsp; We see this over and over again when we see issues of extremism and how they turn into violence.<br><br>The task force is just one element of the President and Vice President&#8217;s strong commitment to unify communities and to tackle hate and violent extremism in all its forms.<br><br>I&#8217;m going to turn this over now to [senior administration official].&nbsp; [Senior administration official], over to you.<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Thanks, [senior administration official].</p>



<p>So, as [senior administration official] just said, tomorrow, Vice President Harris will launch the White House Task Force to Address Online Harassment and Abuse, which the Gender Policy Council and the National Security Council will co-chair.&nbsp; We also note that the Attorney General, Merrick Garland, will be present, along with Surgeon General Vivek Murthy and Sloane Stephens, the U.S. Open Tennis Champion survivor and mental health advocate.<br><br>As [senior administration official] had noted, the task force, within 180 days, will provide a series of recommendations for how the federal government, in partnership with the private sector and civil society, can better combat online harassment and abuse.<br><br>And just to take a step back, the Vice President has had a long record, as many of you know, of standing up to hate and exploitation.&nbsp; From her days as Attorney General of California to her tenure in the U.S. Senate, and even starting out her career as a district attorney focused on sexual assault and child exploitation cases, she&#8217;s led the fight against bad actors and has pioneered innovative ways to secure safety and privacy rights in the digital world.<br><br>I&#8217;ll just focus on her attorney general record for a second.&nbsp; She successfully prosecuted one of the first-ever cases against tan operator of a cyber exploitation website.&nbsp; She also launched the Privacy Enforcement and Protection Unit to prosecute individuals who infringe on the privacy rights of others.&nbsp; This unit was the first of its kind for the California Department of Justice at the time.<br><br>Furthermore, as Attorney General, she secured an agreement with the leading operators of tech companies that have mobile application platforms to enhance privacy protections &#8212; basically, privacy agreements for millions of users on their smartphones, tablets, and other devices.<br><br>Her longstanding work in this area takes on an additional significance as the potential overruling of Roe may jeopardize data privacy.<br><br>As a senator, she introduced legislation that would have made these acts that we were just talking about a federal crime.&nbsp; So, she has led and will continue to lead the effort, along with the President, to dismantle cruelty, bullying, violence, and hate wherever it exists.<br><br>Back to you.<br><br>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Thank you so much, [senior administration officials].&nbsp; With that, we will take your questions.</p>



<p>Great.&nbsp; First question, we&#8217;ll turn it over to Chris with The AP.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, everybody.&nbsp; I just want to make sure I understand what&#8217;s happening tomorrow, specifically.&nbsp; It seems like what&#8217;s going to be happening tomorrow is the announcement of a task force that will eventually issue recommendations, not &#8212; we&#8217;re not going to get the recommendations tomorrow, if I understand that correctly.<br><br>And lastly, I just want to make sure I understand: What is the role of the National Security Council in this effort?&nbsp; And will we see Xavier Becerra there tomorrow, given HHS’s role?</p>



<p><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Thanks, Chris. &nbsp;So the answer your first question is: Yes, this is the launch of a task force.&nbsp; It&#8217;s actually &#8212; it&#8217;s also its first meeting.&nbsp; So what we will be doing is also hearing testimony from experts and survivors.&nbsp; And the meeting will be attended by a number of the different agencies and White House offices that are part of the task force.</p>



<p>We will not see Secretary Becerra because he&#8217;s not able to be there.&nbsp; But Surgeon General Murthy will attend in his place, as will Attorney General Garland.<br><br>The other question about the role of the National Security Council is: Yes, they will be co-chairing the council with us.&nbsp; And you know, the &#8212; the reason for that is the obvious connections.&nbsp; Two things &#8212; one is the obvious connection between online harassment and abuse and extremism, hate, and violent acts, and the threat that has caused.<br><br>One of the things that actually we will also be touching on tomorrow and announcing tomorrow is some research from the U.S. Secret Service’s National Threat Assessment Center under the Department of Homeland Security, which shows the nexus between online misogyny and domestic terrorism.&nbsp; So that just is one example of some additional things we will be announcing tomorrow.<br><br>And I feel like there was one more part of your question.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No, you got it.&nbsp; Just beyond that misogyny is connected to the Uvalde shooter that &#8212; that’s the connection there, right?<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Yes.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; That&#8217;s it.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p><br>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Thank you, Chris and [senior administration official].&nbsp;</p>



<p>Next, we&#8217;ll turn it over to Kellen with the New York Times.</p>



<p><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, thanks very much.&nbsp; I was just wondering, and I know this is going to be the first meeting, but is there any sense of whether there are particular online platforms or social media sites, anything like that, that you expect to be the focus of this task force?&nbsp; Is there any &#8212; any area in particular that you&#8217;re going to be focusing on?</p>



<p><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; We are not focused on particular platforms.&nbsp; We are absolutely focused on the role of platforms and social media more generally, and the connections and their role.&nbsp; And as I said at the &#8212; at the outset, there will be recommendations for the private sector and for civil society, but we&#8217;re not focused on any particular platform.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Got it.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p><br>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Next, we&#8217;ll go over to Cat with the Washington Post.</p>



<p><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey, thanks so much for taking the time to do this.&nbsp; I had two questions.&nbsp; Kind of following up on that, what role will major social media companies play in the task force and in the development of these recommendations?<br><br>And I also just wanted to ask you if you see any connection between the work the task force is doing and the work of the January 6th Committee on social media and extremism.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thank you.</p>



<p><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Sorry.&nbsp; So, you know, as I noted, preventing and addressing all forms of GBV &#8212; gender-based violence &#8212; including online requires engagement and, really, partnership between the public and the private sectors.&nbsp; And, you know, many technology companies have expressed a commitment to improving user safety and addressing abuse on their platforms.&nbsp;<br><br>And so, we will be looking for opportunities to engage with industry experts and leaders who share that commitment to supporting survivors and preventing abuse, including by improving the safety and the design of their products and platforms.<br><br>And I hadn&#8217;t, quite frankly, thought about the connection to January 6th.&nbsp; This was really &#8212; has been pretty laser-focused on online harassment and abuse and the connection to gender-based violence.</p>



<p><br>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Thanks, [senior administration official].&nbsp;<br><br>Next, we&#8217;ll turn it over to Alexandra with Reuters.<br><br>Alexandra, I don&#8217;t know if &#8212; we can&#8217;t hear you.<br><br>Okay, in the meantime, we&#8217;ll turn it over to Ashley with Axios.</p>



<p><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, there.&nbsp; Thanks for having the call.&nbsp; You talked about ultimately developing best practices with civil society and the private sector, but will you &#8212; will the task force be making any policy recommendations for Congress with the federal agencies?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; We do anticipate making policy recommendations, as well as recommendations on additional research on the role of, as I said, private sector and civil society and programs.<br><br>And again, there will be a couple of additional announcements tomorrow.&nbsp; And so, that sort of forecasts, because, honestly, we&#8217;ve already started this work.&nbsp; And this task force is really the next thing in the line of working on all facets of this &#8212; of this problem and the solutions to it.&nbsp; So, yes, I would say, in all of those categories.</p>



<p><br>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Next question, we&#8217;ll turn it over to Brendan at Politico.</p>



<p><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; Hi, guys.&nbsp; Thanks so much for doing the call. &nbsp;You know, I think particularly given, you know, it sounds like the involvement of the DOJ and the National Security Council and folks like that, I wanted to ask whether the White House has given any thought to privacy or, you know, like free speech concerns around this?&nbsp;<br><br>You know, I&#8217;m thinking specifically of sort of the backlash that occurred around DHS’s disinformation board, and I can imagine some of the same voices might raise concerns with this effort, you know, regarding the White House or the government&#8217;s attempt to sort of, like, control speech online that some people might see as obviously hate speech or harassment or threatening violence and others might not see that way.<br><br>Are you guys thinking about those issues at all?&nbsp; And is that something that has crossed the White House&#8217;s radar so far?&nbsp; And do you guys plan to sort of dig into those issues at all, as you &#8212; as you weigh a lot of these other questions?</p>



<p><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Yes, we are particularly focused on online activities that are illegal conduct, such as cyber stalking or non-consensual distribution of intimate images or targeted harassment, as well as, you know, the overlap with intimate partner and sexual violence online, and online abuse linked to the distribution of child sex abuse material and trafficking.<br><br>And these are obviously harmful and illegal acts that occur online.&nbsp; And there has been a strong bipartisan consensus that more has to be done to hold perpetrators and platforms accountable to prevent these harms.<br><br>We are very mindful of the of the First Amendment issues.&nbsp; But, you know, violent and threatening speech is not protected by the First Amendment.&nbsp; So, while we are going to carefully navigate those issues, we&#8217;re also going to remain laser-focused on the non-speech aspects.&nbsp; So, yes, that will be part of our work.<br><br>And I realized I actually forgot to mention &#8212; you raised the National Security Council again, and I did realize there was one other piece I wanted to respond to in Chris&#8217;s question, which is: Why is the National Security Council involved?&nbsp; For all the reasons we&#8217;ve already discussed.&nbsp; And also, I should just note that another thing we are doing is that the &#8212; the National Security Council and we launched a Global Partnership for Action on Gender-Based Online Harassment and Abuse at the Summit for Democracy back in December, and sort of officially asked for partners at the U.N. Commission on the Status of Women in March.<br><br>And so, the State Department is continuing to expand that global partnership because, obviously, this work is important in a number of different countries around the world.&nbsp; So, that partnership &#8212; the Global Partnership &#8212; brings together countries and international organizations and civil society and the private sector to understand technology-facilitated gender-based violence around the world and to prevent and address it.</p>



<p><br>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Thank you, [senior administration official].&nbsp;</p>



<p>And our last question, we&#8217;ll go to Tal at the SF Chronicle.</p>



<p><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, I have a quick procedural question and then an actual question.&nbsp; The procedural question is: Will you all be distributing a copy of the report you mentioned, tying misogyny to violence?<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Our goal is to have a factsheet under a 5:00 a.m. embargo tonight.&nbsp; So we&#8217;ll make sure everyone on this call gets that.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay, great.&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; And then my question &#8212; you know, and I mean this with all due respect, but if this is a campaign promise, you know, we&#8217;re 18 months into the administration, I believe, you know, it&#8217;s &#8212; you&#8217;re announcing a task force that in six months will give recommendations that, of course, will then need to be enacted.<br><br>I&#8217;m just wondering, you know: What took so long to stand up the task force?&nbsp; And, you know, should we take away a sense of urgency from, you know, this coming together, kind of, over such a long time?</p>



<p><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; What I would say about that is that this is, you know, sort of a midpoint in the work on online harassment and abuse.&nbsp; And I think, you know, [senior administration official] laid out the Vice President&#8217;s long commitment to this.<br><br>You know, I&#8217;m sure you know the President&#8217;s long commitment to gender-based violence wherever it occurs.&nbsp; And, you know, between passing the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act and taking on military sexual assault and, you know, other issues that are related, this is just part of our overall work to combat gender-based violence wherever it occurs.<br><br>And, you know, what has &#8212; the way that this task force has developed &#8212; and I&#8217;m sort of quite proud of the fact that it&#8217;s, I think, a very thoughtful group of people who are involved &#8212; and the issues are sort of well-defined at this point is because it grows out of interagency work, which has been ongoing.<br><br>So, as I said, this is a public acknowledgement of the work that we are doing and, sort of, you know, the moment to say, “Okay, we&#8217;ve been doing all of this interagency work.”&nbsp; This brings it together, and that we&#8217;re asking for this report back within 180 days.</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Thank you so much.&nbsp; And thanks, everyone, for joining.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just a friendly reminder that this is under embargo until 5:00 a.m. tomorrow morning.&nbsp; We&#8217;ll be sure to share the factsheet, hopefully in the next few hours here.&nbsp; And please reach out with any questions.</p>
