<p class="has-text-align-center">Aboard Air Force One<br>En Route New York, New York</p>



<p>11:36 A.M. EST<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I know this is a short flight, so I thought I would just start.&nbsp; And I know we&#8217;ve done a number of briefings, but just giving you all just a couple of key points on the President&#8217;s engagement in the operation that happened overnight last night.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The operation has been months in &#8212; was months in planning.&nbsp; The President was first briefed on this operation in depth over a month ago by the actual operational commanders.&nbsp; He was regularly updated by the national security team on the planning details of this operation, to include a briefing in the Oval Office on Monday.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last night, the President monitored key aspects of the operation in real time in the White House Situation Room.&nbsp; I think you all saw the photo that we released on that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also want to stress that the President directed the Department of Defense to take every precaution to minimize noncombatant casualties in the operation, hence how they proceeded with their &#8212; the operation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, as we know and we saw, ISIS once again revealed its barbarity in a final act of cowardice, and displaying a never-ending &#8212; ended &#8212; disregard for innocent lives.&nbsp; Hajji Abdullah detonated an explosive device shortly after U.S. forces arrived on site, killing himself, a woman, and three children.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, there will be more assessments.&nbsp; I mean, the Department of Defense will do an assessment, as they always do.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But just wanted to outline that at the top.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know we also did a briefing on the trip today to New York, but why don&#8217;t we get to your questions?</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; Two subjects.&nbsp; First, obviously, news of the day.&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Big picture: Strategically, what does this mean for U.S.?&nbsp; What does this mean for the Islamic State?&nbsp; And what does this mean for Syria?</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And did you coordinate or communicate with Russia at all, given the airspace issues in Syria?</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Let me start with the first question.&nbsp; Hajji Abdullah’s death delivers a catastrophic blow to ISIS and shows that the United States will take out terrorist threats no matter where they stand to hide in the world &#8212; try to hide in the world.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last night&#8217;s effective action took a major terrorist leader off the battlefield and makes it clear that we will hold anyone accountable who seeks to harm Americans at home or around the world.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would also note that while this planning was taking place, of course, we were also leading a coordinated effort, as you all know &#8212; more than 200 engagements with leaders around the world &#8212; to stand up for the sovereign &#8212; the territorial integrity of Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so, it shows the competence of U.S. leadership, the effectiveness of U.S. leadership, and our ability to keep the American people safe while also standing up for our values at the same time.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In terms of international coordination, it&#8217;s a good question.&nbsp; I will have to check with the State Department on the specifics of it.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was there a video component to the scene unfolding in the Situation Room?&nbsp; And who else was in there with him?</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I&#8217;m sure I can get you a complete list.&nbsp; I know some individuals were shown in the photo we released.&nbsp; Members of his national security team were there, including Jake Sullivan and Liz Sherwood-Randall.&nbsp; I think you could see John Finer in the photo.&nbsp; Obviously, the Vice President.&nbsp; We will venture to get you a full list of attendees.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, can you &#8212; on the trip today, there was some reporting by the New York Times that the White House is trying to move more to the center when it comes to crime, and there’s concern about reaching out to police organizations.&nbsp; And obviously, there’s a policing executive order that’s supposed to be in the works.&nbsp; Can you talk a bit about: Is there a conflict between civil rights groups who want more accountability for police, want less use of force unnecessarily, and what the White House is doing right now, like on this trip?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would say, first, we would direct the &#8212; reject the notion that we were moving into any political direction.&nbsp; The President has a decades-long record of fighting &#8212; of being an advocate for fighting crime and supporting local COPS programs with necessary and appropriate resources and funding.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>He has never been an advocate for defunding the police, as you know, but his record on these issues long precedes his time as President.<br><br>I would say that he is also committed and he believes that both need to come hand in hand &#8212; that pursuing police reform is a step that will help rebuild trust in communities and is something that is welcomed by many communities and police forces across the country, and he believes that goes in hand with public safety.&nbsp; Having effective, accountable community policing to help us &#8212; helps us fight crime, and it also makes us safer.&nbsp;<br><br>So, while we are here in New York, what you will hear him talk about today, as we&#8217;ve previewed a little bit, is his, you know, decades-long commitment to supporting law enforcement, to ensuring that communities have the resources they need too.&nbsp;<br><br>And you&#8217;ll hear him talk about his sweeping and comprehensive plan to adjust gun frime [sic] &#8212; gun crime and our focus on implementing that, but also, again, ensuring that communities have the funding that they need, including his proposal to double federal support for community policing with $300 million more for cities, plus another $200 [million] more for community violence intervention program.&nbsp;<br><br>But you will also hear him &#8212; and he also remains very committed to taking steps we can to put in place police reform measures that he thinks are long overdue.&nbsp; Obviously, his preference was to have had that through legislative processes, but we are looking at what can be done through executive actions.&nbsp;<br><br>I think you may have seen Susan Rice convey we’re not close on that front, but we are working on it.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, we’ve had six law enforcement officers killed by criminals this year.&nbsp; The President has not spoken out forcefully against any of these attacks.&nbsp; Even some of his supporters say the lack of forceful condemnation is demoralizing to police.&nbsp; Why hasn&#8217;t he spoken out more forcefully against these attacks?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; More forcefully against attacks against police officers?<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; He went and gave an entire speech to the &#8212; to the police forces just a few months ago.&nbsp; He &#8212; we have put out statements, and he has condemned the violence and the attacks on these police officers.&nbsp; He&#8217;s reached out to family members.&nbsp; He is somebody &#8212;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But why not (inaudible) &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Let me finish my answer, because I think that&#8217;s an inaccurate characterization.&nbsp; And you haven&#8217;t even given me names of who you&#8217;re talking about.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, Charles Wilson is &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; But the President’s &#8212;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; (inaudible) of the National Association &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; &#8212; the President&#8217;s record &#8212;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; of Black Law Enforcement Officers.&nbsp; He’s one of the people who said it&#8217;s demoralizing.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; The President&#8217;s record is very clear here.&nbsp; He has a long record of advocating for, supporting through funding, through speaking out, the role of local police, of national police and the important role they place &#8212; they play in addressing crime and keeping communities safe.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why not go to one of the officer’s funerals, if you&#8217;re going to come to New York, and show support for the law enforcement?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; The President &#8212; we have been planning this trip in coordination with the mayor&#8217;s office.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve invited a number of officials to attend the trip.&nbsp; He also is, as you know, going to the police headquarters to make clear his strong support for them.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, I know you gave a little bit of the lead-up to the raid.&nbsp; I mean, can you give more on the President&#8217;s thinking ahead of the ISIS raid?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I can, but tell me more about what you mean.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I just mean like &#8212; well, you know, a little bit more from either inside the room &#8212; I know it’s the Situation Room, but like &#8212; or what the President was thinking as this &#8212; as this raid was taking place.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I think the President, again, has been &#8212; received a number of briefings, as I noted, from his national security team over the course of the last several weeks, including one from the operational commanders just a few days ago.&nbsp; And the President was thinking: We got to go after terrorists wherever they are and get them, and protect the American people.&nbsp; He also was &#8212; made clear and reiterated this at every point in the process, to do everything we can to avoid civilian casualties.&nbsp;<br><br>So, I think you saw the photo of him in the room.&nbsp; You&#8217;re always watc- &#8212; in those moments, you&#8217;re always watching, you&#8217;re thinking about the bravery and the courage of the &#8212; of the service members who are on the ground, you know, implementing an operation.&nbsp; And that is, of course, front and center from him &#8212; for him always.&nbsp;<br><br>But, you know, he was also thinking about, you know, the role he plays as Commander-in-Chief in keeping the country safe.&nbsp; And, certainly, taking out the current head of ISIS is a big step forward in that.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you guys have a number on how many civilian casualties there were?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; There &#8212; again, that is an assessment being done by DOD.&nbsp; I would note that &#8212; as was confirmed and I just confirmed again &#8212; that, given that the intended target self-detonated and deployed a tactic used by his predecessor, that that shows, again, the brutality of ISIS &#8212; and killed his own family.<br><br>We certainly know the facts of that, but I will leave it to DOD to give any additional assessments.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And if I could, just on USICA.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are a number of House Democrats and Senate Democrats that really want to see this done by the President’s State of the Union Address.&nbsp; Are you &#8212; do you guys just want to see the House pass the Senate version of the bill, given that this &#8212; the House version is taking a lot longer with all of these amendments?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, we&#8217;re not going to make a calculation or direction of that from here.&nbsp; As you know, the process &#8212; how it works &#8212; is: Once it passes the House, it would &#8212; we would expect it would go to conference and there would be a discussion about any disagreements or any final details that are not aligned between the two pieces of legislation.<br><br>That&#8217;s a normal part of legislating.&nbsp;&nbsp;And we certainly support that.&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, the President has said he wants to sign it as quickly as possible.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few things.&nbsp;&nbsp;Were you in the room last night &#8212; the Situation Room?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp;&nbsp;No.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s start with this one &#8212; today&#8217;s event.&nbsp; The governor is there as well.&nbsp; This is an official event, but is this an endorsement of her reelection &#8212; of her election campaign?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I think this is an event and an opportunity.&nbsp; The President is a big fan of the governor, but this is not a political event.&nbsp; This is an event for the President to stand with leaders in New York as they&#8217;ve seen, you know, the tragic deaths of a number of police officers recently &#8212; people who have been serving on behalf of communities across New York &#8212; and also for the President to make clear he stands with them in their efforts to address crime in their communities.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two others from last night.&nbsp; Was he able to watch the whole thing live?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have a detail of how &#8212; of that.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And were any of &#8212; any members of the special forces team who conducted last night&#8217;s raid involved in the Baghdadi operation?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I would point you to the Department of Defense on that.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There&#8217;s a meeting today &#8212; remind me &#8212; today with Presidents Putin and Xi &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; in China.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How do we feel about that meeting and not being invited to it?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; There are diplomatic meetings that happen all the time. &nbsp;Our National Security Advisor, I believe, just recently spoke with his counterpart.&nbsp; Let me just get all the specific details on this so I can make sure it&#8217;s accurate for you.<br><br>And, you know, our view and assessment is that &#8212; oh, I should say &#8212; sorry &#8212; Secretary Blinken recently spoke to China&#8217;s Foreign Minister Wang, his counterpart, and underscored the global security and economic risk posed by further Russian aggression against Ukraine and conveyed that de-escalation and diplomacy are the responsible way forward.&nbsp;<br><br>You know, that is the message we continue to convey, including the fact that a destabilizing conflict in Europe would impact China&#8217;s interests all over the world.&nbsp; China certainly know that.&nbsp;<br><br>But we have our own means of communicating through counterparts.&nbsp; We&#8217;ll continue to do that and continue to stand up for what we feel should be global values.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And on the Supreme Court, any update on when he might begin interviewing potential nominees?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I&#8217;m not going to provide an update on the process from here.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey.&nbsp; Hey, Jen, two things on Congress.&nbsp; It seems like, on the Russia sanctions negotiations, that Congress is intent to at least include some preemptive sanctions into that bill.&nbsp; Is that a red line for you?&nbsp; Or could you ultimately support something that has preemptive &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We have done some sanctions in advance already.&nbsp; Our approach &#8212; and we are in very close touch with members of Congress about this legislation, which I don&#8217;t think has been formally even proposed yet.&nbsp; So, we are in close contact, in conversations with them.&nbsp;<br><br>Our approach from the beginning has been based on our belief that, you know, the crippling economic sanctions package that we have been discussing and has been underway in our interagency process, which we briefed Congress on, is a &#8212; has a deterrent &#8212; could have a deterrent impact as we&#8217;re already seeing in the Russian markets.&nbsp;<br><br>But we&#8217;ve never set a red line.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not setting a red line.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve done sanctions in advance, and we&#8217;re in discussion with Congress about the legislation.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, on the approps talks ongoing right now, can you detail a little bit about the White House&#8217;s engagement in them?&nbsp; And do you support larger increases to the defense budgets to get Republicans on board?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Those talks are being &#8212; we&#8217;re closely engaged with them from the White House, from our OMB team.&nbsp; But I&#8217;m not going to detail specifics of those behind-the-scenes talks at this point.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Russia &#8212;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And any &#8212; sorry, one more, Steve.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No, go right ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any fear that the ongoing talks now will further delay your budget for next year, which I think Shalanda Young said is coming past the State of the Union?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have any assessment of that.&nbsp; I know she confirmed that just a couple of days ago, so &#8212; but I don&#8217;t have a new timeline beyond that.&nbsp; That&#8217;s my understanding of where it stands at this point.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, if Russia and Belarus are having some military exercises, is this any cause for concern?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; You know, we&#8217;ve raised &#8212; our U.N. Ambassador, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, raised some concerns about this when she spoke at the United Nations, where she talked about her concern about &#8212; our concern about 5,000 troops in Belarus, the potential for 30- &#8212; up to 30,000 more.&nbsp; Clearly, this is an escalatory, not a de-escalatory action.&nbsp;<br><br>And certainly, we look at &#8212; look at, you know, these developments as we make assessments about how to support and work with our other NATO partners in the region.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With regard to the civilian casualties in Syria, are &#8212; is the administration saying that they were caused entirely by the bomb detonating or by crossfire from the one lieutenant engaging with U.S. forces?&nbsp; Like, what &#8212; give us some clarity on that.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Obviously, these events just happened overnight.&nbsp; And so, I&#8217;m going to let the Department of Defense do a final assessment, which I&#8217;m certain they will provide additional detail on once it&#8217;s finalized.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, will there be any, like, evidence or, like, release to support the idea &#8212; I mean, I know the U.S. has put out its statement that, you know, they detonated the bomb themselves.&nbsp; But will the U.S. provide any evidence?&nbsp; Because there may be people that are skeptical of the events that took place and what happened to the civilians.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Skeptical of the U.S. military&#8217;s assessment when they went and took out an ISIS terror- &#8212; the leader of ISIS?<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; That they are not providing accurate information &#8212;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; &#8212; and ISIS is providing accurate information?<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, not ISIS, but, I mean, the U.S. has not always been straightforward about what happens with civilians.&nbsp; And, I mean, that is a fact.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, as you know, there&#8217;s an extensive process that the Department of Defense undergoes.&nbsp; The President made clear from the beginning, at every point in this process, that doing everything possible to avoid civilian casualties was his priority and his preference.<br><br>I just reconfirmed, and I think our national security colleague who did a briefing this morning also reiterated, that the individual who was the target detonated himself, killing his entire family.<br><br>Given these events just happened less than 24 hours ago, we&#8217;re going to give them time to make a final assessment.&nbsp; And they&#8217;ll provide every detail they can.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Civil rights advocates have asked the President to visit Rikers Island.&nbsp; I know that&#8217;s not on this trip.&nbsp; Can you speak to why this isn&#8217;t on the trip?&nbsp; And is there a plan for the President to visit Rikers Island anytime soon?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have any trips to preview at this point in time.&nbsp; Obviously, this trip today, which is a full trip, including the President&#8217;s visit to thank law enforcement officials, to convey clearly to them that he has their back, that he is going to continue to support adequate funding and resources that they need to keep their community safe, and also to meet, of course, with leaders in the state who have shared concerns about rising crime.<br><br>But, you know, I expect he&#8217;ll be back to New York, you know, during his time as President, but I don&#8217;t have any preview of a trip to Rikers.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One thing, Jen.&nbsp; Do you have any updates on the German Chancellor visit &#8212; if you&#8217;re planning a press conference or anything to share on the details?&nbsp; Or &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I believe we are, but let me see if I can get the final details for all of you.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We’re about to land, just so you know.<br><br>11:52 A.M. EST</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">The U.S. Capitol Visitor Center<br>Washington, D.C.</p>



<p>9:06 A.M. EST</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Well, thank you.&nbsp; Thank you, thank you, thank you.&nbsp; I &#8212; I don&#8217;t know who she&#8217;s talking about &#8212; (laughter) &#8212; but thank you.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Folks, look, let me say &#8212; I hadn’t planned on &#8212; I didn’t know I was going to get that kind of introduction.&nbsp; But let me say at the outset that, you know, we&#8217;ve all gone through really difficult times &#8212; every one of you out there &#8212; one way or another.&nbsp; And I had an overwhelming advantage, and I mean it sincerely.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I had a family that was there for me every single, solitary moment.&nbsp; And so, I don’t deserve this credit for enduring that so many people I meet &#8212; think of all the people you know, whether they&#8217;re constituents or friends or relatives, who get up every morning, don’t have anybody &#8212; don’t have anybody, and they put one foot in front of the other, and they do it.&nbsp; They lost a child, they lost a mother, a father, a husband, someone close to them &#8212; just plucked away &#8212; and they get up every single day and put one foot in front of the other.&nbsp; And they&#8217;re the people who deserve our recognition and our credit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I &#8212; I think I&#8217;ve talked to Bill and Grace Nelson about this: The only thing &#8212; today is my son Beau’s birthday.&nbsp; But the only thing that Beau said to me when he was &#8212; we were told he was &#8212; he was going to die within minutes or &#8212; if an hour &#8212; that he looked at me, and he said, “Dad, promise me &#8212; promise me, Dad, you&#8217;re going to stay involved.”&nbsp; I said, “I&#8217;ll be involved.&nbsp; I’ll be &#8212; I’ll be good, Beau.”&nbsp; He said, “No, dad, promise me.&nbsp; Give me your word as a Biden that you&#8217;re going to stay engaged.”</p>



<p>Because he knew, like a lot of you &#8212; what you’ve been through &#8212; the first instinct is you just want to curl up in a ball and just leave, no longer do what you’ve done your whole life that you’ve &#8212;</p>



<p>He said, “Dad &#8212; Dad, promise me.”&nbsp; “I give my word.”</p>



<p>And that &#8212; that was the last conversation in Walter Reed Hospital &#8212; laying there in the bed.&nbsp; And &#8212; and then he looked at me and he said, “And, Dad…” &#8212; and his brother Hunter was his closest friend.&nbsp; We were all three on the bed.&nbsp; And he turned to me and he said, “Dad, I want you to know I&#8217;m not afraid.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, you know, I had so much help &#8212; so much help, starting from the time that I lost my wife and daughter in an accident.&nbsp; But look, everybody has got horrible things they’ve had to deal with.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And we&#8217;ve watched them &#8212; I sat in the Senate for 36 years.&nbsp; We watched people literally die in our midst.&nbsp; I remember that scene where Teddy walked out.&nbsp; Or &#8212; I mean, there &#8212; so, you know, I&#8217;m flattered that you think as highly of me as you stated, Kirsten, but I had &#8212; I had a lot of help.&nbsp; I had a lot of help.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I want to thank you for the intr- &#8212; the introduction.&nbsp; It’s very gracious.&nbsp; But like I said, there&#8217;s a lot more people who’ve done a lot more.</p>



<p>And to my good friend Chris Coons &#8212; two things I tell everybody about Chris Coons you got to know: One, he’s smarter than you.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; And, two, the boy can preach.&nbsp; He’s the only guy that went to law school and got a divinity degree at the same time.&nbsp; I worry about “divine” lawyers.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; But &#8212; anyway.</p>



<p>Chris, thank you.&nbsp; You’ve been a great friend.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And as &#8212; Bryan, as you were speaking, Chuck sort of leaned over; he didn’t say anything, but he just like, “Was that Delaware?”&nbsp; But it was Delaware.&nbsp; It’s why I got involved in politics in the first place.</p>



<p>I remember sitting on &#8212; going to a little Catholic grade school in Claymont, Delaware, which was a steel town that was dying.&nbsp; And the bus would go &#8212; my mother would drive me to the school parking lot &#8212; it was called Holy Rosary School &#8212; from a little &#8212; and it was called Brookview Apartments.&nbsp; Used to be Section 8 housing later.</p>



<p>And I get out of the bus &#8212; I get out of the car.&nbsp; And this is where I-95 runs parallel to these days.&nbsp; And I said, “Mom, why are all those kids” &#8212; it was then “colored.”&nbsp; “Why are all those colored kids in that bus?”&nbsp; Because in Scranton there weren&#8217;t any &#8212; there were very few Blacks.&nbsp; She said, “They’re not allowed to go to school with us here, in Delaware.” &nbsp;So, you know &#8212; and Milton wasn’t what you might call the epicenter of desegregation.</p>



<p>And so, you’ve been through a lot, but you’ve done a lot as well.&nbsp; And I thank you.</p>



<p>And, Kari &#8212; Kari Jobe, you have the voice of an angel, kid.&nbsp; I tell you what: You really do.&nbsp; And that guy sitting next to you, he’s a lucky guy.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; He’s a lucky guy.&nbsp; And besides, he’s got all his hair.&nbsp; (Laughter.) &nbsp;</p>



<p>And Vice President Harris, Majority Leader Schumer, Mitch McConnell &#8212; and, Mitch, I don’t want to hurt your reputation, but we really are friends.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; And that is not an epiphany we’re having here at the moment.&nbsp; We’ve always &#8212; you’ve always done exactly what you’ve said.&nbsp; You’re a man of word &#8212; of your word, and you’re a man of honor.&nbsp; Thank you for being my friend.</p>



<p>And, folks, members of Congress and spouses: I’m honored to join you all today.</p>



<p>You know, we’re keeping our prayers for Senator Luján, and keep him in your prayers today.&nbsp; I think, from what I understand, he’s going to be okay and be back with us in the not-too-distant future.&nbsp; But we pray for a safe recovery.</p>



<p><a>And a special thank you to the bipartisan chairs of this breakfast: Representative Lamb and Walberg, [Senators] Gillibrand and Rounds.</a></p>



<p>Mike, I know it’s been three months to this day that you lost Jean to cancer.&nbsp; So, you know &#8212; you know of which I speak.&nbsp; And it’s like losing a piece of your soul.&nbsp; And I &#8212; you know, I &#8212; I remember.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, as I said, is a day that a lot of us can remember the times when we lost &#8212; each of us.&nbsp; And just like I miss my son every single day, I &#8212; there’s &#8212; I know he’s always with me, for real.&nbsp; He’s always with me.</p>



<p>Congresswoman McBath, just like your precious son Jordan &#8212; he’s always going to be with you, for real.&nbsp; It becomes a piece of you.&nbsp; You know, how many times did you all been through this, about to make a decision and say, “What would Beau want?”&nbsp; Or “What would Jill want?”&nbsp; Or “What would…” &#8212; you know, whatever it is.&nbsp; So, it’s &#8212; you know.</p>



<p>And for everyone out there who has lost a piece of their soul, they’re always with you.&nbsp; And all through the pain, I think you &#8212; if you can find purpose, find purpose.&nbsp; Purpose of a life that makes you worthy in their eyes and what they expect of you.</p>



<p>This breakfast usually is held in a big Washington hotel with a big crowd.</p>



<p>Today, we’re here in the Visitor Center of the United States Capitol with a much smaller crowd, a more intimate setting to see each other here and listen to each other &#8212; standing in this, which is, in governmental terms, a “sacred place.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>I thank our &#8212; I think about our former colleagues and close friends we lost this year: Bob Dole; Harry Reid; Johnny Isakson, who was a hell of guy; Max Cleland; Carl Levin; Mike Enzi; John Warner; and Walter Mondale.</p>



<p>And, you know, I learned a long time ago: Never make one good eulogy.&nbsp; Because if you make one good eulogy, you got to do a lot of eulogies.&nbsp; But I’ve had the pleasure of knowing their families. &nbsp;And &#8212; and there’s a lot of good friends, both sides of the aisle, who disagreed on many, many things, who still talked and listened to one another.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think I’ve said to Mitch and some of you earlier, in the last couple of years, that, you know, one of the things I don’t know for sure but I think is missing in the Congress is we don’t spend as much time with one another as we used to.&nbsp; We used to eat lunch together.&nbsp; I mean, literally sit down &#8212; not in the Senate Dining Room of the Senate or that small dining room off to the &#8212; right across the hall from the visitors dining room, and there were those two big round tables &#8212; big &#8212; big dining room tables and a buffet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I remember when I first got here, after my wife and daughter were killed in an accident, my boys were still in the hospital &#8212; and I remember Teddy would always come and say, “Come to lunch.”&nbsp; I didn’t want any part of going to lunch.&nbsp; And one day, he just dragged me over to lunch.&nbsp; He said, “You’ll learn more there than at any place else.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I would go to lunch there, literally every day, and listen to the senior members.&nbsp; And you learn about their losses, their happiness.&nbsp; You learn about them.&nbsp; You learn about their &#8212;</p>



<p>You know, I remember one day I walked in and there was a little corner in the table &#8212; or a corner table, when the big table was filled.&nbsp; And I sat down.&nbsp; And Jimmy said, “Come over here, Joe.&nbsp; Sit down here.”&nbsp; And I wasn’t about to sit in John Stennis’s seat, because he sat at the head of the table.&nbsp; And he said, “No, come on.&nbsp; He’s gone.”&nbsp; So, I ordered my hamburger or whatever (inaudible) and took a couple of bites.&nbsp; And in walks John Stennis.&nbsp; And I immediately put a napkin on all my stuff and I said, “I’m finished Mr. Chairman.&nbsp; Come on.&nbsp; Right here.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>I later got a handwritten letter from him, about three o’clock in the afternoon: “I appreciate the honor of you recognizing my seat, but you didn’t finish your meal.&nbsp; I promise this favor will be returned.”</p>



<p>He not only returned, he actually endorsed me when I ran for President from Mississippi.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; And I think &#8212; that was an expensive hamburger for him.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>But I guess what I’m trying to say is: You know, when you know one another, when you know &#8212; and no matter how badly you disagree &#8212; and people think, Rev, that in the days as divided here, we had &#8212; we had a lot of flat-out, old segregationists still in our caucus.&nbsp; But Teddy Kennedy would argue like hell with Jim Eastland, and then he’d go down to have lunch.&nbsp; Didn’t agree with one another, but they treated each other with respect even in that day.</p>



<p>And I &#8212; I just think that, when you learn that another man or woman &#8212; and you’re flying a codel, and someone has their husband or wife with them, and you learn that they have a kid with a problem with alcoholism, or you learn that they have a daughter who is &#8212; has breast cancer.&nbsp; You learn that they have &#8212; it’s hard to dislike the person.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so, one of the things I pray for &#8212; and I mean it &#8212; is that we sort of get back to the place &#8212; and it’s so busy; I think things have changed so much &#8212; but that we get to really know each other.&nbsp; It’s hard to really dislike someone when you know what they’re going through is the same thing you’re going through.</p>



<p>You know, like President Eisenhower, the first president to attend this breakfast 70 years ago &#8212; at the time, President Eisenhower said &#8212; he said, “There&#8217;s a need we all have in these days and times for some help which comes from outside ourselves.”&nbsp; Outside ourselves.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve attended many of these prayer breakfasts over the years &#8212; with our nation at war, in struggle, in strife, peace, in times of prosperity, when everybody was getting on, but a nation in prayer.</p>



<p>Jill and I have been humbled by the prayers of so many of you, and it means everything to us.&nbsp; We pray for our nation as we face an inflection point in our history.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So much is going to change no matter who&#8217;s sitting in my job.&nbsp; The world is changing.&nbsp; The world is changing.</p>



<p>I &#8212; there’s a &#8212; the moment &#8212; but there&#8217;s also a moment of great progress, of lives saved in this pandemic, not just the ones lost &#8212; new jobs created for people, new hope for rebuilding the nation, but also a moment of pain for the lost lives and the &#8212; and the lives lost in this pandemic.&nbsp; And the cruel twist of fates that occur.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You know, at a moment of great division of our democracy is at great &#8212; grave risk.&nbsp; I pray that we follow what Jesus taught us: to serve rather than be served.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t always do it.&nbsp; I hope try.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t always do it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I pray to keep the faith.&nbsp; That very promise of America, believing that there&#8217;s nothing we can&#8217;t do, where every person is created equal in the image of God &#8212; no matter who or where we come from, who we are, or what our color, or how we choose to pray, or whether or not we choose to pray &#8212; they deserve to be treated equally throughout their lives.</p>



<p>Faith in the very idea of America that can be defined, in my view, by a single word.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve been saying this for over 30 years.&nbsp; When I get asked to define America, one word: “Possibilities.”&nbsp; “Possibilities.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the reasons why other countries sometimes think we&#8217;re arrogant is we believe anything is possible.&nbsp; Anything is possible.&nbsp; And faith in the American people will prove each and every day we&#8217;re a great nation because we&#8217;re, at our heart, a good people.&nbsp; We do bad things when we get frightened.</p>



<p>Saint Augustine wrote that, “A people was a multitude defined by a common object of their love.”&nbsp; I believe the common objects of our love that define us as Americans are opportunity, liberty, dignity, respect, honor, service, truth &#8212; things everybody recognizes both here and around the world.</p>



<p>As I stand in this citadel of democracy that was attacked one year ago, the issue is &#8212; for us is unity.&nbsp; How do we unite us again?&nbsp; Unity is elusive, but it&#8217;s really actually necessary.&nbsp; Unity doesn&#8217;t mean we have to agree on everything.&nbsp; But unity is where enough of us &#8212; enough of us believe in a core of basic things: the common good, the general welfare, a faith in the United States of America &#8212; the United States of America.</p>



<p>Nearly three weeks ago, we were reminded of that truth.&nbsp; A gunman entered a synagogue in Colleyville, Texas.&nbsp; He took four worshippers hostage, including a rabbi, for 11 hours.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But violence and vengeance didn’t pierce the goodness and grace of that scene.&nbsp; Heroic law enforcement officers were joined by local faith leaders, including an imam, a Baptist minister who offered their help.&nbsp; A nearby Catholic church opened its doors for the hostages’ families.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At sunset, a group of Muslim women &#8212; friends of the rabbi’s wife &#8212; walked in with one of the rabbi’s favorite foods.&nbsp; They hugged and they wept.</p>



<p>Because of the bravery of the hostages and the law enforcement officers, the hostages were &#8212; escaped safely, and the families were reunit- &#8212; reunited.</p>



<p>When asked later if he would change anything, the rabbi said, quote, “We will do what we always do, which is the best we can.” &nbsp;“Which is the best we can.”&nbsp; I had a long conversation with the rabbi.&nbsp; It was interesting to hear him describe the scene and how faith mattered: Whether you’re in a synagogue or a church or a mosque or a temple, whether you’re religious or not, we’re all imperfect human beings, trying our best &#8212; the best we can, because we can&#8217;t know the future.&nbsp; We can&#8217;t know what&#8217;s coming.&nbsp; But we also can&#8217;t live in fear every step of the way.</p>



<p>That’s America.&nbsp; From darkness, we found joy, hope, and light.</p>



<p>Rather than driving us apart, faith can move us together.&nbsp; Because all the great confessional faiths have the same fundamental basic beliefs: not just faith in a higher power, but faith to see each other as we should: not as enemies, but as neighbors; not as adversaries, but as fellow Americans.</p>



<p>And as leaders of this nation who work and pray together, there is an oath to God and country to uphold and a charge to keep: to stand in the breach and to protect our democracy, to work together to right wrongs. &nbsp;That’s why we all came here, to make the most of our time on Earth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For if a house divided cannot stand, surely a house united can do anything.&nbsp; And if we do that, I think we’ll have done our duty.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With history and God watching, we will have to prove that there is nothing beyond the capacity of the United States when we’re united &#8212; the United States.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You know, some of the senior senators who are here used to kid me because I was quoting Irish poets on the floor of the United States Senate. &nbsp;And there&#8217;s a poem, “The Cure at Troy,” written by an Irish poet who I got to know.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It says: History teaches us not to hope “on this side of the grave.&nbsp; But then, once in a lifetime, [that]…tidal wave of justice [rises] up, and hope and history rhyme.”<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I honestly believe we&#8217;re at one of those moments.&nbsp; There&#8217;s so much at stake.&nbsp; The division has become so palpable, not just here, but around the world.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have a chance.&nbsp; We have a chance &#8212; a chance to make hope and history rhyme, because the rest of the world is looking to us.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every time I&#8217;d walk out of my Grandpa Finnegan’s house up in Scranton &#8212; some of you heard me say this before &#8212; he’d yell, “Joey, keep the faith.”&nbsp; My grandmother would yell, “No, Joey, spread it.”&nbsp; Let&#8217;s go spread the faith.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Roosevelt Room</p>



<p>10:21 A.M. EST<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Good morning.&nbsp; Last night, operating on my orders, United States military forces successfully removed a major terrorist threat to the world: the global leader of ISIS, known as Hajji Abdullah.</p>



<p>He took over as the leader of ISIS in 2019 after the United States counterterrorism operation killed al-Baghdadi.</p>



<p>Since then, ISIS has directed terrorist operations targeting Americans, our Allies and our partners, and countless civilians in the Middle East, Africa, and in South Asia.</p>



<p>Hajji Abdullah oversaw the spread of ISIS-affiliated terrorist groups around the world after savaging communities and murdering innocents.</p>



<p>He was responsible for the recent brutal attack on a prison in northeast Syria holding ISIS fighters, which was swiftly addressed by our brave partners in the Syrian Democratic Forces.</p>



<p>He was the driving force behind the genocide of the Yazidi people in northwestern Iraq in 2014.</p>



<p>&nbsp;We all remember the gut-wrenching stories: mass slaughters that wiped out entire villages, thousands of women and young girls sold into slavery, rape used as a weapon of war.</p>



<p>And thanks to the bravery of our troops, this horrible terrorist leader is no more.</p>



<p>Our forces carried out the operation with their signature preparation and precision, and I directed the Department of Defense to take every precaution possible to minimize civilian casualties.</p>



<p>Knowing that this terrorist had chosen to surround himself with families, including children, we made a choice to pursue a special forces raid, at a much greater risk than our &#8212; to our own people, rather than targeting him with an air strike.&nbsp; We made this choice to minimize civilian casualties.</p>



<p>Our team is still compiling their report, but we do know that as our troops approached to capture the terrorist, in a final act of desperate cowardice, he &#8212; with no regard to the lives of his own family or others in the building, he chose to blow himself up &#8212; not just with a vest, but to blow up that third floor rather than face justice for the crimes he has committed, taking several members of his family with him just as his predecessor did.</p>



<p>I’m grateful for the immense courage and skill and determination of our U.S. forces who skillfully executed this incredibly challenging mission.</p>



<p>The members of our military are the solid-steel backbone of this nation, ready to fly into danger at a moment’s notice to keep our country and the American people safe, as well as our Allies.</p>



<p>And I’m also grateful to the families of our service members.&nbsp; You serve right alongside your &#8212; these soldiers and sailors, Marines, special forces &#8212; the loved ones, giving them the strength and support they need to do what they do.</p>



<p>To our service members and their families: We are forever grateful for the &#8212; what you do for us, and we owe you a debt.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>We’re also aided by the essential partnership of the Syrian Democratic Forces.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I want to commend our dedicated intelligence community, the Department of Defense, and members of our national security team throughout the government whose meticulous and tireless work over the course of many months ensured that this mission succeeded.</p>



<p>This operation is testament to America’s reach and capability to take out terrorist threats no matter where they try to hide anywhere in the world.</p>



<p>I’m determined to protect the American people from terrorist threats, and I will take decisive action to protect this country.</p>



<p>&nbsp;And we’ll continue working with our close allies and partners &#8212; the Syrian Democratic Forces; the Iraqi Security Forces, including the Kurdish Peshmerga; and the more than 80 members of the global coalition &#8212; to keep pressure on ISIS, to protect our homeland.</p>



<p>We remain vigilant.&nbsp; We remain prepared.</p>



<p>Last night’s operation took a major terrorist leader off the battlefield.&nbsp; And it sent a strong message to terrorists around the world: We will come after you and find you.</p>



<p>Once again, today, we continue our unceasing effort to keep the American people safe and to strengthen the security of our Allies and partners around the world.</p>



<p>I want to thank you all.&nbsp; And may God bless you.&nbsp; And may God protect our troops.</p>



<p>I’m heading off to New York right now; I’m late.&nbsp; And I thank you for your time.&nbsp; Appreciate it.</p>

<p>MODERATOR:  Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on short notice.  Today&#8217;s call is going to be on background, attributed to &#8220;senior administration officials,&#8221; and the contents will be embargoed until the President concludes his remarks later this morning, probably at about 9:45 a.m., but please watch the feed and we will confirm when the embargo has lifted.<br><br>     Our speakers today are going to be [senior administration official] and [senior administration official].  We&#8217;ll turn it over to [senior administration official] and [senior administration official] for some opening comments, and then we&#8217;re happy to take your questions.<br><br>     SENIOR ADMINSTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thank you.  I will give about a 10-minute opening on what happened last night and then turn it over to [senior administration official].<br><br>     Operating on the President&#8217;s orders, U.S. military forces, last night, successfully targeted Abu Ibrahim al-Qurashi, also known as Hajji Abdullah, the leader of ISIS and the successor to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.<br><br>     Hajji Abdullah coordinated the group&#8217;s global terror operations to include directing operations that posed a direct threat to the American people and our partners around the world.<br><br>     He was a driving force behind the genocide of the Yazidi religious minority in northwestern Iraq in 2014 and the enslavement of thousands of young Yazidi girls, using rape as a weapon of war.<br><br>     He oversaw the network that included ISIS branches around the world, from Africa to Afghanistan.<br><br>     He was directly overseeing activities of ISIS across Iraq and Syria, which were seeking to reconstitute under his leadership.<br><br>     The world is a safer place with him gone.<br><br>     Let me provide some context on the President&#8217;s command and direction of yesterday&#8217;s operation, and then I&#8217;ll turn it over to my colleague at DOD to provide some updates and tactical aspects.<br><br>     This operation has been months in planning.  The President was first briefed on the operation in depth over a month ago by the operational commanders and after we learned that Hajji Abdullah was definitely in this site.<br><br>     The President was regularly updated by his national security team on the planning details of this operation, to include a brief in the Oval Office earlier this week.<br><br>     He gave the final go on this operation on Tuesday morning, with the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Milley, in the Oval Office.<br><br>     Last night, the President monitored key aspects of the operation in real-time in the White House Situation Room, receiving reports from the Secretary of Defense, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and General McKenzie and their teams.<br><br>     This operation is consistent with the President&#8217;s commitment to take out threats to the American people wherever they are and in any manner that does not require large deployments of U.S. forces.<br><br>     We are especially grateful for our local partner, the Syrian Democratic Forces, whose support was essential to the mission&#8217;s success and with whom we will continue to relentlessly pursue remnants of ISIS and its leadership.<br><br>     Let me say a few words about the operation itself.  The President, of course, directed the Department of Defense to take every precaution to minimize noncombatant casualties in this operation.<br><br>     That was particularly challenging here because Hajji Abdullah seemed to purposefully live in a residential building, with families on the first floor that we believe had nothing to do with ISIS and did not know who was living on the third floor.<br><br>     Hajji Abdullah never left the house.  He commanded by couriers who came and went.  He used these innocent people as his shield.<br><br>     It was due to the risk of this unwitting family and other civilians in the area that President Biden ordered this air assault operation, placing our own troops at risk to minimize the risk to others.  And they succeeded in that mission.<br><br>     In the earliest stages of the operation, a family on the first floor &#8212; one woman, one man, and a number of children &#8212; were safely removed from the site.<br><br>     Unfortunately, ISIS once again revealed its barbarity.  In a final act of cowardice and disregard for human life, Hajji Abdullah detonated a blast &#8212; a significant blast &#8212; killing himself and several others, including his wife and children.<br><br>     This is the same terrorist tactic of his predecessor: taking his own life and his own family, rather than face justice or stand and fight on his own.  Both these terrorist leaders murdered their own families. <br><br>     In this case, the blast was so large, on the third floor, that it blew bodies outside of the house and into the surrounding areas.<br><br>     All casualties at the site were due to the acts of ISIS terrorists inside the residence, including Hajji Abdullah, who set off this charge destroying most of the third floor.<br><br>     An associate of Hajji Abdullah &#8212; another ISIS terrorist, an ISIS lieutenant &#8212; barricaded himself and members of his own family in the second floor.  He and his wife engaged the assault force.  They were killed in the course of the operation.<br><br>After the second ISIS terrorist was eliminated, an additional number of children came out of the second-floor dwelling area and were safely removed from the site.<br><br>ISIS has made clear over and over again its utter and complete disregard for human life.  And that was clearly on display throughout the operation last night.<br><br>Looking ahead, the terrorist threats we face today are more ideologically diverse and geographically diffuse than 20 years ago.  Groups such as ISIS and al Qaeda have expanded across Africa and Southeast Asia.  These global networks and affiliates still aspire to attack the United States.<br><br>Years of sustained counterterrorism operations, pressure has forced them to shift their operating models and constrain their capabilities, but the threat remains serious.<br><br>Our partnership at the international, national, and local levels are vital to our success.  And this is not solely a military effort.  Working in concert with a global coalition of over 80 partners who are working to share intelligence, repatriate foreign fighters, prosecute ISIS leaders, and perhaps most importantly, deescalate regional conflicts and stabilize former ISIS safe havens to ensure these groups can not &#8212; never again resurge and threaten the American people.<br><br>President Biden has redoubled our commitment to stabilizing areas liberated from ISIS in Iraq and Syria, and recommitted to our vital partnerships in the region to include the counter-ISIS coalition, NATO, and our local and regional partners, all of whom remain essential to this ongoing effort.<br><br>The bottom line is that President Biden remains steadfast in his commitment to protecting the American people from the threat posed by terrorist groups.  Last night’s successful action took a major terrorist leader and his lieutenant off the battlefield, makes it clear that we will hold anyone accountable who seeks to harm Americans at home or around the world.<br><br>And I think the key facts of this operation, again, just show the barbarity of these ISIS terrorists.  All the casualties at the site were due specifically to their actions, including the significant detonation of Hajji Abdullah and the decision of his lieutenant to barricade himself on a second-floor room and engage U.S. assault forces.<br><br>And with that, I will turn it over to my colleague at the Department of Defense.<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thank you.  So, ladies and gentlemen, just to give you a little bit more background on the specific operational aspects to reinforce some of what was earlier said: So, this is an operation that has been long in planning and, from a tactical perspective, went precisely as expected. <br><br>The overall goal here was to remove Hajji Abdullah from the battlefield, and that was successful.  Much of what was built into this operation was explicitly and predictably based on protecting non-combatants.  We had good sense of who was in the building, as has already been briefed, and had taken numerous safeguards throughout the rehearsals and planning to protect those individuals. <br><br>What we can’t account for, of course, is actions taken by the targeted individuals themselves.  And in this case, it appears that they chose to detonate explosives or take other hostile action that resulted in the deaths of their relatives.<br><br>And with that, we can go through some of the details here of some of the operational mechanics for your benefit. <br><br>So, with the idea that noncombatants would be protected, it was an explicit decision to conduct a raid as opposed to a standoff strike of any sort.  With that, the raid force took a number of steps, including conducting call-outs &#8212; so, announcing their presence, asking people to leave the building, which resulted in some of the innocents coming out, as already has been briefed.  We were conscious of the fact that this is a residential area and there were also children in the building.<br><br>There were also multiple messages to local components around &#8212; this would be civilians and others &#8212; to ensure that they knew what was underway and didn&#8217;t in some way interfere, unintended or intended. <br><br>But intense care taken throughout the operation.  Much of this was built, again, on the idea that we knew that this was a complex target.<br><br>I will highlight a few other things just because we know it&#8217;s been out there already.  Once again, the target for this operation was the ISIS &#8212; overall ISIS Amir, Hajji Abdullah.  There were other reports of other targets &#8212; al Qaeda and others.  That&#8217;s not &#8212; that&#8217;s not truthful.<br><br>There was a situation in which one of our helicopters had a mechanical issue, and so it was properly disposed of some distance from the site; it had nothing to do with any kind of hostile action.  This was a mechanical issue, best we can tell at this early stage.<br><br>And then, further in the course of what was nearly two hours on the ground &#8212; which was the plan initially and continued to be the plan that was carried out &#8212; towards the end of that period, there was hostile action from local forces.  I think it&#8217;s important to keep in mind that this area is controlled by, in many cases, Hay&#8217;at Tahrir al-Sham, which is, by our estimate, a group that is a terrorist group; it certainly has al Qaeda affiliations.<br><br>At least some of those individuals engaged one of our helicopters, and we took action that resulted in, as we know it at this point, at least two enemy killed in action.  So some of the reports from the ground will highlight that as well.<br><br>That&#8217;s the operational laydown that augments what was already said.<br><br>I’ll turn it back over to [moderator].<br><br>MODERATOR:  Thanks very much.  Operator, we&#8217;re ready for questions.<br><br>     Q    Hi, thanks.  Real quick: Please give me a sense of how many civilians you estimate were killed.  And what was the mechanical issue with the helicopter?  And finally, was this ISIS leader in any way connected to the bombing at Abbey Gate?  Thanks.<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Phil, let me just say: Some of the numbers that are reported out there do not align with our information.  We believe the number of children that came out of this site, according to the force that oversaw this and would monitor it in real-time, a number of eight children were removed from the site safely.<br><br>The casualties were all from the third-floor detonation of Hajji Abdullah&#8217;s &#8212; the third-floor dwelling area, and the barricaded &#8212; his lieutenant on the second floor.  Those were the only casualties on the site.<br><br>And some of the numbers out there don’t align with our information, but I can&#8217;t say specifically how many people Hajji Abdullah had with him when he decided to murder them.<br><br>On the second question, I&#8217;ll turn it over to DOD.<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yeah, Phil, so the helicopter was a mechanical issue on the insertion; that, ultimately, that helicopter was able to extract itself from the immediate target area and, under control, able to land in another location where the decision was made to disable it and destroy it.<br><br>So, no casualties on the U.S. side throughout.  I think we highlighted that, but certainly not with the helicopter.<br><br>And then, on your last question on Abbey Gate: The Abbey Gate attack, of course, was ISIS Khorasan, which is an affiliate of ISIS and recognizes Hajji Abdullah as the overall Amir of ISIS.  So that&#8217;s the connection we would draw.<br><br>Over.<br><br>Q    Hi, yes.  Can you just describe again how it happened on the second floor with the lieutenant and who was killed and who was &#8212; how many survivors came out of that?<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Eric, so the assault force on the second floor, we knew that Hajji Abdullah lived in this residence with another ISIS terrorist, lieutenant of his.  And he was involved in making sure that &#8212; even though Hajji Abdullah, again, never left his residence, because he used these &#8212; his own family and the residents &#8212; the family on the first floor, including a number of children &#8212; basically as his human shields.<br><br>The lieutenant kind of helped him run day-to-day operations.  Again, couriers came in and out.  So we knew this lieutenant was in the house.  And he barricaded himself in a room on the second floor and engaged U.S. forces, as did his wife.<br><br>After that, the threat from them was eliminated.  As I mentioned, four children came out of the second-floor dwelling areas.  The ISIS lieutenant and his wife were killed.  And they may have had their children &#8212; don&#8217;t know numbers &#8212; with them in that room.  So that&#8217;s something that still has to be confirmed. <br><br>But four &#8212; after that engagement, four children came out of the second floor and were safely &#8212; were brought to safety.<br><br>I have to say, I think you can get a sense of the complications of this and the care that went into it.  I&#8217;ve seen some reporting that the fact that the operation lasted two hours was unusual.<br><br>I think, as [senior administration official] said, everything here ran, really, according to clockwork.  And as the planning went, we were in the Situation Room for the two hours of the operation on the ground, as was planned.<br><br>And I think the complications was just because the leader of ISIS decided to run this global terror network in a house with an innocent family and others living on the first floor.<br><br>Over.<br><br>Q    Hey, good morning.  Thanks very much.  I&#8217;m wondering &#8212; I know you said that this mission was in planning stages for a long time.  Can you say whether the raid on a prison in Syria by ISIS and the recapturing of that, whether that played at all into the timeline of actually carrying out this operation?<br><br>And secondly, what is your assessment of the extent to which this killing will affect the future of ISIS in Syria and abroad?<br><br>And lastly, if you can just talk at all about any of the intelligence that led to that raid &#8212; what type of intelligence, and how the U.S. came to act on that intelligence.  Thanks.<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  So this is [senior administration official].  Let me just &#8212; as the intelligence came in &#8212; that we believed we had a lead on Hajji Abdullah &#8212; of course, the President was briefed on this immediately and directed all of the whole interagency and national security team following these issues to make sure we did everything we possibly could to confirm his identity, and then, the President, obviously directing his military intelligence team to find the best mechanism to take this terrorist off the battlefield. <br><br>So, that whole process was really months &#8212; months in process.  The final fix of this certainty that this was Hajji Abdullah, I think it’s safe to say about early December or so. <br><br>And the President was briefed in December in detail, including, again, operational commanders came in to the Situation Room and briefed the President on a number of possible options for taking down this terrorist target, including the extraordinary complexity because of the number of children in the area, the families on the first floor, and the fact that Hajji Abdullah, with the exception of sometimes going to pray on his roof, never came out of the house.  He ran ISIS through couriers and by staying on the third floor of his residence. <br><br>So, an incredibly complex endeavor.  The President was directly involved throughout these deliberations, a constant give-and-take with his commanders and the national security team.  And, again, gave the final go for this operation on Tuesday morning in the Oval Office. <br><br>So, this was a process that was obviously months in work by our intelligence community to find a fixed location and our military team to develop options to present to the President. <br><br>So, that was basically the process here.<br><br>The prison &#8212; Hajji Abdullah directly was overseeing these operations in Syria, and including the prison, we believe.  But, no, the timing of the operation was not &#8212; was not tied to the prison operation at Hasakah.<br><br>[Senior administration official], anything else you want to add?<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I&#8217;ll just pick up on that theme, to answer the third question.  So, we think the impact of Hajji Abdullah being removed is going to be a blow to ISIS because he&#8217;s &#8212; even while Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was the Amir, Hajji Abdullah was heavily involved in running many of the operations, including many of the external operations; as was already alluded to, was certainly influential in what was multiple threat streams against the Hasakah prison.<br><br>So, we anticipate that this is going to lead to disruption within ISIS.  He&#8217;s really one of the few remaining, shall we call them “legacy leaders.”  And so, this is a continued push that has been underway for quite some time to continue to remove the leadership elements of ISIS.<br><br>Over.<br><br>Q    Thanks, [senior administration official].  Let me ask you, kind of, broadly, in the aftermath.  The United States has killed Bin Laden and Baghdadi and now the latest ISIS leader.  What is the state of jihadism?  You mentioned how &#8212; its global spread.  How much harder is it for the United States to counter its efforts?  How much better off or worse off are we are than in the early days?<br><br>Secondly, can you describe the Situation Room and what, you know, some of the atmospherics of what Biden was doing.  Were there moments of tension?  Were there moments of &#8212; (inaudible) of work?<br><br>And finally, the SDF, how much of a role did it play in the initial intelligence &#8212; locating this guy, doing the legwork and the prep for this raid?<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Let me hit some of that.  Just on the state of ISIS &#8212; of course, it wasn&#8217;t long ago, Robin, you were covering &#8212; they controlled a caliphate with 8 million people and were carrying out attacks all around the world in Paris, Brussels, elsewhere.<br><br>Obviously, it’s significantly degraded.  The leader of ISIS, Hajji Abdullah, hiding in a residential area, living on a third floor of a residential facility, but still in command of ISIS through a network of couriers and a global network, which obviously we have pretty good fidelity into.<br><br>So I think just the extraordinary work of our professionals who do this day-to-day, very difficult work are keeping the American people safe.  And I&#8217;ll turn it over to [senior administration official] for some more details on the state of the global jihad situation. <br><br>The SDF is essential.  We cannot do any of this without them.  So, just critical.  I don&#8217;t want to get into any details, but critical, vital enablers for operations like this. <br><br>In the Situation Room, we&#8217;ve monitored the operation in real-time, again, from shortly before the forces on the ground to when they landed.  The President came in with the Vice President and was receiving real-time reports from, as I mentioned, Lloyd Austin and General Milley and Frank McKenzie in real time.  So it was real-time monitoring.  We were able to monitor the situation with the helicopter mechanical failure.  The fact that &#8212; which we were all very focused on.  Obviously, tremendous tension, just given the number of children we knew were in the house, on the first floor. <br><br>It was a relief when one of the first reports was that when the team came on site and called everyone to come out, those on the first floor did come out and were led to safety.  Because, obviously, that was a key point of concern and why this operation was so complex. <br><br>There was then a report, before the assault force went into the house, of the significant explosion on the third floor, which later confirmed was Hajji Abdullah detonated basically the third floor &#8212; the third floor of the residence, killing himself and murdering his own family.  That happened fairly early in the operation. <br><br>And then, the second floor, a terrorist barricading himself and engaging our forces. <br><br>So this all kind of ran, you know, kind of in a linear fashion throughout the operation. <br><br>We also had the engagement, as [senior administration official] mentioned, with one of our helicopters, which we were able to &#8212; also able to monitor. <br><br>The President was obviously pleased with the reports from his commanders &#8212; tremendous praise for our team.  And when the team was wheels up, the President left the Situation Room.  He said, “God bless our troops.”  And I think Jake kept him informed throughout the night because they had to do another couple of stops to obviously get to safety.  And that was the operation.<br><br>So, a very &#8212; after months of planning, the President being very steeped in the operational details.  The commanders, as I mentioned, came into the Situation Room in December with a tabletop model of this site, which demonstrated where Hajji Abdullah was and the complexity of this operation.<br><br>This was not without significant, significant risk, both to our force, just given the forces who are in this area, as [senior administration official] mentioned, and also just the nature of this dwelling and the way Hajji Abdullah decided to conduct his affairs.  Incredibly complex, high risk. <br><br>And the President just &#8212; at the end just praised the professionalism &#8212; incredible professionalism of our forces.<br><br>Anything else to add, [senior administration official]?<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Maybe just briefly on the overall global terrorist situation. <br><br>So I think, as already mentioned, ISIS has really been focused on &#8212; even though their caliphate has been degraded and many of their leaders have been killed or captured &#8212; continues to at least express the intent to conduct attacks against the United States and the West.<br><br>But the capability that has been pretty significantly degraded, starting with a series of leadership losses and then the rollback of the territory that [senior administration official] alluded to that they controlled until 2019 &#8212; we nonetheless see an expansion of ISIS branches and networks to over three dozen different countries.  But a lot of that is overseen from ISIS Khor &#8212; Hajji Abdullah and others.  <br><br>     We have, on balance, seen fewer attacks against the United States and Western interest in recent years.  And we assess that that’s a large function of the pressure that the coalition, some of the local allies, like the SDF and the United States, have placed on the network.<br><br>Over.<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  If I can give one more &#8212; just one more anecdote.  We, of course, considered that Hajji Abdullah, on the third floor, might detonate himself in the operation, just given the record here &#8212; Baghdadi, for example.<br><br>And our engineers from our military team studying the structure, from the modeling they were able to do, did determine that if in the early phase of the operation Hajji Abdullah were to set off a detonation, that the structure would not collapse.  Because one of our main concerns was that he would kill himself and the structure would collapse, killing everyone else in the building.<br><br>So, we had high confidence that if this went according to how we thought it might go and did go &#8212; that he detonated himself and murdered his own family &#8212; it would not collapse the building and kill the other people in the building.<br><br>I doubt he knew that when he set off that detonation, so he obviously had every intent to take his own life and murder his own family, and at the very least, reckless disregard for everyone else in the building.<br><br>We had high confidence that if he did that, as he did, that the building would remain structurally sound as it did.  But I just want to emphasize, I doubt he knew that.  And it was probably his intent to kill everybody in that building.<br><br>But I think that just shows the level of detail that went into planning this operation.  And that fact was discussed a number of times with the President &#8212; if Hajji Abdullah were to detonate himself, would the building remain structurally sound, and it did.<br><br>Q    Hey, good morning.  Thanks for having this call.  Just a couple points of clarification.  One, with the helicopter mechanical issue, was there any kind of hard landing or crash?  And then, two, it sounds to me like U.S. forces were definitely outside the building when the explosion happened.  Do you have any estimate for how far away?  Thank you.<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  So, the first issue on the helicopter: No, no hard landing.  This was the issue that resulted upon the immediate infil.  And the helicopter was able to depart the target location and move to another location, at which point it was determined that it was not going to be feasible for it to return to the next location for the return flight.<br><br>So, the decision was made to destroy it in place, well distant from the target location.  So, well beyond any kind of visual range.<br><br>On the question of the distance, as [senior administration official] already alluded to and as extensive experience over the years has shown, oftentimes the tactic used by these types of people barricaded, especially those known to wear suicide vests, is to explode themselves or the building they&#8217;re in.  So the assault force was well outside the range of what we assessed to be the likely explosive impact.  And as a result, none of the assaulters were injured in the initial blast, which, again, as [senior administration official] alluded to, occurred very quickly in the operation, shortly after the initial call-out and shortly after the family on the first floor departed.<br><br>So, we assessed that to have gone as we had &#8212; as part of our planning.  And certainly think that Hajji Abdullah  knew that his minutes were numbered, or he was at least going to be captured, and decided to take out not only the third floor but also the women and children with him.<br><br>Over.<br><br>MODERATOR:  Thanks, everyone.  That concludes our call today.  A reminder that we were on background, attributed to “senior administration officials” and that the contents of this call are embargoed until the President finishes speaking this morning.<br><br>We expect that he will go out shortly after 9:30 and give brief remarks.  So, hopefully, that will be before 10:00 a.m. when we&#8217;re able to lift the embargo.<br><br>Thanks all for joining, and have a good day.  Bye-bye.<br><br>9:19 A.M. EST</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"> </p>



<p>Today, the Biden Administration is announcing additional actions to reduce gun crime and make communities safer. This plan builds on the steps the President has taken since the beginning of his Administration to stop the flow of guns being used in crimes, bolster federal, state, and local law enforcement, invest in community-based programs that prevent, interrupt, and reduce violence, expand opportunity, lower recidivism, and increase funding for community policing.<br><br>The President is committed to serving as a strong partner for communities on the frontlines of the fight against crime. That’s why his American Rescue Plan gives cities and states historic levels of funding that they can use to put more cops on the beat, and invest in community-based violence prevention and intervention programs.<br><br>President Biden also recognizes the important role that federal law enforcement plays in supporting their local partners – especially in stopping the interstate flow of guns used in crimes, like the gun that was used in the tragic recent fatal shooting of two NYPD officers. The Department of Justice has launched five gun trafficking strike forces, including one in New York City, and it has implemented a nationwide <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-merrick-b-garland-announces-new-effort-reduce-violent-crime">strategy to combat violent crime</a>, which has focused over the past year in taking violent criminals and thousands of crime guns off the streets.<br><br>Stronger law enforcement is critical in stopping gun crime, but it’s made more effective when we make real investments in making our communities stronger and in addressing the causes of crime before it spills over into violence. That’s why President Biden’s comprehensive approach makes sure cities and states have the funding, training, and know-how they need to invest in proven tactics including community policing, street outreach by credible messengers, hospital-based intervention, and youth programming. And it’s bolstered by additional funding to create economic opportunity with job training, expand after-school activities, and provide stable housing and other stabilizing supports necessary to reduce recidivism and help formerly incarcerated individuals reenter their communities. That’s also why the President continues to urge Congress to act on his $300 million budget request to more than double the size of the Department of Justice’s COPS community policing grant program.<br><br>Taken together, this strategy steps up and focuses law enforcement efforts on violent offenders, stems the trafficking of illegal guns, and makes real investments in communities to intervene in and prevent gun violence. The President knows a complex and devastating challenge like the surge of gun crime we’ve seen over the last two years requires an ambitious, evidence-based response that uses every tool at our disposal, and that’s exactly what his plan does.<br><br><strong>The President’s Comprehensive Strategy to Reduce Gun Crime</strong><br><br>Last June, President Biden announced a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/23/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-comprehensive-strategy-to-prevent-and-respond-to-gun-crime-and-ensure-public-safety/">five-part, comprehensive strategy</a> to tackle the persistent spike in gun crime cities across the country have experienced since the start of the pandemic. The President’s strategy:</p>



<ul><li>Stems the flow of firearms used to commit violence,</li><li>Supports local law enforcement with federal tools and resources to address violent crime,</li><li>Invests in evidence-based community violence interventions,</li><li>Expands summer programming, employment opportunities, and other services and supports for teenagers and young adults, and</li><li>Helps formerly incarcerated individuals successfully reenter their communities.</li></ul>



<p><strong>New Actions to Implement the President’s Comprehensive Strategy</strong><br><br><em>Surging Efforts to Enforce Our Gun Laws and Keep Guns out of Dangerous Hands</em><br><br>Today, the U.S. Department of Justice announced a set of important new actions to stem the flow of firearms used to commit violence and support local law enforcement partners in efforts to combat gun crime. The Justice Department will:</p>



<ul><li>Prioritize combating violent crime by directing every U.S. Attorney’s Office nationwide to increase resources dedicated to district-specific violent crime strategies. The Justice Department will work with state and local law enforcement to address the most significant drivers of violence in each district, including to get repeat gun violence offenders off of our streets. &nbsp;New&nbsp;York City’s Gun Violence Strategic Partnership – which the President and Attorney General will visit today with Mayor Eric Adams – is one model of the strategies Justice will help expand nationwide.</li><li>Crack down on the “Iron Pipeline” – the illegal flow of guns sold in the south, transported up the East Coast, and found at crime scenes in cities from Baltimore to New York City – and other firearms trafficking by adding personnel and other resources to strengthen the Justice Department’s multijurisdictional task forces that target interstate firearms trafficking.</li><li>Launch a National Ghost Gun Enforcement Initiative, which will train a national cadre of prosecutors and disseminate investigation and prosecution tools to help bring cases against those who use ghost guns to commit crimes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Pursue unlawful gun sellers that put firearms in the wrong hands by taking steps such as prioritizing federal prosecutions of those who criminally sell or transfer firearms that are used in violent crimes, including unlicensed dealers who sell guns to criminals without the required background checks.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Read more about the Justice Department’s new actions <a href="https://www.justice.gov/file/1468221/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.<br><br><em>Providing States and Cities with the Resources They Need to Reduce Gun Crime</em><br><br>Today, the President is reaffirming his call for Congress to reach a bipartisan agreement on FY22 appropriations that include half a billion dollars in new funding for proven strategies we know will reduce gun crime: a $300 million increase to expand accountable community policing through the COPS Hiring Program and $200 million for evidence-based community violence interventions. Facing a spike in gun crime that has persisted since the start of the pandemic, cities across the country cannot wait any longer for Congress to provide the resources the President requested as part of his FY22 Budget to save lives.<br><br><strong>Building on Progress: One Year of Action to Reduce Gun Violence</strong><br><br>Below are a few highlights of the Administration’s work to implement the President’s comprehensive gun crime reduction strategy over the past seven months. You can read a full wrap-up of the Administration’s first year of gun violence prevention work <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/ope/briefing-room/2021/12/14/2021-efforts-to-reduce-gun-violence/">here</a>.<br><br>1. Stemming the flow of firearms used to commit violence. In June 2021, the Justice Department announced a new policy to underscore zero tolerance for certain willful violations of the law by federally licensed firearms dealers that put public safety at risk. In July, the Justice Department launched five new law enforcement strike forces focused on addressing significant firearms trafficking corridors that have diverted guns to New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, the Bay Area, and Washington, D.C. Those strike forces have already opened more than 540 investigations and taken custody of almost 3,100 crime guns. Last year, the Justice Department’s Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) issued a proposed rule to help curb the proliferation of “ghost guns,” which are unserialized, privately made firearms that are increasingly being recovered at crime scenes and have been identified by law enforcement officials as a serious threat to public safety.&nbsp;&nbsp;ATF is analyzing public comments in response to the proposed rule, the next step in the regulatory process.<br><br>2. Supporting local law enforcement with federal tools and resources to address violent crime. The Biden Administration made historic levels of funding from the American Rescue Plan – $350 billion in state and local funding – available for law enforcement purposes such as hiring more officers, investing in retention strategies, and paying overtime to advancing community policing strategies in communities experiencing an increase in gun violence associated with the pandemic. Funds were also made available for prosecuting gun traffickers, rogue dealers, and other parties contributing to the supply of crime guns, as well as collaborative federal/state/local efforts to identify and address gun trafficking channels. Cities across the country, such as Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Albuquerque, New Mexico; Syracuse, New York; and Mobile, Alabama, have responded to this call by committing and deploying ARP funds to community-oriented policing and other law enforcement strategies. In addition, as part of the Justice Department’s <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-merrick-b-garland-announces-new-effort-reduce-violent-crime">Comprehensive Strategy for Reducing Violent Crime</a>, the Justice Department has supported law enforcement in local communities in addressing gun violence. In particular, the Justice Department has provided enforcement support from the ATF, Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI), Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), and United States Marshals Service (USMS).&nbsp;<br><br>3. Investing in evidence-based community violence interventions. As part of his Build Back Better agenda, President Biden proposed $5 billion in funding for the Department of Justice and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to invest in community violence interventions – evidence-based programs that are shown to help reduce violent crime.&nbsp;While working to secure this funding, the Biden Administration is using existing resources to expand community violence interventions. For example, the Biden Administration made certain American Rescue Plan (ARP) funding – $350 billion in state and local funding, and $122 billion in K-12 funding – available as unprecedented resources for CVI. Senior White House advisors also issued a <a href="http://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/2021/images/07/12/071221.crime.memo.pdf">memo</a> to state and local officials outlining how these elected leaders not only can – but should – use ARP funds for CVI. Cities across the country, such as Seattle, Washington; Buffalo, New York; and Atlanta, Georgia – have responded to this call by committing and deploying ARP funds for CVI. In addition, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/07/fact-sheet-more-details-on-the-biden-harris-administrations-investments-in-community-violence-interventions/">five federal agencies made changes to 26 different programs</a> to direct vital support to community violence intervention programs as quickly as possible. In July, senior White House staff <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/16/readout-of-first-meeting-of-white-house-community-violence-intervention-collaborative/">established</a> The White House Community Violence Intervention Collaborative, a 16-jurisdiction cohort of mayors, law enforcement, CVI experts, and philanthropic leaders committed to using American Rescue Plan funding or other public funding to increase investment in their community violence intervention infrastructure. The Collaborative is spending 18 months strengthening and scaling the jurisdictions’ community violence intervention infrastructure to reduce gun crime and promote public safety. National experts and federal agencies are providing training and technical assistance to help communities assess their existing public safety ecosystem, identify gaps, and build the capacity to expand programming that saves lives.&nbsp;<br><br>4. Expanding summer programming, employment opportunities, and other services and supports for teenagers and young adults. The Biden Administration has made historic levels of funding from the American Rescue Plan&nbsp; – $350 billion in state and local funding and $122 billion in school funding&nbsp; – available for purposes such as hiring nurses, counselors, and social workers; providing court personnel and operations costs to return to pre-pandemic operation levels; providing and expanding employment services, including summer jobs for young people and programs that provide training and work experience for formerly incarcerated persons and other individuals who live in communities most impacted by high levels of violence; providing and expanding summer education and enrichment programs, including summer camp; and scaling up wraparound services, such as housing, medical and mental health care, trauma-informed care, substance use disorder treatment, food assistance, and job placement services, for victims of crime, young people, formerly incarcerated persons, and individuals and households facing economic insecurity due to the pandemic. Cities and counties across the country, including St. Louis, Missouri; Tucson, Arizona; and Los Angeles County, California, have responded to this call by committing and deploying ARP funds for these purposes.<br><br>5. Helping formerly incarcerated individuals successfully reenter their communities. On June 21 the Department of Labor awarded $85.5 million to help formerly incarcerated adults and young people in 28 communities transition out of the criminal justice system and connect with quality jobs. This included $60 million for Pathway Home projects serving adults, including beginning while participants are still incarcerated and continuing post-release, as well as $25.5 million in Young Adult Reentry Partnership grants to organizations serving young adults 18-24 who were previously involved with the justice system or who left high school before graduation. The President’s FY22 budget proposal calls for an increase in these grants, to $150 million, for reentry employment opportunities. The Treasury and Labor Departments has provided training and technical assistance to employers to help leverage multiple federal resources, including the <a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/wotc">Work Opportunity Tax Credit</a> (WOTC) and the <a href="https://bonds4jobs.com/">federal bonding program</a> to encourage employment of formerly incarcerated persons. In FY21, the Department of Justice’s Office of Justice Programs (OJP)&nbsp;provided more than $110 million in grant awards to support adults and youth returning to their communities after confinement. The President’s FY22 budget proposal calls for a $25 million increase for Second Chance Act programs, to further invest in diversion and substance abuse treatment programs, enhance reentry and rehabilitation efforts, and connect people with mental health services.<br><br>In addition, the President’s House-passed Build Back Better Act includes $1.5 billion for grants to help formerly incarcerated individuals secure good jobs and successfully reenter their communities. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will create hundreds of thousands of good-paying jobs that formerly incarcerated individuals will be able to access. Lastly, in his <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/06/25/executive-order-on-diversity-equity-inclusion-and-accessibility-in-the-federal-workforce/">Executive Order on Advancing Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility</a> President Biden directed the Office of Personnel Management to evaluate barriers to federal employment for formerly incarcerated persons and actions to reduce these barriers, including educating and partnering with agencies to leverage hiring authorities to bring formerly incarcerated individuals into federal government.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Via Teleconference</p>



<p>3:08 P.M. EST</p>



<p>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us.&nbsp;Today, Dr. Walensky will provide an update on Omicron, Dr. Fauci will present the latest science, and Dr. Murthy will discuss Pfizer’s vaccine application for kids under the age of five.&nbsp; And then I’ll cover operational planning so that we’re ready for that age group.&nbsp;<br><br>With that, over to Dr. Walensky.&nbsp; Dr. Walensky?<br><br>DR. WALENSKY:&nbsp; Thank you, Jeff.&nbsp; Good afternoon.&nbsp; I&#8217;d like to start by walking you through today’s data.&nbsp;<br><br>The current seven-day daily average of cases is about 446,400 cases per day, a decrease of about 36 percent over the previous week.<br><br>The seven-day average of hospital admissions is about 17,100 per day, also a decrease of about 14 percent over the previous week.&nbsp;<br><br>And the seven-day average daily deaths are about 2,300 per day, which is an increase of about 4 percent over the prior week.<br><br>While we continue to see large decreases in average daily case counts across the country, hospitalizations remain high, stretching our healthcare capacity and workforce to its limits in some areas of the country.&nbsp; And daily deaths also remain quite high.&nbsp;<br><br>And with the mixed news above, similar to other waves during the pandemic, our data continue to reinforce the critical importance of vaccination.<br><br>Last week, I shared data from our surveillance studies demonstrating the effectiveness of vaccination, including boosters, on decreasing cases, emergency department visits, and hospitalizations.&nbsp;<br><br>Additional new data continue to support these findings.&nbsp; On this slide, you can see data from 25 U.S. jurisdictions that report cases and deaths linked to vaccination status.&nbsp;<br><br>Similar to what I showed you last week, vaccination and booster doses substantially decrease the risk of death from COVID-19.&nbsp; Looking at the data from the week ending December 4th, the number of average weekly deaths for those who are unvaccinated was 9.7 per 100,000 people, but only 0.7 per 100,000 people for those who were vaccinated.&nbsp;<br><br>This means the risk of dying from COVID-19 was 14 times higher for people who were unvaccinated compared to those who received only a primary series.&nbsp;<br><br>For those who were boosted, the average of weekly deaths was 0.1 per 100,000 people, meaning that unvaccinated individuals were 97 times more likely to die compared to those who were boosted.&nbsp;<br><br>I also want to share new data from CDC’s COVID-NET hospital surveillance network to further show how essential vaccination and boosting is in preventing hospitalization from COVID-19.<br><br>On this slide, you can see data comparing the percentage of people age 65 and older who are unvaccinated and boosted in the general population &#8212; in blue &#8212; and those who are hospitalized &#8212; in green.&nbsp;<br><br>As shown on the slide, only 12 percent of those age 65 and over remain unvaccinated in the general population.&nbsp; But when we look at those over the age of 65 who are in the hospital for COVID-19, 54 percent are unvaccinated.&nbsp;<br><br>In stark contrast, now let&#8217;s look at those who have been boosted &#8212; on the bottom.&nbsp; Here, 57 percent of those over age 65 are boosted in the general population.&nbsp; And only 8 percent of those over the age of 65 and in the hospital for COVID-19 have received a booster dose.&nbsp;<br><br>These same trends are seen across all age groups.&nbsp; These data show us that the percent of people who are currently hospitalized due to COVID-19 are disproportionately unvaccinated and disproportionately not boosted.<br><br>Additionally, these data confirm that vaccination and boosting continue to protect against severe illness and hospitalization, even during the Omicron surge.<br><br>If you are not up to date on your COVID-19 vaccinations, you have not optimized your protection against severe disease and death, and you should get vaccinated and boosted if you are eligible.&nbsp;<br><br>Thank you.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll now turn it over to Dr. Fauci.<br><br>DR. FAUCI:&nbsp; Thank you very much, Dr. Walensky.&nbsp;<br><br>What I&#8217;d like to do over the next couple of minutes is to address a common misperception and the result of misinformation, and that is whether vaccination negatively impacts people trying to conceive &#8212; namely does it have a negative impact on fertility.&nbsp;<br><br>The data are clear.&nbsp;<br><br>Next slide.<br><br>I will show a couple of representative studies.&nbsp; This published just a week and a half ago in the American Journal of Epidemiology, which is a prospective cohort study of vaccination and SARS infection and fertility.&nbsp;<br><br>The study is an NIH-funded pregnancy study online &#8212; or “PRESTO” for short &#8212; of couples who are trying to conceive through intercourse.&nbsp; It enrolled participants before pregnancy and collected data on vaccination and other variables during the pre-conception period, and then collected data on subsequent fertility.&nbsp;<br><br>There were over 2,000 females between the ages of 21 and 45 in the U.S. or Canada.&nbsp; They were enrolled between December 2020 and September 2021, and they were followed through November 2021.<br><br>Next slide.<br><br>But data are clear: COVID-19 vaccination in male or female partners did not affect the likelihood of conception.&nbsp; Couples were 18 percent less likely to conceive if the male partner had been infected with SARS-CoV-2 within 60 days before a menstrual cycle.&nbsp; That is “infected,” not “vaccinated.”<br><br>However, the COVID-19 disease only temporarily reduced male fertility.&nbsp;<br><br>Next slide.<br><br>In another study &#8212; published, again, about a week and a half ago &#8212; this was in an in vitro fertilization clinic.&nbsp; And the question that was asked: that with people vaccinated, in this case, either with the Pfizer or the Moderna product had similar responses to ovarian stimulation, which is used to stimulate the ovary in preparation for in vitro fertilization.&nbsp; And similar pregnancy outcomes compared with unvaccinated people.<br><br>The reproductive potential does not appear to be affected by vaccination in people who undergo in vitro fertilization.<br><br>Next slide.<br><br>So, what&#8217;s our takeaway message about vaccination and conception?&nbsp; New data add to previous studies that indicate that COVID-19 vaccination does not negatively impact fertility.<br><br>CDC and professional medical organizations serving people of reproductive age emphasize, as shown on this website, that there&#8217;s no evidence that vaccination impairs fertility.&nbsp;<br><br>And, of course, as we&#8217;ve all said over and over again, vaccination is recommended for people who are trying to get pregnant now or might become pregnant in the future, as well as their partners.&nbsp; And anyone who&#8217;s vaccinated and pregnant, breastfeeding, trying to get pregnant now or might become pregnant in the future should also get a booster shot when eligible.<br><br>Final slide.<br><br>The message is the same: Get vaccinated and get boosted for so many reasons.&nbsp;<br><br>Now over to you, Dr. Murthy.<br><br>SURGEON GENERAL MURTHY:&nbsp; Well, thank you so much, Dr. Fauci.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s good to be with everyone again today.&nbsp;<br><br>As many of you know, the FDA has now received Pfizer&#8217;s application for a vaccine for children age six months through four years.&nbsp;<br><br>Now, Jeff is going to talk more about how we&#8217;re preparing for the possibility of this milestone, but first I want to walk you through the process.<br><br>Pfizer&#8217;s application will now undergo the same independent, rigorous, and transparent review process that was used to authorize the vaccines that now more than 250 million Americans have received, including millions of children ages five and up.<br><br>It will involve the FDA receiving the full data from Pfizer, posting that data publicly, and then convening its advisory committee for a transparent discussion of the data.<br><br>The FDA will then render its opinion, after which the CDC and its advisory group will assess the data and make their recommendation.&nbsp; This is the same rigorous process that was used to assess numerous vaccines long before the pandemic began.<br><br>I know how eager parents and caregivers are for the good news on this front.&nbsp; For much of this pandemic, millions of parents have carried with them an added layer of worry knowing that their children under five didn&#8217;t have protection from COVID the way older vaccinated children do.<br><br>I felt this worry too as a father of a four-year-old daughter who is not yet eligible to get vaccinated.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m hopeful that we may be one step closer to having an added layer of protection for our younger children, and one less worry for their parents.<br><br>A vaccine for children under five would mean we would have vaccines available for essentially all age groups in America.&nbsp; This would be a major milestone.<br><br>Now there are a number of steps ahead to determine if the vaccine is both safe and effective for our kids under five.&nbsp; And please know that the FDA will not cut any corners in their review process.&nbsp; They know that they are the gold standard that all of us rely on.<br><br>If and when the FDA and CDC decide to move forward, we will work closely with our trusted community partners to ensure that families have accurate science-based information about the vaccine so they can make the best decisions for their children.<br><br>And as we await this review process, I want to emphasize once more just how important it is that the rest of us get vaccinated and get our kids five and older, who are already eligible, vaccinated as well.&nbsp; If you are 12 and up and you&#8217;re vaccinated, please get boosted as soon as you&#8217;re eligible.&nbsp;<br><br>And all of us should wear high-quality masks when in public indoor settings. &nbsp;This is how we can continue to create a wall of protection around our children under five as we look to safeguard their health.<br><br>Thanks so much for your time today.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll pass it to Jeff.<br><br>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Well, thanks, Doctors.&nbsp; If the FDA authorizes and CDC recommends this vaccine, 18 million children under the age of five will become eligible for protection from COVID-19.<br><br>Before we open up for questions, I want to share how we&#8217;re preparing now, just as we did with vaccines, for kids ages 5 to 11 so that we are ready and we hit the ground running following decisions from FDA and CDC.<br><br>Importantly, this vaccine is specifically formulated for kids under the age of five.&nbsp; So, we&#8217;re working closely with states, local health departments, pediatricians, families, doctors, and pharmacies to ensure the vaccine is available at thousands of locations nationwide.<br><br>We&#8217;ve already secured ample doses and the necessary needles and supplies specially made for kids in this age group.<br><br>Following FDA authorization, we would immediately begin packing and shipping doses to states and healthcare providers.&nbsp; And in short order following CDC recommendations, parents will be able to get their kids under five vaccinated at convenient locations, locations they know and trust.<br><br>While we know many parents are eager to get their kids the protection of the vaccine, we know others have questions.&nbsp; So, we&#8217;re working with our partners to ensure all parents have access to the facts and information they need to make the right decision.<br><br>And as always, we&#8217;re laser-focused on equity and making sure we reach the hardest-hit and most at-risk communities and families.<br><br>A year ago, we stood up a historic nationwide vaccination program that&#8217;s now gotten 75 percent of adults in the U.S. fully vaccinated.<br><br>We then launched a boosters program that&#8217;s gotten almost 90 million Americans their booster shot.<br><br>And we established the vaccination program, specifically for kids ages 5 to 11, that has protected millions of kids around the country.<br><br>Now with the potential vaccine for kids under five on the horizon, our message to parents and families is simple: We&#8217;re doing everything we can to prepare now.&nbsp; We&#8217;re taking all of the best practices and applying all of the lessons learned over the last 12 months to ensure getting kids under five the protection of vaccine is easy and convenient.<br><br>And we&#8217;ll be ready to start getting shots in arms soon after FDA and CDC make their decisions.<br><br>With that, let&#8217;s open it up for some questions.&nbsp; Kevin?<br><br>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Thanks, Jeff.&nbsp; We have time for a few questions.&nbsp; Please keep your questions to one.&nbsp; First, let&#8217;s go to Laura Santhanam at PBS.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks so much.&nbsp; Can &#8212; thinking about long COVID treatment, can you tell me just sort of latest updates with research about treatment availability and accreditation of clinics offering that treatment?<br><br>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Dr. Fauci?&nbsp; Long COVID treatments.<br><br>DR. FAUCI:&nbsp; Yeah, there is a very large study that&#8217;s been initiated some time ago &#8212; the RECOVER study &#8212; at the NIH in collaboration with other agencies looking at the incidence, the prevalence, and hopefully understanding the pathogenic mechanisms of long COVID.<br><br>Right now, the data are starting to come in.&nbsp; It&#8217;s too early to make any definitive statements.&nbsp; But for those individuals &#8212; and, as you know, long COVID means the persistence of signs and symptoms that are not explainable by any readily recognizable pathogenic process following the recovery from the acute infection.&nbsp; There have been subjec- &#8212; some suggestions that it is an aberrant inflammatory response, perhaps some element of autoimmunity, perhaps some elements of persistence of nucleotide fragments from the virus.&nbsp; All of these now are being actively pursued.<br><br>But before we can make any definitive statements, we need to learn a lot more about it, with the ultimate goal of figuring out how we might be able to mitigate or prevent some of those symptoms.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Next question, please.<br><br>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Let&#8217;s go to Jeff Mason at Reuters.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; My question is about the data and about habits.&nbsp; With regard to data &#8212; for Dr. Fauci or Dr. Walensky &#8212; what is your take on why the booster rate seems to be lagging?&nbsp; Why would people who have decided to get vaccinated, the first and second doses, not be getting more boosters?<br><br>And secondly, with regard to your &#8212; the data today with cases going down and hospitalizations going down, Dr.&nbsp;Lawensky [sic] &#8212; Walensky, do you think people should start to change their habits, and it&#8217;s okay now to maybe gather in groups more or to go out to bars and restaurants?&nbsp; Or what is the overall guidance right now, in terms of &#8212; in terms of gathering in groups?<br><br>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Hey, Jeff.&nbsp; This is Jeff.&nbsp; Why don’t we just start with the baseline on where we are in the booster data.&nbsp; And that is that about half of all Americans who are eligible for a booster have gotten a booster.&nbsp; Eligibility is five months or greater for the mRNA vaccines &#8212; Pfizer and Moderna &#8212; and two months for J&amp;J.&nbsp; And importantly, about 70 percent of seniors &#8212; those over 65 &#8212; have gotten a booster.&nbsp;<br><br>As you know, boosters are widely available.&nbsp; They&#8217;re at convenient locations around the country, and they&#8217;re free.&nbsp; And obviously, the impact of a booster, as Dr. Walensky said, is really important.&nbsp; So, we obviously want to continue to drive that number higher and higher &#8212; the percent of Americans who have boosters.&nbsp;<br><br>But over to you, Dr. Fauci.&nbsp; And then, over to you, Dr. Walensky.<br><br>DR. FAUCI:&nbsp; Well, Jeff, you know, I&#8217;m really not sure you&#8217;re asking a good question.&nbsp; It&#8217;s almost a psychological or sociological question: Why would people who had enough understanding of the risk to go ahead and get the primary series &#8212; why we don&#8217;t have more getting the booster.&nbsp;<br><br>I don&#8217;t have an easy explanation for that.&nbsp; That&#8217;s one of the reasons why we keep trying to put the data out.&nbsp; Because, as Dr. Walensky showed in her slide, the data are really stunningly obvious why a booster is really very important.<br><br>You first need to get vaccinated before you get boosted, that&#8217;s for sure.&nbsp; But when you look at the difference of how a booster, for everything you ask it to do &#8212; to reconstitute, from an immunological and from a clinical standpoint, the diminished protection that you get not only with waning naturally of immunity, but also the negative impact on some of the variants that elude the immune response &#8212; fortunately for us, when you boost with the standard vaccine, which is against the original viral sequence, that you get such a good response.&nbsp;<br><br>So, the only thing that we can do is to continue to come out with the data and to make sure the American public appreciates why it is so important for optimal protection to get boosted.<br><br>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Dr. Walensky?&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br>DR. WALENSKY:&nbsp; And maybe I&#8217;ll just add in there: With regard to where cases and hospitalizations are, I think we are all cautiously optimistic as we&#8217;re seeing cases come down week over week; down 36 percent over the last week.&nbsp;<br><br>I do think we have to use an important metric as a barometer, which is: How are our hospitals doing?&nbsp; And our hospitalization rates are still quite high and certainly having hospital capacity challenges in many parts of the country still.</p>



<p>So, with that barometer, we’ve said before, Omicron &#8212; “milder” does not mean “mild.”&nbsp; And so, we really do have to look to our hospitalization rates and our death rates to look to when it is time to lift some of these mitigation efforts.</p>



<p>We will continue to reevaluate, and we know people are anxious.</p>



<p>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Next question, please.</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Let’s go to Jeannie Baumann at Bloomberg.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, thanks for taking my question.&nbsp; I was hoping, Jeff, you could be a little more &#8212; when you said “short order” for the availability of those kid vaccines, I was hoping &#8212; do you mean like a week or a few days?</p>



<p>And then, Dr. Fauci, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the Pandemic Preparedness Plan that NIAID released today, and, you know, how the lessons from COVID helped drive some of those plans, and what type of funding do you need to implement it.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Yeah, so, on the vaccines for kids under five, we’re doing all the preparation now that we can do to be ready so that it’ll be available at trusted locations as soon as possible, post &#8212; I want to emphasize again &#8212; FDA and CDC recommendations.</p>



<p>We cannot begin actually packing and shipping until the FDA authorization, and then there’s the CDC ACIP process, which generally takes place a matter of days after the FDA.</p>



<p>So, we’re talking, you know, a matter of several days to a week or so, based on the 5- to 11-year experience from FDA authorization to when the first doses will start to be shots in arms.&nbsp; But we’ll move as fast as possible, pending the decision of CDC and FDA.&nbsp; And I think the preparation we’re doing now will enable us to do so.<br><br>The second part of your question?</p>



<p>DR. FAUCI:&nbsp; Yeah, I&#8217;ll answer that, Jeff.&nbsp; She was asking about the Pandemic Preparedness Plan.</p>



<p>You know, very briefly, Jeannie, it is really founded on what we&#8217;ve been talking about for some time now, which is the prototype pathogen approach where you get fundamental information, data, and preparedness on each of the multiple families that are projected to be as a risk.</p>



<p>For example, fortunately for us, we had been doing that with the coronaviruses when we got a lot of information from SARS-CoV-1 and MERS, and were already involved in the preparation of both platform technology and immunogen design.&nbsp; We planned to do that by selecting out anywhere from 10 to 20 families of viruses in which we can find common denominators within the family and do the immunological background to do the development of phase-one-type vaccines so that we could hit the ground running.</p>



<p>The second part of the program relates to both the development and the discovery of antiviral drugs &#8212; those that are already around, namely, have been used for other purposes &#8212; that we might apply them to whatever of the families that I mentioned a moment ago.&nbsp; But the other is to use the replication cycle of the virus &#8212; similar to what we did with HIV and what we&#8217;re doing with COVID-19 &#8212; to be able to develop antivirals against the whole family.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s just, kind of, a snapshot of the plan that the NIH just recently put out.</p>



<p>With regard to the budget, I mean, obviously it&#8217;s too early to talk about that because we&#8217;re in negotiations right now for what our budgetary needs are.</p>



<p>Thank you.</p>



<p>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Next question, please.<br><br>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Let’s go to Meg Tirrell at CNBC.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; One for Dr. Fauci and one for Dr. Walensky.</p>



<p>For Dr. Fauci: Are you expecting we&#8217;ll see an efficacy update with the data for kids under five?&nbsp; I think a lot of parents are (inaudible) unsure about how optimistic they should be feeling right now, when the last update we got was that the immune-bridging study didn&#8217;t meet goals.&nbsp; So, are you expecting to see that we&#8217;ll actually see this prevent cases of COVID?</p>



<p>And then, for Dr. Walensky, can you give us an update on BA.2 &#8212; its prevalence and your expectation for how it could affect, sort of, the curve of this Omicron wave?<br><br>DR. FAUCI:&nbsp; Yeah, Meg, thank you.&nbsp; I mean, obviously, we are anticipating that we will get a good efficacy signal for the use of vaccines in children under five years old.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But, right now, as you know, the FDA is looking at the data very carefully and, in their typical fashion, they will be very careful in scrutinizing the data and making a recommendation and a decision based on that data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, I don&#8217;t want to get ahead of them.&nbsp; But, of course, we&#8217;re anticipating we will get a vaccine efficacy signal that would allow for the use of this vaccine in children.&nbsp; But let&#8217;s wait for the FDA determination and, ultimately, the CDC recommendation.</p>



<p>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Dr. Walensky?</p>



<p>DR. WALENSKY:&nbsp; Yeah, great.&nbsp; Thank you, Meg, for that question.</p>



<p>So, our genomic surveillance now is detecting BA.2 projecting around 1.5 percent in this country.&nbsp; Of course, that varies for different parts of the country, but around one of &#8212; 1.5 percent projection of the sequences that we&#8217;re seeing.</p>



<p>What we know about BA.2 so far is that it does have a modest transmission advantage over BA.1.&nbsp; However, it&#8217;s not nearly the transmission advantage that we&#8217;ve seen between Omicron and Delta.</p>



<p>In terms of early studies, we have not seen any studies that suggest it’s more severe, nor have we seen studies that suggests that it will evade our vaccines any more so than Omicron has already &#8212; and, in fact, that our vaccines will work just like it has with Omicron.<br><br>So, in terms of how we anticipate this will impact cases: In many places we&#8217;ve seen BA.2 so far, cases have continued to come down, although at a slower rate.</p>



<p>In some case &#8212; in some countries, like Denmark, cases have gone up associated with BA.2, but that&#8217;s also in the context of relaxing mitigation strategies, mitigation measures, which is why we&#8217;re currently keeping those in place, among the reasons.</p>



<p>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks.</p>



<p>SURGEON GENERAL MURTHY:&nbsp; Jeff, can I add though &#8212;</p>



<p>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp;&nbsp;Please, Dr. Murthy.</p>



<p>SURGEON GENERAL MURTHY:&nbsp; &#8212; one point to Meg’s question?</p>



<p>Meg, at the heart of your question I think is something that many parents may be wondering about, which is: What&#8217;s changed between December when Pfizer shared their news and now?</p>



<p>And they&#8217;re &#8212; it&#8217;s a big change that&#8217;s happened, which is we experienced the Omicron surge.&nbsp; And with many children in particular, as well as adults, being infected and ending up in the hospital during the Omicron surge, it turns out that has actually facilitated the collection of important clinical data, additional clinical data that we did not have in December.&nbsp; Whether that changes the risk-benefit profile is what the FDA will be assessing.&nbsp; But there has been developments since December on the data front.<br><br>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Next question, please.<br><br>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Let’s go to Jacqueline Howard at CNN.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you for taking my question.&nbsp; I understand that, earlier this week, governors who met with the President expressed that they were seeking more clear guidelines from the White House on what the transition out of the pandemic and into a greater state of normality might look like.</p>



<p>Obviously, I know we&#8217;re not quite there yet.&nbsp; But my question is: When might we see such guidance?&nbsp; And can you give us any insight into if and how those guidelines will be prepared?&nbsp; What metrics will be considered?&nbsp; And how will that guidance be communicated to state leaders and to the public?&nbsp; Thank you.<br><br>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Well, as you as you can see from the discussion today, right now our focus is on fighting Omicron.&nbsp; While cases are coming down, as Dr. Walensky pointed out, there&#8217;s still a high level of hospitalization, largely driven, as the data shows, by the unvaccinated.</p>



<p>At the same time, we are always, you know, planning for the future.&nbsp; The most important thing that we have now, when comparing to a year ago, are the tools to protect people:<br><br>The vaccines and the effectiveness that we&#8217;ve talked about, particularly with boosters that offer the highest level of protection; a pediatric vaccine on the horizon; and treatments, including pills that are highly effective against severe disease and hospitalization.</p>



<p>So, we are in a much stronger position than a year ago.&nbsp; We have 210 million people fully vaccinated, including 75 percent &#8212; three out of four &#8212; of every adult.&nbsp; We had less than a percent when the President took office a year ago &#8212; people vaccinated.&nbsp; So, from 1 percent up to 75 percent of adults.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ninety-eight, ninety-nine percent of schools are open.&nbsp; That number was 46 percent when the President took office.</p>



<p>We have free tests, free masks, and booster shots widely available.</p>



<p>So, our progress over the last year and the tools we now have certainly allow us to get closer to a time when COVID doesn&#8217;t disrupt our daily lives but is something we protect against and treat.</p>



<p>And as we make more progress against Omicron, we&#8217;ll, you know, get closer to that point.</p>



<p>Next question, please.<br><br>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Let’s go to Zeke with AP.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; I was wanting to follow up on Jeff’s last point there and maybe get the doctors’ input as well.</p>



<p>In terms of that pathway to that vision of a point where COVID-19 doesn&#8217;t alter Americans&#8217; daily lives, you know, for many over the past couple of years it feels a little bit like, you know, the Charlie Brown football here, where it&#8217;s, you know, “Get vaccinated.&nbsp; (Inaudible) you need to get a booster.&nbsp; But even if you&#8217;re vaccinated and boosted, you still need to wear your mask to protect people who aren’t vaccinated.”<br><br>Is there a sense yet that you can offer the American public based upon your studies, based upon what you now know about Omicron &#8212; you know, is this the last wave?&nbsp; Is there enough that you can say, by a point certain, COVID will not impact people&#8217;s daily lives anymore?&nbsp; And if not, you know, why not?&nbsp; What else do you need to know?<br><br>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Dr. Fauci.<br><br>DR. FAUCI:&nbsp; Well, we have to be totally honest that we don&#8217;t know whe- &#8212; we believe that we are now going in the right direction.&nbsp; And the best-case scenario, as I and my colleagues have often described, is that with the tools that we have &#8212; the vaccination, the boosting, the testing, the masking, and all the other mitigations that we know about &#8212; when you have a level of community protection, which is the level of immunity throughout the community, that we will reach a stage &#8212; and I hope that it&#8217;s sooner rather than later &#8212; when, as you have said, this will not dominate our lives.&nbsp; In other words, it will be similar to the assimilation of this virus, in the group of viruses that we have learned to live with, without disruption of our society.&nbsp;<br><br>You know, the RSVs, the parainfluenzas &#8212; the influenzas where it&#8217;s there, it&#8217;s present, it hasn&#8217;t been eradicated, it hasn&#8217;t been eliminated, but it isn&#8217;t at a level that it essentially dominates what we do and dramatically influences our lives.&nbsp;<br><br>We believe we will get there.<br><br>We can&#8217;t guarantee that there will not be another variant that challenges us, but the best that we can do with that is to be prepared for it.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s why we&#8217;re doing all the things that we&#8217;re doing with regard to getting better, more advanced vaccine. &nbsp;For example, different platforms, different immunogen designs, development and discovery of new drugs &#8212; all of that will be part of the armamentarium that will ultimately, even with the appearance of additional variants, will get us to the point where we will not be dominated by this virus; where we can return to a degree of normality that we all crave for.<br><br>MODERATOR:&nbsp; All right, time for a couple more questions.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s go to Sheryl Stolberg at the New York Times.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks for taking this question.&nbsp; It&#8217;s for Jeff and for Dr. Fauci.&nbsp; Senators Murray and Burr have proposed a legislation that would create a task force to examine the initial emergence of the coronavirus and also assess the United States’ response across both the Trump and Biden administrations.&nbsp; It would be appointed by Congress, not by the White House.&nbsp; And I&#8217;m wondering &#8212; to Jeff: Is this something that the President supports?&nbsp; And for Dr. Fauci: Do you think it&#8217;s necessary to conduct an inquiry into the origins of the virus?<br><br>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Well, Sheryl, thanks for the question.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s start with &#8212; you know, we share the senators’ focus.&nbsp; A lot of the bill is about building stronger public health systems.&nbsp; And we appreciate the bipartisan goals to ensure the country is better prepared for outbreaks in the future, like COVID.&nbsp;<br><br>Right now, as we&#8217;ve been talking about, our, you know, focus is 100 percent on fighting Omicron and COVID.&nbsp; And while cases are coming down, the hospitalizations, as we discussed, are still quite high.&nbsp;<br><br>And across time, we do look forward to engaging with Congress and reviewing lessons learned from this pandemic.&nbsp;<br><br>So, I think that right now our focus is on Omicron, but we appreciate the work the senators have done and look forward to working with them.<br><br>Dr. Fauci?<br><br>DR. FAUCI:&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; Sheryl, I think it&#8217;s important to look at every aspect of this outbreak for lessons learned that is not only what the origin of the virus and the origin of the outbreak is, but many other things that we could learn from in the future so that we can prevent something like this happening or respond better if and when it does.</p>



<p>One of those is understanding what the origin of the virus is.&nbsp; And it’s very important.&nbsp; For example, studies were done with the first SARS-CoV-1 that we experienced in 2002 and 2003, and there was a mystery about how that happened.&nbsp; And then finally, after a lot of studies that actually took years to finally show that the origin was from a bat to an intermediate host to a human, very likely in a wet-market-type situation.</p>



<p>That was very important because that led to things that unfortunately were not followed, namely a better control in regulation of the wild animal trade and the interface between humans and animals.</p>



<p>The other one was MERS, in which it was shown finally that this was a bat reservoir that very likely infected camels and camels to human.</p>



<p>That also provides public health guidelines for the interaction of an animal-human interface.&nbsp; So, it would be, obviously, important to be able to determine how this went from what was very likely an animal reservoir &#8212; given the similarity with bat viruses &#8212; how that happened to go into humans to lead to this outbreak.</p>



<p>Understanding that will help us to prepare for any future outbreak, as well as prepare for a response.&nbsp; So, I’m definitely in favor of that.</p>



<p>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Kevin?</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Last question.&nbsp; Let’s go to Peter Sullivan, The Hill.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, thanks.&nbsp; There’s &#8212; a group of Democrats in Congress have called for $17 billion in the next appropriations package for global vaccinations and other aspects of the global response.</p>



<p>I’m wondering if the White House supports that, and are you planning to, you know, ask Congress for that in the next package.&nbsp; Thanks.<br><br>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; So, we have what we need in this current fight against Omicron, and we’ve done a lot to prepare for what’s ahead.&nbsp; We have boosters for all Americans, we’ve secured 20 million doses of the highly effective Pfizer pill.&nbsp; We’ve expanded supplies and stockpiles of PPE, including masks and gloves.</p>



<p>So, while we have enough money, enough funding for the current, immediate needs, we need to continue &#8212; as we’ve talked about &#8212; to stay ahead of the virus.&nbsp; And we are looking at a future where we will likely need funding for treatments and pills; we’ll need funding to continue to expand testing and to continue to lead the effort, as we’ve done with 1.2 billion doses donated to the world, but to continue to lead that effort to vaccinate the world.<br><br>So, we will be working with Congress as needed to make sure we have the funding to continue to fight this virus.<br><br>I want to thank everybody for the questions and look forward to the next briefing.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>3:44 P.M. EST</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">East Room</p>



<p>2:06 P.M. EST<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Thank you, thank you, thank you.&nbsp; I&#8217;m Joe Biden, Jill Biden’s husband.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; I want to thank you, Doctor, for that introduction.&nbsp; But I want to thank you more for all the effort you put in to change, save, alter people’s lives and your dedication to it.<br><br>And as we used to &#8212; I used to say in the Senate and I think it’s still said in the Senate &#8212; &#8220;if you excuse the point of personal privilege,&#8221; I&#8217;d like to &#8212; see that doctor on the end there?&nbsp; That&#8217;s the man who spent 18 months trying to save our son&#8217;s life.&nbsp; Doctor, I love you.&nbsp; The whole family loves you.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>Folks, the doctor’s optimism and fearlessness embodies what our Cancer Moonshot is all about.&nbsp;<br><br>And, of course, I want to thank Jill and Kamala and Doug.&nbsp; They just shared how personal it is for them and our families and &#8212; like so many of you.&nbsp; Every one of you have a story.&nbsp; Every one of you have a story.<br><br>And our message today is this: We can do this.&nbsp; I promise you we can do this.&nbsp; For all those we lost, for all those we miss, we can end cancer as we know it.&nbsp;<br><br>I committed to this fight when I was Vice President.&nbsp; It&#8217;s one of the reasons why, quite frankly, I ran for President.&nbsp; Let there be no doubt: Now that I am President, this is a presidential White House priority &#8212; period.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>You know, with the bipartisan members of Congress &#8212; and I’ve &#8212; I don’t want to start, because I&#8217;ll leave somebody out.&nbsp; (Laughter).&nbsp; But, you know, Congress is here.&nbsp; And this is, they can tell you, one of the truly bipartisan issues in the United States Congress.&nbsp;<br><br>I know there are votes, but that includes Senator Patrick Leahy, Michael Bennet, Amy Klobuchar, Chris Van Hollen, Sanford Bishop, Representative Joyce Beatty, Barbara Lee, Jim McGovern, Donald Payne, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Bonnie Watson Coleman, Tom Cole, Brian Higgins &#8212; I said I wasn’t going to do this &#8212; (laughter) &#8212; Terry Sewell &#8212; Terry Sewell.<br><br>And it can be truly an American moment if it’s &#8212; I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ve left somebody out, for which I apologize.&nbsp; But this can really be an American moment that proves to ourselves and, quite frankly, to the world that we can do really big things.&nbsp;<br><br>You know, we&#8217;ve made enormous progress in the past 50 years since Congress passed the President &#8212; and President Nixon signed into law the National Cancer Act and declared war on cancer.&nbsp; We learned cancer is not a single disease.&nbsp; We used to think, at that time, it was a single disease.&nbsp; There are over 200, as you all know &#8212; 200 different types of cancer caused by different genetic mutations in our cells.<br><br>We discovered new medicines, therapies, early detection and prevention measures that extend lives and save lives.<br><br>In the first 25 years since the National Cancer Act, the death rate from cancer was largely unchanged.&nbsp; Then things began to change.&nbsp; The progress over the last 25 years &#8212; the death rate has fallen by more than 25 percent.<br><br>But here’s the deal: Despite the progress of lives extended and lives saved, cancer is still the number-two cause of death in America, second only to heart disease.<br><br>In the last two years of COVID-19 pandemic, it’s taken more than &#8212; the pandemic has taken more than 800,000 American lives.&nbsp; But that same period of time, cancer has claimed 1.2 million American lives year in and year out.<br><br>For too many patients and their families on &#8212; diagnosed with cancer, instead of hope, there’s also bewilderment.&nbsp;<br><br>Remember, Doc, you telling the family that you had to be able &#8212; we had to be able to ask questions and you were available, because it&#8217;s a hard road to understand and traverse:</p>



<p>The feeling of being on your own, a <s>static</s> [statistic] adrift in a sea of patients, frustrated that hospitals and doctors can&#8217;t only &#8212; easily share your medical records or help find answers when there&#8217;s &#8212; minutes count.<br><br>Having to advocate for even the most basic care and attention for your loved one.<br><br>A flood of information &#8212; a completely different language, in many cases &#8212; with no one to help you decipher it.<br><br>Being within reach of therapy &#8212; a therapy that&#8217;s too expensive or your insurance won&#8217;t cover it.<br><br>Despite all the progress, there&#8217;s still a sense of powerlessness, guilt that maybe you&#8217;re not doing enough because you don&#8217;t know enough, and fear.<br><br>So, when President Obama asked me to launch our Cancer Moonshot in our administration, our goal was to bring a new sense of urgency to make the system of prevention, research, and patient care to take advantage of the 21st century science and technology.<br><br>We began the process.&nbsp; Many of you in this room were a part of that.&nbsp; We harnessed the resources of the federal government to change the culture, increase cooperation among scientists, and break down some of the silos.<br><br>I&#8217;d note, parenthetically &#8212; I remember I wanted to transfer a particular scan from a hospital in Pennsylvania to a hospital in D.C., and I was told they couldn&#8217;t do it &#8212; wasn’t able to do it.&nbsp; Could transfer just about anything else in the world, but they couldn&#8217;t do it because the hospitals didn&#8217;t want the other hospitals to have access to their &#8212; because the patients could change their mind with all the records.<br><br>That included everything from making federally funded cancer research more accessible to the public, instead of hiding behind a paywall.&nbsp; We launched Trials.Cancer.gov so everyone can look up cancer clinical trials across the country and around the world.<br><br>I traveled the country, bringing together leaders of<br>healthcare, technology, education, business, and technology.<br><br>I visited most of the major cancer centers, literally, in the world; met with heads of state in those countries; and decided how we could work together to try to make progress.&nbsp; I remember a particularly good meeting in Australia.<br><br>One of the final pieces of legislation that President Obama signed into law was the bipartisan 21st Century Cures Act with the help of members of Congress, particularly &#8212; I don’t know if &#8212; is Fred Upton here?&nbsp; Fred, are you here?&nbsp; Well, Fred Upton was part of it and Diana DeGette in the House.<br><br>It streamlined the Food and Drug Administration –- the FDA &#8212; so that new cancer treatments can be evaluated faster.<br><br>It provided seven years of new funding, including research on cancer disparities, trial networks to discover new drugs, and new efforts for childhood cancer.<br><br>The president of the Senate &#8212; as president of the Senate, I presided over the overwhelming vote, after the election had already taken place &#8212; the presidential election &#8212; when everything is supposed to come to a screeching halt &#8212; a bipartisan vote to fund over $6 billion.&nbsp;<br><br>And I watched my friend &#8212; and he is my friend; we disagree a lot &#8212; Mitch McConnell stand there and ask unanimous consent to name the cancer provisions after our son Beau.<br><br>The Cancer Moonshot brought the country and the world closer together on this issue.<br><br>And when we left office, Jill and I knew we had to keep it going.&nbsp; So, we took &#8212; and a lot of you &#8212; we had five Nobel laureates and others who were involved, through the cancer &#8212; the Biden Cancer Initiative.&nbsp; We focused on turning the Moonshot into a movement to create the cancer research and care system that most people think we already have and that they all deserve, but they don’t know they don’t &#8212; we don’t have it until they try to deal with it.<br><br>And everywhere we’d go, people would share their stories &#8212; in grocery stores, airports, rope lines.&nbsp; And while we heard stories of loss and despair, the stories began to change just a little bit &#8212; a change of feeling, real hope.<br><br>But not because of me and Jill, but because of all of you in this room and so many more at home: doctors, researchers, advocates, caregivers, patients, survivors.</p>



<p>And that’s why, today, I’m proud to announce our plan to supercharge the Cancer Moonshot as a central effort of the Biden-Harris administration.<br><br>It’s bold.&nbsp; It’s ambitious.&nbsp; But it&#8217;s completely doable.<br><br>Just as we harnessed the science to develop cutting-edge COVID-19 vaccines and treatments, we&#8217;ll bring a fierce sense of urgency to the fight against cancer.<br><br>The goal is to cut the cancer death rate in half in the next 25 years &#8212; at least by 50 percent &#8212; and to turn more cancers from death sentences into chronic diseases that people can live with; to create a more supportive experience for patients and their families; and, by doing these things and more, to end cancer as we know it.<br><br>And here’s what we’re fighting and how we know what cancer looks like today: a disease where we often diagnose it too late and we have too few effective ways to prevent it.<br><br>The stark inequities based on race, disparity, ZIP Code, sexual orientation, gender identity, and other factors still persist.</p>



<p>And we know too little about why treatments work in some patients and the exact same &#8212; that same patient with the exact same diagnosed cancer, it doesn’t work in that patient.</p>



<p>Where we still lack strategies to develop treatments for some cancers.&nbsp;<br><br>Where we don’t do enough to help patients and their families navigate through the process.<br><br>Where we don’t learn enough from patients&#8217; experience &#8212; experiences or their data.<br><br>In fact, when we first started this work, one of the first things we did was make sure that doctors and researchers work together, share information, allow patients to share their data<br>with other doctors and researchers to help others.&nbsp; But there’s so much more to do.</p>



<p>I remember when we were going through this in the Moonshot, and my saying that &#8212; I was told that “Well, patients don’t want to share their data.”&nbsp; They all want to share their data.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Sometimes you all don’t want to share what you know.&nbsp; (Laughter.)</p>



<p>And for each &#8212; (applause) &#8212; and for each of the ways we know cancer today, we know we can change its trajectory.<br><br>For example, to prevent cancer, scientists are exploring if the new mRNA vaccine technology that brought us safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines could also be used to stop cancer cells when they fail &#8212; when they first arise, get them then.<br><br>To target the right treatments to the right patients, we’re learning more about how to use genetics, immune response, and other factors to tell which combinations of treatments that are likely to work best for a particular individual.<br><br>To address inequities, we can target prevention, detection, and treatment efforts so that all Americans &#8212; whether they’re urban, rural, or Tribal communities &#8212; have equal access to cancer diagnostics, therapeutics, clinical trials.&nbsp; There’s so much more we can do.&nbsp;<br><br>And as I said at the beginning, this is a presidential priority.<br><br>I will do my part on funding and using my authorities as President to break logjams and speed breakthroughs.<br><br>I challenge and encourage all of you &#8212; all of you to continue to do your part.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This will be bipartisan.&nbsp; This will bring the country together and, quite frankly, other nations as well.</p>



<p>Here are some of the actions that I’m announcing today:</p>



<p>First, I’ve formed a new Cancer Cabinet, which is convened in the com- &#8212; we will convene in the coming weeks, to include members of the Cabinet who are here today &#8212; all of the people sitting on the stage here.&nbsp; They’ll drive a whole-of-government effort to unleash every possibility within our &#8212; within our power, within their jurisdictions.<br><br>The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, led by senior scientist and advisor, Dr. Eric Lander &#8212; sitting on the end there &#8212; will chart the path for the Cancer Moonshot for 2022 and beyond.<br><br>And I’m calling on Congress to fund my proposed ARPA-H &#8212; the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health.&nbsp; This will be a new kind of entity within the National Institute of Health &#8212; the NIH &#8212; with autonomy and authorities to drive unprecedented progress in biomedicine.</p>



<p>It’s based on DARPA.&nbsp; Most everybody knows, in this town, what DARPA is.&nbsp; That’s the Defense Department’s Advanced Research Project Agency that has led to breakthrough technologies that protect our national security &#8212; from the Internet, to GPS, and so much more.<br><br>ARPA-H will have a singular purpose: to drive breakthroughs to prevent, detect, and treat diseases, including cancer, Alzheimer’s, and diabetes, and other diseases.</p>



<p>And I think there’s strong bipartisan support for this, but it costs money.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s the best &#8212; these are the best dollars we could spend.&nbsp; So, we&#8217;ve got to get it done, and we got to get it done now and not wait any longer.<br><br>I&#8217;m also calling on the scientific and medical communities to bring the boldest thinking to this fight.&nbsp;<br><br>I’m calling on the private sector to develop and test new treatments, make drugs more affordable, and share more data and knowledge that can inform the public and benefit every company’s research.<br><br>And I’m respectfully calling on people living with cancer and caregivers and families to keep sharing their experience and pushing for progress.&nbsp; You&#8217;ll have a voice and a seat at the table, I promise you.&nbsp;<br><br>And here’s one thing we can all do: Americans have missed more than 900 &#8212; 9 million cancer screenings in the last two years because of COVID.&nbsp; Nine million.&nbsp; We have to get cancer screenings back on track and make sure that they are accessible to all Americans.<br><br>So, today, I’m announcing a call to action for cancer screening and early detection.<br><br>If you were supposed to get a cancer screening during the pandemic, call your primary care doctor today.</p>



<p>If you’re that doctor, talk to your patients.&nbsp; Get a screening scheduled, whether it’s in the office, at home, or through a telehealth visit.&nbsp; Because the Affordable Care Act now <s>will cover</s> [requires] most private insurance plans, as well as Medicare and Medicaid, to cover the recommended preventive care screenings free of charge.<br><br>I’m calling on companies, healthcare providers, non-profits, and others to step up, including developing mobile units and pop-up clinics to reach people where they live.<br><br>And if you’re putting off a screening because you’re afraid of what you’ll find &#8212; they&#8217;ll find &#8212; let me say this &#8212; and so many people are &#8212; put it off: Last November, I got a colon cancer screening.&nbsp; I’m glad I did.&nbsp; Trust me, I know cancer is scary.&nbsp; Going to the doctor’s can be scary.&nbsp; But screening is how you catch it early, before it’s too late.&nbsp; The earlier you get it, the better shot you have.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me close with this: There’s a quote that &#8212; when I made one of these speeches, years ago &#8212; five, six years ago &#8212;&nbsp;attributed &#8212; it was attributed to Yo-Yo Ma.&nbsp; I later was informed it was attributed to Vince Lombardi.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; But whoever the hell gave the quote &#8212; (laughter) &#8212; it makes sense.&nbsp; Here&#8217;s the quote, &#8220;Practice makes permanent.&nbsp; Only perfect practice makes perfect.&#8221;<br><br>My challenge to everyone involved in this fight against cancer: Take a hard look at your practice.&nbsp; Ask yourself, are you practicing perfectly or am I practicing to make the old way permanent?&nbsp; Old practices created data silos, minimized the role of patients, fostered the wrong kind of competition instead of the right kind of collaboration.<br><br>And I know we can get this right &#8212; I&#8217;m positive we can &#8212; by not losing sight of the ultimate goal: the patient’s health.&nbsp; And by not losing sight of something else I also believe: America is the single place on Earth &#8212; single country that can be defined, as I told Xi Jinping, by one word, “possibilities.”&nbsp; Possibilities.&nbsp;<br><br>When we work together in America, there is nothing &#8212; nothing beyond our capacity.&nbsp; Nothing.&nbsp; So, let’s show the world what’s possible.&nbsp; Let’s show the world that we&#8217;re committed.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s show that we can do big things &#8212; that in the United States of America, when we work together, there’s nothing beyond our grasp &#8212; I mean nothing beyond our grasp.&nbsp;<br><br>And I know of nothing, as I think my colleagues would say, that&#8217;s more bipartisan than take on this fight and fundamentally change cancer as we know it.<br><br>It&#8217;s a mission that can truly unify the nation, that shows us at our best, working together, and &#8212; rather than working against one another.<br><br>For every patient asking for one more day &#8212; I remember I&#8217;ve met &#8212; I met with over 3,000 researchers in the various organizations, and they&#8217;re good.&nbsp; They&#8217;re devoting their whole lives to try to save (inaudible).&nbsp; And they work really long hours, but they&#8217;re not practitioners.&nbsp; They’ve not had that patient come up and say, &#8220;Doc, can you give me just two more weeks so I can see my daughter married.&#8221;&nbsp; &#8220;Doc, all I need &#8212; can you do anything to give me just six more months to see the baby born.&nbsp; That’s all I&#8217;m asking for, Doc.&#8221;&nbsp;<br><br>There&#8217;s a sense of overwhelming urgency &#8212; overwhelming urgency if you’re patient or a family member of a patient.&nbsp; Every patient asking just for one more day.&nbsp; They&#8217;re not asking to “cure me.”&nbsp; One more day.&nbsp; One more week.&nbsp; &#8220;Can I get another year to be able to do &#8212; boom.&#8221;<br><br>For survivors and caregivers who carry the physical and mental scars of treatments and recovery, and for those who have lost, and for the ones we can save: Let’s end cancer as we know it.&nbsp;<br><br>I refuse to believe &#8212; I refuse to believe this is beyond our capacity.&nbsp; I refuse to believe it.<br><br>You know, when I put together the Cancer Moonshot, I was Vice President, and the President gave me authority to task anyone in the administration.&nbsp; And when they found out I had the Department of Energy and Ernie Moniz, when they found out I had NASA and a lot of other agencies, they looked at me like, &#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with you?&#8221;&nbsp;<br><br>I said, &#8220;Guess what?&nbsp; NASA knows more about radiation than all of you.&#8221;&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Seriously.&nbsp; And Ernie Moniz &#8212; we were at a place where you got a billion, billion calculations per second.&nbsp; And it goes on.&nbsp;<br><br>Skills people never thought would impact on this can do it.&nbsp;<br><br>So, my plea to you scientists is: Share data as best you can.&nbsp; My plea to my members in Congress is: Let&#8217;s fund this particular program and focus on it until we beat it.&nbsp;<br><br>And to the American people: Keep the hope alive.&nbsp; There is hope.&nbsp; There is hope.<br><br>And I&#8217;m confident &#8212; absolutely confident &#8212; if we make all our effort to deal with it, we can make fundamental changes in people&#8217;s lives and change the families in this country &#8212; in a much better position than they are today with regard to cancer.</p>



<p>Thank you all for being here.&nbsp; I appreciate it.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>Thanks, everybody.<br><br>Every time I&#8217;d walk out of my Grandpop Finnegan&#8217;s house in Scranton, he&#8217;d yell, &#8220;Joey, keep the faith.&#8221;&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; And my grandmother would yell, &#8220;No, Joey, spread it.&#8221;&nbsp;<br><br>Go spread the faith, guys.&nbsp; We can do this.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>(The President departs the podium and walks past the press.)<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. President, any comment on your decision to deploy troops to Eastern Europe?<br><br>MR. PRESIDENT:&nbsp; It was totally consistent with what I told Putin in the beginning: As long as he is acting aggressively, we&#8217;re going to make sure we reassure our NATO Allies and Eastern Europe that we&#8217;re there and Article Five is a sacred obligation.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">James S. Brady Press Briefing Room</p>



<p>12:35 P.M. EST</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Hi, everyone.&nbsp; Okay, as you know, today marks the second day of Black History Month.&nbsp; The President and Vice President are committed to fighting for equity, opportunity, and dignity for all Black Americans each and every day.</p>



<p>And yesterday, a couple of people asked me what we were doing, so I just wanted to give you a quick overview.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On Monday, the President issued a proclamation calling on the nation to celebrate the contributions of Black Americans, honor the legacies and achievements of generations past, reckon with centuries of injustice, and confront those injustices that still fester today.</p>



<p>The President, and Vice President, and First Lady, Second Gentleman, Cabinet officials, and White House staff will host meetings and activities this month centered around the 2022 Black History Month theme: “Black Health and Wellness.”&nbsp; This includes a focus on physical wellness, mental health, environmental justice, economic growth, and spiritual wellness.</p>



<p>White House senior staff will also host important stakeholder discussions on diversity in media, veteran wellness, and increased support for HBCU students.</p>



<p>Last but certainly not least, we will celebrate and acknowledge the invaluable role Black faith leaders have played in communities across the nation, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>



<p>This is, of course, just brief overview.&nbsp; Stay tuned for more announcements.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Zeke, with that, why don’t you kick us off?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; With the announcement this morning that the President authorized the deployment of 3,000 troops to Europe &#8212; the President previewed that announcement last week and then ordered it today.&nbsp; Is there something &#8212; some new piece of information or intelligence that he saw in the last few days that sort of went from being a notional thing to something that to &#8212; to an actual deployment?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I would not read this as a decision made based on any events over the last 48 hours or couple of days.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve been in discussion and under discussion with our partners and Allies in the region where these troops are going for several weeks now.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I would just outline for you &#8212; I know some of you may have watched John Kirby&#8217;s briefing, but just to give some more specifics: A thousand service members from the U.S. Army&#8217;s 2nd Cavalry Regiment, which is based in Germany, will reposition to Romania in the coming days.&nbsp; Secretary Austin had discussed this possibility and this deployment to Romania last week in his conversation with the Romanian Defense Minister.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Second, we are moving 1,700 service members from Fort Bragg to Poland, and approximately 300 service members from Fort Bragg to Germany.&nbsp; Both of these moves are to supplement existing U.S. force presence in Poland and Germany.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These forces are separate and in addition to the 8,500 personnel in the United States on heightened alert position &#8212; posture that we announced last week.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But I would also note, Zeke, just to finish &#8212; the answer &#8212; answering your question that, you know, the President has been clear since the beginning of the escalation and the building of troops at the border, and been directly clear with President Putin in &#8212; as he was in really December: If Russia stays on an escalatory path, which they clearly have, we will make force posture adjustments to deter and defend against any aggression.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is not troops that will go into Ukraine.&nbsp; They&#8217;re not fighting in Ukraine.&nbsp; These &#8212; this is us &#8212; this is the United States abiding by our commitments under Article 5 to support, reassure our partners in the region.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And for &#8212; what is the milestone the President is looking for to &#8212; for those troops to come back home?&nbsp; What is the &#8212; is it if Russia de-escalates, those troops would go back to their &#8212; to their bases?&nbsp; Is that &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I think, as you touched on, it&#8217;s not permanent.&nbsp; They&#8217;re not intended to be permanent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, again, we already had a troop presence in all of these countries where we are doing an increase in troops.&nbsp; So, I can&#8217;t give you an evaluation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Obviously, if Russia decides to de-escalate &#8212; to take de-escalatory steps, then certainly that would impact what the force posture needs are in other parts of the region.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator Hawley was out with a statement today saying that the &#8212; that the President should, sort of, take NATO membership off the table for Ukraine and that it wasn&#8217;t in U.S. interests to do that.&nbsp; Do you think that sort of rhetoric or, sort of, position by a U.S. senator right now is helpful in this &#8212; in this showdown between the West and Russia?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, if you are just digesting Russian misinformation and parroting Russian talking points, you are not aligned with longstanding, bipartisan American values, which is to stand up for the sovereignty of countries &#8212; like Ukraine, but others: their right to choose their own alliances and, also, to stand against, very clearly, the efforts or attempts or potential attempts by any country to invade and take territory of another country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That applies to Senator Hawley, but it also applies to others who may be parroting the talking points of Russian propagandist leaders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On a different topic, there&#8217;s been a lot of reporting in the last couple of days about how the U.S. is sitting, at per &#8212; on a per capita basis, with peer developed countries.&nbsp; The death rate in United States is far outpacing what’s being seen abroad, largely as a result of the lower vaccination and boosting rates here, as well as some other comorbidities and the like.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But does the President feel that he bears responsibility that, you know, a year into office, with this new wave, that the U.S. wasn&#8217;t better prepared and that more people are dying here on a per capita basis than are &#8212; than in Europe, for instance?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, the buck always stops with the President, and he would say that.&nbsp; But I would also tell you, Zeke, that the steps that we have taken to make progress, to prepare in the United States far outweigh what almost any other country in the world has done to date.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That includes ensuring that 87 percent of the population has had at least one dose; inclu- &#8212; continuing to increase the number of people who are boosted; ensuring we are taking steps to keep our schools open, to make sure communities that have surges have the federal resources they need.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, of course, we are still at war with a virus; that is continuing.&nbsp; And it &#8212; and that is the President&#8217;s top priority.&nbsp; He has said that before.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But I would also note all of those steps that we have taken to ensure we are prepared as we have ups and downs in this pandemic.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, sorry, just one last one.&nbsp; Yesterday, you mentioned that it’s the policy of the administration not &#8212; to no longer comment on conversations with Joe Manchin about &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I didn’t say “Joe Manchin.”&nbsp; I said &#8212; you were often asking me about Joe Manchin, so I think that was the context of the question, which is absolutely fine.&nbsp; But it is our policy to not give specifics or to &#8212; to try not to give specifics of private conversations the President is having with members of the Senate, members of Congress.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are times &#8212; I know, yesterday, of course, we had Senator Grassley and Senator Durbin here, and we did a pool spray of that.&nbsp; So, you may say that&#8217;s contradictory, but our effort and our focus is on making progress, and sometimes that means keeping those conversations private &#8212; oftentimes.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, I&#8217;m just curious because this is a shift from where you were a few months ago.&nbsp; Is that only because the Build Back Better bill failed?&nbsp; Is that &#8212; is that why this policy has changed?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I think it&#8217;s a recognition that a lot more progress can be made when you&#8217;re having private discussions, and that the President&#8217;s focus &#8212; in terms of what we&#8217;re publicly communicating, how he&#8217;s speaking to the American people &#8212; needs to be on what he&#8217;s doing to make their lives better, not constant updates on the legislative process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.&nbsp; On the troops that were deployed today &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; you’ve said that they aren’t going to be fighting; they&#8217;ll be there to offer support.&nbsp; Can you offer any details about exactly what they will be doing there?&nbsp;</p>



<p>And also, about the distribution to these specific countries &#8212; why these three places?&nbsp; And why the 2,000 versus 1,000?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure, well, what &#8212; to be clear, they&#8217;re not going to Ukraine to fight, right?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Correct.&nbsp; Right.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; In a &#8212; so, I know that&#8217;s what you were asking, but just for clarity for the transcript purposes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, this &#8212; our effort and our objective here has been to ensure we are ready for every contingency, and force posture increases as part of that preparedness.&nbsp; It&#8217;s to reassure our Allies &#8212; to whom, as I&#8217;ve said, we have a sacred obligation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This force &#8212; or these forces who have gone are trained and equipped for a variety of missions: to deter aggression, and to reassure and defend our Allies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In terms of why the specific numbers, I&#8217;d really point you the Department of Defense, who makes the recommendations and, ultimately, you know, proposes for the President to sign off.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I would note that a number of our NATO Allies have recently announced troop movements as well, similar to what was announced this morning &#8212; so, including the United Kingdom, France, Spain, Denmark, and the Netherlands &#8212; of their intent to deploy additional forces to reinforce NATO&#8217;s easter flank &#8212; eastern flank as well.&nbsp; So, this is a reflection of our robust capabilities and our ability to distribute them across Europe, but it&#8217;s also consistent with a lot of &#8212; what a lot of our NATO partners are doing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John Kirby said that the Pentagon has not ruled out deploying additional troops.&nbsp; Under what conditions would that happen?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; These, again, are &#8212; these decisions were based on close consultations with our partners in the region; the countries where these troops have been deployed to, of course; and also, the escalatory actions by Russia.&nbsp; But, you know, obviously the President is meeting with his national security team on nearly a daily basis and will make evaluations as needed.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then changing the topics: Senator Luján has been hospitalized after suffering a stroke.&nbsp; In addition to offering well wishes, of course, some of his Democratic colleagues have said this is a reminder that in such a close Senate, any unexpected development could be a challenge to moving forward their agenda.&nbsp; So, has the President spoken with Senator Luján?&nbsp; And does he share similar concerns?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Not at this point.&nbsp; I &#8212; let me just reiterate &#8212; I know you referenced them &#8212; but that we have all been thinking of Senator Luján and his family.&nbsp; I know his team put out an update on his recovery last night.&nbsp; And he&#8217;s 49 years old, so I would also note that.&nbsp; But I would point you to them for any specifics on his status.&nbsp; Of course, we&#8217;re thinking about him, his family, his entire team at this point in time.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m not sure what you&#8217;re referring to in terms of concerns about &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, Senator Coons brought up yesterday that, you know, this could be a challenge for moving forward since they &#8212; you know, that 50-50 split is so critical.&nbsp; So, is that something that the President has also considered?&nbsp;</p>



<p><br>MS.&nbsp; PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, life is precious, as we know.&nbsp; You&#8217;re most familiar with the average age of senators in the Senate, but that is true on both sides of the aisle.&nbsp; So, I would just say, we spend most of our time engaging in good faith about the President&#8217;s agenda and not making those calculations.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then just one more on the Supreme Court.&nbsp; Given the President&#8217;s commitment to diversify it, will he make similar pledges should he have another opportunity to nominate someone?&nbsp; For example, there&#8217;s never been an Asian American justice or an LGBTQ justice.&nbsp; So, will he make a similar pledge?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would say that &#8212; about judges or just in general, I would say that if you look at the President&#8217;s record of judges &#8212; circuit court judges, lower court judges &#8212; it speaks for itself.&nbsp;<br><br>He has had a enormous number of justices he &#8212; judges he has nominated who are people of color, who are women.&nbsp; He has nominated and confirmed an extraordinarily diverse bench of qualified individuals to serve on the courts.&nbsp; And that is certainly a priority for him.&nbsp;<br><br>I don&#8217;t have any new pledges to announce for you.&nbsp; But I think I would point you to his record, which speaks to his commitment to ensuring the court is more diverse &#8212; lower courts are more diverse, the higher courts are more diverse &#8212; and that that is something he certainly will continue to look at as a priority.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Oh, sorry.&nbsp; I’ll come back to you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That’s okay.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was just going to ask another follow-up on the troop movements.&nbsp; Is President Biden concerned that Putin might use them as a pretext to act against Ukraine?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I think what&#8217;s important to be very clear about here is that there is one aggressor here &#8212; that aggressor is Russia.&nbsp; They are the ones who have gathered tens of thousands of troops on the border.&nbsp; They are the ones who are threatening to invade a sovereign country.&nbsp;<br><br>NATO is a defensive alliance.&nbsp; The steps and actions we are taking are to provide reassurance and readiness to our partners in the region.&nbsp;<br><br>If Putin &#8212; President Putin and the Russians decide to de-escalate, that would be a welcome step.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And a follow-up on the energy issue.&nbsp; Qatar has said it will divert cargoes if needed but needs the U.S. to help mediate changes in supply contracts.&nbsp; Who is the U.S. talking to about diverting supplies?&nbsp; And are any countries willing to forego their Qatari supplies to help Europe?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I certainly understand the question.&nbsp; I would just note that we&#8217;re talking to a range of countries and suppliers, not any one individual country.&nbsp;<br><br>Obviously, Qatar is a large supplier of oil in the world, so that is certainly a statement of fact.&nbsp; But I don&#8217;t have any private &#8212; anything about our private conversations to read out from here.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And just a quick final one: Does Biden plan to watch the Olympics &#8212; U.S. athletes competing?&nbsp; I think it starts Friday.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yes, absolutely.&nbsp; We all do.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not going to rule out an Olympics outfit here.&nbsp; I would encourage all of you to do the same.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Yes, we are looking forward to it and to cheering on our American athletes who will be competing.&nbsp;<br><br>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just one more on the troop movements.&nbsp; Can you explain a bit more why the President decided to move unilaterally before NATO approved a multilateral deployment?&nbsp; I mean, you&#8217;ve talked often in here about how fiercely united the U.S. is with our NATO Allies.&nbsp; Is there a concern that this undercuts that sense of unity?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Absolutely not.&nbsp; And this is an important question because a lot of our NATO partners have done something &#8212; taken a similar step.&nbsp; In fact, five other of our NATO Allies have taken steps; the United Kingdom, France, Spain, Denmark, and the Netherlands have all said they have the intent to deploy additional forces to reinforce NATO&#8217;s eastern flank.&nbsp;<br><br>So, these decisions can be made on a unilateral basis by the United States or any of our NATO partners to boost up support.&nbsp; And obviously, the NATO Alliance as a whole would decide if there was going to be a movement of the NATO Alliance forces.&nbsp;<br><br>So, this is something that we have always had the capability to do, as an &#8212; as all these other countries do as well, and it&#8217;s an option, in addition to what we&#8217;ve done to support and plus up our NATO Alli- &#8212; our NATO partners &#8212; our NATO Alliance.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I think it&#8217;s still not clear though that &#8212; why?&nbsp; I mean, I know you&#8217;ve &#8212; we’ve been &#8212; you’ve been addressing this here.&nbsp; But why now, then &#8212; given that you&#8217;re saying there&#8217;s no new evidence that&#8217;s come to light, necessarily?&nbsp; It&#8217;s not that you have a sense that Putin is going to invade any more so than you thought a few days ago.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; That&#8217;s true.&nbsp; But &#8212; and I just noted that &#8212; that it wasn&#8217;t an event, because I think the way Zeke asked the question &#8212; “in the last day or two” or “over the weekend” or something like that.<br><br>There &#8212; this has been under discussion for some time now with our NATO partners and, of course, within the administration.&nbsp;<br><br>There &#8212; it is also true that it is &#8212; there’s no question that Russia and President Putin has continued to take escalatory, not de-escalatory, steps.&nbsp;<br><br>So, it is not that it is one moment.&nbsp; It is &#8212; we are looking at events over the course of time.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And at the risk of sounding like a broken record: On the Supreme Court search, has the President made any plans to meet in person with any of the nominees?&nbsp; Has he had any direct conversations with any of these potential candidates yet?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We’re just not going to provide updates from here on the process.&nbsp; Certainly, meeting with the nominees will be &#8212; well, obviously, with the nominee &#8212; but meeting with candidates will be a part of the process.&nbsp; But I don&#8217;t expect we&#8217;d provide a play-by-play on that from here.</p>



<p>Go ahead, Kaitlan.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; Two weeks ago, at his press conference, the President said quote, “We&#8217;re going to actually increase troop presence in Poland, in Romania…if in fact he moves,” referring to President Putin.&nbsp; He has not moved yet to invade Ukraine, as far as we know.&nbsp; So, can you explain, in the last two weeks, why that calculus has changed for President Biden?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I wouldn&#8217;t say the calculus has changed, as much as we look at a range of events over the course of time.&nbsp; And there&#8217;s no question that if you look at President Putin&#8217;s actions, they have been escalatory, not de-escalatory.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But clearly, he&#8217;s been &#8212; this has been a topic of discussion from &#8212; among our national security team and also between our national security team and their counterparts for some time now.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the President worried that Putin is going to try to invade a NATO Ally?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; The President wants to &#8212; we&#8217;re certainly hopeful he would not.&nbsp; But the President wants to take steps to reassure our &#8212; countries in the region that are part of the NATO Alliance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, you know, Russia is a country, President Putin is a leader who has invaded two sovereign countries in the last several &#8212; several years.&nbsp; You know, he&#8217;s somebody who has used chemical weapons.&nbsp; He&#8217;s somebody who has pushed propaganda around the world. &nbsp;<br><br>We&#8217;re not predicting that he has made a decision; we don&#8217;t know that.&nbsp; But we&#8217;re also taking the steps to be ready and to be prepared.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are removing these forces that are now being deployed &#8212; is that contingent on Putin removing his troops from Ukraine&#8217;s border?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Removing &#8212; oh, these troops &#8212; troops in Eastern Europe?<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 3,000 troops that the President is sending to NATO Allies that he signed off on yesterday, is that contingent on Putin de-escalating &#8212; not just de-escalating but actually removing his troops from the Ukrainian border?</p>



<p><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, if President Putin took de-escalatory steps, that certainly would impact our calculus.</p>



<p>But I don&#8217;t have anything to outline from here.&nbsp; That&#8217;s obviously a decision and recommendations that would be made by the Department of Defense.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; And one last question.&nbsp; Last week, I believe, in here, you said that you &#8212; the assessment still was that a Russian invasion is “imminent.”&nbsp; That&#8217;s the word that you used before, that other officials have used, and you used it last week.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But yesterday, the Ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said she would not use the word “imminent.”&nbsp; She said she does not think a Russian invasion of Ukraine is imminent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, I guess we just need some clarification on where that assessment stands right now.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I used that once.&nbsp; I think others have used that once.&nbsp; And then we stopped using it because I think it sent an &#8212; a message that we weren&#8217;t intending to send, which was that we knew that President Putin had made a decision.&nbsp;<br><br>I would say the vast majority of times I&#8217;ve talked about it, we said, “He could invade at any time.”&nbsp; That&#8217;s true; we still don&#8217;t know that he&#8217;s made a decision.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay, so you&#8217;re not using that word (inaudible)?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I think I used it once last week.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the decision now is that you&#8217;re not describing it as “imminent” anymore?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I haven&#8217;t in over a week.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead, Jen.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; Just another question, first on President Putin and, sort of, the message coming from Russia.&nbsp; He, yesterday, expressed hope for diplomacy.&nbsp; And after the U.S. announcement on troops today, the Russian Deputy Foreign Minister called the move “unjustified” and “destructive.”&nbsp; So how do you &#8212; what is your response to, sort of, their rhetoric of, you know, calling for diplomacy here, given what their posture is on the border of Ukraine?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I would say: Be very open-eyed about Russian propaganda and what they&#8217;re putting out there.&nbsp; We know what is happening on the border.&nbsp; Everybody can open their eyes and see they have gathered more than 100,000 troops at the border.&nbsp; They have also built up troops in Belarus at another border.&nbsp; That has not changed.&nbsp; We have not seen de-escalatory actions.&nbsp;<br><br>At the same time, we don&#8217;t know that President Putin has made a decision to act, and that ensures &#8212; means that we are going to, of course, continue to leave the door open to diplomacy.&nbsp; We&#8217;re going to continue to discuss and engage where we can find common ground with Russia &#8212; with Russian leaders.&nbsp; That doesn&#8217;t mean that we are going to bow to what their demands are on issues like NATO and what &#8212; and the right of any sovereign country to be able to choose which alliances they pursue.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve been clear on that from the beginning.<br><br>But, you know, diplomacy means you agree on some things, you disagree on others, you try to figure out where you have common ground, and that&#8217;s the process that we&#8217;re still undergoing.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On another subject, the House is working through the China bill right now, and there were some amendments that were released last night.&nbsp; There&#8217;s an effort by some House members to attach guardrails to CHIPS funding, which would mean they wouldn&#8217;t be able to get U.S. taxpayer dollars while also investing in China.&nbsp; Does the administration have a view on that?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I&#8217;m not going to get into any specifics about the negotiations that are ongoing.&nbsp; Certainly, the President is eager to sign the competition bill into law.&nbsp;<br><br>I would also note that Mr. McCarthy made clear he was going to whip against this bill, and let&#8217;s just think about how ludicrous that is.&nbsp; He is a leader in the Republican House.&nbsp; This is a bill that would help address supply chain issues.&nbsp; It would help make us more competitive with China.&nbsp; It would provide more than $50 billion in funding to ensure there&#8217;s chips manufacturing here in the United States &#8212; which would help, by the way, reduce and prevent inflation over time in an industry where one third of inflationary pressure is coming from, which is the car industry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, there are important discussions happening right now, but the whipping against this legislation &#8212; legislation that warranted a great deal of bipartisan support in the Senate &#8212; is certainly a question that hopefully House Republicans will have to answer for.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then just another China question on a little bit of a different subject, which is the COVID tests that are being sent out by the federal government.&nbsp; The Chinese company Andon Health owns iHealth, which is one of the providers.&nbsp; They have a &#8212; they signed a $1.3 billion contract with the Pentagon last month for these tests.</p>



<p>Is the administration concerned about, sort of, both the &#8212; the, sort of, optics and messaging of sending something to Americans&#8217; homes that says &#8212; says &#8220;Made in China&#8221; on it at the same time that you&#8217;re, you know, doing this thing that you consider to be a positive good for Americans, and just kind of the overall, you know, philosophy of giving federal contracts to China?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would say our objective continues to be to increase U.S. manufacturing capacity of tests.&nbsp; We also needed to meet a need that we had in this country for more tests and a shortage of tests and the understandable demand from people across this country to get tests and make them free and accessible, which required us purchasing some of those tests from China in order to meet that demand.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But that doesn&#8217;t change our commitment to increasing our U.S. manufacturing to ensure that we will be able to meet that demand with products made here in the United States over the course of time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; Yesterday, the national debt passed $30 trillion for the first time.&nbsp; Does the administration see that as a problem?&nbsp; Or do you share the view of some economists that debt doesn&#8217;t matter?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, the President believes we need to have a sustainable and responsible fixed fiscal policy, which is why he put forward ways to pay for his major proposals.&nbsp; He&#8217;s committed to a sustainable and responsible policy in ensuring that our long-term investments are fully paid for, like Build Back Better.</p>



<p>I&#8217;d also note that this stands in significant contrast from the previous administration and Republicans in Congress, which passed a $1.5 trillion tax cut for wealthy taxpayers in 2017 and didn&#8217;t pay for it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As we look to the debt, which obviously the President wants to be lower, it&#8217;s important to note that more than 95 percent of the national debt was incurred before he took office.&nbsp; The national debt increased by $7.8 trillion during former President Trump&#8217;s presidency, which accounts for about 30 percent of its total.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, we are working to address, we are working to be fiscally responsible, and that certainly is a priority to the President.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; One more on Afghanistan.&nbsp; There&#8217;s a new report out from the U.N. that says that more than 100 former members of the Afghan government and other Afghan allies of the U.S. have been killed since the Taliban returned to power.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are additional reports that thousands of Afghan allies of the U.S. are still in Afghanistan.&nbsp; They&#8217;re hiding out.&nbsp; They can&#8217;t get to the U.S. because of issues with a Special Immigrant Visa.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Does the administration consider it a priority to get these people out of Afghanistan?&nbsp; And if so, why are they still there six months after we withdrew?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We absolutely do.&nbsp; And we&#8217;ve &#8212; we have also helped thousands of our Afghan partners leave Afghanistan since our full withdrawal at the end of August.</p>



<p>As has been reported, there was a delay in &#8212; or there was a gap where there were not flights.&nbsp; Those have resumed, which is a good sign, which will hopefully enable us to continue to get more people out.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Obviously, the President also met with the Qatari leader earlier this week.&nbsp; They have been an important partner here, as we don&#8217;t have the diplomatic presence, as you well know, that we had prior.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I would just note that from the beginning, we&#8217;ve been able to evacuate more than 120,000 people from Afghanistan &#8212; some American citizens, many of them Afghan partners and allies, people who have fought alongside us during the 20-year war.&nbsp; And that is the largest evacuation since the Vietnam War.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, I would say we are still committed to doing this.&nbsp; We are not naïve about the challenges, nor are we naïve about the conditions on the ground, which is why we are so focused on getting humanitarian assistance to the people in Afghanistan through trusted and reliable sources.</p>



<p>But it is a good sign that the flights have resumed.&nbsp; Obviously, this was a topic of discussion with the Qataris earlier this week as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; Just on schools: New Orleans became the first major district in the country to have a vaccine mandate for all students go into effect yesterday.&nbsp; We know how you guys feel about the need to get vaccinated.&nbsp; But will the White House press other districts to follow in New Orleans&#8217;s steps?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We will always &#8212; we believe that it&#8217;s up to school districts to make decisions about what steps they put in place, and we would certainly advise all of them to follow CDC guidance.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the mandate: There are a number of exemptions that parents can apply for.&nbsp; It&#8217;s pretty easy to get an exemption.&nbsp; Does the White House think that sort of defeats the purpose of the mandate or is that okay?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We have exemptions that we implement in the federal government as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Staying on education: Yesterday, also, before the President paused student loan debt repayments &#8212; or, I guess, extended the pause in late 2021 &#8212; it was supposed to resume yesterday.&nbsp; Is the Department of Education pushing forward any other steps to make sure that when those payments relaunch in May, borrowers will be able to make them?&nbsp; Or will the President extend that pause again?&nbsp; Or is he still considering executive action to forgive student loan debt again?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; Well, I would note that no one has been required to pay a single dime of federal student loans since the President took office.&nbsp; As you noted, he extended that pause to May to give breathing room to borrowers who are still coping with the pandemic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He certainly also supports Congress for providing $10,000 in debt relief &#8212; a bill he would be happy to sign into law.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t have any additional executive orders to predict at this point in time.&nbsp; But certainly, in May, if these &#8212; if this resumes, the Education Department &#8212; the Education Department will continue working to ensure a smooth transition to repayment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; Last week, President Biden and President Zelenskyy discussed a macroeconomic package of assistance for Ukraine.&nbsp; What&#8217;s the status of those negotiations?&nbsp; What&#8217;s the scope and scale of that package?&nbsp; And what&#8217;s the holdup, given that the economic damage is happening in real time from the Russian threat and the U.S. already announced its economic package?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yes, we have been discussing with the Ukrainians an economic &#8212; a package of economic assistance.&nbsp; That package and discussion has been underway, obviously, with &#8212; at the leader level but also beyond.&nbsp; At this point in time, I think the discussion is with other counterparts from our government and theirs about next steps.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I mean, this was not the first economic package that we are providing to the Ukrainians.&nbsp; We have provided a significant amount of assistance &#8212; not just security assistance, but humanitarian and other economic assistance &#8212; over the course of time, so that would certainly build on that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But in terms of a next step, I can check and see if there&#8217;s any &#8212; anything specific to update you on.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; And just to follow up on the troop levels, why did the President authorize a deployment specifically to Poland and Romania?&nbsp; Are they considered the most vulnerable of the eastern flank countries &#8212; compared to, say, Hungary or the Baltics?&nbsp; And is it because the negotiations with the other countries haven&#8217;t worked out, or is it because these are considered the most vulnerable members?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I think as my colleague, John Kirby, conveyed, we&#8217;re also &#8212; we&#8217;ve left the door open to additional &#8212; I&#8217;ve nothing to predict on that front.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But this was based on &#8212; or this announcement and deployment was based on consultations and conversations with these countries where we have sent these troops.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have any more details about behind-the-scenes conversation to lay out from here.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; Senator Graham and Congressman Clyburn have been calling for educational diversity on the Court, suggesting the President should choose someone who attended a public university rather than an Ivy League school, for example.&nbsp; As the graduate of a public university &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Me too.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; does the President &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Who else here?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; does the President have any &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Public schools.&nbsp; (Laughter.)</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Inaudible) about the President.&nbsp; Does he have any thoughts on that as a graduate of a public university?&nbsp; Will that factor into his consideration at all?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure, I certainly understand the question.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve seen their comments.&nbsp; I would say the President&#8217;s &#8212; and we certainly appreciate Senator Graham&#8217;s thoughts and, of course, those of Mr. Clyburn.</p>



<p>What the President&#8217;s focus is on is choosing from a wealth of deeply qualified candidates who bring to bear the strongest records, credentials, and abilities that anyone could have for this role.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As you know, he has nominated judges who do not &#8212; have not gone to Ivy League schools.&nbsp; So I think that speaks to his value for that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But in terms of the credentials, I don&#8217;t have any more specifics to lay out for you today.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And related to that, though, I also just wanted to ask about candidates who have already gone through a judicial confirmation process &#8212; either for the district court level or the appeals court level.&nbsp; Is that something the President is going to be taking into consideration: whether they&#8217;ve already made it through the Senate Judiciary Committee once before?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; The President’s focus is, again, choosing from a wealth of highly qualified candidates who bring to bear strong records, credentials, and abilities to serve on the Court in a lifetime appointment.&nbsp; That is his focus &#8212; and also doing that through consultation with Republican and Democratic members of the Senate and experts, not on navigating the legislative process.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And shifting gears to one infrastructure question.&nbsp; The &#8212; a number of Florida Republicans have complained about the implementation of the new infrastructure law.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Who?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, certainly Governor DeSantis, Senator Rubio.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; What are their complaints?&nbsp; I haven&#8217;t even seen them.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, among the things they have complained about is they&#8217;ve suggested the state was shortchanged on bridge funding, that it should’ve gotten a bigger distribution.&nbsp; They&#8217;ve complained that the Everglades funding that was announced the other week should have been higher.&nbsp; Coming from Senators Rubio, Scott, and members of the House delegation who voted against the bill.&nbsp; Does the White House have any response to lawmakers who opposed the bill in the first place complaining that their share of the bill isn&#8217;t higher?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; It&#8217;s pretty rich, isn&#8217;t it?&nbsp;</p>



<p>I would say, first, I think the Everglades funding &#8212; I don&#8217;t have it in front of me, but I believe it&#8217;s in the billions, if I&#8217;m correct. You may have the exact number.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $1.1 billion.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; There is also an enormous &#8212; I mentioned this a little bit yesterday: About 90 percent of the competitive funding that&#8217;s available will go to localities, territories, others who can apply for it.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s why we put out this big book just a few days ago: so people know the criteria where they can apply for that funding.</p>



<p>You know, I think Mitch Landrieu, when he was here, quoted, I think, a Nancy Pelosi quote, so I&#8217;m just going to quote it.&nbsp; You know, I &#8212; you know, now I can&#8217;t even remember it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the point is, even if you vote against it, you still want the money.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve seen that over the course of time.&nbsp; That&#8217;s speaks to how political a lot of these votes were, given this is funding that will help rebuild a lot of these communities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And the President will certainly be making clear who was with him and who wasn&#8217;t with him.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And last week, the Vice President&#8217;s appeal to governors to help with the defense of voting rights &#8212; does the administration feel that the effort for national voting rights legislation is dead?&nbsp; And if so, is it now going to focus its efforts at state level?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We have to do both.&nbsp; So, federal legislation is important for a number of reasons, including that it creates a baseline of requirements &#8212; requirements or standards in states so people can know, who are fearful, about how they can vote; when they can vote &#8212; if you&#8217;re a mom of three kids, you should have a lot of options for dropping off your ballot or going to vote early; and ensuring those requirements are standard across states.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It also ensures that for states that have histories of voter suppression, that they would have to seek approval from the Department of Justice to make changes.&nbsp; That&#8217;s a good thing.</p>



<p>So, we are going to have to &#8212; we&#8217;re still fighting for those.&nbsp; The President has said he will fight for those until his last breath.</p>



<p>At the same time, what I think the Vice President was talking about and she will be playing a vital role in is working with states and localities on how we can fight against oppressive voter suppression &#8212; voter laws that are popping up in states; how we can empower and engage populations to ensure they know what their rights are.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So we&#8217;re ha- &#8212; we’re going to do both, and it&#8217;s important to do both.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And Mitch McConnell said today, given the current COVID facts and science, “It is time for the state of emergency to wind down.”&nbsp; Does the President agree with that?&nbsp; And is that still possible when there&#8217;s that hardcore of anti-vaccination people?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I didn&#8217;t see the full context of Mr. McConnell&#8217;s comments.&nbsp; I will say that the President&#8217;s view is that we&#8217;re not going to live like this forever; we don&#8217;t want to live like this forever.&nbsp; And our objective and our goal is on ending this pandemic as we know it today so we don&#8217;t have it &#8212; it is &#8212; so it&#8217;s not something that&#8217;s disrupting our daily lives.</p>



<p>We do more &#8212; we&#8217;ll do more and more to protect people and accelerate the path out of this pandemic.&nbsp; There is a lot of progress that&#8217;s been made.&nbsp; Two hundred and ten million people are fully vaccinated; that&#8217;s nearly 75 percent of adults.&nbsp; We had less than 1 percent vaccinated when the President took office.&nbsp; About 98 percent of schools are open.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And we understand the sentiment that I think he&#8217;s expressing, even if I haven&#8217;t seen the full context.&nbsp; We&#8217;re of course looking at, when the time comes, what it will mean to end the pandemic as we know it today.&nbsp; But right now, what our focus is on is ensuring we&#8217;re implementing the tools that we know that work as we&#8217;re still continuing to fight the virus.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead, in the back.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.&nbsp; The Pentagon says that Poland and Romania requested U.S. troops &#8212; U.S deployment.&nbsp; Have you received similar requests from other eastern flank countries, Baltic states?&nbsp; And what will trigger additional troops&#8217; deployment to the eastern flank?&nbsp; And I&#8217;m going to have one more.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; So, I&#8217;m just not going to detail those private diplomatic conversations.&nbsp; I would point you to the Pentagon if they want to share any more detail; I&#8217;d be surprised if they did.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But certainly we &#8212; those conversations are continuing; they&#8217;re not done. &nbsp;And I think my colleague, John Kirby, made that clear during his briefing today.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And one more.&nbsp; Has President Biden consulted this decision with the leaders of the Republican Party, and how does he feel about their support?&nbsp; Because there were some voices of the American Right questioning President Biden&#8217;s policy towards the Russia-Ukraine crisis.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would say that we have had an enormous amount of &#8212; we&#8217;ve done an enormous amount of briefing and engagement with Democratic and Republican leaders about the decision-making and how we&#8217;re approaching the escalatory nature of Russia&#8217;s behavior on the border.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Leader McCo- &#8212; or Senator McConnell made some comments in that regard last week.&nbsp; And this is an issue, in our view, that should not be partisan.&nbsp; What we&#8217;re doing here is we&#8217;re standing up for what have long been bipartisan American values, which is standing up for the sovereignty of a country; ensuring that they have the right and the ability to choose their own alliances; supporting them with a range of economic, humanitarian, and security assistance; and doing that in a way that&#8217;s coordinated with our partners and Allies.</p>



<p>There are some from the Republican Party who have not &#8212; not voiced support for that.&nbsp; And again, as I said a little bit earlier in the briefing, if you are echoing &#8212; if you are digesting Russian misinformation and parroting Russian propaganda, you may be on the wrong side of this issue.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi.&nbsp; Two questions.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first: Does the President know who Leonard Peltier is?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I&#8217;m sure he does, but I have not discussed it with him.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Just call me and let me know if he knows.</p>



<p>Is he aware of the push by Democratic senators and members of Congress and Native state legislators &#8212; and even Pope Francis, at one point &#8212; to send Peltier home from prison?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I have not discussed this with him specifically.&nbsp; I&#8217;m happy to see if there&#8217;s any more follow-up.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; And then my second question is about the Supreme Court.&nbsp; Some Republican senators, like Ted Cruz, are criticizing Biden for saying he&#8217;ll pick a Black woman for the Supreme Court. He said it’s, quote, unquote, “offensive,” because somehow the Black woman he chooses wouldn&#8217;t be the most qualified for the job.</p>



<p>But Republicans like Cruz also celebrated when Trump picked Amy Coney Barrett for the Supreme Court, with Cruz telling Barrett during her confirmation hearing, quote, “Your children have been wonderfully well behaved.&nbsp; I think you&#8217;re an amazing role model for little girls.&nbsp; What advice would you give little girls?”</p>



<p>So, my question for you is: Why do you think Republicans like Ted Cruz are acting so angry about Biden picking a Black woman for the Supreme Court, when they were very happy when Trump picked Amy Coney Barrett for the Court?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: I read that exact quote yesterday.&nbsp; I&#8217;m glad lots of people are following it.&nbsp; You know, I think that&#8217;s really a question for Senator Cruz.&nbsp; But it is important to note, as you just did in your question, that there has never &#8212; there was never an objection by Senator Cruz to Donald Trump promising he&#8217;d nominate a woman in 2020.&nbsp; You noted what he said to the woman he nominated in the hearing and how he applauded her in the hearing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The notion &#8212; the President&#8217;s view is the notion that there has not been a Black woman ever on the Supreme Court in 230 years is a problem with the process, not a lack of qualified, credentialed people to consider and nominate.</p>



<p>And, you know, that&#8217;s his view, but I think that&#8217;s a question best for Senator Cruz.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why do you think &#8212; what&#8217;s the difference between Trump picking Amy Coney Barrett and saying he&#8217;d pick a woman in advance, and Biden picking a Black woman and saying &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; That&#8217;s exactly why I called out this issue yesterday.&nbsp; But I am blissfully not a spokesperson for Senator Cruz, so he can best answer that question.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All right, thanks, everyone.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, just a quick question.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator Schumer is apparently coming here today to meet with the President about the Supreme Court pick and process.&nbsp; Can you confirm that?&nbsp; Do you have any other information on what their conversation (inaudible)?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I believe it was under discussion to figure out how they could connect, whether it was on the phone or in person.&nbsp; Let me see if I can get more details on it, but it&#8217;s part of the consultation process that you&#8217;ve seen take place over the past couple of days.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Thank you, everyone.</p>
