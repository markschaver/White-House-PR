<p class="has-text-align-center">Via Teleconference</p>



<p>3:03 P.M. EDT<br><br>     MR. ZIENTS:  Good afternoon.  And thanks for joining us.  Today, Dr. Walensky will share the latest on the state of the pandemic and the BA.2 variant, Dr. Fauci will then discuss NIH’s critical role in the research development of COVID therapeutics, and Secretary Becerra and I will discuss the clear consequences if Congress fails to provide more funds for the COVID response.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me start by emphasizing a consistent message you’ll hear from each of us: We urgently need additional funding from Congress to continue our fight against COVID.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We’ll start with Dr. Walensky.&nbsp; Dr. Walensky?</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DR. WALENSKY:&nbsp; Thank you, Jeff.&nbsp; And good afternoon everyone.&nbsp; I’m delighted to be back with you this week.&nbsp; Let’s start by walking you through the latest data.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have seen cases decrease dramatically over the past few weeks.&nbsp; And our national numbers remain close to historic lows, which is really encouraging.&nbsp; In some areas, we are now recording small increases even as cases continue to fall in other areas.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We continue to closely monitor data from all of our incoming sources, including waste water surveillance, cases, and hospitalizations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nationally, the current seven-day daily average of cases is about 28,600 cases per day, a decrease of about 9 percent over the previous week.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The seven-day average of hospital admissions is about 1,900 per day, a decrease of about 23 percent over the previous week.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And the seven-day average daily deaths are about 900 per day, which is a decrease of about 26 percent over the previous week.&nbsp;</p>



<p>CDC has been closely tracking the BA.2 sublineage of the Omicron variant carefully.&nbsp; The variant has been in the United States for about the past two months, and it has been slowly increasing in proportion compared to BA.1.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This week, we estimate that BA.2 represents about 35 percent of circulating variants nationally.&nbsp; As we&#8217;re learning from our colleagues in Europe, Asia, and South Africa, where BA.2 has resulted in varied peaks of cases, there&#8217;s no evidence that BA.2 variant results in more severe disease, nor does it appear to be more likely to evade our immune protection.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, it does have increased transmission in comparison to the related BA.1 Omicron variant that circulated in the U.S. this past winter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over the past week, we have seen a small increase in reported COVID-19 cases in New York state and New York City, and some increases in people in the hospital with COVID-19 in New England, specifically where the BA.2 variant has been reaching levels above 50 percent.&nbsp; This small increase in cases in the Northeast is something that we are closely watching as we look for any indication of an increase in severe disease from COVID-19 and track whether it represents any strain on our hospitals.&nbsp; We have not yet seen this so far.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nationwide, cases have been steadily decreasing since the Omicron BA.1 surge.&nbsp; While this is good news, we do expect that cases may continue to fluctuate, including increases in individual communities, which is exactly why the COVID-19 Community Level metrics are in place.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One way that CDC and our public health partners collaborate is by monitoring potential increases in cases and transmission is through the COVID-19 wastewater surveillance system.&nbsp; Currently, we&#8217;re seeing a modest uptick of sites reporting an increase of virus levels in wastewater in some communities.&nbsp; In fact, over the past two weeks, we&#8217;ve seen increasing wastewater signals in New York City and parts of New England, where we are now seeing increases in cases and some increased hospitalizations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But I want to emphasize that these upticks reflected minor increases from very low levels to still very low levels, but sustained trends over time can give us an early indication of COVID-19 infections in communities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So these are the areas that we are watching carefully, and an example of the interplay of our data systems that we use to inform our public health decisions.&nbsp; If cases do go up, we have the framework to implement additional layers of prevention strategies at the local level to swiftly protect individuals and communities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>CDC will continue to use all of the tools in our toolbox to closely keep an eye on any increase in COVID-19 in communities, including early indicators like wastewater surveillance, any uptick in cases and hospitalizations, and any changes in our genomic surveillance that monitors for circling variants.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I&#8217;d like to emphasize that if cases rise from the Omicron variant or any other variant, we have the tools, vaccines, boosters, tests, and therapeutics to be prepared.&nbsp; But continued investment in these tools so that they are readily available when we need them remains critical.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I know Jeff and the Secretary will talk more about the consequences of funding, but from a public health standpoint, it is critical that we continue to provide people with the tools to keep them, their families, and their communities safe.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thank you.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll now turn it over to Dr. Fauci.</p>



<p>DR. FAUCI:&nbsp; Thank you very much, Dr. Walensky.&nbsp; What I&#8217;d like to do in the next couple of minutes is to bring you an update on COVID-19 treatments.</p>



<p>If I have the next slide.</p>



<p>The medical management of individuals with SARS-CoV-2 are essentially threefold.&nbsp; One is to control symptoms, which is usually done as an outpatient for many &#8212; in fact, the vast majority &#8212; of people who are infected with SARS-CoV-2.&nbsp; With serious disease, there&#8217;s end-organ support that we&#8217;ve described in the past.&nbsp; But what I wanted to emphasize over the next couple of minutes is the issue of antivirals and immunomodulators, particularly the newest antivirals, with the purpose of keeping people out of the hospital.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Next slide.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As you can see from this schematic, we now have a number of antivirals in our toolkit for non-hospitalized patients with ca- &#8212; with COVID-19 during the Omicron era.&nbsp; And I want to emphasize “during the Omicron era” because several of the others &#8212; for example, some of the monoclonal antibodies &#8212; were negated by the evolution of the Omicron era.&nbsp; What you see on this slide are those interventions which clearly work well to keep people out of the hospital.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I want to emphasize for a moment, the one you see on the far right, bebtelovimab.&nbsp; I want to talk a little bit about that.</p>



<p>Next slide.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The FDA authorized this new monoclonal antibody for the treatment of COVID-19 that retains activity in the Omicron era, and it’s for individuals that are described on this slide with positive results of direct viral testing, at a high risk for the progression to severe disease, and for whom we do not have any other alternative therapies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is very important because &#8212; as shown on the next slide &#8212; as we get more variants, we have to make sure &#8212; and we have been fortunate for drugs like Paxlovid and others that they’ve maintained their efficacy against the variants as they’ve arrer- &#8212; as they’ve arisen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As you can see on this slide, there have been a number of evolution of variants.&nbsp; But note that the babted- &#8212; the bebtelovimab actually has no change in its ability to neutralize.</p>



<p>A word about this particular monoclonal antibody.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Next slide.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It was developed from antibodies from a recovered COVID-19 patient, which is generally the source of all of the monoclonal antibodies.&nbsp; It was developed in a collaborative operation with AbCellera and the NIAID Vaccine Research Center and ultimately developed by Eli Lilly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The reason I bring this to your attention is this is the kind of interaction and work that have been done in collaboration between the NIH and our industrial partners.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Getting back to what was said and what you will hear more of: It&#8217;s important to keep up these interactions, which is the importance for continued funding.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Next slide.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And in this regard, Secretary Becerra, who you’ll hear from shortly, announced the purchase of 600,000 of these treatment courses of this new monoclonal antibody.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve subcontracted for an additional 500,000.&nbsp; But, again, unless we get the funding requested of the Congress, we will not be able to continue to make these purchases.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Next slide.</p>



<p>I want to close by just mentioning something that will certainly come up with discussions.&nbsp; We continually get asked, “Will we all need a fourth COVID shot?”&nbsp; Now this is something that is obviously being pursued and examined from the standpoint of the data.&nbsp; Right now, a fourth shot is recommended for people with severe immunocompromised.&nbsp; Other nations, such as the UK, have recommended it for individuals who are elderly and also for those with immune compromise.</p>



<p>Here in this country, we&#8217;re looking at it and letting the data drive us.&nbsp; As you know, on April 6th, the FDA will call their VRBPAC to take a look at the long range of where we might go with new variants and where a fourth shot fits in with that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There&#8217;s also the immediate situation of looking at what we might do over the next few weeks to a month.&nbsp; And in that regard, two companies &#8212; Moderna and Pfizer &#8212; have submitted to the FDA for an EUA for the use of a fourth shot.&nbsp; What we can say today is that those data have been submitted, some are continuing to be accumulated, and will be appropriately evaluated, as we usually do, with the FDA and ultimately with the CDC.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And on the final slide &#8212; just another reminder, if you want to get information about the treatment guidelines, you can go to that website.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a long website.&nbsp; But if you don&#8217;t remember it, just put NIH.gov and it would lead you to that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I&#8217;ll stop there.&nbsp; And now back to you, Jeff.</p>



<p>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Well, thank you, Doctors.&nbsp; Over the past 14 months, we&#8217;ve made tremendous progress in our fight against COVID.&nbsp; Nearly 220 million Americans are fully vaccinated.&nbsp; Two in three eligible adults, including over 80 percent of eligible seniors, have now received a booster shot.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As Dr. Fauci just said, we have highly effective treatments, free and convenient tests, and high-quality masks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bipartisan support from Congress has been key to making this progress.&nbsp; But the President and the doctors have made it abundantly clear that we still have more work to do.</p>



<p>As Dr. Walensky just explained, we&#8217;re seeing BA.2 rise in Europe and in other parts of the world.&nbsp; And we know cases will fluctuate here at home.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If we maintain our preparedness, an increase in cases does not need to be a cause for alarm like it once was.&nbsp; We know what tools we need to fight the virus.&nbsp; Unfortunately, because of congressional action, we&#8217;re at risk of not having these tools readily available.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This should be unacceptable to every American.&nbsp; For months, we&#8217;ve made clear to Congress, on a bipartisan basis, that funding for core COVID medical supplies &#8212; including vaccines, treatments, and tests &#8212; was running out.&nbsp; Congress has failed to act.&nbsp; They failed to provide the necessary funding, and we&#8217;re already seeing the consequences.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let me turn to Secretary Becerra to describe what&#8217;s happening as a result of Congress&#8217;s failure to provide the necessary funding.</p>



<p>Secretary?</p>



<p>SECRETARY BECERRA:&nbsp; Thanks, Jeff.&nbsp; As Jeff has said, we&#8217;re in a new moment in our fight against COVID.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve reached this point because so many Americans have stepped up and done their part and because we&#8217;ve had the resources we need to protect our families and to save lives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On numerous occasions, at least six distinct times, Congress has been there to drive resources where they&#8217;ve been needed.&nbsp; The latest critical investment came with last year&#8217;s American Rescue Plan.&nbsp; I want to thank my former colleagues in Congress for the funding that has allowed us to execute on the President&#8217;s pandemic response.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Execution means administering more than 550 million shots in arms here at home, distributing more than 7 million treatments to patients across the country, making hundreds of millions of N95 masks and at-home tests available to the American people for free, and leaving no community behind, including by funding more than 1,400 community health centers so they can get vaccines, treatments, tests, and masks to patients without charge.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The President&#8217;s COVID-19 Preparedness Plan builds on these efforts to help America move forward safely, but continued execution requires continued support from Congress.&nbsp; And at this stage, our resources are depleted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The fund Congress established to reimburse doctors and other medical providers for COVID care for Americans &#8212; in particular, the uninsured &#8212; is no longer accepting new claims from providers for testing or for treatment services, as of yesterday.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The fund will also have to stop accepting new claims for vaccination services on or about April 5th.&nbsp; This means doctors, nurses, pharmacists, labs, and other healthcare providers will no longer get payments through the fund for providing these pandemic services to Americans.</p>



<p>On monoclonal antibody treatments, we have had to cancel a purchase for additional supplies of these treatments which had been planned for this week.&nbsp; Our current supply of these therapeutics is projected to start to run out by late May.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the consequences of diminishing supply or the resources to plan ahead and invest in future needs is that, on Monday, we had to cut the supply of monoclonal antibody treatments that we had distributed in the past to every state.&nbsp; That distribution to each state was reduced by 35 percent.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We’re also having to scale back our plans to purchase more doses of AstraZeneca’s preventive therapies for Americans who are immunocompromised.&nbsp; This increases the risk of having an insufficient supply of this treatment by the fall of this year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The President’s COVID team at the White House and HHS has briefed Congress on a number of occasions in great detail on our pandemic preparation, response, and the status of resources.&nbsp; We’ve provided information orally and in writing to members as requested.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our success in fighting COVID depends on our continued vigilance, our unwavering support for our scientists, our healthcare heroes, our essential workers, and our families navigating this COVID world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We&#8217;re prepared to execute the President&#8217;s plan.&nbsp; We look forward to working with Congress, our state and local partners, and every responsible American to come out of this pandemic in a better place.</p>



<p>Back to you, Jeff.</p>



<p>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Thanks, Secretary.&nbsp; I want to outline additional impacts that will occur over the coming weeks and months if Congress does not provide the appropriate level of funding for the continued fight against COVID.</p>



<p>Let me start with vaccinations.&nbsp; We have enough supply for the immunocompromised to get a fourth dose and, if authorized in the coming weeks, enough supply for fourth doses for our most vulnerable, including seniors.&nbsp; So we have enough inventory of vaccines to support possible fourth doses this spring.&nbsp; However, if the science shows that fourth doses are needed for the general population later this year, we will not have the supply necessary to ensure shots are available, free, and easy to access for all Americans.</p>



<p>Without more funding, we can&#8217;t procure the necessary vaccine supply to support fourth shots for all Americans.&nbsp; Furthermore, if things change and there&#8217;s a need for a new vaccine, a new formulation &#8212; for example, a variant-specific vaccine &#8212; we won&#8217;t be able to secure doses for the American people and we won&#8217;t be able to ensure America is first in line for them.</p>



<p>Not having enough vaccines is completely unacceptable, as vaccines have proven to be our single most important tool in protecting Americans.&nbsp; We should be securing additional supply right now.</p>



<p>Many other countries are already doing so.&nbsp; In fact, Japan, Vietnam, the Philippines, and Hong Kong have already secured future booster doses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Beyond vaccines, without additional funding, we can&#8217;t sustain the domestic testing manufacturing capacity we&#8217;ve built over the past year.&nbsp; And because it takes months to ramp back up to rebuild capacity, failure to invest now will leave us with insufficient testing capacity and supply if we see another surge in cases and demand for testing increases once again.&nbsp; That should not be allowed to happen.</p>



<p>To summarize the consequences of congressional inaction are severe and they are immediate: the uninsured fund is winding down, fewer lifesaving monoclonal treatments are being sent to states, fewer treatments available for the immunocompromised, and we risk not having sufficient vaccine supply or testing capacity.&nbsp; These consequences will only get more significant over time, with less treatments, vaccines, and tests for the American people.</p>



<p>Congressional inaction also hampers our global response.&nbsp; We all know this virus knows no borders, and leaving large unvaccinated populations worldwide will increase the risk of new deadly variants emerging that could put Americans at risk.</p>



<p>Under President Biden&#8217;s leadership, we&#8217;ve donated 1.2 billion vaccine doses to the world with more than 500 million doses already delivered to 113 countries.&nbsp; The challenge now is turning these vaccines into vaccinations &#8212; though without more funding, we can’t extend the support to under-vaccinated countries that they need this year to get shots in arms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The bottom line is we&#8217;ve made tremendous progress across the last 14 months in the fight against COVID.&nbsp; And the President has a plan to sustain and build on this progress and ensure we remain prepared in the face of this very unpredictable virus.&nbsp; But we need Congress to act and provide $22.5 billion in immediate emergency funding so we can execute on the plan, so we can be prepared for whatever comes next.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Importantly, those who have been on the frontlines, Republican and Democratic governors, hospitals across the country, teachers, and 200 leading public health experts have all called for additional funding for the COVID response.</p>



<p>Further congressional inaction will set us back, leave us less prepared, and cost more lives.&nbsp; There&#8217;s no time to waste; Congress needs to act.</p>



<p>With that, let&#8217;s open it up for questions.&nbsp; Over to you, Kevin.</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Thanks, Jeff.&nbsp; We have time for a few questions today.&nbsp; So, everybody, please keep their questions brief.</p>



<p>First, let&#8217;s go to Sabrina Siddiqui at the Wall Street Journal.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you as always for doing the briefing.&nbsp; I just wanted to circle back to the BA.2 variant.&nbsp; Is it your expectation that that will become the dominant strain here in the U.S.?&nbsp; And while cases overall, as you said, are in decline nationally, do you expect that we may still see an Omicron-type surge as we did in &#8212; over the winter?</p>



<p>And how are you defining, you know, the trans- &#8212; community transmission levels in terms of restrictions like masks?&nbsp; You know, to move from low to medium to high, is it &#8212; is it focused just on hospital admissions or is it &#8212; or is there a certain threshold or benchmark of cases that would necessitate, for example, bringing back masks?&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Dr. Walensky?</p>



<p>DR. WALENSKY:&nbsp; Yeah, thank you, Sabrina.&nbsp; So, we do anticipate and we have seen over the last eight weeks as we&#8217;ve been following BA.2 here that it is representing an increasing proportion of the cases that we have.&nbsp; Now, of course, that is a smaller number of cases, but we do anticipate over the weeks that we may see it become the predominant variant here as it has already in in the Northeast.</p>



<p>In terms of how we&#8217;re defining our &#8212; and what I will say, though, is &#8212; back to what Jeff and I just spoke about &#8212; should we see more BA.2, we actually have the tools &#8212; while it is slightly more transmissible than the original Omicron, our vaccines work, our boosters work, and it does not indicate more severe disease than the original Omicron.&nbsp; So those tools are going to be key in protecting ourselves and our communities against BA.2.</p>



<p>In terms of our COVID-19 community metrics, we look at hospitalizations for COVID-19.&nbsp; We look at hospital capacity.&nbsp; And importantly, we also look at cases.&nbsp; So all of those go into the formulation as we use those metrics for future guidance.</p>



<p>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Next question, please.</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Let’s go to Betsy Klein at CNN.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey, thanks for taking my question.&nbsp; Given Dr. Fauci’s remarks on the consideration of a second booster for adults, potentially within the next few weeks, and then your comments, Jeff, that there won’t be supply for Americans who aren’t seniors or immunocompromised without congressional action, should those Americans expect to pay out of pocket for an extra booster?&nbsp; And will there be vaccine supply for Americans who haven’t necessarily had a first, second, or third shot yet and chose to do so in the coming weeks?</p>



<p>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Yeah, so let me make it clear that we do have sufficient current inventory of vaccines, both at states and pharmacies, in other access points around the country, and in our central inventory for fourth doses if they&#8217;re called for this spring for our most vulnerable, including seniors.</p>



<p>Where we do not have sufficient doses is later in the year if there&#8217;s a &#8212; the science dictates that all Americans should get a booster or if there&#8217;s a need for a new formulation of the vaccine &#8212; a variant-specific vaccine, for example &#8212; then we will not have sufficient supply.</p>



<p>In terms of people getting their primary series &#8212; their first or second dose, or their first booster &#8212; we continue to have sufficient supply in the near term.</p>



<p>Next question, please.</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Let’s go to Peter Sullivan at The Hill.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, thanks.&nbsp; I wanted to ask, on the funding issue, Senator Romney said today that he&#8217;s expecting a new proposal from Democratic leadership.&nbsp; It sounds like with some new offsets in it.&nbsp; Is the White House involved in that new proposal?&nbsp; And, you know, do you feel like you need to engage on the offset question a little more, given that Republican senators still seem to be saying it needs to be offset?</p>



<p>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; So, let me just sort of step back and start with our Hill engagement and how long we&#8217;ve been at this.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve been extensively engaged with Congress for months now.&nbsp; And, you know, going back to just after the New Year, mid-January, we&#8217;ve been working with members of Congress, Democrats and Republicans, on the funding needs for the COVID response.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve hosted dozens of briefings, we&#8217;ve held more than three dozen conference calls, and we&#8217;ve shared more than a dozen funding tables.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve given Congress a full accounting of our &#8212; of every dollar that&#8217;s been spent on the COVID medical response and a full accounting of the entire American Rescue Plan, which, as you all know, goes well beyond the direct medical needs.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve also provided all the specifics of the planned additional funding &#8212; how it will be deployed against additional purchase of monoclonals and pills and vaccines, as we were just talking about.</p>



<p>In total &#8212; I brought it with us &#8212; we&#8217;ve sent 385 pages of documents and tables to Congress.&nbsp; So let me be very clear: Congress has all the information it needs, and we&#8217;ve been responding to questions for months now.&nbsp; Congress has had plenty of time to act.&nbsp; And time is of the essence, as we heard across the briefing today.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With every day that passes, we risk not having the tools we need to fight COVID.&nbsp; And the bottom line is just, you know, crystal clear here: The virus is not waiting for Congress to act.&nbsp; With every minute this funding request is stalled, we&#8217;re losing our ability to protect people and be prepared.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You know, in terms of offsets, this is emergency &#8212; this is an emergency funding request, and there has not been a need for offsets for an emergency funding request.&nbsp; So, we fully believe that Congress should act, they should fund the $22.5 billion, and there should be no need for offsets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Next question, please.</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Let&#8217;s go to Meg Tirrell at CNBC.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, thanks.&nbsp; I&#8217;m wondering if Dr. Fauci or Dr. Walensky could give us some reflections on the news from Moderna today of results they put out in a press release for kids under six for the vaccine.&nbsp; And then also for Jeff, for the Secretary: How does the funding situation impact the potential vaccine rollout for kids under six?&nbsp; Is there sufficient supply for them?&nbsp; And, you know, if there&#8217;s not vaccine being paid for in the same way by the government, could that affect kids being able to access vaccines too?</p>



<p>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Okay, Dr. Fauci, on the Moderna news.</p>



<p>DR. FAUCI:&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; Thank you for that question, Meg. So the data and the announcement made by Moderna reflects a study done in collaboration with the National Institutes of Health in which they looked at the effect of a 25 microgram dose of the Moderna product in children within the age group of six months up to six years &#8212; less than six, but from six months up.</p>



<p>The primary endpoint of the data was not an efficacy endpoint; it was immunogenicity to see if that dose in that particular cohort induced a response comparable to the higher dose that you see in the adults.&nbsp; And it met that primary endpoint.</p>



<p>Also, the safety profile was quite good &#8212; nothing more or less than you would naturally see with so many other vaccinations.&nbsp; However, there was enough events with regard to infection and enough people in the study that they were able to get an efficacy signal.&nbsp; But the efficacy signal was for infection and there was not enough or any severity of disease, either in the placebo or in the vaccine group, to make any determination of the efficacy against severe disease.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The efficacy against infection was 44 percent.&nbsp; Now, that may seem like a low number, but in the era of Omicron, this is actually quite comparable to the efficacy against infection in what we&#8217;re seeing now with other vaccines.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, the data looked pretty good.&nbsp; Right now, they&#8217;re going to make those data available to the FDA.&nbsp; They will be submitting within a reasonable period of time for an EUA for that particular group for that particular purpose.</p>



<p>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; In terms of the supply, we do have that supply secured for kids under the age of six, so that is good news.&nbsp; And we will be ready operationally if the vaccine &#8212; and when the vaccine is authorized and recommended.&nbsp; And we&#8217;ll have those vaccinations available at tens of thousands of locations across the country that parents know and trust.&nbsp; So, we are &#8212; we do have the supply secured, and we will be ready operationally.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Next question, please.</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Let&#8217;s go to Jeff Mason at Reuters.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; One follow-up on the issue of an additional booster.&nbsp; Isn&#8217;t it &#8212; if I understood this correctly, isn&#8217;t it possible, Dr. Fauci and Jeff, that there could be approval for everyone in the country to get a fourth booster coming up?&nbsp; And if that is the case, do we have &#8212; does the United States have enough vaccine for that?&nbsp; Not &#8212; and I don&#8217;t mean later in the fall, Jeff, but I mean like right now if that comes through.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And then one other question for Dr. <s>Lawensky</s> [Walensky].&nbsp; Could you let us know if the CDC is planning to lift the Title 42 order for all other migrants at the border?&nbsp; And if so &#8212; or if not, why or why not?&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Dr. Fauci.</p>



<p>DR. FAUCI:&nbsp; So, Jeff, when we were talking about the possibility in my brief introduction about the possibility of a fourth dose, there&#8217;s the immediate issue and question, and then there&#8217;s the long-range question.</p>



<p>The long-range question, I think is what you&#8217;re referring to, is the advisability or not of a fourth dose of vaccine for the general population.&nbsp; As I mentioned, the FDA will have a VRBPAC meeting on the 6th of April to look at what would be needed with regard to the kind of boost that would be needed, whether it would be variant specific or ancestral-strain specific, and for what population might it be needed in the long range.&nbsp; And in the long range, we&#8217;re talking, for example, towards the beginning of the fall, the end of the summer.</p>



<p>The situation right now of the data that they are looking at with regard to fourth doses from both companies &#8212; from both the companies of the mRNA &#8212; the two companies for mRNA, Moderna and Pfizer &#8212; they&#8217;re going to be looking at data that have been submitted by those companies to the FDA to make a determination if there will be a subset &#8212; perhaps the elderly or others.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And as I mentioned, we already know it&#8217;s already recommended for those with severe immune compromise.&nbsp; So, people need to understand the difference between what&#8217;s being looked at in the next few weeks for the immediate versus the long range, which would involve the question you also asked of Jeff: If a determination is made that we need to do boosters for everyone, will there be available supply?&nbsp;</p>



<p>But, Jeff, back to you.</p>



<p>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; I think you captured it well.&nbsp; I think that we do have a sufficient supply for what we anticipate could be authorized or rec- &#8212; and recommended in the coming weeks, months.&nbsp; However, when you get later in the year, if there is a vaccine &#8212; fourth dose recommended for all Americans, we need the funding to secure enough supply to ensure that we have sufficient doses for all Americans.</p>



<p>Over to you, Dr. Walensky.</p>



<p>DR. WALENSKY:&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; Thank you, Jeff.&nbsp; So we last reassessed Title 42 at the end of January.&nbsp; As you recall, that was just around or right after the peak of our Omicron surge, and we had hospital capacity challenges really across the country.&nbsp; That reassessment is due next week again, and we are currently reviewing the data and evaluating it right now.&nbsp; So, more soon to come.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>



<p>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Next question, please.</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; A couple of more questions.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s go to Victoria Knight at Kaiser Health News.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey, thanks so much for taking my question.&nbsp; As you guys outlined today, funds are running out to reimburse providers for COVID-related treatment of the uninsured.&nbsp; So what if Congress doesn&#8217;t act soon?&nbsp; What is the administration&#8217;s plan for this?&nbsp; And does this mean uninsured people will be left with big bills for COVID care?</p>



<p>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Secretary Becerra.</p>



<p>SECRETARY BECERRA:&nbsp; So we&#8217;re planning to continue to provide the different services that we have put in place over the last year.&nbsp; We&#8217;re going to continue to divert whatever resources we can to make sure we address the COVID needs of the American public.&nbsp; We’ll continue to provide assistance in regions of the country where COVID is still hitting hard and providing medical support where we can.</p>



<p>So we’ll continue to do everything we can.&nbsp; We&#8217;ll exhaust every dollar that we have.&nbsp; We&#8217;ll use every dollar that we can &#8212; that is flexibly available to continue to provide for the need.&nbsp; And we’ll also begin, if Congress continues to delay any additional funding &#8212; begin a process of outlining what it would take to continue to offer to the American people those vaccines, those treatments, those therapies that they are coming to rely upon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so, whether it is moving towards allowing Americans to purchase these through other means or secure them through other means, or whether it means getting the support from Congress that allows us to continue to offer those for free, we&#8217;re going to continue to do what we can to make them available so that every American can remain safe and healthy.</p>



<p>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Next question, please.</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Last question, let&#8217;s go to Gustau Alegret at NTN24.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you for this opportunity and for doing this.&nbsp; I have a couple of questions.&nbsp; Dr. Fauci, you mentioned the fourth vaccine shot.&nbsp; However, there&#8217;s still many Americans who resist being vaccinated &#8212; among them, millions in the Latino community.&nbsp; Why you think there is still this resistance among Latinos?&nbsp; And if I may, Secretary Becerra, could you send a clear message in Spanish, if possible, to those in this community to highlight the importance of being vaccinated.&nbsp; Gracias.</p>



<p>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Dr. Fauci.&nbsp;</p>



<p>DR. FAUCI:&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, for the first part of your question, it is interesting and noteworthy that we have tried to get the equity of the availability and implementation of vaccines in minority communities &#8212; African Americans, Hispanics.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve done actually quite well in the comparable percentage of non-minorities and minorities who get vaccinated to begin with.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the things that has not been as successful &#8212; and we&#8217;re trying our very best to counter that &#8212; is that boosters are not as much being implemented among minorities, including Hispanics compared to whites.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, we&#8217;ve done very, very well with the equity of the original regimen.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve got to do better when it comes to boosters.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re trying everything we can to get the message out of why it is so important.&nbsp; Because when you look at the data of what boosters do, particularly in the era of Omicron, boosters are extremely important.&nbsp; So that is a deficit that we are trying to correct.</p>



<p>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Secretary Becerra.</p>



<p>SECRETARY BECERRA:&nbsp; (Speaks Spanish.)</p>



<p>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Thank you, everybody, for the questions and for joining today&#8217;s briefing.</p>

<p>Madeleine Albright was a force.&nbsp; She defied convention and&nbsp;broke barriers again and again.&nbsp; She was an immigrant fleeing persecution. &nbsp;A refugee in need of safe haven. &nbsp;And like so many&nbsp;before her &#8212; and after &#8212; she was proudly American.</p>



<p>As the devoted mother of three beloved daughters, she worked tirelessly raising them while earning her doctorate degree and starting her career in American diplomacy.&nbsp; She took her talents first to the Senate as a staffer for Senator Edmund Muskie followed by the National Security Council under President Carter. &nbsp;And then to the United Nations where she served as United States Ambassador, and ultimately, made history as our first woman Secretary of State, appointed by President Clinton.&nbsp; A scholar, teacher, bestselling author, and later accomplished business woman, she always believed America was the indispensable Nation, and inspired the next generation of public servants to follow her lead, including countless women leaders around the world.&nbsp; Madeleine was always a force for goodness, grace, and decency &#8212; and for freedom.</p>



<p>As a mark of respect for former Secretary of State Madeleine Korbel Albright and her life&nbsp;of service to our Nation, I hereby order, by the authority vested in me as President of&nbsp;the United States by the Constitution and the laws of the United&nbsp;States of America, that the flag of&nbsp;the United&nbsp;States shall be flown at half-staff at the White&nbsp;House and upon all public buildings and grounds, at all military posts and naval stations, and on all naval vessels of&nbsp;the Federal Government in the District of Columbia and throughout the United&nbsp;States and its Territories and possessions until sunset on March 27, 2022.&nbsp; I also direct that the flag shall be flown at&nbsp;half-staff for the same length of time at all United States embassies, legations, consular offices, and other facilities abroad, including all military facilities and naval vessels and&nbsp;stations.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-third day of March, in the year of our Lord two&nbsp;thousand&nbsp;twenty-two, and of the Independence of the United&nbsp;States of&nbsp;America the two&nbsp;hundred and forty-sixth.</p>

<p>Madeleine Albright was a force.<br><br>Hers were the hands that turned the tide of history.<br><br>As a young girl, she found a home in the United States—after her family fled their home country of Czechoslovakia during World War II, and the Iron Curtain came down across Central and Eastern Europe. Her father, a diplomat, was marked for death by the Soviet regime. She spent the rest of her days defending freedom around the world and lifting up those who suffered under repression.<br><br>She was an immigrant fleeing persecution. A refugee in need of safe haven. And like so many before her—and after—she was proudly American.<br><br>To make this country that she loved even better—she defied convention and broke barriers again and again.&nbsp; As the devoted mother of three beloved daughters, she worked tirelessly raising them while earned her doctorate degree and started her career.&nbsp; She took her talents first to the Senate as a staffer for Senator Edmund Muskie, followed by the National Security Council under President Carter. And then to the United Nations where she served as U.S. Ambassador, and ultimately, made history as our first woman Secretary of State, appointed by President Clinton.<br><br>A scholar, teacher, bestselling author, and later accomplished businesswoman, Secretary Albright continued to advise presidents and members of Congress with matchless skill and diplomatic acumen.&nbsp; In every role, she used her fierce intellect and sharp wit—and often her unmatched collection of pins—to advance America’s national security and promote peace around the world. America had no more committed champion of democracy and human rights than Secretary Albright, who knew personally and wrote powerfully of the perils of autocracy.<br><br>Working with Secretary Albright during the 1990s was among the highlights of my career in the United States Senate during my tenure on the Foreign Relations Committee. As the world redefined itself in the wake of the Cold War, we were partners and friends working to welcome newly liberated democracies into NATO and confront the horrors of genocide in the Balkans.<br><br>When I think of Madeleine, I will always remember her fervent faith that “America is the indispensable nation.”<br><br>In the years after she left government, Secretary Albright never stepped away from that belief. &nbsp;As the Chairman of the National Democratic Institute for over two decades, and through other organizations she advised, she continued to champion democratic principles as vitally important to America’s interests in freedom, prosperity and security.<br><br>She continued to mentor and nurture new generations of foreign policy experts at Georgetown University, the Korbel Center for International Studies at the University of Denver, named after her father, and beyond.&nbsp; As always, she shared her insight and wisdom widely, but she was especially dedicated to supporting the next generation of women leaders, including through the establishment of the Albright Institute for Global Affairs at Wellesley College.<br><br>Madeleine was always a force for goodness, grace, and decency—and for freedom.<br><br>Jill and I will miss her dearly and send our love and prayers to her daughters, Alice, Anne and Katie, her sister Kathy, her brother John, her six grandchildren, and her nephews and grandniece.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>We knew that when Texas passed SB8, its extreme law that blatantly violates the constitutional right reaffirmed by <em>Roe v. Wade</em>, it would invite other states to follow.  Today, Idaho became the first state to adopt a similar law – a six-week restriction relying on private citizens to enforce the law.  This development is devastating for women in Idaho, as it will further impede women’s access to health care, especially those on low incomes and living in rural communities. <br><br>Over the last six months, Texas’s SB8 has had profoundly negative effects–with women forced to travel hundreds of miles to access care, and clinics in neighboring states seeing a significant increase in demand since the law went into effect.  This is unacceptable, which is why President Biden directed a whole of government response to protect women’s rights that are currently under attack.<br><br>The Biden-Harris Administration will continue to stand with women and support their right to make their own health care decisions, a constitutional right that <em>Roe v. Wade</em> reaffirmed nearly five decades ago. And the President again calls on Congress to act and send a bill to his desk to shut down these radical steps.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>Twelve years ago, I proudly stood beside President Barack Obama as he signed into law the most consequential expansion of health care in generations: the Affordable Care Act. With the stroke of a pen — after decades of tireless efforts — millions of Americans gained peace of mind. And because of my Administration’s efforts, including passing the landmark American Rescue Plan, we have lowered health care costs and made coverage more accessible than ever before — even amid a global pandemic.</p>



<p>The ACA delivered quality, affordable health coverage to more than 30 million Americans — giving families the freedom and confidence to pursue their dreams without the fear that one accident or illness would bankrupt them. This law is the reason we have protections for pre-existing conditions in America. It is why women can no longer be charged more simply because they are women. It reduced prescription drug costs for nearly 12 million seniors. It allows millions of Americans to get free preventive screenings, so they can catch cancer or heart disease early — saving countless lives. And it is the reason why parents can keep children on their insurance plans until they turn 26.</p>



<p>When I ran for President, I promised I would protect and build on Obamacare — and that’s exactly what my Administration has done. Thanks to the American Rescue Plan, ACA premiums are at an all-time low, while enrollment is at an all-time high. Four out of five Americans can find quality coverage for under $10 a month, and families are saving an average of $2,400 on their annual premiums — that’s $200 in savings every month that families can spend on gas, groceries, and other necessities. We lowered costs and increased enrollment to a record high 14.5 million Americans gaining quality health coverage last year — including nearly 6 million who enrolled for the first time — with an additional 18.7 million low-income Americans now covered by Medicaid expansion. We’ve also reached communities that have historically been left behind, with the HealthCare.gov enrollment rate increasing by 26 percent for Hispanic Americans and 35 percent for Black Americans.</p>



<p>We’ve made tremendous progress, but our work is far from over. Over the last 12 years, Republicans in Congress have voted more than 70 times to repeal the ACA, with no real plan to replace it. Just this year, a Republican senator shared his plan to repeal the ACA, strip protections from the 100 million Americans with pre-existing conditions, and jack up premiums. As Republicans try to raise health care costs for the middle class, Congressional Democrats and I will do everything in our power to protect and build on Obamacare’s landmark achievements.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Vice President Kamala Harris Announces Release of Plan During White House Event with Secretary Marcia L. Fudge, White House Domestic Policy Advisor Susan Rice, and Americans Impacted by Bias in the Appraisal Process</em></p>



<p>On June 1, 2021—the centennial of the Tulsa Race Massacre—President Biden announced the creation of the Interagency Task Force on Property Appraisal and Valuation Equity (PAVE) to develop a transformative set of actions to root out racial and ethnic bias in home valuations. Today, the Task Force is releasing the <a href="https://pave.hud.gov/">PAVE Action Plan</a> which, when enacted, represents the most wide-ranging set of reforms ever put forward to advance equity in the home appraisal process. The Task Force is co-chaired by U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Secretary Marcia L. Fudge and Domestic Policy Advisor Susan Rice.</p>



<p>A home appraisal is a critical element of the homebuying and lending process, intended to provide an independent, fair, and objective estimate of the market value of a property so that lenders can accurately evaluate risk. &nbsp;Homeownership is the primary contributor to wealth building for Black and brown households and continues to hold promise for building multigenerational wealth and housing stability for households of color. But, bias in home valuations limits the ability of Black and brown families to enjoy the financial returns associated with homeownership, thereby contributing to the already sprawling racial wealth gap. Today, the median white family holds eight times the wealth of the typical Black family and five times the wealth of the typical Latino family. According to a recent <a href="http://racialwealthaudit.org/downloads/RacialWealthGap.pdf">study</a>, eliminating racial disparities in the amount of wealth families gain from owning a home would narrow the wealth gap by an additional 16 percent between Black and white households and by an additional 41 percent between Latino and white households.</p>



<p>Just since the Task Force was launched, there have been numerous reports of Black homeowners receiving higher appraisals only after taking down family photos and having white families represent them in their stead. &nbsp;New research shows that mis-valuation in communities of color can be widespread. A recent report from <a href="https://www.freddiemac.com/research/insight/20210920-home-appraisals">Freddie Mac</a> found that appraisals for home purchases in majority-Black and majority-Latino neighborhoods were roughly twice as likely to result in a value below the actual contract price (the amount a buyer is willing to pay for the property), compared to appraisals in predominantly white neighborhoods. Similarly, a recent study from <a href="https://www.fanniemae.com/research-and-insights/publications/appraising-the-appraisal">Fannie Mae</a> examining refinance transactions found that white-owned homes are much more likely than Black-owned homes to be appraised at values that exceed algorithmic predictions.</p>



<p><strong>PAVE Action Plan</strong></p>



<p>The Action Plan details a set of commitments and actions, most of which can be taken using existing federal authorities, that will help every American to have a chance to build generational wealth through homeownership. You can read the full action plan at PAVE.HUD.gov.</p>



<p>Member agencies will take the following actions:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><strong>Make the appraisal industry more accountable.</strong> The Action Plan lays out steps to enhance oversight and accountability of the appraisal industry, which has long operated in a relatively closed and self-regulated framework and has not been effective at addressing deep-rooted inequities. Specifically, it commits federal agencies to create a legislative proposal to modernize the governance structure of the appraisal industry, and improves coordination and collaboration between federal enforcement agencies to better identify and redress discrimination in appraisals.</li><li><strong>Empower consumers with information and assistance.</strong> The Action Plan includes concrete efforts to empower homeowners and homebuyers on effective steps they can take when they receive a valuation that is lower than expected. For example, federal agencies commit to issue guidance and implement new policies to improve the process by which a valuation may be reconsidered.</li><li><strong>Prevent algorithmic bias in home valuation</strong><strong>.</strong> Federal agencies that regulate mortgage financing commit to including a nondiscrimination quality control standard as part of a forthcoming proposed rule establishing quality control standards on AVMs (Automated Valuation Models). This will ensure AVMs do not rely upon biased data that could replicate past discrimination.</li><li><strong>Cultivate an appraiser profession that is well-trained and looks like the communities it serves.</strong><em> </em>According to the Department of Labor’s Bureau of Labor Statistics, the appraiser/assessor profession is roughly 97 percent white, making it one of the least diverse professions in the country. The Action Plan lays out a series of actions to remove unnecessary educational and experience requirements that make it difficult for underrepresented groups to access the profession and to strengthen anti-bias, fair housing, and fair lending training of existing appraisers.</li><li><strong>Leverage federal data and expertise to inform policy, practice, and research on appraisal bias.</strong> The Action Plan proposes the development of an aggregated database of federal appraisal data to better study, understand, and address appraisal bias, complemented by a working group composed of subject matter experts from stakeholder agencies to develop a research agenda on appraisal bias.</li></ul>



<p>The PAVE Task Force has already made significant progress, and its commitment is ongoing. The Task Force identified several additional policy initiatives that may have the potential to make a significant difference in ensuring fair and accurate home valuations for all communities. These policy ideas require in-depth evaluation and research, greater input from stakeholders, and further exploration. The Task Force is committed to doing this work. As the Task Force transitions into the next phase of its work to advance equity in home appraisals, it will continue seeking opportunities to collaborate with lending institutions, philanthropy groups, academia, civil rights groups, advocates, and industry associations to create a coordinated approach in tackling this issue.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">James S. Brady Press Briefing Room</p>



<p>1:48 P.M. EDT<br><br>MR. MEAGHER:&nbsp; Hello, everyone. Good afternoon.&nbsp; As you can see things are changing and moving pretty rapidly around here today.<br><br>Obviously, we&#8217;ve had some last-minute adju- &#8212; adjustments to the briefing, which is why I&#8217;m up here today.&nbsp; I know folks might have some questions after the statement that we just released from Jen.&nbsp; And we in the Press Office are going to strive throughout the rest of the day to get you the answers to the questions you might have.<br><br>A few additions beyond Jen&#8217;s statement that I can provide right now.&nbsp; No members of the press who attended the briefing yesterday are considered to be close contacts.&nbsp; We are considering con- &#8212; or we are currently conducting contact tracing, and any member of the press who is considered to be a close contact will be contacted.&nbsp; But if a close contact is determined, it would &#8212; it would not be through yesterday&#8217;s briefing.&nbsp; So, we just wanted to be clear about that.<br><br>I&#8217;m going to speak briefly about the first day and a half of Judge Jackson&#8217;s committee hearing, and then I&#8217;m going to pass it over to National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, who will make some remarks at the top and then he&#8217;s happy to take some questions on the trip.&nbsp; And he has a hard out where &#8212; I&#8217;ll call it.<br><br>And then again, please let us know if you have any follow ups after the briefing.&nbsp; We&#8217;ll strive to get you answers, and we appreciate everybody&#8217;s flexibility today.&nbsp;<br><br>With that, just a couple of things from the first day and a half of Judge Jackson&#8217;s committee hearing.&nbsp; The President watched portions of Judge Jackson&#8217;s hearing yesterday and today and is proud of the way she is showcasing her extraordinary qualifications, her experience, and her even-handedness.&nbsp; Her dedication to following the facts, the law, and our Constitution as an independent judge is clear.<br><br>He was also moved by the grace and dignity she has shown, the deference to senators, and the level of detail she is offering, reinforcing the value of her experience, her intellect, and the strength of her character.&nbsp;<br><br>The President was particularly struck when, reacting to Senator Leahy raising the broad support she&#8217;d received from the law enforcement community, Judge Jackson spoke about her family members who have served as police officers, saying, &#8220;I know what it&#8217;s like to have loved ones who go off to protect and to serve, and the fear of not knowing whether or not they&#8217;re going to come home again because of crime in the community.&nbsp; Those are not abstract concepts or political slogans to me.&#8221;<br><br>As a former Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, President Biden also appreciated her respect for the intent of lawmakers and the text of the law.&nbsp; He appreciated Judge Jackson&#8217;s commitment to stay in the lane of judges prescribed by the Constitution and her highlighting the importance of precedent.<br><br>He was also struck by how she swiftly dismantled conspiracy theories put forward in bad faith.&nbsp; They&#8217;ve been debunked by numerous fact checks, experts, and the record itself.<br><br>In selecting Judge Jackson, President Biden sought the opinions of Republicans and Democrats, who made clear they wanted someone have deep experience in the mold of Justice Breyer.<br><br>Today&#8217;s testimony and Judge Jackson&#8217;s endorsements by leading conservative jurists and some of the biggest law enforcement organizations in our country make clear she is indeed in Justice Breyer&#8217;s mold.&nbsp;<br><br>And with that, I&#8217;ll turn it over to Jake, who has a topper for you, and then he&#8217;ll take some questions.&nbsp; Thanks.<br><br>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; Good afternoon, everybody.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll make a few comments, and then, as Chris said, I&#8217;d be happy to take your questions.<br><br>The President is heading to Europe tomorrow to reinforce the incredible unity we built with Allies and partners in response to Russia&#8217;s brutal invasion of Ukraine and to consult on next steps.<br><br>Let me take a moment to set the context for this trip. Russia intended to accomplish three basic objectives in launching its unprovoked attack against Ukraine: first, to subjugate Ukraine; second, to enhance Russian power and prestige; and third, to divide and weaken the West.<br><br>Russia has thus far manifestly failed to accomplish all three objectives.&nbsp; In fact, it has thus far achieved the opposite.<br><br>On the first, the brave citizens of Ukraine are refusing to submit.&nbsp; They&#8217;re fighting back.&nbsp; They&#8217;re defending their homes.&nbsp; They&#8217;re defending their cities.&nbsp; And although Russia may take more territory in these brutal military operations, it will never take the country away from the Ukrainian people.<br><br>On the second, Russian power and prestige has been badly depleted.&nbsp; The Russian military has dramatically underperformed.&nbsp; The Russian economy has been rocked by powerful sanctions.&nbsp; The Russian high-tech and defense sectors are being choked off from key inputs.&nbsp; And Russia is a pariah in the international community.<br><br>On the third, the nations of the free world are more united, more determined, and more purposeful than at any point in recent memory.<br><br>For our part, since President Biden and the United States began warning the world of impending Russian aggression back in November, we have clearly and consistently pursued three lines of effort: first, help Ukraine defend itself by supplying weapons and military equipment; second, impose severe and escalating economic costs on Russia through the application of unprecedented sanctions in close coordination with Allies and partners in Europe, the Indo-Pacific, and other parts of the world; and third, fortify NATO and the Western Alliance by enhancing our force posture on the eastern flank and making our allies more resilient against other forms of Russian aggression.<br><br>We&#8217;ve made decisive moves on all three fronts, and President Biden&#8217;s trip will involve further actions on each of these three fronts.<br><br>He will attend an emergency NATO Summit, joined by the leaders of the other 29 NATO Allies.&nbsp; He will join the G7 leaders.&nbsp; And he will address the 27 leaders of the European Union at a session of the European Council.&nbsp; He will have the opportunity to coordinate on the next phase of military assistance to Ukraine.&nbsp;<br><br>He will join our partners in imposing further sanctions on Russia and tightening the existing sanctions to crack down on evasion and to ensure robust enforcement.&nbsp;<br><br>He will work with Allies on longer-term adjustments to NATO force posture on the eastern flank.&nbsp; He will announce joint action on enhancing European energy security and reducing Europe’s dependence on Russian gas at long last.&nbsp;<br><br>He will announce further American contributions to a coordinated humanitarian response to ease the suffering of civilians inside Ukraine and to respond to the growing flow of refugees.<br><br>From Brussels, President Biden will travel to Poland, where he will engage with U.S. troops who are now helping to defend NATO territory, and he will meet with experts involved in the humanitarian response.<br><br>He will also hold a bilateral meeting with President Duda of Poland.<br><br>I&#8217;ll leave further details on the schedule and program for each of these aspects of the trip to our trusty Communications and Press team.<br><br>Let me close with this: There will be hard days ahead in Ukraine &#8212; hardest for the Ukrainian troops on the frontlines and the civilians under Russian bombardment.&nbsp; This war will not end easily or rapidly.<br><br>For the past few months, the West has been united.&nbsp; The President is traveling to Europe to ensure we stay united, to cement our collective resolve, to send a powerful message that we are prepared and committed to this for as long as it takes, and to advance our response on all three critical fronts that I&#8217;ve described: helping the Ukrainian people defend themselves, imposing and increasing costs on Russia, and reinforcing the Western alliance.<br><br>And with that, I&#8217;d be happy to take your questions.<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jake.&nbsp; The Russians and the Hungarians seem to be reluctant on imposing a ban on importing Russian oil and gas.&nbsp; Will this weaken the sanctions?&nbsp;<br><br>And would you call on the groups that the President is going to meet to exclude Russia from the G20, of course, group?&nbsp;<br><br>And do you think that an agreement with Iran could be reached without Russia?<br><br>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; So, when the President announced that the United States was going to ban the import of Russian oil and gas, he was very clear.&nbsp; He said that the United States is uniquely positioned: We are an energy producer.&nbsp; We can do this.&nbsp; We can take this step of banning the import of Russian oil and gas and coal and be able to withstand it, have resilience against it.&nbsp;<br><br>But he also recognized quite explicitly in that statement that some of our European Allies and partners would not be able to follow suit, and he was not going to pressure them to do so.&nbsp;<br><br>From his perspective, what we have achieved with our European partners &#8212; in terms of financial sanctions, export controls, and other measures to hit the Russian economy hard &#8212; have had unprecedented impact on a large economy at a scale we have never seen before.&nbsp;<br><br>And so, he believes that that is in fact increasing the costs on Russia; it is sharpening the choice for Russia.&nbsp; And he feels very good about where things stand today in terms of the unity and resolve of the Western alliance on sanctions.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>And as I mentioned in my opener, we will have more to say on sanctions in the coming days.<br><br>On the question of the G20, I will just say this: We believe that it cannot be business as usual for Russia in international institutions and in the international community.&nbsp; But as for particular institutions and particular decisions, we&#8217;d like to consult with our Allies, consult with our partners in those institutions before making any further pronouncements.<br><br>Finally, we believe that if there is an Iran nuclear deal that meets the standards the President has set to verifiably block the pathway of Iran to get to a nuclear weapon and put this program back in the box after President Trump let it out of the box when he left the deal back in 2018, we will do that deal because we believe it is in the American national security interest to do so.&nbsp; But we will not do that deal until it meets those objectives.<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, thank you very much.&nbsp; If you can tell us anything more about the sanctions &#8212; you did just say “further sanctions” &#8212; anything more about what areas that could be in, that would be great.&nbsp;<br><br>And the other thing is, there was a report out that British troops are basically secretly training Ukrainians to use this very sophisticated anti-aircraft weapons &#8212; the “Star,&#8221; I think, or “Start” or something like that.&nbsp;<br><br>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; Right.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are there any U.S. troops in Eastern Europe or anywhere else currently training Ukrainians (inaudible)?<br><br>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; So, as for the first question, I&#8217;m not going to get ahead of an announcement which will be rolled out in conjunction with our Allies on Thursday when the President has the opportunity to speak with them.&nbsp; That&#8217;s on a further package of sanctions.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>What I will say is that one of the key elements of that announcement will focus not just on adding new sanctions, but on ensuring that there is joint effort to crack down on inva- &#8212; evasion, on sanctions busting, on any attempt by any country to help Russia basically undermine, weaken, or get around the sanctions.&nbsp; That is an important part of this next phase.<br><br>We have applied an enormous amount of economic pressure.&nbsp; And in order to sustain and escalate that pressure over time, part of that is about new designations, new targets, but a big part of it is about effective enforcement and evasion &#8212; applying the lessons that we&#8217;ve learned from other circumstances where we have, in fact, imposed sanctions on countries.&nbsp; So, stay tuned for that.<br><br>On the question of U.S. troops, we do not have U.S. troops currently training Ukrainians.&nbsp; We do not have U.S. troops on the territory of Ukraine.&nbsp; We do, of course, have U.S. troops defending NATO territory, providing reassurance to our Allies, deterring Russian aggression.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>And, of course, the United States is playing a key role not just in the direct provision of military equipment to Ukraine but in the facilitation of military equipment provided by many of our Allies as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Yes.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, sir.&nbsp; Two questions, quickly.&nbsp; Moments ago, you said at the beginning that Russia would never take Ukraine.&nbsp; But does the President believe that Ukraine can win a military victory here?&nbsp; And if so, why haven&#8217;t we heard that from him thus far?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>And then my second question is: With regards to Russia and partnership with the United States and certain institutions, what does the President hope that Russia can bring to the Iran nuclear deal?&nbsp; What do they have to bring to the table after they have rightfully been made a pariah on the world stage?<br><br>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; So, I can describe to you what happened with the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action back in 2015.&nbsp;<br><br>One of the key roles that Russia played in the implementation of that deal was that Russia actually accepted the enriched uranium from Iran so that Iran’s stockpile &#8212; stockpile stayed below 300 kilograms total, meaning that stockpile was so small that Iran could not swiftly break out to a nuclear weapon.&nbsp; That is a key part of how we ensured that Iran&#8217;s nuclear program was in a box.<br><br>Now, we don&#8217;t have to rely on any given country for any particular element of the deal, but that is a role that Russia played in the past &#8212; a practical role that didn&#8217;t have necessarily political significance but did have that practical significance.&nbsp;<br><br>What I said was that Russia is never going to take Ukraine away from the Ukrainian people &#8212; never going to be able to subjugate the Ukrainian people.&nbsp; That was not a statement about particular slice of territory that a Russian advance could occupy for a period of time or about a particular battle that some Russian element could win.&nbsp;<br><br>I would refer you over to the Pentagon in terms of the best military analysis for how particular battles in particular fronts will play out.&nbsp;<br><br>But what &#8212; I will say this: Whether Russia takes a city or takes a town or takes more territory, they are never going to be able to achieve the purpose that they set out, which was to subjugate this country, to bring this country to heel, because the Ukrainian people have made very clear that they will not be subjugated, no matter what it takes.&nbsp;<br><br>Yes.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jake, thank you for being here.&nbsp; But to follow up on that question, is it the policy of this government that Ukraine should win this, it should reject Russia and regain its sovereignty and its freedom?<br><br>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; We&#8217;ve said from the outset that we are unwavering in our commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity within the internationally recognized borders of Ukraine.&nbsp; We remain committed to that as our proposition for this.&nbsp;<br><br>But in the immediate day-to-day of this conflict, our focus is on ensuring that Ukraine has the tools that it needs to defend itself and to be able to effectively ensure that Russia cannot achieve its objectives in Ukraine.&nbsp; That&#8217;s what we&#8217;re focused on right now.&nbsp;<br><br>But on the basic proposition of Russia&#8217;s &#8212; of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, from day one of the Biden administration, we have not wavered an inch on that.<br><br>Yes.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me follow up on one thing, Jake &#8212; on Article 5 and any cyberattack that comes now.&nbsp; Obviously, Russians have done it before; it wasn&#8217;t an Article 5 issue then.&nbsp; Does something in Ukraine now change the contour of a cyberattack against any member nation of a &#8212; of NATO become an Article 5 issue &#8212;<br><br>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; So, in the June summit last &#8212;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; having the President raise that just yesterday as dramatically as he did?<br><br>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; So, last June, when the NATO leaders gathered for the NATO Summit, President Biden &#8212; consulting with them, we put out a statement that spoke to cyberattacks and their relationship to Article 5.&nbsp; And we could see circumstances in which a collective response by the Alliance to a cyberattack would be called by an Ally.&nbsp; That is absolutely something where we and other countries could bring capabilities to bear to help a country both defend itself and respond to a particular cyberattack.&nbsp;<br><br>Now, that&#8217;s not necessarily the same thing as a military response.&nbsp; That response could take many different forms.&nbsp; But we have made clear through NATO documents now &#8212; not just last year, but going back years &#8212; that cybersecurity is an Alliance issue, is &#8212; it is an issue where, collectively, NATO is prepared to pull together both to enhance resilience, enhance defenses, and, if necessary, use the appropriate tools to respond.<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jake.&nbsp; It’s been just over a week since you met with your Chinese counterpart, a couple of days since the President spoke with President Xi.&nbsp; Have you seen any indications that China will or will not provide assistance to Russia?&nbsp;<br><br>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; I can&#8217;t make predictions going forward.&nbsp; What I can tell you is we have not seen since those meetings or since the President&#8217;s conversation with Xi the provision of military equipment by China to Russia.&nbsp; But, of course, this is something we are monitoring closely.&nbsp; We will continue to monitor it.&nbsp; And the President made clear to President Xi the implications and consequences of any such provision of equipment, and they very well understand one another.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And where does this fall on the agenda at the NATO Summit?&nbsp; Will there be an effort to try to put specific concrete steps in place if China does provide that assistance?<br><br>MR.&nbsp; SULLIVAN:&nbsp; The President will certainly consult on the question of China&#8217;s potential participation in the conflict of Ukraine while he&#8217;s in Brussels &#8212; he&#8217;ll do so with NATO.&nbsp; He&#8217;ll also do so when he addresses the 27 leaders of the European Union, because, on April 1st, the European Union is having a summit with China.&nbsp; And so, this will be an opportunity &#8212; Thursday &#8212; for the United States and our European partners to coordinate closely on what our message is.&nbsp; We believe we&#8217;re very much on the same page with our European partners, and we will be speaking with one voice on this issue.<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, I just wanted to follow up on your comment about shoring up the eastern flank of NATO.&nbsp; Are you &#8212; do you anticipate additional U.S. troop deployments to Europe?<br><br>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; Well, I think there are two issues that are important to lay out.&nbsp; One is: What&#8217;s required in the immediate term?&nbsp; And right now, Secretary of Defense, the Supreme Allied Commander of Europe believe that they have effective posture today for what&#8217;s necessary today.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>But, of course, that could evolve in the coming days and weeks, depending on Russia&#8217;s actions and depending on the overall threat picture.<br><br>The second is: What is the longer-term force posture &#8212; not just for this contingency, this emergency, this invasion, but over the course of time?&nbsp; That is something the President will discuss with his Allies at the NATO Summit on Thursday.</p>



<p>Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; And if I might ask a quick follow-up on Russian troop casualties &#8212; a Russian media report that the outlet blamed on hackers and withdrew suggested that suggested that almost 10,000 Russian servicemen had been killed and 16,000 had been wounded in Ukraine.&nbsp; Does that &#8212; is your assessment that that number is realistic?&nbsp; Or how bad do you think the casualty situation is for Russia?</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; I’d refer you to the Pentagon for precise casualty figures.&nbsp; We do believe it numbers in the thousands.&nbsp; But it is a necessarily imprecise analysis from our part to be able to get, you know, that number down to the precise figure.&nbsp; So, I would refer you over to the Pentagon for that.</p>



<p>Yeah?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President said yesterday, Jake, that cyberwarfare is a capability Putin has but has decided to not use yet in this iteration of this war, but administration sources have told us the Russians have this multi-phase plan to target critical infrastructure that is already underway.&nbsp;<br><br>I&#8217;ll give you a couple of specifics: Two weeks prior to the invasion, 21 U.S. energy companies targeted by hackers; they’re involved with LNG production.&nbsp;<br><br>March 9th, CISA and the FBI began working with an unnamed American pharmaceutical company whose top execs were targeted with malicious phishing attacks.&nbsp; Internally, the administration has attributed that to Russian intelligence.</p>



<p>I have a list of stuff that goes on and on here.&nbsp; Suffice it to say, this &#8212; how did these acts not constitute cyberwarfare so far already?</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; So, first, the President put out a statement yesterday &#8212; a very strong, clearly worded statement &#8212; in which he said, based on evolving intelligence, we believe that attacks could occur.</p>



<p>Now, the Russians have spent years preparing the ground for attacks &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But do you &#8212;&nbsp;</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; &#8212; trying to get inside systems.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; is the position that they are not already underway?&nbsp; Just want to clarify.</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; Well, I &#8212; what I think we would distinguish between is gaining access to a system, which could be used for a variety of purposes &#8212; intelligence collection or mere preparation for a future attack &#8212; and the actual disruptive, destructive type of attack of the kind you saw that shut down the Colonial Pipeline last year, for example, or attack JBS Foods.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s really that latter thing that we have not yet seen.</p>



<p>But how one defines cyberwarefare [sic] &#8212; warfare or cyberattacks, of course, is going to differ across individuals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The distinction the President was making was the distinction between all of that preparatory work, which has been ongoing for years and has, in fact, intensified, and the type of destruction or disruption &#8212; the launch of a particular form of malware, for example &#8212; that would result in the kinds of physical effects we&#8217;ve seen in past attacks.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So no successful attacks yet?&nbsp; Just want to clar- &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jake.&nbsp; I wanted to ask about talk &#8212; concerns about the use of nuclear weapons, including possibly smaller nuclear weapons.&nbsp; Can you just address those concerns and talk about how that might come up on this trip?</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; Well, President Putin, in the early days of the conflict, actually raised the specter of the potential use of nuclear weapons.&nbsp; It is something that we do have to be concerned about.&nbsp; Based on our current analysis, we have not changed our nuclear posture to date.&nbsp; But we are constantly monitoring for that potential contingency.&nbsp; And of course, we take it as seriously as one could possibly take it.</p>



<p>We will be consulting with Allies and partners on that potential contingency, among a range of others, and discussing what our potential responses are.&nbsp; But I&#8217;m not going to speak to that from this podium today.&nbsp; I&#8217;m going to let the President have the opportunity to speak with his fellow colleagues on what is a very weighty matter.</p>



<p>Yeah?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen was asked yesterday &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are Vladimir Putin’s days numbered, Jake?&nbsp; Are Vladimir Putin’s days in power numbered?<br><br>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; From our perspective, what happens with respect to the Russian political system is something that will be worked out inside Russia.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>What we can do is put forward our basic three lines of effort.&nbsp; That&#8217;s what we&#8217;re doing: helping the Ukrainians defend themselves, fortifying the NATO Alliance, and imposing costs and consequences.</p>



<p>MR. MEAGHER:&nbsp; We’ve got time for one more.&nbsp; We’ve got time for one more.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have two questions on Russia and North Korea and China.&nbsp; There is a report today that the North Korea’s cyber-hacking organization is related to Russians&#8217; cyber-criminal organization.&nbsp; Do you have any information on that?</p>



<p>And I follow up next.</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; I’m sorry, can you just repeat the question?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; North Korea’s cyber-hacking organization is related to Russian’s cyber-criminal organization.&nbsp; Do you have any information on this?</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; All I can say, generally, is that North Korea’s cyber capabilities have &#8212; have been manifest in the world and they work with all kinds of cyber criminals around the world, including Russian cyber criminals.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve got nothing further for you on that today.</p>



<p>Yeah, I’ll take one more.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jake.&nbsp; Do have any expectation &#8212; do you have any specific comments or expectations on the meeting between &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What specifically does &#8212; what specifically &#8212;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; between President Xi and President Zelenskyy that&#8217;s scheduled to happen soon?</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; Sorry, I told her &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, I’m sorry.</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; &#8212; that I would call on her &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jake.</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; &#8212; so I&#8217;ve got to &#8212; I&#8217;ve got to let her ask the question.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What specifically does the President hope to accomplish when he&#8217;s in Poland?&nbsp; And why did he feel that it would be helpful for him to go to Warsaw at this time, particularly when the Vice President was there less than two weeks ago?</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; So, first, Poland has taken the brunt of the humanitarian impact outside of Ukraine in terms of the refugee flows.&nbsp; Poland is where the United States has surged a significant number of forces to be able to help defend and shore up the eastern flank.&nbsp; Poland has to contend not just with the war in Ukraine but with Russia&#8217;s military deployments to Belarus, which have fundamentally changed the security equation there.</p>



<p>And so, for all of those reasons, we feel that it is the right place for him to go to be able to see troops, to be able to see humanitarian experts, and to be able to meet with a frontline and very vulnerable ally.&nbsp;<br><br>So, I’ll &#8212; I&#8217;ll leave it at that, guys.&nbsp; Thanks.<br><br>MR. MEAGHER:&nbsp; Thank you, everybody.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jake, is he meeting with refugees?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>(Mr. Sullivan returns to the podium to retrieve his facemask.)</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; Oh, sorry.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is he meeting with refugees, Jake?<br><br>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; We’ll &#8212; we’ll &#8212;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I thought you said &#8212; Psaki said that you&#8217;d tell us &#8212; you &#8212; you might be able to tell us today.</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; So, I think I said at the outset that we’ll go through the precise details of the schedule (inaudible).<br><br>2:12 P.M. EDT</p>
