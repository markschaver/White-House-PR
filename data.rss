<p>As part of the President’s America the Beautiful Initiative, the Biden-Harris Administration today launched an interagency effort, called the Federal Interagency Council on Outdoor Recreation (FICOR), that will work to create more safe, affordable, and equitable opportunities for Americans to get outdoors.</p>



<p>The FICOR – which includes leaders from the Departments of the Interior, Agriculture, Commerce, and Defense – will focus on improving access to nature, expanding outdoor recreation opportunities, and providing the public with improved and more affordable experiences on America’s public lands and waters.</p>



<p>Increasing access to outdoor recreation is one of the six areas of focus outlined in President Biden’s America the Beautiful Initiative. The FICOR will help coordinate policies, facilitate partnerships, and improve implementation on issues such as: &nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Investing in resilient recreation infrastructure, such as electric vehicle charging stations, trails, campgrounds, visitor centers, docks, and boating access;</li><li>Bolstering education and career opportunities in conservation, outdoor recreation, habitat restoration, and resource management work, and &nbsp;providing comprehensive visitor information for the hunting, fishing, hiking, biking, birding, climbing, and boating communities;</li><li>Cooperating with State, Tribal, territorial, and local governments, including those in communities near Federal lands and waters; and</li><li>Improving equitable access to Federal lands and waters and creating a welcoming visitor experience in collaboration with private, public, Tribal, and nonprofit organizations.</li></ul>



<p>The launch of the FICOR renews and re-energizes a body that was originally created in 2011 but was suspended by the previous administration. Prior to being suspended, the FICOR successfully launched <a href="https://www.recreation.gov/">recreation.gov</a>, helped the <a href="https://www.bea.gov/news/2021/outdoor-recreation-satellite-account-us-and-states-2020">Bureau of Economic Analysis</a> begin tracking outdoor recreation as an economic sector, and worked to establish the <a href="https://www.everykidoutdoors.gov/pass.htm"><em>Every Kid </em><em>Outdoors</em><em> Pass</em></a>.</p>



<p>With outdoor recreation continuing to grow rapidly as an economic sector, including by contributing <a href="https://www.bea.gov/news/2021/outdoor-recreation-satellite-account-us-and-states-2020">1.8 percent of GDP and generating $374.3 billion</a> in economic output, and America&#8217;s parks and public lands experiencing record-level visitation, the Biden-Harris Administration is taking unprecedented steps to expand equitable access to the outdoors and to protect natural, cultural, and historic resources.</p>



<p>In addition to launching the FICOR, the Administration has:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Launched historic investments through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law in the restoration of Federal lands and waters, including by improving availability of and equitable access to outdoor recreation opportunities</strong>.<ul><li>Commerce Secretary Gina M. Raimondo announced funding opportunities from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) $2.96 billion in Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funds to address the climate crisis and strengthen coastal resilience and infrastructure. Over the next five years, NOAA’s targeted investments in the areas of habitat restoration, coastal resilience, and climate data and services will advance ongoing Federal efforts toward building climate resilience. Projects focused on building “Climate Ready Coasts” will invest in natural infrastructure projects that power outdoor recreation along our coasts by restoring coastal habitats, removing marine debris, storing carbon, and creating jobs.</li></ul><ul><li><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/ceq/news-updates/2022/04/11/biden-harris-administration-launches-1-billion-america-the-beautiful-challenge-to-support-and-accelerate-locally-led-conservation-and-restoration-projects/">Established the America the Beautiful Challenge</a>, a $1 billion public-private competitive grant program which funds locally led, voluntary conservation and restoration activities, including the development of outdoor recreation access and workforce development. The <a href="https://www.nfwf.org/programs/america-beautiful-challenge">first round of grants</a> – totaling $85 million – will be released in November 2022.</li></ul><ul><li>The Interior Department announced more than $61 million in grant funding to communities in 26 cities to create new parks and trails, or substantial renovations to existing parks, through the <a href="https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/secretary-haaland-announces-61-million-increase-outdoor-access-urban-spaces">Outdoor Recreation Legacy Partnership</a> program. The program, established in 2014 and supported by the Land and Water Conservation Fund, enables urban communities to create new outdoor recreation spaces, reinvigorate existing parks, and form connections between people and the outdoors in economically underserved communities.</li></ul><ul><li>As the largest Federal provider of water-based outdoor recreation in America, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) is investing $120 million from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Disaster Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2022 to improve recreation facilities across the nation. These investments will promote equitable access to outdoor recreation opportunities and support local communities. USACE recreation areas had 268 million visits in the last fiscal year, resulting in spending that supports approximately 217,000 jobs and generates nearly $14.5 billion for local economies.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Expanded hunting and sport fishing opportunities on National Wildlife Refuge System lands and waters.</strong><ul><li>The U.S. Department of the Interior <a href="https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/interior-department-announces-largest-expansion-fishing-and-hunting-us-fish-and">expanded hunting and fishing access on 2.1 million acres of National Wildlife Refuge System</a> lands and waters in 2021, the largest expansion of outdoor recreation opportunities in recent history. The Department is continuing to explore opportunities to provide additional access to refuge system lands. Hunting, fishing, and other outdoor activities contributed more than $156 billion in economic activity in communities across the United States in 2016, according to the Service’s National Survey of Fishing, Hunting, and Wildlife-Associated Recreation, published every five years. More than 101 million Americans — 40 percent of the U.S. population age 16 and older — pursue wildlife-related recreation, including hunting and fishing.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Focused acquisitions and improvements of Federal lands and waters under the Great American Outdoors Act (GAOA) of 2020, which passed with overwhelming bipartisan support.</strong><ul><li>The U.S. Department of Agriculture <a href="https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2022/06/06/usda-announces-503-million-improve-outdoor-recreation-and">announced more than $503 million in funding</a> for National Forests and Grasslands. The funds will go to projects to address deferred maintenance and improve campgrounds, trails, and facilities on National Forests. Funds will also be spent on land acquisition to expand recreation opportunities for visitors and strengthen resource protection partnerships with State agencies and private organizations.</li></ul><ul><li>The Department of the Interior <a href="https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/department-interior-announces-279-million-support-public-parks-expand-outdoor">announced $279 million</a> to support Federal lands and waters and expand outdoor recreation access utilizing the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) to all 50 states, U.S. territories, and the District of Columbia for state-identified outdoor recreation and resource protection projects.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Expanded outdoor recreation opportunities by protecting areas for future generations.</strong><ul><li>In celebration of National Trails Day, Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland <a href="https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/secretary-haaland-promotes-outdoor-recreation-designates-ten-new-national-recreation">announced the designation of nine new National Recreation Trails</a> in seven states, adding nearly 600 miles to the National Trails System.</li></ul><ul><li>Secretary Deb Haaland <a href="https://www.fws.gov/press-release/2022-07/secretary-haaland-announces-lost-trail-conservation-area-montana">announced the establishment of the Lost Trail Conservation Area</a> in Northwest Montana as the 568th and newest unit of the National Wildlife Refuge System, managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. This expansion – the first new unit in the Refuge System for the Biden-Harris Administration – is the culmination of a 20-year, locally-led effort to conserve important big game corridors and recreational areas in the region. The Service worked in partnership with the Trust for Public Land and the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes (CSKT) to purchase the 38,052-acre conservation easement from its continuing owner, Southern Pine Plantations.</li></ul><ul><li>The Bureau of Land Management, the U.S Department of Agriculture&#8217;s Forest Service, and the five Tribes of the Bears Ears Commission <a href="https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/blm-forest-service-and-five-tribes-bears-ears-commission-commit-historic-co-management">formalized their partnership</a> for co-management of the Bears Ears National Monument. The Hopi Tribe, Navajo Nation, Ute Mountain Ute Tribe, Ute Indian Tribe of the Uintah and Ouray Reservation, and the Pueblo of Zuni will be joint managers of the National Monument and will receive resources from Federal agencies to participate in and take leadership on the management of their ancestral lands.</li></ul><ul><li>The USDA Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management <a href="https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2022/06/23/usda-forest-service-announces-plans-open-comments-rainy-river">are considering</a> a 20-year withdrawal of 225,000 acres of U.S. Forest System lands in Minnesota to protect the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness – the most visited wilderness area in the country. The Rainy River watershed flows north toward the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness and Voyageurs National Park, landscapes renowned for high-quality fishing, wildlife viewing, and recreational opportunities due to the large number of interconnected lakes and pristine water quality. The proposed mineral withdrawal aims to prevent further negative environmental impacts from future mining operations. It also evaluates the impacts of future mining on important social, cultural, and economic values.</li></ul><ul><li>On World Oceans Day, NOAA Administrator Rick Spinrad announced NOAA’s initiation of the designation process for a new national marine sanctuary <a href="https://sanctuaries.noaa.gov/hudson-canyon/">to conserve Hudson Canyon</a> in the Atlantic Ocean. A sanctuary designation would help conserve the area’s rich marine wildlife and habitats, and promote scientific research, ocean education, and recreation opportunities such as whale watching, recreational fishing, and boating.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Created workforce development opportunities with the establishment of an Indian Youth Service Corps Program.</strong><ul><li>The Biden-Harris Administration announced the launch of the <a href="https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/secretary-haaland-launches-new-indian-youth-service-corps-program">Indian Youth Service Corps Program</a>, which will provide meaningful education, employment, and training opportunities to Indigenous youth through conservation projects on Federal and Indian lands – thereby putting young people on a path to good-paying jobs while helping to address the climate crisis.</li></ul></li></ul>

<p>TO THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES:</p>



<p>Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, within 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President publishes in the <em>Federal Register</em> and transmits to the Congress a notice stating that the&nbsp;emergency is to continue in effect beyond the anniversary date. &nbsp;In accordance with this provision, I have sent to the <em>Federal Register</em> for publication the enclosed notice stating that the national emergency with respect to significant transnational criminal organizations that was declared in Executive Order&nbsp;13581 of July&nbsp;24, 2011, under which additional steps were&nbsp;taken in Executive Order 13863 of March 15, 2019, is&nbsp;to&nbsp;continue in effect beyond July 24, 2022.</p>



<p>The activities of significant transnational criminal organizations have&nbsp;reached such scope and gravity that they threaten the stability of international political and economic systems. &nbsp;Such&nbsp;organizations are becoming increasingly sophisticated and dangerous to the United States; they are increasingly entrenched in the operations of foreign governments and the international financial system, thereby weakening democratic institutions, degrading the rule of law, and undermining economic markets. &nbsp;These organizations facilitate and aggravate violent civil conflicts and increasingly facilitate the activities of other dangerous persons.</p>



<p>Significant transnational criminal organizations continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United&nbsp;States. &nbsp;Therefore, I&nbsp;have determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency with respect to&nbsp;significant transnational criminal organizations declared in&nbsp;Executive Order 13581.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-right">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.</p>

<p>On July 24, 2011, by Executive Order 13581, the President declared a national emergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 <em>et seq.</em>) to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States constituted by significant transnational criminal organizations.</p>



<p>On March 15, 2019, by Executive Order 13863, the President took additional steps to deal with the national emergency with respect to significant transnational criminal organizations in view of the evolution of these organizations as well as the increasing sophistication of their activities, which threaten international political and economic systems and pose a direct threat to the safety and welfare of the United States and its citizens, and given the ability of these organizations to derive revenue through widespread illegal conduct, including acts of violence and abuse that exhibit a wanton disregard for human life as well as many other crimes enriching and empowering these organizations.</p>



<p>Significant transnational criminal organizations continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.  For these reasons, the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13581 on July 24, 2011, under which additional steps were taken in Executive Order 13863 on March 15, 2019, must continue in effect beyond July 24, 2022.  Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency with respect to significant transnational criminal organizations declared in Executive Order 13581.</p>



<p>This notice shall be published in the <em>Federal&nbsp;Register </em>and transmitted to the Congress.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>President Biden knows what works to make our communities safer: investing in community policing and crime prevention. We need to fund police who walk the beat, know the neighborhood, are accountable to those they are sworn to serve, and build community trust and safety. We need to invest in mental health and substance use treatment services, crisis responders, and social workers to reduce the burden on police officers and prevent violent crime. We need to expand community violence interventions – led by trusted messengers breaking the cycle of violence and trauma. We need to enforce our commonsense gun laws, require background checks for all gun sales in order to keep firearms out of the hands of felons and domestic abusers, and ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines – weapons of war that have no place in our communities.<br><br>President Biden has taken action to make our communities safer during his first 18 months in office:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Funded the police and improved police accountability</strong>. Other politicians talk about funding the police, but President Biden and Congressional Democrats actually got it done by enacting the American Rescue Plan (ARP). <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/05/13/fact-sheet-president-biden-issues-call-for-state-and-local-leaders-to-dedicate-more-american-rescue-plan-funding-to-make-our-communities-safer-and-deploy-these-dollars-quickly/">Over $10 billion in ARP funds</a> have already been committed to policing and other public safety efforts – including at least $6.5 billion in State and Local funds committed in more than 300 communities across the country. Along with ongoing support from the Justice Department, ARP investments made 2021 among the largest single-year commitments of federal resources for state and local law enforcement and public safety on record. President Biden also signed a historic <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2022/05/25/executive-order-on-advancing-effective-accountable-policing-and-criminal-justice-practices-to-enhance-public-trust-and-public-safety/">executive order</a> to advance effective, accountable policing that will build public trust and strengthen public safety. Leading civil rights organizations and law enforcement organizations such as the International Association of Chiefs of Police and the Fraternal Order of Police support this order.<br></li><li><strong>Tackled gun violence</strong>. President Biden is implementing his comprehensive <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/23/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-comprehensive-strategy-to-prevent-and-respond-to-gun-crime-and-ensure-public-safety/">strategy</a> to reduce gun crime. The Biden Administration has taken <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/07/11/fact-sheet-the-biden-administrations-21-executive-actions-to-reduce-gun-violence/">more executive action</a> to reduce gun violence than any other president at this point in their Administration, including by reining in the proliferation of ghost guns and cracking down on gun traffickers and rogue gun dealers. The President was the first president in nearly 30 years to bring together Members of Congress from both parties to take action on gun violence, signing the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. The President also secured Senate confirmation of career prosecutor Steve Dettelbach to serve as Director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, empowering this law enforcement agency with its first confirmed leader since 2015.<br></li><li><strong>Investing in community-led crime prevention and intervention.</strong> States and cities across the country have used ARP funding to invest in public safety strategies such as summer jobs for young adults and substance use and mental health services. Through the bipartisan budget deal and the Bipartisan Safer communities Act, the President has secured $300 million to expand community violence interventions. The Biden Administration has also made changes to <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/07/fact-sheet-more-details-on-the-biden-harris-administrations-investments-in-community-violence-interventions/">26 different federal programs</a> to direct additional funding to evidence-based violence interventions. And, the Department of Labor is <a href="https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/eta/eta20220307">investing in job programs</a> to help formerly incarcerated individuals successfully reenter their communities.</li></ul>



<p>The President believes we can and must do more to reduce crime and save lives. Today, President Biden is building on this progress with his Safer America Plan<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/budget_fy2023.pdf">. President Biden’s fiscal year 2023 budget</a> requests a fully paid-for new investment of approximately $35 billion to support law enforcement and crime prevention – in addition to the President’s $2 billion discretionary request for these same programs. The plan he is releasing today outlines, for the first time, how this $37 billion will be used to save lives and make communities safer.<br><br>Specifically, the Safer America Plan:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Funds the police and promotes effective prosecution of crimes affecting families today.</strong> The Safer America Plan will provide communities the resources they need to keep our streets safe, including by helping them hire and train 100,000 additional police officers for accountable community policing (nearly $13 billion over the next five years through the COPS Hiring Program) and setting aside dedicated funds for small law enforcement agencies. At the same time, this plan will invest nearly $3 billion to help communities clear court backlogs and solve murders so we can take shooters and other violent criminals off the streets, including by helping communities set up task forces to share intelligence to bring down the gun violence rate. The plan also aims to crack down on other serious crimes affecting families today. The plan will impose tougher penalties for fentanyl trafficking. To tackle organized retail theft, the plan calls on Congress to pass legislation to require online marketplaces, like Amazon, to verify third-party sellers’ information, and to impose liability on online marketplaces for the sale of stolen goods on their platforms.<br></li><li><strong>Invests in crime prevention and a fairer criminal justice system. </strong>The Safer America Plan will invest in services that address the causes of crime and reduce the burdens on police so they can focus on violent crime, including mental health and substance use disorder services; crisis responders, violence interrupters, and social workers; and expanding access to job training, education, housing, and other supportive services that prevent crime and advance equity. The Plan establishes a new $15 billion grant program called Accelerating Justice System Reform that cities and states can use over the next 10 years to advance strategies that will: (1) prevent violent crime and/or (2) ease the burden on police officers by identifying non-violent situations that may merit a public health response or other response. It also invests an additional $5 billion in evidence-based community violence intervention programs. The plan proposes to end the crack-powder disparity, making the fix retroactive. The plan will help formerly incarcerated individuals successfully reenter society, including by lifting nearly all restrictions on eligibility and access to vital federal benefits and programs that people need to get back on their feet after leaving incarceration.<br></li><li><strong>Takes additional commonsense steps on guns</strong> <strong>to keep dangerous firearms out of dangerous hands. </strong>The President has already proposed to increase funding for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) by 13% so ATF can hire new agents and investigators to help cities trace firearms and analyze ballistics from crime scenes. The President will also continue to call on Congress to take additional actions on guns, including requiring background checks for all gun sales, banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, closing the dating violence restraining order loophole, and banning the manufacture, sale, or possession of unserialized “ghost guns.”</li></ul>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Vice President announces that since GetInternet.gov launch in May, Administration has signed up 1 million new households to save hundreds of dollars a year on internet service</em></p>



<p>Access to high-speed internet is no longer a luxury. Still, too many families go without high-speed internet because of the cost or have to cut back on other essentials to make their monthly internet service payments.  That’s why President Biden and Vice President Harris worked with Democrats, Republicans, and Independents to include the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP) in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which <a href="https://www.internetforall.gov/">provides $65 billion</a> to provide Internet for All — to ensure that every American has access to reliable and affordable high-speed internet.  <br><br>The ACP, administered by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), provides eligible households up to $30/month (or $75/month on Tribal lands) off internet bills, as well as a one-time $100 discount off a connected device. To further lower costs, in May, President Biden and Vice President Harris announced commitments from internet service providers across the country to offer high-speed plans that are fully covered by the ACP—meaning millions of working families can now get high-speed internet without paying a dime. They simultaneously launched <a href="https://getinternet.gov/">GetInternet.gov</a>—a one-stop shop to check eligibility and sign up.<br><br>Today in North Carolina, Vice President Harris is announcing that, <strong>thanks to the Administration’s “all of government” enrollment drive,1 million new households have signed up to save on home broadband through the ACP.</strong><br>The Administration’s efforts increased the rate of ACP enrollments by about 35%.<br><br>To build on this success, today the Vice President called on the nation’s governors to join the Administration’s enrollment drive, sending them letters describing key steps they can take to boost enrollment in their states. For example, today, the State of North Carolina committed to email 5 million households to let them know they can lower their internet bill by visiting GetInternet.gov to check eligibility and sign up.<br><br><br><strong><u>THE BIDEN-HARRIS ADMINISTRATION’S “ALL OF GOVERNMENT” ENROLLMENT DRIVE</u></strong><br><br><strong><em>Partnering with state and local governments</em></strong>: The Vice President’s call to action today builds on the Administration’s existing successful partnerships with state and local governments to spread the word. For example:</p>



<ul><li>Michigan texted about 1.3 million likely eligible Michiganders and gained 25,000 new ACP enrollees as a result.</li><li>Albemarle County, Virginia now includes a “P.S.” about GetInternet.gov in every client communication by county social service workers.</li><li>Massachusetts recently texted more than 1 million Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) beneficiaries about GetInternet.gov and saw their rate of enrollments double in the five days following the text.</li><li>The City of Mesa, Arizona reports that constituents who hear about ACP are extremely interested. Mesa’s texts to residents about GetInternet.gov have a 10% clickthrough rate, as compared to a usual 1-5% rate for other Mesa governmental outreach.</li><li>New York City sent backpack flyers about ACP home via 1,700 principals to reach about 1 million children who attend Free and Reduced-Price School Lunch Community-Eligible Schools, and it will advertise GetInternet.gov at bus stops in zip codes with a high number of households likely eligible for ACP.</li></ul>



<p><strong><em>Leveraging all of the federal government</em></strong>: In addition to working with state and local partners, the Administration is using every tool in its toolbox to get the word out—including communicating directly with households that are automatically eligible for ACP due to their participation in other federal government programs. For example:</p>



<ul><li>The Social Security Administration (SSA) emailed all 1.7 million Supplemental Security Income recipients who have a “my social security” account letting them know that they are eligible for ACP. SSA plans to send a second email to recipients this summer. The agency is also running PSAs on Social Security Television, broadcast in more than 1,200 local social security offices nationwide.</li><li>This summer, the Department of Education will email over 6 million Pell grant recipients who are eligible for ACP. It will also conduct a Back-To-School campaign with information about ACP.</li><li>The Department of Veterans Affairs sent information to its 12 million VetResources email subscribers and 120 Community Veteran Engagement Boards, as Veterans Pension and Survivors Benefit recipients are eligible for ACP. This summer the Veterans Benefits Administration will also directly mail all 380,000 Veterans and Survivors currently receiving pension benefits a notification letter and flyer.</li><li>The Department of Housing and Urban Development emailed over 3,000 Public Housing Authorities with information about the ACP to share with their over 3 million families who receive Federal Public Housing Assistance and are eligible, and is currently doing follow-up engagement.</li><li>The Department of the Interior’s Bureau of Trust Funds Administration reached out to over 400,000 beneficiaries with a direct mailing to let them know about ACP. The Department also trained over 200 call center and field staff who work at the Bureau of Trust Funds Administration to disseminate information and answer questions about eligibility and how to enroll in ACP.</li><li>Broadband infrastructure grant programs operated by the Department of the Treasury, the Department of Agriculture, and the Department of Commerce are all requiring grant funding recipients to participate in the ACP, helping ensuring federal funds are used to deploy networks that are actually affordable.</li></ul>



<p><strong><em>Working with advocates and digital navigators</em></strong>: The Administration is also working with trusted community leaders to get the word out and enroll eligible households. For example:</p>



<ul><li>The FCC has registered over 40,000 individuals and organizations to be ACP outreach partners. To build on these efforts, the FCC is in the process of standing up a new grant program to empower partners to engage their communities and has reserved up to $100 million of Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding to conduct ACP outreach efforts, including consumer research, focus groups, paid media campaigns, and grants to outreach partners over the next five years.</li><li>The Administration partnered with civil rights groups to kick off a Week of Action in June, in which the Leadership Conference and partner civil rights organizations reached out to communities to encourage households to sign up for ACP.</li><li>Thanks to Administration outreach, United Way will share information about ACP in communications reaching at least 15,000 people per month.</li><li>The Administration also worked with Propel, a financial technology platform used by SNAP beneficiaries that reaches over 5 million low-income households. Propel is running an ACP promotion campaign through July.</li></ul>



<p><strong><u>THE AFFORDABLE CONNECTIVITY PROGRAM (ACP)</u></strong></p>



<p>The ACP is a key part of the Administration’s <a href="https://www.internetforall.gov/">Internet for All</a> initiative and the largest internet affordability program in our nation’s history. Experts estimate that&nbsp;<a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/610831a16c95260dbd68934a/t/62785ccb671629771cd1a60d/1652055243247/Broadband-Connectivity-Fact-Sheet-CPSP-2022.pdf">48 million households</a>—or nearly 40% of households in the country—qualify for the ACP either because their income is at or below 200% of the Federal Poverty Level, or because a member of the household meets one of the other criteria below:</p>



<ul><li>Participates in one of the following programs:<ul><li>Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), formerly known as Food Stamps</li><li>Medicaid</li><li>Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC)</li><li>Supplemental Security Income (SSI)</li><li>Federal Public Housing Assistance (FPHA)</li><li>Veterans Pension and Survivors Benefit</li><li>Free and Reduced-Price School Lunch Program or School Breakfast Program, including at U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Community Eligibility Provision schools</li><li>Federal Pell Grant (received in the current award year)</li><li>Lifeline</li><li>Certain Tribal assistance programs, including Bureau of Indian Affairs General Assistance, Head Start (only households meeting the income qualifying standard), Tribal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (Tribal TANF), and Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations</li></ul></li><li>Meets the eligibility criteria for a participating broadband provider’s existing low-income internet program.</li></ul>



<p>As of now, more than 1,300 internet service providers participate in the program, and about 13 million households have signed up to receive the ACP benefit.<br><br>Households can check their eligibility for ACP, sign up, and find fully covered plans by visiting <a href="https://getinternet.gov/">GetInternet.gov</a>. They can also learn more by calling (877) 384-2575.<br><br>The ACP enrollment drive is just one part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s <a href="https://www.internetforall.gov/">Internet for All Initiative</a> to ensure that every American has access to reliable and affordable high-speed internet. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provides a $65 billion investment in high-speed internet access—on top of <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/06/07/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-over-25-billion-in-american-rescue-plan-funding-to-help-ensure-every-american-has-access-to-high-speed-affordable-internet/">billions</a> in funding for high-speed, affordable internet provided by the American Rescue Plan that is currently being deployed across the nation.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Joint Base Andrews<br>Prince George’s County, Maryland</p>



<p>5:19 P.M. EDT</p>



<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Thanks for coming up.&nbsp; That’s going to be a cool plant.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. President, you talked a lot about climate being an emergency today.&nbsp; Why not just declare it an emergency?</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Because I’m running <s>into</s> [the]* traps on the totality of the authority I have.&nbsp; I will make that decision soon.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And what would be the ramifications of doing it?&nbsp; Do you think you&#8217;d be able to do more?</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Well, I think I can do more, unless the Congress acts.&nbsp; In the meantime, I can do more, because not enough is being done now.&nbsp; And so, there&#8217;s still discussions going on about whether or not there will be some action on my climate plan.&nbsp; And that’s &#8212; I&#8217;m told that&#8217;s in play.&nbsp; And we&#8217;ll see.&nbsp; We&#8217;ll see what happens.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you still have hopes for a legislative agreement with Senator Manchin on climate?</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; I&#8217;ve not spoken to Senator Manchin.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, no?&nbsp; No hopes for one?</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; I do not have an agreement with Senator Manchin.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. President, do you think it&#8217;s a good idea for Speaker Pelosi to travel to Taiwan this summer?&nbsp;</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Well, I &#8212; I think that &#8212; the military thinks it’s not a good idea right now, but I don&#8217;t know what the status of it is.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And what about declaring a public health emergency for abortion, sir?&nbsp; Where does that stand?</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Well, that&#8217;s in consideration as well.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still?&nbsp; That’s still under consideration?&nbsp;</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Okay &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, are you pleased with your administration&#8217;s response to monkeypox?&nbsp; Senator Patty Murray today expressed concern to the HHS.</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Well, I’ve &#8212; I think we should be doing all that we possibly can.&nbsp; And I&#8217;m getting a report on that on Friday.</p>



<p>Okay?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you expect to talk to President Xi soon, sir?&nbsp;</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; I think I&#8217;ll be talking to President Xi within the next 10 days.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What&#8217;s your take on the next steps for COVID, Mr. President?&nbsp; Cases are going up.&nbsp; What should the country be doing right now?</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Getting vaccinated.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And for those who aren&#8217;t?</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; They’ve got a problem.&nbsp; It’s not &#8212; it’s not in their interest or the public’s interest not to get vaccinated.&nbsp; We have the capacity to control it.&nbsp; They should get vaccinated now.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And you said you’re going to speak to President Xi in the next 10 days.</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; I didn’t say that.&nbsp; I said I expect to.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Expect to.&nbsp; What will you tell him about tariffs?&nbsp;</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; I&#8217;ll tell him to have a good day.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; (Laughs.)</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Laughs.)&nbsp; What about the student loan decision, sir?&nbsp; People have said that you&#8217;re going to make that decision by the end of August.&nbsp; Where does that stand at this point?</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; By the end of August.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thank you so much.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Brayton Point Power Station<br>Somerset, Massachusetts</p>



<p>2:43 P.M. EDT</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.&nbsp; And thank you for your patience.&nbsp; You’ve been sitting out here.&nbsp; Appreciate &#8212; please, have a seat, if you have one.</p>



<p>Well, hello, Massachusetts.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; It’s an honor to be with your outstanding members of Congress today: Senator Ed Markey.&nbsp; Ed?&nbsp; Where’s &#8212; there you go.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Senator Elizabeth Warren.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Congressman Auchincloss &#8212; -oss.&nbsp; Where is she?&nbsp; There you go, Jake.&nbsp; Bill Keating &#8212; Congressman.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>And your great former members and one of my dearest friends, John Kerry, who’s doing a great job leading our international &#8212; (applause) &#8212; Special Presidential Envoy on Climate, traveling the world and talking with an awful lot of people he’s talking into moving more than they’ve been doing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And another great Massachusetts nata- &#8212; native, Gina McCarthy.&nbsp; Gina?&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; There she is.&nbsp; My National Climate Advisor is leading our climate efforts here at home.</p>



<p>It’s an honor to be joined by your neighbor by &#8212; your neighbor from Rhode Island.&nbsp; He’s not a bad guy at all.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; I live in his house.&nbsp; Sheldon Whitehouse &#8212; a great champion &#8212; (applause) &#8212; a great champion of the environment.&nbsp; And he’d been banging away at it.</p>



<p>I come here today with a message: As President, I have a responsibility to act with urgency and resolve when our nation faces clear and present danger.&nbsp; And that’s what climate change is about.&nbsp; It is literally, not figuratively, a clear and present danger.</p>



<p>The health of our citizens and our communities is literally at stake.</p>



<p>The U.N.’s leading international climate scientists called the latest climate report nothing less than, quote, “code red for humanity.”&nbsp; Let me say it again: “Code red for humanity.”&nbsp; It’s not a group of political official &#8212; elected officials.&nbsp; These are the scientists.</p>



<p>We see here in America, in red states and blue states, extreme weather events costing $145 billion &#8212; $145 billion in damages just last year &#8212; more powerful and destructive hurricanes and tornadoes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I’ve flown over the vast majority of them out west and down in Louisiana, all across America.&nbsp; It’s a &#8212; it’s amazing to see.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ravaging hundred-year-old droughts occurring every few years instead of every hundred years.&nbsp; Wildfires out west that have burned and destroyed more than 5 million acres &#8212; everything in its path.&nbsp; That is more land than the entire state of New Jersey, from New York down to the tip of Delaware.&nbsp; It’s amazing.&nbsp; Five million acres.</p>



<p>Our national security is at stake as well.&nbsp; Extreme weather is already damaging our military installations here in the States.&nbsp; And our economy is at risk.&nbsp; So we have to act.</p>



<p>Extreme weather disrupts supply chains, causing delays and shortages for consumers and businesses.</p>



<p>Climate change is literally an existential threat to our nation and to the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So my message today is this: Since Congress is not acting as it should &#8212; and these guys here are, but we’re not getting many Republican votes &#8212; this is an emergency. &nbsp;An emergency.&nbsp; And I will &#8212; I will look at it that way.</p>



<p>I said last week and I’ll say it again loud and clear: As President, I’ll use my executive powers to combat climate &#8212; the climate crisis in the absence of congressional actions, notwithstanding their incredible action.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the coming days, my administration will announce the executive actions we have developed to combat this emergency. &nbsp;We need to act.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But just take a look around: Right now, 100 million Americans are under heat alert &#8212; 100 million Americans.&nbsp; Ninety communities across America set records for high temperatures just this year, including here in New England as we speak.</p>



<p>And, by the way, records have been set in the Arctic and the Antarctic, with temperatures that are just unbelievable, melting the permafrost. &nbsp;And it’s astounding the damage that’s being done.</p>



<p>And this crisis impacts every aspect of our everyday life.&nbsp; That’s why today I’m making the largest investment ever &#8212; $2.3 billion &#8212; to help communities across the country build infrastructure that is designed to withstand the full range of disasters we’ve been seeing up to today -– extreme heat, drought, flooding, hurricanes, tornadoes.</p>



<p>Right now, there are millions of people suffering from extreme heat at home.&nbsp; So my team is also working with the states to deploy $385 million right now.</p>



<p>For the first time, states will be able to use federal funds to pay for air conditioners in homes, set up community cooling centers in schools where people can get through these extreme heat crises.&nbsp; And I mean people &#8212; and crises that are 100 to 117 degrees.</p>



<p>An Infrastructure Law that your members of Congress have delivered includes $3.1 billion to weatherize homes and make them more energy efficient, which will lower energy cost while keeping America cool in the summer and warm in the winter, and not using too much energy.</p>



<p>And my Department of Labor, led by a guy named <em>Marty Walsh &#8212;</em> (said in Boston accent) &#8212; he talks funny, but he’s a hell of a guy.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; But all kidding aside, Marty was a great mayor, and I know &#8212; I know he knows how to get a job done.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And he’s doing two things for me:</p>



<p>First of all, as Secretary of Labor, he’s developing the first-ever workplace standards for extreme heat, saying, under these cond- &#8212; under these conditions, if it hits this pr- &#8212; you cannot do the following &#8212; you cannot ask people to do a certain thing.</p>



<p>Second, he’s sending folks out from the Labor Department to make sure we hold workplaces and &#8212; to those standards that are being set.&nbsp; They’ve already completed over 500 heat-related inspections of workplaces across 43 states.&nbsp; At the end of the day, it’s going to save lives.</p>



<p>Now, let me tell you why we’re here at Brayton Point.&nbsp; Five years ago, this towering power plant that once stood with cooling towers 500 feet high closed down.&nbsp; The coal plant at Brayton Point was the largest of its kind in New England &#8212; 1,500 megawatts of power, enough to power one in five Massachusetts homes and businesses.</p>



<p>For over 50 years, this plant supported this region’s economy through their electrici- &#8212; the electricity they supplied, the good jobs they provided, and the local taxes they paid.</p>



<p>But the plant, like many others around the country, had another legacy: one of toxins, smog, greenhouse gas emissions, the kind of pollution that contributed to the climate emergency we now face today.</p>



<p>Gina McCarthy, a former regulator in Massachusetts, was telling me on the way up how folks used to get a rag out and wipe the gunk off of their car’s windshields in the morning just to be able to drive &#8212; not very much unlike where I grew up in a place called Claymont, Delaware &#8212; which has more oil refineries than Houston, Texas, had in its region &#8212; just across the line in Pennsylvania.  And all the prevailing winds were our way.<br><br>I just lived up the road.  I just &#8212; in an apartment complex when we moved to Delaware.  And just up the road was a little school I went to, Holy Rosary grade school.  And because it was a four-lane highway that was accessible, my mother drove us and &#8212; rather than us be able to walk.<br><br>And guess what?  The first frost, you knew what was happening.  You had to put on your windshield wipers to get, literally, the oil slick off the window.  That’s why I and so damn many other people I grew up [with] have cancer and why can- &#8212; for the longest time, Delaware had the highest cancer rate in the nation.</p>



<p>But that’s the past, and we’re going to get &#8212; we’re going to build a different future with one &#8212; one with clean energy, good-paying jobs.</p>



<p>Just 15 years ago, America generated more than half its electricity from coal &#8212; coal-fired plants.&nbsp; Today, that’s down to 20 percent because there’s a big transition happening.</p>



<p>Many of these fossil fuel plants are becoming sites for new clean energy construction.&nbsp; Others are switching to new, clean technologies.</p>



<p>Look at Brayton Point.&nbsp; Today, Brayton is one of the frontiers &#8212; on the frontier of clean energy in America.&nbsp; On this site, they’ll manufacture four hun- &#8212; 248 miles of high-tech, heavy-duty cables.&nbsp; Those specialized, subsea cables are necessary to tie offshore wind farms to the existing grid.</p>



<p>Manufacturing these cables will mean good-paying jobs for 250 workers &#8212; as many workers as the old plant &#8212; power plant had at its peak.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And the port &#8212; (applause) &#8212; the port here, 34 feet deep, was used to carry coal into the power plant.&nbsp; Now we’re going to use that same port to carry components of &#8212; for wind power into the sea.</p>



<p>The converter station here and the substation nearby are the assets that move energy across the power lines.</p>



<p>They’ll now move clean electricity generated offshore by the wind &#8212; (applause) &#8212; enough power to power hundreds of thousands of homes onto the grid &#8212; putting old assets to work delivering clean energy. &nbsp;This didn’t happen by accident.&nbsp; It happened because we believed and invested in America’s innovation and ingenuity.</p>



<p>One of the companies investing in the factory here joined me at the White House this month.&nbsp; Vineyard Winds, whose CEO told me about the ground-breaking project labor agreements they’ve negotiated, would create good-paying union jobs.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>And I want to compliment Congressman Bill Keating for his work in this area.</p>



<p>I’m also proud to point out that my administration approved the first commercial project for offshore wind in America, which is being constructed by Vineyard Winds.</p>



<p>Folks, elsewhere in the country, we are pr- &#8212; we are propelling retrofits and ensuring that even where fossil fuel plant retires, they still have a role in powering the future.</p>



<p>In Illinois, for example, the state has launched a broad effort to invest in converting old power plants to solar farms, led by Governor Pritzker.</p>



<p>In California, the IBEW members have helped turn a former oil plant into the world’s largest battery storage facility &#8212; the world’s largest facility.</p>



<p>In Wyoming, innovators are chosen to &#8212; a retiring plant as the next site for the next-generation nuclear plant.</p>



<p>And my administr- &#8212; my administration is a partner in that progress, driving federal resources and funding to the communities that have powered this country for generations.&nbsp; And that’s why they need to be taken care of as well.</p>



<p>I want to thank Cecil Roberts, a friend and President of United Mine Workers of America, and so many other labor leaders who worked with &#8212; worked with on these initiatives.</p>



<p>Since I took office, we’ve invested more than $4 billion in federal funding to the 25 hardest-hit coal communities in the country, from West Virginia, to Kentucky, to Wyoming, to New Mexico.</p>



<p>Through the Infrastructure Law, we’re investing in clean hydrogen, nuclear, and carbon capture with the largest grid investment in American history.</p>



<p>We’ve secured $16 billion to clean up abandoned mines and wells, protecting thousands of communities from toxins and waste, particularly methane.  And we still &#8212; and we’re going to seal leaking methane pollution &#8212; an incredibly power[ful] greenhouse gas that’s 40 times more dangerous to the environment than carbon dioxide.  (Applause.)</p>



<p>And, folks, with American leadership back on climate, I was able to bring more world leaders together than &#8212; we got 100 nations together to agree that &#8212; at the major conference in Glasgow, England &#8212; I mean, Scotland &#8212; to change the emissions policies we had.</p>



<p>We’ve made real progress, but there is an enormous task ahead.&nbsp; We have to keep retaining and recruiting building trades and union electricians for jobs in wind, solar, hydrogen, nuclear, creating even more and better jobs.</p>



<p>We have to revitalize communities, especially those fence-line communities that are smothered by the legacy of pollution.</p>



<p>We have to outcompete China and in the world, and make these technologies here in the United States &#8212; not have to import them.</p>



<p>Folks, when I think about climate change &#8212; and I’ve been saying this for three years &#8212; I think jobs.&nbsp; Climate change, I think jobs.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>Almost 100 wind turbines going up off the coasts of Massachusetts and Rhode Island with ground broken and work underway.</p>



<p>Jobs manufacturing 2,500-ton steel foundations that anchor these offshore wind farms to the sea’s floor. &nbsp;Jobs manufacturing a Jones Act vessel in Texas to service these offshore wind farms.</p>



<p>We’re going to make sure that the ocean is open for the clean energy of our future, and everything we can do &#8212; give a green light to wind power on the Atlantic coast, where my predecessor’s actions only created confusion.</p>



<p>And today we begin the process to develop wind power in the Gulf of Mexico as well for the first time.&nbsp; A real opportunity to power millions of additional homes from wind.</p>



<p>Let’s clear the way &#8212; let’s clear the way for clean energy and connect these projects to the grid.</p>



<p>I’ve directed my administration to clear every federal hurdle and streamline federal permitting that brings these clean energy projects online right now and right away.&nbsp; And some of you have already come up and talked to me about that.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>And while so many governors and mayors have been strong partners in this fight to tackle climate change, we need all governors and mayors.&nbsp; We need public utility commissioners and state agency heads.&nbsp; We need electric utilities and developers to stand up and be part of the solution.&nbsp; Don’t be a road block.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>You all have a duty right now to our economy, to our competitiveness in the world, to the young people in this nation, and to future generations &#8212; and that sounds like hyperbole but it’s not; it’s real &#8212; to act boldly on climate.</p>



<p>And so does Congress, which &#8212; notwithstanding the leadership of the men and women that are here today &#8212; has failed in this duty.&nbsp; Not a single Republican in Congress stepped up to support my climate plan.&nbsp; Not one.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, let me be clear: Climate change is an emergency.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And in the coming weeks, I’m going to use the power I have as President to turn these words into formal, official government actions through the appropriate proclamations, executive orders, and regulatory power that a President possesses.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>And when it comes to fighting the climate change &#8212; climate change, I will not take no for an answer.&nbsp; I will do everything in my power to clean our air and water, protect our people’s health, to win the clean energy future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This, again, sounds like hyperbole, but our children and grandchildren are counting on us.&nbsp; Not a joke.&nbsp; Not a joke.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>If we don&#8217;t keep it below 1.5 degrees Centigrade, we lose it all.&nbsp; We don&#8217;t get to turn it around.&nbsp; And the world is counting on us.&nbsp; And this is the United States of America.&nbsp; When we put our hearts and minds to it, there&#8217;s not a single thing beyond our capacity &#8212; I mean it &#8212; when we act together.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And of all things we should be acting together on, it’s climate. &nbsp;It’s climate.</p>



<p>And, by the way, my dear mother &#8212; God rest her soul &#8212; used to say, “Joey, out of everything bad, something good will come if you look hard enough.”&nbsp; Look what&#8217;s happening.&nbsp; We&#8217;re going to be able to create as many or more good-paying jobs.&nbsp; We&#8217;re going to make environments where people live safer.&nbsp; We&#8217;re going to make the clean &#8212; the air safer.&nbsp; I really mean it.&nbsp; We have an opportunity here.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I’ll bet you when you see what&#8217;s happened here in this cable construction here &#8212; manufacturing &#8212; and you go back and ask all the people who grew up in this beautiful place what they’d rather have: Do they want the plant back with everything it had, or what you&#8217;re going to have?&nbsp; I will be dumbfounded if you find anybody, other than for pure sentimental reasons, saying, “I&#8217;d rather have the coal plant.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>I&#8217;ll end by telling you another quick story.&nbsp; When we moved from Scranton &#8212; when coal died in Scranton, everything died in Scranton.&nbsp; And my dad wasn&#8217;t a coal miner.&nbsp; My &#8212; my great &#8212; my great-grandfather was a mining engineer.&nbsp; But my dad was in sales, and there was no work.&nbsp; So we left to go down to Delaware, where I told you where those oil plants were.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But I remember driving home &#8212; when you take the trolley in Scranton, going out North Washington and Adams Avenues. &nbsp;Within 15 blocks &#8212; we didn&#8217;t live in the neighborhood &#8212; among the most prestigious neighborhood in the region, in the &#8212; in the town where the Scrantons and other good, decent people lived, there was a pla- &#8212; you&#8217;d go by a wall that &#8212; my recollection is it was somewhere between 15 and 18 feet tall.&nbsp; And it went for the &#8212; essentially, a city block.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And you could see the coal piled up to the very top of the wall from inside.&nbsp; It was a coal-fired plant.&nbsp; A coal-fired plant.&nbsp; And all of that &#8212; all of the negative impacts of breathing that coal, the dust were effecting everybody.&nbsp; But at the time, people didn&#8217;t know it and there wasn&#8217;t any alternative.</p>



<p>Folks, we have no excuse now.&nbsp; We know it.&nbsp; There are answers for it.&nbsp; We can make things better in terms of jobs.&nbsp; We can make things better in terms of the environment.&nbsp; We can make things better for families overall.&nbsp; So I&#8217;m looking forward to this movement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thank you, thank you, thank you.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; May God bless you all.&nbsp; And may God protect our troops.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>
