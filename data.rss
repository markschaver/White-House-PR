<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>South Court Auditorium</em></p>



<p>3:01 P.M. EST<br><br>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Good afternoon, everyone.&nbsp; Good afternoon.&nbsp;<br><br>Jen Klein, thank you for the introduction and mostly for the work that you do every day, tirelessly, as the Director of our Gender Policy Council.<br><br>And to the members of Congress, members of our administration, business leaders, community leaders, and equal pay advocates who are here with us virtually and in person, thank you for your leadership, for your partnership, and for your commitment to action every day.<br><br>So, I&#8217;ll begin with a simple truth: Our economy just has not been working as it should for the women of our nation.&nbsp; Across industries, women are less likely to be hired than equally qualified men.&nbsp; They are paid less and promoted slower for doing similar work.&nbsp; Women are routinely shut out of good jobs in high-paying industries &#8212; such as science and technology, construction, and truck driving &#8212; in part because our society tells women that some industries are just not for them.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;And as study after study has shown, women are expected to shoulder an unequal share of unpaid caregiving responsibilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When families cannot afford or cannot find caregiving &#8212; such as childcare, eldercare, or home care &#8212; it often falls on women to fill the gaps, whether that means going part-time or leaving the workforce entirely or working full time at a paid job and full time performing unpaid caregiving.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>And over the past two years, the pandemic has only deepened these inequities as caregiving has become more expensive and more difficult to find.<br><br>And here&#8217;s how that all adds up: Today, on average, working women who are working full time, year-round, make just 83 cents for every dollar that a man makes.&nbsp;<br><br>And for many women of color, the gap is even wider.&nbsp; Over a 40-year career, a woman will lose out on about $400,000.&nbsp; For Black women, Latina women, Native American women, that loss in wages is closer to $1 million.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>And of course, that is money that a woman could use to pay off her student loan debt or put a down payment on a house or pay a mortgage or invest in a small business or save for retirement.&nbsp;<br><br>As one must recognize, lower wages mean working women have less money &#8212; less money to save today.&nbsp;&nbsp; And lower wages mean they receive lower Social Security benefits in their senior years.<br><br>For so many women, the gender wage gap acts as a virtual tax, making it so much more difficult to pay the bills and invest in their future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It can also have a negative impact on their productivity, job satisfaction, and retention.&nbsp;&nbsp; And by extension, it can have a negative impact on individual businesses and on our economy as a whole.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>As the business leaders here today will tell us, closing the gender wage gap &#8212; well, it&#8217;s not just a moral issue, it&#8217;s also a business one.<br><br>If we are going to continue to grow our economy and to be competitive and lead the world in the 21st century, we simply cannot afford to leave half of our workforce behind.&nbsp; To build an economy that works for all of us, we must build an economy that works for women.&nbsp;<br><br>That is one of our administration’s central missions.&nbsp;&nbsp; And that has been a central mission of mine for quite some time.&nbsp; In fact, when I served in the United States Senate, I introduced what we named the Domestic Workers Bill of Rights Act to ensure that domestic workers &#8212; 90 percent of whom are women &#8212; that they are paid fairly and that their rights are protected.<br><br>And, with Senator Patty Murray of Washington and Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro, I co-sponsored the Paycheck Fairness Act to make it easier for employees to bring equal pay claims against their employers.<br><br>And over the past year, our administration has taken important action to address the gender wage gap.&nbsp; We passed the American Rescue Plan, which provided immediate relief to millions of women who were severely impacted by the pandemic.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>We passed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which is creating good-paying, good union jobs, including for many women in industries where they are underrepresented, such as transportation, clean energy, and construction.<br><br>Today, we are taking additional steps to help increase pay equity across our nation.&nbsp;<br><br>One factor that contributes to pay inequity is the common practice of requiring job applicants to share their salary history.<br><br>Now, think about that.&nbsp; Why does that matter?&nbsp; Well, in effect, it&#8217;s allowing how much an employee was been paid in the past to impact how much they will be paid in the future.<br><br>So, think about that.&nbsp; For many women, this practice can mean that inequitable pay from a previous job will follow them to the current job, and so on, and so on.<br><br>So, our administration is committed to eliminating discriminatory pay practices that inhibit the economy, efficiency, and effectiveness of the federal government.&nbsp;<br><br>And that&#8217;s why today, our Office of Personnel Management will begin work to address the use of salary history in the hiring and pay-setting process for federal employees.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>And today, the President, Joe Biden, will sign an executive order that directs the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council to consider limiting the use of salary history in employment decisions by federal contractors.&nbsp;<br><br>In addition, today, our Department of Labor will direct federal contractors to strengthen pay audits.&nbsp; Pay audits help organizations determine whether they are paying all their employees equitably and, if they are not, give them data to help correct that inequity.&nbsp;<br><br>The President and I firmly believe that all companies should conduct these audits and, where appropriate, should be transparent about the results.&nbsp; By the way, I think it&#8217;s always appropriate to be transparent about the results.&nbsp; Because pay transparency creates accountability.&nbsp;&nbsp; And accountability &#8212; well, that drives progress.<br><br>Our administration cannot bridge the wage gap alone.&nbsp;&nbsp; It will truly take all of us, working together.&nbsp;<br><br>And&nbsp;that is why we are gathered here today at this summit.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We can build a more fair, more efficient, and more equitable economy &#8212; as I said and truly believe, an economy that works for women and for everyone.&nbsp; That&#8217;s how it goes: An economy that works for women works for everyone.<br><br>And so, together, we will continue to do this good work.&nbsp; I thank you all &#8212; all the leaders who are here.&nbsp; And let us continue with this important work until we truly reach a place where all workers and all people are treated fairly.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; END&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3:09 P.M.

<p>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Section 1.  Policy. </span> It is the policy of my Administration to eliminate discriminatory pay practices that inhibit the economy, efficiency, and effectiveness of the Federal workforce and the procurement of property and services by the Federal Government.  The Office of Personnel Management anticipates issuing a proposed rule that will address the use of salary history in the hiring and pay-setting processes for Federal employees, consistent with Executive Order 14035 of June 25, 2021 (Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility in the Federal Workforce).  The purpose of this order is to direct the consideration of parallel efforts with respect to Federal procurement.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 2.  Economy, Efficiency, and Effectiveness in Federal Procurement.  </span>Consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations, the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council, in consultation with the Secretary of Labor and the heads of other executive departments and agencies as appropriate, shall consider issuing proposed rules to promote economy, efficiency, and effectiveness in Federal procurement by enhancing pay equity and transparency for job applicants and employees of Federal contractors and subcontractors.  In doing so, the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council shall specifically consider whether any such rules should limit or prohibit Federal contractors and subcontractors from seeking and considering information about job applicants&#8217; and employees&#8217; existing or past compensation when making employment decisions.  The Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council shall also consider the inclusion of appropriate accountability measures in any such rules.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 3.  General Provisions.  </span>(a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:</p>



<p>(i)&nbsp;&nbsp; the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or</p>



<p>(ii)&nbsp; the functions of the Director of the Office of&nbsp;Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.</p>



<p>(b)&nbsp; This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.</p>



<p>(c)&nbsp; This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.</p>

<p>Today, Director of the National Economic Council Brian Deese and Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg met with key stakeholders in the country’s goods movement supply chain to launch a new initiative that will help to speed up the movement of goods, reducing delays and costs for American consumers. &nbsp;</p>



<p>NEC and DOT leaders discussed with port directors and business leaders the value of the new initiative. Freight Logistics Optimization Works (FLOW), an information sharing initiative to pilot key freight information exchange between parts of the supply chain. This commitment to moving the transportation logistics system to 21<sup>st</sup> century digitization follows the commitment to move toward 24/7 operations many made last fall.</p>



<p>Participants discussed the progress made to date in working collaboratively across private sector stakeholders and with federal and state governments to address supply chain bottlenecks at ports including the decline in long-term dwelling containers (by 60% at the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach since November), a reduction in empty containers (by more than 30% at the Port of Los Angeles since the beginning of the year), and the creation of pop-up sites for containers around the Port of Savannah. In particular, participants discussed the success of pop-up sites at restoring fluidity over the past year and how they will be needed in the future.</p>



<p>They underscored the value of greater data transparency across the supply chain and how this would benefit not only their respective companies but also the system more broadly, cutting waste and reducing costs for consumers. Participants acknowledged the current system is underperforming and needs greater investment and more collaboration in creating ship to shelf visibility into the primarily private-sector owned supply chain. A more reliable, predictable, and accurate information exchange about goods movement is the hallmark of a globally competitive 21<sup>st</sup> century goods movement chain and is especially important for small- and medium-sized businesses who lack visibility into the current system. Participants highlighted that this type of digital infrastructure was more important than ever in the face of supply chain disruptions caused by global events like the pandemic and Russia’s unprovoked aggression in Ukraine.</p>



<p><strong>Here’s what industry leaders across the supply chain are saying about this critical initiative: </strong><a href="https://www.transportation.gov/briefing-room/industry-leaders-endorse-biden-harris-administration-initiative-improve-supply-0">https://www.transportation.gov/briefing-room/industry-leaders-endorse-biden-harris-administration-initiative-improve-supply-0</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>After serving as the second-in-command at Treasury and with prior service on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, Sarah Bloom Raskin knows better than anyone how important the Federal Reserve is to fighting inflation and continuing a sustainable economic recovery. She has unparalleled experience pursuing solutions to enhance our country’s critical financial infrastructure, with expertise in cybersecurity and climate risk, and protecting consumers in the financial marketplace.</p>



<p>Sarah’s nomination had broad support—from the banking and financial services community, former members of the Board of Governors, multiple Nobel Prize winners, consumer advocates, and respected economists from around the country. That experience and support are among the many reasons why I nominated Sarah to be the Vice Chair for Supervision, a critical role in regulating our nation’s financial institutions.</p>



<p>Despite her readiness—and despite having been confirmed by the Senate with broad, bipartisan support twice in the past—Sarah was subject to baseless attacks from industry and conservative interest groups. Unfortunately, Senate Republicans are more focused on amplifying these false claims and protecting special interests than taking important steps toward addressing inflation and lowering costs for the American people.</p>



<p>I am grateful for Sarah’s service to our country and for her willingness to serve again, and I look forward to her future contributions to our country.</p>



<p>I urge the Senate Banking Committee to move swiftly to confirm the four eminently qualified nominees for the Board of Governors—Jerome Powell, Lael Brainard, Philip Jefferson, and Lisa Cook—who are still waiting for an up-or-down vote. This group has the experience, judgment, and talent necessary to lead the Federal Reserve at this critical moment in our economic recovery, and the Senate should move their nominations forward.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Via Teleconference</p>



<p>10:36 A.M. EDT<br><br>     MR. MUNOZ:  Hey, everybody.  Thanks you for joining us &#8212; Happy Tuesday &#8212; for this press call today.  We are going to outline the consequences that a lack of COVID-19 response funding will have on the United States if Congress fails to act.<br><br>     The call and the accompanying factsheet that you all just received before this will be on background, attributable to “senior administration officials,” and embargoed until 11:30 a.m. Eastern.<br><br>     On today’s call, we have [senior administration officials].<br><br>     With that, I will kick it to [senior administration official] for some opening remarks.<br><br>     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thanks, Kevin.  Good morning, everyone.  Thanks for joining us.<br><br>Today, we want to cover the consequences of a lack of additional funding for the nation’s COVID response.<br><br>I’ll discuss the near-term impacts, and then I’ll turn to [senior administration official] to discuss the impacts on our longer-term preparedness.<br><br>First, I want to step back and provide some context on how we view this moment in the pandemic.<br><br>Over the past 14 months, the country has made critical investments, using resources that Congress provided on a bipartisan basis, to make sure the American people have access to free and widely available tools: vaccines, boosters, treatments, tests, and high-quality masks.<br><br>As a result, the U.S. has made tremendous progress: Cases are down 95 percent since the peak of Omicron.  Hospitalizations are down 85 percent.  Over 215 million Americans are fully vaccinated, and over 95 million Americans have received a booster shot.<br><br>But as the President said in the State of the Union, we still have more work to do.<br><br>Our scientific and medical experts have been clear that in the next couple of months we could see COVID cases increase here in the U.S., just as we’re seeing cases rising abroad right now.<br><br>That’s why we remain laser-focused on fighting COVID and preparing for the future.<br><br>The President has laid out a comprehensive National COVID-19 Preparedness Plan to continue the progress we’ve made and to ensure we keep the country moving forward safely.<br><br>We asked for immediate funding needed to start to implement that plan.<br><br>In fact, for months, we’ve made clear to Congress, on a bipartisan basis, that the funding for tests, treatments, and vaccines was drying up and that additional funds would be needed.<br><br>In January, we notified the Hill that funding would be needed after the Omicron surge.  In February, we briefed appropriators and authorizers about the status of funds and the consequences if there were no additional funds.<br><br>We sent a formal request of $22.5 billion to the Hill, again being clear of what we could not do without more funding.<br><br>The President called for additional funding in his State of the Union address; outlined in a 96-page plan, made clear that more funding is needed. <br><br>And our team has held more than two dozen calls and meetings with members of Congress about this emergency funding request. <br><br>We have been clear: We hoped Congress would provide these resources, as lawmakers have done multiple times on a bipartisan basis under the prior administration.<br><br>Further inaction will set us back; leave us unprepared &#8212; less prepared; and cost us more lives.<br><br>We need Congress to provide the $22.5 billion in emergency immediate funding.<br><br>Now, let me walk through some of the immediate consequences of a lack of funding.<br><br>First, on vaccines: Without additional funding, we do not have the adequate resources to purchase enough booster shots for all Americans if an additional shot is needed.<br><br>Keep in mind, when Congress passed the supplemental bill in December of 2020 and the American Rescue Plan, the mRNA vaccines were envisioned as a two-shot vaccine.  We’ve now administered nearly 100 million booster shots, and four shots are now recommended and available for immunocompromised people.<br><br>To ensure enough fourth doses for all Americans or a variant-specific vaccine should we ever need them, we must have funding in hand.<br><br>Vaccines are our most effective tool.  We cannot be caught without the ability to move quickly to get more of the most effective vaccines available as soon as we are able.<br><br>Next, on treatments: To date, we have shipped over 7 million courses of treatments to the American people.  And in many cases, we have sent federal medical personnel to states to help administer those treatments.  When Omicron hit, the federal government stepped in to ramp up delivery of the last remaining treatment that worked.<br><br>These efforts have saved lives in every state in the country.<br><br>We have planned &#8212; we had planned to purchase additional monoclonals as soon as next week.  Without additional funding, we are cancelling those plans.  And as we will make clear to governors later this morning, we also need to cut the number of monoclonal antibody treatments we send to states by 30 percent starting next week.<br><br>Even with these cuts, we anticipate that our supply of monoclonal antibody treatments will run out as soon as late May.<br><br>Next, on the preventative treatments for immunocompromised Americans: We have purchased 1.7 million doses of AstraZeneca’s Evusheld &#8212; all that they could produce to date.<br><br>AstraZeneca recently told us that they will be &#8212; they will have additional supply that will be available for delivery starting in September.  These are doses we had planned to purchase as soon as the end of March.<br><br>Without more funding, the federal government will now be forced to scale back on that purchase.  So, we’ll likely run out of treatments for our most vulnerable Americans by the end of the year, if not sooner.<br><br>The bottom line on treatments is this: Without additional funding soon, thousands of patients could lose access to treatments, and these companies will have little incentive to continue investing in the development and manufacturing of these treatments.<br><br>Next, on the uninsured fund: <s>The Office of Management and Budget</s> [The Administration] notified Congress in February that this fund that reimburses doctors and other medical providers for caring for uninsured individuals was running out of money and would have to stop taking new claims in March.<br><br>Unfortunately, we’re now having to take that action.<br><br>HHS will begin to scale back this program starting next week and end it completely in early April.<br><br>This means doctors, nurses, pharmacists, labs, and other healthcare providers will no longer be reimbursed for tests, treatments, and vaccinations for people without health insurance.<br><br>And finally, in addition to all of these impacts to our domestic response, the lack of funding greatly impacts our global response.<br><br>Without more funding, USAID and our interagency partners will have to cut short efforts to turn vaccines into vaccinations around the world.<br><br>In fact, the administration won’t be able to extend surge support to over 20 additional under-vaccinated countries that will need intensive support this year to get shots in arms.<br><br>This will devastate our ability to ensure these countries can effectively deploy safe and effective vaccines.  And leaving large unvaccinated populations worldwide will increase the risk of new deadly emerging &#8212; of variants emerging that could evade our current vaccines and treatments. <br><br>Without additional funding, USAID will also be unable to provide lifesaving supplies, tests, therapeutics, oxygen, and other humanitarian aid to countries still struggling to manage a continued COVID disease burden.<br><br>Now, I’ll turn it over to [senior administration official] to discuss some of the long-term preparedness efforts at risk.  [Senior administration official]?<br><br>One second.<br><br>[Senior administration official], can you unmute?<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  [Senior administration official], do you have me now?<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I got you.  Go for it.<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Oh, my goodness.  Okay, sorry about that.<br><br>All right.  So, thanks, [senior administration official].  Thanks, everybody.  Let me also start with vaccines.<br><br>Without additional support from Congress, NIH and BARDA will lack the funding needed to accelerate research and development of next-generation vaccines that provide broader and more durable protection, including a vaccine that protects against a range of variants.<br><br>We’ll face a similar challenge on treatments.  The current antivirals require multiple pills over several days.  We think it’s possible to get treatment courses down to one or two pills, but that requires additional research and funding.<br><br>And when a new vaccine or treatment becomes available, it’s important for us to have the funding to secure enough doses for the American people.<br><br>Over the past 14 months, we’ve put the massive purchasing power of the federal government to use, making sure America is first in line for promising treatments.<br><br>That’s the reason we’ve been able to secure more Pfizer antiviral pills than anyone else in the world.  These pills cut the risk of hospitalization and death by 90 percent.<br><br>Without additional funding, we lack the resources needed to get behind promising new treatments, meaning less supply available to the American people.<br><br>So the failure to invest in the research and the advanced purchase of lifesaving treatments and new vaccines now will leave the nation vulnerable in the face of a new variant or a new surge.<br><br>Finally, on testing: We have significantly increased our testing capacity in this country through targeted federal investments.<br><br>Without additional funding, we do not have the ability to maintain our domestic testing capacity beyond June.<br><br>So, after spending the last year building up our testing capacity, Congress now risks squandering that capacity heading into the second half of this year. <br><br>And because it takes months of ramp-up to rebuild capacity, failure to invest now will leave us less prepared for any potential future surges.  So providing funding only when cases rise is far too late to make a difference.<br><br>Bottom line: We need funding now so we’re prepared for whatever comes next.<br><br>With that, back over to you, [senior administration official].<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thanks, [senior administration official].  Let me just close with a few thoughts here.<br><br>We have been clear-eyed and we are clear-eyed moving forward about how unpredictable this virus has been and can be moving forward.<br><br>Omicron was the most contagious variant we’ve ever seen.  It led to an unprecedented increase in cases.  But because we had the resources, we were able to surge support to Americans that needed it.<br><br>We sent tests to homes, masks to pharmacies, over 2,500 federal personnel to states, more treatments to providers.  We kept our businesses open and almost all of our kids learning in person. <br><br>That was because we had resources at our disposal to act and to act quickly. <br><br>We have a plan to keep it that way, but we need the resources to execute that plan. <br><br>The failure to provide additional resources soon will have severe consequences in the near term, as I’ve outlined: fewer monoclonal antibodies treatments, fewer tests, fewer treatments for the immunocompromised, and a risk of running short on vaccines.<br><br>We want to be clear: Waiting to provide funding until we’re in a worse spot with the virus will be too late.<br><br>Importantly, when you consider the cost of all these investments compared to the cost of what we will prevent &#8212; in terms of hospitalizations, deaths, and damage to our healthcare system and our economy &#8212; it is not a close call.<br><br>With that. let&#8217;s open up for questions. <br><br>MR. MUNOZ:  Thanks.  We have time for a few questions.  First, let&#8217;s go to Josh Wingrove at Bloomberg. <br><br>Q    Hi there.  Thank you.  Can you tell us a little bit more about the monoclonal order in terms of the scale?  Like how many were you planning to order?  If you don&#8217;t order it now, do you lose your spot in line?  And, you know, if new funding came in the following weeks, would you still be able to place that order?<br><br>And, more broadly, you mentioned, on fourth shots &#8212; can you specify: Right now, you think you have enough for immunocompromised people that are currently eligible, but without new funding, you might not have enough in the event that the broader population would need a fourth shot or be given the option to get a fourth shot? <br><br>Thank you. <br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thanks, Josh.  I&#8217;ll start, and maybe, [senior administration official], you can add.<br><br>On your first question on monoclonals, the purchase was likely to be in the hundreds of thousands of more doses.  We had planned to place that order next week on March 25th. <br><br>I can&#8217;t say whether those &#8212; you&#8217;d have to ask the company whether those would be available to us if we purchased at a later date.  That was the plan.  And as we know, these are &#8212; these are treatments that are highly sought after not just in this country but in other countries. <br><br>And so, we have to end that purchase and we have to reduce the allocations to our states by 30 percent but that we&#8217;re stretching out the supply as long as we possibly can. <br><br>On the fourth shot, we have enough now for immunocompromised individuals who need to seek a fourth shot.  What we don&#8217;t have the funding for is if all Americans were needed to get an additional dose, we would need additional funding from Congress. <br><br>And importantly, Josh, I would add that if we need a variant-specific testing, which heretofore we have been lucky enough not to need, but we want to be ready for that.  And if we need a new vaccine, we have &#8212; our gap in resources is even more severe if we need a variant-specific vaccine. <br><br>{Senior administration official}, anything you would add?<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Sure, [senior administration official].  Thank you.  I think you said it exactly right. <br><br>The other thing I would just add is we have to make these purchases now so the product is available in the coming months.  It requires several months for some of the manufacturing to take place.  So, to secure our place in line, we have to make the purchases now to bring these doses forward in the coming weeks to months. <br><br>MR. MUNOZ:  Thanks.  Next question.  Let&#8217;s go to Jeremy Diamond at CNN. <br><br>Q    Hey, thanks very much for doing this.  Just searching for some more concrete numbers on the testing front.  What are we at now in terms of tests per month?  And how would that number be impacted after June?<br><br>And then secondly, if there were to be a game-changing variant spreading wildly in the U.S., you know, say, tomorrow, is the U.S. prepared for that?<br><br>And after which point in time would we not be prepared without additional funding?<br><br>Thanks. <br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thanks, Jeremy.  It&#8217;s a good question. <br><br>On tests per month, we&#8217;re in the hundreds of millions of tests per month now.  That&#8217;s because of the investments over the last 14 months in getting to that point. <br><br>We don&#8217;t know, after June, if we can maintain the domestic manufacturing capabilities that we have today.  In fact, we were told by the domestic test manufacturers that they cannot.  We&#8217;ve made investments to get us to June.  We need additional funding from Congress to not lose the gains that we&#8217;ve made over the last 14 months in the domestic testing manufacturing. <br><br>So, it&#8217;s vitally important that we continue that manufacturing so we don&#8217;t lose everything that we&#8217;ve done in over-the-counter testing in the last year. <br><br>On variants, look, what I can say, Jeremy, is we will &#8212; we are well less prepared without additional funding than we would be otherwise.  We laid out an entire plan in 96 pages of detail for how we want to be prepared moving forward and to be prepared.  We were clear in that plan, we were clear in the State of the Union, and we&#8217;ve been clear with Congress for the past few months that we need additional funding to do that. <br><br>MR. MUNOZ:  Let&#8217;s go to Rachel Roubein at the Washington Post. <br><br>Q    Hi, thanks for taking my question.  I was wondering: Have you guys had any conversations in the past few days with Congress about lowering the funding number at all from 15.6 billion? <br><br>And then, also, have you talked with lawmakers in recent days on additional pay-fors out of existing funds to replace the state and local aid pay-for that was taken out of the bill?<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thanks, Rachel.  On your first question on the conversations with Congress to reduce the funding, the answer is no.  We need &#8212; we&#8217;ve submitted emergency requests for $22.5 billion, and we stand by that request.<br><br>On the pay-fors, you know, we&#8217;ll leave it to Congress the details of how they get this over the finish line in Congress.  But I think there&#8217;s bipartisan recognition that we need this money.  There&#8217;s recognition of the money they provided over a year ago has been well spent.  And we defer to Congress on the specific legislative approach. <br><br>But I will say that there is precedence, including in the prior administration multiple times, to provide direct COVID response funding on a bipartisan basis without offsets.<br><br>And so, we hope and expect that we&#8217;ll be able to rely on that precedent moving forward. <br><br>MR. MUNOZ:  Let&#8217;s go to Tamara Keith at NPR. <br><br>Q    Apologies.  Two years in, I can&#8217;t figure out mute. <br><br>Thank you for taking my question.  I&#8217;m hoping that you can sort of explain the mechanics of the markets for these various things, like why the government still needs to be involved in making these large purchases; why, you know, large hospital groups couldn&#8217;t be buying the vaccines or buying the monoclonal antibodies; like, why &#8212; why it is all so contingent on federal funds.<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yeah.  Tamara, it’s a good question.<br><br>Look, in our preparedness plan, we outlined that we want to explore in the future the ability to transition some of COVID treatments and potentially other tools to insurance-based market, like other healthcare. <br><br>But I think our priority from the beginning is to make sure that in a once-in-a-generation pandemic that has killed over 960,000 Americans, that we&#8217;re taking the measures that are necessary to make those widely available, free, and accessible to all Americans. <br><br>That&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve done with monoclonal antibody.  That&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve done with the Pfizer pills and the Merck pills.  That’s what we’ve done with testing.  And that&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve done with, obviously, vaccines.<br><br>We think it&#8217;s the right thing at this moment to continue to move forward with that. <br><br>And I&#8217;d say most important, when we have a variant that strikes like we had with Omicron, our ability as the federal government to use our purchasing power as a government to purchase all of those things, all of those tools, and get them available to all Americans on an equitable basis saves lives.  And it was fundamental in Omicron, and I would &#8212; we would argue it&#8217;s fundamental if a variant were to come in the next few months.<br><br>So, yes, we want to explore over the long term a safe, a smooth transition.  But right now, we have immediate needs, and we need Congress to act.<br><br>MR. MUNOZ:  Let’s go to Sheryl Stolberg at the New York Times.<br><br>Sheryl?  All right, Sheryl, we&#8217;ll come back to you.<br><br>Let&#8217;s go to Zeke Miller at the AP.<br><br>Q    Hey.  Thanks for doing this.  Just to follow up on Tam&#8217;s question there: So, why not, if &#8212; you know, if the need is immediate and Congress right now shows no sign of budging, aren&#8217;t you exploring those alternate avenues?  You know, you just required private insurers to cover the cost of at-home tests.  Why not have them cover the cost of vaccines and Paxlovid and other things like that? <br><br>Why does the government still need to be the middleman there, given the current rate of COVID-impacted society and mortality?  I mean, how is that different than, you know, cancer or heart disease, other things where insurance is &#8212; the private insurance market is already effective there?<br><br>And then, separately, lawmakers on Capitol Hill have been, you know, complaining about that lack of outreach over the last several week &#8212; several weeks from the White House.  Why did it take until, you know, just the last couple of months for the White House to sort of sound the alarm here?  Shouldn’t this have been something that you all raised the alarm on last year as this &#8212; as these funds were being rapidly depleted?<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thanks, Zeke.  So, on your first question, I&#8217;d say, look, we are exploring those alternatives.  We made that clear in the &#8212; in the Preparedness Plan that we released a few weeks ago.  But it takes time, as you know, to move to that &#8212; to such a system.  We &#8212; it needs to be an orderly, smooth transition.  So we&#8217;re working through that. </p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#8217;d also say, though, especially for things like vaccines, but in fact for all of our tools, the United States competes against other countries to get access &#8212; preferential access, as much as we can, to those tools.&nbsp; So we shouldn&#8217;t be fooled that if we move to this market that we would still be able to provide Americans the early access to the tools that we have worked really hard for the last 14 months to be able to provide.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So if you think about a scenario where we had another variant or if we need a variant-specific vaccine, if the U.S. government sees our responsibility to provide and purchase those, you know, insurance companies would be competing against other countries to provide those, to try to purchase those, as opposed to the U.S. government stepping in and making sure that all Americans have easy, free access to something that can save their life.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So it&#8217;s certainly something we’re exploring.&nbsp; But it needs to be a smooth transition, an orderly transition, and there are certain places where we want to make sure that we are able to step in as the federal government and provide that access where we think it is merited.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To your second question on outreach: You know, we have been clear with Congress since mid-January that funds in our existing balances were low.&nbsp; We briefed appropriators and authorizers in February on our immediate needs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also in February, we sent a document to the Hill clearly outlining the near-term consequences of no funding, which included specifically saying things like the uninsured fund would have to stop taking claims in March &#8212; we are now in March; monoclonals would stock out in May if we didn&#8217;t have funds by March; that AstraZeneca for immunocompromised would stock out this summer if we didn&#8217;t have funds in March.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We then &#8212; the Acting Director of OMB, Shalanda Young, sent a letter to Congress in March &#8212; early March asking for the $22.5 billion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So we&#8217;ve been clear with Congress on how funds were dwindling in these accounts and that there were &#8212; there were going to be immediate consequences of that.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re making that &#8212; those consequences clear again today.</p>



<p>     MR. MUNOZ:  Next question, let’s go to Jeff Mason at Reuters.<br><br>Q    Thanks very much.  Two questions.  One, can you &#8212; I know, [senior administration official], that you said you would leave the mechanics of how Congress did this to Congress, but can you just outline what the options are at this point?  Do you expect that Democrats would have to put this into a separate bill or the reconciliation bill?  Or what is your expectation at least for options on how on how to get this across the finish line?<br><br>And secondly, I saw that Punchbowl wrote a story this morning about a letter that you&#8217;ve written to Congress about this.  Can you get us that letter or confirm that that was written?<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thanks, Jeff.  So, [senior administration official] on mechanics, and I welcome [senior administration official] to jump in here after I talk if they want to add. <br><br>But, you know, I think, as I mentioned, there are many avenues that Congress can do to move to move this funding forward.  The &#8212; what we see is past precedent under the prior administration for bipartisan support for funds for direct COVID response to save lives that were provided multiple times without offsets.  So we think there&#8217;s clearly a precedent for that.  We&#8217;re asking for $22.5 billion for immediate funding, and we think Congress should move on that.<br><br>I say on reconciliation &#8212; again, I defer to Congress, but we need this money now.  These are immediate, near-term consequences, some of which we&#8217;re having to act on this week, next week, and the first week of April.  So, time is not on our side; we need we need the funding immediately.<br><br>And then on the letter to Congress that&#8217;s being sent today &#8212; and we&#8217;ll make sure that folks have access to that.<br><br>MR. MUNOZ:  Last question, let&#8217;s go to Cheyenne Haslett at ABC News.<br><br>Q    Thank you.  Hi, guys.  So, I wanted to clarify on testing: Is capacity declining this month, as we previously heard in March, or do you have enough on that front to get through June unscathed, [senior administration official], as you said, just a bit ago?<br><br>And then on Test to Treat: Can that new program still go on?  Are there enough antivirals to support that or is that going to have to be scaled back?<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thanks.  On testing capacity, [senior administration official], I don&#8217;t know if you want to add here, but we have domestic manufacturing capability to sustain our domestic manufacturing capability until June.  And at that point, it will greatly diminish.<br><br>[Senior administration official], anything you’d add on testing?<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, I think that&#8217;s exactly right.  Due to federal support, we&#8217;ve been able to maintain this manufacturing capacity, even though as [senior administration official] mentioned, we are hearing from our domestic manufacturers that demand from other places is starting to crater. <br><br>So, it&#8217;s very important that we have this federal funding to support that manufacturing.  And we anticipate we can keep it going through June.<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thanks.  And then, Cheyenne, just on your second question: We do have the pills to do Test to Treat.  We do not, however, have funding &#8212; and this is clear in the materials we put out &#8212; to make any additional purchases of Pfizer pills beyond the ones that we&#8217;ve made.<br><br>MR. MUNOZ:  All right.  Well, thank you, everybody, for joining today.<br><br>As a reminder, this call is embargoed until 11:30 and attributable to “senior administration officials.”<br><br>Let me know if you have any other questions, and have a good day.<br><br>11:03 A.M. EDT</p>
