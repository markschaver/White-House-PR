<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>East Room</em></p>



<p>2:43 P.M. EST</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE PRESIDENT: &nbsp; Well, Cateo, I tell you what, you didn&#8217;t there &#8212; we have a little ongoing thing in &#8212; in the administration.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As you&#8217;ve mentioned, there are a fair number of African Americans in high places in my administration, but &#8212; and I&#8217;m always hearing about Howard &#8212; great school; I&#8217;m hearing about Morgan men; I&#8217;m hearing about &#8212; you know, all these other things.&nbsp; But I keep talking about it: Delaware State.&nbsp; (Laughter.)</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And although I went to the University of Delaware, I tell you &#8212; there&#8217;s an old expression: &#8220;I tell you who brung me to the dance.&#8221;&nbsp; Delaware State University is in the southern &#8212; the middle of my state &#8212; in Dover, Delaware.&nbsp; And the lower &#8212; we have the eighth-largest Black population in America, as a percent of the population.&nbsp; And the lower two counties are fairly conservative compared to the northern county.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I &#8212; I operated out of Delaware State for a significant portion of my career and campaign, as the gentlewoman from the state of Delaware can tell you.&nbsp; (Laughter.)</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And there was a guy named Tony Allen who used to work for me &#8212; worked for me for years.&nbsp; He went out and he got his PhD.&nbsp; Then he left and became a president.&nbsp; You know, he&#8217;s now &#8212; Tony, stand up &#8212; president of Delaware State University.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I learned a long time, from good friends of mine in Delaware in the Civil Rights community, that if you want to know where the real power in America lies, it&#8217;s in the Divine Nine.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; We&#8217;re in the only administration in history that actually has an office.&nbsp; Right, Jim?&nbsp; We have a Divine Nine office.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, I &#8212; I understand &#8212; I understand, as they say, who &#8220;brung me to the dance.&#8221;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And all kidding aside, you&#8217;re going to be incredible, old buddy.&nbsp; You&#8217;re going to do well.&nbsp; You&#8217;re going to do very well.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, you know, there is a &#8212; I don&#8217;t know if they&#8217;ve been introduced, but my Secretary of Defense &#8212; Secretary Austin &#8212; stand up.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My Secretary of Housing, Secretary Fudge.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My Administrator &#8212; the guy who&#8217;s running and taking care of the EPA and all the rest &#8212; from Carolina &#8212; (laughs) &#8212; Administrator Regan.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And Acting Director of OMB &#8212; the woman who has all &#8212; controls all the money &#8212; (laughter) &#8212; Shalanda &#8212; Shalanda Young.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And a woman who &#8212; I really mean it &#8212; has let the whole world know who we are.&nbsp; No, really.&nbsp; A woman who has been so incredibly effective in her job.&nbsp; But it wasn&#8217;t until recently &#8212; until the outrage of Putin and Soviet Union &#8212; and the Soviet Union &#8212; trying to re-establish the Soviet Union, basically, but &#8212; and Russia.&nbsp; To hear her, to listen to her run the debates on &#8212; at the Security Council, as well as the General Assembly at the United Nations &#8212; Linda Greenhouse [sic] &#8212; Thomas-Greenfield.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And a woman who knows a little bit about the economy &#8212; Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, Ceci- &#8212; (laughs) &#8212; I kid her all the time, being from Princeton, but &#8212; (laughter) &#8212; (inaudible).&nbsp; Cecilia, congratulations.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, Mr. Secretary &#8212; I&#8217;m talking about Cateo right now &#8212; (laughter) &#8212; I think they&#8217;re ready to elect you anything you want to be, pal.&nbsp; (Laughter.)</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Look, I want to welcome everyone to the White House.&nbsp; This has been &#8212; it&#8217;s been a long drought, the last year and a half, not being able to have not just Black History Month, we weren&#8217;t &#8212; not able to have any gathering here at the White House of any crowd at all.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s good to have you back.&nbsp; It&#8217;s wonderful to be able to host this event in person.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And it’s great to see so many friends.&nbsp; If I begin calling out &#8212; calling the roll, we&#8217;ll be all night here, and I don&#8217;t want to do that.&nbsp; But so many significant leaders who&#8217;ve changed the face of America sitting in the audience, not on this stage.&nbsp; So, thank you all so very, very, very much.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My name is Joe Biden.&nbsp; I&#8217;m Jill Biden&#8217;s husband.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; As you&#8217;ve already figured out, I can&#8217;t dance.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; I do it, but I ain&#8217;t good at it.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; And &#8212; (laughs) &#8212; oh man, you have great opportunities now, don&#8217;t you, Jilly.&nbsp; (Laughter.)</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tomorrow, I&#8217;m going to be delivering the State of the Union Address.&nbsp; And today, I simply want to thank you for all you’ve done for me, for all of the country.&nbsp;&nbsp; So much has been accomplished in the people in this room.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Black History Month is more than a celebration.&nbsp; It’s a powerful, powerful reminder that Black history is American history.&nbsp; Black culture is American culture.&nbsp; Black stories are essentially an ongoing story of America.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I see it every day with the Vice President and the incredible job she&#8217;s doing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We see it in the Black members of the Cab- &#8212; my Cabinet and the White House staff who are here today, who serve to defend the nation; protect the planet; build the economy; deliver housing, jobs, and justice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And we see it the tireless, heroic efforts of the Congressional Black Caucus.&nbsp; And I want to &#8212; I&#8217;m going to embarrass him, but I want &#8212; the former Chairman of the Black Caucus has come over to help me run things.&nbsp; Cedric, stand up.&nbsp; Let everybody see you.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I used to &#8212; I never played golf until I was 46 years old.&nbsp; I got to be pretty good.&nbsp; Then I &#8212; and I asked Cedric to help me in my campaign.&nbsp; Then I played golf, and he beat the hell out of me.&nbsp; I wish I had never done it.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; I don’t know.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so many state and local leaders and faith leaders here &#8212; lawyers, educators &#8212; that are here today.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, of course, we see another first in the nomination of Ketanji &#8212; well, you saw her.&nbsp; I guess you saw Justice Brown &#8212; Justice Brown Jackson, who is on the &#8212; on the Circuit Court of Appeals right now.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is an incredible woman.&nbsp; This is a woman who graduated magna cum laude from Harvard.&nbsp; She graduated &#8212; she was editor of the Law Review.&nbsp; She has done so many other things.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I want to make it clear: Not only is she is eminently qualified, there were so many others I had to choose from.&nbsp; I can tell you, Jim &#8212; Jim is &#8212; supported all the nominees, but the one he most supported (inaudible) &#8212; I&#8217;ve already nominated her to be on the Circuit Court of Appeals, the second-highest court in the nation.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Judge &#8212; Judge Jackson is going to be an outstanding justice.&nbsp; She&#8217;s part of an incredible group of Black women who I’ve nominated to the federal bench.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve nominated more Black women to the federal bench than any administration in the history of the United States of America.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, I made that commitment when I was running for President, and I&#8217;ve tried to keep that commitment my whole career.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You know, and the first executive order I signed when I came into office &#8212; and it was with Cedric&#8217;s help.&nbsp; I sat down, put pencil to paper &#8212; or pen to paper, and signed a &#8212; I instructed every single element of my administration, every department, from the Defense Department to the &#8212; to the Justice Department and on, that equity should be the center of our &#8212; all of what we do.&nbsp; And we did that in the COVID-19 response.&nbsp; Remember at the beginning, everyone was concerned whether or not, as usual, African Americans would be left behind.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, we helped Black &#8212; they &#8212; we helped raise the vaccination rate among Black Americans and bring it on par with white adults.&nbsp; All &#8212; the same across the board.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I want to thank the members of the Black Coalition Against COVID represented here today as well.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>And I also want to thank Derrick Jones, also as D-Nice &#8212; (laughter) &#8212; for being &#8212; stand up, man.&nbsp; Let them see who you are.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; He provided the soundtrack of hope to keep our spirits up during the worst days of that pandemic.&nbsp; And thank you, thank you, thank you, man.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>You know, when I took office, I said, “the American story depends not on&#8221; how many of us &#8212; &#8220;any one of us, not on some of us, but on all of us.”&nbsp; “On all of us.”&nbsp; So, we’re investing in all of us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So many of you here helped enact the American Rescue Plan to deliver immediate economic relief with Rescue checks, to tax cuts, to eliminate &#8212; and the estimate is that we’ve cut Black poverty by over 30 percent.&nbsp; We’ve reduced child poverty by more than 50 percent in the Black community.</p>



<p>The American Rescue Plan also included historic funding that allowed cities and states to invest in community violence intervention programs and keep neighborhoods safe.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Look, you were critical in getting the Infrastructure Law passed &#8212; a bipartisan bill that’s going to get &#8212; that’s going to do so much.&nbsp; It’s going to replace decades of disinvestment in the United States of America.&nbsp; A commitment to reconnecting communities and people and job opportunities.&nbsp; Lots &#8212; so much of what they &#8212; the early investments in highways and in interstates &#8212; they cut neighborhoods in half.&nbsp; They divided things.&nbsp; We can put it back together again.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Clean water.&nbsp; High-speed Internet.&nbsp; It’s going to &#8212; we’re going to eliminate every lead pipe in America so our children don’t have to worry about whether they&#8217;re drinking poison water, in effect.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And as part of that law, we made Minority Business Development Agency permanent and seeded it with $110 million so Black businesses can get the capital they need to grow.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>And I’m also proud to be joined by Opal Lee, when &#8212; we made the Juneteenth the first federal holiday in the last 40 years.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; It’s good to see Ms. Lee here.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>You know, we’ve made landmark investments of $5.8 billion in Historic Black Colleges and Universities not just because we’ve got some serious advocates for Howard and Morehouse &#8212; (laughter) &#8212; and other HBCUs you’ve heard of, like Delaware and others.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; But all &#8212; but all kidding aside, because they offer so much promise to the nation &#8212; so much promise.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s good to see the many HBCU leaders here tonight, including Dr. Devona Williams of Delaware State; Tony Allen &#8212; I mean, Tony of Delaware State, chair of the Board of Advisors of HBCUs.</p>



<p>And, look &#8212; and I want all of you to know, we’re ready to closely investigate the cowardly, un-American bomb threats against HBCUs.&nbsp; That’s underway.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have so much more to do as a nation on making everyday things more accessible and affordable.&nbsp; As my friend Jim Clyburn says, “That’s the test of whether government delivers.”&nbsp; Are they accessible and affordable?&nbsp; Prescription drugs.&nbsp; Child care.&nbsp; Housing.&nbsp; Make healthcare more affordable and make progress on Black maternal health, something that Kamala has been leading the effort on.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; To end cancer as we know it by putting science and technology to work to address the inequities in testing and diagnosis and access to care.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, you know, we’ve got work to do to deliver police and criminal justice reform as well.&nbsp; Even though Congress isn’t acting, we are making changes in federal law enforcement policies: banning chokeholds, restrictions on no-knock warrants, requirements on federal &#8212; for federal agents to wear and activate their body cameras, ending the Department of Justice’s use of private prisons.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All of this is being &#8212; is happening.&nbsp; And the Justice Department has opened pattern-and-practice investigations for systemic police misconduct in several key police departments in the country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’ve just got to stay on it.&nbsp; With your help, we’re going to keep pushing on this.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And we &#8212; we’re protecting our country’s threshold liberty, the sacred right to vote, which I’ve never seen as under such attack.&nbsp; You know, it’s always made it harder for Blacks to vote, but this is trying to be able to figure out how to keep the Black vote, when it occurs, from even counting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over the past year, we’ve directed federal agencies to promote access to voting.&nbsp; We’ve &#8212; we’ve appointed top civil rights advocates to help the U.S. Department of Justice, which is &#8212; has doubled the number of voting rights enforcement on &#8212; enforcement folks on their staff.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, again, we call on Congress: Pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Pass the Freedom to Vote Act.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; We can do this.&nbsp; The American people agree with us &#8212; Black and white, Hispanic and all.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let me conclude with this.&nbsp; Look &#8212; I don’t want to take much more of your time, but let me conclude with this: I know progress can be slow and frustrating.&nbsp; But I also know it’s possible if we work together, if we keep the faith, if we remember the changes and the charges that have passed down to us from all those who came before us &#8212; many sitting in this room right now.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You’ve heard &#8212; you know, as you‘ve heard, we had a wonderful exhibit downstairs celebrating Black History Month.&nbsp; And I want to thank Lonnie Bunch and the Smithsonian, as well as the Library of Congress for their &#8212; giving us access to their collection.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When I introduced Judge Jackson on Friday out in the hallway here, I thought about the display that holds the signature of the Judicial Oath of Office sworn and signed by Thurgood Marshall himself.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It was Justice Marshall who reminded us, in a speech shortly before he died, and I quote, “America can do better because America has no choice but to do better.”&nbsp; “America has no choice but to do better.”&nbsp; It’s a powerful reminder of the history of the journey of America and the power each of us hold to write a more just and hopeful chapter.&nbsp; And I really mean it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I am more optimistic about our chances to bring equity to this country than we ever have before now.</p>



<p>And if you wonder about it, just take a look &#8212; take a look at the dif- &#8212; the reason I have so much hope is the younger generation.&nbsp; Those folks be &#8212; they learn from grade school through 30 years of age.&nbsp; Look at what&#8217;s going on.&nbsp; Look at how they act with one another.&nbsp; There&#8217;s not this isolation.&nbsp; There is everything you see &#8212; everything you see from television commercials, down to how we act with one another.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have so much going for us.&nbsp; We got to just let them have their shot.</p>



<p>Folks, I want to thank you all for being here.&nbsp; I really mean it.&nbsp; I want to thank you for all you&#8217;ve done, all that we can do, and being committed that we&#8217;re going to do so much more.</p>



<p>So thank you, thank you, thank you.&nbsp; May God bless you all.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>(The President and First Lady move to exit.)</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. President, should Americans be worried about nuclear war?</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; No.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Today, the White House and the Department of Justice announced 99 law schools have responded to the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/ag/page/file/1428626/download">Attorney General’s Call to Action to the Legal Profession</a>, issued on August 30, 2021, to address the housing and eviction crisis. The Attorney General’s Call to Action asked lawyers and law students to take immediate action to help their communities through Emergency Rental Assistance application support, volunteering with legal aid providers, helping courts implement eviction diversion programs, among other initiatives aimed at increasing housing stability and access to justice.</p>



<p><strong>The Response from the Legal Profession to the Attorney General’s Call to Action was Swift and Wide Reaching and Helped to Keep Eviction Filings Below 60% of Historic Averages.</strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>99 law schools in 35 states and Puerto Rico immediately committed their law schools to help prevent evictions</strong>. These law schools worked with faculty and students to take immediate and meaningful action to combat the crisis. (See appendix for list of law schools and activities.)</li><li><strong>Over the past five months, over 2,100 law students dedicated over 81,000 hours to serve over 10,000 households</strong>, based on a survey tracking the effort facilitated by Georgetown University Law Center Dean William Treanor and New York University School of Law Dean Trevor Morrison.</li></ul>



<p><strong>The Biden-Harris Administration Implemented a Whole-of-Government Push to </strong><strong>Encourage Immediate Relief and Lasting Reform on Eviction Policy Nationwide</strong><strong>. </strong>The Call to Action by the Attorney General and the response from 99 law schools is part of a whole-of-government approach to help millions of families keep up on rent and remain in their homes. The effort has led to increased access to counsel and eviction prevention in jurisdictions across the country.</p>

<p><strong>Broad Legal Community Answered the Call of Attorney General</strong><strong>:</strong> Beyond law schools, Presidents of several major legal organizations, including the American Bar Association, National Bar Association, Hispanic National Bar Association, National Conference of Bar Presidents, and Legal Services Corporation, adopted eviction prevention as a priority and encouraged action among members. Within 24 hours of the Attorney General’s Call to Action, the Association for Pro Bono Counsel and Law Firm Antiracism Alliance, which has nearly 300 law firm members, hosted trainings for hundreds of pro bono attorneys on assisting tenants with ERA applications.<br><strong>Historic Progress on Emergency Rental Assistance Program &#8211; Aiding Renters and Preventing Evictions</strong>:<br>The rapidly increasing pace of rental assistance, along with efforts to put into place eviction diversion programs, helped dramatically increase relief for those in need following the end of the national eviction moratorium. Instead of the predicted tsunami of evictions, because of the Administration’s efforts to implement rental assistance programs and provide flexibility to grantees, eviction filings have remained below 60% of historic averages nationally and well below the 3.7 million evictions filed in a typical year. Representing a historic effort to prevent eviction, well over 3 million households received Emergency Rental Assistance under the program, with approximately <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0551">$25-$30 billion in ERA funds either spent or obligated by the end of 2021</a>.<br><br><strong>99 Law Schools Took Meaningful Action to Expand Access to Justice and Increase Housing Stability</strong><strong>:</strong><br>On the same day the Attorney General issued the Call to Action, the Deans of 99 law schools issued a statement of support and committed to take immediate and meaningful action to combat the eviction and housing crisis. The law schools acted with urgency and, over the past five months, have continued to draw on resources—such as pro bono and externship programs, clinical offerings, and the service of the larger law school communities—to respond to the Attorney General’s call. Law schools partnered with ERA programs, community-based organizations, and trusted community leaders to increase access to crucial resources and legal assistance. Law students volunteered to support pro bono and legal services attorneys by identifying families facing eviction, conducting intake and research, and drafting motions. Clinics partnered with courts to create eviction diversion programs, eviction defense walk in clinics, and “lawyer and law student of the day” programs. In communities across the country, law students hosted pop up clinics, help-a-thons, ERA application workshops, and canvassed in high risk communities to ensure tenants had access to justice and increased housing stability.</p>



<p><strong><u>APPENDIX A</u></strong><br><strong><em>Examples of Law School Responses to the Attorney General’s Call to Action to the Legal Profession<br></em></strong><br><strong>Rutgers University Law School: </strong><em>Dedicated $2 Million in State Funding to Establish Cross-Campus and Statewide Anti-Eviction Initiative to Address the Crisis.</em> Across campuses, Rutgers University Law School dedicated $2 million in state funding to increase the school’s ability to ramp up eviction prevention efforts. The Law School hired multiple new housing attorneys to represent clients and supervise students in eviction defense work. Students served over 350 households and dedicated over 3,700 hours to increasing housing stability in the community in the fall 2021 semester alone.</p>



<p>On the Newark campus, students faced the challenge of finding tenants. The courthouse, where tenants typically connect with law students and attorneys, had been closed since March 2020, leaving tenants to navigate online evictions without assistance. Associate Professor of Law Norrinda Brown Hayat established a Housing and Tenant Solidarity Clinic with the goal of making tenants aware of pending cases, ERA, and counsel. Students conducted file review to identify pending evictions and provided legal and ERA application assistance to tenants with upcoming hearings. Students also launched the Stop Evicting Newark: Know Your Rights Campaign, in partnership with Newark Water Coalition. Every week, law students participated in clean water and food distributions to offer on the spot assistance with ERA applications and legal representation. Students engaged with over 200 community members in high risk communities each week. In addition, students created short, multi-lingual informational videos that were amplified by community groups and through social media to maximize visibility of ERA and available legal assistance. The law school’s Camden campus developed a Housing Justice Clinic aimed at increasing eviction defense, as well as a new pro bono project to connect tenants with rental assistance and help them apply for dismissal of their eviction case.</p>



<p><strong>New York University School of Law, in Partnership with Fordham University School of Law: </strong><em><u>Launched the New York City Housing Justice Initiative to Train Over 80 Law Students to Increase Access to Emergency Rental Assistance.</u></em> Within two days of the Attorney General’s Call to Action, Professors Sateesh Nori and Julia McNally of New York University’s (NYU) Housing Law Clinic, gathered nearly 100 clinical and pro bono law school programs to expand law schools’ contributions to eviction prevention in their communities. The NYU Housing Law Clinic partnered with Fordham University School of Law and the New York Legal Aid Society to launch the Housing Justice Initiative and train over 80 law students across the city to assist tenants at risk of eviction in applying for ERA. Students in NYU’s Housing Law Clinic also provided legal assistance to prevent evictions and improve housing conditions. In just the fall semester, students helped nearly 60 families stay housed and are continuing their efforts this spring. For the students the opportunity to help a family stay safely housed is transformational. “Working with tenants and vulnerable populations to provide assistance can really help shape students&#8217; sense of themselves as public interest lawyers and their sense of having a future in public interest law,” McNally <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/law-schools-are-answering-justice-departments-call-eviction-help-2021-09-02/">said</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Wayne State University School of Law: </strong><em><u>Filling the Justice Gap in Detroit in Partnership with Legal Services.</u> </em>When the Attorney General issued the Call to Action, it struck close to home for the Wayne State University School of Law. Located in Detroit, the eviction crisis was dire and the end of the eviction moratorium meant widespread homelessness and displacement. Dean Richard Bierschbach gathered the pro bono, experiential, and clinical faculty to immediately launch the Warrior Eviction Defense Corps, a partnership with the City of Detroit, United Community Housing Coalition, and Lakeshore Legal Aid, with the goal of providing legal representation to the thousands of tenants facing eviction. Under the supervision of experienced attorneys, students in the Corps staff eviction dockets, conduct client intake, draft pleadings and settlement documents, and negotiate conditional dismissals on behalf of tenants. Thanks to a statewide eviction diversion order issued by Michigan Supreme Court Chief Justice Bridget McCormick, students can help tenants pause their eviction proceeding in order to access the ERA program. Students also participate in direct tenant outreach to support the work of Detroit’s Eviction Prevention Team. This spring, the Corps plans to add a court watch project and legal research to support a right to counsel program in Detroit.</p>



<p>Pro bono students participating in University of Michigan School of Law’s COVID-19 Corps team also partnered with Lakeshore Legal Aid to meet the growing demand for legal assistance. As Maiya Moncino, the group’s law student founder <a href="https://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/2020/05/university-of-michigan-law-students-offer-free-legal-help-during-coronavirus-pandemic.html">said</a>, “Medical staff are on the front lines, but lawyers are confronting the pandemic’s shockwaves. COVID-19 has created a whole host of legal problems. We want to show up for our communities.”</p>



<p><strong>University of Nebraska College of Law: </strong><em><u>Students Fueled the Tenant Assistance Project to Increase Access to Counsel and Drastically Reduce Immediate Evictions – 98% of Represented Tenants Avoided Immediate Eviction.</u></em> The students at Nebraska University College of Law are the first to point out the unfairness of the eviction system in the state: less than 2% of tenants have access to legal representation, state law does not require actual notice of a hearing, and—without counsel—over 80% of cases result in eviction, often on the same day as the hearing. When first creating the Tenant Assistance Project, which grew significantly thanks to the Attorney General’s Call to Action, faculty and law students wanted to ensure that every tenant facing eviction had an advocate in their corner. The Tenant Assistance Project, a partnership between the Law School and over 20 organizations, including the Nebraska State Bar Association’s Volunteer Lawyers Project and Legal Aid of Nebraska, expanded from a small group of dedicated volunteers to a community of students engaged with a statewide effort to prevent the eviction crisis, thanks to the Attorney General’s Call. Law students are taking a multi-prong strategy to assist over 400 households over the last five months that includes: conducting file review to identify at risk tenants, making direct contact with every household with a pending eviction hearing to offer them ERA application assistance and legal representation, preparing eviction defense packets for pro bono attorneys in every case, and engaging in courthouse advocacy on the day of hearings. As a result of the program, 98% of represented tenants avoided immediate orders of eviction.</p>



<p><strong>Atlanta Area Law Schools</strong>: <em><u>Over 300 Law Students from Atlanta Area Law Schools Provided Pro Bono Support to Attorneys Statewide.</u></em> Just as the Attorney General issued the Call to Action, legal nonprofits across the state of Georgia were seeing a spike in low-income families facing housing instability. Law schools in the Atlanta region answered the Attorney General’s Call to Action by providing the pro bono support necessary to meet the need. John Marshall School of Law first asked for “pro bono heroes” to answer the call by participating in a help-a-thon with Georgia Free Legal Answers. In addition, Georgia State University and John Marshall law students collaborated with Georgia Legal Services Program, Atlanta Volunteer Lawyers Foundation, and Atlanta Legal Aid Society to staff an emergency situation intake project, provide ERA application support, and support pro bono attorneys with eviction defense cases. Law students were able to inform vulnerable renters of their rights, screen for ERA eligibility, and connect them to pro bono or legal aid attorneys. Pro bono volunteers and law students working with Georgia Legal Services Program assisted over 350 tenants and obtained more than $2.5 million for clients in need across 100 cities in Georgia. With Atlanta Volunteer Lawyers Foundation, they conducted outreach to an additional 1,000 households.</p>



<p><strong>Wake Forest University School of Law: </strong><em><u>64 Students Dedicated over 820 Hours to Partner with Medical Providers and Connect Families in Need with ERA.</u></em> When the Attorney General issued the Call to Action, Dean Jane Aiken quickly mobilized the school’s pro bono program and the medical-legal partnership clinic, a collaboration with Wake Forest School of Medicine, the Downtown Health Plaza, and Legal Aid of North Carolina, to respond to the urgent eviction crisis. To Professor Allyson Gold, the director of the clinic, it was clear that ERA would be the most direct and fastest way to protect tenants from the imminent threat of eviction. The clinic partnered with the county’s ERA program to ramp up the visibility and accessibility of the program in the highest risk communities. Students created dual language flyers and posters, canvassed in the community, and hosted multiple community-based workshops to assist tenants with their applications. Between direct outreach and representation, 64 students dedicated 820 hours to serve 110 households. “This would not have been possible without ERA’s unprecedented funding,” said Katie Merlin, a third-year law student who helped organize the school’s response. “We believe access to the American Rescue Plan’s ERA program is the reason that eviction rates are at historic lows in our community.” Law, medical and undergraduate students also collaborated to train Downtown Health Plaza medical providers who serve low-income patients to screen for eviction risk and to refer them for ERA and legal assistance. Pro bono students collaborated with Legal Aid of North Carolina to develop know your rights flyers and a housing law manual for tenants and pro bono attorneys.</p>



<p><strong>Washington, D.C. Area Schools, Led by Georgetown University Law Center: </strong><em><u>Launched Community-Based Clinics and Partnered with Medical Providers to Reach Those In Need of Assistance</u><strong>. </strong></em>Georgetown University Law Center was among the first to answer the Attorney General’s Call to address the eviction crisis and protect the many Washington, D.C. residents in danger of losing their homes. Students from Georgetown University Law Center, along with students from George Washington University and American University Washington College of Law, assisted tenants with ERA applications at pop-up clinics hosted by the D.C. Office of the Attorney General. The effort prevented over two dozen scheduled evictions immediately following the Attorney General’s Call. In addition, Georgetown’s Health Justice Alliance, a collaboration between Georgetown Law and Georgetown University Medical Center, expanded its work to increase legal representation of tenants and provide medical partners with trainings and materials necessary to help patients understand their rights, access ERA, and avoid eviction. Students also distributed information about ERA and eviction prevention to 500 families in the District’s lowest-income schools and conducted “public benefits” check-ups for all clients to increase financial assistance.</p>



<p><strong>Duke University School of Law: </strong><em><u>50 Student Volunteers Established a Court-Based Eviction Prevention Legal Clinic to Ensure Legal Representation to Over 100 Individuals.</u></em> In Durham, North Carolina, the pandemic exacerbated what Duke Law faculty describe as a longtime eviction crisis. Clinic Director Charles Holton, Professor Jesse Hamilton McCoy II, and student coordinator Amanda Joos recognized the immense and immediate need and launched the Eviction Advice Clinic at the Durham County Courthouse. With over 50 student volunteers, they have been able to staff the clinic every week since the Call to Action and provide on the spot legal advice, representation, and assistance with ERA applications. In five months, the students represented approximately 100 individuals who would have otherwise been unrepresented and left to navigate the eviction system under the looming threat of displacement.</p>



<p><strong>Boston University School of Law: </strong><em><u>Leveraging Technology to Increase Tenant Access to Justice</u></em>.&nbsp; As a leader in social justice and civil rights law, Boston University (BU) Law Dean, Angela Onwauchi-Willig recognizes that “Few things are more disruptive and destructive to a person’s life than eviction. You lose your home, your community, your stability—basically, with an eviction, you lose all that you have known, all at once.” So, she did not hesitate to heed the Attorney General’s Call to Action to close the justice gap through the school’s clinical work. In Boston, throughout the pandemic, traditional methods for accessing legal representation were often unavailable due to court and help desk closures and pandemic mitigation protocols. To ensure tenants had meaningful access to assistance, BU Law leveraged technological platforms and launched a pro bono service project using the <a href="https://www.gbls.org/MADE">MA Defense for Eviction Portal</a>, an online portal created by Quinten Steenhuis and available through Greater Boston Legal Services to help tenants respond to eviction actions. The portal connects trained law students and translators with tenants who need assistance drafting and filing legal pleadings within a short window to avoid immediate evictions. BU Law Clinical Instructor Jade Brown <a href="https://www.bu.edu/law/record/articles/2021/eviction-crisis/">reflected</a>, “I really felt we could reach a large number of people. I know, having worked in legal services, just how overwhelmed the system is and how overwhelmed we were.”<br><strong><u>APPENDIX B</u></strong><br><br><strong><em>Statement of Law School Deans in Support of the Attorney General’s Call to the Legal Community</em></strong><br><strong><em>August 30, 2021</em></strong></p>



<p>We, the deans of law schools across the United States, agree with Attorney General Garland that the legal profession is well positioned to provide support for tenants, landlords, and courts in the looming housing and eviction crisis. As law school deans responsible for training the next generation of lawyers to be stewards of an effective, equitable, and just legal system, we feel obliged to do our part. Therefore, we are working with our faculty and students to take immediate and meaningful action to combat this crisis. Drawing on resources such as our pro bono programs, clinical offerings, and the service of our larger law school communities, we will help ensure that families and individuals facing eviction have the legal representation, counseling, and assistance they need to exercise their rights, that those entitled to the support of the Emergency Rental Assistance Program are able to access it, and that eviction proceedings are conducted in a fair and just manner.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>East Room</em></p>



<p>2:29 P.M. EST&nbsp;THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Thank you, Dr. Biden.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Please have a seat, everybody.</p>



<p>Well, good afternoon, everyone.&nbsp; Good afternoon.&nbsp; It is so good to meet so many folks and to see so many folks.&nbsp; It’s nice to be together, under one roof together, isn’t it?</p>



<p>And, of course, it is an honor to be here with our incredible President, Joe Biden &#8212; (applause); First Lady Dr. Jill Biden &#8212; (applause); and the first Second Gentleman of the United States, my husband, Doug Emhoff.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>It is wonderful to be here this afternoon, joined by the members &#8212; the most esteemed members of the Congressional Black Caucus.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; And as a former member of the CBC, I know firsthand that the members of the CBC are truly the conscience not only of the Congress but of our country.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>Thank you, also, to all the clergy joining us today, who continue to lift the spirits and the condition of so many people in our country.&nbsp; And to the community organizers, who work day in and day out to make a difference in the lives of all people in our nation.&nbsp; We are so grateful for you.</p>



<p>And we are gathered, then, at a critical moment in the history of our nation and our world &#8212; a moment in which our democratic principles have come under threat.<br><br>Today, the eyes of the world are on Ukraine and the brave people who are fighting to protect their country and their democracy.&nbsp; And their bravery is a reminder &#8212; a most recent reminder &#8212; that justice, equality, and freedom must never be taken for granted by any of us.<br><br>So, friends, Black History Month was established to teach the history that too often has not been taught: the history of Black excellence and leadership in America &#8212; (applause) &#8212; and also the history of resistance and resilience in America.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>And we are clear: Black history is American history.&nbsp; It is living, breathing history &#8212; history we create every day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And today, of course, our nation faces many great challenges.&nbsp; Among the greatest is the assault on the freedom to vote &#8212; the freedom from which all others flow.&nbsp;<br><br>It will take an all-hands-on-deck approach to safeguard and strengthen the freedom to vote.&nbsp; And the President and I are committed to securing that freedom, as is everyone here.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>And that is why I felt such pride and such hope &#8212; understanding how votes lead to action through elections, it is why I felt such pride and such hope this past Friday when President Joe Biden nominated Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson &#8212; (applause) &#8212; when he nominated her to sit on the United States Supreme Court.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>Because, as we all know, elections matter.&nbsp; And when folks vote, they order what they want.&nbsp; And in this case, they got what they asked for.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>I went off script a little bit.&nbsp; (Laughter.)</p>



<p>And Judge Jackson, of course, will make a phenomenal Justice.&nbsp; She is brilliant.&nbsp; She has a brilliant mind and a record of excellence &#8212; a record that proves she will administer equal justice.&nbsp; And I don’t have to tell everybody here, she has been confirmed on a bipartisan basis three times and deserves, therefore, a swift confirmation now.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>And Judge Jackson will be the first Black woman to sit on our nation&#8217;s highest court.&nbsp; And as Dr. Jill Biden mentioned, it is with that spirit also that we know she will not be the last.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br><br>So, there is a lot to celebrate.&nbsp; There is a lot to look forward to.&nbsp; There is a lot to work toward.&nbsp; And in remembering our history, we remember those great American heroes who continue to inspire and motivate us, who continue to remind us through our memory of them and their contribution and sacrifice what our role and responsibility is at this moment in history.<br><br>And speaking of that, then, when everyone walked in to the White House today, I&#8217;m sure that you may have seen an exhibit celebrating great Black Americans.<br><br>On display is a campaign poster from Shirley Chisholm &#8212; Barbara Lee, I saw you here today &#8212; books by Toni Morrison, Zora Neale Hurston, and Maya Angelou; and a display honoring Dr. Mae Jemison, who I just talked with last week &#8212; you know I’m the head of the Space Council &#8212; (laughter) &#8212; about her life and her work and her enduring commitment to helping young people find their own path to the stars.<br><br>In the exhibit, there is also an Ella Fitzgerald vinyl &#8212; we used to call it an &#8220;album&#8221;; and a Jacob Lawrence painting, which hangs right here in this White House on a permanent basis; and, especially significant in this moment, a judicial oath signed by Justice Thurgood Marshall, whose life&#8217;s work influenced my own.&nbsp; In fact, his portrait hangs currently in the official office of the Vice President of the United States.&nbsp; And &#8212; (applause) &#8212; and a bust of his figure sits in my ceremonial office as well.<br><br>So, as we gather here today, and as we prepare to confirm<br>another historic first to our nation&#8217;s highest court, let us always remember: We stand on the shoulders of giants &#8212; giants in our history, giants in American history, and giants right here in this room.&nbsp;<br><br>This Black History Month, let us recommit to honoring<br>their legacy with action.&nbsp; Let us continue their fight and our fight for justice and equality and opportunity for all so that generations to come may stand on our shoulders and reach even greater heights.<br><br>And history, as I have said many times before, I do believe it to be a relay race.&nbsp; We have been each passed a baton with which we run our part in our pursuit of progress and we will then pass the baton to the next generation.&nbsp;<br><br>And in that spirit, it is now my pleasure to introduce a young, brilliant leader who is leading our nation forward with bravery, creativity, and grace, and excellence.<br><br>Please welcome Cateo Hilton.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br><br>END&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2:38 P.M. EST</p>

<p>Jill and I were saddened to learn of the passing of Dick Blum, a successful businessman, humanitarian, and proud son of California who dedicated much of his public life to fighting poverty around the globe.</p>



<p>For 16 years, I had the honor of serving on the Senate Judiciary Committee alongside Dick’s wife — and one of America’s true trailblazers — Senator Dianne Feinstein. During that time, Jill and I came to know Dick as a friend. He was first and foremost dedicated to his family. He turned his lifelong fascination with Mt. Everest into the American Himalayan Foundation, which he created to help construct schools and hospitals in the Tibetan community. And here at home, Dick bled Berkeley blue — he was fiercely loyal to his alma mater, the University of California, where he established the Blum Center for Developing Economies to seek innovative solutions to the challenges of global poverty.</p>



<p>Above and beyond his many professional and philanthropic accomplishments, Dick was a man of personal decency and generosity — a champion of human rights, driven by genuine care and compassion to make a difference in the world. From his home state to halfway around the globe, his legacy will live on in the families and communities his goodness touched.</p>



<p>Jill and I will miss our friend. Our prayers are with Senator Feinstein, their family, and all those who knew and loved Dick Blum.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>From the first day in office and every day since, the Biden-Harris Administration has taken an historic approach to advancing racial equity, including directing every agency across the whole of the federal government to address the lasting impacts of systemic racism on Black communities. For generations, entrenched disparities in our society and economy, at times facilitated by the federal government, have made it harder for Black Americans to have a fair shot at the American dream. Centuries of injustice and decades of disinvestment in Black communities not only undermine the American promise of equal opportunity, but also keep our entire nation from reaching its potential.</p>



<p>After just one year in office, the Administration has delivered real and lasting change and continues to work each day to deliver equitable outcomes and opportunity for Black Americans.</p>



<p><strong>Economic Opportunity for Black Families and Communities.</strong> By signing into law the historic American Rescue Plan (ARP) and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and implementing robust regulatory reform, President Biden has helped create new economic opportunities for Black Americans and made long overdue investments in Black communities. These transformative policies and programs include:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Providing Immediate Relief to Black People and Families through the American Rescue Plan.</strong> The <a href="https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&amp;id=5f43ffef0d&amp;e=cf669202c8">ARP</a> provided cash relief directly to low- and middle-income Americans last year, and cut Black child poverty by <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/610831a16c95260dbd68934a/t/61ea09926280d03df62aa31d/1642727841927/Monthly-poverty-December-2021-CPSP.pdf">33.3</a>%, lifting more than 1 million Black children out of poverty in December 2021 alone. The President’s plans call for extending this critical tax cut, which expired in December.  In addition, the ARP increased Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits by 15% through September 2021. Beginning on October 1, 2021, USDA&#8217;s Thrifty Food Plan update increased SNAP benefits by $36.30 per person per month.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Reversing Decades of Disinvestment Through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.</strong> For years, politicians have talked about investing in our national infrastructure, but up until now they have failed to follow through. The lack of investment has fallen most heavily on Black and other communities of color. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will replace lead pipes, increase access to good-paying jobs, expand affordable high-speed internet, reliable public transit, clean drinking water, reconnect Black neighborhoods divided by legacy highway infrastructure and other resources to finally give Black communities a fair shot at the American Dream.</li></ul>



<ul><li>The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law permanently authorizes the Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA) for the first time since its inception and elevates the agency head to the position of Under Secretary, granting the agency expanded power to support Black and other minority-owned businesses. The President’s plans would supercharge MBDA by funding it at $1.6 billion through 2029.<ul><li>EPA announced that it will allocate <a href="https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&amp;id=f840c7c7b9&amp;e=cf669202c8">$2.9 billion</a> in Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding to states, Tribes, and territories for lead service line replacement in 2022. The 2022 allocation is the first of five years of nearly $15 billion in dedicated EPA funding for lead service lines that states will receive through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. EPA will encourage states to use these funds to advance proactive lead line replacement programs with a particular focus on disadvantaged communities. Moving forward, EPA will prioritize communities with the highest lead levels and those with environmental justice concerns.</li></ul><ul><li>The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law delivers the largest investment in tackling legacy pollution in American history by cleaning up Superfund and brownfield sites, reclaiming abandoned mine land, and capping orphaned oil and gas wells. More than one in four Black Americans live within 3 miles of a <a href="https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&amp;id=406ac95a00&amp;e=cf669202c8">Superfund site</a>– a higher percentage than for Americans overall. No community deserves to have contamination near where they live, work, play, pray, and go to school.</li></ul></li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Leveraging Federal Procurement to Narrow the Racial Wealth Gap for Black Entrepreneurs and Families.</strong> Recognizing that the federal government spends more than $650 billion each year on purchasing goods and services, President Biden has directed agencies to use federal purchasing power to grow federal contracting with underserved small businesses. He has set a goal of increasing the share of federal contracting dollars to small disadvantaged businesses by 50% by 2025— projected to translate to an additional $100 billion to minority-owned businesses, and helping more Americans realize their entrepreneurial dreams. In December 2021, The Administration further <a href="https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&amp;id=3914654cd1&amp;e=cf669202c8">announced</a> reforms to the federal procurement process to help meet the President’s ambitious target and deliver new opportunities for Black owned and other small disadvantaged businesses.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Extending a Lifeline to Struggling Small Businesses.</strong> The American Rescue Plan provided emergency grants, lending, and investment to hard-hit small businesses – including Black businesses – so they can rehire and retain workers and purchase the health and sanitation equipment they need to keep workers safe. This includes the new $10 billion State Small Business Credit Initiative, which will provide growth capital to early stage companies and main street small businesses in economically disadvantaged areas, including minority-owned businesses.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Ensuring Black Homeowners Get Full Value for their Homes.</strong> In June 2021, President Biden directed the launch of a first-of-its-kind interagency effort to address inequity in home appraisals and conduct rulemaking to aggressively combat housing discrimination. The effort, led by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Marcia Fudge and Domestic Policy Advisor Susan Rice, is developing a set of policy actions and recommendations for President Biden to redress racial bias in home appraisals that will soon be released.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Protecting Black Americans’ Access to Housing by Combating Housing Discrimination.</strong> Following President Biden’s Presidential Memorandum directing his Administration to address racial discrimination in the housing market, HUD published an interim final rule in the Federal Register entitled “Restoring Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing Definitions and Certifications” that requires HUD funding recipients to complete an assessment of fair housing issues, identify fair housing priorities and goals, and then commit to meaningful actions to meet those goals and remedy identified issues.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Helping Black Americans Stay in their Homes.</strong> President Biden’s American Rescue Plan has helped millions of Americans, including Black Americans, stay in their homes by providing emergency rental assistance. Of the $25 billion in rental assistance that was spent in 2021, Black Americans represented more than 40% of aid recipients. In addition, the ARP is helping struggling homeowners catch up with their mortgage payments and utility costs through the Homeowner Assistance Fund. And, it provided additional funding for families and individuals who are recovering from or at risk of homelessness.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Assisting Black Land Owners in Resolving Title Issues. </strong>An estimated 60% of Black-owned land in the South is heirs’ property—property that passes through inheritance without a will and that, as a result, has historically rendered owners ineligible for U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) programs, including lending. In July 2021, the USDA rolled out the Heirs’ Property Relending Program, which primarily aids underserved communities, including Black Americans. The new program provides funds to assist heirs in resolving ownership and succession issues on farmland with multiple owners.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Dismantling Barriers to Accessing USDA Programs and Services.</strong> The ARP provides funding for USDA to establish one or more equity commissions to address historical discrimination and disparities in the agricultural sector. In February 2022, USDA announced the membership of its 15-member Equity Commission Advisory Committee and Equity Commission Subcommittee on Agriculture. The Equity Commission Advisory Committee will advise the Secretary of Agriculture by identifying USDA programs, policies, systems, structures, and practices that contribute to barriers to inclusion or access, systemic discrimination, or exacerbate or perpetuate racial, economic, health and social disparities.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Reducing Barriers for Black Communities Facing Natural Disasters. </strong>In <a href="https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&amp;id=acd8fa07ee&amp;e=cf669202c8">September</a> 2021, FEMA implemented policy changes to reduce barriers that contributed to disparities experienced by Black Americans through programs that provide individual assistance to disaster survivors. These included changes to FEMA policies to make it easier for people living on heirs’ property – which is estimated to be the majority of Black-owned land in the South – to apply for disaster aid.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Ensuring that Federal Grants Don’t Support Discriminatory Activities.</strong> In June 2021, the Department of Transportation (DOT) <a href="https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&amp;id=b916425fbf&amp;e=cf669202c8">issued an Order</a> requiring its offices to review the potential discriminatory impact of grantees’ proposed activities before awarding federal funds. Under the Order, the agency won’t award federal financial assistance unless and until the agency determines that the activities will not be discriminatory in intent or effect. Similarly, in September 2021, the Department of Justice (DOJ) began a review of its grantmaking programs, to ensure that federal funds are not distributed to agencies that engage in racial discrimination in violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Improving the Customer Experience and Service Delivery. </strong>In December, President Biden signed the Transforming Federal Customer Experience and Service Delivery to Rebuild Trust in Government <a href="https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&amp;id=6c2917d192&amp;e=cf669202c8">Executive Order</a> – a commitment from federal agencies to remove red tape on critical government services like claiming retirement benefits or filing taxes and streamline and increase access to these services for all Americans.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Reducing Child Care Cost for Black Families. </strong>The American Rescue Plan secured a $39 billion lifeline to help child care providers stay open and compensate early childhood educators, disproportionately Black Americans, as they provide safe and healthy environments for children and help parents work. Black families are nearly two times more likely than white parents to have to quit, turn down, or make a major change in their job due to child care disruptions. The pandemic exacerbated child care disruptions, and by March 2021, had already led to 9% of child care providers closing. The ARP also included an expansion of the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit; a median income family with two kids under age 13 will receive up to $8,000 towards their child care expenses when they file taxes for 2021, compared with a maximum of $1,200 previously.</li><li><strong>Advancing Equitable Employment Outcomes and Boosting Wages for Black Federal Workers. </strong>In June, President Biden signed an Executive Order on Advancing Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (DEIA) in the Federal Workforce. This Executive Order launched a whole-of-government initiative to cultivate a federal workforce that draws from the full diversity of the Nation and that advances equitable employment opportunities for workers from underserved communities. Further, in 2021 the President signed a series of executive actions leading to a $15 minimum wage for employees of federal contractors and federal employees. These actions will ensure that all federal workers, including Black federal workers, have fair access to federal employment opportunities, and will also represent a step towards addressing longstanding wage disparities.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Ensuring Equitable Educational Opportunity in K-12 Schools and an Education Beyond High School. </strong>As we continue to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, President Biden has delivered the support necessary to enable every school to <a href="https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&amp;id=85fcff5ad8&amp;e=cf669202c8">safely reopen</a> for full-time, in-person instruction; accelerate academic achievement; address the mental health needs of students; and build school communities where all students feel they belong. At the same time, President Biden has worked to ensure equitable access to high-quality education for Black students. These policies and programs include:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Historic Investments to Safely Reopen Schools and Address the Needs of Students. </strong>The ARP provided $130 billion to help elementary and secondary schools safely reopen and address the academic, social and emotional and mental health needs of all students, with funding set-aside to address the needs of students disproportionately impacted by the pandemic, including Black students. The Administration’s efforts to encourage all schools to adopt the CDC&#8217;s recommendations on masking, vaccinations, and other COVID-19 protocols, have been particularly critical to the safe reopening of schools in Black communities hit hard by COVID-19. In addition to funding the implementation of COVID-19 protocols, these funds are being used to hire counselors and social workers, provide tutors, establish and expand summer and after-school programming, and provide a wide range of supports that address the needs of Black students. It also provided funds to every Head Start grantee, which disproportionately serve Black children and families, so that grantees could safely open safely for in-person services and support children and families through the pandemic.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Protecting Students from Funding Cuts.</strong> The ARP’s Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief program includes a first of its kind maintenance of equity requirement to ensure that high-poverty school districts and schools are protected in the event of future funding cuts. The Department of Education has provided resources and technical assistance to states and school districts as they implement this new requirement, which will ensure that school districts and schools serving a large share of students from low-income backgrounds will not experience disproportionate cuts, and that school districts with the highest poverty levels do not experience any decrease in state per-pupil funding below their pre-pandemic level.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Historic Support for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs).</strong> The Biden-Harris Administration has delivered an historic $5.8 billion cumulative investment in and support for HBCUs, including:</li></ul>



<ul><li>The ARP and other pandemic relief programs have provided approximately $3.7 billion to HBCUs since President Biden took office.<ul><li>Additionally, in April, the Department of Education provided approximately $1.6 billion in debt relief to 45 HBCUs, including 13 public institutions and 32 private institutions.</li></ul><ul><li>In July and August, the Department of Education awarded more than $500 million in grant funding to HBCUs for academic capacity-building and fiscal stability.</li></ul><ul><li>President Biden signed an <a href="https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&amp;id=9bb56d7abd&amp;e=cf669202c8">Executive Order</a> establishing the White House Initiative on Advancing Educational Equity, Opportunity, and Excellence through HBCUs, which will create a government-wide approach to support the needs of HBCUs and the communities they serve and eliminate systemic barriers impeding HBCU participation in Federal programs, and in February 2022, appointed Dietra Trent, former Virginia Deputy Secretary of Education, as the Initiative’s Executive Director.</li></ul><ul><li>During HBCU week, President Biden named Tony Allen, President of Delaware State University, as Chair of the President’s Board of Advisors on HBCUs. The President has also named Glenda Glover, President of Tennessee State University as Vice Chair of the Board. The Board, established by the Carter Administration, is meant to advance the goals of the HBCU Initiative.</li></ul></li></ul>



<p><strong>Improving Health Outcomes for Black Communities.</strong> Facing a once-in a century pandemic that highlighted and exacerbated pre-existing racial disparities in our health care system, President Biden took swift action to promote better health access and outcomes for Black families. The ARP lowered health care costs for millions of lower- and middle-income Black families and invested billions to promote equitable vaccine distribution and provide critical supplies to stop the spread of COVID-19. These policies and programs include:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Lowering Health Care Costs.</strong> Millions of lower- and middle-income Black families enrolled in health insurance marketplaces saw their premiums lowered or eliminated as a result of the ARP and will continue to benefit through the end of 2022. <a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/documents/08307d793263d5069fdd6504385e22f8/black-americans-coverages-access-ib.pdf">Thanks to the ARP</a>, 76% of uninsured Black Americans could find a plan for less than $50 a month, and 66% could find a plan for free a month in 2021 with those subsidies. In addition, millions of uninsured Americans gained coverage during the Administration’s 2021 Special Enrollment Period (SEP). Of those newly signing up for HealthCare.gov coverage who attested to race or ethnicity, <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/2021-sep-final-enrollment-report.pdf">15%</a> were Black Americans, up over 60% from 2019.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Improving Black Maternal Health.</strong> The Administration is also committed to improving maternal health outcomes, including addressing the unacceptably high rates of maternal mortality and morbidity that disproportionately impact Black mothers and families. The President’s FY 22 budget request includes more than $200 million to bolster Maternal Mortality Review Committees, implement implicit bias training for health care providers, and create State pregnancy medical home programs, among other actions. It also includes $6 billion for the critical Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program to help vulnerable families put healthy food on the table and address racial disparities in maternal and child health outcomes.<ul><li>The President’s plans includes a historic $3 billion investment in maternal health focused on growing and diversifying the perinatal workforce, improving data collection and maternal health risk monitoring, addressing the social factors that contribute to poor maternal health outcomes, addressing substance use disorders that impact maternal health, promoting increased maternal health research, improving postpartum coverage, and better coordinating care. This includes sparking innovation by allowing states to establish maternal health homes to better coordinate health care for individuals before, during, and following birth.</li></ul><ul><li>It would also require all states to provide continuous Medicaid coverage for 12 months postpartum, eliminating potentially deadly gaps in health insurance at a critical time for individuals. Currently, states are only required to provide coverage for 60 days postpartum, despite research showing that many deaths and complications occur more than 60 days following delivery.</li></ul><ul><li>The Administration has already approved a number of Medicaid demonstrations to expand postpartum coverage, including in Illinois, Virginia, and New Jersey; these states will provide full Medicaid benefits for 12 months postpartum (other states have expanded to six months postpartum coverage or expanded coverage to 10 months for those with substance use disorders). The ARP gives states an easier pathway to extend coverage for pregnant women from 60 days to 12 months postpartum; the Administration is working to encourage all states to take up this option so women can get the care they need to stay healthy.</li></ul><ul><li>In April 2021, President Biden issued the first ever <a href="https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&amp;id=3c9546a4cd&amp;e=cf669202c8">Presidential Proclamation on Black Maternal Health Week</a>, calling on all Americans to recognize the importance of addressing the crisis of Black maternal mortality and morbidity.</li></ul><ul><li>Further, in December 2021, Vice President Harris <a href="https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&amp;id=42a57fd1ee&amp;e=cf669202c8">issued</a> a nationwide call to action to both public and private sectors to improve health outcomes for Black mothers and their children. As part of this call to action, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services issued new guidance to help states provide 12 months (up from 60 days currently) of continuous postpartum coverage through their Medicaid programs. If every state adopted an extension — as required in the President’s plans —then the number of Americans getting coverage for a full year postpartum would roughly double, extending coverage for an estimated 720,000 people in a given year. HHS also announced plans to create a new “Birthing Friendly” hospital designation, which would be the first-ever hospital quality designation by HHS specifically focused on maternity care.</li></ul></li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Building the Pipeline of Black Health Care Providers.</strong> The Administration has made a historic $1.5 billion investment to help grow and diversify the nation’s health care workforce, and bolster equitable health care in the communities that need it most during the COVID-19 pandemic and in the years to come. This funding is supporting the National Health Service Corps, Nurse Corps, and Substance Use Disorder Treatment and Recovery programs. These programs address workforce shortages and health disparities by providing scholarship and loan repayment funding for health care students and professionals, in exchange for a service commitment in hard-hit and high-risk communities.&nbsp; With funding from the American Rescue Plan, the investment supports over 22,700 providers—the largest field strength in history for these programs and a record number of skilled doctors, dentists, nurses, and behavioral health providers committed to working in underserved communities during a moment when we need them the most. Only about 5 percent of physicians in the United States identify as Black despite the fact that Black Americans account for 12 percent of the nation’s total population; over 13 percent of physicians serving through the National Health Service Corps identify as Black.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Ensuring an Equitable Pandemic Response.</strong> Nationwide, Black people have died from COVID-19 at 1.4 times the rate of White people. The ARP provided $160 billion for the vaccines, tests, personal protective equipment, and public health workforce needed to address the spread of COVID-19, an investment that is helping to drive down racial disparities in prevention and care. Due to the ARP and the President’s other investments in equitable access to the COVID-19 vaccine, multiple studies show that the gap in COVID vaccination rates in Black Americans compared to Whites and Latinos has closed. Data as of February 2022 show that 84% of Black adults, 87% of Latinos and 85% of White adults have received at least one shot, compared to 56%, 57%, and 65%, respectively, in May 2021. Additionally:<ul><li>FEMA surged resources to vaccinate all eligible Americans, including by standing up 500 vaccine sites in underserved communities. These emergency measures have helped deliver community-based and culturally competent care. In fact, over 50% of vaccines administered at the federally-run community vaccination centers went to Black Americans and other people of color, and more than 75% of people vaccinated at Community Health Centers are people of color.</li></ul><ul><li>In January 2021, President Biden signed an <a href="https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&amp;id=03fb5b89f7&amp;e=cf669202c8">Executive Order</a> on Ensuring an Equitable Pandemic Response and Recovery, creating a COVID-19 Health Equity Task Force to provide specific recommendations to the President for mitigating the health inequities caused or exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and for preventing such inequities in the future. The Task force transmitted its final report to the White House Office of the COVID-19 Response in November 2021, including recommendations related to interpersonal stress linked to racism, addressing the behavioral health consequences of the pandemic in communities of color, and vaccine, testing, and therapeutics access and confidence. By the end of 2021, the Administration had begun action on over 80 percent of the Task Force recommendations, and remains committed to engaging these recommendations within the historic initiatives and programs built to promote and sustain equity across the federal government. Federal agencies are now developing implementation proposals related to the policies and priorities recommended by the Task Force, which will be submitted no later than March 10.</li></ul></li></ul>



<p><strong>Taking Strong Action to Reform Our Criminal Justice System.</strong> From investing in community violence interventions, to reforming law enforcement, to reducing mass incarceration practices, to supporting reentry, the Biden-Harris Administration has taken concrete actions to reform the criminal justice system and address racial disparities. These policies and programs include:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Reforming Law Enforcement Practices.</strong> In September 2021, the Department of Justice (DOJ) announced a ban on use of chokeholds and carotid restraints except where deadly force is necessary, and new restrictions on no-knock warrants—implementing reforms for federal law enforcement administratively that the President had called on Congress to enact nationwide through the George Floyd Justice in Police Act. The Department also implemented a new policy requiring federal agents to wear body cameras when executing search warrants and pre-planned arrests. These changes make real the policy reform the country must undertake to prevent tragic killings like those of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor in the future. The directives apply to all agencies overseen by the Department including the FBI, Drug Enforcement Agency, and U.S. Marshal’s Service. In September, the Department of Homeland Security announced the formation of the Law Enforcement Coordination Council (LECC)—the Department’s first unified law enforcement coordination body, chaired by the Secretary—to comprehensively review and revise its policies and training on use of force, compliance with civil rights and privacy interests, and other matters. In July 2021, the Department of the Interior created a task force to study and recommend reforms for its law enforcement agencies, including the U.S. Park Police.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Ensuring Constitutional Policing.</strong> The Department of Justice (DOJ) rescinded guidance issued in the previous Administration that curtailed the use of consent decrees, including within investigations into patterns or practices of discrimination and misconduct by police departments. Pattern and practice investigations and consent decrees are critical tools to promote constitutional policing in jurisdictions where reform is warranted. DOJ has opened four such investigations in Minneapolis, Louisville, Phoenix, and Mount Vernon, New York.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Improving Prosecutorial Guidance to Prevent Unduly Harsh Sentencing.</strong> The DOJ withdrew guidance issued in the previous Administration that required prosecutors to always charge the harshest sentences, replacing it with guidance that restored discretion to make decisions about charging, plea agreements, and advocacy at sentencing based on an individualized assessment of relevant facts.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Supporting Legislation to End Racial Disparities in Cocaine Sentencing.</strong> The President endorsed the EQUAL Act, which would eliminate the racially discriminatory crack-powder cocaine sentencing disparity and make the change fully retroactive.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Support for Community Violence Intervention (CVI) Programs.</strong> The President ordered DOJ not to renew contracts for privately-operated criminal detention facilities, covering the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) and U.S. Marshals Service (USMS). When completed, this will result in up to 14,000 people in BOP custody and 10,000 people in USMS custody being moved out of private prisons. To date, the administration has closed a total of 7 contracts, resulting in more than 4,000 people moved out of private prisons.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Support for Community Violence Intervention (CVI) Programs.</strong> Black boys and young men ages 15-34 make up 2% of the population but are 37% of homicide victims, and homicide is the leading cause of death for Black men under the age of 45. Until this Administration, however, CVI programs like violence interrupters and hospital-based programs, which are demonstrated to reduce violence by up to 60%, have been badly underfunded. Under President Biden, the Treasury Department and Education Department issued guidance stating that CVI programs are eligible uses of American Rescue Plan funds—both the $350 billion in aid to state, Tribal, and local governments and the $122 billion to school districts. The Administration pivoted 26 existing grant programs across five agencies to support CVI. And President Biden continues to seek $5 billion in dedicated funding for CVI programs. These historic funds would help curtail the epidemic of gun violence that hits Black communities hardest.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Support for Reentry of Returning Citizens.</strong> In February 2021, President Biden expanded access to Paycheck Protection Program loans by removing restrictions for entrepreneurs with certain past criminal records, bringing long overdue help to small businesses previously unable to access these funds. In June 2021, the Department of Labor awarded $85.5 million to help formerly incarcerated adults and young people in 28 communities transition out of the criminal justice system and connect with quality jobs. The President issued an Executive Order directing the Office of Personnel Management to evaluate the existence of any barriers that formerly incarcerated individuals face in accessing federal employment, and to evaluate how to expand federal employment opportunities for formerly incarcerated individuals. OPM provided its findings and a summary of actions to expand employment for this population to the President in October. Further, in September 2021 the Labor and Treasury Departments released new resources to help employers leverage tax credits and other federal programs to incentivize the hiring of formerly incarcerated persons. HUD clarified that returning citizens are eligible for the 70,000 emergency housing vouchers created by the ARP. Further, President Biden’s plans include an additional $1.6 billion of workforce development and job training funding to invest in re-entry employment efforts.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Addressing Domestic Violent Extremism.</strong> President Biden directed the U.S. government to assess the threat of domestic violent extremism in the United States. In January, Secretary of the Department of Defense (DOD) Lloyd J. Austin III ordered a DOD-wide stand down to discuss the problem of extremism in the ranks, and in April he established a countering extremism working group, directing DOD officials to review and update the definition of extremism contained in <a href="https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&amp;id=ed5a029c91&amp;e=cf669202c8">DOD Instruction 1325.06</a>, and calling on the services to update transition instructions to prevent those leaving the military from being recruited by extremist groups. In March 2021, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence released the unclassified executive summary of the comprehensive assessment acknowledging that enduring domestic violent extremism motivations stem from biases against minority populations. In April 2021, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas ordered an internal review to root out white supremacy and extremism within DHS.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Using Executive Authority to Protect Voting Rights, Democracy, and Access to Justice. </strong>These policies and programs include:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Signing Executive Order Promoting Access to Voter Registration and Voting.</strong> On the 2021 anniversary of Bloody Sunday, President Biden signed an <a href="https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&amp;id=1d4d1ebc06&amp;e=cf669202c8">Executive Order</a> to leverage the resources of the federal government to provide information about the election process and increased access to voter registration opportunities. Agencies across the federal government have <a href="https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&amp;id=87561df6a0&amp;e=cf669202c8">announced steps</a> they are taking to respond to the President’s call for an all-of-government action to enhance the ability of all eligible Americans to participate in our democracy, including the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services’ <a href="https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&amp;id=280f4a922c&amp;e=cf669202c8">recent commitment</a> to make it easier for consumers using HealthCare.gov to connect to voter registration services.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Ensuring Compliance with Voting Rights Laws.</strong> The Department of Justice has taken a variety of steps to help protect the right to vote, including doubling the number of voting rights attorneys, taking steps to ensure compliance with voting rights statutes, launching a task force to combat the increase of threats against election officials and election workers, and issuing guidance on (1) the civil and criminal statutes that apply to post-election audits, (2) methods of voting, including early voting and voting by mail, and (3) the vote-dilution protections that apply to all jurisdictions under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act as they engage in redistricting.</li></ul>



<ul><li>To expand the promise of equal justice under law, the President issued a Presidential Memorandum in May 2021 that <a href="https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&amp;id=32f2f54d32&amp;e=cf669202c8">asked</a> the Attorney General to consider expanding the Department of Justice’s access to justice work. In October 2021, the Attorney General announced the reestablishment of the Office for Access to Justice as a standalone component within the Justice Department dedicated to improving the federal government’s understanding of and capacity to address the most urgent legal needs of communities across America. The President’s May 2021 Memorandum also reinvigorated the White House Legal Aid Interagency Roundtable to prioritize and expand access to legal services and federal programs, including in the areas of criminal indigent defense, civil legal aid, and pro bono services. In September 2021, the Roundtable released its Access to Justice in the Age of COVID-19 report highlighting the urgent need to prioritize and expand access to legal services and federal programs as a result of the Covid-19 crisis.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Appointing and Confirming Black Judges.</strong> President Biden is committed to ensuring that the judiciary is filled with highly qualified individuals who bring both personal and professional diversity to the bench. Since January 2021, President Biden has nominated a total of 84 individuals for federal judgeships, 25 of whom are African American, and 13 individuals for local judgeships in Washington, D.C., 5 of whom are African American. In February, he announced his intention to nominate Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to serve as Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. Of the 48 individuals who have been confirmed to positions on federal courts, 14 are African American.</p>



<p><strong>Restoring Fairness and Humanity to Our Immigration System.</strong>&nbsp; President Biden is committed to reforming our immigration system, promoting racial equity in our immigration policies, and providing legal protections for noncitizens, including Black noncitizens who call this country home.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Extending and Redesignating Haiti and Somalia for Temporary Protected Status (TPS).</strong>&nbsp; The Administration extended legal protections to Haitian and Somalian nationals who have lived in our country for years.&nbsp; TPS is a form of immigration relief available to noncitizens in the United States who cannot return home due to dangerous conditions in their home countries; it enables those individuals to live with their families and work in our communities without fear of removal.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Restarting the Haitian Family Reunification Parole Program (HFRP).</strong> The Obama-Biden Administration created the HRFP in 2014, allowing U.S. citizens and green card holders to apply for parole on behalf of family members in Haiti who have approved immigrant visa petitions.&nbsp; The prior Administration announced the termination of this program in 2019.&nbsp; The Biden-Harris Administration restored HFRP and remains committed to helping Haitian-American families reunify in our country.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Supporting Immigration Reform Legislation.</strong>&nbsp; President Biden remains committed to passing legislation to finally reform our broken immigration system.&nbsp; These reforms would promote racial equity by providing a pathway to citizenship to millions of undocumented individuals, including Black noncitizens.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>&nbsp;The President is not done. The Biden-Harris Administration continues to advance equity and racial justice, including for Black Americans, as we build back better. These policies and programs include:</p>



<ul><li><strong>President Biden’s Proposed Plan Will Promote Investment and Economic Opportunity in Black Communities</strong>. President Biden’s plans will reverse decades of disinvestment and wealth extraction in Black communities, other communities of color and rural communities, and drive good jobs and opportunity to every corner of the country, making long needed, once-in-a-generation investments in underserved communities: The President intends to make universal preschool a reality, cut child care costs and increase access to high-quality child care, reduce housing costs and increase the supply of affordable housing, lower health care costs, improve maternal health, expand coverage to millions of low-income Americans by closing the Medicaid coverage gap, and extend the ARP’s historic child tax credit expansion. The Presidents’ plans also include a $3 billion investment focused on improving maternal health in this country.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Sustained Investment in HBCUs.</strong> President Biden’s plans seek sustained investments in HBCUs and their students. These include $10 billion to HBCUs, Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs), and minority-serving institutions (MSIs). Of that total, $2 billion is dedicated specifically for HBCUs—a five-fold increase from the amounts HBCUs typically receive annually through existing funding streams to address a wide range of needs, including student financial aid, infrastructure upgrades, and campus services. HBCUs can compete for another $4 billion of these funds to support research and development programs.<ul><li>Additionally, President Biden’s FY22 budget request for the Department of Education includes a total of $807 million in discretionary funding to HBCUs, an increase of $72 million over last year’s funding level, which will substantially increase key HBCU funding streams to support research, infrastructure, and student support services, amongst other programming.</li></ul></li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Unwavering Support for the Fundamental and Sacred Right to Vote.</strong> President Biden has firmly and repeatedly called for Congress to enact the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and the Freedom to Vote Act, which would together set national standards that make it easier to vote, and deliver new tools to prevent voting discrimination. The President urged the Senate to change the rules, including getting rid of the filibuster, to pass these critical pieces of legislation. And the President will continue to use every tool at his disposal to protect the right to vote in free, fair, and secure elections.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Transforming Public Education with Historic Funding Increases.</strong> Black students are less likely to have access to high-quality preschool, resulting in disparate outcomes before students even enter kindergarten. They are more likely to attend rundown and unsafe schools. They are taught by less experienced teachers. And they have lower college completion rates and higher student loan debt burdens than their white peers. The President has outlined a <a href="https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&amp;id=a758d3c8cb&amp;e=cf669202c8">far-reaching agenda</a> that will transform public education, advancing equity for Black students and prepare all students to succeed.</p>



<ul><li>The President’s plans would provide universal, high-quality preschool for all three- and four-year-olds; invest in school infrastructure so all students learn in safe and healthy school buildings with the technology and labs they need to prepare for the jobs of the future; and strengthen and diversity the teacher pipeline.</li></ul>



<ul><li>The President’s FY22 budget proposal includes a $20 billion increase in Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) Title I funding, which would more than double funds available under the flagship program for students in high-poverty schools, while providing meaningful incentives for states to address inequitable school funding systems and close gaps in access to rigorous coursework, like advanced math and science courses. Over 80% of Black students attend a Title I-eligible school, and there is a $23 billion annual funding gap between majority white and majority non-white school districts.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Through the President’s plans and his FY22 budget, the President has requested a $950 increase to the maximum Pell Grant for students enrolled in public and private non-profit colleges, benefitting <a href="https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&amp;id=248e202884&amp;e=cf669202c8">75% of HBCU students</a> who receive them.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Addressing Police Misconduct.</strong> The President strongly supported the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. He is disappointed that legislation has not yet reached his desk, and continues to urge Congress to act, while also examining ways to advance meaningful police reform through executive action.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>President Biden campaigned on a bold vision of tackling the climate crisis with the urgency that science demands by seizing the opportunity to build a strong domestic energy sector that can manufacture and deploy clean energy for the benefit of all Americans—with lower costs for families, good-paying jobs for workers, and healthier air and cleaner water for communities.</p>



<p>Since Day One, he has delivered. After rejoining the Paris Agreement, restoring scientific integrity, and reinvigorating U.S. leadership on the world stage, President Biden <strong>mobilized every federal agency to achieve groundbreaking goals:</strong> reducing greenhouse gas emissions 50-52% below 2005 levels in 2030, reaching 100% carbon pollution-free electricity by 2035, and delivering 40% of the benefits from federal investments in climate and clean energy to disadvantaged communities. The President formed the first-ever National Climate Task Force, bringing together Cabinet leaders to drive decisive action toward those goals.</p>



<p>Alongside historic executive actions, President Biden also <strong>made climate action and environmental justice a centerpiece of his Bipartisan Infrastructure Law</strong>—which includes the largest federal investments ever in upgrading the power grid, improving public transit and investing in zero-emission transit and school buses, installing a nationwide EV charging network, cleaning up legacy pollution, delivering clean water and replacing lead pipes, demonstrating innovative climate technologies, and increasing climate resilience to safeguard against extreme weather, which last year caused more than $145 billion in damages from the biggest 20 disasters alone.</p>



<p><strong><u>CALLING ON CONGRESS TO DELIVER</u></strong></p>



<p>President Biden knows that we need to move even faster to combat climate change—and that to meet the moment and fully seize the economic opportunity in front of us, Congress must act. <strong>In his first State of the Union address, the President will call on Congress to deliver on a legislative&nbsp;agenda for clean energy and climate action </strong>that has overwhelming support from the American people—Republicans, Democrats, and Independents.</p>



<p>Specifically, the President will lift up the benefits we can secure for American consumers, companies, and communities by enacting critical investments and tax credits for domestic clean energy manufacturing and deployment. He will also highlight how the investments and tax credits would cut energy costs for American families an average of $500 per year.</p>



<p>As part of the President’s unwavering support for climate solutions, these investments will reduce emissions, lower costs for families, create good-paying jobs for workers, and advance environmental justice.</p>



<p><strong><u>BOLD ACTIONS TWO MONTHS INTO 2022</u></strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Via Teleconference</p>



<p>7:04 A.M. EST</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MODERATOR:&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; And thanks, everyone, for joining us early this morning.&nbsp; This is a background press call to discuss an update on the Russia economic restrictive measures that we announced on Saturday with Allies and partners. &nbsp;</p>



<p>This call is on background, attributable to “senior administration officials.” And the content of this call are embargoed until 7:30 a.m. Eastern.</p>



<p>For your awareness and not for reporting, the speakers on this call are [senior administration officials].&nbsp; We&#8217;re going to take &#8212; we&#8217;re going to have some remarks at the top and then just take a few questions at the end.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So with that, I&#8217;ll turn it over to [senior administration official].</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Thanks, [senior administration official].&nbsp; Good morning, everybody.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll kick off and then hand it over to [senior administration official].</p>



<p>So we&#8217;ve been saying it as clearly as we can: This is an unjustified, unprovoked, and premeditated war of choice by Putin and that, alongside Allies and partners across the world, we would make this choice a strategic failure for Russia.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We said if Putin continued to escalate, we would escalate.&nbsp; We said all options are on the table, including the most severe sanctions ever contemplated against Russia.&nbsp; We said that as we implement these costs, we would impose them in an historic and unprecedented show of coordination with countries across the world that wish to defend the core principles that underpin peace and security.</p>



<p>And so, that&#8217;s the context in which our actions to sanction the Russian Central Bank should be seen.&nbsp; We&#8217;re doing exactly what we said we’d do.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As I&#8217;ve mentioned before, no country is sanctions-proof when we act together.&nbsp; Our sanctioning of the Russian Central Bank, which we&#8217;re taking with Germany, France, the UK, Italy, Japan, Canada, the European Union, and others &#8212; with the culmination of months for planning and preparation across our respective governments; across technical, diplomatic, and political channels, including at the highest levels.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We were ready, and that&#8217;s what allowed us to act within days, not weeks or months, of Putin’s escalation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I also want to emphasize the importance of relationships in taking this collective action.&nbsp; It takes trust and solidarity to sanction the central bank of a one and a half trillion-dollar economy, multiples larger than Iran’s or Venezuela’s.</p>



<p>We built that trust and solidarity over time in dozens of phone calls, meetings, and video conferences since November.</p>



<p>With respect to the impact this action will deliver:</p>



<p>As I mentioned, no &#8212; no country is sanctions-proof.&nbsp; Putin’s war chest of $630 billion in reserves only matters if he can use it to defend his currency, specifically by selling those reserves in exchange for buying the ruble.&nbsp; And after today&#8217;s actions, that will no longer be possible, and Fortress Russia will be exposed as a myth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Already, you&#8217;ve seen the Russian Central Bank more than doubled its policy rate this morning to 20 percent.&nbsp; That’s the highest in almost two decades.&nbsp; The ruble is in freefall, and soon you’ll see inflation spike and economic activity contract.</p>



<p>This is a vicious feedback loop that&#8217;s triggered by Putin’s own choices and accelerated by his own aggression.&nbsp; <a>It&#8217;s a very raw deal Putin is giving to the Russian people as the world disconnects Russia from the global financial system and all its benefits, but it&#8217;s exactly what we said would be the consequences of his actions.</a></p>



<p>At the same time that we&#8217;re following through on our commitment to deliver overwhelming force, I want to emphasize that we and our Allies will continue to limit the impact back home.&nbsp; And in particular, we&#8217;ll continue to scope our measures to allow for steady energy supplies to global markets &#8212; [senior administration official] will say more on this.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And lastly, I want to remind everyone that, today, we’ll also fully block the Russian Direct Investment Fund and its CEO, Kirill Dmitriev.&nbsp; This fund and its leadership are symbols of deep-seated Russian corruption and influence peddling globally.&nbsp; Some of you may know it spun off from V.E.B. &#8212; Putin’s slush fund bank that we fully blocked last week &#8212; and it&#8217;s known to be intimately connected to kleptocracy at the highest levels of the Russian government.</p>



<p>This action will also limit RDIF’s ability to leverage corrupt ties to universities and organizations in the U.S. and the West more broadly.</p>



<p>Let me stop there and turn it to [senior administration official].</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Thanks, [senior administration official].&nbsp; And thanks, all of you, for joining. I want to briefly walk through the impact of these actions and why we&#8217;re taking them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The steps we&#8217;re taking today are part of the strategy that the President asked Secretary Yellen to design in order to hold Russia accountable for an invasion in the Ukraine.</p>



<p>Our strategy, to put it simply, is to make sure that the Russian economy goes backwards as long as President Putin decides to go forward with his invasion of Ukraine.&nbsp; We&#8217;re accomplishing this objective by taking a variety of steps targeting Russia&#8217;s financial institutions, elites, and now the Russian Central Bank.</p>



<p>These are all sources of the wealth the Kremlin draws on to fund destabilizing activity.&nbsp; Today&#8217;s actions represent the most significant actions that the U.S. Treasury has taken against an economy of this size and assets of this size.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I would &#8212; I want to point out that what also makes this action significant is not just the amount of assets or the size of the country we&#8217;re targeting, but the speed at which our partners and Allies have worked with us to enact this response.</p>



<p>[Senior administration official] is right that we&#8217;ve been coordinating with these Allies since November on actions related to Russia.&nbsp; But since the beginning of President Biden&#8217;s term, we&#8217;ve been working closely with these Allies on various issues related to the international financial system, which built the trust that was necessary for us to take these actions today.</p>



<p><a>Now, a few things to note about the economic impact on Russia of today&#8217;s announcements: It&#8217;s clear that when Russia prepared for an invasion of Ukraine, they were counting on using their Central Bank assets to mitigate any economic hardship that came from sanctions.&nbsp;</a></p>



<p>Russia has hundreds of billions of dollars of assets in jurisdictions all over the world.&nbsp; And ever since the leaders made their announcement on Saturday, the Russian Central Bank has been attempting to bring those assets back to Russia or to safe havens so they can be used to support their economy and their currency.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today&#8217;s announcement to prohibit transactions with the Central Bank of Russia and the National Wealth Fund will significantly hinder their ability to do that and inhibit their access to hundreds of billions of dollars in assets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From our actions alone, they will not be able to access assets that are either in the United States or in U.S. dollars. And as you&#8217;ve seen, the EU has taken actions that prohibit Central Bank&#8217;s transactions in their jurisdiction as well, and we expect the rest of the &#8212; our G7 partners to take similar actions.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s important to note that with today&#8217;s actions, we&#8217;re also constricting Russia’s access of those they might turn to for a bailout since we&#8217;re also targeting its Ministry of Finance and its rainy-day fund, the National Wealth Fund.&nbsp; And our directive also makes clear that Russia can&#8217;t turn to other banks or companies and use them as agents to evade these prohibitions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a result of today&#8217;s coordinated announcement, Russia will experience even further economic consequences.&nbsp; They will be forced to deplete their limited domestic rainy-day fund far more quickly; experience a weakening of their currency, making funding their war of choice much more expensive; create a real squeeze on Russia&#8217;s ability to fund their priorities like invasion in Ukraine; constrict the Central Bank&#8217;s routine functions and make financing more difficult since it is locked out of using foreign reserves; and exacerbate liquidity issues.</p>



<p>As with our other actions, we&#8217;ve been calibrated and deliberate to ensure our sanctions cost maximum consequences for Russia, while mitigating harm to America and our partners.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The President made very clear to us it was critical that we target our sanctions in a way that would impose costs on Russia if they continued the invasion, while mitigating those costs on the American people, on our Allies and partners.&nbsp; And consistent with that, Treasury will issue a general license to authorize certain energy-related transactions by exempting energy-related transactions for preventing unnecessary harm for consumers and preventing spikes in prices that would only pad the pockets of President Putin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As I mentioned at the top, these are serious consequences for Russia&#8217;s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, and we wouldn&#8217;t hesitate to level more if necessary.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As I said in the beginning, our objective is to make sure that the Russian economy goes backwards if President Putin decides to continue to go forward with an invasion in Ukraine. And we have the tools to continue to do that.</p>



<p>With that, I&#8217;ll end my remarks and hand it back to our host.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Could we please queue up the directions to ask a question, please?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, good morning.&nbsp; Thank you for doing this.&nbsp; Can you confirm that basically all the assets of the Central Bank, National Wealth Fund, the Finance Ministry are essentially frozen as a result of this action?&nbsp;</p>



<p>And then can you say a word about the kind of coordination with the Allies?&nbsp; Did they move forward on this more quickly than you might have been expecting, or was this all already scripted ahead of time?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; [Senior administration official], do you want to take the first and I can &#8212; I can do the second?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Yeah, I&#8217;m happy to do that.&nbsp; So what we&#8217;re doing today in the United States is that we are prohibiting transactions with the Russian Central Bank in dollars.&nbsp; So what that means is that if a U.S. financial institution has Russian Central Bank assets, they can&#8217;t do anything with them; they are stuck in that institution.&nbsp; If an institution outside of the United States has dollars for the Russian Central Bank, they can&#8217;t do anything with them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So those funds are immobilized.&nbsp; And the reality is that like any central bank around the world, the Russian Central Bank holds a great number of their assets in dollars.&nbsp; But in addition to dollars, they&#8217;re clearly diversified and they hold assets in euros, in yens, in pound sterling. &nbsp;And because of the work that we&#8217;ve done in coordinating, it means that those assets are also immobilized and unavailable for their use.</p>



<p>But let me turn it over to [senior administration official] to talk a little bit about the work we&#8217;ve done over the course of the last several months to coordinate with our Allies and partners so we&#8217;d be in a position to take an action like the one that we&#8217;re announcing today.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Yeah, and I&#8217;ll &#8212; I&#8217;ll touch on the first question as well, because we always thought of Russia&#8217;s Central Bank reserves &#8212; its $630 billion of foreign reserves &#8212; as an insurance policy for Russia.&nbsp; And that insurance policy was meant for exactly a circumstance like this.&nbsp; In other words, if their currency was plummeting, they could use those reserves to support the ruble and to defend it.&nbsp; And so, what this &#8212; what this action does is it removes, it negates, it nullifies that insurance policy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so, we&#8217;ve been talking about taking this action for months.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve been conceiving of the circumstances in which it would get deployed, the mechanisms by which we could apply it, the coordination that will be required to give it force.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so, as we saw the events unfold last week, we sent clear signals to the world about our willingness to take the most severe actions in our toolkit, and we deployed them.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks very much for doing this.&nbsp; I just wanted to ask if you could comment on anything related to, you know, action with Belarus &#8212; any future sanctions action &#8212; and reports that they&#8217;re preparing to get involved in this conflict.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Alan &#8212; [senior administration official], I&#8217;ll just start with this one &#8212; you know, we&#8217;re watching those events very carefully.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve said if &#8212; to the extent Belarus continues to aid and abet Russia&#8217;s aggression in Ukraine, they will also face consequences.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve already rolled out some of those measures.&nbsp; Those costs will continue to ratchet much higher.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey, thanks so much.&nbsp; I&#8217;m just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the timing of this.&nbsp; You&#8217;re taking this action today.&nbsp; How quickly will it actually kick in?&nbsp; Is there any danger of Russia taking actions before these measures actually go into effect that would, you know, make these actions not as forceful and damaging to Russia?&nbsp; And how quickly do you expect that these measures will actually have an impact on the Russian economy and potentially start to change Putin&#8217;s calculus here?&nbsp; Thanks.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Let me just make this clear that these actions will be effective immediately.&nbsp; We&#8217;re talking to you now because we wanted to put these actions in place before our markets opened, because what we learned over the course of the weekend from our Allies and partners was that the Russian Central Bank was attempting to move assets and there would be a great deal of asset flight starting on Monday morning from institutions around the world.</p>



<p><a>So, we took these ac- &#8212; we&#8217;re taking these actions in a way that they will be effective immediately.&nbsp; And I think the thing &#8212; to [senior administration official’s] earlier point, the Russian government, after the actions we took in 2014 &#8212; and I was here in 2014 when we took those actions &#8212; decided that they were going to try and build a war chest to try and defend against the actions that we may take if they were to take further actions in Ukraine or elsewhere in the world.</a></p>



<p>We knew that this existed and we knew that, ultimately, one of the things that we would need to do to ensure that our sanctions would be effective is at some point take &#8212; go after that war chest.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s exactly what we&#8217;ve done today.</p>



<p>And you &#8212; you asked a question as to how soon will this be effective, and we&#8217;re seeing the effect of that today: The Russian stock market isn’t open.&nbsp; The ruble has depreciated a great deal.&nbsp; Russia is taking unprecedented actions to try and support their economy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And what I would say is that we have always thought about how we would escalate as President Putin moved forward with the invasion in Ukraine.&nbsp; And we continue to have additional steps that we could take that will continue to have an impact on the Russian economy, because as they move forward with the invasion, we&#8217;re committed to working with our Allies and partners to make sure that their economy continues to move backwards so that they have less money to fund their projections of power going forward.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; And I&#8217;ll just &#8212; I&#8217;ll just add a little bit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I mean, as [senior administration official] said perfectly right, the &#8212; these actions are immediately effective, and the impact is also immediate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You know, I think the ruble is already more than 30 percent weaker today<a>.&nbsp; The Central Bank already more than doubled its policy rate from 9 and a half percent </a>to 20 percent.&nbsp; There&#8217;s talk about Russia imposing capital controls.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That &#8212; these choices that Russia has been forced into are a reflection of the fact that inflation is now very likely to spike, purchasing power is likely to plummet, investment is likely to plummet.&nbsp; These are &#8212; this is a negative and vicious feedback loop that Putin has triggered.</p>



<p>And as to whether it affects his calculus: I mean, all we can do is make sure this is a strategic failure.&nbsp; And the evidence of this failure is becoming more clear by each moment.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, there.&nbsp; Good morning.&nbsp; Can you say how much of the $630 billion is affected by the U.S. moves?&nbsp; In particular &#8212; in other words, how much of that 630 is either, I guess, linked to U.S. companies or held in U.S. dollars?&nbsp;</p>



<p>And can I ask &#8212; on a separate but related issue on the measures with regards to SWIFT: Can you give us an update on the latest on that and, in particular, whether you&#8217;re considering adding restrictions to new banks beyond those amounts previously?&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Let me start with &#8212;</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; What I can tell you is that &#8212;</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Oh, do you want &#8212; I’ll take Central Bank, [senior administration official], and handover SWIFT to you.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Yeah, great.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Well, what we know is that the Russian Central Bank, like all central banks around the world, has their assets diversified, with hundreds of billions of dollars located outside of Russia in central banks, in financial institutions around the world.</p>



<p>After the invasion of Crimea, Russia decided to move a great deal of its assets out of the United States &#8212; but to keep them in dollars but to move them into other jurisdictions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What we&#8217;ve done today is not only preventing them from using those dollars in the United States, but preventing them from being able to use those dollars in other places, like Europe or Japan, to defend their currency and prop up their institutions.</p>



<p>And our goal was to make sure that not only would they not have access to dollars, but also not have access to other currencies that would be critical to their ability to support their economy.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why doing this in a multilateral way with our Allies and partners is so important and is so crippling for the Russian Central Bank, which is now struggling to figure out ways to continue to support its economy in the face of these sanctions.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; On the SWIFT question: We’re &#8212; we remain in close consultations with our EU partners to finalize the list of banks that will be cut off from the SWIFT system.&nbsp; There are several banks that Europe and the U.S. have fully blocked; those will be the first ones considered.</p>



<p>Just as a regulatory matter, the list of banks will get finalized by the EU because SWIFT is under Belgian authority. And so, once the list is finalized, the Europeans will issue a directive that will go to Belgium for a vote of the SWIFT Board of Directors and then the de-SWIFTing will be complete.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, guys.&nbsp; Quick question is: Is the Bank for International Settlements part of this?&nbsp; And also, is the Swiss government part of this?</p>



<p>And as a broader question: Are you worried about any kind of ripple effects for the financial system?&nbsp; The &#8212; you know, are dollar funding markets likely to come under pressure from this?&nbsp; What are some of the possible kind of ripple effects and blowbacks?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; So, Neil, let me start with the second part of your question.&nbsp; I think one of the things that we&#8217;ve been doing in addition to coordinating and collaborating with our Allies and partners is telling &#8212; is telling our regulators the actions that we&#8217;ve been contemplating.</p>



<p>Since the end of last year, the Secretary and I have been spending time with regulators, both talking to them about the actions that the President is contemplating in order to better understand some of the impacts that you just mentioned and working with our team to make sure that we scenario plan for these actions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With regard to the Bank of International Settlements and other institutions, our prohibition applies to &#8212; any U.S. dollar that exists in an institution around the world is now &#8212; cannot be transacted with the Russian Central Bank.&nbsp; That is applicable to international institutions, as well as foreign countries, as well as financial institutions &#8212; foreign financial institutions that have dollars.&nbsp; So, effective immediately as &#8212; when this directive goes out, transactions with the Russian Central Bank in dollars by anyone is prohibited.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks so much for doing the call.&nbsp; I guess this first one is for [senior administration official].&nbsp; On the carveouts, you know, including all the banks that are being sanctioned, can you share what percentage of the carveouts, particularly for energy &#8212; what percentage of those make up the overall transactions?&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, I guess, for [senior administration official]: I wanted to ask &#8212; you mentioned again &#8212; or maybe it was [senior administration official]; I apologize &#8212; that, again, it will miti- &#8212; and energy impacts will be mitigated.&nbsp; Considering, you know, the moves in Germany and just support in Europe overall, is there potential or is it being considered to take a more stronger action against Russia&#8217;s energy sector?&nbsp;</p>



<p>But first, the percentage of the carveouts if you could.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp;&nbsp; So the energy market is an important one, and it&#8217;s a place where Russia plays a major role.&nbsp; But the truth is that, for these financial institutions, that the &#8212; they are doing billions of transactions each day, many of which are not energy related.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And to be frank, the fact that it will take them time to figure out how to segregate those actions will lead to additional disruption of the Russian economy.</p>



<p>Look, while the carveout will make sure that people are able to get &#8212; to make energy payments, it&#8217;s not going to stop the &#8212; stop the impact that we&#8217;re seeing on the Russian economy.</p>



<p>Today, you&#8217;ve seen European headlines talking about the fact that there&#8217;s been a run on Sberbank, Russia’s European affiliate, which is under pressure because of deposit withdrawals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, part of what we&#8217;ve done is, when we looked at the Russian financial system, we decided to take a variety of actions against the top 10 institutions.&nbsp; We did some &#8212; we did some debt and equity blocking.&nbsp; We did some full blocking.&nbsp; And we did some dollar-clearing blocking in order to make sure that the Russian Central Bank wasn’t in a position where they could find a one solution to each one of these challenges.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And for the full-blocked institutions, they&#8217;re not able &#8212; their assets have been frozen.&nbsp; For those where dollar clearing has been blocked, we&#8217;re starting to see runs on those institutions by depositors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, in addition to the fact that we may have the energy carveout, which is providing the ability for energy to flow &#8212; energy to flow and to help mitigate some of the risks both to Europe but also to the global energy markets, the variety of actions we&#8217;ve taken are still ensuring that these &#8212; each one of these institutions are under a variety of different types of pressure, which, because of the actions we&#8217;re taking against the Central Bank today, the Central Bank is going to be unable to mitigate in a meaningful way.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; On the &#8212; on the second question, Franco: We have a &#8212; we have a collective interest in ensuring that the current supply of energy to the world remains steady, A, because we want to support the global economic recovery, but, B, because we don&#8217;t want prices to spike for the benefit of President Putin as a major energy exporter.</p>



<p>Over the long term, though &#8212; and this is important &#8212; we also have a collective interest to degrade Russia&#8217;s capacity to be a leading energy supplier over the long term.&nbsp; And over the long term, that requires critical technology inputs that allow &#8212; that would allow Russia to remain a leader in energy production.&nbsp; And there you&#8217;ve already seen some actions taken by the EU and a scenario we&#8217;re exploring actively.</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; Thanks, everybody, for joining today.&nbsp; As a reminder, this call was on background, attributable to “senior administration officials.”&nbsp; And the embargo lifts in about a minute.&nbsp; Have a good rest of your day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thank you.</p>
