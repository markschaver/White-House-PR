										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>President Joseph R. Biden Jr. met today with President His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, President of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, in a bilateral meeting during the Summit of the United States and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and Egypt, Iraq, and Jordan.</p>



<p>President Biden offered his personal condolences to President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed and all Emiratis on the loss of His Highness Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed al Nahyan. President Sheikh Mohamed thanked President Biden and the American people for their expressions of sympathy and for the visit of Vice President Kamala Harris and her delegation to Abu Dhabi in May.</p>



<p>President Biden offered his congratulations to President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed on his recent election as UAE President and conveyed an invitation for him to visit the United States later this year. The two leaders discussed a range of regional and global opportunities and challenges, which require close coordination between the United States and the United Arab Emirates as strategic partners.</p>



<p>In the realm of regional diplomacy, President Biden expressed appreciation for President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed’s personal leadership in breaking down barriers and forging diplomatic relations with Israel, as well as deepening cooperation with other countries in the region. The leaders discussed the U.S. role in helping to forge new economic, trade, and people-to-people relations among Israel, the UAE, Bahrain, and Morocco, as well as in deepening the ties among these states and Egypt and Jordan through new frameworks of cooperation.</p>



<p>In the defense realm, the two leaders affirmed their commitment to deepening the extensive security cooperation that has made both countries safer and been a major contributor to regional peace and stability. President Biden noted that the UAE is the only country in the Middle East to have deployed its military forces alongside the U.S. military in every international security coalition involving the United States since Desert Shield/Desert Storm in 1990-1991. The two leaders acknowledged the close and decades-long cooperation in their nations’ shared mission to counter terrorism and violent extremism.</p>



<p>President Biden recommitted to supporting the defense of the UAE against terrorist and other hostile acts such as the attacks targeting civilian sites in the UAE in January 2022. President Biden emphasized the centrality of the UAE as a strategic partner, and as a critical part of the security partnership among the states of the GCC, Egypt, Iraq, and Jordan. President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed confirmed that the United States is the primary security partner for the UAE, and the two leaders intend to accelerate and intensify discussions to further enhance these historic ties.</p>



<p>The leaders committed to continue the close cooperation that led to a truce in Yemen, now entering its fifteenth week. They expressed their appreciation for the effective work of the GCC, the U.S. Special Envoy, and the United Nations in achieving the truce, and committed their full efforts toward guiding the parties forward in a political process that can realize a lasting settlement to the conflict. President Biden emphasized the threats still emanating from Yemen and elsewhere and the importance of ensuring that the UAE has the best and most effective means to defend its homeland and people.</p>



<p>The leaders committed to continue to use their collective diplomatic standing to de-escalate and end conflicts elsewhere in the region. They discussed the importance of protecting the prospects of a two-state solution and of assuring that the benefits of the Abraham Accords also accrue to Palestinians. The leaders reaffirmed their support for Iraq and welcomed the landmark agreements to connect Iraq’s electricity grid to those of the GCC member states, as well as other projects further integrating Iraq into the greater region.</p>



<p>On economics, commerce, and trade relations, President Biden noted that the UAE is one of the fastest growing U.S. economic partnerships globally, the largest U.S. trading partner in the Middle East, and a significant investor in the U.S. economy. He welcomed the UAE’s economic initiatives throughout the Middle East and beyond, including its recent Free Trade Agreements signed with Israel, India, and Indonesia as well as new investments in Jordan and Egypt. The leaders tasked their teams with finding areas in which to deepen and expand commercial partnerships, as well as the negotiation of a broader strategic framework agreement between the UAE and the United States. President Biden recognized the UAE’s efforts to strengthen its policies and enforcement mechanisms in the fight against financial crimes and illicit money flows. Both leaders highlighted the extensive and enduring educational, cultural, and health partnerships between the two countries.</p>



<p>President Biden welcomed the UAE’s long-time commitment to global energy security as a reliable and responsible supplier, and recognized its leading role in advancing climate action, the energy transition and in developing clean energy technologies. President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed extended President Biden an invitation to attend the COP28 to be convened in the UAE in November 2023. Both leaders noted the important launch of the water and solar energy arrangement between Israel and Jordan with Emirati and American backing and investment as a model for future partnerships in the region. They asked their respective climate envoys, John Kerry and Sultan al-Jaber, to explore new opportunities in the climate and clean energy sphere to drive economic growth and sustainable development. They noted the UAE’s successful Dubai Expo 2020, which showcased the UAE as a convener of global events that promote sustainability, innovation, and dialogue.</p>



<p>President Biden also recognized the importance of the UAE as a force for change and global citizenship. He acknowledged the UAE’s leadership in promoting religious co-existence and challenging religious hatred through such initiatives as the Abrahamic Family House and the Hedayah Center. He expressed appreciation for the role the UAE has played in delivering thousands of tons of medical supplies to nations around the world during the COVID-19 pandemic and its response to calls for humanitarian assistance during natural disasters and conflicts around the region. The two leaders also noted the exceptional position of the UAE as a tolerant home to more than 200 nationalities and faiths coexisting in peace.</p>

<p>President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. met with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi today in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia to reaffirm their shared commitment to the U.S.-Egypt strategic partnership, consult on a broad range of global and regional security challenges, and advance the U.S.-Egypt relationship.  In celebrating the milestone of 100 years of U.S.-Egypt diplomatic relations, President Al Sisi and President Biden expressed their intention to meet again in the near future to further enhance the two countries’ multi-faceted partnership.  The two leaders renewed their commitment to the U.S.-Egypt Strategic Dialogue co-chaired by Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken and Minister of Foreign Affairs Sameh Shoukry and welcomed the continued implementation of its outcomes.<br> <br>Strengthening our shared security<br> <br>The decades-long U.S.-Egypt defense partnership remains a key pillar of regional stability.  Both Presidents affirmed the importance of this partnership, which serves the interests of both countries.  President Biden reiterated that the United States aims to continue to support Egypt in providing for its own defense, including through the continued provision of security assistance in consultation with the U.S. Congress.  Both Presidents affirmed their commitment to cooperate on counter-terrorism and welcomed the notable achievements of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS.  President Al Sisi expressed Egypt’s appreciation for military equipment and security assistance from the United States.<br> <br>Advancing economic prosperity<br> <br>Both Presidents expressed their commitment to furthering bilateral economic cooperation for the mutual benefit of the Egyptian and American people.  They decided to explore new ways to expand bilateral trade, increase private sector investments, and collaborate on clean energy and climate technology.  The leaders welcomed the recent U.S. GreenTech Mission to Egypt, the largest in history, and committed to launch the high-level Joint Economic Commission.<br> <br>The impact of the war in Ukraine<br> <br>The United States and Egypt underlined that peace, security and a multilateral, rules-based order lie at the heart of their longstanding partnership.  Recalling the March 2<sup>nd</sup> and March 24<sup>th</sup> United Nations General Assembly resolutions on Ukraine, which both voted in favor of, they reaffirmed their shared principles enshrined in the UN Charter, including the respect for international law, territorial integrity, and national sovereignty.  The two Presidents emphasized the need to refrain from the use of force, solve conflicts by peaceful means, and end violations of human rights in conflict areas.  The United States and Egypt share particular concerns over the severe global consequences that stem from the war in Ukraine, including on global supply chains and energy and commodity prices.  For example, the blockading of Black Sea ports has triggered rising food insecurity and levied significant economic pressures on Egypt. <br> <br>President Biden underscored U.S. support for the Egyptian people in responding to these challenges.  To this end, the United States commends Egypt’s consultations with the International Monetary Fund and supports the provision of additional funding to Egypt through the IMF’s Resilience and Sustainability Trust.  The United States also lends its full support to Egypt’s engagement with the World Bank to seek financing options to stabilize its economy and strengthen the well-being of Egyptian households, in particular through the Crisis Response Finance Package recently announced by the Bank.  President Biden conveyed that the United States is providing $1 billion in new assistance to address the food security situation in the Middle East, with $50 million specifically for Egypt. These funds aim to bolster food security and offset the effects of the disruption in agricultural supply chains and higher food prices due to the blocking of ports.  President Biden assured President Al Sisi that the United States will advocate for Egypt and its food security needs.<br> <br>Promoting regional stability<br> <br>The United States and Egypt are cooperating closely to mediate solutions to regional conflicts and promote peace.  The two leaders stressed that a two-state solution remains the only viable path to achieve a lasting resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and to realize a secure, prosperous, and dignified future for Israelis and Palestinians alike.  President Biden expressed support for Egypt’s vital leadership and historic role in promoting peace and an end to the conflict, thereby expanding the circle of peace between Israel and its Arab neighbors and globally, as well as preserving sustainable calm between Israelis and Palestinians. <br> <br>The two leaders underscored the need to implement United Nations Security Council resolutions 2570, 2571 (2021), reaffirming the necessity of holding presidential and parliamentary elections in tandem as soon as possible in Libya.  They emphasized the importance of the full withdrawal of all foreign forces, mercenaries, foreign fighters, and the pivotal role of the 5+5 Joint Military Committee in this regard, including the prompt development of timelines.  President Biden thanked President Al Sisi for Egypt’s role in helping to consolidate the Yemen Truce, particularly through facilitating commercial flights from Sana’a to Cairo, an important component of the UN-mediated truce arrangement.  The two Presidents committed to regular consultations to resolve regional conflicts and humanitarian crises in Syria, Lebanon, and Sudan.  Regarding the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), President Biden reiterated U.S. support for Egypt’s water security and to forging a diplomatic resolution that would achieve the interests of all parties and contribute to a more peaceful and prosperous region.  The two leaders reiterated the imperative of concluding an agreement on the filling and operation of the GERD without further delay as stipulated in the Statement of the President of the United Nations Security Council dated September 15, 2021, and in accordance with international law.<br> <br>Promoting human rights<br> <br>President Biden and President Al Sisi emphasized their mutual commitment to a constructive dialogue on human rights, which is an integral component of the strong U.S.-Egypt partnership.  They will continue to consult closely on ensuring the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms in political, civil, economic, social and cultural fields.  The two leaders reaffirmed the important role that civil society can play in these areas.<br> <br>Accelerating global efforts to tackle the climate crisis<br> <br>President Biden congratulated President Al Sisi for Egypt presiding over the 27<sup>th</sup> United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP 27) in Sharm El Sheikh in November 2022 and reaffirmed the United States’ commitment to a successful Conference.  The United States welcomes Egypt’s leadership in accelerating global ambition and action to tackle the climate crisis.  President Biden welcomed Egypt’s submission of its updated nationally determined contribution (NDC).  Both leaders emphasized their countries’ support for the Global Methane Pledge (GMP) and the new GMP Energy Pathway, which Egypt has joined with respect to the oil and gas sector.  The two leaders reaffirmed the U.S. and Egypt’s new partnership on Adaptation in Africa, which the U.S. and Egypt will co-lead, focused on delivering concrete initiatives that will improve people’s lives and help build resilience to a changing climate.  The leaders committed to convene the Joint U.S.-Egypt Climate Working Group as soon as possible.  </p>

<p>This week, Americans are reading about how Members of Congress, state and local leaders, gun violence survivors, families, and advocates joined President Biden at a White House event commemorating the passage of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act – the most significant legislation to reduce gun violence in 30 years.</p>



<p>Governors, mayors, and local leaders joined Vice President Harris, Labor Secretary Marty Walsh, American Rescue Plan Coordinator Gene Sperling, and White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs Director Julie Rodriguez for a White House American Rescue Plan Summit. Following the half-day Summit, elected officials spoke to local reports about how more than $40 billion of American Rescue Plan funds have been committed to strengthening and expanding our workforce in the states.</p>



<p>Infrastructure Coordinator Mitch Landrieu also traveled to Milwaukee, Wisconsin and spoke with local press outlets about President Biden&#8217;s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which is rebuilding infrastructure in the Badger State by improving roads and bridges, replacing lead pipes to provide clean water, expanding high speed internet, and creating millions of good-paying union jobs that don’t require a college degree.</p>



<p>And Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo led a White House Regional Press Call for reporters in Indiana, Missouri and Ohio to underscore the urgent need for Congress to pass the Bipartisan Innovation Act, which will spur American manufacturing, strengthen our supply chains, and help lower costs for families.</p>

One of the most significant bilateral instruments of its kind, the MOU represents a major U.S. political commitment to Jordan’s stability and the durability of the partnership. The MOU is designed to address Jordan’s extraordinary needs, supports King Abdullah II’s economic reform program, and ensure the long-term strength of the close partnership between the United States and Jordan.<br><br>King Abdullah II thanked the President for the United States’ friendship and continued support for Jordan.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>2:09 P.M. AST&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Well, thank you.&nbsp; It’s good to be once more together with so many vital partners and to strengthening our cooperation on the future of this consequential region of the world. &nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I’d like to thank our Saudi hosts for inviting the United States to join this summit and for their hospitality in welcoming all of us.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A great deal has changed since I visited this region when I served as Vice President of the United States, both on the world stage and in the Middle East.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Around the world, we’re seeing efforts to undermine the rules-based order: with China’s increasingly coercive actions in the Indo-Pacific and beyond; with Russia’s brutal and unprovoked war against its neighboring Ukraine; and with Iran’s destabilizing activities. &nbsp;Here in the Middle East, we’ve also seen critical changes.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the first time since 9/11, an American President is visiting this region without American troops being engaged in combat &#8212; in a combat mission in the region.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We’ll always honor the bravery, the selfishness [sic] &#8212; selflessness of the &#8212; and the sacrifices of the Americans who served, including my son, Major Beau Biden, who was stationed in Iraq for a year.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And we’ll never forget the memory of the seven thousand fifty- &#8212; 7,054 American troops who made the ultimate sacrifice while serving in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere over the last two decades.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But today, I am proud to be able to say that the era of land wars in the region &#8212; wars involving huge numbers of American forces &#8212; is not underway.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We &#8212; but we maintain both the capacity and the absolute determination to suppress the terrorist threat wherever we find it.&nbsp; We’ve demonstrated that this year &#8212; eliminating the Emir of ISIS on a daring operation, and just this week, taking out another key leader of ISIS.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We’re going to continue our counterterrorism efforts working with a broad coalition of countries, including everyone around this table.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And we will turn our attention and our resources to supporting our partners, strengthening our alliances, and building coalitions to solve the problems facing this region and the world &#8212; and the world today.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The United States is clear-eyed about the challenges in the Middle East and about where we have the greatest capacity to help drive positive outcomes.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our objectives are focused on &#8212; are &#8212; excuse me, are focused, realistic, and achievable so that we can target our resources, rebuild trust, and deliver real results.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And we will operate in the context of the Middle East as it is today: a region more united than it has been in years.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The GCC is a prime example of that.&nbsp; Former rivals have<br>reestablished diplomatic and economic ties.&nbsp; New memberships are being forged.&nbsp; And increasingly, the world is seeing the Mideast &#8212; the Middle East through the lens of opening and opportunity.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me state clearly that the United States is going to remain an active, engaged partner in the Middle East.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the world grows more competitive and the challenges we face more complex, it is only becoming clearer to me that &#8212; how closely interwoven America’s interests are with the successes of the Middle East.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will not walk away and leave a vacuum to be filled by China, Russia, or Iran.&nbsp; And we’ll seek to build on this moment with active, principled American leadership.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our new framework for the Middle East has five key principles, and I’d like to very briefly share them with you today.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, the United States will support and strengthen partnerships with countries that subscribe to the rules-based international order.&nbsp; And we will make sure that these &#8212; those countries can defend themselves against foreign threats.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The United States and each of the countries around this table are an essential part of that order because we reject the use of brute force to change borders.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the entire GCC, plus Egypt and Jordan, voted in the United Nations General Assembly to condemn Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, it was a watershed moment.&nbsp; It showed that the core values of sovereignty and territorial integrity are truly universal.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I want to be clear: Supporting a rules-based order doesn’t mean we always have to agree on every issue, but it does mean we align around core principles that allow us to work together on the most pressing global challenges.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, on food security, we are collectively committing billions of dollars to alleviate the crisis here in the region, with more than $1 billion coming from the United States.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On energy security, we agree on the need to ensure adequate supplies to meet global needs.&nbsp; Energy producers have already increased production, and I look forward to seeing what’s coming in the &#8212; in the coming months.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And on the climate crisis, we’re collectively investing hundreds of billions of dollars in clean energy initiatives, increasing our climate ambition, and working together to diversify supply chains and invest in critical infrastructure.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And we’re looking forward to Egypt and the UAE hosting the next two major U.N. climate conferences.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, the United States will not allow &#8212; will not allow foreign or regional powers to jeopardize the freedom of navigation through the Middle East’s waterways, including the Strait of Hormuz and the Bab al-Mandab.&nbsp; Nor will we tolerate efforts by any country to dominate another in the region through military buildups, incursions, and/or threats.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The free flow of commerce and resources through the Middle East is the lifeblood of a global economy.&nbsp; That’s as true today as it been &#8212; as it has been for decades.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And when nations adhere to international rules, it works.&nbsp; So my administration has made it a priority to protect those vital waterways.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We’ve established a new naval task force to work in partnership with many of your navies to help secure the Red Sea.&nbsp; That includes the first naval task force to use&nbsp;<s>multi-manned</s>&nbsp;[un-manned] surface vessels and artificial intelligence technology to enhance marine &#8212; maritime awareness.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We’re also integrating air defenses and early warning systems to ensure that we can defeat airborne threats.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, the United States will not just aim to deter threats of regional &#8212; to regional stability; we will work to reduce tensions, de-escalate, and end conflicts wherever possible.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This approach is already reaping dividends.&nbsp; As was mentioned: In Yemen, working closely with Saudi Arabia, Oman, the UAE, and the U.N., we forged a truce that is now in its 15th week.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We’ve welcomed the leadership Of Iraqi Prime Minister Kadhimi to bring countries from the nei- &#8212; from the neighbor- &#8212; from the region together for talks in Baghdad.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks to the months of quiet, persistent diplomacy, we helped finalize an agreement to remove international peacekeepers from Tiran Island in the Red Sea, and transform an area that once sparked wars into a future hub of peaceful tourism and economic development.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And as we continue to work closely with many of you to counter the threats posed by &#8212; posed to the region by Iran, we’re also pursuing diplomacy to return constraints on Iran’s nuclear program.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But no matter what, the United States is committed to ensuring that Iran never gets a nuclear weapon.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourth, the United States will build political, economic, and security connections between the United States &#8212; between the U.S. partners wherever possible, while respecting each country’s sovereignty and independent choices.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Integration, interconnection &#8212; these are the underlying themes of our meeting today.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How many years have we been trying to connect Iraq’s electricity to the &#8212; to the G- &#8212; to the GCC grids?&nbsp; I remember being briefed on it in 19- &#8212; in 2016, when I was Vice President of the United States.&nbsp; I said, “Let’s get it done.”</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, today, finally, after years of failed efforts and false starts, thanks to the efforts of so many around this table, it’s done.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; New energy projects linking the region, a new free trade deal and investments between neighbors, like the Saudi investments in Egypt and Jordan.&nbsp; The more we build these connections, the more we’ll see the benefits that return to our peoples and will grow.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fifth, the United States will always promote human rights and the values enshrined in the U.N. Charter.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Foundational freedoms are foundational to who we are as Americans.&nbsp; It’s in our DNA.&nbsp; But it’s also because we know that fai- &#8212; that the future will be won by the countries that unleash the full potential of their populations, where women can exercise equal rights and contribute to building stronger economies, resilient societies, and more modern and capable militaries; where citizens can question and criticize their leaders without fear of reprisal.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I’ve gotten plenty of criticism over the years.&nbsp; It’s not fun.&nbsp; But the ability to speak openly and exchange ideas freely is what unlocks innovation.&nbsp; Accountable ins- &#8212; accountable institutions that are free from corruption, that act transparently, and respect the rule of law are the best way to deliver growth, respond to people’s needs, and, I believe, ensure justice.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And no country gets it right all the time &#8212; even most of the time &#8212; including the United States.&nbsp; But our people are our strength.&nbsp; Our countries, with the confidence to learn from their mistakes, grow stronger.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So let me conclude by summing all this up in one sentence: The United States is invested in building a positive future in the region, in partnership with all of you, and the United States is not going anywhere.<br><br>This is a table full of probi- &#8212; problem solvers.&nbsp; There are a lot of &#8212; there’s a lot of good we can do if we do it together.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you again for inviting me to participate in this summit today, and thank you for the many years of partnership between your countries and the United States.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May God protect our troops.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>
