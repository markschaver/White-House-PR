<p class="has-text-align-center">James S. Brady Press Briefing Room</p>



<p>5:23 P.M. EST</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Hi, everyone.&nbsp; Good evening.&nbsp; Okay, well, back by popular demand, just a few days after his first engagement with us, Daleep is here.&nbsp; He is going to give some brief remarks at the top about the sanctions announcement today.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He has a hard out, so he&#8217;s only going to be &#8212; be able to take a few questions today, but we&#8217;re grateful to have you here.&nbsp; So I&#8217;ll kick it over to you.</p>



<p>MR. SINGH:&nbsp; Russia&#8217;s long-previewed invasion of Ukraine has begun and so, too, has our response.&nbsp; Today, the President responded swiftly and in lockstep with Allies and partners.&nbsp; The speed and coordination was historic.&nbsp; In previous sanctions regimes, it took weeks and months to mount a decisive response. This time, we announced our first tranche of sanctions in less than a day and in lockstep with Allies and partners in the European Union, the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, and Australia.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let me say a few words about the details of the package.&nbsp;</p>



<p>(A cellphone disrupts the briefing.)</p>



<p>First &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Hi.&nbsp; (Laughter.)</p>



<p>MR. SINGH:&nbsp; Hello.&nbsp; There&#8217;s no easy segue from that.&nbsp; (Laughter.)</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sanctions &#8212;</p>



<p>MR. SINGH:&nbsp;&nbsp;(Laughs.)&nbsp; Close your ears.</p>



<p>First, after consultations overnight with Germany, Russia&#8217;s Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline will not become operational.&nbsp; That&#8217;s an $11 billion investment in a prized gas pipeline controlled by Russia that will now go to waste, and it sacrifices what would have been a cash cow for Russia&#8217;s coffers.</p>



<p>But it&#8217;s not just about the money.&nbsp; This decision will relieve Russia&#8217;s geostrategic chokehold over Europe through its supply of gas, and it&#8217;s a major turning point in the world&#8217;s energy independence from Russia.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Second, we&#8217;ve demonstrated the potency of our financial sanctions.&nbsp; And make &#8212; make no mistake: This is only the sharp edge of the pain we can inflict.</p>



<p>In lockstep with our Allies, we&#8217;re fully blocking from the global financial system the fifth-largest Russian financial institution, V.E.B.&nbsp; This is a glorified piggybank for the Kremlin that holds more than $50 billion in assets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We&#8217;re also fully blocking Promsvyazbank.&nbsp; This is a bank that holds $35 billion in assets that finances the activities of the Russian military.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In plain English, full &#8212; full block means these banks can no longer make any transactions with the U.S. nor with Europe, as Europe matched our actions, and their assets in our respective financial systems will be frozen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And let me be totally clear: No Russian financial institution is safe if the invasion proceeds.&nbsp; We are ready to press a button to take action on the two largest Russian financial institutions, which collectively hold almost $750 billion in assets &#8212; or more than half of the total in the Russian banking system.</p>



<p>Third, together with our Allies, we&#8217;ve also cut off the Russian government, the Russian Central Bank, and Russian sovereign wealth funds from new financing from the U.S. and Europe.&nbsp; The Kremlin can no longer raise money from the U.S. or Europe, and its new debt can no longer trade on U.S. or European financial markets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fourth, we have fully sanctioned a group of Russian elites and their family members.&nbsp; These individuals share in the corrupt gains of the Kremlin, and they will now share in the pain.&nbsp; Other Russian elites and their family members are now on notice that additional actions could be taken on them as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I also want to take a minute to address a key part of the President&#8217;s speech on energy markets.&nbsp; We were deliberate to direct the pain of our sanctions towards the Russian economy, not ours.&nbsp; None of our measures are designed to disrupt the flow of energy to global markets.&nbsp; And we are now executing a plan in coordination with major oil producers and major oil consumers to secure the stability of global energy supplies.</p>



<p>Let me just end where I started: This was the beginning of an invasion, and this is the beginning of our response.&nbsp; The actions we took today were only the first tranche.</p>



<p>If Putin escalates further, we will escalate further using financial sanctions and export controls, which we&#8217;ve yet to unveil but which are fully prepared to implement with Allies and partners across the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lastly, make no mistake: Our response goes well beyond sanctions and export controls.&nbsp; We&#8217;re continuing to fortify NATO&#8217;s eastern flank to reinforce our sacred Article 5 commitment to defend every inch of NATO territory.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just today, the President announced that additional troops and equipment will be shifted within Europe to the Baltics.&nbsp; We’ll continue to provide defensive assistance to Ukraine.</p>



<p>Already, over the past year, we&#8217;ve provided $650 <s>billion</s> [million] to this effect &#8212; the most of any year.&nbsp; And we&#8217;ll continue to work with Allies and partners to provide economic assistance to Ukraine with the ide- &#8212; idea being: We want to create a successful alternative in Ukraine to Russian-style kleptocracy, which may be Putin&#8217;s greatest fear of all.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Josh.</p>



<p>MR. SINGH:&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Can you speak a little bit more about the energy component?&nbsp; What tools do you have in the tool chest, given that there&#8217;s been an effort ongoing now for several months to control the price increases that we’re seeing for gasoline in particular?&nbsp; What can you do to help energy prices not spike the way that President Biden appears to worry that will?</p>



<p>MR. SINGH:&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; So this is an ongoing effort and a sensitive effort.&nbsp; I can give you a bit &#8212; a bit of detail on what that involves.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Number one, it involves coordinating our actions with major energy <s>producers</s> [consumers].  We all have reserves at our disposal, and those reserves could help support the supply of energy worldwide. </p>



<p>Number two, we&#8217;re working closely with major energy producers.&nbsp; Many of them have &#8212; several of them have the spare capacity to provide supply to global energy markets and to balance the market in the event of any supply disruption.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Number three, we can work with energy companies to surge their capacity to supply energy to the market, particularly as prices rise.</p>



<p>And number four, we can be very clear that if President Putin weaponizes energy supply, it will be met with massive consequences and it will only accelerate the diversification of Europe and the world away from Russian energy.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And can you speak, quickly, to the decision to what seems to be delinking the sanctions?&nbsp; Initially, the President was signaling if there is an invasion or a further invasion that the sanctions would come full stop, one swoop.&nbsp; Now we&#8217;re seeing, sort of, more of a tit-for-tat approach.&nbsp; You&#8217;re warning here today that if President Putin goes further, so will the sanctions.<br><br>Can you walk us through that process at all?&nbsp; It seems like the U.S. is now breaking its sanction package into chunks, whereas the expectation had been that it would come all at once.</p>



<p>MR. SINGH:&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; Well, look, today&#8217;s package is a severe action &#8212; I walked through the elements of it &#8212; with Nord Stream, the financial sanctions, sovereign debt, and the elites.&nbsp;<br><br>Number two, it&#8217;s just the beginning.&nbsp; This was the beginning of an invasion; this is just the beginning of our response.<br><br>But number three &#8212; and this really gets to your question, I think, most fundamentally: No one should think that it&#8217;s our goal to max out on sanctions.&nbsp; Sanctions are not an end to themselves.&nbsp; They serve a higher purpose.&nbsp; And that purpose is to deter and prevent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They&#8217;re meant to prevent and deter a large-scale invasion of Ukraine that could involve the seizure of major cities, including Kyiv.&nbsp; They&#8217;re meant to prevent large-scale human suffering that could involve tens of thousands of casualties in a conflict.&nbsp; And they&#8217;re meant to prevent the installation of a puppet government, controlled by Moscow, that subjugates the will of Ukraine and prevents the people of Ukraine from choosing their own destiny and setting their own course.&nbsp; That&#8217;s what this is all about.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:  Cecilia.<br><br>Q    What&#8217;s it going to take to target Putin directly?</p>



<p>MR. SINGH:&nbsp; I&#8217;m not going to &#8212;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why not do that today?<br><br>MR. SINGH:&nbsp; I&#8217;m not going to telegraph exactly what it would take and under what circumstances that would occur.&nbsp; But no option is off the table, as the President said.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the EU President said today “this is the most dangerous moment in European security in a generation.”&nbsp; So if not today, when?&nbsp; What?<br><br>MR. SINGH:&nbsp; Look, as I say, we mounted a very significant response today; we can escalate that response further.&nbsp; There are a number of actions we can take using financial sanctions, export controls, fortifying our eastern flank, helping Ukraine defend itself, helping each other deal with the costs and consequences of Russia&#8217;s invasion, and, most importantly, having a shared confidence among Allies in our way of life, our economic model, our political model.<br><br>If Russia wants to sequester itself from Western technology, the Western economy, and from Western financial markets, that is a bad strategic choice for Russia.&nbsp; But we&#8217;re going to step up in solidarity to advance our values and principles.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Zeke.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; You mentioned that sanctions are meant to deter and prevent, but the fact of the matter is the sanctions you&#8217;re announcing today and announced last night did not deter or prevent Russia&#8217;s actions yesterday and over the weekend.&nbsp; What gives you any confidence that the remaining sanctions that haven&#8217;t been imposed yet can deter or prevent a further Russian invasion and aggression in Ukraine?</p>



<p>MR. SINGH:&nbsp; Well, look, it&#8217;s &#8212; it&#8217;s day one.&nbsp; And President Putin has choices to make; we have choices to make.&nbsp; Our job is to manage risks and to impose consequences for a further escalation of this conflict by President Putin.&nbsp;<br><br>We can do that through financial sanctions.&nbsp; We can do that through export controls.&nbsp; We can do that through fortifying NATO&#8217;s eastern flank.&nbsp; We can do that through providing defensive assistance to Ukraine.&nbsp; We can do that by being prepared for any energy market impact that occurs from Russia&#8217;s choices.&nbsp; Those are the choices that are within our disposal.&nbsp;<br><br>And let me just take a step back and talk about sanctions.&nbsp; You know, we have principles that matter in terms of how we design a sanctions package.&nbsp; They need to be powerful enough to demonstrate our resolve and the capacity to impose overwhelming costs.&nbsp; They should be calibrated such that we can maximize coordination with our Allies and partners.&nbsp; They should maintain flexibility so we can escalate or deescalate depending on what Putin does.&nbsp; They should be responsible so that we avoid unwanted spillovers to the U.S. and global economy.&nbsp; And they need to be sustainable.&nbsp; They work over time, not on day one.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Weijia is going to have to be the last one.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Singh, can you tell us why Putin himself was not sanctioned?<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; So just to follow up &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I think &#8212;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean, I know you&#8217;re trying to explain &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Weijia is going to ask a question.&nbsp; Simon, you got &#8212;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; because when you are doing it by &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Simon, you got a question last week.&nbsp; So we’re just trying to diversify it a little bit.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah, I just wanted to &#8212;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can we have an answer to that one, though?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Simon, can you let Weijia ask a question?&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Go ahead, Weijia.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; I know that you just talked about all the actions that you&#8217;re taking to counter any oil shortages that might drive up gas prices.&nbsp; But today, the President himself was very blunt about how they could impact Americans.&nbsp; So can you just give us a sense of when Americans might feel a difference when they fill up their gas tanks?<br><br>And then, secondly, to follow up on what Zeke was just asking, both you and the President said today that these sanctions will be in response, will be &#8212; if Putin escalates, you will escalate.&nbsp; So that sounds like they are going to be in response now and not meant to deter.&nbsp; So do you still view them as being a deterrence, or are they just a punishment at this point?</p>



<p>MR. SINGH:&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; So the first question on energy markets and the impact of our actions and when they&#8217;ll take effect in markets: Look, again, I &#8212; I don&#8217;t want to go into specifics, but there are actions that energy consumers can take with their strategic reserves.&nbsp; There are actions that energy producers can take in terms of their spare capacity.&nbsp; There are actions that energy producers can undertake to increase their production of energy in the current circumstance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I&#8217;m not going to give you a timeline, but the collective power of those actions and all the other tools and authorities that are at our disposal, plus diplomatic maneuvers that are at &#8212; that are at our disposal &#8212; collectively, we think, will be effective in bringing down the price of gas and the price of oil.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Thank you, Daleep.&nbsp; Thank you so much for joining us.&nbsp; He will come back, I promise.&nbsp; And I promised he would not be too late for his meeting.&nbsp;&nbsp;So thank you so much for joining us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Okay.&nbsp; I apologize to those of you who did not get questions from Daleep.&nbsp; We will have him back, and we will make him available in other capacities as well to all of you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I have one very unrelated no- &#8212; but still very important item for you at the top, and then we&#8217;ll get back to our discussion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today in Arizona, Interior Secretary Deb Haaland announced the Interior Department&#8217;s plan to fulfill settlements of Indian water rights claims using historic funding from President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.</p>



<p>The Infrastructure Law provides $2.5 billion to implement the Indian Water Rights Settlement Completion Fund, which will help deliver long-promised water resources to Tribes and a foundation for future economic development for entire communities dependent on common water resources.</p>



<p>Following feedback from the Tribal consul- &#8212; from Tribal consultations, the Department will allocate $1.7 billion this year alone from the Infrastructure Law to enact &#8212; to enacted settlements that have outstanding federal payments necessary to complete their terms.</p>



<p>With that, Zeke, why don’t you kick us off.&nbsp; And we will get around to as many people as possible, and I realize it&#8217;s already late.&nbsp; Go ahead.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; If you could walk through the events of the last 24 hours.&nbsp; Last night, a senior administration official on a background call with reporters briefed &#8212; a briefing on the administration&#8217;s response and said that Russia has occupied these regions since 2014 and that Russian troops moving into the Donbas would not in and of &#8212; would not &#8212; it would not itself be a new step and didn&#8217;t use the word “invasion.”</p>



<p>This morning, the Deputy National Security Advisor said “invasion,” and the President is using “invasion.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>What changed in the last 24 hours?&nbsp;&nbsp;What did you see on the ground that changed the U.S. government&#8217;s assessment of what is actually happening in eastern Ukraine?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; Well, I&#8217;m not going &#8212; I know this isn&#8217;t exactly what you&#8217;re asking.&nbsp; But just to set the precedent here, I&#8217;m not going to be confirming military movements from the podium now or at any point probably.&nbsp; But what I can tell you is what we looked at is the events of the last less than 24 hours, Zeke.&nbsp; Right?&nbsp; And what we have seen is President Putin setting up a rationale to take more territory by force.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What we&#8217;re basing that on &#8212; including the comments of the Deputy National Security Advisor this morning and then the President&#8217;s comments later in the afternoon &#8212; is a couple of things: One, Vladimir Putin announced yesterday that he was basically planning to carve out a chunk of Ukraine by recognizing two regions of Ukraine as independent.&nbsp; He brazenly asserted these regions are no longer part of Ukrainian sovereign territory.&nbsp; Last night, he authorized Russian forces to deploy into these regions.&nbsp; Today, he sought authorizations &#8212; authorization from the Duma for the Russian military to use force outside of Russian territory.&nbsp; And today, he asserted that these regions actually extend deeper into Ukraine, claiming larger areas currently under jurisdiction of the Ukrainian government.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, what we&#8217;re seeing there &#8212; and as for anybody who read or paid attention to his lengthy speech last night &#8212; is the rationale to go much further.&nbsp; That is what we are also watching very closely.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And this com- &#8212; for this combination of reasons, we see this as the beginning of a further invasion of Ukraine.&nbsp; But we look at and we assess over the course of a short period of time.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And &#8212; but right now, could you say whether or not the U.S. government believes that there&#8217;s been additional deployments of Russian forces &#8212; active forces &#8212; across the border into Ukraine?&nbsp; They’ve been there for years, but additional forces.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I&#8217;m not going to get into military assessments of military movements from here.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then on a separate topic, the President &#8212; Daleep talked to this as well &#8212; warned Americans over the last several weeks that they have to &#8212; they should be prepared to bear the cost of standing up for Ukraine’s sovereignty.&nbsp; And, you know, there&#8217;s been a lot of conversation about this.&nbsp; And I was hoping you could maybe speak to &#8212; clarify this a little bit: Why should Americans, you know, feel that they have to &#8212; you know, that is a cost that they should have to bear and that should affect their lives?&nbsp; And how much should they be prepared for this, you know, geopolitical crisis to impact their day-to-day living?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I think what, hopefully, the American people who are tuning into this or have been tuning into this will see is that the President of the United States and his entire national security apparatus have been rallying the world and standing up against the efforts of Russia to invade and take &#8212; and carve out a chunk of another country for their own.&nbsp; And that is &#8212; the world is standing with the United States against the actions of President Putin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, why does that matter?  I realize that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re asking me.  Why does that matter to the American people?  That should matter because that is a fundamental value that we, as a country, stand up for, and we stand up against that type of action.  That goes back to World War Two.  And we have repeatedly throughout history been leaders in the world in rallying support <s>for</s> [against] any efforts to seize territory from another country. </p>



<p>What the &#8212; when the President spoke to the American people last week, it was very important to him to be very direct and clear and straightforward with them about what this could mean as we looked to what the impact of an invasion could mean and also what the impact of sanctions could mean, and the fact that standing up for values is not without cost, including in this case &#8212; including, potentially, in this scenario.</p>



<p>Now, as Daleep just conveyed, what the President has said to his national security team is he wants to leave no stone unturned.&nbsp; He wants them to take every step possible to tap into the resources of global suppliers, to present to him any option that will reduce the impact on the American people.&nbsp; And even as he&#8217;s looking at sanctions, he is taking that into account.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But this is about standing up for American values and making &#8212; and he wanted to make clear to them what impact that could have.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.&nbsp; Given what Secretary Blinken just announced about his meeting with Lavrov on Thursday, is a summit between the President and Putin out of the question now?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, we&#8217;re never going to completely close the door to diplomacy, and I don&#8217;t think the Secretary of State did that either.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But just to build on what he just said, diplomacy can&#8217;t succeed unless Russia changes course.&nbsp; And as he said, it wouldn&#8217;t be appropriate for him to have a meeting with his counterpart at this point in time &#8212; Foreign Minister Lavrov. And it was always intended that any engagement with President Putin would follow that.</p>



<p>So, at this point, that is certainly not in the plans.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And what would &#8212; what would it take to get that conversation back to the table &#8212; to reconsider a meeting between the two leaders?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, de-escalation.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; That&#8217;s what it would take.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which &#8212; which &#8212; how do you define that?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; “De-escalation” means moving troops.&nbsp; It means de-escalating from what the steps they continue to take on a daily basis appear to be.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then a second topic, quickly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How many Supreme Court nominees has the President interviewed by this point?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; (Winks at the press.)&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; That was a wink.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I appreciate your question.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does that mean three?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I understand, Weijia, why you&#8217;re asking.&nbsp; We are, of course, a very short period of time away from the end of the month of February.&nbsp; The President has not made a decision about who he is going to nominate, but I&#8217;m not &#8212; still not going to get into details about the internal process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; More to tell soon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead, Peter.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.&nbsp; The President said in the spring that Pentagon generals had briefed him that the greatest threat facing America is global warming.&nbsp; Is that still the assessment now that we are facing down a potential cyber war with Russia?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I &#8212; let me first say: There is no &#8212; while we are always prepared for any threat that any outside entity or country poses to the United States as it relates to cyber or anything else, there is no current pending threat on &#8212; as it relates to cyber.</p>



<p>In terms of the threats you&#8217;re &#8212; you&#8217;re touching on, that was a briefing from the military, so I&#8217;d point you to them.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so, as far as anybody watching who&#8217;s seen the coverage, it&#8217;s very &#8212; at times, distressing images of Russian military movements &#8212; the number-one threat facing the country right now remains global warming?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, Peter, I think it&#8217;s important, as we&#8217;re all educating the public here, to convey and reiterate: The President has no intention of sending U.S. troops into Ukraine to fight in Ukraine.&nbsp; What we are doing is we are abiding by our obligations to our NATO Allies and partners to ensure that they have the support and the resources that they need.&nbsp; And that is our right and our obligation as the United States.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; And why do you guys think that sanctions are going to stop Putin if his goal ultimately is to redraw the map so it looks like it did 70 or 80 years ago?&nbsp; What sanction is going to stop him from doing that?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I think, just to kind of reiterate maybe something you touched on there &#8212; for anyone who watched his speech last night, what he made clear in that speech is that he doesn&#8217;t even necessarily &#8212; or doesn&#8217;t recognize the independence of Ukraine as a country.&nbsp; And that certainly gives us an indication of where his intentions are at this point in time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sanctions can be a powerful tool.&nbsp; They have been in a lot of moments throughout history.&nbsp; And what we view them as &#8212; or how we&#8217;re viewing them as we&#8217;re starting high, as Daleep just conveyed here, in terms of the significance and the severity of the sanctions that were announced today &#8212; yes, our intention is to have a deterrent effect.&nbsp; And there are &#8212; while what they have done to date is completely unacceptable, there are certainly far worse that could happen.&nbsp; What we want to do is prevent a large-scale invasion &#8212; death and destruction across Ukraine, devastation to the Ukrainian people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And that what happens with the sanctions is they work over time.&nbsp; They&#8217;re not an end.&nbsp; They&#8217;re not intended to max out at the beginning.&nbsp; They&#8217;re long-lasting and sustainable, and they&#8217;re intended to squeeze.</p>



<p>But if you look at what is happening now, what President Putin has stated as his intention is he wants to divide NATO. The opposite of that has happened, Peter.&nbsp; He also wanted to &#8212; a geopolitical project, Nord Stream 2, to go forward; that has not happened.&nbsp; He wants to make sure there is a vibrant economy for the Russian people; they&#8217;re not on that track.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, his intentions and his objectives are not playing out.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But so, I guess, to follow up on that: The President said before he got here that “Putin knows, if I am President of the United States, his days of tyranny and trying to intimidate the United States and those in Eastern Europe are over.”&nbsp; It&#8217;s two and a half years later.&nbsp; He is intimidating the United States and those in Eastern Europe.&nbsp; What happened?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I&#8217;d hardly put it that way.&nbsp; I would look at it, actually, from the prism of: The United States and President Biden has rallied the world, rallied Europe to stand up against the efforts and the actions of President Putin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You don’t think people who are totally strapped for cash &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; And we &#8212; we&#8217;ve laid out very clearly exactly &#8212;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; right now are intimidated by $4 gas, $5 gas, however high you guys think it&#8217;s going to go?&nbsp; Something like that is not intimidating?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; You asked me if we were intimidated by President Putin, and I think the evidence of that doesn&#8217;t exist.</p>



<p>Go ahead, Kristen.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.&nbsp; If I can try one more time &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; on sanctions.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The President of Ukraine on Saturday urged &#8212; called on the United States and its Allies to impose the toughest sanctions.&nbsp; And as all of these questions suggest, President Putin doesn&#8217;t seem to be deterred at this point.&nbsp; Why not choke him &#8212; Russia &#8212; out financially right now as a way to try to stop him?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, here&#8217;s how we and our national security team looks at sanctions &#8212; it&#8217;s a very good question; I think it&#8217;s actually a different one than what was asked &#8212; is we look at them through a couple of &#8212; for a couple of purposes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One, not that they are going to be an end on their own.&nbsp; Just the announcement of sanctions is not &#8212; is not going to have the immediate impact.&nbsp; They&#8217;re not intended to work that way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They&#8217;re not &#8212; we&#8217;re not &#8212; they&#8217;re not intended to max out at the beginning.&nbsp; This is why we&#8217;ve always intended to have a range of sanctions, steps that we could plus-up to or escalate to if his behavior and his actions continue to be escalatory.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And also, if we do all the sanctions now, what is the deterrent effect or impact of preventing him to take further action?&nbsp; That is what &#8212; the conversation we&#8217;ve been in with the global community, and that is how we&#8217;ve been approaching it to date.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator Lindsey Graham says President Biden is “missing the moment.”&nbsp; Does he run the risk of being too cautious here with this tranche approach?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We &#8212; in what capacity is he missing the moment?&nbsp; What did Senator Graham say?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lindsey Gra- &#8212; I&#8217;ll read you the entire &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Okay, go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; quote.&nbsp; “This is a critical moment in history…. President Biden is NOT seizing the moment.&nbsp; The sanctions outlined are woefully inadequate to deter Putin’s&#8221; &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Did he say that before or after we announced the sanctions?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He&#8217;s been saying this consistently.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, look, I think it&#8217;s an important question because what we &#8212; what the President announced was the sanctioning of two enormous financial system &#8212; institutions that is essentially going to make it more difficult for people close to President Putin and in the Russian elite to do business.&nbsp; And this is just the beginning.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When do you think they&#8217;ll start to feel the impact? When will they feel the bite?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, they&#8217;re going to be imp- &#8212; they&#8217;re going to be implemented immediately.&nbsp; So, obviously, it takes some time, but our effort and our focus is on implementing them immediately. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And going back to President Biden&#8217;s statement that he wants to mitigate the impact on Americans: Can you tell Americans how much pain will they feel with this first tranche?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:  Well, I think what we&#8217;re looking at here, Kristen is, of course, the impact on natural gas <s>producers</s> [consumers] primarily is in Europe, and we&#8217;re working to help them too, but also on the oil markets. </p>



<p>And, obviously, there are many additional steps that President Putin could take, and what we&#8217;re seeing is that he has every intention of taking.&nbsp; So, I can&#8217;t give you a projection of that.&nbsp; Some of it depends on what the actions are.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But do you think Americans will feel the impact in the coming weeks of these round &#8212; this round of sanctions?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Again, it really depends on what the steps are.&nbsp; What &#8212; what was announced today was significant sanctions on Russian elite and on financial institutions there.</p>



<p>The people who will be largely impacted are in Russia on those.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I could just try one more.&nbsp; SWIFT &#8212; not in this initial rollout.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; In the ini- &#8212; not in the initial tranche, but remains on the table.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will it be in the next rollout if there needs to be another rollout?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I can&#8217;t give you a prediction of that.&nbsp; But again, we have a range of options that remain on the table significant &#8212; that would have a significant and devastating impact on the Russian economy.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve already seen, in the Russian economy, the impact on inflation there and on the markets there of the expectation of these &#8212; of these sanctions, but all of those options remain on the table, and I can&#8217;t make a prediction of what&#8217;s next.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, the President today used words like “bizarre” and “twisted” to describe Putin&#8217;s remarks.&nbsp; Does the administration believe &#8212; on what they saw in his speech yesterday or in the last 24 hours, if you will &#8212; that Putin has shown some kind of change in his state of mind, in his demeanor?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I wouldn&#8217;t say we&#8217;d characterize it that way, Cecilia.&nbsp; I mean, if you &#8212; for those of you who read or watched his speech last night &#8212; which was rife with historical inaccuracy, of course &#8212; he made clear that he does not view Ukraine &#8212; not just the areas he recognized yesterday, but the totality of Ukraine &#8212; as an independent country.</p>



<p>And he did &#8212; and he conveyed that by providing a lot of revisionist history details that are not aligned with what has happened over the last few decades.</p>



<p>Now, we&#8217;ve seen some of that rhetoric, if you look back &#8212; back to 2008, and even before then.&nbsp; But it is indicative of, you know, of his own belief that he has the right as &#8212; of Russia &#8212; and he has the right to take the territory, to claim territory from another country.&nbsp; And we just don&#8217;t agree with that, obviously.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And if sanctions don&#8217;t work, then what?&nbsp; What else is in the toolbelt at the President&#8217;s disposal at this point?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, sanctions can take a number of formats.&nbsp; Right?&nbsp; Export controls is certainly one of them.&nbsp; There&#8217;s many more sanctions that we have at our disposal.</p>



<p>SWIFT &#8212; the SWIFT system is obviously significant and not in the first tranche.&nbsp; But there&#8217;s a range of options that remain on the table for sanctions.</p>



<p>And again, as Daleep conveyed, but I think this is an important component for &#8212; to &#8212; to know is that they&#8217;re not intended to have an impact on the fir- &#8212; the harshest impact on the first day.&nbsp; They&#8217;re attempted &#8212; they&#8217;re planned or they&#8217;re designed to have a squeezing impact over the course of time.&nbsp; And we have many more escalatory steps that we could take.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, do you have specific agreements with countries, exporters to ensure Europe has a steady supply of gas?&nbsp; Or is that still a work in progress?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I certainly understand your question.&nbsp; As Daleep said, it&#8217;s a very &#8212; at a very sensitive time in the process right now.&nbsp; But what we&#8217;re doing right now is talking both to major natural gas producers to understand their capacity and willingness to surge nat- &#8212; natural gas output, which of course is a regional issue that would have an impact in Europe, and also talking, as he said, to a range of producers to &#8212; to help assess &#8212; or help reduce the market impact and the impact on the American public.&nbsp; But I just can&#8217;t outline any more details on it from here.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you talk about the American &#8212; the impact that you’re &#8212; on the American public, you mean, specifically, Americans should expect higher gasoline prices.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah, energy prices.&nbsp; Exactly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; That&#8217;s &#8212; that&#8217;s what we want the American public to be aware is a possibility.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And are you announcing more oligarchs tomorrow?&nbsp; Is that the plan?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don’t have anything to preview for you at this point in time.&nbsp; But I can certainly check if there’s another tranche coming tomorrow.&nbsp; Absolutely.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, given that the President stressed today that diplomacy is still available but now the Blinken-Lavrov meeting is off, you just said, this future summit between the President and Putin is not in the plans anymore &#8212; can you help paint a picture of what exactly diplomacy looks like in terms of dealing with Russia?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, first, we still &#8212; the door to diplomacy still remains open.&nbsp; And it just &#8212; as I think our foreign &#8212; our Secretary of State conveyed, it isn&#8217;t the appropriate time, as Russia is taking escalatory steps and preparing to invade, for him to meet with the foreign minister.</p>



<p>And it had always been the intention that any engagement with President Putin would be discussed there and potentially (inaudible) there.&nbsp; But there were never any specific plans or timeline, really, in the works for that.&nbsp; So, it was really going to be discussed at that meeting.</p>



<p>What diplomacy looks like: One, we&#8217;re going to continue to engage with our European partners, of course, and we will continue to remain open to &#8212; to having diplomatic conversations once &#8212; if and when they de-escalate.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Diplomatic conversations &#8212; so, certainly between President Biden and President Putin in the future?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, of course, that remains an option.&nbsp; And as we’ve said, I think, over the course of the last few days, he&#8217;s always going to be open to having leader-to-leader conversations, but this isn&#8217;t the time to do it when &#8212; and we said this at the time as well &#8212; when they are &#8212; when President Putin is overseeing the invasion of a sovereign country.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And just quickly, what is the U.S. assessment right now of Russian invasion into Kyiv?&nbsp; Is that considered an immediate danger right now?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; It con- &#8212; it is considered &#8212; I&#8217;m not going to give you a timeline, but it&#8217;s considered a real possibility, yes.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For weeks, Jake Sullivan and other top officials have said that the administration and the White House has learned the lessons of 2014, and you will enact &#8212; in sanctions, you will enact “start high and stay high,” rather than gradually escalate.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Mm-hmm.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As you talk about the chunks and different trenches, it seems you are doing the opposite.&nbsp; Why is that the approach that you’re taking &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Not true, actually.&nbsp; We actually didn’t sanction these type of financial institutions back in 2014.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right.&nbsp; But just more of the broad &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; And it took several weeks to sanction these types of institutions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But more in terms of the theory of the case &#8212; that instead of doing it in pieces, where you start and then continue to add on, the lessons that Jake and others have signaled was that you “start high and stay high,” instead of doing it more piecemeal.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, that’s exactly what we’re doing.&nbsp; So, the announcement that was made today about these financial institutions is more significant that was &#8212; than what was done in 2014.&nbsp; And we would only build further from here.&nbsp; So, that is starting high and staying high.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What Russian actions would trigger the fullest extent of U.S. sanctions?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I&#8217;m just not going to detail what exact reaction will be to each action.&nbsp; Obviously, we have a range of options at our disposal.&nbsp; They&#8217;re &#8212; all remain on the table, and our preference is, of course, de-escalation, not instituting more sanctions.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the administration confident that sanctions and export controls can or will be enough to turn to deter Putin?</p>



<p>And can you go into any more detail about what those export controls might look like?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I can&#8217;t go into specific &#8212; more specifics.&nbsp; Just a range of options are on the table.&nbsp; And obviously, export control actions would have a significant additional impact on the economy there.</p>



<p>In terms of &#8212; tell me your first part of your question again?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, yeah.&nbsp; Just is the administration confident that sanctions and export controls can deter Putin?&nbsp; Are they enough?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, part of what sanctions are is &#8212; they’re intended to be a deterrent, but they&#8217;re also intended to have a squeezing, significant impact on the economy that is felt over a sustainable period of time that makes it more difficult to continue those behaviors and those actions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They&#8217;re not &#8212; they&#8217;re not intended or designed to be an end when they&#8217;re initially announced.&nbsp; So that &#8212; those are the range of options we have at our disposal, and there will continue to be a growing impact.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; The President said last week that he was hoping to, maybe, work with Congress on some sort of proposal to address energy prices.&nbsp; Is that still on the table or is this focus now on sort of diplomacy with producers and consumers?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; All is on the table.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And what might that look like?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Discussions with Congress?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; Would it be in the form of legislation to lower prices?&nbsp; I mean, what kind of policies is &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; That is an option, but I don&#8217;t have anything to detail for you at this point in time.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, on another subject, the U.S. and several countries are close to reaching a nuclear deal with Iran.&nbsp; What&#8217;s the likelihood of an agreement, you know, this week, in your view?&nbsp; And would the U.S. agree to a deal that does not include the release of U.S. and British prisoners held by Iran?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, let me &#8212; let me start with your second question because this is a really important one.&nbsp; But the discussions on unjustly detained and innocent Americans remains separate from the JCPOA talks.&nbsp; Special Envoy Malley has reiterated, “…it&#8217;s very hard for us to imagine getting back into the nuclear deal” &#8212; or agreeing to kind of a new iteration of the deal, to the point of your question &#8212; “while four innocent Americans” &#8212; and others &#8212; “are being held hostage by Iran.”</p>



<p>It&#8217;s really a matter of urgency to bring the detainees home, and we want it to be resolved immediately.&nbsp; But it is happening from a &#8212; through a separate channel &#8212; those conversations.</p>



<p>In terms of the status of the JCPOA talks, we have made substantial progress &#8212; or substantial progress has been made over the last week or so, and is continuing to be made.&nbsp; Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.&nbsp; And so, until then, I&#8217;m not going to give you a rosy assessment.&nbsp; But it is, of course, good that substantial progress has been made.&nbsp; If Iran shows seriousness, we believe we can and should reach an understanding on mutual return to full implementation of the JCPOA.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And just real quick, is the President concerned at all about the convoy of truckers that is making its way to Washington?&nbsp; And has he taken any sort of steps to protect the city?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yes, we&#8217;ve actually been monitoring this closely.&nbsp; The Department of Homeland Security and the administration are tracking reports of a potential convoy that may be planning to travel to several U.S. cities, including Washington, D.C.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have been working, including from Dr. Liz Sherwood-Randall here, as well as our Homeland Security Department with &#8212; closely with our federal, state, and local partners to continuously assess the threat environment and keep our communities safe.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And our efforts include enhanced intelligence sharing, a Critical Incident Response Plan for the U.S. Capitol, a regional security assessment, and a simulation experiment that developed data-driven recommendations to bolster regional security.</p>



<p>So, we are closely monitoring, closely watching, and working with state and local authorities.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; First, I just want to thank everybody &#8212; I know it’s late &#8212; who is &#8212; we’re limiting our questions so that more people can &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yes, sure.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, I appreciate that.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; And if anybody needs to go for a hit or anything, nobody will take it personally.&nbsp; I know some people have.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, one question, of course, on Ukraine, first of all: Daleep said just now that today&#8217;s sanction package is, quote, “just the beginning of it.”&nbsp; Does that mean if nothing changes, you expect more sanctions?&nbsp; Or what does that mean “just the beginning of it”?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; It means we have a range of additional options that we have the ability to take.&nbsp; And if President Putin continues to escalate, so will we.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then on &#8212; looking to the State of the Union, when was the last time President Biden spoke to a member of Congress about any item in the Build Back Better agenda?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; He has a range of conversations all the time, but I&#8217;m not going to detail the timeline of those for you.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; When can we expect a more detailed explanation from the White House about how it would plan to bring down energy prices?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I think, as Daleep just conveyed, a lot of what&#8217;s happening right now is sensitive.&nbsp; It includes conversations with foreign counterparts and other major large global suppliers.&nbsp; It also includes conversations we&#8217;re continuing to have with Congress and others about what steps may be at our disposal.&nbsp; And the President is continuing to consider options.&nbsp; So I expect we&#8217;ll have more to tell you when &#8212; if any decisions are made.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And given what we have heard publicly from the Russians in the last several days, what level of concern does the White House have that the conflict could spill over out of Ukraine and into some of the other nations that the U.S. has vowed to protect militarily and are part of NATO?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, without making any prediction of that, what I can tell you is that one of the steps we&#8217;ve taken, including an announcement that the Department of Defense made today about a plussing-up of an additional 800 personnel to the Baltic region from Italy, is that we take our commitments to our NATO Allies and partners seriously, and we are going to continue to take steps to plus up their support and ensure that they know that they have the backing of the United States.&nbsp; But I&#8217;m not going to make any other predictions of that.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks a lot.&nbsp; The NSC’s Brett McGurk&#8211;</p>



<p>(A noise interrupts the briefing.)</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; That was a little scary.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The NSC’s Brett McGurk and the State Department’s Amos Hochstein &#8212; I hope I didn’t butcher it too much.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;Hochstein.&nbsp; But it’s okay.&nbsp; Yes.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hochstein.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; I just wanted to ask: What concrete assurances were they able to secure on managing potential market pressures from Saudi Arabia?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I certainly understand the question.&nbsp; We did confirm that they went on a trip.&nbsp; And they discussed a range of issues, including Yemen, but also including steps to take to &#8212; steps we can all take to coordinate and reduce the impact on the global market on oil &#8212; of oil.&nbsp; But I can&#8217;t detail anything further from here.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If one of the objectives is not to disrupt global energy flows, and energy prices are high and rising, how can Russia&#8217;s bottom line really be hurt if you don&#8217;t disrupt global (inaudible) flows?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I think Russia&#8217;s bottom line can be hurt in a lot of ways, including the range of sanctions we&#8217;ve already announced today and additional sets of sanctions that we have at our disposal should they choose, whether it&#8217;s sanctioning additional individuals or taking more significant steps that would real- &#8212; would impact their financial market.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, there&#8217;s no question we have a range of tools that could continue to have crippling impacts on the Russian economy.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But so much of their revenue comes from oil and energy.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I understand what you&#8217;re saying.&nbsp; But we also have a range of tools that could impact a range of their financial mar- &#8212; have huge financial market impacts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And the President is also looking at and we&#8217;re all assessing what steps we can take that will have a crippling impact on them while reducing the impact on the American public.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; I&#8217;m just trying to get a better idea of what the administration deems to be an &#8220;escalation&#8221; on the part of Russia.&nbsp; And, two &#8212; and what would prompt an additional tranche of sanctions?&nbsp; Would it only be the expansion of Russian forces to non-occupied republics or areas of Ukraine, or would it be the continued deployment of forces to the two separatist regions that were detailed yesterday?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I think as we&#8217;ve seen &#8212; as you have seen, hopefully &#8212; as Russia has taken any escalatory steps, we have taken escalatory steps on our end in the form of sanctions.&nbsp; And so, I&#8217;m not going to outline for you, “If this, then then.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>But I think if &#8212; for those of you, again, who watched the speech last night, the President &#8212; President Putin direct &#8212; attacked Ukraine&#8217;s right to exist.&nbsp; He explicitly threatened war unless his extreme demands were met.&nbsp; He gave an entire speech selling a war to the Russian people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our expectation &#8212; and we hope we are wrong &#8212; is that he will continue to take escalatory actions and further invade the country, and we will take additional steps in response.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the administration preparing any sort of measures for Ukrainians already in the United States, such as TPS or any other sort of immigration protections, for those who might not want to go back (inaudible)?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure, I don&#8217;t &#8212; obviously those decisions or assessments are made by the Department of Homeland Security.&nbsp; I can&#8217;t make a prediction of that at this point in time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Obviously, what we are doing on the ground is trying to provide a range of economic, humanitarian, and security assistance to the Ukrainian government.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I understand you&#8217;re asking about people who are here.&nbsp; And obviously we are preparing for the potential for major humanitarian outflows that could go into Europe and have a range of needs, and so that is also something we are closely tracking.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We are also pre- &#8212; poised to increase our support to the people of Ukraine should additional humanitarian needs arise.&nbsp; Our response would be based on assessment of the needs, our partners’ emergency appeals, in coordination with our European allies and partners.</p>



<p>But we are assessing the humanitarian assi- &#8212; situation on the ground very closely, and we&#8217;re going to continue engage with Allies and partners about any humanitarian needs that escalate and refugee outflows if they are to continue to occur.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Given we&#8217;re getting close to the deadline, just &#8212; are SCOTUS interviews done at this point?&nbsp; I know it&#8217;s all in process and it&#8217;s &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I know.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, you know, are they done at this point?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; The long national process will soon be over, Zolan.&nbsp; That&#8217;s the good news.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I&#8217;m not going to detail the status.&nbsp; But I can tell you that the President has not made a decision yet, but we remain on track for him to make a decision and make an announcement before the end of the month.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; I know you said you didn&#8217;t like military questions too much.&nbsp; But &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; No, I love military questions.&nbsp; I&#8217;m just not going to outline military movements from here.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Okay, fine.&nbsp; Because, you know, one &#8212; one kind of salient aspect to this whole thing has been actually openness of the U.S. in giving military details about what the Russians are up to, so I&#8217;m wondering if you can go a little further with that.</p>



<p>It seems important &#8212; that people don&#8217;t really understand, like, these &#8212; you know, the so-called peacekeepers, like, how many are there?&nbsp; Are they in Donbas now?&nbsp; Is it a handful of people?&nbsp; Is it a few guys with, like, you know, jeeps, or is it tons of tanks, missiles?&nbsp; I don&#8217;t think Americans really have a good idea of what it is &#8212; what this invasion actually consists of right now.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; And I appreciate &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So if you can say anything on that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And another question would be: There&#8217;s obviously no U.S. trainers in Ukraine anymore.&nbsp; Will this training &#8212; military training relationship continue in a third country?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; On the second, I would point to the Department of Defense, who&#8217;s best equipped to answer that question.</p>



<p>On the first: It&#8217;s a really important one.&nbsp; You know, I think it&#8217;s important for the American public, who may be just tuning in, to know that there has been a military &#8212; Russian military presence in Ukraine since back to 2014, which they never admitted, they never acknowledged.&nbsp; In some ways, they&#8217;ve only recently acknowledged.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Back in 2014 and in the years after, we called them &#8220;the little green men&#8221; because they were not in Russian military uniform.&nbsp; Now we know that they are all over eastern Ukraine.&nbsp; And they are &#8212; while not in uniform, they are behaving just like Russian military would be behaving.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So that is something &#8212; I can&#8217;t give you a number or specifics from here because I can&#8217;t get into intelligence.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But it is important for the American people to know that &#8212; that regardless of whether they&#8217;re in uniform or not, they&#8217;ve been there since 2014.&nbsp; They are representing the Russian government.&nbsp; They are separatists who are &#8212; we probably should stop calling them &#8220;peacekeepers&#8221; because they are certainly not that &#8212; who are, you know, helping to lay the predicate for war.&nbsp; And that is what the purpose of a lot of them is there for.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay, but did anything change in the last 24 hours?&nbsp; I think that&#8217;s &#8212; that&#8217;s really the question.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not going to &#8212; I&#8217;m not going to be able to give you any additional assessment of that at this point in time from here.&nbsp; But I understand your question, and we&#8217;ll continue to work to give you more.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; Two quick questions on Nord Stream 2.&nbsp; The first is: The deputy director just said that stopping Nord Stream 2 relieved Europe of a &#8220;geostrategic chokehold&#8221; that Russia would have had on them.&nbsp; So, if Nord Stream 2 going online was such a threat, why, in May, did the President waive sanctions on the company and the chief executive behind it?</p>



<p>And my second question is: Is there a concern that Nord Stream 2 &#8212; if Russia were to make concessions or retreat in some way, that that might open up the door to Nord Stream 2 going back online?&nbsp; Or is it your understanding that it is dead no matter what Russia does?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would first say that, you know, the President has never been a supporter of Nord Stream 2.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve always criticized it as a &#8212; as a project that we didn&#8217;t support.&nbsp; We took a range of steps and sanctions &#8212; including sanctions, to make that very clear.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What &#8212; the announcement made by the German Chancellor today was not by accident; it was at the conclusion of a range of diplomatic engagements and efforts by the President and members of our national security team, in unity from the Europeans, about the fact that this could not move forward.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve never felt &#8212; the President didn&#8217;t feel that issuing pre-emptive sanctions on that was the right step to take.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But look where we are: Nord Stream 2 is not moving forward.&nbsp; And, by the way, it hasn&#8217;t been operational anyway.&nbsp; So, you know, that&#8217;s a fact; it&#8217;s not moving forward at this point in time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In terms of the future, we&#8217;ve never felt it was a good project.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve been clear about that.&nbsp; And that assessment I don&#8217;t expect would change in the future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.&nbsp; Does the White House any &#8212; have any reaction to former President Trump calling Putin&#8217;s move yesterday &#8220;genius&#8221; and &#8220;smart&#8221;?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, as a matter of policy, we try not to take advice from anyone who praises President Putin and his military strategy, which I believe is what happened there; expresses an openness to lifting sanctions about the seizing of territory in Crimea; or, at any point in time, told leaders of the G7 that Crimea is a part of Russia, regardless if they are a former president.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, there&#8217;s a bit of a different tactic, a bit of a different approach.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s probably why President Biden, and not his predecessor, was able to rally the world and the global community in taking steps against &#8212; against Russia&#8217;s aggression.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there any fear that statements like that could turn support for Ukraine into a more partisan issue among the U.S. public?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; By the former president?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I &#8212; you know, I think that is up to members of the Republican Party to make the decision, to make the determination.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It has &#8212; there is a long history, decades of history &#8212; which President Biden was a part of when he was Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee &#8212; of standing up to the efforts of any country to seize the territory of another country, standing up for efforts by the United States to rally global support against &#8212; against inappropriate and illegal actions by another country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There&#8217;s a long history of that &#8212; not in a partisan way, in a bipartisan way &#8212; and certainly that choice is up to Republicans to make &#8212; to determine.</p>



<p>Go ahead.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve got two questions quickly.&nbsp; The administration rolled out a list of sanctions against Russian oligarchs and elites.&nbsp; My question is: Are any of them being sanctioned for the first time, or are these, sort of, repeat bad offenders?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; That&#8217;s a good question.&nbsp; I&#8217;m sure we can get you a breakdown of that.&nbsp; I believe some of them are new, and certainly the banks are new.&nbsp; But let us get you a more specific breakdown of that.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then my second question is: The last time Jake Sullivan was here, he said that a Russian invasion of Ukraine would lead to U.S. sanctions, warning that that would necessarily make Moscow more beholden to Beijing.&nbsp; Obviously, both of those foreign powers aren&#8217;t exactly the most friendly to us.&nbsp; So, is the administration taking any steps or issuing any warnings to keep those geopolitical foes from, you know, aligning together and marching in lockstep?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, long before the events of the last few months, we saw China and Russia moving closer together in some capacity.&nbsp; But, right now, as we&#8217;re looking at the actions of President Putin and the &#8212; as we&#8217;re preparing for him to further invade Ukraine, to unfortunately put forward death and destruction on the country and the people of Ukraine, it&#8217;s really a question for China on whether they look at that and think that&#8217;s acceptable behavior.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, I think you saw that our Secretary of State had a conversation with his counterpart in the last 24, 48 hours.&nbsp; And we will certainly remain and continue to engage, but I think it&#8217;s about looking at where the global community is in this moment and determining where you want to stand.&nbsp;</p>



<p>La- &#8212; okay, go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; I wanted to ask about rapid COVID tests.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you have an update at this point on how many you’ve shipped and how many you have under contract?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I believe we do, but I&#8217;m going to have to get that to you after the briefing.&nbsp; We have &#8212; let me get that to you after the briefing because I think we have some updated numbers on that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think we&#8217;re going to have to wrap up shortly here.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I ask you one more?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Go ahead, in the back.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.&nbsp; I &#8212; I&#8217;m sorry.&nbsp; I had to step out &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; It&#8217;s okay.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; for a live shot for a moment.&nbsp; But &#8212; so if somebody asked this question, I&#8217;m sorry.&nbsp; But I would like to clarify what Daleep said at the beginning.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: Sure.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He said that Nord Stream 2 will go to waste now.&nbsp; So, do you have assurance from Germany that it&#8217;s &#8212; the decision to cancel the project is final, or it&#8217;s still reversible?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would really &#8212; I don&#8217;t have anything to build on beyond what &#8212; the strong statements and the strong comments of the Chancellor this morning and the President&#8217;s own statements about how it would not move forward.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Okay.&nbsp; Thanks, everyone.&nbsp; We&#8217;ll see you tomorrow.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>(Remote camera clicks repeatedly.)&nbsp; (Laughter.)</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; There&#8217;s a ghost photographer in the walls.&nbsp; (Laughs.)&nbsp; Where is Doug Mills?&nbsp; Is he back there?&nbsp; (Laughter.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">South Court Auditorium</p>



<p>3:50 P.M. EST</p>



<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Tom.&nbsp; Tom Conway, you going to say hi to me?<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. CONWAY:&nbsp; Mr. President, how are you?<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; I haven’t seen you in such a long time.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. CONWAY:&nbsp; Oh, it’s been a while.&nbsp; You doing all right?<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Yeah, you’re one of the only reasons I’m sitting in this chair.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; (Laughter.)<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, everybody.&nbsp; How are you?&nbsp; Gavin, how are you, man?<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GOVERNOR NEWSOM:&nbsp; (Inaudible) President.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Good to see you.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GOVERNOR NEWSOM:&nbsp; I’m good.&nbsp; I’m good.&nbsp; I had an over/under that you were going to do this today.&nbsp; I’m impressed.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; (Laughs.)<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GOVERNOR NEWSOM:&nbsp; I am impressed.&nbsp; Thank you for not canceling on us.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Oh, are you kidding me?&nbsp; We don’t have much going on, you know, other than Russia and Ukraine and &#8212; anyway.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Should we start?&nbsp; I guess I’m starting, huh?&nbsp; I guess I already started.&nbsp; (Laughter.)<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Good afternoon.&nbsp; I want to thank everybody joining us today virtually, including California’s outstanding governor, Gavin Newsom, who I went out to help with a recall and he won in spite of me &#8212; (laughter) &#8212; again.&nbsp; But &#8212; along with leaders from industry and labor and local communities, each of whom we’re going to hear from shortly.&nbsp; And, here at the White House, with Jennifer Granholm, our former governor and Energy Secretary; Gina McCarthy, our National Climate Advisor; and Kathleen Hicks, the Deputy Secretary of Defense.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And we’re here to make an announcement that sounds a little complex on the surface, but, really, it’s about something quite simple.&nbsp; It’s all about the belief we share that to build a truly strong economy, we need a future that’s made in America.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Almost exactly a year ago, I issued an executive order</p>



<p>to prioritize strengthening our domestic supply chains.&nbsp; Because what I found out was that, you know, if I was going to follow through on my commitment to say we were going to make it in America and build it America and have all of it built in America, we needed a supply chain that was &#8212; that was reliable.&nbsp; And &#8212; and including in critical materials like lithium, graphite, rare earth materials, which are badly needed for so many American products, but were so much in &#8212; we were in so desperate need of.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These minerals power phones and computers, household appliances, electric vehicles and batteries, solar panels, wind turbines, and so much more.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Without these minerals, we simply cannot fun- &#8212; they can’t function.&nbsp; And we expect to &#8212; demand to &#8212; for them to increase by 400 to 600 percent over the next several decades.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And up to now, we’ve had to import a significant portion of them &#8212; close to 100 percent importation &#8212; from other countries, particularly China, Australia, and Chile.&nbsp; And when I signed the executive order last year, I was determined to change that.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And we’ve seen what happens when we become dependent on other countries for essential goods like computer chips &#8212; everyone has become aware of that, because the computer chips are so badly needed.&nbsp; Why do the cost of automobiles skyrocket and become about a third of the reason for the increase in inflation?&nbsp; It&#8217;s because they didn’t have the computer chips.&nbsp; You can’t build an automobile today without those chips.&nbsp; As well as personal protective equipment and so much more.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And when it comes to clean energy, China has spent years</p>



<p>cornering the market on many of the materials that power the technologies that we rely on.&nbsp; That’s why I committed us to build a clean energy supply chain stamped “Made in America.”</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And “Made in America” means using products, parts, and materials, as well as minerals, right here that are in the United States of America, we get them.&nbsp; It means betting on American workers.&nbsp; And it takes a federal government that doesn’t just give up lip service to buying America but actually takes action.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My economic strategy &#8212; building from the bottom up and the middle out &#8212; is why in my first year as President we had the greatest year ever in job growth in American history: 6.6 million jobs.&nbsp; Faster economic growth in nearly &#8212; the fastest in nearly four decades.&nbsp; And that’s why America added 375 [thousand] manufacturing jobs last year &#8212; the highest increase in nearly 30 years.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And that’s why we’ve seen major announcements in recent weeks from companies like Intel, General Motors, Union Pacific Railroad, and more, building new facilities here in America, investing in American workers and buying American products and paying prevailing wages, Tom &#8212; prevailing wages, a union wage.&nbsp; They created tens of thousands of good-paying jobs in Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Tennessee &#8212; all across the country.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And today, we’re announcing a new effort that’s going to help us, in my view, keep that drumbeat for good-paying jobs, strengthen our national and economic security, and ensure that we can continue to build a future that’s made in America in a way that lives up to our values.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So we’re announcing a major investment in domestic production of key minerals and materials.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, as I mentioned, China &#8212; China controls most of the global market in these minerals.&nbsp; And the fact that we can’t build a future that’s made in America if we ourselves are dependent on China for the materials that power the products of today and tomorrow.&nbsp; And this is not anti-China or anti anything else; it’s pro-American.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That’s why I’m taking action.&nbsp; Through the Department of Defense &#8212; and I have Deputy Secretary to my &#8212; there you go, I thought to my right; the governor is to my &#8212; the Deputy Secretary is here &#8212; we’re investing $35 million in MP Materials, currently America’s only rare earth mining and processing operation, to help create a fully domestic supply chain for the magnets that power electric vehicle motors, wind turbines, and so much more.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We know that when the federal government invests in innovation, it powers up the private sector to do what they do best.&nbsp; And that’s what we’re seeing happen.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MP Materials is announcing a $700 million investment</p>



<p>in the magnet supply chain, creating 350 good-paying jobs.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Berkshire Hathaway Energy Renewables is breaking ground for a new facility this spring in your state &#8212; I know Gavin knows more about this than I do, but he &#8212; in &#8212; in California to test the new process to pull lithium, which is used for batteries for phones, for cars from underground sources in California’s Imperial Valley in a way that’s environmentally sustainable.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And last week, Redwood Materials announced a partnership</p>



<p>with Ford and Volvo to recycle lithium-ion batteries so you’ll be able to produce more of those batteries, taking out the minerals and reprocessing them so they can be used to power electric vehicles, reducing the need for new mining.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And that’s just the beginning, in my view.&nbsp; These new investments are going to do more than create good-paying jobs.&nbsp; They’re also going to set America up to lead the world in building a clean energy economy and the clean energy future.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we build the economy, we’re going to build around wor- &#8212; build it around working Americans.&nbsp; That means making sure that labor is at the table, that Tribes and the people from the community are at the table from day one, and that environmental protections are paramount.</p>



<p>We have to ensure that these resources actually benefit folks in the communities where they live, not just the shareholders.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s going to create good-paying union jobs, and that produces more sustainability.</p>



<p>You know, so &#8212; so we can avoid the historical injustices that too many mining operations left behind in American towns.&nbsp; I come from Scranton, Pennsylvania.&nbsp; It used to be an anthracite coal mine.&nbsp; And mining is mining is mining, but there&#8217;s all kinds of it.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s why we’re working to modernize America&#8217;s mining laws and regulations, some of which are 150 years old.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve asked the Secretary of Energy, Governor Granholm &#8212; Senator [sic] Granholm &#8212; senator &#8212; Secretary Granholm &#8212; but you&#8217;re my governor, former governor &#8212; to visit the Imperial Valley in California and hear directly from local residents how this will impact on them.</p>



<p>I know everybody is excited about the opportunities ahead.&nbsp; So, with that, I’m &#8212; we&#8217;re going to hear from Jim Litinsky, CEO of MP Materials. &nbsp;And, Jim, let&#8217;s start with a question: What will the Defense Department&#8217;s $35 million investment allow you to do in your process?</p>



<p>MR. LITINSKY:&nbsp; Well, thank you, Mr. President.&nbsp; It&#8217;s an honor to be here today.&nbsp; This DOD investment delivers on your call to action of a year ago to restore America&#8217;s supply chains.&nbsp; So your investment will complement more than $700 million that MP will invest by 2024 to create an American rare earth magnetics supply chain.&nbsp; As you said, these magnets are essential to our economy and the clean energy transition.</p>



<p>So, my team is committed to bringing this supply chain home, and we are doing so with an operation that is a benchmark for innovation and environmental sustainability.</p>



<p>You know, we proudly operate in the state of California, under the very high standards that should make all Americans proud.&nbsp; You know, we founded this company five years ago.&nbsp; At the time, Mountain Pass was in care and maintenance with only eight employees.&nbsp; Many actually doubted that it could ever be restored, but we got to work and built a great company poised to become an American champion.</p>



<p>So, I hope that our story is a symbol of what is possible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One thing I&#8217;ve learned, Mr. President, is that American manufacturing spirit is second to none when we all work together.&nbsp; But the truth is: Multi-billion-dollar supply chains do not move overnight.&nbsp; It&#8217;s going to require capital.&nbsp; It&#8217;s going to require perseverance.&nbsp; It&#8217;s going to require strong coordination between the upstream and the downstream.&nbsp; And most importantly, it&#8217;s going to require a true commitment from leadership across the board.</p>



<p>And, sir, convening this group today sends a powerful signal that is a catalyzing effect.&nbsp; So I want to thank you and your team.&nbsp; Thank you to the DOD.&nbsp; Thank you to Governor Newsom and everyone assembled here today.</p>



<p>I also want to recognize the 400 American heroes at MP who report to work every day with an unwavering commitment to see this mission through.</p>



<p>Thank you.</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Jim, do me a favor, for listeners: Tell me a little bit about the process that you undertake to allow us to compete with China, for example, and other countries, in terms of providing access to this rare material.&nbsp; Rare &#8212; I mean, you know &#8212; what we&#8217;re looking for.</p>



<p>MR. LITINSKY:&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Well, sir, the good news is, we are currently the second-largest producer in the world.&nbsp; And we have &#8212; and this may be a little detailed for those who don&#8217;t know about mining, but we have a dry tailings process, and 95 percent of the water we utilize is recycled.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So that means that not only are we competing globally, but we are also doing so in a way that, you know, as I&#8217;ve said, all Americans can be proud of.&nbsp; We are &#8212; you know, I can say confidently we are the most environmentally friendly rare earth operation in the world.</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Well, I was told by our &#8212; my environmental guru here that &#8212; she pointed out to me that, by 2025, we&#8217;re going to be producing 500,000 electric vehicles per year.&nbsp; You&#8217;ll &#8212; you&#8217;ll be able to provide material for 500,000 electric vehicles per year.&nbsp; Is that right?</p>



<p>MR. LITINSKY:&nbsp; That&#8217;s right, sir.&nbsp; We&#8217;re &#8212; we announced GM as a foundational customer for a magnetics facility that we are building.&nbsp; And so, I think the really important thing here is we are investing across the board, end to end, exactly as you have called for, so that we can have actually every aspect of this supply chain in the United States of America.</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Do I yield you now or do I go on?</p>



<p>ADMINISTRATOR MCCARTHY:&nbsp; You can go on.</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; I can go on?&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Alicia, tell me about you &#8212; what you guys are doing.</p>



<p>MS. KNAPP:&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Thank you, Mr. President.&nbsp; It&#8217;s an honor to be here with you today to talk about the exciting work we&#8217;re doing in Imperial County, California, and the benefits it could bring to the local community.</p>



<p>So, at BHE Renewables, we are working not just to secure a domestic source of lithium, but we&#8217;re working to secure the most abundant source of lithium in the United States, using the world&#8217;s most environmentally friendly technology, and providing economic and employment benefits in one of the most disadvantaged communities &#8212; counties in the country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, if this seems ambitious, it is.&nbsp; And there&#8217;s no one better suited to take on an ambitious task like this than Berkshire Hathaway Energy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve been operating geothermal plants in the Imperial Valley for 40 years, and we&#8217;re currently operating 10 geothermal plants by bringing superheated brine from several miles beneath the Earth&#8217;s surface and using steam from that brine to generate clean baseload power.&nbsp; And then we reinject the brine into the geothermal reservoir.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, what that means is that, right now, we are pumping 50,000 gallons per minute of lithium-rich brine to the surface.&nbsp; And because there is no proven commercially viable technology, we&#8217;re pumping it right back down into the ground.&nbsp; So, the good news is that we are currently undertaking two demonstration plant projects to prove that we can recover that lithium as we have it above ground in a commercially viable manner.</p>



<p>So, the first of those demonstration plants is actually going to come online this April.&nbsp; And in that phase, we will extract lithium from the brine.&nbsp; And that project is supported by a $6 million grant from the California Energy Commission.&nbsp; Thank you, Governor Newsom.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And the second phase of the demonstration is supported by a $14.9 million grant from the Department of Energy.&nbsp; So, thank you, Mr. President.</p>



<p>And in that phase, we will take the lithium we recovered in the first phase and convert it to battery-grade lithium compounds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If both of these demonstration projects are successful, we would then be in a position to begin construction of our first commercial plant in 2024 and, by 2026, be commercially extracting lithium from our geothermal brine.</p>



<p>As we undertake these demonstration projects, we&#8217;re engaging with the Lithium Valley Commission, which is a group of Tribal leaders, local community representatives, labor leaders, and environmental justice groups.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re engaging with them from day one to make sure that lithium production in the Imperial Valley is done in a way that benefits everyone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We&#8217;re also investing in local education.&nbsp; So, recently, we donated $130,000 to the Westmoreland Union Elementary School District, and we committed $25,000 in scholarships for STEM education at the local Imperial Valley College.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We&#8217;re also working with local educational institutions to develop programs &#8212; training programs, curriculum, internships, and hands-on opportunities at our site &#8212; to help prepare the local residents for future careers in the geothermal and/or lithium business.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, we&#8217;re definitely committed to delivering a secure lithium future and are living up to the values that you&#8217;ve laid out for us, Mr. President.&nbsp; So thank you, again, for the opportunity.</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Well, I think it&#8217;s really important.&nbsp; You know, I &#8212; we have to learn the lessons from the past couple hundred years of mining, generally.&nbsp; And I &#8212; I really mean it. And &#8212; and I understand &#8212; I&#8217;m told &#8212; I&#8217;m looking at my notes here &#8212; I&#8217;m told that you&#8217;re providing scholarships for local students taking STEM courses.&nbsp; Is that right?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. KNAPP:&nbsp; It is, yes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; And are you going to be developing internships as well?&nbsp; I mean, this is &#8212; I &#8212; correct me, Governor, if I&#8217;m wrong, but I think this has the fifth-highest unemployment rate in California and a poverty rate that is over 24 percent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, this ought to be not only good for lithium but good for &#8212; for the residents, I mean, if you&#8217;re really going to do that.&nbsp; Are you?&nbsp; Are you going to stick there in the community?</p>



<p>MS. KNAPP:&nbsp; Yes, absolutely.&nbsp; Like I said, we&#8217;ve been in this community for almost 40 years.&nbsp; We have been working with local educational institutions to develop the curricula that will train the workers for the lithium business of the future.</p>



<p>Also, internships, which apply to, you know, engineers.&nbsp; And &#8212; and things like that.&nbsp; And on-site, hands-on training opportunities for folks in the local community as well.</p>



<p>So, whatever your interest is &#8212; if it&#8217;s a four-year college, a two-year college, going straight to work &#8212; we&#8217;re making sure that we have opportunities for you at our plants in the Imperial Valley.</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Well, good.&nbsp; Well, we came up with a Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill that provided only $4 billion to help in this process.&nbsp; So I hope it &#8212; I &#8212; I ho- &#8212; stick with what you&#8217;re &#8212; what you&#8217;re saying.&nbsp; I appreciate it.</p>



<p>I mean, the $4 billion is for electric batteries.&nbsp; That&#8217;s a &#8212; you know, which you&#8217;re a big part of.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All right, well, thank you.&nbsp; And &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. KNAPP:&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Now, you got to let me know when I&#8217;m supposed to stop here.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But, Silvia &#8212; where is Silvia?&nbsp; There you are, Silvia.&nbsp; How are you, Silvia?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PAZ:&nbsp; I&#8217;m doing (inaudible).</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; You&#8217;re the Executive Director of the &#8212; of the operation.&nbsp; Can you tell me a little about what you&#8217;re going to be doing?</p>



<p>MS. PAZ:&nbsp; Yes, I&#8217;m &#8212; well, thank you, Mr. President.&nbsp; And, really, it&#8217;s a privilege to be joining you here, along with the governor of my state and all of the industry leaders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And you &#8212; I am the Executive Director of Alianza Coachella Valley.&nbsp; I also chair the Lithium Valley Commission.&nbsp; And, really, this &#8212; we have a great opportunity to really meet the community where they are.&nbsp; So I thank you for recognizing that the Salton Sea region is already battling with some of the highest unemployment rates.&nbsp; We were also one of the regions that are hardly &#8212; hardest hit by the COVID pandemic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, for the last 10 years, Alianza has been working alongside community members to address the issues that they see most important to their lives &#8212; the issues that a lot of times prevent barriers to them having real opportunities for economic progress.&nbsp; And those issues have been issues around infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And when we&#8217;re talking about infrastructure, we&#8217;re also talking about the same infrastructure that left our mostly agricultural community at a disadvantage when it came to being able to protect themselves from COVID.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We&#8217;re talking about an area that houses &#8212; is home to the largest body of water, the Salton Sea, that is facing environmental degradation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, when we &#8212; our community hears about the excitement around lithium, there is a cautious optimism because it falls around this context: a community that has seen unfulfilled promises.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And could this be a game changer?&nbsp; Yes, it could, if done right.&nbsp; What does it mean to do it right in the context of the community I just described?&nbsp; It means that we are going to have to double down on the investments going beyond incentivizing career and educational pathways.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We need to make sure that there&#8217;s investments to get this community ready.&nbsp; When we talk about the potential of lithium, we need to capture as many of the jobs as possible.&nbsp; We need to be able to capture as many of the supply chain elements as possible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But if I look at my community and I see that when there&#8217;s a high wind, you know, our powerlines fall, it leaves our communities without power, we have a long ways to go.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re really counting on the incentives that are coming from the federal level, that are coming from the state level to be able to do this right for our communities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We want to be at the table and help you understand what it means to us to have a prosperous economy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thank you, Mr. President.</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Well, thank you.&nbsp; We&#8217;re going to &#8212; at the federal level, we&#8217;re investing billions of dollars in making sure that you have resilience in your energy supplies.&nbsp; For example, you talk about, you know, the electric power and &#8212; and transmission lines and the like.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, there&#8217;s a lot going on.&nbsp; But one of the things that I&#8217;m glad to hear you continue to talk about is that, you know, when the tough stuff had to be done before we had environmental laws that really made a difference, all those fenceline communities, all those communities next to the places where they&#8217;re being done, suffered all the downside and didn&#8217;t get much of the benefits.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And it&#8217;s my hope and my expectation that those communities, like the farming community that rep- &#8212; that you represent, that you&#8217;re talking about, get the benefit of being able to be employed and being able to generate a living from what&#8217;s going to be happening here and are protected environmentally.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so, building out a battery supply chain in the region where you live, what kind of impact will that have on your residents, do you think?&nbsp; What &#8212; what&#8217;s your worry?&nbsp; And what&#8217;s your expectation and hope?<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PAZ:&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; The worry is that we can do this in an environmentally friendly manner, that it will not cause further environmental degradation in an area that&#8217;s already suffering from it.&nbsp; The hope is that we can really be transformative, that our community can be much more engaged from the beginning, determining where potential investments should go; that they can have a seat at the table when we&#8217;re talking about community workforce agreements and determining what percent of labor should come from the local region.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And if you ask me and you ask my colleagues on the ground &#8212; all of them &#8212; right? &#8212; we should prioritize local hiring.&nbsp; We want good jobs, quality jobs that are paying benefits.&nbsp; And we want to make sure, again, that this community is transformed beyond only building the industry up.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have a beautiful landscape, but we also have a landscape that needs additional infrastructure &#8212; roads, access to parks, access to the outdoors.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I think we have the right pieces to build from.&nbsp; There is &#8212; the values that you&#8217;ve mentioned are in alignment with the values that the community is asking for.&nbsp; The framework that I know Governor Newsom will talk about is in alignment with what we&#8217;re asking for.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, the hard part is in the details in implementing it and making sure that all of us can be working and having those tough discussions, whether it&#8217;s going to be that we&#8217;re asking for fees, royalties, community benefit agreements, and that we really let the community determine what those benefits ought to be.</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Well, thank you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gov, I think you agree that one of the great things about the country is that we don&#8217;t have to choose jobs over the environment or public health.&nbsp; And committing to the highest environmental standards could even be one of our nation&#8217;s most competitive advantages, if we&#8217;re smart about it.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve talked about that &#8212; you and I.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GOVERNOR NEWSOM:&nbsp; Yeah.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; What steps are you taking, together with industry workers, local communities to &#8212; and Tribal nations &#8212; to help us secure domestic sources of critical minerals in the right way?<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GOVERNOR NEWSOM:&nbsp; Yeah, well, first of all, I can&#8217;t impress upon you, Mr. President, how important your words are to the community.&nbsp; You heard that in Silvia, reflected in her comments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But look, at the end of the day, there &#8212; there is anxiety that &#8212; you know, with the &#8212; what we refer to as “the Saudi Arabia of lithium” down there in Imperial Valley, this extraordinary economic opportunity that now presents itself &#8212; that people can be left behind.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And to hear you reinforce that frame that it&#8217;s not just about growth in the abstract, it&#8217;s about inclusion, it&#8217;s about reconciling the past in making sure that our values are front and center in our policy to accelerate into the future.&nbsp; And so, just those words are important.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But I want you to know: We&#8217;re following up by codifying them and organizing, with Silvia and her team, with a community benefits package focusing not just on the economic opportunity but making sure that the growth and inclusion strategies include local hires, include local benefits in a sustainable way.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And that&#8217;s what&#8217;s so exciting, from my perspective, because it &#8212; you know, there&#8217;s an old African proverb that says, “You want to go fast, go alone.&nbsp; But if you want to go far, go together.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I think the opportunity to set this up where we can go deep in these conversations today, where we can accelerate those investments, presents itself anew.&nbsp; And you&#8217;re giving us an enormous amount of energy in this space with these new resources and a resourceful mindset where we also can address the twin problem which you began with, and that is national security and recognizing and reconciling the world we&#8217;re living in, and what are the trendlines that define that world, and becoming more supply chain &#8212; less dependent, but more independent in providing those domestic opportunities.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I&#8217;m very prideful, Mr. President, California is still the most dominant manufacturing state in America.&nbsp; Twenty-six percent of your jobs &#8212; American jobs came out of California in December &#8212; twenty-six percent.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We&#8217;re really proud of the American job recovery.&nbsp; We’re really proud of California&#8217;s approach.&nbsp; But it&#8217;s around creating policy that it can accelerate that growth but, again, with this mindset around sustainability.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so, thank you for, again, your leadership.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re really looking forward.&nbsp; We think this is big.&nbsp; We don&#8217;t want to understate it.&nbsp; We also don&#8217;t want to overstate it.&nbsp; We&#8217;re still doing a lot of the due diligence.&nbsp; But if it&#8217;s as big as it appears to be, this is a game changer in terms of our efforts to transition to low-carbon green growth and to radically change the way we produce and consume energy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And this is a hinge moment in the history that you&#8217;re making, not just here today but the work you&#8217;ve been doing the last year.</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Well, thanks, Gov.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I &#8212; I agree with you.&nbsp; This is one of those moments.&nbsp; It&#8217;s one of those inflection points in history.&nbsp; And I&#8217;ve been saying that &#8212; you and I, we&#8217;ve spent a lot of time together.&nbsp; You and I both talked about there&#8217;s certain &#8212; there&#8217;s so much that has the potential to change for the better, to fundamental &#8212; like the idea of all of us here talking about the combination of the economic, the &#8212; the technological breakthroughs, coupled with the impact on doing it in environmentally sound ways to produce changes in the nature of communities.&nbsp; And I think it just has enormous opportunity.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And as someone was pointing out to me today, your economy in California is bigger than about the size of Russia&#8217;s &#8212;</p>



<p>GOVERNOR NEWSOM:&nbsp; (Laughs.)</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; For real.&nbsp; No &#8212;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GOVERNOR NEWSOM:&nbsp; Twice.&nbsp; It’s twice the size, Mr. President.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Twice.&nbsp; Yeah, I know.</p>



<p>GOVERNOR NEWSOM:&nbsp; Fifth-largest economy in the world, so treat us well.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; (Laughter.)<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; But who’s paying attention, right?&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>No, but all kidding aside, it’s been great.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s &#8212; that&#8217;s mainly because I think &#8212; I&#8217;m going to turn this over to Gina McCarthy to facilitate the remainder of this conversation &#8212; but I think it&#8217;s in part because of the next guy she&#8217;s going to represent, the President of the United Steelworkers.&nbsp; But that&#8217;s a different section.&nbsp; (Laughter.)<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But anyway, thanks, Gov.&nbsp; Appreciate it, Gavin.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GOVERNOR NEWSOM:&nbsp; I appreciate you.</p>



<p>ADMINISTRATOR MCCARTHY:&nbsp; Thanks, everybody, and stick around.&nbsp; We&#8217;re going to ask the press corps if they don&#8217;t mind leaving at this point.&nbsp; And then we&#8217;ll start up the conversation again, if you don&#8217;t mind.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Via Teleconference</em><strong> </strong></p>



<p>3:34 P.M. EST</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MODERATOR:&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; And thanks, everyone, for joining today.&nbsp; So, as a reminder, this call is on background, attributable to a &#8220;senior administration official,&#8221; and the contents of this call are embargoed until the end of the call.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For your awareness but not for reporting, the speaker on the call is [senior administration official].&nbsp; And I think they&#8217;re going to have some remarks to start at the top, and then we can take some questions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, with that, I&#8217;ll turn it over to you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Yeah, thanks.&nbsp; Yes, I&#8217;ll make a few comments at the top and then happy to answer any of your questions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, Russia’s long-previewed invasion of Ukraine has now begun, and our response has also begun.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, we responded swiftly and in a united fashion with our Allies and partners.&nbsp; The speed and coordination of the response was historic.&nbsp; We announced our first tranche of sanctions in less than a day with Allies and partners from the European Union, from the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, and Australia.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This response was taken much faster and goes much further than what we did in 2014.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me say a few words about the details of the package.&nbsp; First, after consultations overnight with Germany, Russia&#8217;s Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline will not become operational.&nbsp; That&#8217;s an $11 billion investment and a prized gas pipeline controlled by Russia that will now go to waste, and it sacrifices what would have been a cash cow for Russia&#8217;s financial coffers.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But it&#8217;s not just about the money.&nbsp; This decision will relieve Russia&#8217;s geostrategic chokehold over Europe through its supply of natural gas, and it&#8217;s a major turning point in the world&#8217;s energy independence from Russia.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, we&#8217;ve made a demonstration of the power of our financial sanctions.&nbsp; And make no mistake, this is only the sharp edge of the pain we can inflict.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, again, in lockstep with our Allies, we&#8217;re fully blocking from the U.S. and European financial systems the fifth-largest Russian financial firm, which is V.E.B. &#8212; a glorified piggy bank for the Kremlin that holds more than $50 billion in assets.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And we&#8217;re also fully blocking a $35 billion bank, Promsvyazbank, that finances the activities of the Russian military.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In plain English, the full block of these banks means they can no longer make any transactions with the U.S. or Europe, and their assets in our respective financial systems are frozen.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And let me be totally clear: No Russian financial institution is safe if this invasion proceeds.&nbsp; We are ready to press a button to take further action on the very largest Russian financial institutions, including Sperbank and VTB, which collectively hold almost $750 billion in assets &#8212; or more than half the total in Russia as a whole.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, together with our Allies, we&#8217;ve also cut off the Russian government, the Russian Central Bank, and its sovereign wealth funds from U.S. financing.&nbsp; Europe has taken a very similar measure.&nbsp; That means the Kremlin can no longer raise money from the U.S. and Europe, and its new debt can no longer trade in U.S. or European markets.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourth, we have fully sanctioned a group of Russian elites and their family members.&nbsp; These individuals have shared in the corrupt gains of the Kremlin, and they will now share in the pain.&nbsp; Other Russian elites and their family members are now on notice that additional actions could be taken on them as well.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me also just take a minute to address a key part of the President&#8217;s speech on energy.&nbsp; We were quite deliberate to make sure that the pain of our sanctions is targeted at the Russian economy, not ours.&nbsp; So none of the measures are designed to disrupt the flow of energy to global markets, and we are now executing a plan in coordination with major oil consumers and oil producers towards our collective interest to secure the stability of global energy supplies.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me just stop there and take your questions.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, thank you.&nbsp; So, I just want to &#8212; you know, throughout the last couple of months, there’s been talk from administration officials about the idea of starting high and staying high.&nbsp; This appears, perhaps, more as starting medium.&nbsp; And I was wondering how does this square with the bigger idea of starting high and staying high, not having things like SWIFT in this first tranche of sanctions.&nbsp; And what was the thinking on not including some sort of levy to reinforce the German’s move on Nord Stream 2?&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Yeah, sure.&nbsp; So, first of all, these are &#8212; we are starting high.&nbsp; These are severe costs that we’re imposing.&nbsp; Nord Stream 2, for example, is Putin&#8217;s prized pipeline.&nbsp; He poured $11 billion into building the pipeline.&nbsp; It would have provided billions of dollars each year in revenues.&nbsp; That is now shut down after very close consultations overnight with Germany.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, you know, we made a demonstration out of two very significant Russian financial institutions, both of which have close ties to the Kremlin and the Russian military.&nbsp; They control over $80 billion in assets.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re clearly &#8212; I&#8217;m clearly signaling and the President has signaled we&#8217;re prepared to take action on other Russian banks, including the very largest ones.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then I think it is very significant that the U.S. and Europe have fully cut off the Russian government, its central bank, and its sovereign wealth funds from financing &#8212; from receiving financing from the U.S. and Europe.&nbsp; Over time, that&#8217;s going to mean higher borrowing costs, less capacity to invest, lower growth, lower productive capacity, and less overall ability for Putin to exert leverage on the world stage.&nbsp; So these costs are severe.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second point I would make is: Look, this is the beginning of an invasion and this is the beginning of our response.&nbsp; If Putin escalates further, we will escalate further, using both financial sanctions and export controls, which we&#8217;ve yet to unveil.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I want to also underline: Our response goes well beyond sanctions.&nbsp; We&#8217;re continuing to fortify NATO&#8217;s eastern flank to reinforce our sacred commitment to defend every inch of Allied territory.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You heard the President say that additional troops and equipment are going to be shifted within Europe to the Baltics.&nbsp; We&#8217;re going to continue to provide defensive military assistance to Ukraine.&nbsp; Already, we’ve provided $650 billion in the past year &#8212; the most ever.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re going to continue to work with Allies and partners to prepare for economic assistance that can help Ukraine become a successful alternative to Russian-style kleptocracy, which may be Putin&#8217;s greatest fear of all.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Senior administration official], did you ha- &#8212; were you saying something?</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MODERATOR:&nbsp; No, no.&nbsp; I think &#8212; [senior administration official], I think you were done, so I think we&#8217;re good for a second question, please.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Yeah, please.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah, who are the Russian elites that are being sanctioned?&nbsp; Do they include Vladimir Putin?&nbsp; And if Putin is not included, why not?</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Yeah, so I&#8217;ll name the Russian elites, which also includes their family members &#8212; and I apologize for the mispronunciation:&nbsp; Aleksandr Bortnikov and his son, Denis; Sergei Kiriyenko and his son, Vladimir; and Petr Fradkov, who is the CEO of Promsvyazbank.&nbsp; So these individuals and their relatives are all now fully blocked.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With respect to President Putin, I’ll just repeat what the President has said is: And all options remain on the table.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey, guys, thanks for doing this.&nbsp; I guess I just wanted to ask: You know, if we’re not going with the maximum sanctions right now, is there a fear that this sort of concedes the breakaway territories to the Ukrainian control &#8212; or to Russian control, rather?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Would you have gone bigger if not for &#8212; you know, we know that there was some reluctance in Europe heading into to this.&nbsp; And so, if you could at all talk about how this package came together and how European concerns weighed on what you went forward.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And then, I was also wondering if you had an update on the &#8212; the summits, both with Lavrov and Putin, that had been sort of floated &#8212; the Lavrov one later this week &#8212; in light of what&#8217;s happened.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; Hi, Justin.&nbsp; So, again, I mean, these &#8212; these are severe costs that we’re imposing today: shutting down Nord Stream, fully blocking two major financial institutions, cutting off the Russian government from Western financing.&nbsp; They’re severe actions, but this was the beginning of an invasion, and therefore this is the beginning of our response.</p>



<p>And I think, more fundamentally, just to get your question directly: No one should think that our ultimate goal is to max out on sanctions.&nbsp; They&#8217;re not an end to themselves.&nbsp; Sanctions are meant to serve a higher purpose, which is to deter and prevent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, we want to prevent a large-scale invasion of Ukraine that involves the seizure of major cities, including Kyiv.&nbsp; We want to prevent large-scale human suffering, possibly tens of thousands of lives that could be lost in a full-scale conflict.&nbsp; And we want to prevent Putin from installing a puppet government that bends to his wishes and denies Ukraine the freedom to set its own course and choose its own destiny.&nbsp; That&#8217;s what this is all about.</p>



<p>With respect to the potential discussions between Secretary Blinken and Minister Lavrov, I would just refer you to the State Department.&nbsp; Secretary Blinken is about to give remarks, and I think he&#8217;ll have more to say on that.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey, thanks so much for doing this.&nbsp; I wanted to ask, regarding SWIFT: At what point in the &#8212; and, I guess, the steps that Putin can take &#8212; perhaps, you know, taking a wider swath, going beyond these republics &#8212; is SWIFT going to be used or pulled from?&nbsp;</p>



<p>And second of all, should Americans expect for some higher gas prices in the coming weeks or months?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; Hi, Franco.&nbsp; So, with respect to SWIFT, as I mentioned last Friday and as you&#8217;ve seen today, SWIFT is not part of the first package of sanctions that we&#8217;ve rolled out.</p>



<p>And look, we think there are other severe measures that have comparable impact on Russia that we can take in lockstep with Europe and that don&#8217;t have the broader spillover costs.&nbsp; But I &#8212; we are not taking SWIFT off the table.&nbsp; It will remain an option that we can deploy, depending on &#8212; depending on how Russia makes its next move.</p>



<p>With respect to gas prices, energy prices, you know, I&#8217;ll just &#8212; I know there&#8217;s been some talk about whether energy prices are moving higher because of the Nord Stream 2 decision, and I would just emphasize: They are not moving higher because Nord Stream 2 is halted.&nbsp; They&#8217;re moving higher because they&#8217;re worried that Putin will weaponize energy supply and hold the world hostage.</p>



<p>So, the right response is to reduce Europe&#8217;s addiction to Russian gas, and that&#8217;s what today&#8217;s action does.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And in the meantime, we&#8217;ll continue to work with Europe to surge natural gas supplies from all over the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And as I mentioned at the outset of this call, with respect to oil, we have an ongoing effort right now to execute on a plan that&#8217;s in coordination with oil producers and oil consumers to make sure the world knows we&#8217;re going to have stable energy supplies.  And I think &#8212; I expect you&#8217;ll be hearing more from other countries very soon about that coordination effort.</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Next question, please.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi.&nbsp; (Inaudible) anyone have that sanctions deter Vladimir Putin, whether they&#8217;ve been small or large.&nbsp; Is there anything else in your toolkit beside sanctions?&nbsp; Because he doesn&#8217;t seem to be responding to these.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And was there any thinking that, given what President Zelenskyy said in Munich this weekend, you should start big &#8212; bigger &#8212; with SWIFT and other things that might get his attention rather than escalating slowly?</p>



<p>Thank you.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; Thanks, Andrea.&nbsp; Well, you know, sanctions &#8212; they work over time.&nbsp; And the pain is mounting in Russia.&nbsp; The stock market &#8212; if you look at its performance since November, it&#8217;s down more than 30 percent.&nbsp; The currency over the same time period is &#8212; has lost over 10 percent of its value.&nbsp; The interest rate that the markets are charging the Russian government to borrow has now spiked well above 10 percent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, you know, if you look back to 2014 when we imposed sanctions, the comments coming out of the leadership of the Russian government suggest that were it not for the costs that we imposed then, which are similar to what we&#8217;re imposing now, Putin may have gone much further, perhaps all the way to Kyiv.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, sanctions are not the only tool in our toolkit.&nbsp; As I mentioned, export controls are a key component of our potential sanctions response.&nbsp; And they&#8217;re similar in concept to financial sanctions.&nbsp; In both cases, we’re denying something to Russia that they need and they can&#8217;t replace from anywhere else or produce at home.</p>



<p>And so, export controls are really potent because we&#8217;re talking about critical technology inputs that Russia needs to diversify its economy, modernize its economy.&nbsp; And we are fully prepared with a very large number of countries across the world to implement those export control measures if the invasion proceeds.</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; I think &#8212; could we do our last question, please?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; [Senior administration official], you mentioned the sanctions would hit new issues of sovereign debt.&nbsp; Are there any &#8212; is there any impact on existing issues trading in the secondary market?&nbsp; And what&#8217;s your assessment of the ability or the willingness of Chinese financial institutions to fill the void left by the U.S. and Europe?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; David, so this &#8212; we&#8217;ve designed these sanctions so that Russia cannot raise money from U.S. investors.&nbsp; And Europe has implemented a very similar measure.&nbsp; And so, it&#8217;s the primary market that matters in terms of raising money.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s why we&#8217;ve directed our sanction towards that portion of the market.</p>



<p>Whether &#8212; as to whether China can replace U.S. and European investors: I mean, I think the numbers speak for themselves in terms of the percentage of the total that Dollars and Euro represent as a &#8212; as a source of borrowing.&nbsp; Also, just as currencies that are used to make payments, to receive payments, and also to store wealth, store value.&nbsp;</p>



<p>China&#8217;s share on all those metrics I just mentioned are in the low single digits.&nbsp; So it&#8217;s &#8212; it is &#8212; it is nowhere close to a substitute for the Western financial system.</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; All right.&nbsp; Thanks, everyone, for joining today.&nbsp; As a reminder, this call was on background, attributable to “senior administration official.”&nbsp; The embargo lifts officially now.&nbsp; If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me, and we&#8217;ll make sure to get back to you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thanks, everyone.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Thank you.</p>

<p>Dear Madam Speaker: (Dear Madam President:)<br><br>Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, within 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President publishes in the <em>Federal Register</em> and transmits to the Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the anniversary date.  In accordance with this provision, I have sent to the <em>Federal Register</em> for publication the enclosed notice stating that the national emergency with respect to Libya declared in Executive Order 13566 of February 25, 2011, and expanded in Executive Order 13726 of April 19, 2016, is to continue in effect beyond February 25, 2022.<br><br>Libyans confront ongoing instability originating from actions Colonel Muammar Qadhafi, his government, and close associates took against the people of Libya in 2011.  Civil conflict in Libya will continue until Libyans resolve their political divisions and foreign military intervention ends.  Because many of these divisions relate to access to resources, a serious risk remains that, if not protected, Libyan state assets will be misappropriated by parties determined to undermine the ongoing United Nations peace process, including former members of the Qadhafi government, members of the Qadhafi family, or Qadhafi&#8217;s close associates.  The diversion of these resources could prolong and deepen the current instability in Libya, which benefits ISIS and other terrorist groups that pose a serious threat to the national security of the United States and the security of regional partners.  We run the risk of military escalation if sanctions do not remain in effect, particularly since those who reject dialogue and obstruct and undermine Libya&#8217;s democratic transition remain interested in exploiting the wealth of the Libyan people to advance their narrow self-interest and perpetuate conflict in the country.<br><br>The situation in Libya continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, and we need to protect against the diversion of assets or other abuse by persons hindering Libyan national reconciliation, including Qadhafi&#8217;s family and associates.<br><br>Therefore, I have determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13566 with respect to Libya.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>On February 25, 2011, by Executive Order 13566, the President declared a national emergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States constituted by the actions of Colonel Muammar Qadhafi, his government, and close associates, which took extreme measures against the people of Libya, including by using weapons of war, mercenaries, and wanton violence against unarmed civilians.&nbsp; In addition, there was a serious risk that Libyan state assets would be misappropriated by Qadhafi, members of his government, members of his family, or his close associates if those assets were not protected.&nbsp; The foregoing circumstances, the prolonged attacks, and the increased numbers of Libyans seeking refuge in other countries from the attacks caused a deterioration in the security of Libya and posed a serious risk to its stability.</p>



<p>On April 19, 2016, the President signed Executive Order 13726, which expanded the scope of the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13566.&nbsp; The President found that the&nbsp;ongoing violence in Libya, including attacks by armed groups against Libyan state facilities, foreign missions in Libya, and&nbsp;critical infrastructure, as well as human rights abuses, violations of the arms embargo imposed by United Nations Security Council Resolution 1970 (2011), and misappropriation of&nbsp;Libya&#8217;s natural resources threaten the peace, security, stability, sovereignty, democratic transition, and territorial integrity of Libya, and thereby constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.</p>



<p>The situation in Libya continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, and measures are needed to protect against the diversion of assets or other abuses by members of Qadhafi&#8217;s family, their associates, and other persons hindering Libyan national reconciliation.</p>



<p>For this reason, the national emergency declared on February 25, 2011, and expanded on April 19, 2016, must continue in effect beyond February 25, 2022.&nbsp; Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13566.</p>



<p>This notice shall be published in the <em>Federal Register</em> and transmitted to the Congress.<br>                              </p>

<p>Today, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Xavier Becerra, Gender Policy Council Director Jen Klein, and Deputy Assistant to the President for Economic Mobility Carmel Martin hosted a conversation with parents and their children at the White House to discuss the need to cut the crushing child care costs families face and increase the supply of high-quality child care.</p>



<p><br>The Administration officials highlighted President Biden’s plans to make the largest investment in child care and preschool in the nation’s history, saving most working families more than half of their spending on child care and expanding the number of high-quality child care providers. The President’s plan would also enable states to deliver two years of free pre-school for every 3- and 4-year old in a setting of their parents’ choice – from public schools and child care providers to Head Start. They reiterated that early learning experiences help children succeed later in life; research shows that every $1 invested in high-quality early childhood care and education can yield $3 to $7 over the long-run, as children do better in school, are more likely to graduate high-school and college, and earn more as adults.</p>



<p><br>The parents attending the event shared that the high costs of child care and the difficulty of finding quality, affordable child care near their homes made it challenging for them to provide for their families and remain in the workforce. One family member noted spending more than $2,000 a month in child care expense and the immense strain that put on their family’s expenses. The families discussed how the pandemic exacerbated many of the challenges they were already facing when it comes to child care and emphasized how the President’s plans will help families access high-quality early childhood care and education.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Russian President Vladimir Putin of Russia recognized two regions of Ukraine as independent states and today claimed that recognition to include all of the Donbas region. The Russian Parliament also authorized the deployment of additional Russian forces into this Ukrainian territory.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As President Biden and our Allies and partners have made clear, we will impose significant costs on Russia for Russia’s actions. Today, the Administration is implementing the first tranche of sanctions that go far beyond 2014, in coordination with allies and partners in the European Union, United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, and Australia. And as President Biden promised, we worked with Germany to ensure the Nord Stream 2 pipeline will not move forward.</p>



<p>The President has directed the following measures:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Full blocking sanctions on two significant Russian financial institutions.</strong> The Secretary of the Treasury will impose full blocking sanctions on two large state-owned Russian financial institutions that provide key services crucial to financing the Kremlin and the Russian military: Vnesheconombank and Promsvyazbank and their subsidiaries. Collectively, these institutions hold more than $80 billion in assets and finance the Russian defense sector and economic development. These measures will freeze their assets in the United States, prohibit U.S. individuals and businesses from doing any transactions with them, shut them out of the global financial system, and foreclose access to the U.S. dollar.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Expanded sovereign debt prohibitions restricting U.S. individuals and firms from participation in secondary markets for new debt issued by the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, the National Wealth Fund of the Russian Federation, and the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation.</strong>  These prohibitions will cut off the Russian government from a key avenue by which it raises capital to fund its priorities and will increase future financing costs. It denies Russia access to key U.S. markets and investors.</li><li><strong>Full blocking sanctions on five Russian elites and their family members: Aleksandr Bortnikov (and his son, Denis), Sergei Kiriyenko (and his son, Vladimir), and Promsvyazbank CEO Petr Fradkov.</strong> These individuals and their relatives directly benefit from their connections with the Kremlin. Other Russian elites and their family members are on notice that additional actions could be taken against them.</li><li><strong>Today,</strong> <strong>the Secretary of the Treasury will determine that any institution in the financial services sector of the Russian Federation economy is a target for further sanctions.</strong> Over 80% of Russia’s daily foreign exchange transactions globally are in U.S. dollars and roughly half of Russia’s international trade is conducted in dollars. With this action,no Russian financial institution is safe from our measures, including the largest banks. </li></ul>



<p>These actions come in addition to steps being taken by our Allies and partners and represent our first response to Russia’s actions. As President Biden made clear, Russia will pay an even steeper price if it continues its aggression.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">East Room</p>



<p>2:22 P.M. EST</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Trying to make up your mind, huh?&nbsp; (Laughter.)</p>



<p>Well, good afternoon.&nbsp; Yesterday, Vladimir Putin recognized two regions of Ukraine as independent states and he bizarrely asserted that these regions are no longer part of Ukraine and their sovereign territory.&nbsp; To put it simply, Russia just announced that it is carving out a big chunk of Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last night, Putin authorized Russian forces to deploy into the region &#8212; these regions.&nbsp; Today, he asserted that these regions are &#8212; actually extend deeper than the two areas he recognized, claiming large areas currently under the jurisdiction of the Ukraine government.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He&#8217;s setting up a rationale to take more territory by force, in my view.&nbsp; And if we listen to his speech last night &#8212; and many of you did, I know &#8212; he&#8217;s &#8212; he&#8217;s setting up a rationale to go much further.</p>



<p>This is the beginning of a Russian invasion of Ukraine, as he indicated and asked permission to be able to do from his Duma.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, let&#8217;s begin to &#8212; so, I&#8217;m going to begin to impose sanctions in response, far beyond the steps we and our Allies and partners implemented in 2014.&nbsp; And if Russia goes further with this invasion, we stand prepared to go further as &#8212; with sanction.</p>



<p>Who in the Lord&#8217;s name does Putin think gives him the right to declare new so-called countries on territory that belonged to his neighbors?&nbsp; This is a flagrant violation of international law, and it demands a firm response from the international community.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over the last few months, we have coordinated closely with our NATO Allies and partners in Europe and around the world to prepare that response.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve said all along and I&#8217;ve told Putin to his face a mon- &#8212; a month a- &#8212; more than a month ago that we would act together and the moment Russia moved against Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Russia has now undeniably moved against Ukraine by declaring these independent states.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, today, I&#8217;m announcing the first tranche of sanctions to impose costs on Russia in response to their actions yesterday.&nbsp; These have been closely coordinated with our Allies and partners, and we&#8217;ll continue to escalate sanctions if Russia escalates.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We&#8217;re implementing full blocking sanctions on two large Russian financial institutions: V.E.B. and their military bank.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We&#8217;re implementing comprehensive sanctions on Russian sovereign debt.&nbsp; That means we’ve cut off Russia&#8217;s government from Western financing.&nbsp; It can no longer raise money from the West and cannot trade in its new debt on our markets or European markets either.</p>



<p>Starting <s>tomorrow</s> [today] and continuing in the days ahead, we will also impose sanctions on Russia&#8217;s elites and their family members.  They share in the corrupt gains of the Kremlin policies and should share in the pain as well. </p>



<p>And because of Russia’s actions, we’ve worked with Germany to ensure Nord Stream 2 will not &#8212; as I promised &#8212; will not move forward.</p>



<p>As Russia contemplates its next move, we have our next move prepared as well.&nbsp; Russia will pay an even steeper price if it continues its aggression, including additional sanctions.</p>



<p>The United States will continue to provide defensive assistance to Ukraine in the meantime.&nbsp; And we’ll continue to reinforce and reassure our NATO Allies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, in response to Russia’s admission that it will not withdraw its forces from Belarus, I have authorized additional movements of U.S. forces and equipment already stationed in Europe to strengthen our Baltic Allies &#8212; Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania.</p>



<p>Let me be clear: These are totally defensive moves on our part.&nbsp; We have no intention of fighting Russia.&nbsp; We want to send an unmistakable message, though, that the United States, together with our Allies, will defend every inch of NATO territory and abide by the commitments we made to NATO.</p>



<p>We still believe that Russia is poised to go much further in launching a massive military attack against Ukraine.&nbsp; I hope I’m wrong about that &#8212; hope we’re wrong about that.&nbsp; But Russia has only escalated its threat against the rest of Ukrainian territory, including major cities and including the capital city of Kyiv.</p>



<p>There are &#8212; there are still well over 150,000 Russian troops surrounding Ukraine.&nbsp; And as I said, Russian forces remain positioned in Belarus to attack Ukraine from the north, including war planes and offensive missile systems.</p>



<p>Russia has moved troops closer to Ukraine’s border with Russia.&nbsp; Russia’s naval vessels are maneuvering in the Black Sea to Ukraine’s south, including amphibious assault ships, missile cruisers, and submarines.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Russia has moved supplies of blood and medical equipment into position on their border.&nbsp; You don’t need blood unless you plan on starting a war.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And over the last few days, we’ve seen much of the playbook that Secretary Blinken laid out last week at the United Nations Security Council come to pass: a major increase in military provocations and false-flag events along the line of contact in the Donbas; dramatically staged, conveniently on-camera meeting of Putin’s Security Council to grandstand for the Russian public; and now political provocation of recognizing sovereign Ukrainian territory as so-called independent republics in clear violation, again, of international law.&nbsp;</p>



<p>President Putin has sought authorization from the Russian parliament to use military force outside of Russian territory.&nbsp; And this set the stage for further pretexts and further provocations by Russia to try to justify further military action.</p>



<p>None of us &#8212; none of us should be fooled.&nbsp; None of us will be fooled.&nbsp; There is no justification.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Further Russian assault into Ukraine remains a severe threat in the days ahead.&nbsp; And if Russia proceeds, it is Russia, and Russia alone, that bears the responsibility.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As we respond, my administration is using every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers from rising prices at the pump.&nbsp; As I said last week, defending freedom will have costs for us as well, here at home.&nbsp; We need to be honest about that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But as we will do &#8212; but as we do this, I’m going to take robust action and make sure the pain of our sanctions is targeted at the Russian economy, not ours.</p>



<p>We are closely monitoring energy supplies for any disruption.&nbsp; We’re executing a plan in coordination with major oil-producing consumers and producers toward a collective investment to secure stability and global energy supplies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This will be &#8212; this will blunt gas prices.&nbsp; I want to limit the pain the American people are feeling at the gas pump.&nbsp; This is critical to me.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the last few days, I have been in constant contact with European leaders, including with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy.&nbsp;&nbsp;Vice President Harris met in person with leaders in Germany over the weekend at the Munich Conference, including President Zelenskyy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At every step, we have shown that the United States and our Allies and partners are working in unison &#8212; which he hasn’t been counting on &#8212; Mr. Putin.&nbsp; We’re united in our support of Ukraine.&nbsp; We&#8217;re united in our opposition to Russian aggression.&nbsp;&nbsp;And we’re united in our resolve to defend our NATO Alliance.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re united in our understanding of the urgency and seriousness of the threat Russia is making to global peace and stability.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yesterday, the world heard clearly the full extent of Vladimir Putin’s twisted rewrite of history, going back more than a century, as he waxed eloquently, noting that &#8212; well, I’m not going to go into it, but nothing in Putin’s lengthy remarks indicated any interest in pursuing real dialogue on European security in the year 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He directly attacked Ukraine’s right to exist.&nbsp; He indirectly threatened territory formerly held by Russia, including nations that today are thriving democracies and members of NATO.&nbsp; He explicitly threatened war unless his extreme demands were met.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And there is no question that Russia is the aggressor.&nbsp; So we’re clear-eyed about the challenges we&#8217;re facing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nonetheless, there is still time to avert the worst-case scenario that will bring untold suffering to millions of people if they move as suggested.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The United States and our Allies and partners remain open to diplomacy if it is serious.&nbsp; When all is said and done, we’re going to judge Russia by its actions, not its words.</p>



<p>And whatever Russia does next, we&#8217;re ready to respond with unity, clarity, and conviction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’ll probably have more to say about this as we &#8212; if it moves on.&nbsp; I’m hoping diplomacy is still available.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thank you all very much.</p>
