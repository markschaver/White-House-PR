<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;For generations, courageous men and women of our Nation&#8217;s law enforcement community have dedicated their lives to protecting us in big cities, small towns, and suburban neighborhoods across America.&nbsp;&nbsp;Each morning, police officers pin&nbsp;on their shield and walk out the door to go to work, hoping they will come home safely.&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, a record number of law enforcement officers died in the line of duty.&nbsp;&nbsp;On Peace Officers Memorial Day and during Police Week, we express our gratitude for these selfless public servants who put themselves in harm&#8217;s way to keep us safe and honor those who lost their lives in the line of duty.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we see a rise in gun violence and other violent crimes, it is critical that we fund law enforcement with the resources and training they need to do their jobs safely and effectively.&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why the American Rescue Plan provided $350 billion that cities, States, counties, and tribes can use to hire more police officers and invest in proven strategies like community violence intervention, youth programming, and other supportive services.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also why my proposed 2023 budget more than doubles funding for effective community policing through the Community Oriented Policing Services Hiring Program.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, my budget increases support for the United States Marshals and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, so they can apprehend fugitives and fight illegal gun trafficking.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gun violence not only affects community members, it also targets law enforcement officers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Last month at the White&nbsp;House,&nbsp;surrounded by law enforcment, community leaders, and families who have lost loved ones to gun violence, we announced that&nbsp;the Department of Justice is reining in the proliferation of &#8220;ghost guns&#8221; &#8212; privately-made firearms without serial numbers that are increasingly showing up on our streets and being used to attack law enforcement officers and members of the public.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Administration is also committed to supporting programs that protect the physical safety of our law enforcement &#8212; more bulletproof vests, active shooter trainings, and early warnings of threats targeting officers.&nbsp;&nbsp;We must also do more to protect our officers&#8217; mental health and emotional well-being.&nbsp;&nbsp;Suicide and COVID-19 were among the leading causes of death for law enforcement officers in 2021.&nbsp;&nbsp;Last November, I was proud to sign into law three bills that extend critical peer counseling and mental health resources for officers, expand eligibility and benefits for first responders disabled in the line of duty, and protect Federal law enforcement serving abroad.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our officers swear an oath to protect us, and we owe them the same pledge.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must not abandon our streets or accept the false choice between public safety and equal justice.&nbsp;&nbsp;The solution is not to defund our police.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is to make our streets more secure through policing that treats everyone with dignity and respect.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is to provide officers with the resources, tools, and training they need to keep our neighborhoods safe.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During Police Week, let us demonstrate our appreciation for the unsung heroes who nobly wear the badge and put their lives at risk to protect people each and every day.&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us honor the brave officers whose bright futures were cut short in the line of duty.&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us come together to help police be the partners and protectors our communities and our Nation need for a safer, more just America.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By a joint resolution approved October 1, 1962, as amended (76 Stat. 676), and by Public Law 103-322, as amended (36 U.S.C. 136-137), the President has been authorized and requested to designate May 15 of each year as &#8220;Peace Officers Memorial Day&#8221; and the week in which it falls as &#8220;Police Week.&#8221;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim May 15, 2022, as Peace Officers Memorial Day and May 15 through May 21, 2022, as Police Week.&nbsp;&nbsp;I call upon all Americans to observe these events with appropriate ceremonies and activities and salute our Nation&#8217;s brave law enforcement officers and remember their peace officer brothers and sisters who have given their last full measure of devotion in the line of duty.&nbsp;&nbsp;I also call on the Governors of the United States and its Territories, and appropriate officials of all units of government, to direct that the flag be flown at half-staff on Peace Officers Memorial Day.&nbsp;&nbsp;I further encourage all Americans to display the flag at half-staff from their homes and businesses on that day.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this<br>thirteenth day of May, in the year of our Lord two&nbsp;thousand&nbsp;twenty-two, and of the Independence of the United&nbsp;States of&nbsp;America the two&nbsp;hundred and forty-sixth.<br>&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>President Biden also highlights $10 billion in American Rescue Plan funding already committed to public safety and violence prevention and praises those states, cities, and rural counties that have answered his call to action.</em></p>



<p>President Biden believes that Americans deserve to feel safe no matter where they live, and he is committed to using every tool at his disposal to fight violent crime. As the cornerstone of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/23/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-comprehensive-strategy-to-prevent-and-respond-to-gun-crime-and-ensure-public-safety/">comprehensive gun crime reduction agenda</a>&nbsp;he issued in June 2021, President Biden called on cities and states to dedicate American Recue Plan state and local funding to proven strategies that will make our communities safer –&nbsp;including by putting more police officers on the beat for accountable community policing, expanding evidence-based community violence intervention programs, and preventing crime by making our neighborhoods stronger with more educational and economic opportunities.<br><br>Today, President Biden is announcing that $10 billion in American Rescue Plan funds have been committed to public safety – including at least $6.5 billion in State and Local funds committed by more than half of states and more than 300 communities across the country, who have answered the President’s call.&nbsp;Along with ongoing state and local support from the Justice Department, American Rescue Plan investments made 2021&nbsp;among the largest single-year commitments&nbsp;of federal resources for state and local law enforcement and public safety on record.<br><br>This American Rescue Plan funding has been a vital lifeline to communities around the country, who have been able to invest in public safety at a time of tremendous state, local, and county budget uncertainty because of the pandemic.&nbsp;Before the American Rescue Plan passed, the Menino Survey found that 27% of mayors anticipated making significant cuts to their police budgets and services.&nbsp;<br><br>The American Rescue Plan has enabled these mayors and other state and local leaders to shore up their budgets and invest in public safety. Unfortunately, every Republican in Congress voted against the American Rescue Plan public safety funding for cities and rural counties across the country.<br><br>While Congressional Republicans try to pull back this funding,&nbsp;<strong>President Biden is today renewing his call for communities to invest more American Rescue Plan funding in strategies to make our communities safer and to deploy as many dollars as possible before the summer months when many communities historically experience a seasonal increase in violent crime.</strong>&nbsp;This renewed call to action comes as the Treasury Department is releasing the second tranche of support for state and local governments.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>$10 Billion in Already Planned ARP Investments in Public Safety &amp; Violence Prevention as President Biden Calls for Increased Investment:</strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>$6.5 billion in State and Local Fiscal Recovery Fund investments over the past year</strong>, by over 300 communities and more than half of states,&nbsp;including:<br><ul><li><strong>$1 billion in bonuses for front-line public safety workers</strong>&nbsp;to help recruit and retain these public servants.</li><li><strong>Over $2 billion to prevent crime and ease the burden on police</strong>, including community violence interventions, crisis responders, and substance use disorder and mental health services.</li><li><strong>Nearly $1 billion&nbsp;to reduce domestic violence</strong>&nbsp;with immediate crisis intervention, health supports and safety for victims of domestic violence</li><li><strong>Over $350 million in job training</strong>&nbsp;and other assistance to help formerly incarcerated individuals successfully reenter society and provide at-risk teens and young adults with meaningful job opportunities in the summer and during the year</li><li><strong>$450 million in public safety technology and equipment&nbsp;</strong>– like new police cars, upgraded radio systems, body-worn cameras, and gunshot detection systems&nbsp;</li><li><strong>$600 million to help clear court backlogs and support victims of crime&nbsp;</strong><br></li></ul></li><li><strong>Over $1 billion</strong>&nbsp;in proposed ARP investments in public safety have been documented this budget season. This understates the potential for new American Rescue Plan commitments to public safety. Indeed, for cities and counties, the numbers announced today reflect only the investments reported through 2021.&nbsp;<br></li><li><strong>$1.2 billion Medicaid Mobile Crisis Intervention Services</strong>&nbsp;– police departments are too often overburdened due to lack of crisis response support for people experiencing behavioral health crises. That’s why the American Rescue Plan included $1.2 billion to fund mobile crisis intervention units staffed with mental health professionals and trained peers.&nbsp;<br></li><li><strong>$1 billion Family Violence Prevention and Services Program&nbsp;</strong>to reduce domestic violence with immediate crisis intervention, health supports, and safety.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Examples of How Specific Communities Are Leveraging American Rescue Plan Funds to Shore Up Their Budgets and Make Our Communities Safer</strong><br>Today, President Biden will meet with mayors, police chiefs, and community violence intervention leaders who represent the following communities:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><strong>Houston’s One Safe Houston Plan – reducing crime in first 100 days: </strong>Mayor Sylvester Turner and Police Chief Troy Finner will describe the $52 million ARP plan to reduce violence, with $32 million in mental health and domestic violence response and victim service efforts, $11 million in police overtime (an additional 125 officers per day in areas of the most violent crime), $3 million for a new community violence intervention and prevention program, $1 million for a gun buyback initiative, $1.5 million for forensic science backlog assistance, $2 million for additional park rangers for park safety, and $1 million for a community reentry program.<br></li><li><strong>Kansas City, Missouri: Making Fiscal Room to Hire Up to 150 New Police Officers: </strong>Mayor Quinton Lucas and Police Chief Joe Mabin will discuss leveraging ARP funds to avoid public safety cuts and layoffs to and invest $10 million for new police radios, communication across departments, and how they are working toward providing hazard pay to police officers. The ARP was directly responsible for enabling the fiscal space for Kansas City to be able to hire up to 150 police officers, increase pay for officers and civilian staff, and budget $12.4 million for the Violent Crimes Division and $6.6 million for the communications unit and increased pay for 911 call-takers.<br></li><li><strong>Tampa, Florida: Avoiding Cuts in Public Safety and Investing in New Police Vehicles and Major Modernization of Fire Rescue: </strong>Mayor Jane Castor, a 31-year serving police officer and the city’s first woman to serve as police chief, and Police Chief Mary O’Connor will discuss the American Rescue Plan’s help in avoiding cutbacks of nearly $10 million in public safety while investing in police mental and behavioral health unit, body-worn cameras and new police vehicles. Tampa is also investing $13 million in a major modernization of Tampa Fire &amp; Rescue, including new rescue and fire vehicles, increased staffing during peak times, and fire station renovations. <br> </li><li><strong><strong>Detroit, Michigan: Increasing police patrols and expanding mental health response and community violence programs: </strong></strong>Mayor Mike Duggan and Detroit Police Chief James White began using ARP funds for public safety starting in July, 2021 and are continuing to expand public safety initiatives, with 6 primary strategies, totaling over $110 million. Investments include funds for an updated police training facility, $30 million for enhanced police patrols, $11 million for expanded mental health co-response, $12 million for community outreach gun violence prevention programs, $7 million for gunshot detection technology, $5 million for body cameras, and $8 million for firehouse expansion.<br></li><li><strong>Tulsa, Oklahoma: Police officer recruitment and hiring bonuses, new equipment and improved court processes. </strong>Tulsa Mayor G. T Bynum will share how the city has used ARP funding to provide $3,000 stipends for Academy Police Officer hires – with $2,000 at the beginning and $1,000 at the end of the Academy training. The city is also investing $7 million in body camera replacement and the police air support unit, as well as $6.5 million to reform and speed the court process. Finally, the city is investing in a new family safety center to reduce domestic violent crime. <br></li><li><strong>Baton Rouge, Louisiana: Investing in new police cars, increasing community policing, and innovative community violence interruption strategies. </strong>Baton Rouge Police Chief Murphy Paul, who is part of the White House’s Community Violence Intervention Collaborative, discussed the city’s major public safety investments, including $8 million to replace patrol and other vehicles, $3.3 million to implement gun violence reduction strategies and increase community policing, and $1.8 million for technology investments such as automated license plate readers.<br></li><li><strong>Toledo, Ohio: Funding training for a second cohort of new police recruits for the first time and plans for 100 new officers in the next few years. </strong>Toledo Mayor Wade Kapszukiewicz is leveraging ARP funds to not only avoid cutbacks and layoffs but used the additional resources to create a path to hiring 100 new police officers and invested $2.3 million in gun violence reduction strategies, including a violence interrupter program and other programs addressing root causes of violence, focused on neighborhoods with highest instances of gun violence. American Rescue Plan funds have allowed, for the first time ever, the city has funding to deploy not just one but two cohorts of new police officers, as it works to expand its police force. The city is also investing in gunshot detection technology and safety camera investments to tackle public safety issues.<br></li><li><strong>Mercer County, Pennsylvania: Nearly $12 million for a county-wide radio system and improved 911 system. </strong>Mercer County includes several rural towns, the largest having a population of just 18,000. The County Commissioner Timothy M. McGonigle will share the county’s nearly $12 million investment to design, purchase, and install a county-wide radio system to connect E-911, police, fire, and ambulance services.<br></li><li><strong>Milwaukee, Wisconsin: Bolstering Expanding Violence Intervention and Summer Youth Employment:</strong> From Governor Evers’ $100 million statewide anti-violence strategy, Milwaukee is receiving $8.4 million to match the city’s commitment for advancing a public health approach to violence prevention, that includes building an unarmed community response system that integrates licensed mental health clinicians into Milwaukee’s 911 center, and provides job training at Milwaukee County House of Correction, while using the city’s own ARP funds to invest in summer jobs for up to 1,500 young people. Of the $100M that Evers allocated, $10M has been allocated to establish a statewide violence prevention fund to be administered by the Medical College of Wisconsin. Communities across the state will be able to apply for funds for community-based violence Intervention programs to address gun violence, domestic violence, and suicides.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Appendix: 40+ Additional Examples of Cities, Counties, and States Are Using American Rescue Plan Funding&nbsp;</strong><br></p>
