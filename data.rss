<p>3:19 P.M. EDT</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Hello, Cleveland!&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>(The orchestra concludes playing “Hail to the Chief.”)</p>



<p>Thank you to the orchestra.&nbsp; Thank you very much.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>Well, let me start off by saying &#8212; I’d get in trouble with my mother, were she here, if I didn’t say, “Excuse my back when I’m speaking.”&nbsp; I apologize.&nbsp; Number one.</p>



<p>AUDIENCE MEMBER:&nbsp; (Inaudible.)</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; You have my &#8212; (laughs) &#8212;</p>



<p>Hello, Cleveland!&nbsp; Before I begin, though, I want to make one serious comment about the shooting and the death of Jayland Walker.&nbsp; The Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division; the FBI Field Office in Akron, Ohio; and the local U.S. Attorney’s Office are closely monitoring and reviewing what happened.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The FBI continues to coordinate with state and local partners to provide resources and specialized skill.&nbsp; If the evidence reveals potential violations of federal criminal statutes, the Justice Department will take the appropriate action.&nbsp; And I just want you to know what’s going to happen.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>And now &#8212; now for today’s program.&nbsp; Thank you, Bill, for that introduction and for the welcome on behalf of the Ironworkers Local 17 here in Cleveland.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ironworkers were with me the first time I ran, as a 29-year-old kid, for the Senate.&nbsp; And you’re all crazy.&nbsp; (Laughter.)</p>



<p>I remember you got a guy named Tommy Schranck who was the president of a Local in Delaware.&nbsp; And he said, “Let’s go out and meet some of the guys and women.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>We went out to a buil- &#8212; a construction site.&nbsp; We went up a makeshift elevator.&nbsp; We went up 13 floors.&nbsp; They’re sitting on 18-inch beams, eating their lunch.&nbsp; I’m thinking to myself, “My God, these guys are supporting me.”&nbsp; But they’re the guys I grew up with.</p>



<p>You know, the people you heard speak earlier today &#8212; and I apologize, I’m going to repeat some of what they said.&nbsp; But, you know, we all come from the neighborhood.&nbsp; We all come from &#8212; no, I mean it.&nbsp; I &#8212; I was born in Scranton, Pennsylvania, which was a union town, mostly coalmine union town &#8212; a lot more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>My great-grandfather was a &#8212; worked in the mines, was a mining engineer.&nbsp; And everybody &#8212; everybody there &#8212; there was only one word you heard most often in my family.&nbsp; Not a joke.&nbsp; Most important word wasn’t “unions,” it was “dignity.”&nbsp; “Dignity.”&nbsp; Everyone is entitled to be treated with dignity.</p>



<p>My dad &#8212; (applause) &#8212; then we moved to a little town &#8212; when coal died, we moved to a town called Claymont, Delaware, just across the line in &#8212; from Pennsylvania, where the Delaware River bends.</p>



<p>And, you know, you used to have over 6,000 &#8212; 6,000 steelworkers &#8212; were steel.&nbsp; It’s all gone now.&nbsp; All of it, gone.&nbsp; Used to be a company town, literally.&nbsp; The hills were all company stores, company &#8212; company buildings.&nbsp; But it’s gone.&nbsp; And the union movement began to just crumble in Delaware and in Claymont.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And my dad never belonged to a union, but I say this at the front end: My dad was a salesperson.&nbsp; And he came down from Scranton when coal died.&nbsp; He wasn’t a coalminer, but he worked in sales up there.</p>



<p>And I’ll never forget: We lived in a &#8212; we lived in a three-bedroom, split-level home, like a lot of suburban areas developing in the early ‘50s and mid-‘50s.&nbsp; And there were, I think, 38, 40 homes.&nbsp; And they were &#8212; and we had four kids in the family and a grandpop living with us and mom and dad.</p>



<p>And the walls were thin.&nbsp; And my dad &#8212; one night, I could tell he was really restless.&nbsp; I could hear him and sort of a &#8212; not banging, but leaning up against the wall in the room &#8212; my room.</p>



<p>Next morning, I asked my &#8212; my dad had an expression.&nbsp; He said, “Joey, you never complain and never explain.&nbsp; Just get up.&nbsp; Just get up.”</p>



<p>And I was wondering what was wrong.&nbsp; And I asked my mom.&nbsp; She said, “The company says no pensions.&nbsp; No pensions.”</p>



<p>And so, you know, a lot of you come from families like mine &#8212; a lot of the people who stood behind me.&nbsp; Richie Neal from the state of Massachusetts &#8212; (applause) &#8212; he is, as my uncle would say &#8212; Richie is &#8212; he is union from belt buckle to shoe sole, man.&nbsp; (Laughter.)</p>



<p>And &#8212; but all the folks you heard speak today care about it, because we know what it’s like to be deprived of your dignity.&nbsp; We know what it’s like to have a father or a mother have to put their head down when they know they can’t afford a thing for their kid that they need, whether it’s a prescription or whether it’s just plain being able to go off to school.</p>



<p>And the point I want to make is this: We all understand this.&nbsp; And when I ran for office this time &#8212; and I’ve been a union supporter for my whole career.&nbsp; But I made a promise.&nbsp; I mean it sincerely, and Marty knows this.&nbsp; I guaranteed, when the &#8212; you know, when the Fair Labor Standards Act was passed and &#8212; back in the ‘30s &#8212; and Roosevelt came along, it didn’t say unions were okay.&nbsp; It says we should “encourage” unions.&nbsp; Encourage unions.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>Because when unions do well, everybody does well.&nbsp; Everybody does well.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Not a joke.&nbsp; Not a joke.</p>



<p>So here’s the deal.&nbsp; The deal is quite simple.&nbsp; When I ran, I was criticized for the basis upon which I ran.&nbsp; I said I’m running for three reasons. One, to restore the soul of America &#8212; the decency and honor of this country.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; And, two, to rebuild the backbone of the country.&nbsp; The backbone of the country are the working women and men, the middle class.&nbsp; And, you know, there’s a middle class for one reason: American unions.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; That&#8217;s the only reason there&#8217;s a middle class.&nbsp; Not a joke.&nbsp; That&#8217;s a fact.&nbsp; Not a joke.</p>



<p>And when the middle class does well, everybody does well &#8212; people have a way up, and the wealthy still do very well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so, folks, the third reason I ran was to unify the country &#8212; to unify it.&nbsp; That&#8217;s been the harder part of it right now.&nbsp; No, I&#8217;m serious.&nbsp; Because we’ve become so divided &#8212; so divided in this.&nbsp; But one thing we were divided on when we ran &#8212; and, you know, I want to thank Mayor Bibb for the passport into the city.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>But we &#8212; we were divided on the question we&#8217;re celebrating today.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, folks, how about actually having a union guy as Secretary of Labor?&nbsp; Isn&#8217;t that something?&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Thank you, Marty.</p>



<p>And I know we have a fantastic Secretary of Housing and Urban Development: Cleveland&#8217;s own Marcia Fudge.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; She&#8217;s &#8212; she wished she was going to be here.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m also honored to be here with Senator Sherrod Brown, a great champion of working folks.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; He really is.&nbsp; He really is.</p>



<p>And thank you also for the incredible Democratic members of Congress here.&nbsp; Marcy Kaptur &#8212; God love you, Marcy.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; You are the best.&nbsp; She does it all &#8212; unions and foreign policy.&nbsp; And for- &#8212; and you think I&#8217;m joking.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not joking.&nbsp; She really knows more about foreign policy.&nbsp; She&#8217;s forgotten more than most members of Congress know.&nbsp; (Laughter.)</p>



<p>And, Shontel Brown, just remember me when you&#8217;re president, okay?&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; All right?&nbsp; Congratulations.</p>



<p>Look, and Richie Neal is not only a strong, strong union supporter and been a great supporter of this legislation, but he&#8217;s chairman of the most powerful committee in the United States Congress, the House Ways and Means Committee &#8212; the guys with the money.&nbsp; The guys with money.&nbsp; And he&#8217;s led on labored issue &#8212; labor issues for decades.</p>



<p>You know, while they couldn&#8217;t be here, I also want to thank Senator Tim Ryan &#8212; future Senator Tim Ryan &#8212; (applause) &#8212; and Senator Patty Murray of the state of Washington for their incredible work on this legislation.</p>



<p>With everyone&#8217;s leadership and with their votes and, most of all, with the unrelenting commitment of labor and all of you, this historic day is made possible.&nbsp; And it really is historic.</p>



<p>This was $90 billion, okay?&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; But it&#8217;s small in comparison to the bailouts of businesses and major corporations and banks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, folks, I&#8217;m here today to talk about the issue that affects every single American and their retirement.&nbsp; People around the country wake up every day wondering whether they&#8217;ve saved enough to provide for themselves and their families before they stop working &#8212; work at a job that provides basic dignity, a good middle-class job you can raise a family on, a job that provides a dignified retirement and will give you peace of mind.</p>



<p>Think of all the people &#8212; and many of you went to bed at night putting your head on the pillow and saying, “Am I going to be all right?&nbsp; Is my family going to be all right?&nbsp; Is my wife or my husband or my child, are they going to be okay?”</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a dignified retirement with your spouse in the home in your community you worked and lived for your whole life.&nbsp; But the reality is for so many people: The goalposts keep moving.&nbsp; Unfor- &#8212; that’s probably Trump calling me.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; I hear &#8212; I hear that sound there.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, this happens to people who need it most: working people in this country.&nbsp; A lot of politicians like to talk about how they&#8217;re going to do something about it.&nbsp; Well, I&#8217;m here today to say we&#8217;ve done something about it.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; And I&#8217;ve kept their promise.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I campaigned to restore the backbone of this country &#8212; the middle class and unions &#8212; because I know this: The middle class built American unions, built the middle class today.&nbsp; I&#8217;m keeping the promise &#8212; one of the most significant achievement union workers and retirees have received in over 50 years.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s not hyperbole.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>For years and years, union workers have been driving trucks from factories to stores, bagging your groceries, constructing the buildings, bridges, roads we need, and so much more.&nbsp; The ironworkers, bricklayers, carpenters, laborers, plumbers, truck drivers, musicians, I might add.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Food workers and so much more.</p>



<p>And with each paycheck you earn, their employers put money into their pension plans.&nbsp; These workers work hard today to secure a retirement tomorrow.&nbsp; That’s what it’s all about.</p>



<p>Now, a lot of businesses aren’t able or willing to run their own pension plans.&nbsp; And in some industries, workers are employed by several different employers over the course of a year or longer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, we see that in transportation, construction, and entertainment.&nbsp; So working with the union that represents their employees, businesses in the same industry often come together to form what’s called multi-employer union &#8212; and I know you know this, but people listening to this on television may not know this &#8212; pension plans that serve 11 million Americans across the country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And to make sure these pensions are managed responsibly and to protect the participating workers and retirees, the federal government oversees and insures the plans.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But we’ve seen the risk of millions of workers face as they watch their hard-earned pensions turn into broken promises.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We saw it before the pandemic and the economic crisis that followed.&nbsp; Millions of retirees were at risk of losing their retirement security, through no fault of their own, based on conditions and unrelenting attacks on unions that were taking place.</p>



<p>Two hundred multiemployer pension plans for 2 to 3 million workers and retirees were going insolvent.&nbsp; What that means is to those 2 or 3 million workers &#8212; they faced painful cuts to the benefits they counted on and for the dignified security of retirement.</p>



<p>You just heard from Bill what it’s like to work 30, 40, 50 years &#8212; working hard every day, doing everything to provide for your family; track every dollar of that paycheck for groceries, the mortgage, and, hopefully, for a family vacation maybe one day; knowing when it’s time to retire, your pension you earned will be there; knowing that together with your Social Security benefits, that pension will continue a good middle-class life for you in retirement.&nbsp; For some, just &#8212; my dad used to say, “Just a little peace of mind.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>But for folks at home, imagine losing 50 or 60 percent of that pension through absolutely no fault of your own.&nbsp; Imagine what it does financially and emotionally, what it does to your dignity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Also here is Davey Grubbs, a retired Teamsters truck driver from North Carolina who faced nearly 70 percent cut in his pension.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And now also joining me today is Rita Lewis.&nbsp; Where are you, Rita?&nbsp; Rita is here somewhere, I&#8217;m told.&nbsp; She stepped out.&nbsp; I don’t blame her.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; You know, she&#8217;s Butch’s widow.&nbsp; And their anniversary is coming up in a couple of days.&nbsp; Childhood sweethearts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Butch was a ballplayer drafted by the Pittsburgh Pirates out of high school, but he enlisted in the United States Army instead.&nbsp; Special Forces Army Ranger.&nbsp; Served in Vietnam.&nbsp; Earned, like my son, the Bronze Star.&nbsp; My son did not earn the Purple Heart, but &#8212; and the Purple Heart.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Came back home to Rita, settled in Cincinnati.&nbsp; Became a trucker represented by the Teamsters, and then president of his local.&nbsp; Known as an honorable, honest, and decent labor leader.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Butch faced severe cuts in his pension, and he became a fierce advocate for protecting the pensions of his fellow workers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Butch died more than 16 years &#8212; 6 years ago.&nbsp; And Rita has carried on his legacy ever since.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And with the &#8212; with &#8212; and with the Democrats in Congress, I might add, and Marty Walsh’s leadership, we brought the Butch &#8212; he &#8212; we fought for the Butch Lewis Act to protect pensions for millions of workers and retirees.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a candidate for President, I argued for its passage and promised, when it passed, I would sign it.&nbsp; And that’s the promise I&#8217;ve kept when I &#8212; I included the Butch Lewis Act in the American Rescue Plan. (Applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, multi-employer plans will remain solvent for decades to come at least until &#8212; guaranteed until 2051.&nbsp; These retirees &#8212; those retirees who lost their benefits will have them restored retroactively.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; We turned a promised broken into a promised kept.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It matters to workers.&nbsp; It matters to their families.&nbsp; It matters to the country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You all remember what the economy was like when I was elected: a country in a pandemic with no real plans how to get out of it &#8212; millions of people out of their jobs, families in cars &#8212; remember? &#8212; backed up for literally miles, waiting for a box of food to be put in their trunk.&nbsp; Just a &#8212; a box of food to be put in their trunk because they didn’t have enough to eat.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The previous administration lost more jobs on its watch than any administration since Herbert Hoover<a></a> &#8212; that’s a fact &#8212; all based on failed trickle-down economics that benefitted the wealthiest Americans and hit the middle class and working people the hardest.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>But we came in with a fundamentally different economic vision: an economy that grows from the bottom up and the middle out.&nbsp; It’s good for everyone, because when the middle class does well, the poor have a ladder up and the wealthy still do very well.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>And that’s why we designed the American Rescue Plan based on &#8212; based on the belief that a recovery should help all Americans prosper, a belief that working &#8212; building power and unions are good for workers and for the economy, a plan that led to the most jobs created in the first period of a presidency than any time in over &#8212; in all American history.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>And we’ve seen in the past how economic crisis can leave so many Americans in tough straits for years, sometimes for the rest of their lives.&nbsp; Economists call it the “scarring effect” &#8212; the lasting bad effects of economic hardship, including folks unemployed for a long time.</p>



<p>Remember, when we started this, a lot of people were equally as qualified, but they’d been unemployed for 8, 10, 12 months; they wouldn’t even be considered.&nbsp; Two people put in an application &#8212; the person may be more qualified but unemployed &#8212; out of &#8212; out of work for longer.&nbsp; It’s called the “scarring effect” &#8212; people not able to get back to work.&nbsp; Period.&nbsp; But we changed that.&nbsp; And young people who faced a weak labor market &#8212; they’re back.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Losing a big part of your income late in life, that’s a scar, though, that doesn’t heal.&nbsp; Well, not this time.&nbsp; Long-term unemployment and youth unemployment dropped at a record pace.&nbsp; With today’s actions, millions of workers will have the dignified retirement they earned and they deserve.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>And, folks, let’s be honest: I’d love to tell you, everyone, that &#8212; here that this policy that honors hard work and ensures dignified retirement was universally supported, regardless of political party.&nbsp; But this is an important point and this really matters: Unfortunately, that’s not the case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Not one single Republican &#8212; not &#8212; no, this is &#8212; I mean, this is what I’m talking about.  Not one single solitary Republican voted for the Butch Lewis Act or this legislation.<br><br>AUDIENCE:  Booo &#8212;<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:  And, folks &#8212; and, folks, I can tell you, those of us in the &#8212; were &#8212; I was in the Congress a long time, and the people are still in the Congress &#8212; there’s ones who wanted to, but they’re afraid to &#8212; afraid to &#8212; because the Trumpers would literally take them out.  Not a joke.  That’s how bad it’s gotten.  We’ve got to change it.  We’ve got to change it.<br><br>In fact, when this bill was moving through Congress, Republicans called it &#8212; called these pensions, quote, “rat holes.”  That was their &#8212; no, that was their phrase on the floor &#8212; “rat holes.”</p>



<p>Who do they think they are?  Who do they think you are, for God’s sake?  And my predecessor had the chance to act, but he didn’t have the commitment to you or the courage to stand up to his own party to get things done, dismissing and ignoring the forgotten people he promised to help.  Remember how he was going to help working-class folks? </p>



<p>But tax cut for the wealthiest Americans &#8212; he had no trouble passing that.&nbsp; They passed a $2 trillion tax cut, not a penny of which was paid for.&nbsp; Increased the debt by $2 trillion.&nbsp; The vast majority of people making the top 1 percent of income, the biggest corporations and their &#8212; their biggest cheerleaders of that two thou- &#8212; $2 trillion tax cut.&nbsp; Again, disproportionately benefitted the wealthiest &#8212; the wealthiest Americans.<br><br>Protecting a system in which, for example, the 55 of the largest Fortune 500 companies in America paid zero in taxes.&nbsp; Zero.</p>



<p><br>They made &#8212; they made $40 billion.&nbsp; Didn’t pay a single penny.<br><br>The party that choose to make life more comfortable for the already comfortable disparage and oppose retirement security for working people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And now, when Republicans actually do offer a plan &#8212; and they finally &#8212; we &#8212; you know, I’m not joking.&nbsp; Ask yourself this question: What is the Republican platform going into this campaign?<br><br>AUDIENCE:&nbsp; (Inaudible.)<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; No, no.&nbsp; I’m not &#8212; I’m being deadly earnest.&nbsp; I’m not trying to be poli- &#8212; just &#8212; just a fact.<br><br>Well, they have a guy who is the &#8212; Rick Scott from Florida, who heads up the Republican Campaign Committee.&nbsp; He put out the plan.&nbsp; What does that plan do?&nbsp; It makes the tax system less fair by giving &#8212; wanting to tax everybody making under $100,000 significantly more, on average &#8212; a lot more money.&nbsp; It actually raises taxes on those working families because he thinks you don’t pay enough in taxes already.<br><br>No, no.&nbsp; Not a joke.&nbsp; I can &#8212; I should have brought along the actual copy of the plan, but go online and get &#8212; no, for real.&nbsp; It’s been published.&nbsp; They published it.&nbsp; They think we’re freeloaders.<br><br>But he’s not &#8212; but he’s got a problem with a tax code that allows billionaires &#8212; none at all, no problem &#8212; trillion and billionaires in America &#8212; there’s 789 or thereabouts.&nbsp; You know what their average federal income tax they pay?&nbsp; Eight percent.<br><br>Every one of you have a job pays more than 8 percent &#8212; every single one of you.&nbsp; If you’re a cop, a teacher, a firefighter, union worker, you probably pay two to three times that.&nbsp; Now, after refusing to protect your pension, they’re going after your Social Security.<br><br>Look, I would have thought, had I not seen it on paper and heard them talk about it, that I was making this up.&nbsp; Not a joke.<br><br><br></p>



<p>His big idea is put Social Security on the chopping block every five years.&nbsp; That is: Every five years, Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid have to be reauthorized or they go out of existence.</p>



<p>Social Security you paid in from the day you started working.&nbsp; It’s your other pension.&nbsp; You paid into it every single paycheck.&nbsp; You earned it.&nbsp; It’s your money, just like your pension.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And he adds in Medicare and Medicaid for the chopping block every five years.&nbsp; Unless Congress explicitly votes to extend those programs, they go away.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You know how they work the rules in the Senate.&nbsp; The ability to slow this up and keep that from happening is real.</p>



<p>You know how hard it is to get anything done in Congress.&nbsp; Imagine what it would mean if Republicans had their way.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Look, the ultra-MAGA Republicans &#8212; Congress is deciding every five years whether the &#8212; your promise of your hard-earned Medicare and Social Security would be continued or discontinued or slashed.&nbsp; It’s shameful.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But Rick Scott is not alone.&nbsp; Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina is talking &#8212;</p>



<p>AUDIENCE:&nbsp; Booo &#8212;</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; No, he has a proposal to cut Social Security.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And by the way, I might note, parenthetically: As President &#8212; the first year I was President, I cut the federal deficit by $350 billion.&nbsp; And do you know how much I cut it this year?&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Cut &#8212; cut this year &#8212; by the end of September, I will have cut the federal budget by $1 trillion 400 billion &#8212; cut the deficit.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, when they start talking about you being big spenders, just point them to that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But here’s the point: Republicans are talking about privatizing social security &#8212; privatizing social sec- &#8212;</p>



<p>AUDIENCE:&nbsp; Booo &#8212;</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; No, I &#8212; this is not a jo- &#8212; I mean, you know, we used to hear this stuff and think they didn’t mean it, but they’ve written it down.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The senator from Wisconsin, Ron Johnson, promised again that if they regain power, they’re going to get rid of the Affordable Care Act.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What does that mean?&nbsp; It means that if any of you who have a preexisting condition will automatically lose insurance.&nbsp; Because the insurance companies are able to &#8212; right now, because of the Affordable Care Act, no one can be denied insurance because they have a preexisting condition.&nbsp; It’s the only thing that &#8212;</p>



<p>AUDIENCE MEMBER:&nbsp; (Inaudible.)</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; &#8212; no.&nbsp; And by the &#8212; we’re talking 90 million people with preexisting conditions gone.&nbsp; Gone.</p>



<p>They tried to do it about 17 times last &#8212; under Trump.&nbsp; We were able to stop them.</p>



<p>But, folks, this is a different world.&nbsp; I don’t know where they live.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; No, I’m not joking.&nbsp; That’s why elections have consequences, and that’s why they matter, and that’s why what we’re doing here is so important.</p>



<p>Let me close with this: We’ve made incredible cogress [sic] on the &#8212; progress on the economy from where we were a year and half ago.&nbsp; We got a long way to go because of inflation and because of the &#8212; I call it “the Putin tax increase” &#8212; “Putin” because of gasoline and all that grain he’s keeping from being able to get to the market.</p>



<p>Now I’m fighting like hell to lower costs on the things that you talk about around your kitchen table.&nbsp; My dad used to say, “At the end of the day, it’s just, when you sit at that table, do you have enough money to pay for everything you need?”&nbsp; Not a lot over.&nbsp; Do you have enough money to pay for everything you need?</p>



<p><a>While Republicans do nothing <s>to</s> [but] obstruct our efforts to lower your gas taxes </a>&#8212; I’ve proposed that and I’ve asked the Congress to eliminate the federal gas tax for the next &#8212; as long as this crisis goes on; to lower food prices, lower healthcare costs; hopefully soon, lower your prescription drug costs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By the way, you’ve got a &#8212; you got a Republican leader in the United States Senate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I was able to work out something with Intel.&nbsp; They’re going to provide for over 7,000 jobs in this state, out of Columbus &#8212; (applause) &#8212; making computer chips.</p>



<p><a>Well, there’s another bill that, if we get it passed &#8212; and my guys are working like hell to pass it &#8212; it’ll create another $100 <s>million</s> [billion] in investments in Ohio, creating more jobs.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;</a></p>



<p>But do you know what?&nbsp; You know what the Republican leader is saying?&nbsp; If, in fact, we pass the law that says Medicare can negotiate drug prices like they can for the military; if, in fact, we pass the plan that says we’re going to raise taxes on multi-millionaires so they start paying their fair share, then he’s going to block the passage of the legislation that will provide for another $100 billion invested in this state.</p>



<p>Folks, this is not right.&nbsp; This is not right.&nbsp; And that’s why this election is going to be so darn important.&nbsp; The key is that we just have to remember who built this country.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; I know I remember.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p>Tomorrow, I’ll be awarding the highest honor that can be given to a civilian, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, to our dear friend the late Rich Trumka, who fought so damn hard to protect &#8212; (applause) &#8212; for the protection of these pensions.&nbsp; He once said unions &#8212; quote, “We do America’s work.”&nbsp; Unions do America’s work.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This Fourth of July, let’s remember who &#8212; who is the backbone of this country.&nbsp; It’s you, the American worker.&nbsp; I promised you I would be the most pro-labor, pro-union, pro-worker&nbsp;President in our history.&nbsp; And there’s another promise I am going to be keeping as well.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; So, let me tell you something: There’s no other place I want to be than right here with the workers in this room and the workers that built America.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>I see you, I hear you, and I’ll always have your back.&nbsp; I promise.&nbsp; God bless you.&nbsp; And may God protect our troops.&nbsp; Thank you, thank you, thank you.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Biden Administration will facilitate air shipment of over 3.1 million 8-ounce bottle equivalents of Kendamil infant formula on July 17 and 22</em></p>



<p><br>Today, President Biden is announcing that his Administration is sourcing a flight, facilitated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), for Operation Fly Formula to transport Kendamil baby formula from England to New York, NY via flights on July 17 and 22 respectively. These two deliveries will include in total approximately 200,000 pounds of Kendamil EU Classic First Infant Milk Stage 1 and Kendamil EU Organic First Infant Milk Stage 1, the equivalent of approximately 3.1 million 8-ounce bottles. The product will be available at Target stores. Parents and Pediatricians can learn more about Kendamil infant formula at <a href="https://us.kendamil.com">https://us.kendamil.com</a>  and compare its nutritional content per 100kcal with other leading formula brands at <a href="https://us.kendamil.com/pages/compare-kendamil">https://us.kendamil.com/pages/compare-kendamil</a>.</p>



<p>In May, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced that the agency is exercising enforcement discretion so that Kendamil can export additional infant formula into the U.S., including&nbsp;Kendamil EU Classic First Infant Milk Stage 1 and Kendamil EU Organic First Infant Milk Stage 1. Kendamil plans to export approximately 58 million 8-ounce bottle equivalents into the U.S. market over the next 6 months.</p>



<p>President Biden launched Operation Fly Formula to speed up the import of infant formula and start getting more formula to stores as soon as possible. Under Operation Fly Formula, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the General Services Administration (GSA), and the Department of Defense (DOD) are partnering to pick up overseas infant formula that meets U.S. health and safety standards, so it can get to store shelves faster. By July 10, Operation Fly Formula will have transported more than 43 million 8-ounce bottle equivalents to the U.S.</p>



<p>In addition, the Biden Administration has taken a number of other important actions to ensure there is enough safe infant formula for families, including invoking the Defense Production Act, entering into a consent agreement between the FDA and Abbott Nutrition to reopen the company’s Sturgis facility, and issuing FDA guidance so that major formula manufacturers can safely import formula that is not currently being produced for the U.S. market. Details of our actions can be found at whitehouse.gov/formula.</p>

<p>Kate Bedingfield, a longtime trusted aide to President Biden and a senior strategist both in the administration and on his winning campaign, will leave the White House in late July to spend more time with her husband and young children after more than 3 straight years of leading his communications team. She first worked for the President as his communications director during his time as Vice President.<br><br>Bedingfield previously served as the Deputy Campaign Manager and Communications Director on the President’s 2020 presidential campaign, playing a leading role advising him on messaging, building his communications and press operations, preparing him for debates and interviews, and devising and executing on strategy as he secured the Democratic nomination faster than any candidate since 2004 and became the first nominee to defeat an incumbent president in almost 30 years. She also represented the campaign on television at key moments, including before and after debates.<br><br>In the White House, Bedingfield continued as the President’s top communications aide and was similarly integral to every major public relations effort while leading the White House Communications Department, ensuring that each part of the team was working to deliver the President’s message and advocate for his agenda.<br><br>“Without Kate Bedingfield’s talent and tenacity, Donald Trump might still be in the White House, the Rescue Plan and the Infrastructure Law might still be unrealized goals, and Ketanji Brown Jackson might not be sitting on the Supreme Court,” <strong>said White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain.</strong> “She has played a huge role in everything the President has achieved – from his second term as Vice President, through the campaign, and since coming to the White House.  Her strategic acumen, intense devotion to the President’s agenda, and fierce work on his behalf are unmatched.  She will continue to remain a critical player in moving the Biden agenda forward from the outside.”<br><br>“From long before we launched the campaign, Kate Bedingfield was a fierce defender of the President and ensured that our message in 2020 and in the White House was consistent with his voice and principles,” <strong>said White House Senior Adviser Anita Dunn.</strong> “Her leadership helped us tell the story about the fight Joe Biden is making for the working families of America.  She’ll always be a core member of this family, even as she takes a little time to put her own family first.  We will miss her intelligence, her talent, her sense of humor, and her commitment to the values President Biden fought for as a candidate and fights for every day as president.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Aboard Air Force One<br>En Route Cleveland, Ohio</p>



<p>1:23 P.M. EDT<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  All right.  Hey, everybody.  Okay, so today, the President is traveling to Max <s>South</s> [S.] Hayes High School in Cleveland, Ohio, to announce new protections for millions of workers in multiemployer pension plans thanks to the American Rescue Plan.<br><br>Up to 3 million Americans face significant cuts to their retirement benefits because their investments struggled during economic crisis just during the pandemic or more.  But tha- &#8212; but thanks to the ARP, over 200 multiemployer pension plans will receive special financial assistance and remain solvent through at least 2051 or longer.</p>



<p>The President is strengthening families’ retirement savings while Republican members of Congress, led by Senator Rick Scott, want to threaten it by putting Social Security on the chopping blocks every five years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, the President will be joined today by Secretary of Labor Marty Walsh, Senator Sherrod Brown, ARP Coordinator Gene Sperling, and Cleveland Mayor Justin Bibb, as well as Representative Shontel Brown and Representative Marcy Kaptur.</p>



<p><a>And worth noting, as we are in route to <s>Chicago </s>[Cleveland], there is currently a bipartisan bill in Congress that would supercharge private sector investment in semiconductor manufacturing here at home.&nbsp; </a>The Bipartisan Innovation Act is good for workers, good for business, and good for communities.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s supported by mayors, governors, CEOs, manufacturers, and unions across the country, including the Republican Governor of Ohio, Mike DeWine.</p>



<p>Intel announced that it will invest $20 billion to open semiconductor factories in Ohio, and that could expand to as much as $100 billion if the Bipartisan Innovation Act is passed.</p>



<p>Senator Cornyn is joining Minority Leader McConnell in holding a bipartisan bill hostage that would make more in America in order to protect pharmaceutical companies’ profits.</p>



<p>But we believe we need to do both: increase American manufacturing and strengthen competitive edge against China and lower prescription drug costs.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why we need Congress to pass BIA this summer.</p>



<p>And with that, Aamer.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah, thanks.&nbsp; Has the President had a chance to reach out to the family of the Al Jazeera journalist since the State Department report?&nbsp; Or does he have plans to?</p>



<p>And just secondly, how big of an issue is he going to press this with the Israelis next week on holding someone accountable?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; So I&#8217;m not going to get ahead of a trip or ahead of conversations for a trip that hasn’t yet happened.&nbsp; So I won’t get ahead of that.&nbsp; But we have made very clear that we will continue to work both with Israel and Palestinian Authority to encourage them to bridge this investigation, because we do not want to &#8212; we want to see accountability, which is incredibly important for &#8212; not just for having accountability broadly, but also for the family as well.</p>



<p>So, to your first question, Aamer, I can say that senior American officials at the State Department have been in close touch with Abu Akleh’s fami- &#8212; her family and continue to be.</p>



<p>We again express our deepest condolences to the Abu Akleh family and remain engaged with Israel and, again, the Palestinian Authority on next steps.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just one quick other one.&nbsp; Both Governor Pritzker, on guns in the aftermath of the July 4th shooting, and Gavin Newsom, since Dobbs decision, have become arguably more &#8212; the most outspoken voices of the Democratic Party on both of these very fragile issues in the country.&nbsp; And I&#8217;m sort of wondering: Is there any concern that the President&#8217;s leadership is being overshadowed at this moment when the &#8212; a big part of the American public, including Democrats, that voted for him?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; What was the first part of the question?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, that both Pritzker and Newsom have sort of emerged on guns and on Dobbs, with &#8212; in Newsom’s case &#8212; as the loudest and, you know, most potent voices of the Democratic Party at this point.&nbsp; Where&#8217;s the President?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; The President has been also very loud and also very focused on those two issues.&nbsp; When it comes to gun reform, the President led on that.&nbsp; One of the reasons that he was able to sign a bipartisan gun reform bill right before he left for G7 and NATO was because of his leadership, was because of him being very committed and being very consistent for more than a year, at least as President, talking about what we needed to do in light of this gun violence epidemic that we are currently in.</p>



<p>And let&#8217;s not forget this President has had the most executive actions on gun reform than any other President at this time.&nbsp; And he not only has led as President this past a year and a half, but also as Vice President and as senator &#8212; the very, very first, I would say &#8212; argue &#8212; the gun reform that we saw, or the last gun reform that we saw was 30 years ago, which this President led, which was on banning assault weapons.&nbsp; And so, you know, 30 years later, he was able to sign a gun reform &#8212; a bipartisan gun reform legislation that is now law.</p>



<p>Now, with all of that said, the President believes there is more work to be done.&nbsp; He&#8217;s going to continue to call on more to be done on dealing with this gun violence epidemic.&nbsp; And that does not stop here.&nbsp; And he welcomes &#8212; he welcomes other voices in the Democratic Party, and he welcomes other voices in the Republican Party as well to join him in really dealing with an issue that&#8217;s tearing up communities and families.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karine, is the White House tracking the drama in Boris Johnson&#8217;s government right now?&nbsp; And are you concerned at all about instability in the British government at a time when you&#8217;re working together on Ukraine and other international issues?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; So &#8212; and I&#8217;ve said this before when I&#8217;ve been asked questions about other governments’ elections &#8212; we&#8217;re just not going to comment on another government &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This isn&#8217;t an election though.&nbsp; I’m not talking about an election.</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Well &#8212; nope, you&#8217;re right, this is not an election.&nbsp; But to be clear, we&#8217;re just not going to comment on another government’s democratic process.&nbsp; So we&#8217;re just not going to comment.</p>



<p>Look, our alliance, our partnership with the United Kingdom continues to be strong.&nbsp; And so &#8212; but we&#8217;re not going to comment on their &#8212; kind of their political process</p>



<p>in their own country.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To follow up on guns, does the President or the White House see this latest shooting in Highland Park as another perhaps opportunity to come out and try again to stop or to ban assault weapons?&nbsp; We haven’t heard the President talk about that since this latest shooting.</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Well, I mean, the President first wanted to make sure that the first responders had the space to do what they needed to do, which they have.&nbsp; And he has spoken to that.&nbsp; He wanted to also make sure that &#8212; you know, families and friends are mourning right now, which is incredibly important.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We saw the Vice President in Chicago yesterday.&nbsp; She went to speak at NEA, and she stopped &#8212; she did a &#8212; she did a stop-by to thank the police officers, the first responders, and the work that they have done.&nbsp; So she did that representing, clearly, the administration and the President, which is incredibly important.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Look, the President is going to continue to speak about this.&nbsp; He&#8217;s going to continue to speak about what we &#8212; what else we can do to really deal with gun reform in a real way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He is &#8212; indeed, you know, welcomes and thankful for this bipartisan bill that is now law that he signed right before &#8212; like I said, right before he left for Europe.&nbsp; But the work doesn&#8217;t stop there, and he&#8217;ll continue to speak to that.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karine, on Ohio: You know, Tim Ryan, the Senate candidate, is not joining the President today and neither is the Democratic gubernatorial nominee, Nan Whaley.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I know you listed some people who are, but those are the main statewide candidates.&nbsp; And what does that say about the President&#8217;s clout in Ohio that they&#8217;re &#8212; they&#8217;re not joining him today?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Well, I’ll say this: We&#8217;re in close contact with Congressman Tim Ryan in particular and work with him, and also &#8212; also Nan Whaley.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve worked &#8212; we&#8217;ve worked closely with him on &#8212; just as it relates to Tim Ryan &#8212; on ver- &#8212; on a variety of issues.&nbsp; And he released a statement in strong support of the actions we&#8217;re taking through the American Rescue Plan to protect American retirees.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And though he can&#8217;t be there with us today, one of the things that the President looks forward to is to talk about building an economy around the power and possibilities of working families and providing financial relief to millions of workers in Ohio and the rest of the country.</p>



<p>I just listed out a long list of other elected officials who will be with him on this trip.&nbsp; And so, I think that counts for something as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so, again, Tim Ryan put out &#8212; put out a statement supporting &#8212; supporting his trip, and we&#8217;re in constant communication with (inaudible).</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His (inaudible) rating in Ohio is &#8212; it&#8217;s pretty low.&nbsp; The state has been moving to the right in recent elections.&nbsp; There are other states that he won that he&#8217;s, I think, spent less time in.&nbsp; This is his sixth visit to Ohio.&nbsp; Why has he been spending so much time in Ohio?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; I mean, the President has said this himself many times.&nbsp; He’s the President for, you know, red states, blue states &#8212; for all Americans.&nbsp; And if there is something that he can speak to that’s going to help Americans and American families wherever he goes, he&#8217;s going to do that.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re doing here.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I mean, this pension announcement that we&#8217;re making via the American Rescue Plan is going to help &#8212; help families tremendously.&nbsp; You&#8217;ll hear directly from him, and he&#8217;ll &#8212; from the President in &#8212; you know, in a short few hours.&nbsp; He&#8217;ll lay out exactly what this &#8212; what this pension component of the American Rescue Plan is going to do.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But again, he will go &#8212; he will go wherever he needs to go to talk directly to the American people.&nbsp; And you guys have seen him.&nbsp; You guys have seen him deal with, you know, everyday Americans whenever he travels, and he connects, and &#8212; and I think it makes a difference for them to hear from &#8212; from their President directly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You mentioned the semiconductor legislation.&nbsp; I&#8217;m wondering if you can give us an update on the White House&#8217;s efforts to get that passed, given McConnell&#8217;s threat to pull Republican support for it last week.&nbsp; And are you prepared to roll that into a reconciliation package if he does follow through with that?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; So, on the &#8212; on USICA &#8212; this has many names &#8212; (laughs) &#8212; the COMPETES bill, CHIPS.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So the &#8212; but the Bipartisan Innovative Act, one thing that we do know is that it would lower the costs of countless products, including cars, and end our reliance on imports, which is really important.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, the question is &#8212; and as you&#8217;ve heard me &#8212; and you heard me say earlier &#8212; is: Does Senator Mitch McConnell really want to hold hostage a bipartisan package that would strengthen the American competitiveness versus China and yield hundreds of thousands of manufacturing jobs, in particular in Ohio, as we&#8217;re headed there today, and Indiana, Idaho, and other states around the country?</p>



<p>So, we know that this is going to make a difference for the American public.&nbsp; And so, this is something that&#8217;s important.&nbsp; We&#8217;re going to continue to work with Congress on this.</p>



<p>To your question about reconciliation: I&#8217;m not going to negotiate from here.&nbsp; That is another piece of legislation that we&#8217;ve been working very hard on that we know will also bring down inflation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So two pieces of legislation that we&#8217;re just going to continue to work hard on.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you preview a little bit of what&#8217;s in the President&#8217;s letter to Brittney Griner?&nbsp; And does the public support coming out right now help or hurt the ability of the U.S. government to get her out of Russia?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Let me just start with the first &#8212; the first part of your question, which is &#8212; and lay this down a little bit about what happened today.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So President Biden spoke with Brittney &#8212; Brittney’s wife, Cherelle, today to make sure she knows we are doing everything we can to get Brittney home as quickly as possible.&nbsp; President Biden shared the letter with her &#8212; with her that he is sending back to Brittney after receiving her deeply personal letter on July 4th, which all of you read.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The President has been clear about the need to see every American who is wrongfully detained or held hostage abroad released, including Brittney Griner.&nbsp; Months ago, he directed his national security team to pursue every avenue to bring her home safely to her family, friends, and loved ones.&nbsp; This has been top of mind for the President.&nbsp; He receives daily updates about the status of her &#8212; of her negotiations to secure Brittney&#8217;s release, and the U.S. government continues to work aggressively using every available means to bring her home, along with other wrongfully detained Americans like Paul Whelan.</p>



<p>And so, this is, again, a top priority for this President. And like I &#8212; like I just read, he gets daily updates on what is happening, how we&#8217;re going to secure her ho- &#8212; her efforts to come home and also Paul Whelan.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And there&#8217;s been some reports in Russian media about a trade maybe for Viktor Bout and Gri- &#8212; Brittney Griner.&nbsp; Is that something the U.S. government would consider?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; So, I&#8217;m not going to negotiate in public on this.&nbsp; This is something, clearly, that the State Department, with the Special Envoy, they are focused on getting home &#8212; not just Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan, but all U.S. nationals who are wrongfully detained abroad or held hostage abroad home.</p>



<p>This is a priority for this President.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not going to &#8212; I&#8217;m not going to negotiate in public on this.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The &#8212; how does the White House justify &#8212; you&#8217;ve talked about abortion quite a bit.&nbsp; How does the White House justify the anti-abortion judge in Kentucky &#8212; nominating &#8212; attempting to nominate him even after the leaked document &#8212; leaked ruling on the &#8212; from the Supreme Court?&nbsp; You guys had that May 4th.&nbsp; We reported on that.&nbsp; And then weeks later, you still were thinking about putting an anti-abortion judge to a lifetime appointment.&nbsp; How do you &#8212; how does the White House justify that?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; I mean, look, again &#8212; and I &#8212; I know I was asked this question yesterday.&nbsp;</p>



<p>(Air Force One experiences turbulence.)&nbsp; Hold on, everybody.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I&#8217;m just not &#8212; we just don’t comment on &#8212; on vacancies, whether executive branch or judicial, in situations where we have not made a nomination.&nbsp; We just have not made a nomination on this yet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I do want to add and reiterate that the President is proud that we&#8217;ve confirmed more federal judges than tha- &#8212; during &#8212; than during any of the pa- &#8212; the last three presidents &#8212; presidencies at the equivalent time in their administrations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That includes so many history-making firsts to help our judiciary &#8212; judiciary represent the diversity of America, including groundbreaking new Supreme Court justice.&nbsp; And that is something that we&#8217;re going to continue to do, and we won&#8217;t stop there.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And on Ukraine, Russia just captured its first full Ukrainian territory since Crimea in 2014.&nbsp; Is the United States and its allies going to push an enhanced response to the capture of Luhansk?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; An “enhanced response,” meaning &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whatever you guys &#8212; (laughs) &#8212; whatever you guys be &#8212; would be willing to do in seeing Russia take over this &#8212; the largest territory since Crimea.</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Yeah, so, you know, I was asked this question yesterday.&nbsp; And basically, you know, we have said for months that the fighting in the Donbas could be prolonged or protracted with gains and losses on both sides &#8212; you know, especially what we&#8217;re seeing today, as you just laid out, Eugene.</p>



<p>But that &#8212; that doesn&#8217;t mean that the Russians have been able to achieve their objectives here.&nbsp; And so &#8212; and the Ukrainians haven&#8217;t given up, right?&nbsp; They&#8217;re going to continue to fight for their democracy.&nbsp; They&#8217;re going to continue to fight for their freedom.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re going to continue to support them as we have been these past several months.&nbsp; We have given them the most amount of security assistance than any other country.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re going to continue to make sure that they&#8217;re able to &#8212; you know, to fight for that democracy and their &#8212; and their sovereignty.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And last question: You mentioned the support that the United States has given Ukraine and continues to give to Ukraine.</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Yes.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Ukrainian government says it&#8217;s going to cost upwards of $700 billion to kind of rebuild.&nbsp; Is the United States pledging to help lead that effort and give those &#8212; you know, a portion of that money, a lot of that &#8212; those billions of dollars to the government of Ukraine to help rebuild?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; So, I&#8217;ll say this: As the President said last week when he was in Europe, we will support Ukraine as it defends itself from Russia&#8217;s unprovoked attack for as long as it takes.&nbsp; The United States has been the world&#8217;s largest donor, as I just mentioned, of security, economic, and humanitarian assistance for Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And we will continue to coordinate with international partners on our support for Ukraine as they begin planning for how they will recover and rebuild after the war. &nbsp;And so, we&#8217;re going to just continue our support.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Thanks, everybody.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Karine.</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  All right.  We&#8217;ll see you on the ground. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Santa Monica Fire Station 2<br><em>Santa Monica, California</em></em></p>



<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:  So the President and I have been in close coordination, and we are being briefed on what&#8217;s happening right now in terms of the active shooter situation.  We are sending federal resources to local law enforcement and the folks on the ground to make sure that we can help them in terms of the capture of the shooter and any investigation that will follow.<br> <br>But right now, we do have an active shooter situation.  And so we are putting all of the resources possible into monitoring that in a way that we can bring this to a close in terms of also capture of the individual.<br> <br>I am going to travel to Chicago tomorrow morning to address the National Association of Educators, NEA.  And I was just sharing with some of our heroes, our local firefighters, a part of what I&#8217;m preparing &#8212; sadly, I was preparing it before, but it is resonant every day &#8212; is a whole section on what our teachers go through.  They go to school to learn how to teach our children, to inspire their ambition, to create the future generations of leaders.  And our teachers are also in training to deal with an active shooter.  Our teachers are having to learn how to put a tourniquet on a kid if they have been shot.<br> <br>And so, when we look at the issue of gun violence and when we look at the dangers that it presents to communities, it ranges and it is something that we should take very seriously.<br> <br>The President recently signed bipartisan legislation to address the issue of gun violence, but we clearly have much more to do.<br> <br>So, thank you all. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Highland Park, Illinois</em></p>



<p>7:18 P.M. CDT<br> <br>THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, to the community of Highland Park: I bring you condolences from President Joe Biden and from our country.  I&#8217;m so sorry for what you all have experienced and the pain, the suffering.  This should never have happened.  We talk about it being senseless; it is senseless.  It is absolutely senseless. <br> <br>I want for you that you hold each other tight as a community, that you know that you have a whole nation who cares deeply about you and stands with you.  This is a &#8212; an incredibly tight community.  I know that.  And this person will be brought to justice, but it&#8217;s not going to undo what happened.<br> <br>And we &#8212; we’re here for you, and we stand with you.  And of course, as we always say &#8212; because it is true &#8212; our prayers are with you. <br> <br>The President and I and our administration have put all of the resources and will continue to put all of the resources that the Mayor and the Chief and others need in terms of the federal assistance.  So the FBI and the ATF are here.<br> <br>There&#8217;s a lot of healing that&#8217;s going to have to happen that is both physical and emotional.  There is no question that this experience is something that is going to linger in terms of the trauma.  And so, I&#8217;d like to urge all the families and all the individuals to do seek the support that you so rightly deserve. <br> <br>And &#8212; and we&#8217;ll deal with what we need to deal with in terms of also, as we move forward, all agreeing that we&#8217;ve got to be smarter as a country in terms of who has access to what and, in particular, assault weapons.  And we got to take this stuff seriously, as seriously as you are &#8212; because you have been forced to have to take it seriously. <br> <br>The whole nation should understand and have a level of empathy to understand that this can happen anywhere, in any peace-loving community.  And we should stand together and speak out about why it&#8217;s got to stop.<br> <br>Thank you.<br> <br>                         END  7:21 P.M.
