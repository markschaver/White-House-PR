<p>Older Americans make invaluable contributions to our families, our communities, and our Nation every day.&nbsp; But for far too many, the sacred promise of aging with dignity in America is broken by unconscionable incidents of abuse, neglect, or exploitation. &nbsp;On World Elder Abuse Awareness Day, Americans of all ages join the international community to raise awareness and help bring an end to elder abuse.</p>



<p>Elder abuse can take many forms, including financial, emotional, physical, or sexual abuse, as well as exploitation and neglect.&nbsp; Every year, one in ten Americans aged 60 and older experiences abuse &#8212; and for every case of elder abuse that comes to the attention of authorities, it is estimated that 23&nbsp;cases are never brought to light.&nbsp; Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have also seen a chilling increase in hate crimes targeting Asian-Americans, many of whom have been elders.&nbsp; These attacks are shameful and deeply un-American.</p>



<p>Central to our Nation is the idea that we are all in this together, and that as Americans we owe one another a basic duty of care.&nbsp; The pandemic has both reinforced the importance of that duty and tested our capacity to meet it &#8212; the virus has exacerbated the quiet harm of social isolation among seniors around the world, a condition that makes abuse, neglect, and exploitation more likely.&nbsp; Having lost so many cherished seniors to this virus, we must recommit ourselves to fully including older Americans in our communities and systems of support.&nbsp; We&nbsp;must care for one another &#8212; and leave no one behind.</p>



<p>With over three-quarters of Americans 65 and over now fully vaccinated and more progress being made every day, the future for seniors is growing brighter and brighter.&nbsp; After a painful year, grandparents around the world are hugging their grandchildren again.&nbsp; Vaccinated seniors who were socially isolated are able to reengage with the broader community again.&nbsp; And as we begin to build back better, we are working to ensure that older Americans have greater opportunities to live with dignity, safety, independence, and social connections.</p>



<p>My Administration is committed to fulfilling that promise.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why the American Rescue Plan included more than $1.4 billion in additional funding for programs that promote community living and ensure the safety and protection of older adults.&nbsp; The law also enhances the Elder Justice Act and ensures that Adult Protective Services can be used to protect the safety and dignity of all seniors.&nbsp; Additionally, the plan included new Medicaid funding to expand access to critical home and community-based health care services, and over $275 million for elder justice programs that address abuse, neglect, and exploitation.&nbsp; The American Jobs Plan and American Families Plan will further that progress, building up the care infrastructure that our economy and so many families depend on &#8212; expanding day programs for seniors, programs that bring care workers to seniors&#8217; homes to cook meals, and programs to help seniors get around their home safely and live more independently.</p>



<p>As we expand opportunities for older Americans, my Administration will also not tolerate elder abuse or hate in any&nbsp;form.&nbsp; I have instructed agencies across the Federal Government to do their part to combat elder abuse and support survivors. &nbsp;We are working to renew and strengthen the Violence Against Women Act, which also dedicates Federal funds to develop a more comprehensive approach to addressing abuse and neglect in&nbsp;later life, including through the funding of victim service providers, law enforcement, and prosecutors working to prevent and respond to domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking experienced by older adults, whether caused by a spouse, family member, caregiver, or others.&nbsp; And this year, for the first time, the Federal Government has provided funding to Adult Protective Services programs in every State and Territory to support their critical, on-the-ground work investigating abuse and connecting victims to resources. &nbsp;</p>



<p>During World Elder Abuse Awareness Day, we also recognize the individuals who dedicate themselves to preventing elder abuse.&nbsp; All across our Nation, caregivers work to help older adults stay connected to their communities while preventing elder abuse and intervening if it occurs.&nbsp; These unsung heroes include family members, Adult Protective Services workers, social service providers, nonprofit victim services organizations, long-term care ombudspersons, law enforcement officers, judges and judicial personnel, legal professionals, health care professionals, and financial professionals.</p>



<p>On World Elder Abuse Awareness Day, we stand with all older Americans, and elderly people around the world, who are victims of elder abuse, neglect, and financial exploitation, and we recommit ourselves to protecting every senior&#8217;s right to live their golden years with dignity and respect.</p>



<p>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in&nbsp;me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do&nbsp;hereby proclaim June 15, 2021, as World Elder Abuse Awareness Day. &nbsp;I call upon all Americans to work for elder justice by building inclusive communities that welcome people of all ages and abilities; by learning the warning signs of elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation; and by challenging age-related biases.</p>



<p>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourteenth day of June, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-fifth.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-right"><br>                              JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">NATO Headquarters<br>Brussels, Belgium</p>



<p>12:28 P.M. CEST<br>&nbsp;<br>SECRETARY GENERAL STOLTENBERG:&nbsp; Mr. President, it is great to see you again and just a week after we met in the White House.&nbsp; And thank you so much for your strong personal commitment and powerful leadership on the transatlantic bond on what to do together &#8212; North America and Europe.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>We meet at a pivotal time for our Alliance.&nbsp; We will open a new chapter in our transatlantic relationship with the meeting today; address a wide range of issues, including Russia.&nbsp; And I think that the Allied leaders look forward to consulting with you ahead of the meeting with President Putin.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>We will address China, and we have seen the convergence of views among Allies.&nbsp; We all recognize that China&#8217;s heavy investments in military capabilities, continued coercive behavior, and their growing influence matters for our security.&nbsp; And we need to respond to that together as an Alliance.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>We will review the NATO 2030 agenda, an ambitious agenda for the future of NATO.&nbsp; And to do all this, we need to invest more.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s exactly what we&#8217;re doing with seven consecutive years of increased defense spending: 260 billion extra U.S. dollars across Europe and Canada.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So a strong NATO is good for Europe, but is also good for America.<br>&nbsp;<br>PRESIDENT BIDEN:&nbsp; It&#8217;s very good for America.&nbsp; It&#8217;s essential for America.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>SECRETARY GENERAL STOLTENBERG:&nbsp; And I know that &#8212; that no other major power has as many friends and allies as United States has in NATO.&nbsp; So I know that we can count on America and that America can count on Europe.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So, welcome, Mr. President.<br>&nbsp;<br>PRESIDENT BIDEN:&nbsp; Well, thank you.&nbsp; And thank you for your incredible leadership over the years.&nbsp; I really mean this: You have been incredible.&nbsp; I &#8212; quite frankly, we have competent people coming, but I wish you weren&#8217;t leaving, because &#8212; and, no, I really mean it &#8212; you have been absolutely incredible and you&#8217;ve been strong.&nbsp; You&#8217;ve been &#8212; you&#8217;ve been able to pull people together.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And I think that there is a growing recognition over the last couple of years that we have new challenges.&nbsp; And we have Russia that is not acting in a way that is consistent with what we had hoped, and &#8212; as well as China.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And I must say that we had as (inaudible) a number of my colleagues and our colleagues who are in the G7 have stepped up as well, in terms of the need for there to be greater coordination.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And we&#8217;ve had &#8212; but I want to make it clear: NATO is critically important for U.S. interests in and of itself.&nbsp; If there weren&#8217;t one, we&#8217;d have to invent one.&nbsp; It is &#8212; it allows America to &#8212; to conduct its business around the world in a way that never would have occurred were it not for NATO, number one.<br>&nbsp;<br>Number two, you know, I believe &#8212; and I&#8217;ve said this my whole career and the four years I was out, when I decided to run for President again &#8212; that NATO is &#8212; Article 5, we take as a sacred obligation.&nbsp; And I constantly remind Americans that when America was attacked for the first time on its shores since what happened back in the beginning of World War Two, NATO stepped up.&nbsp; NATO stepped up and they honored Article 5.&nbsp; And I just want all of Europe to know that the United States is there.&nbsp; The United States is there.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And we &#8212; and we are pleased, back in Wales, the decision was made to increase spending.&nbsp; You&#8217;re right, it&#8217;s moving up.&nbsp; I guess there&#8217;s more than 10 countries that have met the goal, and others are on the way.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And so it&#8217;s &#8212; it&#8217;s important, but it&#8217;s &#8212; I just want to thank you for your leadership.&nbsp; A lot of this wouldn&#8217;t happen without you.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>SECRETARY GENERAL STOLTENBERG:&nbsp; Thank you so much.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>PRESIDENT BIDEN:&nbsp; I mean it.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>SECRETARY GENERAL STOLTENBERG:&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>12:32 P.M.

<p class="has-text-align-center">Aboard Air Force One<br>En Route Brussels, Belgium</p>



<p>8:05 P.M. BST<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Thank you for joining us on Air Force One, on our trip to Brussels.&nbsp; And we have joining us our National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, who will give us a preview of NATO, take some questions, and I&#8217;m also happy to take some once he&#8217;s done.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; Thanks, everybody.&nbsp; President Biden is heading to Brussels for his first NATO Summit with the overriding objective of sending a clear message to Allies and adversaries alike that Article 5 is a sacred guarantee; that the United States regards NATO as the foundation for our security &#8212; not just in the Euro Atlantic, but worldwide &#8212; and that we will be there for our Allies.&nbsp; We will have their backs just as they&#8217;ve had our backs.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>He&#8217;ll cover a range of issues during the session with the leaders, including, of course, the immediate issue of the drawdown in Afghanistan, where we&#8217;re proceeding on an in-together, out-together basis, and coordinating very closely with our Allies as we draw down our remaining forces.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>He will also consult on ensuring security for an embassy presence that can continue to provide support to the Afghan National Security Forces and to the Afghan government, as well as humanitarian and civilian assistance to the Afghan people, especially to its women and girls.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>He will discuss cyber as an increasingly important dimension of NATO&#8217;s work.&nbsp; NATO will finalize a national cyber &#8212; or, I&#8217;m sorry, not a &#8220;national&#8221; &#8212; will finalize a cyber defense strategy for the first time in seven years, which will upgrade the defense, political, and intelligence dimensions of cyber across the Alliance.&nbsp; That will not be a public document, but he will have the chance to consult with Allies on it.&nbsp; And in the communiqué that will be released, there will be a strong commitment to NATO&#8217;s emphasis on cyber deterrence and collective defense, as well as Article 5 applying on a case-by-case basis to cyberattacks of significance.<br>&nbsp;<br>Of course, he will discuss the emerging challenges posed by China, not just in the Indo-Pacific but elsewhere, in terms of technology and cybersecurity and information warfare and in other regards, as well.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And China will feature in the communiqué really in a more robust way than we&#8217;ve ever seen before.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you repeat that?&nbsp; Sorry.&nbsp; Just didn’t hear the last line.<br>&nbsp;<br>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; China will feature in the communiqué in a more robust way than we&#8217;ve ever seen before.<br>&nbsp;<br>What we will see coming out of this is a commitment by leaders to a new Strategic Concept process that will result in the release of a new Strategic Concept at a NATO Summit next year, in 2022.&nbsp; The last Strategic Concept was done in 2010, and, among other things, referred to Russia as a &#8220;constructive partner,&#8221; and really didn&#8217;t talk about China at all.&nbsp; So it&#8217;s time for an update to that Strategic Concept for NATO.&nbsp; And he will consult with Allies and partners at the summit about this.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>There will also be a Climate Action Plan.&nbsp; The Secretary General, with the support of the President and others, wants NATO to be the premier international security organization working on the intersection between climate and security.&nbsp; And, obviously, the climate dimension of everything &#8212; all of our militaries do and all of our security systems do &#8212; is growing and intensifying.&nbsp; And NATO will be front and center in all of that.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And then, of course, there&#8217;s the consultation on Russia.&nbsp; He&#8217;ll have the opportunity to speak to all of the Allies about what he intends to talk to Putin about.&nbsp; He&#8217;ll do that behind closed doors.&nbsp; So, they get both to hear from him about his intentions with respect to the summit, and he gets to hear from them as well, so that he will go into Geneva with the full support and solidarity of all of our NATO Allies.<br>&nbsp;<br>He will meet on the sidelines of the summit with the Baltic presidents, who are a powerful example of democratic governance on NATO&#8217;s eastern flank.&nbsp; And he will speak with them about a range of issues, including the challenge and threat posed by Russia about issues related to cyber and emerging technology, on which they are leaders; about China and the growing challenges it poses as well; and, of course, about the recent air piracy in Belarus.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And he will also meet with President Erdoğan of Turkey, where they will cover the range of issues in our bilateral relationship, as well as a number of important regional issues, from Syria, to Libya, to the eastern Mediterranean.&nbsp; They will also have the chance to consult on the big powers &#8212; China and Russia &#8212; as well.<br>&nbsp;<br>So I think I will &#8212; I will leave it at that.&nbsp; I guess I would just close by saying that if you think about the G7 as really centering on the most significant nonmilitary challenges of our time, and President Biden coming out of the G7 Summit with the democracies united behind an affirmative agenda to deal with those challenges, he heads into NATO really to focus on the security and military dimension of this.&nbsp; But that security and military dimension itself is changing, and cyber and emerging technology will play an important role in that.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And so by the time we&#8217;re done tomorrow, in Brussels, when you combine the G7 and NATO, it&#8217;s just a really powerful platform upon which America can conduct its foreign policy in the years ahead.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So let me stop there.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Talk about China a little bit.&nbsp; What role should NATO have in countering China?<br>&nbsp;<br>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; I think there are three things that I particularly focus on.&nbsp; One is that NATO has a role in information sharing about the nature of the security challenges that China poses.&nbsp; It imposes challenges to individual Allies in both common and distinct ways.&nbsp; And so, a broader, common picture of that challenge will be very important.<br>&nbsp;<br>Second, of course, is that, increasingly, in the area particularly of emerging technology, China is growing much more sophisticated in its warfighting capabilities and methods, including in the nuclear sphere.&nbsp; And so, NATO has to play a role in developing interoperable capabilities to be able to deal with a challenge from China that is going beyond the region and extending much more broadly.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And then, thirdly, NATO is, first and foremost, the center for security and military coordination and collective defense, but it is also a forum for democratic values.&nbsp; It is an alliance of democracies.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And so, NATO speaking out powerfully about the common purpose and common strength of democracies is an important part of a collective effort to be able to meet the China challenge over the decades ahead.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jake, on the &#8212; at the G7, did he hear anything about the origins of COVID?&nbsp; Any intel shared with him that he didn&#8217;t know before?&nbsp; Did any of the Allies have anything new to share with him about that?<br>&nbsp;<br>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; So, they all pledged to &#8212; not only does the communiqué talk about a WHO-led phase two investigation that should take place in China and get to the bottom of things in China, including the original data that was withheld in the first study, but all of the countries also pledged that they would have their national systems try to share analysis and information in the weeks and months ahead, both with that international investigation and with each other.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So I think there was a common sense that we&#8217;ve all got to dig deeper ourselves, as well as supporting this international effort, and then pool our knowledge so we can get the best, most clear, most evidence-based picture of what actually happened with the outbreak of COVID.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So there wasn&#8217;t consensus on whether it was lab-based or hu- &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; No.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So no one &#8212; no one really knows?<br>&nbsp;<br>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; No.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jake, on cyber, two things.&nbsp; Can you talk a little more about what invoking Article 5 might look like, in terms of a cyber incident?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And then also, the President was asked today about this idea that was floated from the Kremlin about trading cyber hackers.&nbsp; Are there hackers in America who have been doing &#8212; committing cyber crimes in Russia that we should be &#8212; walk us through that really means.<br>&nbsp;<br>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; So, what the President was responding to in the affirmative was not the specific proposal of the exchange of cyber criminals.&nbsp; He was not saying, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to exchange cyber criminals.&#8221;&nbsp; What he was saying was that if Vladimir Putin wants to come and say, &#8220;I&#8217;m prepared to make sure that cyber criminals are held accountable,&#8221; Joe Biden is perfectly willing to show up and say cyber criminals will be held accountable in America, because they already are.&nbsp; That is something that we do &#8212; is when we know that someone is committing a cyber crime, whether against a domestic target or a foreign target, we take action against them.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And so to the extent what Vladimir Putin wants is a common commitment that no country &#8212; neither Russia nor the United States nor anyone else &#8212; will hyber [sic] &#8212; will harbor cyber criminals, whether ransomware attackers or otherwise, Joe Biden is all in for that.<br>&nbsp;<br>He&#8217;s not saying he&#8217;s going to be exchanging cyber criminals with Russia.&nbsp; There&#8217;s no cyber criminals who have committed crimes in Russia that he&#8217;s looking at and thinking, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to exchange them.”&nbsp; I think that was overread or misread in the press coming out of &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That’s not what he said, right?&nbsp; I mean, he did &#8212; he did talk about specifically exchanging &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; If you go back and look at the transcript, I think you will actually see he didn&#8217;t talk about exchanging cyber criminals.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What did he mean then?<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like, “prisoner swap” &#8212; he didn&#8217;t say that.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; What’s that?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He didn&#8217;t say &#8220;prisoner swap.&#8221;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; He didn&#8217;t say &#8220;prisoner swap.&#8221;&nbsp; What he was talking about was accountability and the idea that responsible countries should hold &#8212; should be held accountable to not harboring cyber criminals, and to bringing cyber criminals to justice.&nbsp; He&#8217;s prepared to do that in the United States.&nbsp; He&#8217;d like to see Vladimir Putin do that.<br>&nbsp;<br>This is not about exchanges or swaps, or anything like that.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Northern Ireland &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; Oh, sorry, just on cyber, really fast, and Article 5: This would be on a case-by-case basis.&nbsp; And the notion is that if someone gets hit by a massive cyberattack, and they need technical or intelligence support from another Ally to be able to deal with it, they could invoke Article 5 to be able to get that.&nbsp; So &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And that&#8217;s being proposed tomorrow?<br>&nbsp;<br>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; That&#8217;s the concept.&nbsp; That&#8217;s &#8212; that will be in the communiqué coming out of (inaudible).&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jake, on China, when you&#8217;re bringing this up with NATO, in the past it&#8217;s mostly been focused about Russia, or in more recent past, Macron has talked about concerns about the United&#8217;s focus is turning to the east, and not locally.&nbsp; How do you bring the Europeans along more?&nbsp; I mean, even in &#8212; even in the G7, in the communiqué, with forced labor, in that paragraph &#8212; correct me if I&#8217;m wrong &#8212; it does not have China in it, but it is mentioned in the communiqué.&nbsp; So how do you bring them along in these next steps, in the NATO &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; Well, I think forced labor is a great example of how we are all converging around a common strategy, and that strategy is ultimately about action.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And so the communiqué doesn’t just say “forced labor” generically, it says “forced labor” with specific reference to solar, garments, and agriculture.&nbsp; And so where is the world solar made?&nbsp; What are the main products coming out of Xinjiang?&nbsp; You have cotton, you have garments, et cetera.<br>&nbsp;<br>So the basic notion in the communiqué was: Call out Xinjiang in terms of its human rights abuses and then establish a neutral principle that all democracies can stand behind.&nbsp; We are going to take concrete action and countermeasures against forced labor in these areas.&nbsp; And when you actually apply that in practice, that will have an impact on Xinjiang.<br>&nbsp;<br>So, from Joe Biden’s perspective, the idea here is not to score rhetorical points.&nbsp; The idea is to get agreement around a common set of principles and a common strategy.&nbsp; And if you go through the communiqué and look at the areas where they got that convergence, they are all the central pillars of how we believe we should be dealing with the challenge of China: supply chain resilience, technology standards, an infrastructure alternative, as well as robust, specific, explicit language on human rights and on China’s non-market practices.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>So that’s how we think about G7 and why we actually think this communiqué is a significant move forward from where the G7 has ever been before, and reflects a growing convergence that wasn&#8217;t there a few years ago.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>But it&#8217;s also how we&#8217;re going to approach NATO.&nbsp; You&#8217;re not going to see, like, paragraphs and paragraphs about China in the communiqué.&nbsp; And the language is not going to be inflammatory.&nbsp; It&#8217;s going to be clear, straightforward, and direct.&nbsp; And also, we&#8217;re not going to try to over-crank the extent to which tomorrow is about China by any stretch.&nbsp; Tomorrow is about collective security and defense, and climate will be on the agenda; cyber will be on the agenda; Russia will be on the agenda; terrorism will be on the agenda; and this Afghanistan drawdown will be a significant issue.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>But, yes, China will be there in a way it hasn&#8217;t before.&nbsp; And I think President Biden&#8217;s view is: Explain how we see things in a transparent and clear way.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t try to push towards confrontation or conflict, but be prepared to try to rally allies and partners towards what is going to be tough competition in the years ahead.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s true in the security domain as it is in the economic and technological domains.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jake, on Northern Ireland &#8212; sorry &#8212; did the President say anything in his conversations with Prime Minister Johnson about whether a U.S.-UK trade deal would be at risk if he doesn&#8217;t protect the Good Friday Agreement?&nbsp; Did he ask Boris Johnson not to renege on Brexit &#8212; on the Brexit pact?&nbsp; Or can you share a little bit about what the President told Boris Johnson about &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; All I&#8217;m going to say: They did discuss this issue.&nbsp; They had a candid discussion of it in private.&nbsp; The President naturally, and with, you know, deep sincerity, encouraged the Prime Minister to protect the Good Friday Agreement and the progress made under it.&nbsp; The specifics beyond that, I&#8217;m not going to get into.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Afghanistan, does he intend to touch on the Kabul issue and particularly the security at the airport &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; Yes.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; maybe with Mr. Erdoğan?<br>&nbsp;<br>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; Yes.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Inaudible) come up with a solutions (inaudible)?<br>&nbsp;<br>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; He will discuss embassy presence with a broad range of allied embassies, and he will discuss security arrangements, specifically including with President Erdoğan.&nbsp; And I&#8217;m not going to go into further details because those discussions are, you know, best to take place privately and with some degree of sensitivity.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jake, the event &#8212; I&#8217;m sorry, you didn’t ask a question.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you take us inside the conversations at the G7 as much as you can, about China?&nbsp; I mean, how much convincing did it take to get everybody on board on the China language?&nbsp; And what was the, sort of, inside-the-room pitch that the President made to other world leaders on this?&nbsp; And did it look any different than what he said in public?<br>&nbsp;<br>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; I guess the way that I would look at this is: This is not &#8212; it&#8217;s been framed up a bit as “Joe Biden walked in to convince everybody else on China.”&nbsp; And I think that&#8217;s not quite accurate.&nbsp; Each country has its set of concerns that it emphasizes vis-à-vis China.&nbsp; And what the President sought to do was bring all of that together into a common picture of what we need to do collectively as democracies to respond.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So, there isn&#8217;t a &#8212; you know, whether it&#8217;s Germany or it’s Italy, or it’s France, or it’s the UK or Canada, to &#8212; on different issues, they have different levels of conviction about the depth of the challenge.&nbsp; But when you add it all up, actually, the whole became greater than the sum of its parts, because there is a broad view that China represents a significant challenge to the world&#8217;s democracies on a number of different dimensions, and that we need a common agenda that is mostly affirmative but also has elements where we are going to stand up and counter and compete.&nbsp; And words like “counter” and “compete” were words coming out of the mouths of every leader in the room, not just Joe Biden.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So it wasn&#8217;t like he had to sit there and make a legal case to try to bring people around.&nbsp; I think the role that he felt he could play was to take the different perspectives and try to stitch them together into a coherent and common whole.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And, honestly, from the transition &#8212; when there was fundamental questions about whether we were going to be deeply at odds with our European partners over China, and when the European Union signed on to the investment agreement with China &#8212; to today, when we released this communiqué and, at the end of this, you have seen, as I said before, a significant convergence on these issues, including to the point where that investment agreement is actually currently suspended.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So, you know, we believe where we&#8217;re sitting today is not the end of the story, but it is a good platform upon which to build.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I ask you about the next chapter of that story?&nbsp; I mean, it seemed to go well at the G7.&nbsp; You know, everybody was friendly.&nbsp; You know, you didn&#8217;t have the tensions that you had in the &#8212; a few years ago.&nbsp; What&#8217;s the next step?&nbsp; I mean, how do you take that and go next to &#8212; whether it&#8217;s policy or concrete, how do you take what symbolism (inaudible) those relationships and move forward?<br>&nbsp;<br>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; I mean, ultimately, actions speak louder than words, and the proof will be in the pudding for all of us, including the United States.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So I would say the metrics over the course of the next year are, number one: Can we actually get Build Back Better World off the ground with meaningful financing behind it and a real impetus?&nbsp; I believe the answer to that question is, yes, there&#8217;s real energy and enthusiasm behind it, but we got to do it.&nbsp; Can we turn the commitments on forced labor and ending overseas financing of coal into genuine outcomes by the end of this year or into early next year on forced labor?&nbsp; I believe the answer is yes, but we&#8217;re going to have to prove it.&nbsp; We&#8217;re going to have to prove it on actually delivering these vaccines and on the broader, comprehensive COVID agenda.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So what we have is a good program of work.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a program of work that reflects a common strategy.&nbsp; That is an affirmative strategy, but also has an element of ensuring we compete with a position of &#8212; from a position of strength with China.&nbsp; And now we&#8217;ve got to actually execute on it.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So one year from today, at the next G7 &#8212; I&#8217;m not sure where that is.&nbsp; Do you know where the next G7 is?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know where the next one is.&nbsp; We’ll have to get back to you on that.<br>&nbsp;<br>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; Yeah, we’ll have to get back to you.<br>&nbsp;<br>We actually now have a metric against which to judge ourselves.&nbsp; And I&#8217;m not going to hide from that.&nbsp; If we haven&#8217;t achieved it, I&#8217;ll move the goalposts next year.&nbsp; Okay?&nbsp; But for now &#8212; (laughs) &#8212; no, that’s a joke.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What does “meaningful financing” look like for B3W?&nbsp; I mean, you said hundreds of millions of dollars, but there&#8217;s &#8212; sorry, hundreds of billions of dollars, but there’s a $41 trillion infrastructure gap.&nbsp; So that&#8217;s a pretty big gap in your own &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; I mean &#8212; but that&#8217;s like saying BRI is a drop in the bucket because it&#8217;s between 500 and a trillion.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>It&#8217;s true that there is infinite demand.&nbsp; But the fact is that, you know, we need to look at what are immediately bankable projects; where is there absorptive capacity; how do we get this money out the door in a way that actually is going to produce the physical or digital or health infrastructure.<br>&nbsp;<br>So I think, in the first few years, the idea that we&#8217;d be mobilizing this amount of money and proving out concept and building momentum will take us a long way.&nbsp; And that $40 trillion goes out &#8212; first goes out to 2035.&nbsp; And, second, we&#8217;re not going to stand here and pretend like we&#8217;re going to fill the entire $40 trillion gap.&nbsp; We&#8217;re going to try and make a real dent in it between now and 15 years from now.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jake, can you clarify what the President said when he talked about there being a dilemma for Russia as it relates to Libya?&nbsp; Presumably he was referring to Syria.&nbsp; Is there more clarity?<br>&nbsp;<br>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; Syria.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He meant Syria, then?<br>&nbsp;<br>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; Yeah, he did.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, there was reporting today about how when these G7 leaders work together, that there were concerns that China may be spying on these conversations.&nbsp; Can you talk about, like, what that reveals about the concerns that still exist (inaudible)?<br>&nbsp;<br>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; I think that was a garble, to be honest with you.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was a what?<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A garble?<br>&nbsp;<br>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; Who said &#8212; who said that?&nbsp; That was the thing about &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The cell signal around the room where the leaders was meeting was blocked at times.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was blocked to protect those conversations.<br>&nbsp;<br>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; Well, I think &#8212; honestly think this was a garble.&nbsp; I think it was &#8212; like many beautiful coastal spots in America, Cornwall has spotty cell service, which I experienced&nbsp;considerably.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t &#8212; like, I do not believe or know &#8212; I wasn&#8217;t in that session, so I can&#8217;t say for sure.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was in multiple sessions that cell service was blocked.<br>&nbsp;<br>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; Oh, no, I was in &#8212; I was in multiple sessions, and I was on my phone.&nbsp; So &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We got jammed.&nbsp; We felt like we were being jammed at one point.&nbsp; Yeah.<br>&nbsp;<br>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t think this is correct.&nbsp; I will check on it for you guys to be sure.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not trying to hide the ball here.&nbsp; But I was in four of the six sessions and on my phone on all of them.&nbsp; So, I don&#8217;t know about cell service being blocked.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did you see the statement from the Chinese &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; You look skeptical, but I&#8217;m telling you, I was sitting there &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because even one of your briefers told us on &#8212; one of the senior administration officials said that the cell &#8212; that Internet was blocked during the meetings.&nbsp; But you’re saying &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don’t think that was actually the exact phrasing.&nbsp; I mean, he didn’t have access at times to Internet, and is having a hard time getting access to his computer and his notes.<br>&nbsp;<br>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; I genuinely don’t think Internet was blocked, but I don&#8217;t know.&nbsp; If it was, it was only for the sessions I wasn&#8217;t in, because I will show you the receipts of all the emails I sent.&nbsp; In fact &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The point was: We’re asking what it reflects on the Chinese relationship.<br>&nbsp;<br>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; When I was &#8212; I would frequently have to look up and make sure the President wasn&#8217;t looking back at me while I was on my phone during.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Anyway, that&#8217;s off the record.&nbsp; Just kidding.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know (inaudible).<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did you see the statement from the Chinese Embassy in London saying that China would not pay attention to a group of small countries?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; Which group of small countries is that?<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Talking about the G7?<br>&nbsp;<br>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; (Laughs.)&nbsp; That is sad.&nbsp; So, if their claim is that all of the other world&#8217;s largest economies count as small countries, then they have a massive problem of perspective.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this &#8212; is (inaudible) at G7, NATO &#8212; can you connect it to the priority of being foreign policy for the middle class?<br>&nbsp;<br>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; NATO?<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, both &#8212; the G7 and NATO.<br>&nbsp;<br>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; I mean, G7 &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Inaudible) very strong priority (inaudible).<br>&nbsp;<br>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; Yeah &#8212; so, G7, at its core, is about sustainable, equitable economic recovery that will deliver for the American middle class.&nbsp; The global minimum tax is &#8212; was one of our top priorities in terms of delivering for the American people.&nbsp; The dollars that will put in our fist to be able to invest back in workers and communities are substantial.&nbsp; So that&#8217;s one big outcome in that regard.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Even something like Build Back Better World actually interacts in a really interesting way with the American Jobs Plan, because as we invest in and develop clean energy technologies or water infrastructure that we&#8217;re building out in the United States, investing this money overseas through Build Back Better World will actually give export opportunities for American-made products and technologies.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re very mindful of that and would be proud of that as a &#8212; as a feature of Build Back Better World.<br>&nbsp;<br>And then, all of the work on supply chain resilience so that we&#8217;re never again dependent on another country in a crisis and so that we have sufficient manufacturing capacity at home for critical materials, sensitive materials &#8212; that&#8217;s going to deliver jobs and economic growth for the middle class.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So those are just three &#8212; three examples.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You mentioned &#8212; you mentioned briefly Erdoğan, but could you give us a little more sense as to what the agenda is tomorrow in that &#8212; in that bilateral?<br>&nbsp;<br>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; Yeah, so they will talk about Afghanistan and, in particular, how we ensure that our embassies can stay in a safe and secure way in Afghanistan to be able to do all the things that we want to do in providing for the Afghan government and security forces and people.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>They will talk about Syria and humanitarian access, among other issues in the counterterrorism space.&nbsp; They will talk about the eastern Mediterranean.&nbsp; They will talk about Libya.&nbsp; They will talk about political and economic issues that are more challenging.&nbsp; And then they will &#8212; that have been challenges in our relationship, including human rights-related issues.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And they will talk about the &#8212; as I said in my opening laydown, Russia and China.&nbsp; You know, Russia, obviously, is both at odds with Turkey in some places and working with Turkey in others.&nbsp; So it&#8217;ll be an interesting chance for him to compare notes with Erdoğan before seeing Putin.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is he prepared to talk about their meetings (inaudible)?<br>&nbsp;<br>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The S-400s &#8212; will he bring that up as well?<br>&nbsp;<br>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; Yes, he will.&nbsp; The S-4- &#8212; yeah, the air defense system in &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The (inaudible).<br>&nbsp;<br>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; &#8212; in Turkey.&nbsp; Yes.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And can you give us any idea of what he might say on the S-400s?<br>&nbsp;<br>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; I&#8217;m following the Biden Doctrine, and I will, you know, let him have that conversation with Erdoğan.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the Afghanistan interpreters who helped the U.S. military, was there any discussion amongst the Allies in any of the G7 meetings or pull-asides about what to do about &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; He spoke with several leaders &#8212; I guess not several.&nbsp; He spoke with a few leaders &#8212; particularly like the Germans, who have troops as part of the drawdown now in Afghanistan &#8212; about interpreters, translators, others who have supported not just us, but NATO and their countries about what we&#8217;re going to collectively do to make sure that we meet the obligation we have to get them out.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So was there any conclusion on that?&nbsp; Is there more of a plan now than you had before going into the G7 on what to do on (inaudible)?<br>&nbsp;<br>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; For them, it was an opportunity at the leader level to communicate to each other and then to be able to communicate down to their systems, send a pulse through their systems.&nbsp; This is a massive priority for our President, as well as for the leaders of these other countries.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, on ransoms, was there debate amongst the Allies at the G7 meetings about whether or not they should say something about whether to pay ransoms?&nbsp; Was that a topic of discussion?<br>&nbsp;<br>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; Not really.&nbsp; Too much to talk about.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Russia, today in the news conference, (inaudible) say that there is no guarantee that he can change Vladimir Putin; Vladimir Putin is Vladimir Putin.&nbsp; Do you come into this with &#8212; like, can you &#8212; can you sort of assess the level of optimism or confidence that anything can be done to change the behavior of this man, given the experience that the President acknowledged in terms of sanctions not really having a real impact on his behavior?<br>&nbsp;<br>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; I think there are two fundamental elements to how we think about dealing with Russia.&nbsp; One is: Are there areas where, in our common interest, we can work together to produce outcomes that are &#8212; that work for the United States and for the American people?<br>&nbsp;<br>And the other is: How do we send a clear message about those harmful activities that we will not tolerate and to which we will respond?<br>&nbsp;<br>On the second: Of course, we can&#8217;t make guarantees about what Russia will do, but we can make pledges about what America will do, which is we will respond if those harmful activities continue.<br>&nbsp;<br>On the first: We will see where we get.&nbsp; There&#8217;s the question of strategic stability.&nbsp; There&#8217;s the question of Syria and humanitarian access.&nbsp; There are issues related to the Arctic.&nbsp; There are other places where it would be in our interest to find a basis to work with Russia.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If a country attacks us by cyber, does the United States respond by cyber?&nbsp; Can the United States respond by cyber?<br>&nbsp;<br>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; The way that I&#8217;ve consistently characterized our response when it &#8212; when it came to SolarWinds and to other cyberattacks of that scope and scale is that we are prepared to take responsive actions that are seen and unseen, and I&#8217;ll leave it at that.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you say anything more about U.S-UK travel and whether &#8212; I know that there was a working group on this, but, at the leader level, was there any discussion about opening up?&nbsp; And how soon might we see that?<br>&nbsp;<br>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; They did discuss it.&nbsp; You know, the President expressed his deep understanding that the UK would love to have its citizens travel to the U.S. as soon as possible.&nbsp; But he also communicated that this ultimately is a decision for the public health experts to make according to their guidance, and that&#8217;s what the point of getting our experts together is: so that the UK experts can share all the information necessary to help hasten that decision.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You said the U.S. can take actions that are “seen and unseen.”&nbsp; So in reaction to what the FBI has now said was crimes committed by cyber criminals within Russia, has the U.S. taken any unseen actions in that window of time since its response?<br>&nbsp;<br>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; I&#8217;m not going to say anything further on that except to point out that we do see a difference between SolarWinds, on the one hand, and ransomware attacks on the other hand.&nbsp; Ultimately, we don&#8217;t judge Russia &#8212; the Russian government &#8212; was responsible for the ransomware attacks, but we have said it is &#8212; it is Russia&#8217;s sovereign obligation to deal with it, and we have communicated that to them.&nbsp; And that is a continuing dialogue between our countries.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the President said that &#8212; what President Putin said to NBC News, he said that he had no knowledge of these ransomware attacks.&nbsp; Do you take President Putin at his word that he would have no knowledge of this in any form?<br>&nbsp;<br>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; I can&#8217;t &#8212; I can&#8217;t speak to that one way or the other.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was a date set for Angela Merkel&#8217;s visit to the White House then?<br>&nbsp;<br>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; Yes.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do we know what that is?<br>&nbsp;<br>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; July 15.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I think we announced it.<br>&nbsp;<br>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; Yeah.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;All right. &nbsp;It&#8217;s Jerome&#8217;s last trip, so &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right here.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I know he’s not the President, but he&#8217;s the National Security Advisor, so we have to celebrate you.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seven years of White House, so, yeah.<br>&nbsp;<br>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; Amazing.&nbsp; All right.&nbsp; Well, hopefully, you know, we&#8217;ll end it with &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We&#8217;re thinking of maybe having drinks on Monday.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes.<br>&nbsp;<br>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; Let&#8217;s do it.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Monday?&nbsp; That&#8217;s tomorrow.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; It&#8217;s probably a good time (inaudible).<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Send us the details.<br>&nbsp;<br>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; Right, because the very exciting U.S.-EU Summit is the next day &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; That&#8217;s right.<br>&nbsp;<br>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; &#8212; which I know all of you guys (inaudible).<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All the more reason to &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That’s why we’re doing it Monday.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Okay.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jake.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Anything I can do for you?<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, anything on if he&#8217;s inviting the Queen to the White House?&nbsp; It seemed like he invited the Queen.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did he invite the Queen?&nbsp; Or was he just sort of speaking colloquially?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I will have to talk with him about that.&nbsp; That wasn&#8217;t a prior planned offer.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I understand.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>You guys have now had a little bit of time to review the infrastructure package that the Republican &#8212; that the bipartisan group of 10 senators proposed at this point: $1.2 trillion over eight years, I think.&nbsp; Do you have any comments on it right now?&nbsp; Is it sufficient?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>And what do you say to Democrats who say that you&#8217;re effectively wasting your time by continuing to do this without just pursuing your own policy goals?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, first, I&#8217;ve talked to the President about this.&nbsp; He&#8217;s staying in close touch with his senior team back at the White House.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Before he left, he asked the Jobs Cabinet and members of his senior White House team, including, of course, Ron Klain, but also Steve Ricchetti, Louisa Terrell, and others to stay closely engaged with members as they continue to discuss multiple paths forward and multiple options for getting his ideas passed into law.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>We&#8217;re still taking a look, still having conversations with these &#8212; the members of this bipartisan group.&nbsp; I would &#8212; on the second part of your question, though, I would say that the way we see it is that we&#8217;re looking to see where we can find common ground on infrastructure and on areas where there&#8217;s overlap and agreement.&nbsp; We are still moving forward with a budget process, which is another path and a simultaneous path to get a range of these ideas passed into law, as well as corporate tax reform.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So, in response to folks who are saying we&#8217;re delaying, we&#8217;re not.&nbsp; We&#8217;re moving on both tracks at the same time.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And has he talked to Manchin or Romney specifically about their infrastructure proposal?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; He has asked his team to stay in close touch with members &#8212; a range of members &#8212; and he has been updated by them at least once a day, sometimes twice, since he started the trip.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But he hasn&#8217;t spoken to them directly yet, that you know of?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; He has not had those &#8212; he has not had those engagements on the trip.&nbsp; He&#8217;s been &#8212; he&#8217;s been busy.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you pull back the curtain a little bit in advance of the Putin summit about how he is being prepared, prepped on this?&nbsp; Obviously, the National Security Advisor has been with him throughout, but, like, how does one prepare for these visits?&nbsp; Obviously, they have interactions in the past.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the First Lady said he was &#8220;overprepared.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Said he was &#8220;overprepared.&#8221;&nbsp; Right.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; (Laughs.)&nbsp; Well, what I think she meant by that &#8212; I also know she said &#8212; which I agree with, from having many conversations with him &#8212; is that foreign policy, national security, you know, engaging on the world stage is an area that has been a central focus of his 50 years in public life and public office.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And so, he, of course, has engaged with President Putin before, as you well know.&nbsp; And, you know, he certainly knows what to expect.&nbsp; His view is that this is not a meeting about trust, it&#8217;s not a meeting about friendship &#8212; it&#8217;s a meeting about figuring out where we can find common ground, and also being straightforward and candid about areas where we have concern.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So, really, he has actually been spending some time preparing for each of these rounds of meetings.&nbsp; You know, as we were just talking about the G summit &#8212; the G &#8212; the G7 with Jake, there was a lot that happened during that summit, from COVID, from the cyber ransomware, China.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>A lot of the discussions over the &#8212; the majority of the discussions over the last two days, on a staff level, were about the summit and those meetings.&nbsp; And the majority of meetings he&#8217;ll have tonight and tomorrow morning are about NATO.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So this is a very packed trip.&nbsp; And certainly he&#8217;ll spend time preparing with his team, talking about where there are opportunities to engage on the path forward with President Putin.&nbsp; But I would also just reiterate he&#8217;s been preparing for this moment for 50 years.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are you concerned about vaccines not reaching 70 percent by July 4th?&nbsp; Does that say anything about divisions in America?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would say: Look, at the end of the day, it is &#8212; at this point, what the government can do is we can provide the resources, we can incentivize, we can provide the funding, the vaccine supply, and work with states and localities to do everything we can &#8212; and in the private sector &#8212; to incentivize people to get shots in their arms.&nbsp; It is ultimately up to individuals to do that.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>What you&#8217;ve seen is that a number of states have met and surpassed that goal, right?&nbsp; Many have not yet.&nbsp; But we&#8217;ve started &#8212; kicked off this one-month campaign to do everything we can to reach it.&nbsp; And we&#8217;ll see where we get.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve got some time.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, in Israel, the Knesset just approved the new coalition which would end Benjamin Netanyahu&#8217;s 12-year run, I think.&nbsp; Can the White House comment on that?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We will have a statement shortly that should be out to all of you.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Has the President spoken to the new prime minister?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&#8217;t believe he has yet, but he will soon.&nbsp; And we&#8217;ll get you with the statement and a readout if that happens, whenever that happens.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What’s the President&#8217;s message to the American public about the Delta variant and how concerned they should be?&nbsp; I mean, he tweeted about it the other day.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you say anything more about, you know, what the administration is doing specifically to address that?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; Well, the spread of the Delta variant and the prevalence of it is one of the reasons why we are making clear to people who have not been vaccinated &#8212; specifically people under 40; it&#8217;s a big gap, as you all know, between the percentages of people over 40 versus under &#8212; of what &#8212; how high the risk is from the Delta variant.&nbsp; It spreads, it&#8217;s very transmissible, and this should be another incentive for young people to get vaccinated.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So we are working to elevate that as a concern because we want people to be aware of the risks.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Great.&nbsp; Thanks, everyone.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.<br>&nbsp;<br>8:41 P.M. BST</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong><em>The United States and our G7 Partners are rallying to defeat COVID-19 through historic financing, donations, and capacity building, demonstrating how democracies can provide for our people and the world.</em></strong></p>



<p>This week in Cornwall, the United States and G7+ Leaders announced more than one billion safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines to accelerate global coverage. This announcement means that since 2020, the G7+ has committed to financing and providing approximately 2.3 billion vaccines for the world. The United States is providing nearly half of that support and is the single largest COVID-19 vaccine donor in the world. This 2.3 billion total includes support for expanding local production capacity around the world to add more than a billion doses to the global vaccine supply by the end of 2022. &nbsp;<br><br><strong>Earlier Financing and Sharing: </strong>G7+ countries have previously committed to finance and share more than 1 billion doses.</p>



<ul><li>Since the inception of COVAX, G7+ countries have previously committed more than <strong><u>1 billion doses</u></strong> through COVAX to date in direct financing and doses.&nbsp;<br></li><li>This includes more than 330 million dose equivalents from the United States in funding for COVAX and at least 80 million U.S. vaccines donated to the world from surplus supply.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Local Vaccine Production Investments: </strong>G7+ investment in local vaccine production capacity will support at least 1 billion vaccine doses by the end of 2022.</p>



<ul><li>Through partnerships like the Quad Vaccine Partnership of the United States, India, Japan, and Australia, the G7+ is committed to expanding local production for at least<strong><u> 1 billion doses</u></strong> of safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines in 2021 and 2022.<br></li><li>The U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) is driving this effort and is also working with peer Development Finance Institutions including the International Finance Corporation, Proparco, and DEG to support vaccine manufacturing in Africa – for Africa.</li></ul>



<p><strong>This week: </strong>The G7+ agreed to provide an additional more than 1 billion doses starting summer 2021.</p>



<ul><li>This week in Cornwall, G7+ Leaders agreed to provide at least <strong><u>1 billion doses</u></strong> of safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines to accelerate global vaccine coverage, particularly for the poorest countries.<br></li><li>The United States announced its commitment to purchase and contribute to Gavi or in support of COVAX <strong>500 million doses</strong> of Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, with delivery beginning in August 2021, as its portion of approximately half of the overall G7+ commitment. The U.S. will allocate these doses to 92 low and lower-middle income nations around the world. <strong>This is the world’s largest-ever purchase and donation of vaccines by a single country.</strong></li></ul>



<p>The United States calls on countries to donate additional doses of safe and effective vaccines, strengthen vaccine readiness, and work with private sector partners to vaccinate the world. In addition to support for the G7+ commitment on vaccines, the United States will continue to share doses from our domestic supply as they become available.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>“The transatlantic alliance is the strong foundation on which our collective security and our shared prosperity are built.&nbsp; The partnership between Europe and the United States, in my view, is and must remain the cornerstone of all that we hope to accomplish in the 21<sup>st</sup> century, just as we did in the 20<sup>th</sup> century… The United States is fully committed to our NATO Alliance… we’ll keep faith with Article 5.”</em></p>



<p class="has-text-align-right">&nbsp;–<em> President Biden, February 19, 2021</em></p>



<p>President Biden will participate on June 14 in the NATO Summit in Brussels that brings together the leaders of all 30 Allied nations. &nbsp;During the Summit, the President will reaffirm the enduring Transatlantic bond through NATO and underscore the United States’ ironclad commitment to Article 5 – an attack on one is an attack on all and will be met with a collective response.&nbsp; Allied leaders will launch an ambitious set of initiatives to ensure NATO continues to provide security to our citizens through 2030 and beyond.</p>



<p>The Transatlantic relationship is built on a foundation of shared democratic values.&nbsp; NATO’s strength comes not only from its military might, but also its unity and common purpose founded on respect for democracy, individual liberty, and the rule of law, as enshrined in the Washington Treaty.&nbsp; Now in its 73rd year, NATO is the most powerful and successful Alliance in history.&nbsp; NATO faced down the Communist bloc in the Cold War and today provides security for approximately one billion people in Europe and North America.&nbsp; As NATO winds down its military presence in Afghanistan after nearly 20 years, the United States and our NATO Allies and partners will continue supporting the people of Afghanistan through civilian and security assistance.&nbsp; The United States will also continue to stand shoulder to shoulder with our Allies and partners in NATO’s non-combat advisory mission in Iraq.</p>



<p>NATO played a pivotal role in coordinating the civilian response to COVID-19, airlifting hundreds of tons of critical supplies around the world and building almost 100 field hospitals, while maintaining its deterrence and defense posture.&nbsp; This assistance is saving lives and proves that defense investment and capacity building increase our nations’ resilience in the face of all kinds of crises, not only against military threats.</p>



<p><strong><u>Key Summit Outcomes</u></strong>:</p>



<p><strong>A New Strategic Concept</strong>:&nbsp; Allies will agree to revise NATO’s Strategic Concept, a framework that will guide the Alliance’s approach to the evolving strategic environment, which includes Russia’s aggressive policies and actions; challenges posed by the People’s Republic of China to our collective security, prosperity, and values; and transnational threats such as terrorism, cyber threats, and climate change. &nbsp;The new Strategic Concept will be prepared for adoption at the NATO Summit in 2022.</p>



<p><strong>Updating Cyber Defenses</strong>: Leaders will endorse a new Cyber Defense Policy for NATO that will strengthen Allied coordination to ensure the Alliance is resilient against the increasingly frequent and severe threats we face from malicious cyber activity perpetrated by state and non-state actors, including disruptive ransomware attacks against critical infrastructure.&nbsp; This updated policy will also provide strategic guidance for NATO’s political, military, and technical cyber efforts to deter, defend against, and counter the full spectrum of cyber threats.&nbsp; Leaders will also affirm the importance of defending our networks and ensuring Allies rely on trustworthy providers for next generation telecommunication networks.</p>



<p><strong>Preserving our Technological Edge</strong>:&nbsp; Leaders will affirm that NATO’s ability to ensure our common defense relies on maintaining our technological edge. &nbsp;Allies will launch a Defense Innovation Accelerator to facilitate their technological cooperation and speed the adoption of emerging technologies that will enhance the Alliance’s defense and security.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Combatting Climate Change</strong>:&nbsp; Leaders will agree to a Climate Security Action Plan and set the ambition for NATO to become the leading international organization for understanding and adapting to the impact of climate change on security. &nbsp;They will agree to reduce greenhouse gases from military activities and installations in line with national commitments under the Paris Agreement, and agree to initiate a regular high-level global climate and security dialogue.</p>



<p><strong>Strengthened Deterrence and Defense</strong>:&nbsp; Allies will commit to implementation of new military concepts and strategies that strengthen NATO’s deterrence and defense posture to meet threats from Russia and elsewhere.&nbsp; NATO also continues to monitor the Russian deployments in and around Ukraine.</p>



<p><strong>Greater Sharing of Responsibility</strong>:  Non-U.S. defense spending has risen for seven consecutive years since the Wales Defense Investment Pledge adopted during the Obama-Biden Administration in 2014.  Allied leaders will recommit to the Wales Pledge in its entirety and to providing NATO with cash, capabilities, and contributions of ready forces.</p>



<p><strong>Investing in NATO:</strong>&nbsp; Allies will also commit to ensuring NATO is led, staffed, and resourced at levels necessary to deliver on the decisions taken at the Summit.&nbsp; Leaders will agree to identify the additional resources, including through NATO common funding, to enhance NATO’s ability to meet security challenges today and in the future.</p>



<p><strong>Increased Consultation and Cohesion</strong>:&nbsp; Allies will commit to enhance political coordination at NATO on all matters related to their individual and collective security.&nbsp; Leaders will also reaffirm their commitment to their common values, including individual liberty, human rights, democracy, and the rule of law.</p>



<p><strong>Stronger Societies</strong>:&nbsp; Recognizing the increasingly complex threats to our security, Allied leaders will affirm that national and collective resilience are essential for credible deterrence and defense, and vital to safeguard our societies, citizens, and shared values.&nbsp; Allied leaders will issue a Strengthened Resilience Commitment to outline future priorities, including on the security of supply chains, critical infrastructure, and energy networks, as well as preparedness for pandemics and natural disasters.</p>



<p><strong>Deeper Partnerships</strong>:&nbsp; Allies will enhance NATO’s ability to strengthen the rules-based international order by increasing dialogue and practical cooperation with the Alliance’s partners, including the European Union and those in the Indo-Pacific (Australia, Japan, New Zealand, and the Republic of Korea).&nbsp; Leaders will recommit to NATO’s Open Door Policy, which provides a path to membership for any European country that shares our values and meets the necessary responsibilities and obligations.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Cornwall Airport Newquay<br>Cornwall, United Kingdom</p>



<p>2:52 P.M. BST<br>&nbsp;<br>THE PRESIDENT: Well, good afternoon. And let me start by thanking Prime Minister Johnson for the incredible hospitality and welcome that he provided for all of us at the G7. I’d like to take &#8212; thank Yael Lempert, who is our chargé at the embassy, filling in for the ambassador &#8212; an ambassador; we&#8217;ll have one soon. But she did a great job supporting the entire team, and Yael is vital to keeping this UK-U.S. partnership going and moving smoothly as it is now.<br>&nbsp;<br>We&#8217;ve just wrapped up what has been an extraordinary, collaborative, and productive meeting at the G7. Everyone at the table understood and understands both the seriousness and the challenges that we&#8217;re up against, and the responsibility of our proud democracies to step up and deliver for the rest of the world. That&#8217;s what the G7 is all about. And rallying the world&#8217;s democracies to meet the challenges that the world faces, and deliver for our people and for people, quite frankly, everywhere.<br>&nbsp;<br>Ending the pandemic and maintaining robust support for an equitable, inclusive global economic recovery were the top priorities of our nations as we got together. We know we can&#8217;t achieve one without the other; that is, we have to deal with the pandemic and &#8212; in order to be able to deal with economic recovery, which &#8212; as we&#8217;re doing in the States, but we committed that we&#8217;re going to do more for the rest of the world as well.<br>&nbsp;<br>The fact is that we &#8212; the U.S. contribution is the foundation &#8212; the foundation to work out how we&#8217;re going to deal with the 100 nations that are poor and having trouble finding vaccines and having trouble dealing with reviving their economies if they were, in the first place, in good shape.<br>&nbsp;<br>And we &#8212; I committed that we would provide a half a billion &#8212; a half a billion beyond the 80 million we&#8217;ve already done &#8212; half a billion doses of Pfizer vaccine, which we contracted to pay for, in addition to money we put into the COVID [COVAX] project, which is that COVID [COVAX] is &#8212; and I know you all know, but a lot of people may not know what COVID [COVAX] is &#8212; that is a system whereby they&#8217;re going to provide funding for states to be able to get access to vaccines on their own, as well.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>But the bottom line is: What that generated was a commitment by the rest of our colleagues at the G7 that they would provide another half billion. So we&#8217;re going to have a billion doses of vaccine.<br>&nbsp;<br>And, in our case, this includes sharing more than &#8212; not just the one billion doses overall, but we&#8217;re going to provide for 200 million of those doses by the end of the year, another 300 million by the first half of next year. And so, it&#8217;s &#8212; it was greeted with some enthusiasm.<br>&nbsp;<br>And we&#8217;ve agreed to work together so that the world is better prepared to detect and deal with future pandemics, because there will be future pandemics.<br>&nbsp;<br>We have a &#8212; I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve seen it; if you haven&#8217;t, you&#8217;ll get it &#8212; a joint statement we put out of the G7. You&#8217;ve seen it, I&#8217;m sure. And we are committed to follow on to do some significant work, including not only how we deal with the distribution and help in getting shots in arms to the rest of the world, but how we&#8217;re going to deal with putting together a mechanism to anticipate and deal with and be aware of the next &#8212; the next pandemic when it comes along. And there will be others.<br>&nbsp;<br>And we also agreed to take important steps that are going to support global economic recovery by laying the foundation for an equitable global economy. Critically, the G7 leaders endorsed a global minimum tax of 15 percent. So many corporations have been engaged in what are essentially tax havens, deciding that they would pay considerably less than other &#8212; in other environs around the world. And &#8212; but this is going to make sure there&#8217;s a minimum tax, and I&#8217;m going to have &#8212; I&#8217;m going to move on this at home as well &#8212; a minimum tax for corporations to pay for the profits they make anywhere in the world.<br>&nbsp;<br>And this agreement is going to help arrest the race to the bottom that&#8217;s been going on among nations attracting corporate investment at the expense of priorities like protecting our workers and investing in infrastructure.<br>&nbsp;<br>We also made a momentous commitment at the G7 to help meet more than a $40 trillion need that exists for infrastructure in the developing world. I put forward an idea that was called &#8212; we named the &#8220;Build Back Better World Partnership,&#8221; which is &#8212; we&#8217;re calling it the &#8220;B3W.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;<br>The point is that what&#8217;s happening is that China has this Belt and Road Initiative, and we think that there&#8217;s a much more equitable way to provide for the needs of countries around the world.<br>&nbsp;<br>And so it&#8217;s been &#8212; it&#8217;s a values-driven, high-standard, transparent financing mechanism we&#8217;re going to provide and support projects in four key are- &#8212; key areas: climate, health, digital technology, and gender equity. And we believe that will not only be good for the countries, but it’ll be good for the entire world and represent values that our democracies represent, and not autocratic lack of values. By harassing the full potential of those who are harassing, we&#8217;re going to have to try and change things. That&#8217;s the whole idea.<br>&nbsp;<br>But here&#8217;s the deal: We&#8217;re going to make sure that we are able to pull together the ability to use the development financing institutions and other development tools to expect the bold, new infrastructure investment in low- and middle-income countries over the coming years, much of it coming from the private sector, which will generate the capital put in; will generate significantly more capital from the private sector.<br>&nbsp;<br>We also made a historic commitment to permanently eliminate the use of our public finance to support unabated coal projects around the world, and to end &#8212; and to end them by this year. The G7 agreed to that. And those who are not members, but visiting members who are participating in the G7, who have coal-fired facilities have also agreed that they would work in that direction as well.<br>&nbsp;<br>So, transitioning the world to cleaner energy sources is urgent, it&#8217;s essential if we&#8217;re going to beat the climate. And there is &#8212; one of the things I &#8212; some of my colleagues said to me when I was there was, “Well, the United States is &#8212; their leadership recognizes there is global warming.” And I know that sounds silly, but, you know, we had a President who last &#8212; who basically said it&#8217;s not a problem &#8212; global warming. It is the existential problem facing humanity, and it&#8217;s being treated that way. So we&#8217;re going to provide up to $2 billion to support developing company [sic] &#8212; countries as they transition away from unabated coal-fired power.<br>&nbsp;<br>In addition, we also agreed to tackle corruption, which is a threat to societies everywhere. I pointed out in a conversation I had with &#8212; with one of the leaders of &#8212; well, actually with China. And that was &#8212; it was a request for me not to try to &#8212; when I was asked what I was going to be doing after being elected, I said we&#8217;re going to reestablish the strength of American relationships so we can be counted on again &#8212; alliances &#8212; and suggested that, “Well, maybe you shouldn&#8217;t get the Quad…” &#8212; meaning India, Japan, Australia, and the United States &#8212; &#8220;…working together, and maybe you shouldn&#8217;t be pushing on strengthening the European Union to deal with the West not just to have…&#8221; &#8212; and so on.<br>&nbsp;<br>And I said, for an American president to &#8212; every president to be sustained, or prime minister, has to represent the values of their country. And I pointed out &#8212; and I mean this sincerely: We&#8217;re unique as a country. We&#8217;re built on &#8212; we&#8217;re unique in a sense that we&#8217;re not based on ethnicity or geography or religion; we’re one nation that said we organized on an idea: &#8220;We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men and women are created equal.&#8221; It sounds corny, but it&#8217;s real.<br>&nbsp;<br>And any President who doesn&#8217;t act consistent with what the &#8212; the raison d&#8217;état for the nation is cannot be sustained that &#8212; the support of that country.<br>&nbsp;<br>And so what we were able to do is: We know that corruption undermines the trust in governments, siphons off public resources, makes economies much less competitive, and constitutes a threat to our security. So we&#8217;re going to work together to address issues like the abuse of shell companies and money laundering through real estate transactions. And we&#8217;ve agreed that we’re going to work together to address cyber threats from state and non-state actors like criminal ransomware networks, and hold count- &#8212; countries accountable that harbor criminal ransomware actors who don&#8217;t hold them accountable.<br>&nbsp;<br>And over the past few weeks, the nations of the G7 have affirmed that democratic values that underpin everything we hope to achieve in our shared future, that we&#8217;re committed to put them to work: One, delivering vaccines and ending the pandemic. Two, driving substantial, inclusive economic recovery around the world. Three, in fueling infrastructure development in places that most badly need it. And, four, in fighting climate change.<br>&nbsp;<br>The only way we&#8217;re going to meet the global threats that we&#8217;re &#8212; is by working together, and with our partners and our allies. And I conveyed to each of my G7 counterparts that the United States is going to do our part. America is back at the table. It’s &#8212; America is back at the table.<br>&nbsp;<br>The lack of participation in the past and full engagement was noticed significantly, not only by the leaders of those countries, but by the people in the G7 countries. And America is back in the business of leading the world alongside nations who share our most deeply held values.<br>&nbsp;<br>And so the bottom line is: I was very pleased with the &#8212; with the outcome of the &#8212; of the entire conference. And, you know, I noticed there was a lot of coverage of my individual comments made by my colleagues about how we were all getting along together. But the truth of the matter is: We did. It wasn’t &#8212; I felt it wasn&#8217;t about me, but it was about America. I felt a genuine sense of enthusiasm that America was back at the table and fully, fully engaged.<br>&nbsp;<br>And now I&#8217;m going to be heading off to &#8212; to Brussels, to NATO. And the same &#8212; many of the same people are going to be at that table, and &#8212; in NATO &#8212; and to make the case we are back, as well. We do not view NATO as a sort of a protection racket. We believe that NATO is vital to our ability to maintain American security for the next &#8212; next &#8212; the remainder of the century. And there&#8217;s a real enthusiasm.<br>&nbsp;<br>I made it clear &#8212; and I pointed out, and I thanked them &#8212; you know, Article 5 is, “An attack on one is an attack on all.” Well, what Americans sometimes &#8212; don&#8217;t forget &#8212; remember what happened on 9/11. We were attacked. Immediately, NATO supported us. NATO supported us. NATO went until we got bin Laden. NATO was part of the process. And I want them to know, unlike &#8212; whether they doubt it &#8212; that we believe NATO and Section [Article] 5 is a sacred obligation.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Bottom line is: I think &#8212; I think we&#8217;ve made some progress in reestablishing American credibility among our closest friends and our &#8212; our values.<br>&nbsp;<br>Now, why don&#8217;t I take some of your questions? And I&#8217;m told, Jonathan, I&#8217;m supposed to talk &#8212; recognize you first.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp; Well, I appreciate &#8212; I appreciate that, sir. Thank you very much. Mr. President, Vladimir Putin &#8212; (a microphone is brought to Mr. Lemire) &#8212; thank you.<br>&nbsp;<br>Vladimir Putin, who you&#8217;ll be seeing in a few days in Geneva, said just a couple of days ago that he believed that U.S.-Russia relations were at a low point. In what concrete ways could your summit change that?<br>&nbsp;<br>And then, secondly, on the same topic: You have said previously, and in the run-up to the summit, that you would be unafraid to call out Russia&#8217;s disruptive actions &#8212; like cyber hacks, Ukraine, election interference &#8212; but you&#8217;re not having a joint press conference with Putin. Why not take the chance to stand side by side with him and say those things to him with the world watching?<br>&nbsp;<br>THE PRESIDENT: (Laughs.) Well, let me make it clear: I think he&#8217;s right that it&#8217;s a low point, and it depends on how he responds to acting consistent with international norms, which, in many cases, he has not.<br>&nbsp;<br>As I told him when I was running and when I got elected, before it was &#8212; I was sworn in, that I was going to find out whether or not he, in fact, did engage in trying to interfere in our election; that I was going to take a look at whether he was involved in the &#8212; a cybersecurity breach that occurred, et cetera; and if I did, I was going to respond.<br>&nbsp;<br>I did; I checked it out. So, I had access to all the intelligence. He was engaged in those activities. I did respond and made it clear that I&#8217;d respond again.<br>&nbsp;<br>With regard to &#8212; I always found &#8212; and I don&#8217;t mean to suggest that the press should not know &#8212; but this is not a contest about who can do better in front of a press conference to try to embarrass each other. It&#8217;s about making myself very clear what the conditions are to get a better relationship are &#8212; with Russia.<br>&nbsp;<br>We&#8217;re not looking for conflict. We are looking to resolve those actions which we think are inconsistent with international norms, number one. Number two, where we can work together, we may be able to do that in terms of some strategic doctrine that &#8212; that may be able to be worked together. We&#8217;re ready to do it. And there may be other areas. There&#8217;s even talk there may be the ability to work together on climate.<br>&nbsp;<br>So the bottom line is that I think the best way to deal with this is for he and I to meet, he and I to have our discussion. I know you don&#8217;t doubt that I&#8217;ll be very straightforward &#8212; (laughs) &#8212; with him about our concerns. And I will make clear my view of how that meeting turned out, and he&#8217;ll make clear how &#8212; from his perspective, how it turned out.<br>&nbsp;<br>But I don&#8217;t want to get into being diverted by, &#8220;Did they shake hands? How far did they ta- &#8212; who talked the most,” and the rest. Now,&nbsp;he can say what he said the meeting was about, and I will say what I think the meeting was about.<br>&nbsp;<br>That&#8217;s &#8212; that&#8217;s how I&#8217;m going to handle it.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp; Okay, thanks.<br>&nbsp;<br>THE PRESIDENT: I&#8217;m sorry, I&#8217;m going to get in trouble with staff if I don’t do this the right way.<br>&nbsp;<br>Jennifer Jacobs, Bloomberg.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp; Thank you, sir. On China, you &#8212; sorry &#8212; China seems to be to doing exactly what it wants to do with regard to Hong Kong, with regard to Xinjiang, with the South China Sea, and many other issues, despite pressure from you and from allies.<br>&nbsp;<br>The final language in the G7 communiqué does have some mentions of China, which is different from past years, but I know it&#8217;s not as tough as you and your team wanted it to be. We&#8217;ve saw &#8212; we saw a draft of the communiqué, and it&#8217;s not quite as tough.<br>&nbsp;<br>So why isn&#8217;t it as tough? There isn&#8217;t very much action in it. There&#8217;s some calls for China to be respectful. But why isn&#8217;t that communiqué a little bit tougher? Are you disappointed in that? And what can you do to change some of these actions by China?<br>&nbsp;<br>THE PRESIDENT: Well, first of all, I think it &#8212; as you know, last time the G7 met, there was no mention of China. But this time, there is mention of China. The G7 explicitly agreed to call out human rights abuses in Xinjiang and in Hong Kong explicitly.<br>&nbsp;<br>Two, to coordinate a common strategy to deal with China non-market policies that undermine competition. They&#8217;ve agreed &#8212; and that&#8217;s underway now &#8212; how to do that.<br>&nbsp;<br>Three, to take serious actions against forced labor in solar, agriculture, and the garment industries because that&#8217;s where it&#8217;s happening. And they&#8217;ve agreed we will do that.<br>&nbsp;<br>To launch &#8212; what I said earlier; I really feel very strongly &#8212; I proposed that we have a democratic alternative to the Belt and Road Initiative: the Build Back Better. And they&#8217;ve agreed to that, and that&#8217;s underway as the details of that &#8212; we agreed that we’d put together a committee to do that and come up with that.<br>&nbsp;<br>And thirdly, that we are going to insist on a high-standards to be &#8212; for a climate-friendly, transparent alternative to the Belt and Road Initiative. And &#8212; but, in the meantime, we&#8217;re going to move forward.<br>&nbsp;<br>Look, I think it&#8217;s always &#8212; let me put it this way: I know this is going sound somewhat prosaic, but I think we&#8217;re in a contest &#8212; not with China per se, but a contest with autocrats, autocratic governments around the world, as to whether or not democracies can compete with them in the rapidly changing 21st century.<br>&nbsp;<br>And I think how we act and whether we pull together as democracies is going to determine whether our grandkids look back 15 years from now and say, &#8220;Did they step up? Are democracies as relevant and as powerful as they have been?&#8221;<br>&nbsp;<br>And I walked away from the meeting with all my colleagues believing that they are convinced that that is correct now too. Not &#8212; I shouldn&#8217;t say &#8220;now”. Not just because of me, but they believe that to be the case.<br>&nbsp;<br>And so, I think you&#8217;re going to see just straightforward dealing with China. And again, we&#8217;re not looking &#8212; as I&#8217;ve told Xi Jinping myself, I&#8217;m not looking for conflict. Where we can cooperate, we&#8217;ll cooperate. Where we disagree, I&#8217;m going to state it frankly, and we are going to respond to actions that are inconsistent.<br>&nbsp;<br>For example, we talked about trade. It&#8217;s one thing to talk about whether or not our agricultural policy makes sense. It’s another thing to say, “By the way, you&#8217;re demanding that if I do business with your country, I&#8217;ve got to give you all my trade secrets and have the &#8212; the Chinese partner have 51 percent of that?” No. Not us.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp; So, are you saying, Mr. President &#8212; are you satisfied with what came out in the communiqué?<br>&nbsp;<br>THE PRESIDENT: Yes.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp; Or do you wish it were tougher? Do you wish there was more &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>THE PRESIDENT: Yes.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp; &#8212; action on China?<br>&nbsp;<br>THE PRESIDENT: I think there&#8217;s plenty of action on China, and there&#8217;s always something that you can &#8212; I&#8217;m sure my colleagues think there&#8217;s things they think they can improve that they wanted. But I&#8217;m satisfied.<br>&nbsp;<br>Steve Holland, Reuters.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp; Thank you, sir. Just to follow up on Jennifer’s question: The communiqué cited a variety of fronts on China, everything from human rights, the origin of the COVID virus, Taiwan. What do you think China needs to do to ease tensions?<br>&nbsp;<br>THE PRESIDENT: I think China has to start to act more responsibly in terms of international norms on human rights and transparency.<br>&nbsp;<br>Transparency matters across the board. And I think the idea that &#8212; for example, one of the things I raised and others raised &#8212; I wasn&#8217;t the only one who raised this at the G7 &#8212; is that we don&#8217;t know &#8212; we haven&#8217;t had access to the laboratories to determine whether or not &#8212; and I have not reached a conclusion because our intelligence community is not certain yet whether or not this was a consequence of a &#8212; from the marketplace of a bat, you know, interfacing with &#8212; with animals in the environment that caused this &#8212; this COVID-19, or whether it was an experiment gone awry in a laboratory.<br>&nbsp;<br>It&#8217;s important to know the answer to that because we have to have access &#8212; we have to build a system whereby we can know what &#8212; when we see another transparent &#8212; lack of transparency that might produce another vac- &#8212; another pandemic. We have to have access. The world has to have access.<br>&nbsp;<br>So we&#8217;re trying to figure out, at the G7, whether we could put together an international basis upon which we could have a bottom line with what the transparency accounted for.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp; And you mentioned &#8212; you mentioned that the argument behind the scenes, that you had not mentioned China in three years in one of these communiqués. What did you argue behind the scenes to try to bring people to the point where they got?<br>&nbsp;<br>THE PRESIDENT: To answer that question &#8212; there&#8217;s no way to answer without sounding self-serving. Let me just say this: I just laid out what I thought was the need for us to be consistent to protect our economies and to see to it that other struggling economies, who needed help, got the help and were not held captive by other nations.<br>&nbsp;<br>But you might ask that to others. I&#8217;m not trying to be a wise guy, but I &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>And Wall Street Journal. Andrew.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp; As you said, the G7 countries committed to send 1 billion coronavirus doses overseas, but the World Health Organization says 11 billion doses are needed.<br>&nbsp;<br>THE PRESIDENT: Yes.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp; How are you going to bridge that gap? Will the U.S. commit to send additional doses overseas? And given the gap, is it actually realistic to end the pandemic by 2022?<br>&nbsp;<br>THE PRESIDENT: It is &#8212; it may take slightly longer than &#8212; worldwide. But the United States is going to continue &#8212; I think there&#8217;s a possibility, over 2022 going into 2023, that we would be able to be in a position to provide another billion &#8212; us. But that&#8217;s not done yet.<br>&nbsp;<br>I only &#8212; I&#8217;ve been very careful, as I&#8217;ve dealt with this pandemic, to tell you what I know and say what I thought could be done, and when I&#8217;ve announced that I&#8217;ve gone and done it. What I don&#8217;t want to do is be getting too far ahead in suggesting that we can do things and I can do things &#8212; the United States can do things that I don&#8217;t have done yet.<br>&nbsp;<br>So, I &#8212; there was a clear consensus among all our colleagues at the G7 that this wasn&#8217;t the end; we were going to stay at it until we&#8217;re able to provide for &#8212; able to provide for the needs of the whole world, in terms &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>Because, look, it&#8217;s not just the right thing to do. And from a &#8212; from a &#8212; how can I say it? From a &#8212; from a moral standpoint. But it is also the correct thing to do, in terms of our own health, our own security. You can&#8217;t build a wall high enough to keep out new strains. You can&#8217;t do that.<br>&nbsp;<br>And so, I think this is going to be a constant project for a long time. And there may be other pandemics. We &#8212; again, setting up a system whereby we can detect &#8212; before it gets out of control &#8212; one, a pandemic, that may be on the horizon &#8212; a virus &#8212; is important.<br>&nbsp;<br>So, we are not going to &#8212; as long as there&#8217;s nations in need that &#8212; being able to be vaccinated, we in fact &#8212; not &#8212; not only that: We&#8217;ve been engaged in helping &#8212; which I&#8217;ve made clear, and most of our &#8212; my colleagues understood it. I mean, they understood it &#8212; knew it from trying it themselves. This is a gigantic logistical effort. It&#8217;s one thing to send nation X, X number &#8212; Y number of vaccines. It&#8217;s another thing to have the people that can actually get it in somebody&#8217;s arm. And so, we are also providing the ability for other countries to manufacture their vaccines. We&#8217;ve all agreed on that.<br>&nbsp;<br>India has the capacity to do that. They don&#8217;t have the material capacity thus far to do the manufacturing. But there&#8217;s a lot going on to provide &#8212; not only to, quote, &#8220;give&#8221; vaccines, but to provide the ability of the countries in question to produce their own vaccines.<br>&nbsp;<br>AIDE: Last question. Last question.<br>&nbsp;<br>THE PRESIDENT: I&#8217;m not going to answer anything. No, I&#8217;m joking. Last question. Peter Alexander, NBC News.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp; Mr. President, thank you very much. About Vladimir Putin and your meeting this week: As you&#8217;re well aware, the U.S. has been slapping sanctions on Russia for years for its malign activities, and Russia has not stopped. So what specifically will you do differently to change Vladimir Putin&#8217;s behavior?<br>&nbsp;<br>THE PRESIDENT: Well, first of all, there&#8217;s no guarantee you can change a person&#8217;s behavior or the behavior of his country. Autocrats have enormous power and they don&#8217;t have to answer to a public. &nbsp;And the fact is that it may very well be, if I respond in kind &#8212; which I will &#8212; that it doesn&#8217;t dissuade him and he wants to keep going.<br>&nbsp;<br>But I think that we&#8217;re going to be moving in a direction where Russia has &#8212; has its own dilemmas, let us say, dealing with its economy, dealing with its &#8212; dealing with COVID, and dealing with not only the United States, but Europe writ large and in the Middle East.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And so, there&#8217;s a lot going on where we can work together with Russia. For example, in Libya, we should be opening up the passes to be able to go through and provide &#8212; provide food assistance and economic &#8212; I mean, vital assistance to a population that&#8217;s in real trouble.<br>&nbsp;<br>I think I&#8217;m going to try very much &#8212; hard to &#8212; it is &#8212; and, by the way, there&#8217;s places where &#8212; I shouldn&#8217;t be starting off on negotiating in public here. But let me say it this way: Russia has engaged in activities which are &#8212; we believe are contrary to international norms, but they have also bitten off some real problems they&#8217;re going to have trouble chewing on.<br>&nbsp;<br>And, for example, the rebuilding of &#8212; of Syria, of Libya, of &#8212; you know, this is &#8212; they&#8217;re there. And as long as they&#8217;re there without the ability to bring about some order in the &#8212; in the region, and you can&#8217;t do that very well without providing for the basic economic needs of people.<br>&nbsp;<br>So I&#8217;m hopeful that we can find an accommodation that &#8211;where we can save the lives of people in &#8212; for example, in &#8212; in Libya, that &#8212; consistent with the interest of &#8212; maybe for different reasons &#8212; but reached it for the same reason &#8212; the same result.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp; I want to ask you about a comment that Vladimir Putin said today. But why do you think he hasn&#8217;t changed his behavior in spite of everything the U.S. has done to this point?<br>&nbsp;<br>THE PRESIDENT: (Laughs.) He&#8217;s Vladimir Putin.<br>&nbsp;<br>I&#8217;m not going to get into much more than that, because I&#8217;ve got to sit down with him. And I&#8217;ll be happy to talk to you after that. But &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp; But he said &#8212; then, just to conclude &#8212; today, he said that Russia would be ready to hand over cyber criminals to the United States if the U.S. would do the same to Russia and an agreement came out of this meeting coming up. So, are you open to that kind of a trade with Vladimir Putin?<br>&nbsp;<br>THE PRESIDENT: Yes, I&#8217;m open to &#8212; if there&#8217;s crimes committed against Russia that, in fact, are &#8212; and the people committing those crimes are being harbored in the United States &#8212; I&#8217;m committed to holding them accountable. And I&#8217;m &#8212; I heard that; I was told, as I was flying here, that he said that. I think that&#8217;s &#8212; that&#8217;s potentially a good sign and progress.<br>&nbsp;<br>Thank you all very, very much. Thank you.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp; May I ask, sir, (inaudible) &#8212; (off mic.) The European allies &#8212; can I ask a question about the European allies?<br>&nbsp;<br>THE PRESIDENT: (Laughs.) I&#8217;m going to get in trouble with my pre- &#8212; my staff. Yeah, go ahead. But pretend that I didn&#8217;t answer you.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp; Thank you very much, sir. You have often said repeatedly that &#8220;America is back.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;<br>THE PRESIDENT: Yes.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp; At the same time, you&#8217;ve kept in play some Trump-era steel and aluminum sanctions. And I wanted to ask you: When you&#8217;re having these conversations with European allies who are very concerned about these sanctions, how do you justify that? And what are your plans for &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>THE PRESIDENT: A hundred and twenty days. Give me a break. Need time.<br>&nbsp;<br>3:22 P.M. BST</p>
