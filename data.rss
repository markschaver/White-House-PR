Between Mississippi and Boston, he took a year to backpack in Europe and the Middle East. He joined <em>TheAtlanta Journal-Constitution</em> as managing editor for news in 2002 and left the paper in 2008, after which he joined Emory. Klibanoff and his wife, Laurie A. Leonard, who is a speech therapist, have three daughters: Caroline, Eleanor, and Corinne.</p>

<p>In the midst of a revolution, less than a year after declaring our independence, the Congress consecrated what would become an enduring emblem of American unity by adopting a national flag on June 14, 1777.</p>



<p>In the 244 years since, the United States has grown and changed across the generations &#8212; and our flag has changed in turn.&nbsp; The blue field of stars has been enlarged as our Union has gained in size and strength.&nbsp; The 13 stripes, symbolizing the 13 original States, have held as constant as the bedrock values upon which our Nation was first conceived &#8212; the very same values we still cherish, and still reach for, today.</p>



<p>Since adoption of the Stars and Stripes, Americans &#8212; and people around the world &#8212; have continuously looked to our flag as a symbol of unity and liberty. &nbsp;Our flag has sailed around the globe, and journeyed to the Moon and, now, to Mars.&nbsp; It has flown on fields of battle, and marks the resting places of those who have given what President Lincoln called &#8220;the last full measure of devotion&#8221; for our country. &nbsp;Its prominence at civic landmarks and seats of public authority communicates the promise of democracy &#8212; that under this flag, the rule of law is supreme and the people reign. &nbsp;As we continue the sacred work of building a more perfect Union together, let our flag serve as a&nbsp;reminder to us, and to the world, that America stands for and&nbsp;strives for the promise of freedom, justice, and equality for&nbsp;all.</p>



<p>To commemorate the adoption of our flag, the Congress, by joint resolution approved August 3, 1949, as amended (63 Stat. 492), designated June 14 of each year as &#8220;Flag Day&#8221; and requested that the President issue an annual proclamation calling for its observance and for the display of the flag of the United States on all Federal Government buildings.&nbsp; The Congress also requested, by joint resolution approved June 9, 1966, as amended (80 Stat. 194), that the President issue annually a proclamation designating the week in which June 14 occurs as &#8220;National Flag Week&#8221; and calling upon all citizens of the United States to display the flag during that week.</p>



<p>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim June 14, 2021, as Flag Day, and the week starting June 13, 2021, as National Flag Week.&nbsp; I direct the appropriate officials to display the flag on&nbsp;all Federal Government buildings during this week, and I urge all Americans to observe Flag Day and National Flag Week by displaying the flag.&nbsp; I encourage the people of the United&nbsp;States to observe with pride and all due ceremony those days from Flag Day through Independence Day, set aside by the Congress (89 Stat. 211), as a time to honor the American spirit, to celebrate our history and the foundational values we strive to uphold, and to publicly recite the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America.</p>



<p>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eleventh day of June, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-fifth.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-right"><br>                                 JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p><strong>Today, President Biden welcomed the historic commitment of the leaders of the G7 and guest countries to provide more than 1 billion additional COVID-19 vaccines for the world, starting this summer, of which the United States will contribute half a billion doses.</strong><br><br>This commitment forms the basis of a comprehensive set of G7+ actions towards ending this global pandemic in 2022. The G7+ action plan that will be agreed to by leaders in Cornwall includes vaccinating the world’s most vulnerable, providing emergency supplies, bolstering world-wide economic recovery, and positioning the international community to prepare for, prevent, detect, and respond to future biological catastrophes.&nbsp;<br><br>The United States will lead the G7+ in a global COVID-19 vaccination campaign, providing 500 million safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines for the world&nbsp;through COVAX, with delivery starting in&nbsp;August&nbsp;2021. This&nbsp;donation, which President Biden announced yesterday,&nbsp;is the largest single donation of vaccines in history and comprises half of the G7+ commitment to provide an additional 1 billion safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine doses over the next 12 months, especially to the world’s most vulnerable.<br><br>In addition,&nbsp;we are taking concrete&nbsp;and tangible steps to meet the ambition of the G7+ and drive action to end this pandemic and prevent the next.&nbsp;We call on other countries and private sector partners to join us.&nbsp;<br><br>To end the global&nbsp;COVID-19&nbsp;pandemic, the United States and the G7+ will:</p>



<ul><li><strong><u>Accelerate Vaccination of the World’s Most Vulnerable</u></strong><br><strong>We are fully committed to working towards the ambitious goal of ending the pandemic. </strong>Yesterday’s announcement of half a billion new vaccine doses comes on top of both the at least 80 million vaccine doses previously announced by President Biden and the $2 billion in funding which the United States has previously provided to Gavi to support COVAX. We call on countries to donate additional doses of safe and effective vaccines, strengthen vaccine readiness, and work with private sector partners to vaccinate the world. <br> </li><li><strong><u>Support Last Mile Vaccination and Getting Shots into Arms</u></strong><br>The Biden-Harris Administration will be providing hundreds of millions in support for programs that provide assistance to help countries and health systems prepare for vaccination around the world, including in Latin America, Asia, and Africa. That assistance comes on top of longstanding U.S. support for countries and communities around the world for immunization and strengthening health systems. <br> </li><li><strong><u>Save Lives Now with PPE and Emergency Medical Supplies</u></strong><br>The Biden-Harris Administration is investing in efforts to help fragile countries with their emergency response, including lifesaving medical and other supplies to tackle COVID-19 surges while strengthening their health systems, building capacity to manage surges, and preventing disease spread. We must expand our emergency responses, including by delivering lifesaving medical supplies, oxygen, diagnostics, therapeutics, and PPE. We are providing emergency assistance in 2021 to regions that need it most, including sending multiple flights and more than $100 million in health assistance to India, and supporting responses in South Asia and Latin America as countries experience surges in COVID-19 cases. <br><br>Through the $11.5 billion provided in the American Rescue Plan (ARP) for the global COVID-19 response, we will continue to strengthen our global response to and recovery from COVID-19, including by expanding investments in lifesaving medical supplies, including oxygen, diagnostics, therapeutics, and PPE. We urge the World Bank Group and the other Multilateral Development Banks to increase the speed of their financial support to the response.<br> </li><li><strong><u>Boosting Global Supply and Supporting Surge Capacity</u></strong><br>We must increase our investments in local production capacity for safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines, therapeutics, raw materials, diagnostics, and medical supplies. We will help develop and sustain a global vaccine supply network for this pandemic and the next.<br><br>The Biden-Harris Administration is investing, through the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC), in local production capacity for safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines, which will support at least 1 billion vaccine doses by the end of 2022. This includes our efforts through the Quad Vaccine Partnership of the United States, India, Japan, and Australia, and with peer Development Finance Institutions including the IFC, Proparco, and DEG to support vaccine manufacturing in Africa – for Africa. We strongly support the aim of developing a regional network of surge capacity to produce medical countermeasures, PPE, and other lifesaving treatments and supplies.</li></ul>



<p>We recognize that the above immediate actions to end the pandemic contribute to our collective longer-term preparedness. We are committed to developing sustainable surge capacity in every region to scale up medical countermeasures and supply production on a “no regrets” basis at the first sign of a health crisis.</p>



<p>Simultaneously, we will&nbsp;work&nbsp;expeditiously to&nbsp;advance global health security to prevent future biological catastrophes:</p>



<ul><li><strong><u>Transform Disease Surveillance and Early Warning</u></strong><br>We must substantially strengthen the rapid detection of infectious disease threats. We will support the establishment of a coordinated global surveillance network to improve disease forecasting and surveillance, enable swift detection of pathogens, and translate early detection into action. We commit to accelerate development, production, and deployment of safe and effective countermeasures within 100 days.<br><br>The Biden-Harris Administration is investing $500 million from the ARP to modernize public health data and infrastructure including establishing a new Center for Epidemic Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which will help lead a new global pandemic early warning network. The American Jobs Plan (AJP) includes $30 billion toward building U.S. pandemic readiness, including by accelerating our ability to develop, produce, and deploy safe and effective countermeasures within 100 days. <br> </li><li><strong><u>Advance Global Health Security</u></strong><br>We must work with other countries and private sector partners to reach agreement by the 2021 UN General Assembly on the creation of a catalytic global health security financing mechanism and for its sustainable funding. We also commit to establishing the needed governance, oversight, accountability and transparency for future health security threats. The Biden-Harris Administration is spearheading an effort, building a coalition of public and private partners around the world, to come to consensus and establish and sustainably fund a global health security financing mechanism in 2021. We have also requested at least $250 million through the President’s Fiscal Year 2022 Budget Request to support seed funding for this mechanism this year. We look forward to progress before this year’s United Nations General Assembly, including consensus on the governance and transparency required for future health emergencies. In this regard, the Biden-Harris Administration welcomes the Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response (IPPPR) recommendation to establish a Global Health Threats Council at the UN. </li></ul>



<p>And we will go further to Build Back Better:</p>



<ul><li><strong><u>Build Resilience to Recover</u></strong><br>We will not stop with ending the pandemic:&nbsp;we&nbsp;must also&nbsp;invest in the global recovery from COVID-19.&nbsp;The Biden-Harris&nbsp;Administration strongly supports assisting&nbsp;countries&nbsp;in&nbsp;recovering&nbsp;from the pandemic’s&nbsp;aftershocks.&nbsp;We&nbsp;seek to&nbsp;reorient our development finance tools to&nbsp;strengthen health systems,&nbsp;catalyze infrastructure investment&nbsp;in&nbsp;for&nbsp;low-and middle-income countries&nbsp;and&nbsp;reverse the&nbsp;secondary impacts&nbsp;that&nbsp;have sent millions into poverty and hunger, disrupting and destabilizing education, political, economic, and social systems. We&nbsp;strongly support the effort&nbsp;to recycle&nbsp;Special Drawing Rights&nbsp;(SDRs) to further support health needs.&nbsp;We will&nbsp;also&nbsp;maintain our strong commitment to global education and strengthening the resiliency of food systems, including by mitigating the disproportionate disruptions experienced by women and girls.</li></ul>



<p>The United States remains committed to saving lives and ending the COVID-19 pandemic now. We look forward to the adoption of the G7+ action plan this weekend. We call on other countries and private sector partners to support this ambition.</p>

<p>Yesterday, as part of her ongoing engagement with stakeholders across the country, Deputy National Security Advisor for Cyber and Emerging Technology Anne Neuberger met with the bipartisan National Association of Attorneys General (NAAG) to speak to the cybersecurity challenges facing the nation, including the threat from ransomware. Neuberger stressed the important role state and local governments play in the nation’s cybersecurity, and emphasized the essential role attorneys general play in legal actions aimed at protecting state networks, ensuring consumer privacy, and prosecuting cybercrimes. She listened to the Attorneys General on the cyber challenges their states are facing, and briefed them on the measures that the public and private sector can immediately take to bolster cyber defenses.</p>



<p>Neuberger outlined the measures the Biden Administration has already taken to modernize cyber defenses, including the recent “Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity” Executive Order and the Administration’s ongoing efforts to partner with the public and private sectors to strengthen critical infrastructure cyber defenses. She spoke about the recent public-private Cybersecurity Industrial Control Systems Initiative and its pilot program to strengthen cyber resilience in the electric sector, noting the electric sector pilot will soon be followed by similar initiatives to strengthen the cyber resilience of other critical sectors like pipelines, water, and chemicals. Neuberger described the Biden Administration’s ransomware strategy which includes four lines of effort: disruption of ransomware infrastructure and actors by working closely with the private sector; international cooperation to hold countries who harbor ransom actors accountable; expanding cryptocurrency analysis to find and pursue criminal transactions; and reviewing the USG’s ransomware payment policies and approaches. She also underscored the President’s commitment to modernizing existing infrastructure while simultaneously investing in the infrastructure of the future.</p>



<p>In a reference to her <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Memo-What-We-Urge-You-To-Do-To-Protect-Against-The-Threat-of-Ransomware.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">open letter</a> to the private sector, Neuberger reiterated the need for private and public sector partnership to effectively guard against ransomware, recalling that much of U.S. critical infrastructure is owned and operated by the private sector. She reiterated her call to action that corporate leaders implement the discrete, high-impact cybersecurity measures contained in her open letter, and those referenced in the President’s Executive Order. Investing in cybersecurity is a far better investment for our economy and for companies than paying the funds in ransom.</p>

<p>President Biden’s American Rescue Plan included historic investments to support low- and middle-income parents – who have long faced increasing financial strain, worsened by the pandemic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, the Biden-Harris administration is announcing Child Tax Credit Awareness Day on Monday, June 21st to ensure parents know about the American Rescue Plan’s historic expansion of the Child Tax Credit and how it will benefit their families. Critically, as part of Child Tax Credit Awareness Day, the administration will encourage elected officials, organizations that fight for children, and faith-based organizations, to help low-income families—who may have such low-incomes that they are not required to file taxes—to use a new, easy Child Tax Credit sign-up tool to help give their children a lifeline out of poverty. And, the administration is releasing guidance for three elements of the American Rescue Plan that will support families, including: $15 billion for the <a href="https://www.acf.hhs.gov/occ/policy-guidance/ccdf-acf-im-2021-03">Child Care and Development Block Grant</a>, an historic expansion of the <a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/child-and-dependent-care-tax-credit-faqs">Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit</a>, and six months of extended support for small and midsize employers offering paid sick and family leave in response to the pandemic through the <a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/tax-credits-for-paid-leave-under-the-american-rescue-plan-act-of-2021-for-leave-after-march-31-2021">Paid Leave Tax Credit</a>.</p>



<p>These measures will help parents by helping them with the costs of raising children – measures that experts project could contribute to cutting child poverty in half. They will also help defray the costs of child care, provide more child care options, and support return to work for those who have lost their jobs or income &#8212; especially mothers. And, they will do all of this while investing in the future of the nation’s children.</p>



<p>While the American Rescue Plan is providing historic investments to confront the effects of the pandemic and help provide immediate relief from COVID-19, President Biden is calling to extend historic tax relief for working families and increase high quality child care and available paid family and medical leave through the American Families Plan and American Jobs plan.</p>



<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Families need support to power an equitable economic recovery and to support healthy development for children who most need it</span><br></strong><br>We are experiencing a record-setting economic recovery, with historic growth in employment and wages. And, in the first four months of the Biden administration, more than 2 million jobs were created—an average of 540,000 jobs a month. But, our economy remains about 7.6 million jobs below its pre-pandemic level, and labor force participation remains more than 1 percentage point below its pre-pandemic level. Women were also particularly hard hit by the pandemic. More than one-half of the lost jobs—nearly 4.2 million—were once held by women, and 1.8 million women remain out of the labor force.</p>



<p>And, the pandemic has exacerbated many families’ distress. According to the <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/poverty-and-inequality/tracking-the-covid-19-recessions-effects-on-food-housing-and#_ftnref8">latest U.S. Census Pulse survey in May,</a> one third of all adults with children are struggling to pay their usual expenses like food, rent, health care, and transportation. One in eight adults living with children report their household doesn’t have enough food to eat. One in five renters living with children reported that they are not caught up on rent. Black and brown families and women are disproportionately feeling the strain of the pandemic. And, financial hardship has <a href="/Users/KGLandrieu/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/Content.Outlook/FWH13A5H/•%09Extends%20the%20Child%20Tax%20Credit%20in%20the%20American%20Rescue%20Plan,%20which%20helps%20families%20raising%20children%20make%20ends%20meet">long-term consequences </a>for the healthy development of children.</p>



<p>Families need economic relief. And, many parents need support to be able to return to work or continue working so they can provide economic security for their families.</p>



<p>In part, lack of high-quality, affordable child care can make it logistically difficult for parents to work. Indeed, many parents—particularly mothers—<a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/early-childhood/reports/2019/03/28/467488/child-care-crisis-keeping-women-workforce/">report</a>&nbsp;that they work fewer hours than they would prefer or need to in order to care for their young children. For some parents there is no choice but to find outside care if they want or need to work: as found in a recent&nbsp;<a href="https://bfi.uchicago.edu/wp-content/uploads/BFI_WP_202046.pdf">analysis</a>, one in five workers live in households with a child under 14, but do not live with a non-working adult who could potentially serve as a caregiver. And, this problem is most acute for single mothers.</p>



<p>According to the latest U.S. Census Pulse Survey in May, about 7.6 million adults had someone in their household who took paid or unpaid leave, left their job, lost their job, or did not look for a job in the last month because child care arrangements remain disrupted due to the pandemic—three in four of whom were women and half of whom were women of color. Another 1.2 million women continued to work-from-home while they or another family member cares for their children. &nbsp;</p>



<p>And, the pandemic laid bare the fact that the majority of&nbsp; low-wage workers have <a href="https://www.bls.gov/ncs/ebs/benefits/2020/employee-benefits-in-the-united-states-march-2020.pdf">no access</a> to paid sick leave or paid family and medical leave. Ninety-five percent of low-wage workers have no access to paid family and medical leave and 69 percent have no access to paid sick leave. This meant workers were left with few options to protect their own and their families’ health and well-being at the beginning of COVID. Paid leave is a critical policy for ensuring workers stay connected to the jobs when a health need or crisis arises, and thereby, not lose needed income or a job.</p>



<p>The American Rescue Plan is taking several steps to support family economic security and the healthy development of children.</p>



<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Help is Here: Child Tax Credit Awareness Day</span><br></strong><br>The American Rescue Plan delivered major tax relief for working families with children through a historic expansion of the Child Tax Credit. In 2021, for most families, the Child Tax Credit is increased to $3,000 for each child between 6 and 17 years old and to $3,600 for each child under age 6. For example, a married couple making less than $150,000 with two children under age 6 will be eligible for a Child Tax Credit of $7,200 in 2021–at least $3,200 more than they would have received prior to the American Rescue Plan.</p>



<p>While tax relief is typically available only when you file your taxes, thanks to the American Rescue Plan, Child Tax Credit payments will be provided monthly for the first time ever, beginning in July. This means needed relief will reach families sooner, and they can count on it each month to help make ends meet. To help with the costs of raising children, families will begin to receive monthly payments of up to $250 for each child 6 to 17 years old and $300 for each child under age 6. Under the American Rescue Plan, the Child Tax Credit will be fully refundable, meaning that if a family’s income tax bill is less than the amount of their Child Tax Credit, they will get a payment for the difference. This will ensure for the first time that even the most hard-pressed families will get at least as much support as more affluent families.</p>



<p>The IRS estimates that roughly 39 million households — covering almost 90 percent of children in the United States — are slated to begin receiving monthly payments without any further action required. Other eligible families— those who have not yet filed taxes in 2019 or 2020 and who did not sign-up for Economic Impact Payments like the $1,400 rescue payments included in the American Rescue Plan—can still sign-up to receive monthly Child Tax Credit payments beginning this summer. Experts project that the expanded Child Tax Credit could potentially help lift one-half of all children out of poverty if all eligible families sign-up to receive the monthly payments.</p>



<p>Today, the Biden-Harris administration is announcing that Monday, June 21st will be Child Tax Credit Awareness Day—a day of action to get the word out far and wide on the upcoming monthly payments that will benefit nearly all families. It is also important that we extend these benefits beyond 2021 as the President has proposed in his American Families Plan. The administration will be calling on elected officials, faith-based groups, organizations that fight for children and families, and other partners to join us on June 21st to raise awareness that help is on the way.</p>



<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Child Care Development Block Grant Guidance</span><br></strong><br>The Biden Administration has provided states with unprecedented funding for expansions and improvements for child care, providing states with a tremendous opportunity to invest in early care and learning. The American Rescue Plan’s $39 billion investment in child care is historic on its own, and the administration has gone further to encourage state and local governments to finance quality child care options for parents and increase wages for the early childhood workforce. The Administration of Children and Families released <a href="https://www.acf.hhs.gov/occ/policy-guidance/ccdf-acf-im-2021-03">guidance </a>to States, Territories, and Tribes for the American Rescue Plan’s $15 billion in discretionary Child Care and Development Block Grants (CCDBG). The guidance strongly recommends that lead agencies focus resources on investing in child care in ways that strengthen the child care system and ensure that families have equal access to quality, affordable child care to support them during and after the pandemic. To do that, it:</p>



<ul><li>Strongly recommends that lead agencies prioritize increasing provider payment rates and workforce compensation so that child care providers can retain a skilled workforce and deliver higher-quality care to children receiving subsidies.<ul><li>While the economy has added <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CES6562440001">45,000</a> child care jobs since January, more than <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CES6562440001">one in eight </a>child care jobs have yet to return since the start of the pandemic. And, because of the lack of resources in the child care industry, annual turnover rates for child care workers were high even before the pandemic. The inability of providers to recruit and retain a high-quality workforce hinders access to care in many communities. And, for those who can access care, high turnover often disrupts the stable relationships between children and providers that are important to child development and wellbeing. The <a href="https://daneshyari.com/article/preview/353687.pdf">quality of the classroom environment</a> and interactions between teachers and students are linked to children’s school readiness skills, and <a href="https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED477480.pdf">higher compensation</a> for the child care workforce is associated with better quality literacy environments. But, <a href="https://cscce.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/ReportFINAL.pdf">nearly half</a> of child care workers – who are disproportionately women of color &#8212; rely on public income supports. Child care workers experiencing <a href="https://cscce.berkeley.edu/educator-work-environments-are-childrens-learning-environments-how-and-why-they-should-be-improved/">economic stress</a> have a more difficult time fully engaging with children and offering a quality learning experience.</li><li>Using these funds to increase payment rates to providers and workers’ compensation will improve care quality, give parents a wider range of options from which to choose, boost wages for a chronically underpaid workforce, and better support the small businesses that comprise the child care sector.</li><li>The guidance reminds lead agencies that the CCDBG Act requires that payment rates are sufficient to ensure equal access for eligible children to child care services that are comparable to those provided to children whose parents are not eligible to receive assistance, and it notes that many states will need to make progress to meet equal access requirements in the CCDBG Act.<br></li></ul></li><li>Recommends that, secondarily, lead agencies implement policies that will:<ul><li>Build the supply of child care in low-income communities, especially for historically underserved populations</li><li>Provide child care assistance to families who have lost employment or income during the pandemic</li></ul></li></ul>



<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit</span><br></strong><br>The American Rescue Plan’s historic expansion of the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit (CDCTC) will make child care more affordable for millions of working families in 2021. Today, the Internal Revenue Service released <a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/child-and-dependent-care-tax-credit-faqs">guidance</a> providing additional details on this critical assistance.</p>



<p>Reducing the&nbsp;cost&nbsp;of child care increases labor force participation among mothers of young children— which expands the workforce, provides additional income to parents, and grows the economy. A recent&nbsp;<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-016-9331-3">review</a>&nbsp;of research on child care costs and women’s labor supply finds that a 10 percent decrease in the cost of child care to families leads to a 0.5 to 2.5 percent increase in mother’s employment.</p>



<p>Thanks to the historic expansion of the CDCTC in the American Recovery Plan, child care is more affordable for families this year, helping parents work and supporting economic security of families. Specifically:</p>



<ul><li>A median income family with two kids under age 13 will receive up to $8,000 towards their child care expenses when they file taxes for 2021, compared with a maximum of $1,200 previously.</li><li>All families with incomes up to $125,000 will save up to one-half the cost of their eligible child care expenses, getting back up to $4,000 for one child and $8,000 for two or more children when they file taxes for 2021. By comparison, the same families in 2020 would have had only up to one-fifth of their eligible expenses covered, receiving no more than $600 for one child or $1,200 for two or more children. And, in 2021, families making between $125,000 and $400,000 can still receive a partial credit at least as generous as the credit they would have received in 2020.</li><li>And, for the first time, the CDCTC will be fully refundable, making the credit fairer by allowing low-income working families to receive the full value of the credit towards their eligible child care expenses regardless of how much they owe on their 2021 taxes.</li></ul>



<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Paid Leave Tax Credit</span><br></strong><br>Today, the Internal Revenue Service is also releasing <a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/tax-credits-for-paid-leave-under-the-american-rescue-plan-act-of-2021-for-leave-after-march-31-2021">guidance</a> for the American Rescue Plan’s paid leave tax credit. The advanceable, refundable tax credit offsets the cost for employers who voluntarily provide eligible employees paid sick or family leave, either for the employee&#8217;s own health needs or to care for family members.</p>



<p>Employers with fewer than 500 employees and certain government employers may receive up to $17,110 to provide employees with up to 10 days of paid sick leave and up to 12 weeks of paid family leave, from April 1 through September 30, 2021. Certain self-employed individuals in similar circumstances are entitled to similar credits. Roughly <a href="https://cdn.advocacy.sba.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/04144224/2020-Small-Business-Economic-Profile-US.">6 million businesses</a> and more than <a href="https://cdn.advocacy.sba.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/04144224/2020-Small-Business-Economic-Profile-US.">30 million workers</a> are eligible for this credit.</p>



<p>Tax credits can be claimed for employees who take time off because they are:</p>



<ul><li>exposed to COVID-19 or experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 and seeking a diagnosis, or caring for someone who has been exposed to COVID-19 or is experiencing COVID symptoms</li><li>caring for a child whose school or child care has been closed or unavailable due to COVID–19</li><li>getting a vaccine or recovering from it</li><li>subject to, or is caring for someone who is subject to, a COVID-19 quarantine or isolation order</li></ul>



<p>The Biden Administration strongly encourages employers to provide paid leave and take advantage of these credits. They can help ensure safe and healthy workplaces, while also ensuring that Americans can reenter or stay in the workforce as we continue to fight the virus and recover from the economic effects of COVID-19. Research has shown that states where employees gained access to paid sick leave through this tax credit experienced a <a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.2020.00863">slow-down in the spread of COVID</a>.</p>



<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Investing in Child Care and Paid Leave for the Long-Term</span><br></strong><br>Finally, President Biden is calling to permanently increase access to economic relief for families, high quality child care, and available paid family and medical leave. Even before the pandemic, a middle-class life – the ability to buy a home, afford child care, send a kid to college, save up to retire with dignity – was increasingly out of reach for families, and especially for women and people of color. While the American Rescue Plan is providing historic investments to confront the effects of the pandemic and help provide immediate relief from COVID-19, the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/28/fact-sheet-the-american-families-plan/">American Families Plan</a> and <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/03/31/fact-sheet-the-american-jobs-plan/">American Jobs Plan</a> will reimagine and rebuild a new, stronger economy that leaves no one behind. They will:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Extend the historic increase in the Child Tax Credit included in the American Rescue Plan</strong>, continuing major, monthly tax relief for families of up to $3,600 for each child to help parents meet the costs of raising children.</li><li><strong>Guarantee low- and middle-income families will spend no more than 7 percent of their income on high-quality child care for young children</strong>. The President’s Council of Economic Advisers estimates, based on a recent literature review, that this cost reduction could increase employment for parents that benefit by between four and 20 percent. High-quality child care also can provide lifetime benefits for children as they grow up healthier, do better in school, and earn more over the course of their lifetimes.</li><li><strong>Make permanent the American Rescue Plan’s expansion of the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit</strong>, so that families can continue to get back up to $8,000 of their child care expenses.</li><li><strong>Build the supply of child care</strong> including by building and upgrading facilities across the country.</li><li><strong>Invest in training and professional development of the child care workforce.</strong></li><li><strong>Establish a national comprehensive paid family and medical leave program</strong> that will bring America in line with competitor nations that offer paid leave programs. This new benefit, provided by the federal government, will ensure workers partial wage replacement to take time to bond with a new child; care for a seriously ill loved one; deal with a loved one&#8217;s military deployment; find safety from sexual assault, stalking, or domestic violence; heal from their own serious illness; or take time to deal with the death of a loved one. It will be available to workers regardless of employer size, sector, or type of employment.</li></ul>



<p>These investments will help build on the momentum of the American Rescue Plan to create a stronger, more equitable economy that supports families and strengthens the middle class.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>The Child Care Development Block Grant guidance released today will help states invest the $15 billion provided to them on </strong><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/15/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-american-rescue-plan-funding-to-rescue-the-child-care-industry-so-the-economy-can-recover/"><strong>April 15</strong></a><strong>.</strong> </span>The American Rescue Plan’s historic $39 billion investment in child care was provided to state, tribal, and territorial partners through two programs: (1) $24 billion for a new child care stabilization fund to help child care providers reopen or stay open, provide safe and healthy learning environments<strong>, </strong>keep workers on payroll, and provide mental health supports for educators and children, and (2) $15 billion in more flexible funding to help more low-income working families access high-quality care, increase compensation for early childhood workers, and help parents to work. A breakdown of funds received by State, Tribe and Territory is below.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>The United States is rallying the world’s democracies to deliver for our people, meet the world’s biggest challenges, and demonstrate our shared values</em></p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">Today, President Biden will meet with G7 leaders to discuss ways to forge a more fair, sustainable, and inclusive global economy that meets the unique challenges of our time. President Biden and G7 partners are committed to a global recovery that benefits the middle class and working families at home and around the world.</p>



<p>President Biden and G7 leaders agreed to continue providing policy support to the global economy for as long as necessary to create a strong, balanced, and inclusive economic recovery.&nbsp; In addition, leaders are expected to announce that the G7 is:</p>



<p><strong>Rallying around the US proposal for Strong Global Minimum Tax.  </strong>G7 leaders will endorse a strong global minimum tax of at least 15 percent. This U.S. priority is a critical step towards ending the decades-long race to the bottom that pushes nations to compete over who can offer the lowest tax rate to large corporations at the expense of protecting workers, investing in infrastructure, and growing the middle class.</p>



<p>This unprecedented progress reflects the Biden Administration’s commitment to building a global tax system that is equitable and equipped to meet the needs of the 21st century global economy. By making big multinational corporations pay their fair share and raising resources to fund priorities for domestic renewal – such as infrastructure, childcare, affordable housing, and education – a global corporate minimum tax is a key part of our efforts to deliver a foreign policy for the middle class, and will help support working families everywhere.&nbsp; This agreement is a clear illustration of how American leadership and commitment to multilateralism can produce results for American workers and businesses.<br><br>Today’s agreement paves the way for the removal of Digital Service Taxes (DSTs) and other discriminatory taxes. In addition to agreement on a global minimum tax, the G7 also reached historic agreement on a plan to replace DSTs with a broader reallocation of taxing rights to the places where the largest and most profitable multinational corporations are doing business and making money. Importantly, this applies to large multinationals broadly, both domestic and foreign, and not just the technology sector. This is an important principle for the United States, and will ensure that big multinational companies across the economy will pay a little more in the places where they operate, whether or not they have their headquarters there.<br><br><strong>Exploring a Major Reallocation of Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) to Countries in Need:&nbsp; </strong>The United States and our G7 partners are actively considering a global effort to multiply the impact of the International Monetary Fund’s proposed&nbsp; Special Drawing Rights (SDR) allocation to the countries most in need.&nbsp; At potentially up to $100 billion in size, the proposed effort would further support health needs &#8211; including vaccinations &#8211; and help enable greener, more robust economic recoveries in vulnerable countries, and promote a more balanced, sustained, and inclusive global recovery.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>More detail will be included in the G7 Leaders’ Communique.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>12:54 P.M. BST<br> <br>MODERATOR: And so, again, in the interest of time, we&#8217;re going to move on to this next section. <br> <br>I am now going to pass it back to [senior administration official], again, joined by [senior administration official], to preview the G7 Summit, as well as the economic deliverables to come out of that. <br> <br>A reminder that this section, unlike the other two, is embargoed until tomorrow morning, June 11th, 7:00 a.m. British Summer Time. <br> <br>So, [senior administration officials], we&#8217;ll pass it back to you.<br> <br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:   Thanks.  I&#8217;ll start and just point out, you know, this is the first G7 Summit in nearly two years.  It&#8217;s the first G7 Summit that President Biden is attending.  It is the first G7 Summit that has been held since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.  And we think it is an incredibly important moment for the G7 for all the reasons I was just describing. <br> <br>As the President has said many times, we are entering a period in which the question has been called between democracies and autocracies.  And pulling together the G7, plus our partner countries, we believe would demonstrate that we&#8217;re unified in our resolve to show that democracy and shared democratic values provide the single best path for delivering results for our people and for meeting the biggest challenges of the world. <br> <br>And I want to just reinforce that last point.  Top to bottom, the driving, animating purpose of this G7 Summit is to show that democracies can deliver against the biggest challenges we are facing in the world. <br> <br>So, on the global economy, the G7 will be spending its time here talking about how it can most effectively contribute to the global economic recovery and to global economic fairness, including through things like committing to this global minimum tax.<br> <br>On COVID-19, as we&#8217;ve already talked about, not only will there be a significant commitment of doses, but an embrace of a broader roadmap to help end the pandemic.<br> <br>On climate, we will have more to say over the next couple of days, but the G7 countries will not only recommit to what they&#8217;ve laid out at the President&#8217;s Leaders Summit on Climate, as well as their own national contributions, but there will be tangible action proposed and adopted at this G7, on climate. <br> <br>And then, in terms of infrastructure and the enormous need for low- and middle-income countries around the world to have their infrastructure requirements met, the G7+ will embrace a high-standards, transparent, climate-friendly, non-corrupt mechanism for investing in the physical, digital, and health infrastructure of low- and middle-income countries.  It will be an alternative to that which other countries, including China, are offering. <br> <br>And then, of course, there will be discussion of all of the hotspots and the key regional challenges, as well as the way in which new technologies are reshaping our world.  So they will discuss ransomware and how to set the rules of the road on all forms of emerging technology so that it’s democracies, and not autocracies, who are laying the foundation for standards as we go forward.<br> <br>All of this will end up getting enshrined in the G7 leaders communiqué that will be released at the conclusion of the summit.  There will be a few other leader-level documents as well, but that&#8217;s the broad basis of what we&#8217;re trying to accomplish: meaningful outcomes on COVID, on climate, on the global economy, on infrastructure, on ransomware, and cyber. <br> <br>And when you add it all up, I think a fair read of what will come out of these next few days is one of the most substantive, if not the most substantive, set of deliverables out of the G7 in long memory.  It&#8217;s &#8212; there&#8217;s going to be a lot packed into these three days and a number of significant, concrete outcomes.<br> <br>So, with that, let me turn it over to [senior administration official].<br> <br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yeah, thanks, [senior administration official].  So I&#8217;ll talk about the first working session of the G7, which is going to be tomorrow.  And it&#8217;s going to focus on the global economy. <br> <br>So, let me give some context, which is that the U.S. is once again leading the world economy into recovery from a position of strength at home. <br> <br>And as you know, this is a dramatic turnaround from when the President took office four months ago.  U.S. economic growth projections for this year have doubled since December; they&#8217;re projected to be the fastest in almost 40 years. <br> <br>The labor market is clearly gathering strength.  The economy has added over 540,000 jobs on average since the President took office, the most over four months of any presidency. <br> <br>Unemployment has fallen from above 14 percent to under 6 percent, and it&#8217;s expected to return to pre-pandemic levels by 2023, which is about seven years faster than compared to the post-2009 recovery.  Actually, if you look at the latest jobs report, it showed the largest one-month drop in long-term unemployment in a decade. <br> <br>And for context, long-term unemployment is especially pernicious to the labor force.  The longer one is unemployed, the more difficult, historically, it&#8217;s been to find new employment. <br> <br>So, you know, that&#8217;s the context.  And importantly, as we head into these G7 meetings, the strength of the U.S. economy is helping to power the global economic recovery.  Both the OECD and the IMF estimate that U.S. economic growth this year will add a percentage point to global growth.  And this is coming after 2020 &#8212; a year in which global growth contracted 3.5 percent, which is the worst peacetime recession since the Great Depression. <br> <br>So these economic outcomes, as [senior administration officials] both alluded to, they&#8217;re the result of deliberate choices: the wartime, whole-of-government effort that [senior administration official] described to beat back the pandemic, but also the bold and unflinching decision the President made to go big and upfront on fiscal support and the plans to make generational investments to address structural challenges and lift the economy&#8217;s growth potential by addressing longstanding disparities and by boosting the innovation and dynamism of the economy. <br> <br>So, here at the G7, we&#8217;ll continue to make efforts to accelerate the global growth recovery, which, in turn, will create long-term benefits to U.S. exports and U.S. jobs. <br> <br>So we&#8217;ll do that in three ways.  We&#8217;ll &#8212; leaders will encourage G7 partners to continue providing near-term fiscal support to create a balanced global recovery, as well as long-term structural investments to boost our innovation and dynamism together. <br> <br>We will also build on the commitment from finance ministers, last week, to give active consideration to channel a proportion of the IMF&#8217;s plans to allocate $650 billion in economic support through Special Drawing Rights to multiply the impact of that allocation to lower-income countries where the pandemic response needs are the greatest and where the economic recovery has been slowest. <br> <br>And the last thing I&#8217;ll mention before we can take questions is: Leaders will also endorse the historic agreement reached last week by finance ministers for a global minimum corporate tax of at least 15 percent.  It&#8217;s a major statement to have G7 unity on this effort.  It will serve as a springboard to getting broader agreement at the G20.  So we see this as a critical step towards ending the race to the bottom on corporate taxes that&#8217;s come at the expense of workers, at the expense of investments in domestic renewal, and at the expense of growing the middle class.<br> <br>I&#8217;ll stop there.<br> <br>MODERATOR:  Thanks so much.  So, we have time for a couple of questions.  So, if you&#8217;ve got a question on this recent G7 section or the economic deliverables, please use the “raise hand” function.<br> <br>Okay, no questions.  As a reminder that this most recent section &#8212; oh, coming in at the last second.  Well, why don&#8217;t we start with Andrew Restuccia with the Wall Street Journal.<br> <br>Q    Thanks.  I wanted to ask [senior administration official] about the Johnson meeting just because we only got one question on that.  Can you talk a little bit about Northern Ireland specifically and what the President might tell the Prime Minister on that subject?  And I would love for you to respond to this report in the Times of the UK, as well, if you could.  Thanks.<br> <br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  All right, sure.  On Northern Ireland, the President is going to say to the Prime Minister what he has said publicly for a long time now, including as recently as St. Patrick&#8217;s Day, which is that he believes that the Good Friday Agreement is the foundation for peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland; that a lot of progress has been made over the 20-plus years since the Good Friday Agreement came into force and that that progress must be protected; and that the outcome of the current discussions between the UK and the EU should ensure the continued vitality of the Good Friday Agreement.<br> <br>You know, the United States is not in those negotiations and not seeking to be in those negotiations.  And we are instead a strong and vigorous supporter of practical, creative, flexible, results-oriented negotiations that, at the end of the day, produce a result that protects all of the gains that the people of Northern Ireland &#8212; that all communities in Northern Ireland have made.  And that&#8217;s what he&#8217;s going to say.<br> <br>It will not be confrontational or adversarial or &#8212; you know, he didn&#8217;t come here to give a lecture.  He came merely to communicate what he believes very, very deeply about peace in Northern Ireland, about the priority the United States places on that, about the priority Joe Biden places on that.  And that&#8217;s the spirit with which he&#8217;ll approach the conversation.<br> <br>MODERATOR:  Thank you.  And so, in the interest of time, we&#8217;re going to have to conclude.  Thanks so much for everyone joining.<br> <br>As a friendly reminder, again, this most recent section on the G7 preview and economic deliverables is embargoed until tomorrow, June 11th, 7:00 a.m. British Summer Time.  And the other two sections on the COVID-19 vaccine announcement, as well as the preview of the President&#8217;s bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Johnson are embargoed until this call concludes, which will be momentarily.<br> <br>Thank you again for all your time.  And we&#8217;ll be in touch very soon.<br> <br>12:57 P.M. BST</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Tregenna Castle Resort<br>Cornwall, United Kingdom</p>



<p>6:28 P.M. BST<br><br>PRESIDENT BIDEN:&nbsp; Good evening, everyone.&nbsp; First, I want to express our condolences on behalf of Jill and I to Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II, the entire Royal Family, and the people of the United Kingdom.&nbsp; Today would have been Prince Philip’s 100th birthday, and I know there are a lot of people feeling his absence today.&nbsp;<br><br>In addition, I&#8217;d like to point out that the &#8212; the greet from the British government has been exemplary.&nbsp; We’ve had a good first full day here in the UK.&nbsp; Prime Minister Johnson and I had a very productive meeting.&nbsp; We discharged and discussed a broad range of issues on which the United Kingdom and the United States are working in very close cooperation.<br><br>We affirmed the Special Relationship &#8212; and it&#8217;s not said lightly &#8212; the Special Relationship between our people, and we renewed our commitment to defending the enduring democratic values that both our nations share &#8212; (clears throat) &#8212; that are the strong &#8212; excuse me &#8212; the strong foundation of our partnership.<br><br>Eighty years ago, Prime Minister Winston Churchill and President Franklin Roosevelt signed an agreement known as the Atlantic Charter.&nbsp; It was a statement of first principles &#8212; a promise that the United Kingdom and the United States would meet the challenges of their age and they would meet it together.<br><br>Today, we’ve built on that commitment with a revitalized Atlantic Charter updated to reaffirm that promise while speaking directly to the key challenges of this century: cybersecurity, emerging technologies, global health, and climate change.<br><br>We discussed our common goals for driving ambitious global action to address the climate crisis.&nbsp; The Climate Leaders Summit that I hosted in April was, in part, about helping drive forward the momentum toward the critical COP 26 that the UK will host in Glasgow later this year.<br><br>We talked about the shared sacrifices our service members have made, bravely serving side by side in Afghanistan for close to 20 years.&nbsp; The UK was with us from the start, as they always are, equally committed to rooting out the terrorist threat, and now we&#8217;re coordinating our withdrawal together.<br><br>And, of course, we talked about how our two nations can, together, lead the global fight against COVID-19.&nbsp; That’s been a major focus of the G7 under British leadership, particularly in focusing and coordinating our resources to help vaccinate the world.<br><br>And tonight, I&#8217;m making a historic announcement regarding America’s leadership in the fight against COVID-19.&nbsp; America knows firsthand the tragedies of this pandemic.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve had &#8212; we&#8217;ve had more people die in the United States than anywhere in the world: nearly 600,000 of our fellow Americans &#8212; moms, dads, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters, grandparents.&nbsp; More deaths from COVID-19 in the United States than from World War One, World War Two, the Vietnam War, and 9/11 combined &#8212; combined.&nbsp; We know the tragedy.<br><br>But we also know the path to recovery.&nbsp; The United States has now vaccinated 64 percent of our adults with at least one shot.&nbsp; Just four and half months ago, we were at only 5 percent with one shot.<br><br>It took a herculean effort on the part of our government to manage one of the biggest and, I would say, most complicated logistical challenges in our history.&nbsp; It took the ingenuity of scientists, building on decades of research, to develop a vaccine.&nbsp; It took the full capacity of American companies manufacturing and delivering the vaccines around the clock.<br><br>And as a result, we have the lowest number of daily deaths since the first day of this pandemic.&nbsp; Our economy is rebounding.&nbsp; Our vaccination program has already saved tens of thousands of lives, with that count growing each day.&nbsp; And it has allowed millions &#8212; millions of Americans to get back to living their lives.<br><br>And from the beginning of my presidency, we have been clear-eyed that we need to attack this virus globally as well.&nbsp; This is about our responsibility &#8212; our humanitarian obligation to save as many lives as we can &#8212; and our responsibility to our values.<br><br>We value the inherent dignity of all people.&nbsp; In times of trouble, Americans reach out to offer help and to offer a helping hand.&nbsp; That’s who we are.<br><br>And when we see people hurting and suffering anywhere around the world, we seek to help as best we can.&nbsp; That’s why,&nbsp;under both Republican and Democratic Presidents, the United States has made transformative commitments to bolster global health &#8212; commitments under President Bush, like PEPFAR, which changed the global fight against HIV/AIDS.&nbsp; And in this moment, our values call on us to do everything that we can to vaccinate the world against COVID-19.<br><br>It&#8217;s also in America’s self-interest.&nbsp; As long as the virus rages elsewhere, there is a risk of new mutations that could threaten our people.&nbsp;<br><br>We know that raging COVID-19 in other countries holds back global growth, raises instability, and weakens governments.&nbsp; And as we’ve seen in the United States, with the evidence clearer day by the day, the key to reopening and growing economies is to vaccinate your people.&nbsp;<br><br>Our vaccination program has helped the American economy begin to recover from the worst economic crisis in a century.&nbsp; Over 2 million new jobs created just in the last four months since I&#8217;ve become President.&nbsp; A historic decline in long-term unemployment.&nbsp; Businesses reopening and a projected economic growth of nine point &#8212; excuse me, 6.9 percent &#8212; the fastest in nearly four decades in America.<br><br>Just as the American economy is recovering, it is in all of our interests to have the global economy begin to recover as well.&nbsp; And that won’t happen unless we can get the pandemic under control worldwide.<br><br>That&#8217;s why, as I said in my address to the joint session of Congress in April, America will be the arsenal of vaccines in our fight against COVID- &#8212; COVID-19, just as America was the arsenal of democracy during World War Two.<br><br>Over the past four months, we have taken a number of steps toward this historic effort.&nbsp; We have contributed more than any nation to COVAX &#8212; a collective global effort that is delivering COVID-19 vaccines across the world.<br><br>We have supported manufacturing efforts abroad through our partnerships with Japan, India, and Australia &#8212; known as the &#8220;Quad.&#8221;&nbsp; We&#8217;ve shared doses with our neighbors Canada and Mexico.<br><br>And in addition, three weeks ago, with America’s vaccines &#8212; America&#8217;s vaccine supply secured and with confidence we have enough vaccines to cover every American who wants one, we announced that we would donate 80 million doses of our own vaccine &#8212; in house now &#8212; to supply the world by the end of June.&nbsp; Many of these doses are shipping to countries around the world as we speak.<br><br>And today, we&#8217;re taking a major step that will supercharge the global fight against this pandemic.&nbsp; At my direction, the United States will purchase an additional half billion doses from Pfizer &#8212; the Pfizer vaccine &#8212; that we&#8217;ll donate nearly 100 low- and lower-middle-income countries.&nbsp;&nbsp; They will be the beneficiaries.&nbsp;<br><br>Let me say that again: The United States will purchase a half a billion doses of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine to donate to nearly 100 nations that are in dire need in the fight against this pandemic.&nbsp; That&#8217;s a historic step.&nbsp; The largest single purchase and donation of COVID-19 vaccines by any single country ever.<br><br>Importantly, this is an mRNA vaccine, which is proven to be extremely effective against COVID-19 and every known variant of that virus thus far.<br><br>These half a billion vaccines will start to be shipped in August as quickly as they roll off the manufacturing line.&nbsp; Two hundred million of these doses will be delivered this year, in 2021, and 300 million more will be delivered in the first half of 2022.<br><br>Let me be clear: Just as with the 80 million doses&nbsp;we previously announced, the United States is providing these half million [billion] doses with no strings attached.&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me say it again: with no strings attached.<br><br>Our vaccine donations don’t include pressure for favors or potential conce- &#8212; concessions.&nbsp; We’re doing this to save lives, to end this pandemic.&nbsp; That&#8217;s it.&nbsp; Period.&nbsp;<br><br>I also want thank Albert Bourla, Pfizer’s CEO and Chairman, for joining me today.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve gotten to know each other over the last few months.&nbsp; He and I and his entire team have really &#8212; he&#8217;s really stepped up at this critical stage in our fight against the pandemic.<br><br>And the plan is for a half a billion doses that we&#8217;ll be sending around the world to be produced in the United States,<br>including at Pfizer’s manufacturing plant in Kalamazoo, Michigan.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Eighty years ago, not too far from that plant in Kalamazoo in the Detroit area, American workers built tanks and planes and vehicles that helped defeat the global threat of fascism in World War Two.&nbsp; They built what became known as the “arsenal of democracy.”<br><br>Now, a new generation of American men and women, working with the day&#8217;s &#8212; working with today’s latest technology, is going to build a new arsenal to defeat the current enemy of world peace, health, and stability: COVID-19.&nbsp;<br><br>Albert was gracious enough to welcome me to Kalamazoo plant back in February.&nbsp; It’s incredible the ingenuity, the care, the safety that goes into every single dose as I toured the entire plant.&nbsp;<br><br>Most of all, when you&#8217;re there, you feel the pride every worker there feels, how &#8212; the pride they feel in what they are doing.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve been to a lot of plants.&nbsp; I have worked &#8212; I&#8217;m a big union guy.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve been doing it my whole career.&nbsp; But you could see the looks on their faces; they were proud.&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean it sincerely, they were proud of what they were doing.&nbsp; They knew what they were doing.&nbsp;<br><br>American workers will now produce vaccines to save lives of people in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean.&nbsp; People they will never meet and have never met in places they&#8217;ve never visited and probably won&#8217;t have an opportunity to, but lives saved all the same thanks to American leadership and American workers&#8217; hard work and values.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Let me close with this: This is a monumental commitment by the American people.&nbsp; As I said, we&#8217;re a nation full of people who step up at times of need to help our fellow human beings, both at home and abroad.&nbsp; We&#8217;re not perfect, but we step up.&nbsp;<br><br>But we&#8217;re not alone in this endeavor, that&#8217;s the point I want to make.&nbsp; We&#8217;re going to help lead the world out of this pandemic, working alongside our global partners.<br><br>Under the UK chairmanship of the G7, democracies of the world are posed to deliver as well.&nbsp; This U.S. contribution<br>is the foundation for additional coordinated efforts to help vaccine the world &#8212; vaccinate the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>The British government, the Prime Minister has led a strong campaign to get people vaccinated across the UK, and I’m grateful they&#8217;re making their own generous donation.<br><br>Tomorrow, the G7 nations will be announcing the full scope of our commitment &#8212; &#8220;our,&#8221; meaning the G7.&nbsp; And I want to thank all of my G7 partners for stepping up to recognize our responsibility to meet the moment.&nbsp; I’m looking forward to working with my counterparts on these efforts in the coming days and much more.<br><br>One final point I want to make clear: This is not the end of our efforts to fight COVID-19 or vaccinate the world.&nbsp; We have to turn manufacturing &#8212; we have to turn manufactured doses into shots in arms to protect people and communities.<br><br>That’s why the United States is already providing hundreds of millions in funding to support last-minute vaccination efforts, including new funding from Congress as part of the American Rescue Plan and working with programs in Latin America, Asia, and Africa.<br><br>We’re going to keep manufacturing doses, donating doses, getting “jabs” &#8212; as they say here in the UK &#8212; in arms, until the world has beaten this virus.&nbsp;<br><br>I want to thank you all.&nbsp; Now, I&#8217;d like to turn it over to my friend, the CEO and Chairman of Pfizer, Aver- &#8212; Al- &#8212; Albert Bourla. &nbsp;<br><br>Albert, it&#8217;s all yours.&nbsp; And, again, personally, thank you for stepping up.&nbsp;<br><br>MR.

<p>Today, the President of the United States and Prime Minister of the United Kingdom reaffirm their commitment to work together to realise our vision for a more peaceful and prosperous future.<br><br>Our revitalised Atlantic Charter, building on the commitments and aspirations set out eighty years ago, affirms our ongoing commitment to sustaining our enduring values and defending them against new and old challenges.&nbsp;We commit to working closely with all partners who share our democratic values and to countering the efforts of those who seek to undermine our alliances and institutions.<br><br><strong>First</strong>, we resolve to defend the principles, values, and institutions of democracy and open societies, which drive our own national strength and our alliances.&nbsp;We must ensure that democracies – starting with our own –&nbsp;can deliver on solving the critical challenges of our time.&nbsp;We will champion transparency, uphold the rule of law, and support civil society and independent media.&nbsp;We will also confront injustice and inequality and defend the inherent dignity and human rights of all individuals.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Second</strong>, we intend to strengthen the institutions, laws, and norms that sustain international co-operation to adapt them to meet the new challenges of the 21<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;century, and guard against those that would undermine them.&nbsp;We will work through the rules-based international order to tackle global challenges together;&nbsp;embrace the promise and manage the peril of emerging technologies; promote economic advancement and the dignity of work; and enable open and fair trade between nations.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Third</strong>, we remain united behind the principles of sovereignty, territorial integrity, and the peaceful resolution of disputes. We oppose interference through disinformation or other malign influences, including in elections, and reaffirm our commitment to debt transparency, sustainability and sound governance of debt relief.&nbsp;So too will we defend key principles such as freedom of navigation and overflight and other internationally lawful uses of the seas.<br><br><strong>Fourth,&nbsp;</strong>we resolve to harness and protect our innovative edge in science and technology to support our shared security and deliver jobs at home; to open new markets; to promote the development and deployment of new standards and technologies to support democratic values; to continue to invest in research into the biggest challenges facing the world; and to foster sustainable global development.<br><br><strong>Fifth,</strong>&nbsp;we affirm our shared responsibility for maintaining our collective security and international stability and resilience against the full spectrum of modern threats, including cyber threats.&nbsp;We have declared our nuclear deterrents to the defence of NATO and as long as there are nuclear weapons, NATO will remain a nuclear alliance. Our NATO Allies and partners will always be able to count on us, even as they continue to strengthen their own national forces. We pledge to promote the framework of responsible State behaviour in cyberspace, arms control, disarmament, and proliferation prevention measures to reduce the risks of international conflict.&nbsp;We remain committed to countering terrorists who threaten our citizens and interests.</p>



<p><strong>Sixth,</strong>&nbsp;we commit to continue building an inclusive, fair, climate-friendly, sustainable, rules-based global economy for the 21<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;century. We will strengthen financial stability and transparency, fight corruption and illicit finance, and innovate and compete through high labour and environmental standards.</p>



<p><strong>Seventh</strong>, the world has reached a critical point where it must act urgently and ambitiously to tackle the climate crisis, protect biodiversity, and sustain nature. Our countries will prioritise these issues in all our international action.<br><br><strong>Eighth</strong>, we recognise the catastrophic impact of health crises, and the global good in strengthening our collective defences against health threats. We commit to continuing to collaborate to strengthen health systems and advance our health protections, and to assist others to do the same.<br><br><strong>Joseph R. Biden, Jr.</strong><br><strong>Boris Johnson, M.P.</strong><br>June 10, 2021</p>
