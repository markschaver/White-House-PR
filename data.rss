										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>Thank you, Christine. It’s not easy having to change schools, especially in high school. But with running and student council, you’ve become a true leader here. I know you’ve got a bright future ahead.</p>



<p>Thank you, Leslie, for welcoming us to Knob Noster—and I also want to thank Stephany for showing us around Whiteman Elementary earlier today. I loved hearing from your students!</p>



<p>When we landed this morning, we were greeted by the incredible leadership of Whiteman Air Force Base. And with us is one of our great civilian leaders—Secretary Cardona.</p>



<p>Miguel, you remind us that serving our military-connected students isn’t just the responsibility of our military. It takes all of our government coming together to honor their service and sacrifice.</p>



<p>And it takes all of our communities, as well. That’s why I’m so grateful for students like Tony who strengthen this school for all students, military and civilian alike.</p>



<p>Good afternoon, Panthers! I’m so excited to be here—and to see all of this school spirit! And I’m especially excited to celebrate Month of the Military Child with you.</p>



<p>Now, I know not all of you know me very well, so I want to tell you a little bit about myself. I, too, come from a military family.</p>



<p>My dad served in the Navy during World War II—though that was long before I was born. And my son Beau, was a Major in the Delaware Army National Guard.</p>



<p>Just one day after my husband Joe’s first Vice Presidential debate in 2008, Beau deployed to Iraq.</p>



<p>As you can guess, it was a pretty incredible time for the entire family. We were flying to different cities in one day, going to rallies and giving interviews.</p>



<p>Then—we won.</p>



<p>When we got the news, it was one of the best moments of our lives. And all we wanted to do was share it with Beau.</p>



<p>So when we went out to the victory rally, we video-called his unit from a laptop. They were all together, eating pizza, and as soon as I saw his smiling face, it was like something in my heart clicked back into place.</p>



<p>We carried the laptop on stage with us and showed him the crowd of a million cheering people. It wasn’t as good as having him there, but it meant the world to me just the same.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Life doesn’t stop just because someone you love needs to be halfway around the world. Or because your parent gets the call to move to a new town. You find ways to make it work.</p>



<p>But it’s hard sometimes. I saw it with Beau’s children, Natalie and little Hunter.</p>



<p>Like many of your families, we all did our best to make up for his absence, with big birthday parties and extra attention. But we couldn’t fill that empty chair at dinner time. No one could but their daddy.</p>



<p>I once asked Natalie what she would tell a child like herself, whose mom or dad was going to be deployed, and she said, “Nana, I wouldn’t tell her anything because I wouldn’t want her to be sad.”</p>



<p>So, I understand a little of what military families go through. You face unique challenges—and your stories don’t always get told.</p>



<p>That’s why I’m here today—to shine a light on what it means to be a military kid.</p>



<p>More than 10 years ago, I helped launch <em>Joining Forces</em>—a White House initiative to support military and veteran families like some of yours. And since then, I’ve heard your stories.</p>



<p>I’ve heard what it’s like to work so hard to become captain of your sports team or the lead in your school play, only to realize that your next school doesn’t have the program you love.</p>



<p>I’ve heard about what it’s like to stay up late, worrying about the safety of someone you love most in the world. Or what it’s like to leave behind best friends and wonder if you’ll be able to keep in touch.</p>



<p>Our non-military connected students know what that’s like too. It affects your whole community, right? &nbsp;</p>



<p>But I’ve also heard about the great parts of this journey: The chance to see different parts of our country—or meet people from around the world.</p>



<p>The friendships that are close enough to span the many miles between you—that take more work than walking next door, but are worth it, just the same.</p>



<p>How you learn to adapt to any situation and realize that you’re capable of more than you thought.</p>



<p>This life is unlike any other. You face different challenges from most kids your age—challenges that the adults in your life can’t shield you from, no matter how hard we try.</p>



<p>Parents, I know there have been moments when you’ve asked yourself if you made the right choice for your child during your service.</p>



<p>But I hope you see how the path you’ve chosen has made these students the incredible people they have become—people who are ready for whatever the world has in store for them. Isn’t that what all parents want for our children?</p>



<p>The lives of military students may not be defined by the edges of a hometown. Your school journey may look different than the ones we see in movies. But that’s what makes you unique.</p>



<p>The lessons you’ve learned have made you strong, wise, kind, and courageous.</p>



<p>The experiences you’ve had are the gifts that you have to give.</p>



<p>You have so much to teach us all.</p>



<p>And that’s why we have to tell your stories.</p>



<p>Our world is your hometown, and as you serve and represent our nation, you are shaping it, every day.</p>



<p>God bless our troops and their families.</p>

<p>I just spoke with President Zelenskyy and shared with him that my Administration is authorizing an additional $800 million in weapons, ammunition, and other security assistance to Ukraine. The Ukrainian military has used the weapons we are providing to devastating effect. As Russia prepares to intensify its attack in the Donbas region, the United States will continue to provide Ukraine with the capabilities to defend itself.<br> <br>This new package of assistance will contain many of the highly effective weapons systems we have already provided and new capabilities tailored to the wider assault we expect Russia to launch in eastern Ukraine. These new capabilities include artillery systems, artillery rounds, and armored personnel carriers. I have also approved the transfer of additional helicopters. In addition, we continue to facilitate the transfer of significant capabilities from our Allies and partners around the world. <br> <br>The steady supply of weapons the United States and its Allies and partners have provided to Ukraine has been critical in sustaining its fight against the Russian invasion. It has helped ensure that Putin failed in his initial war aims to conquer and control Ukraine. We cannot rest now. As I assured President Zelenskyy, the American people will continue to stand with the brave Ukrainian people in their fight for freedom.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Vice President Harris to Host First-Ever Meeting with Cabinet Officials on Maternal Health</em></p>



<p>On Wednesday, April 13, 2022, during Black Maternal Health Week, Vice President Kamala Harris will convene a meeting with Cabinet Secretaries and agency leaders to discuss the Administration’s whole-of-government approach to addressing maternal mortality and morbidity. The Vice President will convene leaders across the federal government – including agencies that may not have historically taken a leading role addressing the maternal health crisis.<br>&nbsp;<br>In December 2021, Vice President Harris convened the first-ever federal Maternal Health Day of Action, where she announced a historic Call to Action to improve health outcomes for parents and infants in the United States. This resulted in the Administration’s announcement of <a href="https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&amp;id=bdad8be2d8&amp;e=60572324a0">private sector</a> and <a href="https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&amp;id=dd8d87202c&amp;e=60572324a0">public sector</a> investments. Ahead of the meeting with Cabinet officials, the Administration is following up with additional actions to address maternal health, and to combat the systemic inequities that lead to worse maternal outcomes for Black, Native American, and rural women.<br>&nbsp;<br><strong><u>New Announcements:</u></strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>11 Additional States and D.C. Ask to Extend Medicaid and CHIP Coverage to a Full Year After Pregnancy under American Rescue Plan: </strong>The American Rescue Plan is working to make Medicaid and CHIP coverage for 12 months after pregnancy a reality for people across the country.&nbsp;The Vice President called on states to expand their postpartum coverage during her Call to Action in December.<ul><li>The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) has approved Louisiana, Virginia, New Jersey, and Illinois’ extension of Medicaid and CHIP coverage for 12 months after pregnancy on or before April 1, 2022. CMS is also working with another eleven states and the District of Columbia to extend postpartum coverage for a full year after pregnancy, including: California, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Oregon, New Mexico, South Carolina, Tennessee, and West Virginia.&nbsp; In addition, a number of other states have announced that they are working to extend Medicaid and CHIP coverage to 12 months after pregnancy, and CMS looks forward to working with those states.</li><li>In order to receive federal funds and to ensure consistency with federal standards, including those set by the American Rescue Plan, states must go through a formal process run by CMS. Medicaid covers more than 40 percent of births in the United States, and extending this coverage will bring the peace of mind of health coverage to parents and children during the vulnerable post-partum period.&nbsp;</li><li>Based on HHS estimates, approximately 720,000 people would benefit if all states were to adopt the American Rescue Plan’s new option to extend post-partum Medicaid and CHIP coverage for a full 12 months.</li></ul></li><li><strong>“Birthing-Friendly” Hospital Designation: </strong>CMS is proposing the “Birthing-Friendly” hospital designation to drive improvements in maternal health outcomes and maternal health equity. The “Birthing-Friendly” hospital designation would assist consumers in choosing hospitals that have demonstrated a commitment to maternal health. The Administration announced this new designation during the White House Maternal Health Day of Action Summit.<ul><li>Initially, the designation would be awarded to hospitals based on attestation that the hospital has participated in maternity care quality improvement collaboratives and implemented best practices that advance health care quality, safety, and equity for pregnant and post-partum patients.</li><li>Data will be submitted by hospitals for the first time in May 2022, and CMS will post data for October to December 2021 in fall 2022. Criteria for the designation may be expanded in the future.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Engaging the Health Care Industry to Improve Health Outcomes: </strong>In Summer 2022, CMS will convene health care industry stakeholders – including health care facilities, insurance companies, state officials and providers – to focus on industry commitments to improve health outcomes experienced by pregnant and postpartum people. CMS and experts will share best practices and commitments and request that health care industry leaders make commitments to advance maternal health.</li><li><strong>Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting (MIECHV) Programs:</strong> The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), through the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), announced approximately $16 million to strengthen Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting (MIECHV) Programs through seven awards supporting eight states.<ul><li>These awards will advance data and technology innovations to support positive maternal and child health outcomes in states and communities, and focus on addressing health disparities.</li></ul></li><li><strong>State Maternal Health Innovation and Implementation (State MHI) Program:</strong> State MHI supports state-level development and implementation of proven strategies to improve maternal health and address maternal health disparities. The new funding, $9 million, will continue to build state capacity to deliver high-quality maternity care services and provide training for maternal care clinicians. It also adds a component to enhance the quality of state-level maternal health data through better collection, reporting and analysis.&nbsp;The program will fund up to nine cooperative agreements, and each will receive up to $1 million over five years.</li><li><strong>Maternal Health Best Practices: </strong>HHS, through the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), is also, on telehealth.hhs.gov, posting a new Maternal Health Best Practice Guide for providers to incorporate telehealth for prenatal and postpartum care, and monitoring within high-risk pregnancy. Through remote patient monitoring, screening and treatment for postpartum depression, and lactation consulting, maternal telehealth can help reduce barriers to access to critical care for mothers before, during and after a pregnancy.</li></ul>



<p><strong><u>Previous Actions Announced since the Vice President’s Call to Action in December</u></strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>Investing in Doulas:</strong> HHS <a href="https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&amp;id=4a82af5246&amp;e=60572324a0">announced</a> the availability of $4.5 million for hiring, training, certifying, and compensating community-based doulas in areas with high rates of adverse maternal and infant health outcomes, doubling the number of Healthy Start doula programs nationwide.</li><li><strong>Title X</strong>: HHS <a href="https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&amp;id=014e3bb105&amp;e=60572324a0">restored</a> access to Title X family planning services nationwide to fill service gaps caused by more than a quarter of Title X providers withdrawing from the program over the past two and a half years in response to the previous administration’s Title X rule. HHS awarded $256.6 million in grant funding to support 76 grantees to deliver equitable, affordable, client-centered, and high-quality family planning services.</li><li><strong>FY23 Budget Request</strong>: The President’s budget includes $470  million to: reduce maternal mortality and morbidity rates; expand maternal health initiatives in rural communities; implement implicit bias training for healthcare providers; create pregnancy medical home demonstration projects; and address the highest rates of perinatal health disparities, including by supporting the perinatal health workforce.</li></ul>



<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Additional Background</span></strong></p>



<ul><li>As Vice President, Kamala Harris has worked closely with President Biden and other leaders in the Administration to improve outcomes for Black women and their families.<ul><li>The White House released a Presidential Proclamation to mark Black Maternal Health Week in <a href="https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&amp;id=1dc908d34d&amp;e=60572324a0">2021</a> and <a href="https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&amp;id=ce11247eb4&amp;e=60572324a0">2022</a>.</li><li>In December 2021, the Vice President led a <a href="https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&amp;id=eb284fc1e0&amp;e=60572324a0">Maternal Health Day of Action Summit</a>, noting the urgent need to address this crisis.<ul><li>At the Summit, the Vice President <a href="https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&amp;id=9726cc666b&amp;e=60572324a0">announced</a> guidance to help states provide 12 months of continuous postpartum coverage through their Medicaid programs, up from 60 days; a new HHS report showing the impact of state extensions of Medicaid postpartum coverage to 12 months; and CMS’s plan to propose the establishment of a “Birthing-Friendly” hospital designation.

<p>Dear Madam Speaker: (Dear Madam President:)</p>



<p>Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1662(d)) provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, within 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President publishes in the <em>Federal Register </em>and transmits to the Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the anniversary date. &nbsp;In accordance with this provision, I have sent to the <em>Federal Register</em> for publication the enclosed notice stating that the national emergency with respect to specified harmful foreign activities of the Government of the Russian Federation declared in Executive Order 14024 of April 15, 2021, which was expanded in scope in Executive Order 14066 of March 8, 2022, and with respect to which additional steps were taken in Executive Order 14039 of August 20, 2021, Executive Order 14068 of March 11, 2022, and Executive Order 14071 of April 6, 2022, is to continue in effect beyond April 15, 2022.</p>



<p>Specified harmful foreign activities of the Government of the Russian Federation &#8212; in particular, efforts to undermine the conduct of free and fair democratic elections and democratic institutions in the United States and its allies and partners; to engage in and facilitate malicious cyber-enabled activities against the United States and its allies and partners; to foster and use transnational corruption to influence foreign governments; to pursue extraterritorial activities targeting dissidents or journalists; to undermine security in countries and regions important to United States national security; and to violate well-established principles of international law, including respect for the territorial integrity of states &#8212; continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United&nbsp;States. &nbsp;Therefore, I have determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency declared in Executive Order 14024 with respect to specified harmful foreign activities of the Government of the Russian Federation.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-right">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sincerely,</p>



<p class="has-text-align-right">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.</p>

<p>On April 15, 2021, by Executive Order 14024, I declared a national emergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States constituted by specified harmful foreign activities of the Government of the Russian Federation. &nbsp;On March 8, 2022, I issued Executive Order 14066 to expand the scope of the national emergency declared in Executive Order 14024. &nbsp;On August 20, 2021, March 11, 2022, and April 6, 2022, I issued Executive Orders 14039, 14068, and 14071, respectively, to take additional steps with respect to the national emergency declared in Executive Order 14024.</p>



<p>Specified harmful foreign activities of the Government of the Russian Federation &#8212; in particular, efforts to undermine the conduct of free and fair democratic elections and democratic institutions in the United States and its allies and partners; to engage in and facilitate malicious cyber-enabled activities against the United States and its allies and partners; to foster and use transnational corruption to influence foreign governments; to pursue extraterritorial activities targeting dissidents or journalists; to undermine security in countries and regions important to United States national security; and to violate well-established principles of international law, including respect for the territorial integrity of states &#8212; continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United&nbsp;States. &nbsp;For this reason, the national emergency declared in Executive Order 14024, which was expanded in scope by Executive Order 14066, and with respect to which additional steps were taken in Executive Orders 14039, 14068, and 14071, must continue in effect beyond April 15, 2022.</p>



<p>Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency declared in Executive Order&nbsp;14024.</p>



<p>This notice shall be published in the <em>Federal Register</em> and transmitted to the Congress.</p>

<p>Governor Abbott’s unnecessary and redundant inspections of trucks transiting ports of entry between Texas and Mexico are causing significant disruptions to the food and automobile supply chains, delaying manufacturing, impacting jobs, and raising prices for families in Texas and across the country. Local businesses and trade associations are calling on Governor Abbott to reverse this decision because trucks are facing lengthy delays exceeding 5 hours at some border crossings and commercial traffic has dropped by as much as 60 percent.  The continuous flow of legitimate trade and travel and CBP’s ability to do its job should not be obstructed. Governor Abbott’s actions are impacting people’s jobs, and the livelihoods of hardworking American families. </p>
