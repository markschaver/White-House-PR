										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>Yesterday, in response to the Supreme Court’s ruling in <em>West Virginia v. EPA</em>, President Biden issued a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/06/30/statement-by-president-joe-biden-on-supreme-court-ruling-on-west-virginia-v-epa/">statement</a> on his unwavering commitment to “continue using lawful executive authority, including the EPA’s legally-upheld authorities, to keep our air clean, protect public health, and tackle the climate crisis” and “tackle environmental injustice, create good-paying jobs, and lower costs for families building the clean energy economy.”<br><br>Vice President Harris <a href="https://twitter.com/VP/status/1542631060789293058">emphasized</a> that while “the Supreme Court’s misguided ruling aims to take our country backward,” through “executive authority, legislation, and state and local action, we must charge forward.” National Climate Advisor Gina McCarthy <a href="https://twitter.com/ginamccarthy46">stressed</a> that even though the Supreme Court is “siding with extreme special interests that want to dismantle our right to clean air,” President Biden will “keep moving us forward, using every tool we can to tackle the climate crisis,” and EPA Administrator Michael Regan <a href="https://twitter.com/EPAMichaelRegan/status/1542656005644902401">made clear</a> that the agency “will move forward using our Clean Air Act authority, consistent with the law, to set greenhouse gas standards for power plants.”<br><br><em>Read more about how the Biden-Harris Administration is pressing ahead:</em><br><br><strong>Time: </strong><a href="https://time.com/6192857/biden-climate-scotus-west-virginia/">&#8216;We Have to Be Creative.&#8217; How the Biden Administration Is Responding to the SCOTUS Climate Setback</a><br>[Justin Worland, 6/30/22]<br><br>Gina McCarthy, President Joe Biden’s national climate advisor . . . was surprisingly optimistic—not that the ruling would go the Administration’s way, but rather that the White House could chart a path to slash emissions even if it didn’t. <strong>“We’ve set very solid goals, we’re making significant progress on the transition to clean energy,” she told TIME on June 28. “And that is not going to live and die by the Supreme Court’s decision.”</strong> To meet the White House’s goals, she said, the Administration needs to get “creative” and find novel ways to galvanize the energy transition. That includes . . . the Administration’s engagement with the private sector, use of its own purchasing power, and use of the Defense Production Act to accelerate the production of domestic clean energy technology, she says.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>PBS NewsHour:</strong><a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/amp/show/epa-administrator-michael-regan-discusses-supreme-court-ruling-on-climate-change">EPA Administrator Michael Regan discusses Supreme Court ruling on climate change</a><br>[Interview, 6/30/22]</p>



<p>EPA Administrator Michael Regan: “Let me be clear. It doesn&#8217;t take us out of the game. <strong>We still will be able to regulate climate pollution. And we&#8217;re going to use all of the tools in our toolbox to do so </strong>. . . One tool that we will continue to look at is the authority that was in question with the Supreme Court. Again, that tool is still available. We have just lost some flexibility there . . . But it does not prevent us from continuing to make progress. And so we will have to be vigilant in terms of focusing on climate change pollution . . . We&#8217;re going to use every tool in the toolbox that we have to set and implement environmental standards that meet our obligation to protect all people and all communities from environmental harm.”<br><br><strong>Gina McCarthy on CNN:</strong><a href="https://twitter.com/TheLeadCNN/status/1542642048016293889">The Lead with Jake Tapper</a><br>[Interview, 6/30/22]</p>



<p>National Climate Advisor Gina McCarthy: “We are not giving up, we’re actually going to double down.

<p>National Climate Advisor Gina McCarthy: “The Court hasn’t tied our hands on climate change . . . <strong>it was a very disappointing decision, but it did not strip away the ability for EPA to regulate greenhouse gases</strong> . . . and more broadly, people should understand that this President didn’t come into office thinking that EPA was the sole way in which we could move forward on climate change . . . He recognized that special interests for decades have been funded by fossil fuel companies to really wage a long-term campaign to strip away all these environmental protections that keep our water and our air clean . . . but that’s why the President said we’re not just going to rely on EPA, we’re going to have a whole-of-government approach . . . we’re leaving no stone unturned . . . to invest in a clean energy future.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Richmond, VA</p>



<p>We’re here in Richmond because the President and I—and the entire Administration—care about this community. We care about your families and we want to make sure that everyone has the information they need to stay safe. So, I want to speak to the moms and dads for just a moment. </p>



<p>You know, when you become a parent, there’s a moment that we all go through: You look at that baby, with eyes like saucers and the tiniest fingers. And you feel an overwhelming sense of love, deep in your bones, and absolute terror.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because you know that this fragile life is depending on you. And from that moment on, you see dangers that you never even noticed before.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, we buy baby gates and cover our electrical outlets. We wrestle them into car seats no matter how much they complain. We make them eat their vegetables and slather them in sunscreen while they fight us with the strength of a linebacker! And after bedtime, when we’re exhausted from the day, we carefully close their bedroom door and feel a pang of gratitude.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because in that rare quiet, we know that everything is OK. That they are healthy and growing—that we are OK.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Parents, we do absolutely everything to protect our kids. And in this pandemic, you did.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many of you had to go through birth without your own parents there to help you recover. You had to quarantine with your newborn and without the friends and neighbors who could come over and give you a few hours to yourself. You wrestled tiny masks onto children who couldn’t understand them; you weighed the risk of going to crowded areas or traveling to see loved ones.</p>



<p>And you waited. You waited to feel the same relief you saw in families of older children. &nbsp;</p>



<p>I know it’s been hard. But you’ve done an amazing job. You’ve protected your baby and carried your family through this.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And now, that relief is finally here: a vaccine for our youngest children.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s been thoroughly reviewed and rigorously tested. It’s safe and effective. It’s free. And it’s available for every child in this country, as young as six months old. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, even though so many parents have been waiting for this day, I know you may have questions. So talk to your pediatrician. Get the answers that you need.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And if you decide that this vaccine is right for your child, go to vaccines.gov to find a vaccine site near you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Parents, this is your choice—and we want you to have all of the information you need to make it.</p>



<p>Parenthood and worrying go hand-in-hand. And I can’t promise you that the dangers of the world are going to become any less frightening—just wait until your kids start driving!&nbsp;</p>



<p>But with this vaccine, we can take away at least one of those worries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From the day your sweet, fragile, little baby was born, you have made the choice, again and again, to keep your child safe. This is your choice too. So, make the decision to protect your children with the same vaccine that has already saved millions of lives. Because nothing is more important than our children’s health.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s up to us to keep them safe—and with this vaccine, we can.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thank you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Biden Administration will facilitate air shipment of approximately 6.2 million 8-ounce bottle equivalents of Reckitt Mead Johnson Enfamil Stage 1 infant formula base powder July 12, 14, and 19</em></p>



<p><br>Today, President Biden is announcing that his Administration is sourcing a flight, facilitated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), for Operation Fly Formula to transport Reckitt Mead Johnson infant formula base powder from Singapore to Chicago, Illinois via flights on July 12, 14, and 19.This delivery will include over 418,000 pounds of Reckitt Mead Johnson Enfamil Stage 1 infant formula base, the equivalent of approximately 6.2 million 8-ounce bottles. Upon its arrival, this powder will be transferred to a Wanamingo, MN facility for conversion to final product that will be made available in the coming weeks. The product will be available at national and regional retailers.  </p>



<p>In May, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced that the agency is exercising enforcement discretion so that Reckitt Mead Johnson can export additional infant formula into the U.S.&nbsp;By mid-July, Reckitt Mead Johnson plans to bring approximately 66 million 8-ounce bottle equivalents of Enfamil Stage 1 infant formula base powder into the U.S. market.</p>



<p>President Biden launched Operation Fly Formula to speed up the import of infant formula and start getting more formula to stores as soon as possible. Under Operation Fly Formula, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the General Services Administration (GSA), and the Department of Defense (DOD) are partnering to pick up overseas infant formula that meets U.S. health and safety standards, so it can get to store shelves faster. By July 3, Operation Fly Formula will have transported more than 37.2 million 8-ounce bottle equivalents to the U.S.</p>



<p>In addition, the Biden Administration has taken a number of other important actions to ensure there is enough safe infant formula for families, including invoking the Defense Production Act, entering into a consent agreement between the FDA and Abbott Nutrition to reopen the company’s Sturgis facility, and issuing FDA guidance so that major formula manufacturers can safely import formula that is not currently being produced for the U.S. market. Details of our actions can be found at whitehouse.gov/formula.</p>

<p>Today, President Biden convened nine Democratic Governors from across the country to discuss efforts to defend reproductive rights. These Governors collectively represent tens of millions of women. They are each taking action to protect access to abortion care, including by: announcing funding for reproductive health care services; educating the public; supporting the codification of the right to access an abortion into state law and state constitutions; issuing executive actions to defend patients, including out-of-state patients, providers, and third parties; and even taking action <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2022/06/24/west-coast-states-launch-new-multi-state-commitment-to-reproductive-freedom-standing-united-on-protecting-abortion-access/">together</a> to support abortion access. These steps by Democratic Governors are critical as states enact and enforce laws to ban abortion and criminalize their citizens in the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision in <em>Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, </em>which overturned <em>Roe v. Wade</em>.</p>

<p>Today, some of Florida’s most vulnerable students and families are more fearful and less free. As the state’s shameful “Don’t Say Gay” law takes effect, state officials who claim to champion liberty are limiting the freedom of their fellow Americans simply to be themselves. Already, there have been reports that “Safe Space” stickers are being taken down from classrooms. Teachers are being instructed not to wear rainbow clothing. LGBTQI+ teachers are being told to take down family photos of their husbands and wives—cherished family photos like the ones on my own desk.<br> <br>This is not an issue of “parents’ rights.” This is discrimination, plain and simple. It’s part of a disturbing and dangerous nationwide trend of right-wing politicians cynically targeting LGBTQI+ students, educators, and individuals to score political points. It encourages bullying and threatens students’ mental health, physical safety, and well-being. It censors dedicated teachers and educators who want to do the right thing and support their students. And it must stop.<br> <br>President Biden has been very clear that every student deserves to feel safe and welcome in the classroom. The Department of Education will be monitoring this law, and any student or parent who believes they are experiencing discrimination is encouraged to file a complaint with the Department’s Office for Civil Rights. Our Administration will continue to fight for dignity and opportunity for every student and family—in Florida and around the country.</p>
