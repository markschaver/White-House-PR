<p class="has-text-align-center">South Court Auditorium</p>



<p>1:41 P.M. EDT</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT: Good afternoon. Today, the Vice President and I would like to lay out our plan for June, to counter &#8212; continue, I should say, our successful fight against the pandemic as we approach the July 4th date.<br><br>In just four months, thanks to the American people, we have made incredible progress getting people vaccinated quickly, efficiently, and equitably. Nearly 170 million Americans of every party, every background, every walk of life have stepped up, rolled up their sleeves, and gotten the shot.<br><br>Fifty-two percent of adults are now fully vaccinated, including seventy-five percent of all seniors. Twenty-eight states and the District of Columbia have achieved 50 percent of adults being fully vaccinated in their jurisdictions.<br><br>And it’s clearer than ever: The more people we get vaccinated, the more success we’re going to have in our fight against this virus.<br><br>Since January 20 &#8212; and we’re talking, now, about <s>15</s> [5] months &#8212; the average daily cases are down from 184,000 to 19,000, below 20,000 for the first time since March of 2020. Average hospitalizations are down from 117,000 to 21,000. Death rates are down over 85 percent.<br><br>And this didn’t just happen by chance. We got to this moment because we took aggressive action from day one with a whole-of-government response. We used every lever at our disposal to get this done.<br><br>We experienced the production and expanded it in a significant way: in lifesaving vaccines available for every single American. They’re available, and we knew that was the case months ago.<br><br>We worked with cities and states to create over 80,000 vaccination sites. We deployed over 9,000 federal staff, including 5,100 active-duty troops to help get shots in arms. Now, as a result, we have built a world-class vaccination program.<br><br>I promised you we’d marshal a wartime effort to defeat this virus, and that’s just what we’ve been doing.<br><br>And now, tens of millions of Americans have been vaccinated. They’re able to return to closer to a &#8212; closer-to-normal life.<br><br>Fully vaccinated people are safely <s>shredding</s> [shedding] their masks and greeting one another with a smile. Grandparents are hugging their grandkids again. Small-business owners are reopening storefronts and restaurants.<br><br>Because of the vaccination strategy, our economic strategy, we’re &#8212; experienced the strongest economic recovery this country has seen in decades.<br><br>There is a group called the Organization of Economic Co-operation and Development &#8212; OECD &#8212; which includes most of the world’s largest economies in its membership. They’ve been one of those leading bodies analyzing economic growth across &#8212; around the world for 60 years.<br><br>Just this week, they increased their projection for the U.S. economic growth this year to 6.9 percent &#8212; 6.9 percent. That’s the fastest pace in nearly four decades. And that’s because of our vaccination program and our economic response, which, alone, are adding 3 to 4 percentage points to our growth; driving stronger growth not just there &#8212; not just this year, but in years to come.<br><br>In fact, America is the only major country where global forecasters have actually increased their five-year forecasts for economic growth since January of 2020.<br><br>And because of that, America is headed into the summer dramatically different from last year’s summer: a summer of freedom, a summer of joy, a summer of get-togethers and celebrations. An all-American summer that this country deserves after a long, long, dark winter that we’ve all endured.<br><br>But what happens after the summer? The data could not be clearer: For all the progress we’re making as a country, if you are unvaccinated, you are still at risk of getting seriously ill or dying, or spreading disease to others, especially when Americans spend more time indoors again, closely gathered in the fall, as &#8212; and as we face the potential threat of a new, more dangerous variants.&nbsp;<br><br>Even now, if you look at the areas of the country where vaccination rates are the highest, the death &#8212; the death rates are dramatically falling. They &#8212; the vaccines are effective; they’re effective against the variants currently circulating in the United States. On the other hand, COVID deaths are unchanged in many parts of our country that are lagging behind in vaccinations.<br><br>And for young people who may think this doesn’t affect you, listen up, please: This virus, even a mild case, can be with you for months. It will impact on your social life. It could have long-term implications for your health that we don’t even know about yet or fully understand yet.<br><br>It’s true that young people are much less likely to die from COVID. But if you do not get vaccinated, you could get COVID sooner or later. But you could get COVID still.<br><br>A substantial percentage of people with COVID, even young people, will suffer illnesses, and some will have long-term health impacts as a consequence.<br><br>If you’re thinking that the side effects from the shot are worse than the COVID, or that you can’t just take a chance, you are just dead wrong.<br><br>Do it for yourself. Do it to protect those more vulnerable than you: your friends, you family, your community.<br><br>You know, some people have questions about how quickly the vaccines were developed. They say they’ve been developed so quickly, they can’t be that good. Well, here’s what you need to know: Vaccines were developed over a decade of research in similar viruses, and they’ve gone through strict FDA clinical trials.<br><br>The bottom line is this &#8212; I promise you: They are safe. They are safe. And even more importantly, they’re extremely effective.<br><br>And if you’re vaccinated, you are protected. If you are not vaccinated, you are not protected.<br><br>Places with high vaccination rates will also see fewer cases of COVID moving forward. Places with lower vaccination rates are going to see more.<br><br>You know, we were elected to be President and Vice President for all Americans. And I don’t want to see the country that is already too divided become divided in a new way &#8212; between places where people live free from fear of COVID and places where, when the fall arrives, death and severe illnesses return.<br><br>The vaccine is free, it’s safe, and it’s effective. Getting the vaccine is not a partisan act. The science was done under Democratic and Republican administrations. Matter of fact, the first vaccines were authorized under a Republican President and widely developed by a Democratic President &#8212; deployed by a Democratic President.<br><br>All over the world, people are desperate to get a shot that every American can get at their neighborhood drug store at no cost, with no wait.<br><br>Every American over 12 years of age &#8212; no matter where you live, what you believe, who you voted for &#8212; has the right to get vaccinated. It’s your choice.<br><br>So, please, exercise your freedom, live without fear. We need to be one America, united &#8212; free from fear this fall.<br><br>Now, how will we keep beating this virus as we enter &#8212; as we enter the fall after summer? On May 4, I asked Americans to come together to get 70 percent of adults with one shot by July 4th &#8212; 70 percent at least with one shot. To date, 12 states have already reached this important milestone. We expect &#8212; we expect more to make this milestone this week.<br><br>Nationally, we are at 63 percent of adults with one shot. And we are getting closer, but we still have work to do. With 73 percent of Americans over the age of 40 with one shot, and as &#8212; we especially need people under 40 to step up. Over 40 is doing much better.<br><br>That’s why, today, we’re announcing a month-long effort to pull all the stops &#8212; all the stops to free ourselves from this virus and get to 70 percent of adult Americans vaccinated.<br><br>Now, I’m going to take everyone &#8212; you know, it’s going to take everyone &#8212; everyone &#8212; the federal government; the state governments; local, Tribal, and territorial governments; the private sector; and, most importantly, the American people &#8212; to get to the 70 percent mark so we can declare our independence from COVID-19 and free ourselves from the grip it has held over us &#8212; our lives for the better part of a year.<br><br>Each of you has the power to help us gain this freedom as a nation. If you get a shot this week, you can be fully vaccinated by July 4th &#8212; by the week of July the 4th. And you can celebrate Independence Day free from fear or worry.<br><br>This effort has five key parts. First, we’re making it easier than ever to get vaccinated. Ninety percent of you live within five miles of a vaccination site. The vaccinations are free, and most places allow walk-up vaccinations. No appointment needed.<br><br>You can go to Vaccines.gov or text your ZIP Code to 438829 to get a text back with the places you can get a shot that are close by.<br><br>And now, we’re going to make it even easier. In response to our call to action, businesses and organizations across the country have stepped up to help everyone get vaccinated.<br><br>Starting next week, many vaccination sites will be offering extended hours during the month of June, including pharmacies that will be open 24 hours every Friday night &#8212; for 24 hours they’ll be open &#8212; this month.<br><br>And if you’re too busy at work or school, you can get vaccinated around the clock on any Friday. Any Friday.<br><br>For parents who haven’t been able to get the shot because they didn’t have the childcare: Starting today, KinderCare, Learning Care Group, the Bright Horizons, alongside with hundreds of YMC- loc- &#8212; YMCA locations, are going to offer free drop-in childcare while the parents are getting vaccinated.<br><br>In addition, Uber and Lyft are both offering free rides to and from vaccination sites &#8212; vaccination centers. It&#8217;s easier than ever to get vaccinated.<br><br>So, again, text 438829 to vi- &#8212; to find out what the nearest places you can get vaccinated are from where you &#8212; from where your ZIP Code. And visit pharmacies with an extended-hour and walk-up shots that are available. Free childcare, free rides, free shots.<br><br>Second, we&#8217;re going to <s>reduce</s> [redouble] our outreach and public education efforts. We&#8217;re going to relaunch them, in effect. We&#8217;re going to launch a national vaccination tour to encourage people to take the shot. The Vice President is going to lead that tour across the South and the Midwest, where we still had millions of people to vaccinate.<br><br>She&#8217;s going to be joined by Jill &#8212; by the First Lady and the Second Gentleman and Cabinet Secretaries along the way.<br><br>In the spirit of meeting people where they are, we&#8217;ll also be working with the Black Coalition Against COVID and other organizations to launch a new initiative called &#8220;Shots at the Shop.&#8221; Barbershops, beauty shops are hubs of activity and information in Black and brown communities in particular, but in many communities across the nation. Local barbers, stylists, they become key advocates for vaccinations in their communities, offering information to customers, booking appointments for them, even using their own businesses as vaccination sites. We&#8217;re going to work with shops across the country to make an even bigger impact over the next month.<br><br>We&#8217;ll also kick things off this weekend with a National Canvassing Weekend, where thousands of volunteers will be out knocking on doors and encourage their communities to get vaccinated.<br><br>And mayors &#8212; mayors will be stepping up even more over the next month and partnering with us on the City Vaccination Challenge to see which city can grow its vaccination rate the fastest &#8212; the most &#8212; by July 4th.<br><br>We need you to join these efforts. This is the kind of on-the-ground work that’s going to get the job done.<br><br>Third, we&#8217;ll be increasing our work with employers &#8212; employers. A lot of working people are holding back because they&#8217;re concerned about losing pay if they take time off to get a shot, or if they don&#8217;t feel well the next day. I&#8217;ve said before: For small- and medium-sized employers, if you give people paid time off to get a shot, you&#8217;ll get a tax credit to cover that cost.<br><br>Already, millions of workers across the country are eligible for paid time off and incentives from their employers. I&#8217;m asking all employers: Do the right thing.<br><br>And we&#8217;re making it easy for employers to set up on-the-job vaccination clinics to make it even more convenient for their employees to get a shot.<br><br>Fourth, we&#8217;re going to continue encouraging people to get vaccinated with incentives and fun rewards. The state of Ohio had a heck of a fun reward &#8212; a new millionaire last week &#8212; thanks to the creative idea of the governor for holding a vaccination &#8212; a vaccine lottery.<br><br>The grocery store, Kroger, announced that they&#8217;re going to give away $1 million each week to someone who gets vaccinated at one of their pharmacies.<br><br>The NBA, the NHL, NASCAR &#8212; NASCAR tracks &#8212; they&#8217;re offering vaccine- &#8212; vaccines outside playoff games and at races. Major League Baseball will be offering free tickets to people who get vaccinated at the ballpark.<br><br>And to top it off, Anheuser-Busch announced that beer is on them on July the 4th. That&#8217;s right, get a shot and have a beer. Free beer for everyone 21 years or over to celebrate the independence from the virus.<br><br>Fifth, and finally, we&#8217;re asking the American people to help. We need you. We need you to get your friends, family, neighbors, and coworkers vaccinated. Help them find an appointment. Drive them to the site. Talk to them about why you made the choice for yourself. So many Americans have already stepped up to help get their communities vaccinated.<br><br>And over the next month, we&#8217;re going to need you more than ever. We need every American to commit to the five actions I&#8217;ve mentioned this month.<br><br>Go to WeCanDoThis.HHS.gov &#8212; WeCanDoThis.HHS.gov &#8212; to sign up to volunteer and learn more about how you can help.<br><br>Take at least five actions to help in June. And you might even be invited to visit us at the White House in July to celebrate independence together.<br><br>I&#8217;ll close with this: We need everyone across the country to pull together to get us over the finish line. I promise you we can do this. Just look at what we&#8217;ve already done &#8212; we&#8217;ve already accomplished together in only four months.<br><br>We know it for a fact: Americans could do anything when we do it together. So, please, do your part. Give it your all through July the 4th. Let&#8217;s reach our 70 percent goal. Let&#8217;s go into the summer freer and safer. Let&#8217;s celebrate a truly historic Independence Day.<br><br>Thank you for listening. Please get engaged. May God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you.<br><br>Q&nbsp; Mr. President, will you retaliate against Russia for this latest ransomware attack?<br><br>THE PRESIDENT: We&#8217;re looking closely at that issue.<br><br>Q&nbsp; Do you think Putin is testing you?<br><br>THE PRESIDENT: No.<br><br>1:58 P.M. EDT</p>

PSAKI:  Hi, everyone.  Happy Wednesday.  Don&#8217;t be distracted by Andrew&#8217;s fabulous seersucker suit over here.  (Laughter.)<br><br>Okay, a couple of items for all of you at the top.  The President is running a little bit late too, so we&#8217;ll have a hard out at about five or ten after, but we&#8217;ll keep you honest, for those of you who are joining his event.<br><br>Today, the Biden-Harris administration launched the Low-Income Household Water Assistance Program, a first-of-its-kind water assistance program that will expand access to more affordable water, and help low-income households affected by the COVID-19 pandemic pay their water and wastewater bills, avoid shutoffs, and support household water system reconnections related to non-payment.  $166.6 million, or 15 percent of allocated program funding, is being made immediately available to grantees, which will then, of course, be distributed in communities.<br><br>In total, $1.1 billion will be available through grants, including $500 million in American Rescue Plan funding.<br><br>The President believes that having access to affordable, clean, and safe drinking water is essential to everybody’s health and wellbeing. <br><br>A little preview of the President’s remarks for later this afternoon: We have now vaccinated 63 percent of<s> the country</s> [adults], and over 72 percent of those 40 and older are vaccinated thanks to aggressive action by this administration.  COVID-19 cases and deaths have plummeted as a result.  Cases are down over 90 percent.  Deaths are down over 85 percent since January 20th.  The fact remains: If you are not vaccinated, you are at risk of getting the virus or spreading it to someone else.<br><br>So, today, the President will announce the launch of a month of action to mobilize an all-of-America sprint to get more people vaccinated by July 4th.  Community leaders, faith partners, businesses, celebrities, athletes, colleges, and thousands of volunteers will participate in this nationwide campaign. <br><br>And as part of the month of action, we’re making it even easier to get vaccinated, which, as we&#8217;ve seen, is the key to increasing numbers and getting more shots in arms. <br><br>So the nation’s largest childcare providers will watching &#8212; will be watching kids for free while parents get the shot.  Vaccines will happen at barber shops, baseball games, and NASCAR races.  Pharmacies will be open 24 hours on Fridays.<br><br>And throughout our time in office, we’ve seen &#8212; we&#8217;ve led a whole-of-government effort to get the vaccine out.  So this next month, we’re continuing to build on that by leading canvassing, phone banking, texting into areas with low vaccination rates; coordinating vaccine events.  More than 100 organizations have committed to hosting over a thousand events the first weekend alone.  And we&#8217;re also launching a National Vaccination Tour.  The Vice President will lead a tour to key communities across the South and Midwest.  That will be coming up. <br><br>And we&#8217;re launching a Mayors Challenge &#8212; and you&#8217;ve seen a little bit of activity about this already &#8212; where cities compete to boost vaccination rates through canvassing, local partnerships, and incentives for people. <br><br>And through the COVID-19 College Challenge, more than 230 colleges and universities are taking pledge &#8212; taking pledge and commit &#8212; taking a pledge and committing to taking action to get their students and communities vaccinated.<br><br>And finally, businesses like Anheuser-Busch, Kroger, and DoorDash are stepping up to offer all adults free beer on July 4th, the chance to win a million dollars, and free meals for people who get vaccinated at community health centers. <br><br>We&#8217;ve seen Krispy Kreme has done this.  I would not recommend a Krispy Kreme with a beer, but I&#8217;ll leave that to other people to decide. <br><br>Finally, the President wants to convey his heartfelt congratulations to Congresswoman-elect Melanie Stansbury on her decisive victory last night, marking the first time in over 100 years that a special election has been won by a larger margin than their party received in the previous general election.  He looks forward to working with her in Congress.  <br><br>Alex, why don&#8217;t you kick us off. <br><br>Q    Sure.  I have a couple of questions.  First, on JBS, can you confirm that a ransom demand came from REvil?  I know it&#8217;s a criminal organization likely based in Russia.  And was the ransom paid? <br><br>And then, can you speak a little bit about &#8212; have you seen any progress on this call from the government for business and private sector to work with the federal government in updating their cybersecurity measures?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  On the last part, I&#8217;m not in a place to confirm the specifics of the ransom request or the origin.  Obviously, our team is continuing to evaluate.  And I would send you to the company for any specific questions about the ransom request. <br><br>I will say that this attack is a reminder about the importance to private sector entities of hardening their cybersecurity and ensuring that they take the necessary steps to prepare for this threat, which we&#8217;ve seen rising even over the last few weeks.<br><br>As it relates to actions we&#8217;re taking in the federal government, the President has launched a rapid strategic review to address the increased threat of ransomware, to include four major lines of effort:<br><br>Disruption of ransomware infrastructure and actors.  Working closely with the private sector &#8212; we will work in partnership with them.  That is something that this administration has done a bit differently than in the past in working to find best practices, ensuring that private sector entities have a seat at the table, and we can work in close coordination.<br><br>Building an international coalition to hold countries who harbor ransom actors accountable.  I mean, this attack is an example of how this is not just a problem in the United States.  These are actors that are working to get into systems around the world.  This was a company obviously based in Brazil, but Australia was a major &#8212; was impacted also by this. <br><br>Expanding cryptocurrency analysis &#8212; obviously, this has been an increasing question out there &#8212; to find and pursue criminal transactions.<br><br>And reviewing our own ransomware policies. <br><br>So this is an internal policy process &#8212; essentially, one that&#8217;s looking at all of these entities within our national security/economic team.<br><br>Q    And then, on the President&#8217;s comments yesterday, he seemed to call out Manchin and Sinema for &#8212; he said, voting &#8220;more with…Republicans&#8221; than Democrats.  But ProPublica actually found that they&#8217;ve so far voted with Biden 100 percent of time on major votes.  And so can you explain where those comments came from and why he felt the need to call out members of his own party?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Well, I would say, first, that if Senator Manchin and Senator Sinema were standing with me here today &#8212; they&#8217;re always welcome &#8212; they would call out their own independent streaks, and that&#8217;s something that I think they&#8217;re both proud of.  They both vote for and represent the people in the states that &#8212; and all the people who elected them to represent them in the Senate. <br><br>If you look at what the Senate &#8212; the President said &#8212; the big tell here is, &#8220;I hear all the folks on TV saying.&#8221;  Now, as a former TV pundit myself, I can tell you that sometimes these conversations can be oversimplified.  TV isn&#8217;t always made for complex conversations about policymaking.  We all know that.  Right? <br><br>And what the President was simply conveying is that he &#8212; his threshold, his litmus test is not to see eye to eye on every single detail of every issue &#8212; and he doesn&#8217;t with Senator Sinema and Senator Manchin, and he doesn&#8217;t with Senator Capito, who&#8217;s coming here later this afternoon.  He believes there&#8217;s an opportunity to work together, to make progress, to find areas of common ground even if you have areas of disagreement. <br><br>And he also believes that sometimes, because there are three entities &#8212; three branches of government &#8212; something he knows well, having served 36 years in the Senate &#8212; that sometimes it&#8217;s not a straight line to victory or success; that sometimes, you know, it takes more time and, you know, he is open to many paths forward.<br><br>So I don&#8217;t think he was intending to convey other &#8212; anything other than a little bit of commentary on TV punditry.<br><br>Q    Well, he did seem to suggest that he is in favor of filibuster reform and wants to see that move.  So why hasn&#8217;t he been more prominent in calling for that?  And is he pressuring Manchin and Sinema to move on that issue privately?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  I wouldn&#8217;t say that his comments yesterday were conveying a new position on his view on the filibuster.  His full comment was &#8212;<br><br>Q    But what did he mean by saying that Manchin and Sinema are standing in the way of his agenda, essentially?  What was he referencing?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  That&#8217;s not exactly what he said.  I think it&#8217;s important to quote him directly.  What he said was: I hear all the folks on TV saying, “Why doesn&#8217;t Biden get this done?”  Well, because Biden only has a majority of, effectively, four votes in the House and a tie in the Senate, with two members of the Senate who vote more with my Republican friends. <br><br>He&#8217;s not &#8212; he was not giving a specific commentary on a policy.  He was conveying, again, that sometimes that&#8217;s the summary &#8212; shorthand version that he sees on cable news at times.  Again, it&#8217;s not always the forum that&#8217;s easy to provide guidance on how a bill becomes a law.<br><br>His view on the filibuster continues to be that there should be a path forward for Democrats and Republicans to make voting easier, to move forward on progress for the American people.  That position hasn&#8217;t changed.  And he was not intending to convey something different. <br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q    Thank you.  Back on the ransomware attack, is the U.S. going to retaliate?  And, realistically, what options are on the table?  Is a counterattack an option?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  Well, one, let me say &#8212; not to get ahead of your line of questioning, but I assume this will be a question.  So we do expect this to be one of the issues that the President will discuss with President Putin at the summit.  That will be two weeks from today, if my &#8212; if my calendar is correct in my mind. <br><br>And in terms of considerations of &#8212; you know, we&#8217;re not taking any options off the table, in terms of how we may respond.  But, of course, there&#8217;s an internal policy review process to consider that.  We&#8217;re in direct touch with the Russians, as well, to convey our concerns about these reports. <br><br>Q    You mentioned the meeting.  When it comes to this issue, what does success look like at that discussion?  I mean, what are you looking to accomplish when the President walks away from that table, when it comes to cybersecurity?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Well, first, let me say that, you know, this is an issue that we have discussed with the Russian government &#8212; this specific issue &#8212; and we&#8217;ve discussed it in the past, and delivered the message that responsible states do not harbor ransomware criminals.<br><br>As we&#8217;ve also noted from here, and I noted in the beginning: Obviously, ransomware attacks &#8212; we&#8217;ve seen them increase over a period of time.  It&#8217;s an increasing threat to the private sector and to our critical infrastructure.  And there are other countries, many of whom we will see when the President is in Europe, who have similar concerns.  So we expect this to be an issue of discussion throughout the President&#8217;s trip, I will say.<br><br>In terms of what success looks like coming out of the summit, I can&#8217;t predict that at this point in time.  But I can convey to you that this will certainly be a topic of discussion &#8212; that harboring criminal entities that are intending to do harm, that are doing harm to the critical infrastructure in the United States is not acceptable.  We&#8217;re not going to stand by that; we will raise that, and we are not going to take options off the table.<br><br>Q    And in those conversations with the Russian government so far, do you get a sense that they are taking this seriously?  Are they going to be taking steps to try and stop these bad actors?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  I am &#8212; as I&#8217;ve said before, I&#8217;m blissfully not a spokesperson for the Kremlin, so I will let them speak for themselves.  But I can assure you that we are raising this through the highest levels of the U.S. government.  It will be a topic of discussion in direct, one-on-one discussions &#8212; or direct discussions with President Putin and President Biden happening in just a couple of weeks. <br><br>And certainly, protecting our own infrastructure in the United States is of the utmost national security importance. <br><br>Q    And just one more on this topic, because the Russians are outlining some of the things they would also like to discuss during the summit.  The foreign minister, Lavrov, indicated that Russia wants to be discussing the human rights violations in the U.S., saying they&#8217;re following with interest the persecution of those persons who are accused of the riots on January 6 this year.  I&#8217;m wondering what you make of that.  Where do you think this is coming from?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Well, we don&#8217;t use the Russian government as our guide to human rights models in the world.  But I will say that the President has not held back in his view that the attacks on January 6th were a mark on democracy, were a dark day in our own democracy.  And certainly, I’m sure he’d be happy to repeat that.<br><br>But the President’s view is that there are a range of topics that we should be discussing in this meeting.  We’ll have more to preview for it, probably in the days in advance of this summit, including on &#8212; his agenda is, of course, these cyberattacks and the use of ransomware, harboring criminal entities in your own country; also is their aggressive actions in Ukraine; and also is &#8212; are areas where there can be an opportunity to work together, including nuclear capabilities and security.  So, lots to discuss.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q    Just to put a fine point on this very quickly: Is it President Biden&#8217;s view that President Putin can stop these attacks, these hacks, from occurring if he wanted to?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Well, I would say the President &#8212; President Biden certainly thinks that President Putin and the Russian government has a role to play in stopping and preventing these attacks; hence, it&#8217;s a &#8212; it will be a topic of discussion when they meet in two weeks. <br><br>Q    Does the President believe that Vladimir Putin is testing him right now, ahead of the summit?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  I&#8217;m not going to give any further analysis on that other than to tell you that our view is that when there are criminal entities within a country, they certainly have a responsibility, and it is a role that the government can play.  And, again, that will be a discussion at the summit.<br><br>Q    Of all the threats that the White House has to juggle right now &#8212; and, of course, there are a lot &#8212; how high does ransomware fall on that list right now?  Has it gone dramatically higher in the course of this administration?  Does it need to be higher than it is right now?  Where is it? <br><br>MS. PSAKI:  You know how I love rank ordering our focuses and our threats.  (Laughs.)<br><br>Q    How &#8212; but it’s been growing dramatically, obviously.  Right? <br><br>MS. PSAKI:  That is true.  And I &#8212;<br><br>Q    This is now a bigger issue.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  And, Peter, I just said that.  I think that this is &#8212; this attack that we&#8217;ve seen over the last couple of days, and certainly following the attack that we saw several weeks ago, is also a reminder to the private sector about the need and the importance of hardening their own cybersecurity protections, of investing in and putting in place protections in their own systems. <br><br>We have given guidance for some time, from the federal government, and it is up to a number of these private sector entities to protect themselves as well.<br><br>Q    The Steamship Authority in Massachusetts reports that they were just the victims of a hack.  Has that been communicated to the White House?  Are you involved?  Do you have any comment or message, or anybody to attribute that to?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  I have seen those reports.  They &#8212; they just came out. <br><br>Q    They just reported it.  Yeah.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Yes, exactly.  I just don&#8217;t have anything more for you on it, but we can see if there&#8217;s more later this afternoon.<br><br>Q    All good.  Last one, if I can, then.  In March, we heard from the National Security Advisor, Jake Sullivan.  He came in here and told us that the U.S., “in the near future” &#8212; to his words &#8212; would name who&#8217;s responsible for the hack on the Microsoft Exchange. <br><br>So can you tell us who that is &#8212; multiple &#8212; several months have passed &#8212; and what the holdup might be? <br><br>MS. PSAKI:  I&#8217;m happy to check with our national security team and see if they have an update.  As you know, they are quite careful and thorough &#8212; I should say, “thorough” is probably the right word &#8212; in how they review and assess and provide public guidance.  But we can see if there&#8217;s anything more they can report out.<br><br>Q    Is the prevailing theory still that it&#8217;s China?  Or are you &#8212; can you not go any further than he did then?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  I don&#8217;t think I have an update on it from what we&#8217;ve provided in the past. <br><br>Q    Thank you.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Go ahead. <br><br>Q    Thanks, Jen.  Why does the White House think there&#8217;s a shortage of workers right now? <br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Well, we&#8217;ve talked about this a bit in the past, but I’m happy to go through it. <br><br>So, one, our view is that it&#8217;s going to take time for workers to regain confidence in the safety of the workplace; reestablish childcare, school, and commuting arrangements; and finish getting vaccinated.  And even when individuals get their first dose &#8212; we&#8217;ve seen a huge increase in that, as I started the briefing talking about &#8212; it&#8217;s about a five- to six-week cycle.  So we have expected that to have an impact.<br><br>At the same time, as we look at all of the data, we know that our economy is growing faster than at any time &#8212; than any time in the last 40 years.  We&#8217;re creating an average of 500,000 jobs a month, up from 60,000 a month before the President took office.  And we&#8217;re continuing to put in place policies and measures to ensure that we&#8217;re helping people make ends meet and we&#8217;re helping the economy continue to grow. <br><br>Q    And you mentioned thoughts about safety.  You&#8217;re celebrating the number of vaccinations today.  You say the vaccines work.  COVID cases are way down.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  You’re right.<br><br>Q    Is there any thought here that some of the worker shortage could be driven by the extra $300 in weekly unemployment benefits through September? <br><br>MS. PSAKI:  I will say, Peter, that our economists and our assessment and the assessment of many economists out there is that the impact &#8212; the largest impact are on issues related to the pandemic. <br><br>And, yes, you&#8217;re right that the increased numbers &#8212; that&#8217;s a good sign; it&#8217;s a positive sign.  But it&#8217;s a five- to six-week cycle.  So the data that was taken for the May jobs number &#8212; the jobs numbers that came out for April and early May was from early April.  That&#8217;s almost two months ago, right?  We&#8217;ll see.  We&#8217;ll have jobs numbers come out on Friday.<br><br>People &#8212; the vaccination rates are continuing to go up.  But in terms of people being fully safe, fully vaccinated, it&#8217;s going to take some time.  We always expected that to be a couple of months, and we expect to see continuing improvement in the numbers.<br><br>Q    On the JBS hack, these hackers based in Russia have disrupted American gas supplies and American meat supplies.  Why do you think that these ransomware attacks have been rising since President Biden took office? <br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Well, first, I would say these are private sector entities who have a responsibility to put in place measures to protect their own cybersecurity.<br><br>As it relates to why criminal actors are taking actions against private sector entities, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m the right one to speak to that.<br><br>Q    So, a total coincidence?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  I think you could certainly go track down those cyber criminals in Russia and have a good chat with them. <br><br>Q    Okay.  If you have any leads, we&#8217;ll take that.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Okay.<br><br>Q    And then, on immigration, has the President or the Vice President seen the video from last Friday of a five-year- old boy dropped off along the border, yelling to the adults who abandoned him, “No, no, don&#8217;t go &#8212; no”? <br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Well, I&#8217;ve seen the video.  It is heartbreaking and the reason we continue to be very clear: Irregularly migrating to the United States puts ourselves and others at risk.  That&#8217;s why we relate &#8212; relaunched certain efforts to build a more fair and orderly immigration system, including programs like the Central American Minors Program that allows kids who are eligible to apply from within country. <br><br>But I don&#8217;t think anyone, whether a parent or not, would have watched that video and not feel heartbroken by a five-year- old, I think, screaming at the border.<br><br>Q    Thanks.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Go ahead. <br><br>Q    Thanks, Jen.  A couple of questions about the COVID numbers.  You talked about the latest vaccination rates.  Does the Biden administration still consider herd immunity to be realistic and achievable? <br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Well, I would say, first, that Dr. Fauci has spoken to this in the kind of terminology of herd immunity and, kind of, refuted that as the right definition of how we should look to how we&#8217;re going to make progress.  And that&#8217;s why we have set out a goal of getting 70 percent of the American population vaccinated by July 4th.  There&#8217;s still a lot of work to do.  About a dozen states have met that requirement.  That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re launching this big initiative over the past &#8212; over the next month.<br><br>But what Dr. Fauci and other medical experts have conveyed is that it&#8217;s really going to be up to local communities and states to see what their vaccination rate is and make determinations about what&#8217;s going to work locally.  It&#8217;s &#8212; that is how the assessments will need to be made. <br><br>Q    And you talked about the 90 percent drop in cases.  Does the White House worry that as the number of cases drops, that these holdouts will actually be more reluctant to get vaccinated because they won&#8217;t be as worried that they themselves will get sick? <br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Well, first, that&#8217;s one of the reasons why continuing to reiterate that if you&#8217;re not vaccinated, you are not safe.  You&#8217;re not safe against others who are not vaccinated who may carry the virus.  The individuals who can benefit from all of the new guidance the CDC has put out, who can go to concerts and go to baseball games &#8212; I was going to say football; not quite there yet &#8212; go to their kids&#8217; soccer games and not wear a mask, those are vaccinated individuals. <br><br>There&#8217;s huge incentives to getting vaccinated, but it doesn&#8217;t mean that individuals who are not vaccinated are safe from getting the virus.<br><br>And while, yes, we&#8217;ve made a lot of progress, there are still communities where the percentage is higher than it should be, where there are still larger numbers of young adults who are not vaccinated; those are many of the communities that we’re focused on in our month-long effort.<br><br>Q    In the President&#8217;s speech yesterday, when he laid out his new economic equity measures, one of the things he didn&#8217;t talk about was student loan forgiveness, and that&#8217;s something he talked about a lot on the campaign trail. <br><br>We know that student debt is a big driver in racial &#8212; in economic inequality.  So why didn&#8217;t he include that?  And where &#8212; where does the White House want to go on that issue?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Well, first, I would say that one of the ways anyone can know out there about how much the President cares about student debt and student loans is by simply looking at his budget and the budget he proposed and rolled out last Friday.  He makes two years of community college free, along with a major increase in Pell grants that will drastically reduce the cost of an education beyond high school. <br><br>The American Families Plan, which he proposed, we still need to get it, of course, signed into law &#8212; or passed and signed into law, which is included also in the President&#8217;s budget.  It includes a historic $47 billion of investments in HBCUs, Tribal colleges and universities, and minority-serving institutions.  And these institutions are critical to helping underrepresented students move to the top of the income ladder. <br><br>And so President Biden is calling for a historic investment in these areas, and those are things that are laid out specifically in his budget and shows his desire and commitment to level the playing field and provide necessary assistance.<br><br>Q    But why doesn&#8217;t the budget include $10,000 in student loan debt forgiveness, for example?  That&#8217;s something that he called on Congress to do when he was a candidate.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  And he&#8217;d be happy to sign a bill into law if they passed that bill, and he’d look forward to having it on his desk.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q    Thank you, Jen.  Just a couple of follow-ups on JBS.  Obviously, the White House is engaging directly with Russia on this, and we were wondering if Russia has offered any cooperation or help in tracking down these hackers. <br><br>MS. PSAKI:  I&#8217;m just not going to be reading out Russia&#8217;s view or their role here.  You can certainly ask them those questions. <br><br>Q    And considering &#8212; this is obviously the third Russia-linked attack this year, and we understand that the President will bring this up in his meeting with President Putin &#8212; but is the administration really considering any actions in addition to that, just to make sure that this doesn&#8217;t happen?  Sanctions or any other actions that are perhaps on the table? <br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  I mean, as I said, I think, in response to an earlier question: We&#8217;re not taking options off of the table. <br><br>But it&#8217;s just an opportunity &#8212; there will be an opportunity for the President to discuss this directly with President Putin, to reiterate the fact that we believe that responsible states do not harbor ransomware criminals and that &#8212; and as he said, as we said, around Colonial and the Colonial hack &#8212; or the Colonial ransomware attack &#8212; we will continue to be in direct touch with Moscow.  We will continue to make the case that responsible countries need to take decisive action against ransomware networks.<br><br>At the same time, as I noted a little bit earlier too, we&#8217;re doing our own review of a range of options as well from here. <br><br>Q    And I have one on the surplus vaccines.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Sure. <br><br>Q    Has there been any decision made on those 80 million vaccines?  And will the President offer any updates on that today?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  He won’t offer any updates on that today. Hopefully, we’ll have more for you on that soon.  I know there&#8217;s a lot of interest.  And as I&#8217;ve noted earlier &#8212; or previously &#8212; what we want to do is not just convey, hopefully, some of &#8212; where some of the vaccine may be going, but also what our approach will be to ensure that it is distributed in an equitable manner around the world.  So all of that would be a part of any announcement at the appropriate time.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q    Thanks, Jen.  During the campaign, Biden promised to host a summit for democracy during the first year of his presidency.  Can you give us an update on if that&#8217;s taking place, when it might take place? <br><br>MS. PSAKI:  I don&#8217;t have any date or schedule for you.  We have some time left in the year, fortunately, but I don&#8217;t have any update for you on the timing.<br><br>Q    Is he still planning to do it in his first year?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  That &#8212; that still remains the plan. <br><br>Q    Okay.  And then can you say anything more about the specific mandate that the President gave to the Vice President on voting &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Sure.<br><br>Q    &#8212; that he mentioned yesterday?  I mean, is there &#8212; how is he going to measure success on that? <br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Well, first, let me say that the President sees the Vice President as an important partner and somebody who can work to take on challenging and hard initiatives.  That&#8217;s the role of the modern-day Vice President.  And she actually asked to run point and lead on voting rights.  It&#8217;s an issue that she is personally committed to and passionate about.<br><br>As she conveyed in her statement yesterday, she expects in the week &#8212; weeks ahead to engage not just with the American people, but with voting rights organizations, community organizations, the private sector to help strengthen and uplift &#8212; uplift efforts on voting rights nationwide.  That includes working with members of Congress, certainly, to move legislation forward &#8212; something the President strongly supports.  It also includes working with local organizations, working with states to see how to make voting more accessible to people across the country. <br><br>So, I think the President is looking to work with the Vice President as a partner and e- &#8212; and looking forward to her taking on this important initiative, something that&#8217;s a priority to him as well.  And I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;ll be regularly updated on her progress.<br><br>Q    Does he expect the Vice President to travel to these states that have imposed voting restrictions in their state laws?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  I think the Vice President will have more to say about what &#8212; how she will approach this effort.  As you know, she&#8217;s traveling to the Northern Triangle over the next couple of days on one of the other initiatives she&#8217;s leading, but I expect she’ll have more to say in the coming weeks.<br><br>Q    And just briefly, how does he expect the Vice President to prioritize these multiple things that she has in her &#8212; in her agenda?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Well, I would say, just as the President has to balance a number of different priorities &#8212; whether it&#8217;s the American Jobs Plan or working to protect us from ransomware attacks or preparing for an international summit and all of the other entities that are on the President&#8217;s plate &#8212; a modern-day Vice President does the same thing.<br><br>So he&#8217;s confident in her ability to take on a robust agenda, which she certainly has on her plate.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q    Yeah, thanks, Jen.  I&#8217;m curious if you can kind of describe &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  I’ll come to you next. <br><br>Sorry, go ahead.<br><br>Q    I&#8217;m sorry.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  It’s okay.  Go ahead.<br><br>Q    No, go ahead.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Oh, so chivalrous there.  Go ahead.  Okay.<br><br>Q    Okay.<br><br>Q    I&#8217;m just curious &#8212; (laughter).  See how I did that? <br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Sorry, we’ll come back to you.<br><br>Q    If you can describe for us: How thin is the President&#8217;s patience when it comes to negotiating some of these bipartisan agreements he wants to see &#8212; not just with infrastructure today, but, for example, whether it&#8217;s police reform or the Jobs Plan &#8212; at some point, does he say to his fellow Democrats, “We just have to go at it alone”?  And then does that mean we&#8217;re going to see more executive orders as a result?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Well, first, I would say that the President has a bit of experience legislating, and his approach is to look for means, ways we can find common ground.  That&#8217;s exactly what he&#8217;s going to do when he meets with Senator Capito this afternoon. <br><br>“Negotiations” mean both sides continue to make moves toward each other, both sides continue to look for areas where they agree.  And that&#8217;s what he&#8217;s prepared to do, and he&#8217;s hopeful this meeting is an opportunity to do.<br><br>At the same time, we&#8217;re working on a number of different paths.  There&#8217;s discussions between bipartisan members in the Senate about how they might come to agreement on a path forward on a historic investment in infrastructure, on a version of the American Jobs Plan.  He&#8217;s eager to see what they have to offer.<br><br>We also know, next week, Congressman DeFazio is going to be marking up the American Jobs Plan in the House &#8212; something a lot of members and Democrats in the House are quite excited about. <br><br>So, I would say that we&#8217;re working on many channels.  He&#8217;s going to have discussions with all of these entities and parties.  And he knows that sometimes in this journey and this path, you have to keep a range of options on the table.<br><br>Q    And his level of patience?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  I would say he wouldn&#8217;t have been in the Senate for 36 years if he wasn&#8217;t quite patient.  So &#8212; but, you know, him &#8212; patience is not unending, and he wants to make progress. His only line in the sand is inaction.  He wants to sign a bill into law this summer. <br><br>But I would also remind you that the American Rescue Plan passed in a very quick timeline for how legislation moves forward &#8212; very fast. <br><br>And there&#8217;s historic legislation &#8212; the Affordable Care Act, for example, the Vi- &#8212; the President worked closely on &#8212; that took a year.  We&#8217;re not advising that&#8217;s the timeline, but just to suggest that sometimes these efforts can take a little bit of time. <br><br>He&#8217;s working to move things forward.  And there are certainly items on &#8212; you know, the clock is certainly ticking because there are items like the markup next week that will drive discussion by members of Congress.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q    So the President has talked a lot about seeing democracy as under attack.  And his speech Monday, I think &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.<br><br>Q    &#8212; was pretty blunt about that. <br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Mm-hmm.<br><br>Q    He talked a lot about voting rights in that speech.  Can you just clarify how he sees the stakes of these bills, like in Texas?  Does he truly see them as an existential threat to democracy?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Well, I would say that, first, he believes that the Texas legislation is a part of a concerted attack on our democracy being advanced, as we see &#8212; have seen, not just in Texas, as you well know, but in states across the country, on the basis of the same repeatedly disproven lies that led to the assault on our nation&#8217;s Capitol on January 6th.<br><br>So, that is, of course, of great concern to the President.  He thinks that must stop.  It must be easier, not harder, for all eligible voters to vote &#8212; to register and cast their ballots.  We need to move forward and not backward. <br><br>And the fact of the matter is that the Texas legislation would make it harder to vote in a state where it is already too hard for many people to vote, but it&#8217;s not the only state where we&#8217;re seeing this troubling trend.<br><br>But this is one of the reasons why he asked his Vice &#8212; or he &#8212; she asked for it, but he certainly was thrilled to have her leading the effort on voting rights moving forward, given this is a huge priority to him and a huge priority to her as well. <br><br>Q    A question on a much different scope.  I have a follow-up on the free beer announcement.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  (Laughs.)<br><br>Q    Can you just clarify, because Anheuser-Busch says this is in partnership with the White House.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Mm-hmm.<br><br>Q    Can you clarify what that means?  Is like the federal government subsidizing this at all?  And also, are there any concerns that this is kind of &#8212; the way that they&#8217;re going about this &#8212; with like, “Upload a picture of yourself” &#8212; that there&#8217;s any sort of data-harvesting aspect of this promotion?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Well, I think all that “in partnership” means is that we&#8217;ve been encouraging private sector entities to take actions to incentivize people to get vaccinated, given we know that will ensure that more Americans have shots in their arms, are safe, are healthy, and communities can return back to normal. <br><br>You know, obviously, as it relates, we take data security and people&#8217;s privacy incredibly seriously.  And, certainly, if there was an area of concern, we would speak out against that.  But we have seen a number of these actions by private sector companies be quite effective, and more shots in arms is a good thing. <br><br>Go ahead, Kaitlan.<br><br>Q    The meeting with Senator Capito today, should we expect President Biden to give her any kind of deadline for a major breakthrough on these talks to happen?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  I wouldn&#8217;t expect this meeting to be an exchange of paper.  It would be more of a discussion.  And certainly, we&#8217;ll see what comes out of the meeting and what the appropriate next step is.  But I don&#8217;t know &#8212; I&#8217;m not going to predetermine that before the meeting even begins.<br><br>Q    And should we expect it to be one-on-one, or will White House staff be in the room, just to clarify?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  I would expect at least a portion of it to be one-on-one, if not &#8212; if not the whole meeting, but I can check on that for you too. <br><br>Q    Okay.  And just to follow up on your comments on what President Biden said about Senator Manchin and Senator Sinema: Are you saying that that was not a criticism of the two of them?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  It was not.  No.  He considers them both friends.  He considers them both good working partners.  And he also believes that, in democracy, we don&#8217;t have to see eye to eye on every detail of every single issue in order to work together, and he certainly thinks that reflects their relationship. <br><br>Q    But even saying “two Democrats vote with Republicans more than they do with their own party” &#8212; <br><br>MS. PSAKI:  “With my Republican friends.”  I would say that the fact that the President is having Senator Capito here today and has been having ongoing discussions with Republicans in the Senate and that he&#8217;s eager to find a path forward on bipartisan work certainly tells you, I think, what you need to know about what he thinks about working with people even when there&#8217;s disagreement.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q    Just a few quick ones.  The NAACP criticized Biden&#8217;s plan, as was mentioned earlier, about not including the cancellation of student debt. <br><br>In April, Ron Klain said that the President had asked the Education Department to prepare a memo on wiping out debt for executive action.  And he said, “Hopefully, we&#8217;ll see that in the next few weeks.”  Is there any update on that memo about, kind of, what the President might do on that front?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  I don&#8217;t have an update.  It was Department of Education, but also a legal review as well. <br><br>Q    Okay.  And then one question on Israel: Does Biden have a view on Naftali Bennett’s past statements about annexing the West Bank and negating a two-state solution?  How will Biden approach clear differences there on that issue?  And does he still think he has a partner for peace in an Israeli government led by Bennett? <br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Well, we&#8217;re not going to weigh in on an ongoing political process in a foreign country &#8212; in Israel or anywhere in the world.  I think you&#8217;re probably &#8212; know well what the President&#8217;s view is on a two-state solution and how he believes it&#8217;s the only path forward for lasting peace in the region.<br><br>Q    And then just a quick follow-up.  Do you know if Bennett and Biden have met before, they’ve &#8212; or any interaction in person?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  It&#8217;s a good question.  I don&#8217;t know if they have met in the past or have a prior relationship.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q    President Biden campaigned on ending the federal death penalty.  When is he going to take steps to do that?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  He has &#8212; he did campaign on that and has talked about his views on the death penalty.  I don&#8217;t have any update on any forward action. <br><br>Q    But isn’t his delay there a sign that perhaps he doesn&#8217;t feel as strongly about this as maybe he sounded when he was campaigning?  The &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a sign of that.  There&#8217;s a legal process and a Department of Justice process that would be &#8212; would be standard in any scenario here. <br><br>Q    When did he change his mind on the death penalty?  Because during the &#8217;94 &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  I did not convey he changed his mind.<br><br>Q    The &#8217;94 Crime Bill expanded the amount of crimes that receive &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  He spoke to this pretty extensively on the campaign, and that&#8217;s his position.  I think we&#8217;re going to have to move on.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q    I wanted to just &#8212; given what you said that his position hasn&#8217;t changed on the filibuster, I just want to go back to the vote last week in the Senate on the January 6th commission &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Sure.<br><br>Q    &#8212; the fact that there were 54 “yes” votes, 35 “no” votes.  The bill failed.  This is an insurrection that the President has called an “unprecedented assault.” <br><br>I&#8217;m just curious if that math makes sense to this President and if that outcome would be acceptable should it repeat later this month when the Senate takes up voting rights.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  When you say the &#8220;math makes sense,” what do you mean by that exactly?<br><br>Q    I mean the fact that 54 lawmakers in the Senate voted “yes,” 35 voted “no,” and the bill did not pass. <br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Well, I would say, first, that the President doesn&#8217;t see a reason for anyone to have voted against that bill, so he doesn&#8217;t understand that version of the math as a starting point. <br><br> He continues to believe that, given that was a dark day in our democracy &#8212; a day that, I think, we will all remember; he will remember, certainly, as President, as a day that does not stand out as a model of what is possible in this country.<br><br>In terms of his view of the filibuster, you know, again, his position has not changed on that.  He does want to see accountability as it relates to &#8212; and he does want to see an assessment of what happened to prevent it from ever happening again.  And he is happy to talk with members of Congress about how to approach that moving forward.<br><br>As you all know, no President can wave a wand and pass a piece of legislation with 50 votes, when it requires 60.  That requires Congress to move forward with that action.<br><br>Q    But it seems like it requires only one more Democratic vote than currently exists for that, and that vote happens to be a person who the President did seem to single out yesterday.<br><br>So you&#8217;re saying that he didn&#8217;t change his position on the filibuster, and yet, you know, he&#8217;s saying things &#8212; I mean, his passion for voting rights was evident yesterday when he spoke.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Mm-hmm.<br><br>Q    He&#8217;s saying, &#8220;We must find the courage…&#8221; &#8212; I&#8217;m quoting him &#8212; &#8220;…to change the things we know we can change.&#8221;<br><br>So, I just want to be very sure that you&#8217;re saying that: Should that outcome repeat itself later this month &#8212; if the Senate takes up voting rights, more than 50 lawmakers vote for a bill, but if the bill does not advance to his desk &#8212; is that something he&#8217;s going to be okay living with?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Again, I don&#8217;t think the President is okay with a January 6th commission not being in place.  He&#8217;s not okay with voting rights not passing.  And he will continue to advocate for both moving forward. <br><br>Go ahead. <br><br>Q    Yes.  As the President prepares for the summit with leaders of the NATO, some reports surfaced regarding spying on &#8212; on Germany.  How would that affect the summit and the &#8212; like, the reestablishment of the U.S.-NATO relations?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  I think you&#8217;re referring to the reports from 2014 &#8212; correct? &#8212; that dated back to, I will say, my last time in government. <br><br>I don&#8217;t &#8212; I wouldn&#8217;t say that &#8212; you know, in 2014, let me say, we issued a full &#8212; the United States issued a full review of our approach to overseas surveillance.  President Obama, at that time, issued a presidential directive that changed our approach in significant ways. <br><br>So that is a lot that has happened since &#8212; between the la- &#8212; over the last seven years.  And we will continue to work with our European allies and partners to address any questions through the appropriate national security channels.<br><br>But I can tell you that President Biden will be able to reassure President Merkel and President Macron about current U.S. posture.  And, you know, certainly we look forward to working together on a range of &#8212;<br><br>Q    And Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu said that, you know, he would stand against any agreement between &#8212; you know, with Iran, even if that would, you know, cause trouble with the Israeli-American relations.  Is there any reaction from the White House regarding that?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Sorry, the first part of your question was what?  It was about &#8212;<br><br>Q    You know, Netanyahu said that, like, he would stand against any agreement on &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Oh, on Iran.<br><br>Q    Yes.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Mm-hmm.<br><br>Q    And, you know, even if that would, you know, result in, like, tension with, you know, American-Israeli relations.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  That&#8217;s consistently been the Prime Minister&#8217;s position.  And what our responsibility is and the responsibility of President Biden is to act in the interests of the United States.  And our view is that putting in place a diplomatic agreement &#8212; an agreement where we can prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon, where we have returned to the visibility we had before the former President pulled out of that deal &#8212; is in our interest.<br><br>So we will continue to work and brief the leaders in Israel, as we have over the last several years, but our position hasn&#8217;t changed.<br><br>Q    Okay.  Last question, if I may.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Sure.<br><br>Q    You know, the Israelis requested a billion dollar, you know, in military aid after what had just happened.  You know, is the United States willing to and prepared to provide that aid?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  The President conveyed that &#8212; at his press conference he did with the leader of South Korea just a few weeks ago &#8212; that nothing has changed about our intention to provide assistance to the Israeli government and also our desire and interest in providing humanitarian and security assistance to the Palestinians as well. <br><br>So I expect those will continue.  I don&#8217;t have any assessment of any new request.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q    Thank you, Jen.  On the vaccination efforts: As of May 7th, only less than 7 percent of the ICE detainee population &#8212; about 22,000 detainees &#8212; have been vaccinated.  Where is that process going?  The ACLU has demanded this White House, via a letter, to speed up that process.  So do you have an update?<br><br>And also, how do you plan to vaccinate eligible unaccompanied minors who are in detention?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Well, on the first question, Immigration and Customs Enforcement &#8212; ICE &#8212; is firmly committed to the health and wellbeing and welfare of all those in custody.  COVID-19 vaccines for ICE detainees are being allocated by local and state health departments &#8212; that&#8217;s how they are distributed &#8212; based on availability and the state&#8217;s vaccine implementation plans.  So that&#8217;s where they directly come, not from &#8212; not directly from the federal government. <br><br>Additionally, DHS&#8217;s chief medical officer is rapidly working on scaling our own internal capability to vaccinate detainees in our care across the country.  So that would be an additional step in addition to the state and local allocations, but it is a focus and a priority.<br><br>In terms of unaccompanied minors, some eligible unaccompanied children have already received a COVID-19 vaccine.  We&#8217;re working with our state partners to implement broader vaccine distribution.  In keeping with CDC guidance, it hasn&#8217;t been an extensive period of time where children under the age of 18 have been eligible. <br><br>Obviously, these allocations are distributed across states, but, of course, they&#8217;ve been broadly available for some time in the country, so this should provide greater access to the vaccine to unaccompanied children.<br><br>Q    And is the President aware of the current situation in Nicaragua, where the government is harassing journalists, activists, even a presidential candidate, and is claiming &#8212; is investigating them for money laundering in that country with really no legal basis?  Is he aware?  Is the State Department working on this?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  I know the State Department is, and I&#8217;d certainly send you to them.  On any specific comment from here, obviously, we would speak out against any harassment of journalists, individuals, leaders, the &#8212; you know, crushing of freedom of speech, expression that it sounds like is occurring in this case. <br><br>Q    I think we have an out.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Okay.  All right, thank you, everyone.  I&#8217;ll look forward to seeing you tomorrow. <br><br>1:09 P.M. EDT</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Navy-Marine Corps Memorial Stadium <br>Annapolis, Maryland</p>



<p>10:21 A.M. EDT<br><br>THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Good morning.  (Applause.)  Acting Secretary Thomas Harker, General David Berger, Admiral Mike Gilday: Looking out at these midshipmen, I know we are all filled with pride.<br><br>Vice Admiral Sean Buck, Captain T.R. Buchanan, faculty and staff: Thank you for educating such a fine crew.<br><br>Alumni, thank you for the support you have shown over these years to this great institution.<br><br>And to my Military Aide, Lieutenant Colonel Frank Machniak, who graduated in 2004, I am very proud to have you with me here today.<br><br>Family and friends of these graduates, thank you for the sacrifices you have already made and will make.<br><br>And I also want to acknowledge Kim and John Johnson.  Your son was taken far too soon.  And I promise you that he will not be forgotten.<br><br>And finally, to the Class of 2021, congratulations.  Congratulations.  (Applause.)  And look how far you&#8217;ve come.  So, you endured 0530 PT and pro-no exams.  You excelled on athletic fields and in academic exercises.  You enjoyed the fare at Dillo’s &#8212; (laughter) &#8212; I know &#8212; karaoke at Harvest.  (Applause.)  You guys rolled up your sleeves and you got vaccinated.  And you made it to this day.  You made it to this day.  (Applause.) <br><br>And this day &#8212; this day that is not only a commencement, this day that is a commissioning.  And in a few minutes, you will take an oath.  And it&#8217;s actually the same oath I took as Vice President.  An oath to support our Constitution and defend it against all enemies.  An oath that has its roots in the founding of our nation.  And no matter what changes in our world, the charge in this oath is constant.  <br><br>Remember that as you walk out into the world, because the world you all are walking into is rapidly changing.  In fact, we are at a significant turning point.  Just look at the last several months, and you know what I&#8217;m talking about.  <br><br>And look at several moments in our nation&#8217;s history for perspective.  Think about it: There was the world before the stock market crashed in 1929 and the world after.  The world before the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 and the world after.  The world before the Civil Rights Act in 1964 and the world after.  The world before the Berlin Wall fell in 1989 and the world after.  <br><br>At some of these critical moments, our nation was compelled to take a hard look at both our priorities and our preparedness.<br><br>And another turning point was September 11th &#8212; 20 years ago, this year &#8212; when airplanes hit the Twin Towers and our Pentagon, when Flight 93 crashed in Pennsylvania.  That day shaped your entire life, and it shaped our entire nation.  It tested our systems, our structures, our very standing in the world.    <br><br>Well, Midshipmen, we are now entering the next era.  A new age, a new epoch, with its own tests, with its own challenges, and with its own opportunities.<br><br>The global pandemic &#8212; you see, of course &#8212; has accelerated what was happening before, and it has accelerated our world into a new era.  It has forever influenced our perspective.<br><br>And if we weren&#8217;t clear before, we know now our world is interconnected, our world is interdependent, and our world is fragile.  <br><br>Just think, a deadly pandemic can spread throughout the globe in just a matter of months.  A gang of hackers can disrupt the fuel supply of a whole seaboard.  One country&#8217;s carbon emissions can threaten the sustainability of the whole Earth. <br><br>This, Midshipmen, is the era we are in, and it is unlike any era that came before.  So the challenge now &#8212; the challenge before us now is how to mount a modern defense to these modern threats.  <br><br>So, let me share with you, for example, a personal experience.  A few years ago, when I was in the United States Senate, I visited the USS Scranton.  It was outside of San Diego, California.  And at the time, I was also a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee.<br><br>So, when I was aboard the vessel, I asked the officers &#8212; I said, “Hey, tell me, what does it take to protect such a valuable asset against cyberattacks?”  And they told me, “You know, it’s pretty simple: equipment and experts.”  Well, the way I see it, Midshipmen, you &#8212; you &#8212; you are those experts.  <br><br>On the issue of cybersecurity: Foreign advisor- &#8212; adversaries have their sights set on our military technology,<br>our intellectual property, our elections, our critical infrastructure.<br><br>The ransomware attack by criminal hackers earlier this month &#8212; well, that was a warning shot.  In fact, there have been many warning shots. <br><br>So, we must defend our nation against these threats and, at the same time, we must make advances in things that you’ve been learning &#8212; things like quantum computing and artificial intelligence and robotics &#8212; and things that will put our nation at a strategic advantage.  And you will be the ones to do it.  You will be the ones to do it because the United States military is the best, the bravest, and the most brilliant.  (Applause.) <br><br>And just think, from walkie-talkies, to the Internet, to satellite navigation, the United States military has been on the forefront of research, development, and technological advancement.  That is a point of American pride.  And as I look out at all of you, I know you will build on that leadership. <br><br>And then, of course, there is climate change, which is a very real threat to our national security.  And I look at you and I know you are among the experts who will navigate and mitigate this threat.  You are ocean engineers who will help navigate ships through thinning ice.  You are mechanical engineers who will help reinforce sinking bases.  You are electrical engineers who will soon help convert solar and wind energy into power, convert solar and wind energy into combat power. <br><br>And just ask any Marine today, would she rather carry 20 pounds of batteries or a rolled-up solar panel?  And I am positive she will tell you a solar panel, and so would he.  (Laughter and applause.) <br><br>The American people are depending on you: the best, the bravest, the most brilliant.  We saw this during COVID-19, when Americans watched how members of our military helped vaccinate our nation.  Because you know biological threats like pandemics and infectious diseases are yet another threat in this era, and you are confronting this threat.<br><br>Our military helped develop the technology that made the vaccine possible.  Naval researchers also figured out how to use 3D knitting machines to make masks.  Naval labs monitored the spread of the disease.  And the Marine Corps and the Navy are leading on making the connection between the pandemic and medical readiness of our fighting forces for the future.<br><br>Class of 2021, you are prepared for all of this.  You are prepared for any threat.  And you are prepared for this new era. <br><br>And it is not only because of the knowledge and the skills you gained here or those you will continue to learn, but it&#8217;s because of something more.  It&#8217;s because of who each of you is.  It is because of who, collectively, you are. <br><br>So, as I conclude today, that&#8217;s what I want to talk about.  I want to talk about you.  As Vice President, I&#8217;ve come to know the United States Navy quite well.  Every day, in fact, I&#8217;m surrounded by sailors and Marines and your tradition and your history.  And I mean that literally. <br><br>So, I often travel on Marine Two.  In fact, that&#8217;s how I arrived today.  My residence is on the grounds of the United States Naval Observatory.  My West Wing office features a desk built by Seabees from timbers of the USS Constitution.  My ceremonial office &#8212; my ceremonial office was once occupied by the Secretary of the Navy.  And displayed there, I have placed the shoulder boards of your brigade commander, Midshipman Sydney Barber. <br><br>And so here&#8217;s what I know.  Midshipmen, you are tireless.  You are ambitious.  You are a fierce fighting force.  You are idealists in the truest sense.  You are the embodiment of American aspiration. <br><br>So hold on to that.  Because in your career, you may witness some of the worst of humanity.  But promise that you will never forget the best of who we are, that you will never forget the ideals you stand for: duty, honor, loyalty.  Fight for those ideals, and fight for our democracy. <br><br>And remember, our Constitution is not only something to defend; it is a guide.  It is a guide for your service.  It begins with three simple words: &#8220;We, the people.&#8221;  Not &#8220;I.&#8221;  &#8220;We.&#8221;  Our nation was designed to be a team sport.  And we are in this together. <br><br>So, you know, finally, I&#8217;ll just share with you: On my way to the stadium this morning, I stopped by the cemetery to pay my respects to my dear former colleague, a great and courageous American: Senator John McCain.  And, yes.  (Applause.)<br><br>So, most people don&#8217;t know, he wanted to be buried next to his best friend who he met on the Yard: Admiral Chuck Larson.  That is the ultimate example of what I mean &#8212; &#8220;in it together.&#8221; <br><br>So, Midshipmen, throughout our history, officers in the United States Navy, officers in the United States Marine have risked everything to defend our freedoms.  Today, you will swear to do the same.  You are the next links in the chain. <br><br>And so, Midshipmen, when you stand to take the oath, I want you to know that, as we embark on this new era, President Joe Biden and I, our entire nation have great faith in you.  And we are proud of you &#8212; so very, very proud. <br><br>Congratulations again.  May God bless you.  And may God bless the United States of America.  Thank you.  (Applause.) <br><br>10:39 A.M. EDT      </p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>National Month of Action will mobilize national organizations, local government leaders, community-based and faith-based partners, businesses, employers, social media influencers, celebrities, athletes, colleges, young people, and thousands of volunteers</em></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>The President will highlight additional efforts by businesses and organizations across the country to advance equity and make it even easier to get vaccinated</em></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>The Vice President will lead a National Vaccination Tour to encourage vaccinations in key communities across the country</em></p>



<p>Today, President Biden will announce a National Month of Action to mobilize an all-of-America sprint to get 70% of U.S. adults at least one shot by July 4<sup>th</sup>, so that more people can get the protection they need to be safe from a pandemic that has taken the lives of nearly 600,000 Americans.</p>



<p>Throughout the month, national organizations, local government leaders, community-based and faith-based partners, businesses, employers, social media influencers, celebrities, athletes, colleges, young people, and thousands of volunteers across the nation will work together to get their communities vaccinated.</p>



<p>Today, the President will announce actions that will make it even easier to get vaccinated, mobilize the country around vaccine outreach and education efforts, and incentivize vaccination. Additionally, organizations and businesses from across the country continue to step up and respond to the President’s call to action.</p>



<p>Thanks to the President’s whole-of-government response, the U.S. has made significant progress in its fight against the pandemic since the President took office less than 5 months ago. Already, 63% of adult Americans have gotten vaccinated, including 73% of Americans age 40 and over, and COVID-19 cases and deaths have plummeted as a result – cases are down over 90% and deaths are down over 85% since January 20<sup>th</sup>.</p>



<p>Twelve states have already given at least one shot to 70% of adults and more than 28 states and D.C. have fully vaccinated 50% or more of their adult populations, but millions of Americans still need protection against the virus.<br><br><strong>The National Month of Action will include the following initiatives:</strong><br><br><strong>MAKING IT EASIER TO GET VACCINATED AND ADVANCING EQUITY</strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>Free child care for individuals getting vaccinated: </strong>Four of the nation’s largest child care providers will offer free child care to all parents and caregivers getting vaccinated or recovering from vaccination from now until July 4<sup>th</sup>. KinderCare and Learning Care Group locations across the country will offer free, drop-in appointments to any parent or caregiver who needs support to get vaccinated or recover from vaccination, and more than 500 YMCAs in nearly every state will offer drop-in care during vaccination appointments. Bright Horizons will also provide free child care to support the vaccination of over 10 million workers employed at participating organizations. The vaccine is free for everyone, however, many unvaccinated Americans report concern about the potential ripple expenses of getting vaccinated, such as having to pay for child care.<br><br>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is also issuing new guidance that encourages states to use child care funding from the American Rescue Plan to provide financial incentives to neighborhood- and home-based child care providers who join the President’s call to action and support their communities in getting vaccinated. Visit <a href="http://www.vaccines.gov/incentives.html">Vaccines.gov/incentives</a>.html to learn more.<br> </li><li><strong>Extended hours at pharmacies across the country in June to offer more flexible appointment availability: </strong>Starting next week, thousands of pharmacies nationwide will stay open late every Friday in June, and offer services throughout the night to make sure Americans can get their shot. These extended hours will ensure that those with less flexible work hours have the opportunity to get vaccinated at times convenient to them. Participating pharmacy chains include Albertsons, CVS, Rite-Aid, and Walgreens.</li></ul>



<p><strong>MOBILIZING THE COUNTRY TO DO MORE VACCINATION EDUCATION AND OUTREACH:</strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>Community Canvassing, Phone Banking, Text Banking, and Vaccination Events:</strong> The Administration’s organizing efforts will focus on what we know works best to ensure everyone has equitable vaccine access: person-to-person action that connects people with key resources and information like Vaccines.gov, text 4-3-8-8-2-9, the National COVID-19 Vaccination Hotline (1-800-232-0233), and more. The Month of Action will include calls and texts to people in areas with low vaccination rates and canvasses in neighborhoods close to walk-in clinics where people can get vaccinated on the spot. More than 100 organizations have already committed to host over 1,000 events the first weekend alone, with thousands of additional events to take place over the course of the month. The President will call on Americans to take at least five actions to help their communities during the Month of Action, and some volunteers may be invited to visit the White House in July. Americans can visit <a href="http://wecandothis.hhs.gov/">WeCanDoThis.hhs.gov</a> to learn more and sign up to help their communities get vaccinated.<br> </li><li><strong>“We Can Do This” National Vaccination Tour:</strong> The President will announce the Vice President will lead a nation-wide tour to reach millions of Americans who still need protection against the virus, to highlight the ease of getting vaccinated, encourage vaccinations, and energize and mobilize grassroots vaccine education and outreach efforts. The Vice President’s travel will be anchored in the South, and the First Lady, the Second Gentleman, and members of the Cabinet will also join the Administration’s tour to communities across the country. </li><li><strong>Mayors Challenge to Increase Vaccination Rates in Cities Across America:</strong> Mayors across the country are stepping up to help in this effort by launching the “Mayors Challenge,” a competition to see which city can grow its vaccination rate the most by July 4<sup>th</sup>. Participating mayors commit to taking actions throughout the month to boost vaccinations, such as coordinated canvassing efforts, partnerships with local businesses, and incentives for local residents. The Administration has created a toolkit for mayors and local leaders, and will help recognize the winning cities later this year. More than 50 mayors of cities in Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, New Mexico, Ohio, Oregon, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Washington, and Wisconsin, and, as well as D.C., have already signed up the challenge, which is being run in collaboration with the <a href="http://www.usmayors.org/vaccination-challenge">U.S. Conference of Mayors</a>.<br> </li><li><strong>Shots at the Shop – A New Initiative to Engage Black-Owned Barbershops and Beauty Salons:</strong> The President will announce the Administration is teaming up with the Black Coalition Against COVID, the University of Maryland Center for Health Equity, and SheaMoisture to launch “Shots at the Shop,” an initiative that will engage Black-owned barbershops and beauty salons across the country to support local vaccine education and outreach efforts. Throughout the month of June, each participating shop will engage customers with information about the vaccines, display educational materials, and host on-site vaccination events in partnership with local providers. The “Shots at the Shop” initiative will invite participation from across the country, with a particular focus on supporting shops in some of the hardest-hit localities still experiencing significant gaps in vaccination rates.<br> </li><li><strong>Blanketing Local TV and Radio and Social Media to Get Americans the Facts and Answer Their Questions:</strong> The National Association of Broadcasters (NAB), representing more than 7,000 TV and radio stations across the country, will have local station members participate in the National Month of Action. NAB members will be airing vaccine education segments in their programming featuring trusted voices from the community, as well as medical professionals from leading medical associations across the country, including the American Medical Association, American Academy of Family Physicians, American Academy of Pediatrics, American College of Physicians, American Hospital Association, American Association of Nurse Practitioners, and Primary Care Collaborative. Medical experts will have the opportunity to share information on benefits of vaccination, address questions and concerns, and publicize where individuals in the community can get vaccinated. And, the Administration will continue deploying medical experts, public health leaders, and Cabinet officials through a whole-of-government approach to communicate directly with Americans, including by working with social media platforms and engaging celebrities and influencers to reach people where they are.<br> </li><li><strong>COVID-19 College Challenge:</strong> The Administration is launching the COVID-19 College Challenge, where colleges and universities can take a pledge and commit to taking action to get their students and communities vaccinated by going to <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/COVIDCollegeChallenge">WhiteHouse.gov/COVIDCollegeChallenge</a> and signing up. As part of the challenge, the Administration will provide resources like training sessions, toolkits, and educational material to assist colleges and universities in vaccination efforts; facilitate on-site vaccinations at schools; and launch a student corps within the COVID-19 Community Corps to recognize and activate students across the country who are taking extraordinary efforts to draw young people out to get vaccinated and engage the youth community. More than 200 colleges in 43 states have already taken the pledge and committed to the COVID-19 College Challenge. This challenge builds on the Administration’s work to facilitate partnerships between more than 60 community colleges and pharmacies in the Federal Retail Pharmacy Program to provide pop-up vaccination clinics at high-enrollment community colleges between now and July 4<sup>th</sup>.</li></ul>



<p><strong>INCENTIVIZING VACCINATION</strong><br><br><strong>Business Incentives for Vaccinated Americans:</strong>&nbsp;Thousands of employers and businesses have already stepped up to support vaccination efforts, including by offering incentives for vaccinations and providing their workers paid-leave for vaccinations. During the Month of Action, the Administration will continue working with employers to make it even easier to set up workplace vaccination clinics, and call on more businesses to encourage and incentivize vaccinations.<br><br>Starting today, Americans will be able to find a list of these and other incentives on&nbsp;<a href="http://www.vaccines.gov/incentives.html">Vaccines.gov/incentives.html</a>. Examples of new private sector actions and incentives that recently launched include:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Anheuser-Busch</strong> will give away free beer to all adults over the age of 21 in America on July 4<sup>th</sup> to celebrate the country’s progress against COVID.<br> </li><li><strong>CVS </strong>launched a sweepstakes for vaccinated people to win free cruises, tickets to Super Bowl LVI, and cash prizes.<br> </li><li><strong>Door Dash</strong> will give $2 million in gift cards to the National Association of Community Health Centers to incentivize vaccinations.<br> </li><li><strong>Major League Baseball </strong>teams will offer on-site vaccinations at games and give free tickets to those who get vaccinated.<br> </li><li><strong>Microsoft</strong> will give away thousands of Xboxes to Boys and Girls Clubs in hard-hit areas who will run promotions and educational seminars about the importance of vaccinations in hard-hit and hard-to-reach communities.<br> </li><li><strong>Kroger </strong>launched a “Community Immunity” program to give $1 million to a vaccinated person every week in June and give dozens of vaccinated Americans free groceries for a year.<br> </li><li><strong>United Airlines</strong> launched the “Your Shot to Fly” Sweepstakes for Mileage Plus members to win a year of free flights or a roundtrip for two in any class of service.</li></ul>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Greenwood Cultural Center<br>Tulsa, Oklahoma</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">(June 1, 2021)</p>



<p>3:15 P.M. CDT<br>&nbsp;<br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Well, thank you.&nbsp; Please, if you have a seat, sit down.&nbsp; And I got to make one check here.<br>&nbsp;<br>(The President leaves the podium to greet audience members.)<br>&nbsp;<br>(The President returns to the podium.)<br>&nbsp;<br>I just had to make sure the two girls got ice cream when this is over.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Imagine how excited you’d be when you’re &#8212; four?&nbsp; Five?<br>&nbsp;<br>AUDIENCE MEMBER:&nbsp; Almost five.<br>&nbsp;<br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Almost five years old, coming to hear a President speak.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; My Lord.&nbsp; In my faith, we call that purgatory.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Lauren, thank you for that gracious introduction.&nbsp; And in case you were wondering, I &#8212; in Delaware &#8212; we’re a small state &#8212; we have the eighth-largest Black population in America, and we have one of the most talented members of Congress.&nbsp; And so if I didn’t walk around and pay my tribute to Lisa Blunt Rochester my congresswoman &#8212; (applause) &#8212; immediately, that was &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>How are you, Rev?&nbsp; Good to see you.<br>&nbsp;<br>We’ve got a distinguished group of people here, and I want to thank Lauren for sharing the powerful story and for helping the country understand what’s happening here.<br>&nbsp;<br>And to all of the descendants here today, and to the community and civil rights leaders, and members of the Congressional Black Caucus that are here: Thank you for making sure we all remember and we never forget.<br>&nbsp;<br>You know, there’s a verse in First Corinthians that says, “For now, we see in a mirror dimly, but then, face to face, now I know in part, then I shall know fully.”<br>&nbsp;<br>It is &#8212; I just toured the Hall of Survivors here in Greenwood Cultural Center, and I want to thank the incredible staff for hosting us here.&nbsp; And &#8212; (applause) &#8212; I mean that sincerely.&nbsp; Thank you.<br>&nbsp;<br>And if I didn’t say what my father would insist on, please excuse my back.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; I apologize.<br>&nbsp;<br>But the tour &#8212; in the tour, I met Mother Randle, who’s only 56 [107] years old.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; God love her.&nbsp; And Mother Fletcher, who’s 67 [106] years old.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; And her brother &#8212; her brother, Van Ellis, who’s 100 years old.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; And he looks like he’s 60.&nbsp; Thank you for spending so much time with me.&nbsp; I really mean it.&nbsp; It was a great honor.&nbsp; A genuine honor.<br>&nbsp;<br>You are the three known remaining survivors of a story seen in the mirror dimly.&nbsp; But no longer.&nbsp; Now your story will be known in full view.<br>&nbsp;<br>The events we speak of today took place 100 years ago.&nbsp; And yet, I’m the first President in 100 years ever to come to Tulsa &#8212; (applause)&nbsp;&#8212; I say that not as a compliment about me, but to think about it &#8212; a hundred years, and the first President to be here during that entire time, and in this place, in this ground, to acknowledge the truth of what took place here.<br>&nbsp;<br>For much too long, the history of what took place here was told in silence, cloaked in darkness.&nbsp; But just because history is silent, it doesn’t mean that it did not take place.&nbsp; And while darkness can hide much, it erases nothing.&nbsp; It erases nothing.&nbsp; Some injustices are so heinous, so horrific, so grievous they can’t be buried, no matter how hard people try.<br>&nbsp;<br>And so it is here.&nbsp; Only &#8212; only with truth can come healing and justice and repair.&nbsp; Only with truth, facing it.&nbsp; But that isn’t enough.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>First, we have to see, hear, and give respect to Mother Randle, Mother Fletcher, and Mr. Van Ellis.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; To all those lost so many years ago, to all the descendants of those who suffered, to this community &#8212; that’s why we’re here: to shine a light, to make sure America knows the story in full.<br>&nbsp;<br>May 1921: Formerly enslaved Black people and their descendants are here in Tulsa &#8212; a boom town of oil and opportunity in a new frontier.<br>&nbsp;<br>On the north side, across the rail tracks that divided the city already segregated by law, they built something of their own, worthy &#8212; worthy of their talent and their ambition: Greenwood &#8212; a community, a way of life.&nbsp; Black doctors and lawyers, pastors, teachers; running hospitals, law practices, libraries, churches, schools.<br>&nbsp;<br>Black veterans, like a man I had the privilege to giving a Command Coin to, who fought &#8212; volunteered and fought, and came home and still faced such prejudice. &nbsp;(Applause.) &nbsp;Veterans had been back a few years helping after winning the first World War, building a new life back home with pride and confidence, who were a mom-and &#8212; they were, at the time &#8212; mom-and-plack [sic] &#8212; mom-and-pop Black diners, grocery stores, barber shops, tailors &#8212; the things that make up a community.<br>&nbsp;<br>At the Dreamland Theatre, a young Black couple, holding hands, falling in love.&nbsp; Friends gathered at music clubs and pool halls; at the Monroe family roller-skating rink.&nbsp; Visitors staying in hotels, like the Stradford.<br>&nbsp;<br>All around, Black pride shared by the professional class and the working class who lived together, side by side, for blocks on end.<br>&nbsp;<br>Mother Randle was just six years old &#8212; six years old &#8212; living with her grandmom.&nbsp; She said she was lucky to have a home and toys, and fortunate to live without fear.<br>&nbsp;<br>Mother Fletcher was seven years old, the second of seven children.&nbsp; The youngest, being Mr. Van Ellis, was just a few months old.&nbsp; The children of former sharecroppers, when they went to bed at night in Greenwood, Mother Fletcher says they fell asleep rich in terms of the wealth &#8212; not real wealth, but a different wealth &#8212; a wealth in culture and community and heritage.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>But one night &#8212; one night changed everything.&nbsp; Everything changed.&nbsp; While Greenwood was a community to itself, it was not separated from the outside.<br>&nbsp;<br>It wasn’t everyone, but there was enough hate, resentment, and vengeance in the community. &nbsp;Enough people who believed that America does not belong to everyone and not everyone is created equal &#8212; Native Americans, Asian Americans, Hispanic Americans, Black Americans. &nbsp;A belief enforced by law, by badge, by hood and by noose. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And it speaks to that &#8212; lit the fuse.&nbsp; It lit it by the spark that it provided &#8212; a fuse of fury &#8212; was an innocent interaction that turned into an in- &#8212; a terrible, terrible headline allegation of a Black male teenager attacking a white female teenager.<br>&nbsp;<br>A white mob of 1,000 gathered around the courthouse where the Black teenager was being held, ready to do what still occurred: lynch that young man that night.&nbsp; But 75 Black men, including Black veterans, arrived to stand guard.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Words were exchanged.&nbsp; Then a scuffle.&nbsp; Then shots fired.&nbsp; Hell was unleashed.&nbsp; Literal hell was unleashed.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Through the night and into the morning, the mob terrorized Greenwood.&nbsp; Torches and guns.&nbsp; Shooting at will.&nbsp; A mob tied a Black man by the waist to the back of their truck with his head banging along the pavement as they drove off.&nbsp; A murdered Black family draped over the fence of their home outside.&nbsp; An elderly couple, knelt by their bed, praying to God with their heart and their soul, when they were shot in the back of their heads.<br>&nbsp;<br>Private planes &#8212; private planes &#8212; dropping explosives &#8212; the first and only domestic aerial assault of its kind on an American city here in Tulsa.<br>&nbsp;<br>Eight of Greenwood’s nearly two dozen churches burned, like Mt. Zion &#8212; across the street, at Vernon AME.<br>&nbsp;<br>Mother Randle said it was like war.&nbsp; Mother Fletcher says, all these years later, she still sees Black bodies around.<br>&nbsp;<br>The Greenwood newspaper publisher A.J. Smitherton [sic] &#8212; excuse me &#8212; Smitherman penned a poem of what he heard and felt that night.&nbsp; And here&#8217;s the poem.&nbsp; He said, “Kill them, burn them, set the pace… teach them how to keep their place.&nbsp; Reign of murder, theft, and plunder was the order of the night.”&nbsp; That&#8217;s what he remembered in the poem that he wrote.<br>&nbsp;<br>One hundred years ago at this hour, on this first day of June, smoke darkened the Tulsa sky, rising from 35 blocks of Greenwood that were left in ash and ember, razed and in rubble.<br>&nbsp;<br>Less than 24 hours &#8212; in less than 24 hours, 1,100 Black homes and businesses were lost.&nbsp; Insurance companies &#8212; they had insurance, many of them &#8212; rejected claims of damage.&nbsp; Ten thousand people were left destitute and homeless, placed in internment camps.<br>&nbsp;<br>As I was told today, they were told, &#8220;Don’t you mention you were ever in a camp or we&#8217;ll come and get you.&#8221;&nbsp; That&#8217;s what survivors told me.<br>&nbsp;<br>Yet no one &#8212; no arrests of the mob were made.&nbsp; None.&nbsp; No proper accounting of the dead.&nbsp; The death toll records by local officials said there were 36 people.&nbsp; That&#8217;s all.&nbsp; Thirty-six people.<br>&nbsp;<br>But based on studies, records, and accounts, the likelihood &#8212; the likely number is much more, in the multiple of hundreds. Untold bodies dumped into mass graves.&nbsp; Families who, at the time, waited for hours and days to know the fate of their loved ones are now descendants who have gone 100 years without closure.<br>&nbsp;<br>But, you know, as we speak, the process &#8212; the process of exhuming the unmarked graves has started.&nbsp; And at this moment, I’d like to pause for a moment of silence for the fathers, the mothers, the sisters, sons, and daughters, friends of God and Greenwood.&nbsp; They deserve dignity, and they deserve our respect.&nbsp; May their souls rest in peace.<br>&nbsp;<br>[Pause for a moment of silence.]<br>&nbsp;<br>My fellow Americans, this was not a riot.&nbsp; This was a massacre &#8212; (applause) &#8212; among the worst in our history, but not the only one.&nbsp; And for too long, forgotten by our history.<br>&nbsp;<br>As soon as it happened, there was a clear effort to erase it from our memory &#8212; our collective memories &#8212; from the news and everyday conversations.&nbsp; For a long time, schools in Tulsa didn’t even teach it, let alone schools elsewhere.<br>&nbsp;<br>And most people didn’t realize that, a century ago, a second Ku Klux Klan had been founded &#8212; the second Ku Klux Klan had been founded.<br>&nbsp;<br>A friend of mine, Jon Meacham &#8212; I had written &#8212; when I said I was running to restore the soul of America, he wrote a book called &#8220;The Soul of America&#8221; &#8212; not because of what I said.&nbsp; And there&#8217;s a picture about page 160 in his book, showing over 30,000 Ku Klux Klan members in full regalia, Reverend &#8212; pointed hats, the robes &#8212; marching down Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, D.C.&nbsp; Jesse, you know all about this.&nbsp; Washin- &#8212; Washington, D.C.<br>&nbsp;<br>If my memory is correct, there were 37 members of the House of Representatives who were open members of the Klan.&nbsp; There were five, if I&#8217;m not mistaken &#8212; it could have been seven; I think it was five &#8212; members of the United States Senate &#8212; open members of the Klan.&nbsp; Multiple governors who were open members of the Klan.<br>&nbsp;<br>Most people didn&#8217;t realize that, a century ago, the Klan was founded just six years before the horrific destruction here in Tulsa.&nbsp; And one of the reasons why it was founded was because of guys like me, who were Catholic.&nbsp; It wasn&#8217;t about African Americans, then; it was about making sure that all those Polish and Irish and Italian and Eastern European Catholics who came to the United States after World War One would not pollute Christianity.<br>&nbsp;<br>The flames from those burning crosses torched every region &#8212; region of the country.&nbsp; Millions of white Americans belonged to the Klan, and they weren’t even embarrassed by it; they were proud of it.<br>&nbsp;<br>And that hate became embedded systematically and systemically in our laws and our culture.&nbsp; We do ourselves no favors by pretending none of this ever happened or that it doesn’t impact us today, because it does still impact us today.<br>&nbsp;<br>We can’t just choose to learn what we want to know and not what we should know.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; We should know the good, the bad, everything.&nbsp; That’s what great nations do: They come to terms with their dark sides.&nbsp; And we’re a great nation.<br>&nbsp;<br>The only way to build a common ground is to truly repair and to rebuild.&nbsp; I come here to help fill the silence, because in silence, wounds deepen.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; And only &#8212; as painful as it is, only in remembrance do wounds heal.&nbsp; We just have to choose to remember.<br>&nbsp;<br>We memorialize what happened here in Tulsa so it can be &#8211;so it can&#8217;t be erased.&nbsp; We know here, in this hallowed place, we simply can’t bury pain and trauma forever.<br>&nbsp;<br>And at some point, there will be a reckoning, an inflection point, like we’re facing right now as a nation.<br>&nbsp;<br>What many people hadn’t seen before or ha- &#8212; or simply refused to see cannot be ignored any longer.&nbsp; You see it in so many places.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And there’s greater recognition that, for too long, we’ve allowed a narrowed, cramped view of the promise of this nation to fester &#8212; the view that America is a zero-sum game where there is only one winner.&nbsp; “If you succeed, I fail.&nbsp; If you get ahead, I fall behind.&nbsp; If you get a job, I lose mine.”&nbsp;&nbsp; And maybe worst of all, “If I hold you down, I lift myself up,” instead of “If you do well, we all do well.”&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; We see that in Greenwood.<br>&nbsp;<br>This story isn’t about the loss of life, but a loss of living, of wealth and prosterity [prosperity] and possibilities that still reverberates today.<br>&nbsp;<br>Mother Fletcher talks about how she was only able to attend school until the fourth grade and eventually found work in the shipyards, as a domestic worker.<br>&nbsp;<br>Mr. Van Ellis has shared how, even after enlisting and serving in World War Two, he still came home to struggle with a segregated America.<br>&nbsp;<br>Imagine all those hotels and dinners [diners] and mom-and-pop shops that could been &#8212; have been passed down this past hundred years. &nbsp;Imagine what could have been done for Black families in Greenwood: financial security and generational wealth.<br>&nbsp;<br>If you come from backgrounds like my &#8212; my family &#8212; a working-class, middle-class family &#8212; the only way we were ever able to generate any wealth was in equity in our homes.&nbsp; Imagine what they contributed then and what they could’ve contributed all these years.&nbsp; Imagine a thriving Greenwood in North Tulsa for the last hundred years, what that would’ve meant for all of Tulsa, including the white community.<br>&nbsp;<br>While the people of Greenwood rebuilt again in the years after the massacre, it didn’t last.&nbsp; Eventually neighborhoods were redlined on maps, locking Black Tulsa out of homeownerships.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; A highway was built right through the heart of the community.&nbsp; Lisa, I was talking about our west side &#8212; what 95 did to it after we were occupied by the military, after Dr. King was murdered.&nbsp; The community &#8212; cutting off Black families and businesses from jobs and opportunity. &nbsp;Chronic underinvestment from state and federal governments denied Greenwood even just a chance at rebuilding.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br>&nbsp;<br>We must find the courage to change the things we know we can change.&nbsp; That’s what Vice President Harris and I are focused on, along with our entire administration, including our Housing and Urban Development Secretary, Marcia Fudge, who is here today.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br>&nbsp;<br>Because today, we’re announcing two expanded efforts targeted toward Black wealth creation that will also help the entire community.&nbsp; The first is: My administration has launched an aggressive effort to combat racial discrimination in housing.&nbsp; That includes everything from redlining to the cruel fact that a home owned by a Black family is too often appraised at a lower value than a similar home owned by a white family.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br>&nbsp;<br>And I might add &#8212; and I need help if you have an answer to this; I can&#8217;t figure this one out, Congressman Horsford.&nbsp; But if you live in a Black community and there&#8217;s another one on the other side of the highway &#8212; it’s a white community; it’s the &#8212; built by the same builder, and you have a better driving record than they guy with the same car in the white community, you&#8217;re &#8212; can pay more for your auto insurance.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Shockingly, the percentage of Black American homeownership is lower today in America than when the Fair Housing Act was passed more than 50 years ago.&nbsp; Lower today.&nbsp; That’s wrong.&nbsp; And we’re committing to changing that.<br>&nbsp;<br>Just imagine if instead of denying millions of Americans<br>the ability to own their own home and build generational wealth, we made it possible for them to buy a home and build equity into that &#8212; into that home and provide for their families.<br>&nbsp;<br>Second, small businesses are the engines of our economy and the glue of our communities.&nbsp; As President, my administration oversees hundreds of billions of dollars in federal contracts for everything from refurbishing decks of aircraft carriers, to installing railings in federal buildings, to professional services.<br>&nbsp;<br>We have a thing called &#8212; I won’t go into it all because there&#8217;s not enough time now.&nbsp; But I&#8217;m determined to use every taxpayer’s dollar that is assigned to me to spend, going to American companies and American workers to build Ameri&#8211; to build American products.&nbsp;&nbsp; And as part of that, I&#8217;m going to increase the share of the dollars the federal government spends to small, disadvantaged businesses, including Black and brown small businesses.<br>&nbsp;<br>Right now, it calls for 10 percent; I’m going to move that to 15 percent of every dollar spent will be spent (inaudible).&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; I have the authority to do that.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Just imagine if, instead of denying millions of entrepreneurs the ability to access capital and contracting, we made it possible to take their dreams to the marketplace to create jobs and invest in our communities.<br>&nbsp;<br>That &#8212; the data shows young Black entrepreneurs are just as capable of succeeding, given the chance, as white entrepreneurs are.&nbsp; But they don’t have lawyers.&nbsp; They don’t have &#8212; they &#8212; they don’t have accountants, but they have great ideas.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Does anyone doubt this whole nation would be better off from the investments those people make?&nbsp; And I promise you, that’s why I set up the &#8212; a national Small Business Administration that’s much broader.&nbsp; Because they&#8217;re going to get those loans.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Instead of consigning millions of American children to under-resourced schools, let’s give each and every child, three and four years old, access to school &#8212; not daycare, school.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br>&nbsp;<br>In the last 10 years, studies have been done by all the great universities.&nbsp; It shows that, if increased by 56 percent, the possibility of a child &#8212; no matter what background they come from; no matter what &#8212; if they start school at three years old, they have a 56 percent chance of going all through all 12 years without any trouble and being able to do well, and a chance to learn and grow and thrive in a school and throughout their lives.<br>&nbsp;<br>And let’s unlock more than &#8212; an incredible creativity and innovation that will come from the nation’s Historically Black Colleges and Universities.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; I have a $5 billion program giving them the resources to invest in research centers and laboratories and high-demand fields to compete for the good-paying jobs in industries like &#8212; of the future, like cybersecurity.<br>&nbsp;<br>The reason why they don’t &#8212; their &#8212; their students are equally able to learn as well, and get the good-paying job that start at 90- and 100,000 bucks.&nbsp; But they don’t have &#8212; they don’t have the back &#8212; they don’t have the money to provide and build those laboratories.&nbsp; So, guess what?&nbsp; They’re going to get the money to build those laboratories.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So, instead of just talking about infrastructure, let’s get about the &#8212; about the business of actually rebuilding roads and highways, filling the sidewalks and cracks, installing streetlights and high-speed Internet, creating space &#8212; space to live and work and play safely.<br>&nbsp;<br>Let’s ensure access to healthcare, clean water, clean air, nearby grocery stores &#8212; stock the fresh vegetables and food that &#8212; (applause) &#8212; in fact, deal with &#8212; I mean, these are all things we can do.<br>&nbsp;<br>Does anyone doubt this whole nation would be better off with these investments?&nbsp; The rich will be just as well off.&nbsp; The middle class will do better, and everybody will do better.&nbsp; It’s about good-paying jobs, financial stability, and being able to build some generational wealth.&nbsp; It’s about economic growth for our country and outcompeting the rest of the world, which is now outcompeting us.<br>&nbsp;<br>But just as fundamental as any of these investments I’ve discussed &#8212; this may be the most fundamental: the right to vote.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; The right to vote.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br>&nbsp;<br>A lot of the members of the Black Caucus knew John Lewis better than I did, but I knew him.&nbsp; On his deathbed, like many, I called John, to speak to him.&nbsp; But all John wanted to do was talk about how I was doing.&nbsp; He died, I think, about 25 hours later.&nbsp;<br>But you know what John said?&nbsp; He called the right to vote “precious,” “almost sacred.”&nbsp; He said, “The most powerful nonviolent tool we have in a democratic society”.<br>&nbsp;<br>This sacred right is under assault with an incredible intensity like I’ve never seen &#8212; even though I got started as a public defender and a civil rights lawyer &#8212; with an intensity and an aggressiveness that we have not seen in a long, long time.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>It’s simply un-American.&nbsp; It is not, however, sadly, unprecedented.&nbsp; The creed “We Shall Overcome” is a longtime mainstay of the Civil Rights Movement, as Jesse Jackson can tell you better than anybody.<br>&nbsp;<br>The obstacle to proc- &#8212; to progress that have to be overcome are a constant challenge.&nbsp; We saw it in the ‘60s, but with the current assault, it’s not just an echo of a distant history.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>In 2020, we faced a tireless assault on the right to vote: restrictive laws, lawsuits, threats of intimidation, voter purges, and more.&nbsp; We resolved to overcome it all, and we did.&nbsp; More Americans voted in the last election than any &#8212; in the midst of a pandemic &#8212; than any election in American history.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>You got voters registered.&nbsp; You got voters to the polls.&nbsp; The rule of law held.&nbsp; Democracy prevailed.&nbsp; We overcame.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>But today, let me be unequivocal: I&#8217;ve been engaged in this work my whole career, and we&#8217;re going to be ramping up our efforts to overcome again.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>I will have more to say about this at a later date &#8212; the truly unprecedented assault on our democracy, an effort to replace nonpartisan election administrators and to intimidate those charged with tallying and reporting the election results.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>But today, as for the act of voting itself, I urge voting rights groups in this country to begin to redouble their efforts now to register and educate voters.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And in June &#8212; June should be a month of action on Capitol Hill.&nbsp; I hear all the folks on TV saying, “Why doesn&#8217;t Biden get this done?”&nbsp; Well, because Biden only has a majority of, effectively, four votes in the House and a tie in the Senate, with two members of the Senate who vote more with my Republican friends.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>But we’re not giving up.&nbsp; Earlier this year, the House of Representatives passed For the People Act to protect our democracy.&nbsp; The Senate will take it up later this month, and I&#8217;m going to fight like heck with every tool at my disposal for its passage.<br>&nbsp;<br>The House is also working on the John Lewis Voting Rights Act, which is &#8212; which is critical &#8212; (applause) &#8212; to providing new legal tools to combat the new assault on the right to vote.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>To signify the importance of our efforts, today I&#8217;m asking Vice President Harris to help these efforts and lead them, among her many other responsibilities.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>With her leadership and your support, we&#8217;re going to overcome again, I promise you.&nbsp; But it&#8217;s going to take a hell of a lot of work.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br>&nbsp;<br>And finally, we have to &#8212; and finally, we must address what remains the stain on the soul of America.&nbsp; What happened in Greenwood was an act of hate and domestic terrorism with a through line that exists today still.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Just close your eyes and remember what you saw in Charlottesville four years ago on television.&nbsp; Neo-Nazis, white supremacists, the KKK coming out of those fields at night in Virginia with lighted torches &#8212; the veins bulging on their &#8212; as they were screaming.&nbsp; Remember?&nbsp; Just close your eyes and picture what it was.<br>&nbsp;<br>Well, Mother Fletcher said when she saw the insurrection at the Capitol on January the 9th [6th], it broke her heart &#8212; a mob of violent white extremists &#8212; thugs. &nbsp;Said it reminded her what happened here in Greenwood 100 years ago.<br>&nbsp;<br>Look around at the various hate crimes against Asian Americans and Jewish Americans.&nbsp; Hate that never goes away.&nbsp; Hate only hides.<br>&nbsp;<br>Jesse, I think I mentioned this to you.&nbsp; I thought, after you guys pushed through, with Dr. King, the Voting Rights Act and the Civil Rights Act &#8212; I thought we moved.&nbsp; But what I didn&#8217;t realize &#8212; I thought we had made enormous progress, and I was so proud to be a little part of it.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>But you know what, Rev?&nbsp; I didn’t realize hate is never defeated; it only hides.&nbsp; It hides.&nbsp; And given a little bit of oxygen &#8212; just a little bit oxygen &#8212; by its leaders, it comes out of there from under the rock like it was happening again, as if it never went away.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And so, folks, we can’t &#8212; we must not give hate a safe harbor.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>As I said in my address to the joint session of Congress: According to the intelligence community, terrorism from white supremacy is the most lethal threat to the homeland today.&nbsp; Not ISIS, not al Qaeda &#8212; white supremacists.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; That’s not me; that’s the intelligence community under both Trump and under my administration.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Two weeks ago, I signed into law the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act, which the House had passed and the Senate.&nbsp; My administration will soon lay out our broader strategy to counter domestic terrorism and the violence driven by the most heinous hate crimes and other forms of vigorty [sic] &#8212; of bigotry.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>But I&#8217;m going to close where I started.&nbsp; To Mother Randle, Mother Fletcher, Mr. Van Ellis, to the descendants, and to all survivors: Thank you.&nbsp; Thank you for giving me the honor of being able to spend some time with you earlier today.&nbsp; Thank you for your courage.&nbsp; Thank you for your commitment. &nbsp;And thank your children, and your grandchildren, and your unc- &#8212; and your nieces and your nephews.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>To see and learn from you is a gift &#8212; a genuine gift.&nbsp; Dr. John Hope Franklin, one of America&#8217;s greatest historians &#8212; Tulsa’s proud son, whose father was a Greenwood survivor &#8212; said, and I quote, “Whatever you do, it must be done in the spirit of goodwill and mutual respect and even love.&nbsp; How else can we overcome the past and be worthy of our forebearers and face the future with confidence and with hope?”<br>&nbsp;<br>On this sacred and solemn day, may we find that distinctly Greenwood spirit that defines the American spirit &#8212; the spirit that gives me so much confidence and hope for the future; that helps us see, face to face; a spirit that helps us know fully who we are and who we can be as a people and as a nation.<br>&nbsp;<br>I’ve never been more optimistic about the future than I am today.&nbsp; I mean that.&nbsp; And the reason is because of this new generation of young people.&nbsp; They&#8217;re the best educated, they’re the least prejudiced, the most open generation in American history.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And although I have no scientific basis of what I’m about to say, but those of you who are over 50 &#8212; how often did you ever see &#8212; how often did you ever see advertisements on television with Black and white couples?&nbsp; Not a joke.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>I challenge you &#8212; find today, when you turn on the stations &#8212; sit on one station for two hours.&nbsp; And I don’t know how many commercials you’ll see &#8212; eight to five &#8212; two to three out of five have mixed-race couples in them.&nbsp; That’s not by accident.&nbsp; They’re selling soap, man.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Not a joke.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Remember ol&#8217; Pat Caddell?&nbsp; He used to say, “You want to know what’s happening in American culture?&nbsp; Watch advertising, because they want to sell what they have.&#8221;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>We have hope in folks like you, honey.&nbsp; I really mean it.&nbsp; We have hope.&nbsp; But we&#8217;ve got to give them support.&nbsp; We have got to give them the backbone to do what we know has to be done.&nbsp; Because I doubt whether any of you would be here if you didn&#8217;t care deeply about this.&nbsp; You sure in the devil didn&#8217;t come to hear me speak.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>But I really mean it.&nbsp; I really mean it.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s not give up, man.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s not give up.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>As the old saying goes, “Hope springs eternal.”&nbsp; I know we&#8217;ve talked a lot about famous people, but I’m &#8212; my colleagues in the Senate used to kid me because I was always quoting Irish poets.&nbsp; They think I did it because I&#8217;m Irish.&nbsp; They think I did it because we Irish &#8212; we have a little chip on our shoulder.&nbsp; A little bit, sometimes.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>That&#8217;s not why I did it; I did it because they&#8217;re the best poets in the world.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; You can smile, it’s okay.&nbsp; It’s true.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>There was a famous poet who wrote a poem called “The Cure at Troy” &#8212; Seamus Heaney.&nbsp; And there is a stanza in it that I think is the definition of what I think should be our call today for young people.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>It said, “History teaches us not to hope on this side of the grave, but then, once in a lifetime, the longed-for tidal wave of justice rises up, and hope and history rhyme.”&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Let&#8217;s make it rhyme.&nbsp; Thank you.<br>&nbsp;<br>3:54 P.M. CDT</p>

<p>Every American has a right to have their voice heard at the ballot box, and no American should be kept from voting early, voting by mail, or voting at all. Our democracy is strongest when everyone participates, and it is weaker when people are left out.<br><br>Throughout the arc of our nation’s history, many have worked—and many have died—to ensure that all Americans can cast a ballot and have their vote counted. Today, that hard-won progress is under assault.<br><br>In the last election, more people voted than ever before. Since then, more than 380 bills have been introduced across the country that would make it harder for Americans to vote. These bills seek to restrict the options that make voting more convenient and accessible, including early voting and vote by mail. Our Administration will not stand by when confronted with any effort that keeps Americans from voting. <br><br>We must protect the fundamental right to vote for all Americans regardless of where they live. There are two important bills in Congress that would do just that. The For the People Act would provide all Americans with fair and accessible voting options, and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act would prevent discriminatory changes to voting laws and procedures. <br><br>President Joe Biden asked me to help lead our Administration’s effort to protect the fundamental right to vote for all Americans. In the days and weeks ahead, I will engage the American people, and I will work with voting rights organizations, community organizations, and the private sector to help strengthen and uplift efforts on voting rights nationwide. And we will also work with members of Congress to help advance these bills.<br><br>The work ahead of us is to make voting accessible to all American voters, and to make sure every vote is counted through a free, fair, and transparent process. This is the work of democracy.</p>

<p>12:42 P.M. EDT<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; All right.&nbsp; Got a few things for you all at the top.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Today in Tulsa, the President will tour the Greenwood Cultural Center, meet with surviving members of the community, and deliver remarks to commemorate the Tulsa Race Massacre.<br>&nbsp;<br>One hundred years ago, the thriving Black community of Greenwood in Tulsa, Oklahoma, was ruthlessly attacked by a violent, white supremacist mob.&nbsp; An estimated 300 Black Americans were killed, and another 10,000 were left destitute and homeless.<br>&nbsp;<br>The President is honored to have the opportunity to listen to them and learn from the survivors of the community.&nbsp; He plans to convey his heartfelt gratitude for their bravery in sharing the stories of the trauma and violence that was wrought on them and their families.&nbsp; And &#8212; and frankly, he plans to discuss his shared sense of frustration and pain that justice has been denied to these families for so long.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>As the President will explain in his remarks, he is traveling to Tulsa to shine a light on what happened and to make sure America knows the story in full.&nbsp; He will explain that we need to know our history &#8212; from the original sin of slavery, through the Tulsa Race Massacre, to racial discrimination in housing &#8212; in order to build common ground to truly repair and rebuild.<br>&nbsp;<br>This morning, on the centennial of that massacre, the Biden-Harris administration announced new steps to help narrow the racial wealth gap and reinvest in communities that have been left behind by failed policies.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The administration is expanding access to two key wealth creators &#8212; homeownership and small business ownership &#8212; in communities of color and disadvantaged communities by launching a first-of-its-kind inter- &#8212; interagency effort to address inequity and racial bias in home appraisals and conducting rulemaking to aggressively combat housing discrimination; using the federal government&#8217;s purchasing power to grow federal contracting with small business &#8212; small, disadvantaged businesses by 50 percent, translating to an additional $100 billion over five years.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>This builds on the President&#8217;s historic approach to advancing equity and racial justice across the whole of federal government.<br>&nbsp;<br>On day one, the President signed an executive order directing federal agencies to identify concrete opportunities to advance equitable outcomes &#8212; which has already led to the Department of Agriculture announcing a new $6 billion initiative to help small and socially disadvantaged producers; the Department of Transportation imposing an unprecedented pause on a highway project in Texas to review civil rights and enviro- &#8212; environmental justice concerns.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The President has proposed historic plans &#8212; the American Rescue Plan, the American Jobs Plan, the American Families Plan &#8212; that will make generational investments in racial justice and support underserved communities like Tulsa, who face challenging economic conditions resulting from histories of discrimination and disinvestment.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>One more thing, as soon as I get there.&nbsp; One more update for &#8212; for all of you.&nbsp; Meat producer JBS notified us on Sunday that they are the victims of a ransomware attack.&nbsp; The White House has offered assistance to JBS, and our team and the Department of Agriculture have spoken to their leadership several times in the last day.&nbsp; JBS notified the administration that the ransom demand came from a criminal organization likely based in Russia.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The White House is engaging directly with the Russian government on this matter and delivering the message that responsible states do not harbor ransomware criminals.&nbsp; The FBI is investigating the incident and CISA is coordinating with the FBI to offer technical support to the company in recovering from the ransomware attack.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>USDA has reached out to several major meat processors in the United States to ensure they are aware of the situation.&nbsp; We&#8217;re assessing any impacts on supply, and the President has directed the administration to determine what we can do to mitigate any impacts as they may become necessary.<br>&nbsp;<br>Combating ransomware is a priority for the administration.&nbsp; President Biden has already launched a rapid strategic review to address the increased threat of ransomware to include four lines of effort: one, distribution of ransomware infrastructure and actors working closely with the private sector; two, building an international coalition to hold countries who harbor ransom actors accountable; expanding cryptocurrency analysis to find and pursue criminal transaction; and reviewing the USG&#8217;s ransomware policies.<br>&nbsp;<br>This builds on President Biden&#8217;s executive order, which is now being implemented.&nbsp; The executive order outlines five high-priority cybersecurity initiatives that, if implemented, will reduce the risk of cyberattacks including ransomware.<br>&nbsp;<br>We call on organizations across government and the private sector to take the threat of ransomware seriously and modernize their cyber defenses, including implementing the practices in the executive order.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>CI- &#8212; CISA has also built a toolkit to further guide organizations on addressing ransomware threats: CISA.gov/ransomware.&nbsp; That is the site that they have built.<br>&nbsp;<br>Okay.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karine, can we have you move in a little bit, just so you&#8217;re not talking in the doorway?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Yeah.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Just to make sure we&#8217;re picking this up.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I &#8212; all I heard you say was &#8220;ransomware.&#8221;&nbsp; Can you just briefly summarize what you were talking about there for us &#8212; or those of us that couldn&#8217;t hear clearly?<br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; Oh, I&#8217;m so sorry.&nbsp; I can repeat that part again.&nbsp; Do you mean about the cyberattacks in general?&nbsp; You guys didn&#8217;t hear any of it?<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All I heard was &#8220;ransomware&#8221; and I heard &#8220;agriculture&#8221; at one point.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; So, this is the JBS cyberattack, which happened &#8212; which occurred recently.&nbsp; So, one &#8212; one more &#8212; it was another update that we had for all of you.&nbsp; The meat producer J- &#8212; JBS notified us on Sunday that they are &#8212; that they are the victims of a ransomware attack.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The White House has offered assistance to J- &#8212; JBS, and our team at the Department of Agriculture have spoken to their leadership several times in the last day.<br>&nbsp;<br>JBS notified the administration that the ransom demand came from a criminal organization likely based in Russia.&nbsp; So, the White House is engaging directly with the Russian government on this matter and delivering the message that responsible states do not harbor ransomware criminals.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The FBI is investigating the incident, and CISA is coordinating with the FBI to offer technical support to the company in recovering from the ransomware attack as well.&nbsp; USD- &#8212; USDA has reached out to several major meat processors in the United States to ensure they are aware of the situation.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re assessing any impacts on supply, and the President has directed the administration to determine what we can do to mitigate any impacts as may become necessary.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And on the President&#8217;s meeting tomorrow with Senator Capito: Is it just Senator Capito, or is it Senator Capito and other Republican senators?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Yeah, it&#8217;s just with Senator Capito.&nbsp; That is the meeting that &#8212; where he&#8217;s having tomorrow.&nbsp; This is to discuss the counteroffer.<br>&nbsp;<br>As you know, the President and the Republicans in &#8212; on the Senate have been in a good-faith, healthy discussion on the American Jobs Plan &#8212; how to move forward; how do we invest in our infrastructure; building roads, bridges, and making sure that we&#8217;re creating jobs as well, which is what the President wants to do.<br>&nbsp;<br>They came back with nearly a trillion-dollar counteroffer.&nbsp; And so, the President is going to have a conversation with Senator Capito tomorrow to continue those discussions that they&#8217;ve been having the past several weeks.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Has &#8212; does the President have any reaction to what&#8217;s going on in Israel with the government there?&nbsp; Has he spoken to any of the leaders involved, like Prime Minister Netanyahu or the others who are vying for that job?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Yeah, so, Jeff, as you can imagine, we&#8217;re not going to comment publicly on government formation while that process is underway.&nbsp; So, we&#8217;re just not going to comment at this time.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just one &#8212; just one other topic, with regard to the Texas voting restrictions.&nbsp; There are calls from Democrats now for the President and for Congress to &#8212; for the U.S. Congress and congressional Democrats to do more to help stop what&#8217;s going on there.&nbsp; What&#8217;s the White House&#8217;s reaction to that?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; So, just to &#8212; just to state a couple of things here.&nbsp; The Texas legislation is part of a concerted attack on our democracy being advanced in statehouses across the country on the basis of the same repeatedly disproven lies that led to the assault on our nation&#8217;s Capitol on January 6th.<br>&nbsp;<br>This must stop.&nbsp; We need to make it easier, not harder, for all eligible voters to register and cast their ballots.&nbsp; We need to move forward, not backwards.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The fact of the matter is that the Texas &#8212; Texas legislation would make it harder to vote in a state where it is already too hard for many to vote.&nbsp; Among other restriction provisions, the bill would have restricted the ability to apply for and help others apply for voting by mail, including a provision forcing people with disabilities to identify as such; given expansion permissions to partisan watchers in a way likely to lead to interference with both voters and officials; made it harder for local election officials to open polls at times that work for voters, including on Sunday mornings and at late-night hours that accommodate shift &#8212; shift workers.<br>&nbsp;<br>The President put out a pretty &#8212; a statement over the weekend about this, about his thoughts on how &#8212; how un-American and un-democratic what we’re seeing across the country and in Texas, in particular, because that was the most recent &#8212; recent legislation that came forth.&nbsp; And so, he&#8217;ll have more to say in &#8212; in short order later today.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karine, what does it mean that the President is going to visit Tulsa, which was relatively obscure in the history books, at a time when Republican legislatures are really trying to beat back attempts to teach racist history at school?&nbsp; I&#8217;m thinking of the 1619 Project and other backlash to racist historical events.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Yeah, so on that question, Mario, the President strongly believes that the federal government has no role in setting school curriculums.&nbsp; Setting academic curriculum is the responsibility of state and local officials.&nbsp; Curricular decisions should be &#8212; shouldn&#8217;t be driven by politics, as you can imagine, but the President does believe that it is important for our nation&#8217;s students to fully understand our history.<br>&nbsp;<br>America is the greatest democracy in the world because of our founding ideals of liberty and freedom.&nbsp; Our democracy is strongest when our citizens understand the times in our history (inaudible) we have not lived up to these ideals, so that we can all strive together to form a more perfect union.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karine, does the President support reparations for the families of the victims of the Tulsa Massacre?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; So, the President believes that what these survivors have endured is tragic and devastating.&nbsp; First and foremost, he is honored to have the opportunity to listen to them and learn from their experiences.&nbsp; He also plans to convey his heartfelt gratitude for their bravery in sharing the stories of the trauma and violence that was wrought on them and their families.&nbsp; And that is &#8212; that is going to be his focus today, and that&#8217;s what he wants to do.&nbsp; He wants to hear (inaudible).<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will he specifically talk about any government effort to repay those families in this meeting with a couple of survivors, but the others who he won&#8217;t be meeting with today?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; So, look, you know, the fact that 100 years after a violent racist mob destroyed an entire neighborhood, murdered hundreds of innocent people, and burned churches to the ground, there &#8212; there are survivors of that violence who are still forced to fight for recognition should &#8212; should &#8212; should appall us all.&nbsp; And that is the focus of what the President wants to do.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>He wants to make sure that this is on record, that this is not forgotten &#8212; a story that has not been told is told.&nbsp; And, you know, it is an indictment of systemic racism that these survivors have been forced to fight for literally 100 years to have their humanity recognized and to have justice served, and justice and fairness still eludes them.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>President Biden believes we have to take core steps right now to fight systemic racism, things like fighting redlining, supporting funding for under schools &#8212; underfunded schools that are too often located in predominantly Black and brown neighborhoods, and more.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>He also supports a study, as we&#8217;ve said before, into reparations, but believes that, first and foremost, the task in front of us is not to root out &#8212; is to root out systemic racism where it exists right now.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s a &#8212; central to all of his agenda.<br>&nbsp;<br>As I mentioned in the topper, he has put equity in everything &#8212; in every plan that he&#8217;s put forward, if you think about the American Rescue Plan and how that&#8217;s going to cut down poverty by more than 50 percent &#8212; child poverty in Black communities.&nbsp; You think about the American Families Plan, the American Jobs Plan &#8212; all of those things also has equity at the middle of it.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>If you think about the COVID task force &#8212; the Racial Task Force, we actually have a COVID task force that deals with making sure we don&#8217;t leave communities behind.&nbsp; And so, that has been his focus throughout his presidency thus far.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One thing, just to follow up.&nbsp; Can I just follow up really quickly, because &#8212; on that point?&nbsp; The NAACP president says, “You can&#8217;t begin to address the racial wealth gap without addressing the student loan debt crisis.”&nbsp; So, with everything that the White House announced today ahead of this trip to Tulsa, why wasn&#8217;t cancellation of student debt a part of that?&nbsp; And is this still something the President is considering?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; So, look, the American Families Plan, which is included in the President&#8217;s budget, includes a historic $46 billion of investments in HBCUs, Tribal colleges and universities, and minority-serving institutions.&nbsp; These institutions are critical to helping underrepresented students move to the top of the income ladder.&nbsp; And so, President Biden is calling for a historic investment in affordability through subsidized tuition and expanding institutional and &#8212; grants.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>These investments will enable America&#8217;s HBCUs, TSCUs, and MSIUs to tackle long standing inequalities in post-secondary education.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secretary Buttigieg, over the weekend, talked about the week of June 7th as another important milestone in terms of the negotiations over an infrastructure package.&nbsp; Is that the moment at which, if there isn&#8217;t the kind of progress the White House has wanted to see already, the White House goes ahead and moves alone?&nbsp; The Transportation Committee &#8212; the chairman on the Democratic side has already set a markup for a different infrastructure proposal at that point.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; No, thanks &#8212; thanks for the question.&nbsp; So, look, as you just stated, you know, the President is &#8212; as I stated earlier, he is thank- &#8212; he is &#8212; he is appreciative and heartened by the good &#8212; good, you know &#8212; the good-faith effort that we&#8217;ve seen from Republican senators.&nbsp; But as the President said last week, we do need to finish these negotiations soon because we’re in a race to win the 21st century.&nbsp; And the pandemic exposed just how badly we need to invest in the foundation of this country.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee is doing a markup on infrastructure on June 9th, as well, which is a relevant date in terms of the overall timeframe.&nbsp; And so, we are working actively with members of the House, of the Senate this week so that there is a clear direction on how to advance much-needed jobs legislation when Congress resumes legislative business during the week of June 7.<br>&nbsp;<br>So this week will be incredibly critical.&nbsp; As we&#8217;ve mentioned and announced, Senator Capito is going to be meeting with the President tomorrow, and we&#8217;ll continue to have these conversations as we move forward in the next few weeks &#8212; in the next couple days.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Could you circle back to the NAACP criticism about student debt cancellation?&nbsp; Should we expect the President to address that at all today in his remarks?&nbsp; Or what does the White House make of that pretty harsh criticism from the NAACP on that front?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; As I stated, you know, in his American Families Plan, this is a priority &#8212; you know? &#8212; making sure that he made historical investment into HBCUs, Tribal colleges and universities, and minority-serving institutions.&nbsp; And he wants to keep to that promise and is going to work very hard towards that.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Today it&#8217;s going to be about, clearly, the Tulsa &#8212; Tulsa Massacre that happened 100 years ago, commemorating that, having conversations with the survivor.&nbsp; He announced, as we know, some key &#8212; some key elements on how he wants to deal with, you know, the wealth gap in communities, in particular minority communities, Black communities.&nbsp; So he&#8217;ll talk a little bit about that as well.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And so I don&#8217;t want to get ahead of him, and he&#8217;ll have more to say later today.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One more commodity question.&nbsp; OPEC decided to boost production.&nbsp; Did the President speak to any OPEC leaders about that move?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; I don’t have any comment on that.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, just to expand on Jeff’s question about Texas: The White House seems to have preferred ignore everything that former President Trump says and does &#8212; right? &#8212; ever since he’s left office.&nbsp; But isn&#8217;t this, kind of, the elephant in the room?&nbsp; Because he is the one pushing all this, you know, election theories and, you know, pretty successfully.&nbsp; There are millions and millions of Americans who seem to be, you know, drinking it and following it and acting on it, and pressuring their own elected officials.&nbsp; So does the President &#8212; does he ever plan to try and address this head on &#8212; what&#8217;s going on out there?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; So, I mean, a couple of things.&nbsp; You know, the President spoke about it.&nbsp; We put out a statement yest- &#8212; over the weekend.&nbsp; It’s part of a &#8212; as the President stated over the weekend &#8212; look, it’s part of an assault on democracy that we’ve seen far too often this year, and often disproportionately targeting Black and brown Americans.&nbsp; And it’s wrong; it’s un-American.&nbsp; In the 21st century, we should be making it easier, not harder, for every eligible voter to vote.<br>&nbsp;<br>So he is again calling on Congress to pass the For the People Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Amendment Act, and will continue to call on Americans &#8212; every party and persuasion &#8212; to stand up for our democracy and protect the right to vote and the integrity of our elections.<br>&nbsp;<br>And, look, you know, if you look back to November of 2020, that was an election to save our democracy, right?&nbsp; That was exactly what this election &#8212; that election was about.&nbsp; The President clearly won, because he&#8217;s now President.&nbsp; But President Biden also understands it&#8217;s going to take time to bring everyone together.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>He was &#8212; he was elected partially because people thought he would be a president that would bring both sides together.&nbsp; And that is the work that he&#8217;s been trying to do for the past hundred, you know, thirty days now &#8212; I’ve lost track of how many days &#8212; of trying to bring bipartisanship back &#8212; something we haven&#8217;t seen in, you know &#8212; in D.C. in some time.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And if you think about the American Rescue Plan, that had bipartisan support across the country &#8212; Republicans, Democrats, and independents.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s what the President is going to continue to do: try to bring both sides together and work with Congress to get the For the People Act passed, the John Lewis Voting Rights Act passed.&nbsp; And so that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re going to continue to do.&nbsp; And he&#8217;ll have &#8212; he&#8217;ll actually have more to say about that later today, so I don&#8217;t want to get ahead (inaudible).<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator Joe Manchin has expressed some concerns about the voting rights bill.&nbsp; Obviously, a crucial vote to push that forward.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; I’m so sorry, say that (inaudible).<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator Joe Manchin has expressed concerns.&nbsp; Has the President had any outreach with him or his office?&nbsp; Should we expect, you know, some more from the President on being more forceful in trying to get that passed?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Yes, like I said, Tyler, we’re going to have more.&nbsp; The President will have more to say about this later today.&nbsp; And as you could imagine, he talks to members on the Hill &#8212; House members, senators &#8212; pretty regularly.&nbsp; He&#8217;s been meeting with them pretty regularly on both sides of the aisle, and they&#8217;ve talked on &#8212; about an array of issues.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And so I&#8217;m going to not get ahead of what he&#8217;s going to say later today.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just one other topic.&nbsp; Is there any reaction from the White House to the reports that Denmark was assisting the U.S. in wiretapping some of these European leaders?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; So, in 2014, the United States issued a full review of our approach to overseas surveillance.&nbsp; President Obama issued a presidential directive that changed our approach in significant ways.<br>&nbsp;<br>We will work with our European allies and partners to address any questions through the appropriate national security channels.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Inaudible) on Tulsa.&nbsp; Do you have any details on the survivors that he&#8217;s going to be meeting with?&nbsp; How many?&nbsp; If you don&#8217;t have names, can you say how many, how big the group is?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; I think we&#8217;ll have more for all of you pretty &#8212; as we get closer to the meetings.&nbsp; I think what we announced was that he was going to meet with three of the survivors.&nbsp; And so we’ll have more.&nbsp; We’ll have more on that as we get closer to the meeting to share with you.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are you able to say at what point the President learned about what happened in Tulsa 100 years ago?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Yeah, so, as you can imagine, it’s a story the President has been long familiar with, a story that has not been told.&nbsp; The President wants to make sure it’s not a forgotten story.&nbsp; And the President wants to put it on record, which is one of the reasons why he’s coming today.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And I just wanted to read out a Tweet that he put out last year about this, which is: “The Tulsa Race Massacre is one of the worst incidents of racial violence in our history &#8212; and it has been erased from our national conscious[ness] for far too long.&nbsp; It’s time we reckon with what happened in 1921.”<br>&nbsp;<br>So this is, like I said, something that the President has been familiar with for some time.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karine, just a housekeeping thing on that, on the survivors meeting.&nbsp; Just a housekeeping: Could we put in the request with you that we’d love to see that?&nbsp; I know it’s closed as of right now, but if there’s a photo op that we could get, that’s a very significant meeting that I think people would like to see or have a chance to hear from the President after he has sat down with them.<br>&nbsp;<br>And then, a follow-up:&nbsp;Is there any consideration, given this latest ransomware attack &#8212; is there any rethinking of the summit with Vladimir Putin in two weeks?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Say that?&nbsp; I’m sorry.&nbsp; Say that &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there any rethinking of the summit with Vladimir<br>Putin in two weeks, given this latest ransomware attack?&nbsp; You said a criminal organization based in Russia.&nbsp; And conversations (inaudible).<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; Appreciate the question.&nbsp; So we do not regard, as you can imagine, this meeting with the Russian President as a reward.&nbsp; Right?&nbsp; We regard it as a vital part of defending America&#8217;s interests.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>President Biden is meeting with Vladimir Putin because of our country&#8217;s differences, not in spite of them.&nbsp; There&#8217;s a lot we have to work through.&nbsp; President Biden is the most effective communicator of American values and priorities, and hearing directly from President Putin is the most effective way to understand what Russia plans and intends.<br>&nbsp;<br>There is no substitute &#8212; right? &#8212; for a leader-to-leader engagement, particularly for complex relationships.&nbsp; So it is important for President Biden to sit down with President Putin, face to face, to be clear about where we are, to understand where he is, to try to manage differences and to identify areas where we can make progress.<br>&nbsp;<br>Thank you so much, everybody.<br>&nbsp;<br>1:07 P.M. EDT</p>
