										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>The United States and the European Commission have committed to a new Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework, which will foster trans-Atlantic data flows and address the concerns raised by the Court of Justice of the European Union when it struck down in 2020 the Commission’s adequacy decision underlying the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework. &nbsp;</p>



<p>This Framework will reestablish an important legal mechanism for transfers of EU personal data to the United States. The United States has committed to implement new safeguards to ensure that signals intelligence activities are necessary and proportionate in the pursuit of defined national security objectives, which will ensure the privacy of EU personal data and to create a new mechanism for EU individuals to seek redress if they believe they are unlawfully targeted by signals intelligence activities. This deal in principle reflects the strength of the enduring U.S.-EU relationship, as we continue to deepen our partnership based on our shared democratic values.</p>



<p>This Framework will provide vital benefits to citizens on both sides of the Atlantic. For EU individuals, the deal includes new, high-standard commitments regarding the protection of personal data. For citizens and companies on both sides of the Atlantic, the deal will enable the continued flow of data that underpins more than $1 trillion in cross-border commerce every year, and will enable businesses of all sizes to compete in each other’s markets. It is the culmination of more than a year of detailed negotiations between the EU and the U.S. following the 2020 decision by the Court of Justice of the European Union ruling that the prior EU-U.S. framework , known as Privacy Shield, &nbsp;did not satisfy EU legal requirements.</p>



<p>The new Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework underscores our shared commitment to privacy, data protection, the rule of law, and our collective security as well as our mutual recognition of the importance of trans-Atlantic data flows to our respective citizens, economies, and societies.&nbsp; Data flows are critical to the trans-Atlantic economic relationship and for all companies large and small across all sectors of the economy. In fact, more data flows between the United States and Europe than anywhere else in the world, enabling the $7.1 trillion U.S.-EU economic relationship.</p>



<p>By ensuring a durable and reliable legal basis for data flows, the new Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework will underpin an inclusive and competitive digital economy and lay the foundation for further economic cooperation. It addresses the Court of Justice of the European Union’s <em>Schrems II</em> decision concerning U.S, law governing signals intelligence activities. Under the Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework, the United States has made unprecedented commitments to:</p>



<ul><li>Strengthen the privacy and civil liberties safeguards governing U.S. signals intelligence activities;</li><li>Establish a new redress mechanism with independent and binding authority; and</li><li>Enhance its existing rigorous and layered oversight of signals intelligence activities.</li></ul>



<p>For example, the new Framework ensures that:</p>



<ul><li>Signals intelligence collection may be undertaken only where necessary to advance legitimate national security objectives, and must not disproportionately impact the protection of individual privacy and civil liberties;<br></li><li>EU individuals may seek redress from a new multi-layer redress mechanism that includes an independent Data Protection Review Court that would consist of individuals chosen from outside the U.S. Government who would have full authority to adjudicate claims and direct remedial measures as needed; and<br></li><li>U.S. intelligence agencies will adopt procedures to ensure effective oversight of new privacy and civil liberties standards.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Participating companies and organizations that take advantage of the Framework to legally protect data flows will continue to be required to adhere to the Privacy Shield Principles, including the requirement to self-certify their adherence to the Principles through the U.S. Department of Commerce. EU individuals will continue to have access to multiple avenues of recourse to resolve complaints about participating organizations, including through alternative dispute resolution and binding arbitration.</p>



<p>These new policies will be implemented by the U.S. intelligence community in a way to effectively protect its citizens, and those of its allies and partners, consistent with the high-standard protections offered under this Framework.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The teams of the U.S. government and the European Commission will now continue their cooperation with a view to translate this arrangement into legal documents that will need to be adopted on both sides to put in place this new Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework. For that purpose, these U.S. commitments will be included in an Executive Order that will form the basis of the Commission’s assessment in its future adequacy decision.</p>

<p>The United States and the European Commission announce that they have agreed in principle on a new Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework, which will foster trans-Atlantic data flows and address the concerns raised by the Court of Justice of the European Union in the <em>Schrems II</em> decision of July 2020. <br><br>The new Framework marks an unprecedented commitment on the U.S. side to implement reforms that will strengthen the privacy and civil liberties protections applicable to U.S. signals intelligence activities.  Under the Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework, the United States is to put in place new safeguards to ensure that signals surveillance activities are necessary and proportionate in the pursuit of defined national security objectives, establish a two-level independent redress mechanism with binding authority to direct remedial measures, and enhance rigorous and layered oversight of signals intelligence activities to ensure compliance with limitations on surveillance activities.<br><br>The Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework reflects more than a year of detailed negotiations between the U.S. and E.U. led by Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo and Commissioner for Justice Didier Reynders. It will provide a durable basis for trans-Atlantic data flows, which are critical to protecting citizens’ rights and enabling trans-Atlantic commerce in all sectors of the economy, including for small and medium enterprises.  By advancing cross-border data flows, the new framework will promote an inclusive digital economy in which all people can participate and in which companies of all sizes from all of our countries can thrive. <br><br>The announcement is another demonstration of the strength of the U.S.-EU relationship, in that we continue to deepen our partnership as a community of democracies to ensure both security and respect for privacy and to enable economic opportunities for our companies and citizens.  The new Framework will facilitate further U.S.-EU cooperation, including through the Trade and Technology Council and through multilateral fora, such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, on digital policies.<br><br>The teams of the U.S. Government and the European Commission will now continue their cooperation with a view to translate this arrangement into legal documents that will need to be adopted on both sides to put in place this new Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework. For that purpose, these U.S. commitments will be included in an Executive Order that will form the basis of the Commission’s assessment in its future adequacy decision.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Via Teleconference</p>



<p>10:45 A.M. CET<br><br>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Thanks so much for joining us, and I appreciate everyone&#8217;s flexibility.&nbsp; This call is going to be on background, attributable to “senior administration officials.”&nbsp; Not for your reporting but just for your knowledge, on this call we have [senior administration officials].<br><br>As we said in invite for this call, this call will be embargoed until the call concludes.&nbsp; And you all have received a factsheet on this earlier in the morning, as well.&nbsp; And as usual, we’ll have some time for questions afterwards.&nbsp;<br><br>But with that, I will turn it over to [senior administration official].<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Thanks, everybody, for joining.&nbsp; I&#8217;m going to say a few things about the energy agreement and then also the new transatlantic data privacy and security agreement as well.&nbsp;<br><br>So first, on energy: Today, President Biden and President von der Leyen are ushering in a new era of energy security for Europe.&nbsp;<br><br>As you all know, Putin’s war has highlighted an urgent need to reduce our dependence, Europe’s dependence on Russian fossil fuels.&nbsp; It’s very clear that Putin is continuing to use energy as a weapon to coerce and destabilize Europe.&nbsp; The task force we’re announcing today will hit hard at his ability to do this in the near term, and we’re working toward eliminating his ability to do so in the future.<br><br>So, the strategy that we’re announcing today to address the near term is to reduce demand for fossil fuels &#8212; natural gas in particular &#8212; and also filling in for natural gas that would have come from Russia in the very near term to avoid people getting cold this winter and next winter before clean energy is deployed at scale.<br><br>The President knows, and we’ve discussed at length, that the true path to energy security runs through clean energy.&nbsp; So that’s the second part of this agreement.&nbsp; The first part is getting Europe off Russian gas.&nbsp; The second part is getting Europe off gas altogether.&nbsp; And he’s committed to reducing our dependence on fossil fuels and reaping the climate, environmental, economic, and energy security benefits of moving decisively down that path.<br><br>With respect to the enhanced Privacy Shield agreement &#8212; you know, this trip has been all about unity.&nbsp; And when you have the unity that&#8217;s been forged between the U.S. and Europe, it creates a lot of trust and goodwill, and you can settle &#8212; you can settle issues that have been nagging at the relationship.&nbsp; And we did so with the Boeing-Airbus dispute &#8212; resolving that last summer, in June.&nbsp; We did so as well by lifting steel and aluminum tariffs in November.&nbsp; And this is another example of coming together on standards, on writing the rules of the road for data flows between Europe and the U.S.&nbsp; I mean, these data flows underpin the $7 trillion of commerce that takes place between the U.S. and the European Union.&nbsp;<br><br>And based on our shared &#8212; the shared importance we place on privacy, data protection, and rule of law, we&#8217;ve come together and we’ve now settled a dispute that&#8217;s been going on for over a year.&nbsp; Another example of why unity matters.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s going to forge our partnership even closer.<br><br>I&#8217;ll turn it over to [senior administration official] to say more about the energy deal.<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Thank you so much.&nbsp; So today we announced a task force that will be led out of the White House and the Office of the President of the European Commission to support the EU’s objective to end its dependence on Russian fossil fuels as soon as possible.&nbsp;<br><br>[Senior administration official] mentioned the two lines of effort, and I want to underscore that both lines of effort focus on ensuring that the task force is working to ensure European energy security in the near term while also recognizing that a rapid clean-energy transition to renewable energy, and including energy efficiency, are key tools that we will need to avoid these shocks in the future, while advancing our shared climate objectives.<br><br>The task force and international partners will target additional LNG volumes to Europe of at least 15 bcm this year, with expected increases going forward.<br><br>The task force will also simultaneously focus on reducing overall gas demand, in line with our shared climate and clean energy objectives.&nbsp; This includes engaging with key stakeholders, including from the private sector, to target immediate reductions in gas demand that can be achieved through ramping up energy efficiency measures and accelerating renewable energy development and deployment.<br><br>The REPowerEU plan, developed by the European Commission and released on March 8th to phase out of their dependence of Russian fossil fuels well before 2030, estimates that many of these measures can produce even greater savings in the near term.<br><br>According to their estimate &#8212; their estimate is that energy savings in homes alone can save at least 15.5 bcm by the end of this year.&nbsp; And they estimate that accelerating wind and solar deployments and by frontloading that can replace about 20 bcm by the end of this year &#8212; with their goal of saving over 170 bcm a year by 2030 through the plans the EU made before the invasion, such as Fit for 55.<br><br>So we &#8212; as we support our European partners in the face of Putin’s unprovoked and unjustified war of choice, we’re also strengthening their ability to meet their long-term objectives.<br><br>So with that, we’ll turn it over and take some questions.<br><br>MODERATOR:&nbsp; With that, why don’t we start with Mike Shear with the New York Times.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi guys.&nbsp; Thanks for having the call.&nbsp; I guess I wanted to clarify &#8212; I&#8217;ve seen it reported this morning that this is a deal for the U.S. to provide 15 billion bcm to Europe.&nbsp; I just want to clarify, it&#8217;s not that the U.S. has that amount that it will sell to the EU or ship to the EU, but rather that it&#8217;s coming from &#8212; it&#8217;s an effort to find that amount from other countries.&nbsp;<br><br>And just as a sort of corollary to that: Isn&#8217;t it the case that the U.S. and many of the other nations around the world are already running full tilt?&nbsp; And so, how do you find that amount of LNG when the U.S. and many of the other providers don&#8217;t seem to have that kind of excess volume &#8212; at least right now?&nbsp; How do you find that in the short run?&nbsp; Thank you.<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Hi, Mike.&nbsp; I&#8217;m happy to start.&nbsp; [Senior administration official], please feel free to add in.&nbsp;<br><br>So, you know, Mike, we have close to doubled our LNG exports to Europe over the past three to four months.&nbsp; But we also arranged, over the course of the winter months, a number of swaps from our partners all over the world, particularly in Asia, to supply more LNG to Europe during its winter, particularly given its low inventory and storage levels this year.&nbsp; And so we&#8217;re going to continue those efforts throughout 2022 &#8212; that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re committing to do &#8212; to hit the 15 bcm target.&nbsp;<br><br>And so this will involve a lot of diplomacy.&nbsp; We&#8217;re confident after talking with our partners, both in Asia but also in other parts of the world, that we can continue to hit that number.&nbsp; Basically, it continues at the rate at which we provided and arranged for LNG to be delivered to Europe through the past few months.&nbsp; So that&#8217;s a continuation of the effort.&nbsp;<br><br>And then, over time, what Europe is doing is it&#8217;s committing to stable demand for U.S. LNG &#8212; 50 bcm &#8212; basically to execute on its goal of reducing energy dependence on Russia and removing it altogether before the end of this decade.&nbsp; And that will involve a lot of commitments by Europe to build the LNG import infrastructure, the distributional needs, the storage needs in order to transport that LNG to places where they have a real need to have gas.&nbsp; Gas imports rise over time to replace Russian imports.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re going to do so, as [senior administration official] said, in a way that advances our clean energy goals.<br><br>So the LNG import terminals and the pipelines can be built in a way that facilitate the use of renewable energy that could be retrofitted for hydrogen, and that&#8217;s going to be a big part of the second part of the strategy here &#8212; is getting us off gas altogether, particularly in Europe.<br><br>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; Next, let&#8217;s go to Kayla Tausche with CNBC.<br><br>Kayla, you there?&nbsp; We can&#8217;t hear you.&nbsp; All right, you know, we will come back to you.<br><br>Next, why don&#8217;t we go to Jarrett Renshaw with Reuters.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks for taking the call.&nbsp; Just &#8212; can you just clarify the additional volume part?&nbsp; Are we talking &#8212; is there an “all in” number here that the U.S. is committing (inaudible), a preexisting number plus the 15?&nbsp; So if we can get some clarification on that, that would be great.<br><br>And secondly, on the one hand, you&#8217;re talking about increased production, more natural gas flowing out of the U.S., and also at same time, looking to stop it flowing and stop the production of natural gas.&nbsp; What incentive do U.S. companies have to build out this infrastructure &#8212; U.S. natural gas companies?&nbsp; Wouldn&#8217;t they just &#8212; if the policy is to essentially shut them down at some point, what&#8217;s their incentive, given the length of these supply contracts that are needed to fund the infrastructure?<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Good questions.&nbsp; [Senior administration official], do you want to start on this?<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; Happy to.<br><br>So, let me clarify: On &#8212; there is not an aggregate number.&nbsp; Right?&nbsp; This is about &#8212; this is looking at &#8212; the Europeans actually do have an aggregate number, which is to reduce their reliance on Russian gas by the end &#8212; by well before 2030.&nbsp; And so, in the joint statement, they put 27 &#8212; “by 2027” is the target that they want to reduce that by.&nbsp; So that&#8217;s really their goal.&nbsp; That&#8217;s about &#8212; 155 bcm total is what they used from Russia in 2021.&nbsp; And so my understanding is that that&#8217;s their aggregate number, globally, that Europe is looking to aim to do.<br><br>And so the U.S. is trying to do our part and contribute to that.&nbsp; And as the President von der Leyen said today, 50 bcm &#8212; and also according to the International Energy Agency &#8212; that&#8217;s about a third of what they get from Russia today.<br><br>Regarding the question about the reducing gas demand, I should clarify that point.&nbsp; So, on that point, what we&#8217;re talking about are measures to reduce the demand for gas in the European system.&nbsp; Europe has identified things such as smart thermostats, or turning down your &#8212; degree of your home by one degree can save about 10 bcm.&nbsp; They&#8217;re looking at things like accelerating solar and wind deployment that reduce the demand for gas in the system.<br><br>The joint statement that we released today &#8212; we&#8217;ll be releasing today &#8212; talk about the infrastructure that will be built by the Europeans, on the European side, to be clean and renewable hydrogen-ready.&nbsp; That’s an example of where gas continues to move to Europe, but it&#8217;s done in a way that then contributes clean and renewable hydrogen in the future.<br><br>And so, again, these are the signals we&#8217;re trying to send to the marketplace about the role that gas plays going forward in the future.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not about turning off the gas completely in the near term; it&#8217;s about making sure that it is low carbon, that the greenhouse gas intensity of the carbon and the gas over time is decreasing, aligned with our net-zero goals.&nbsp;<br><br>And if you look at technology that&#8217;s out there today, as well as we&#8217;re investing in both at home and overseas &#8212; like carbon capture, utilization, and storage &#8212; these are technologies that help reduce the carbon intensity of gas going forward and into Europe to be aligned with their strategy.<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; And just to add on a bit, Jarrett: On the first part of your question, if you look at what Russia currently ships to the EU in terms of LNG, it is about 15 bcm.&nbsp; Now, the pipes gas, as [senior administration official] referenced, is much larger; it&#8217;s 155 billion cubic meters.&nbsp;<br><br>So, in 2022 &#8212; you can think of why 15 &#8212; that’s the additional LNG we&#8217;re going to provide to Europe, and the idea is to get them off of Russian LNG in the very, very short term.&nbsp;<br><br>But then over time &#8212; your question was along the lines of, “What are you going to do with the infrastructure that&#8217;s built to supply additional gas?”&nbsp; And here, the important point to realize: These are not going to be stranded assets.&nbsp; The infrastructure that&#8217;s built in Europe &#8212; for example, in the distribution and the storage capacity, and even the powering of these LNG import facilities &#8212; the goal here is to build those facilities and build that infrastructure using renewable energy, using pipelines that could be used for hydrogen.&nbsp; And so, these aren&#8217;t going to be stranded assets; they&#8217;re going to be used for the clean energy infrastructure (inaudible) over time, well beyond 2030.<br><br>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Let’s try Kayla with CNBC again.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi guys.&nbsp; Can you hear me now?&nbsp;<br><br>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Yep, go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All right.&nbsp; Sorry about that before.&nbsp; If the European demand remains stable, what is your understanding of how your plans to replace the remaining 100 billion-or-so cubic meters that it currently gets from Russia?&nbsp;<br><br>And just to put a finer point on it, exactly how much does the administration expect U.S. producers to increase drilling and fracking by, for the next decade, to meet this goal?&nbsp; Thank you.<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Sorry, I couldn&#8217;t &#8212; I couldn&#8217;t hear that, Kayla.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t &#8212; [senior administration official], I don&#8217;t &#8212; maybe it came through more clearly on your side.<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Kayla, was your question &#8212; I think I caught some of it.&nbsp;<br><br>So, in terms of the additional 100 bcm of the 155, I would, you know, sort of direct you to the REPowerEU plan that they put out on March 8th, where they walk through a series of gas diversification measures, how they would electrify Europe, and how they would transform their industry, and to reach that &#8212; that full amount.&nbsp; And they have timeframes for that.&nbsp; And again, 2027, I believe, is their &#8212; is how they&#8217;re trying to pull that “by 2030” target forward.<br><br>But it&#8217;s everything from boosting biomethane, boosting the hydrogen production that’ll take place in (inaudible) by 2030, looking at solar rooftops, heat pump rollouts, frontloading wind and solar, and looking at EUI efforts around energy efficiency.&nbsp; And they did some of that add-up and aggregation to get to those volumes and those numbers.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s also where you see the European Commission talking about today, looking at an EU mechanism of pooling to ensure that they can fill storage, that they can ensure that they can work with member states around import infrastructure.&nbsp;<br><br>You saw Germany announced, I think about two weeks ago, that they&#8217;re looking to build two more import terminals, and they&#8217;re looking, I think, at a floating storage regasification unit in the near term for that.&nbsp;<br><br>So those are some measures on the hundred that I think that was your question.&nbsp;<br><br>In terms of your question regarding what are we asking of U.S. production, I would &#8212; there, I would just take a look at what we have already permitted in the United States, what is already under construction.&nbsp; And this is really about where the market wants to take it.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s why hearing from the European Union today that they&#8217;re looking to work with their member states to ensure a stable demand of a specific volume through 2030 is really important to send a signal of where we&#8217;ve already permitted.&nbsp;<br><br>There&#8217;s various numbers out there, but there is a significant amount of volume of new production capacity from the United States that has already been permitted by the Department of Energy and others for build-out.&nbsp; And we also have two active facilities already under construction that&#8217;ll be probably ready by 2024, 2025.&nbsp;<br><br>So when you think about new volumes of production, I’d take a look at what we&#8217;ve already permitted and what&#8217;s already under construction.&nbsp; Thank you.<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; And, you know, in our discussions &#8212; just to add on to [senior administration official]’s answer &#8212; in our discussions with the Europeans, you know, Russian gas has been very cheap for a long time, but it&#8217;s also quite obvious that it&#8217;s very risky.&nbsp;<br><br>And so, Europe wants to manage its risks in a better way, really with a portfolio approach.&nbsp; The U.S. is now the biggest supplier of LNG, so we&#8217;ll be a big part of it, but there&#8217;ll be other suppliers too.&nbsp; And they&#8217;ve been working with producers of LNG across the world.&nbsp;<br><br>The point here is to replace an unreliable supplier of LNG with a much more reliable and secure partner in the U.S.<br><br>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Next, let’s go to Josh Wingrove from Bloomberg.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you so much for doing this.&nbsp; And, you know, bear with us who &#8212; those of us who&#8217;ve been in the travel pool &#8212; in a fuzzy period of sleep.&nbsp; So, let me just make some clarity on this.&nbsp; Of the 15, how much of that do you think will come from the U.S., number one?&nbsp;<br><br>Number two, [senior administration official], you just mentioned the two existing facilities under production.&nbsp; Do you believe the U.S. needs more export facilities on top of that to service this goal and this vision?&nbsp; Or does the existing expansion and plan sort of meet that target?&nbsp;<br><br>And of the 15, if we don&#8217;t know how much is coming from the U.S., can we say how much is coming from Asia, for instance?&nbsp;<br><br>And, [senior administration official], we don&#8217;t really have a factsheet yet on what this data deal is.&nbsp; Can you tell us anything of what the terms of it &#8212; you know, what it&#8217;ll change for the U.S. or what it will change for Europe?&nbsp; Like, what was the &#8212; what is the deal itself?&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; [Senior administration official], do you want to take the first, and I&#8217;ll address the second question from Josh?<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Sure, of course.&nbsp; So, on the 15 &#8212; again, can&#8217;t speak to exactly where that 15 is coming from.&nbsp; (Inaudible) an active conversation among multiple parties, and again, where the market is looking to move those existing volumes.&nbsp; And so, you know, whether or not it&#8217;s a U.S. cargo or an Asian cargo, what have you, we don&#8217;t have those specifics to share with you today.&nbsp;<br><br>On your second question around U.S. exports and what&#8217;s under construction and what&#8217;s already in production today &#8212; and I&#8217;m trying to find the final number, and we’ll have to get back to you with it.&nbsp; But by my last check, we already &#8212; you know, again, what&#8217;s permitted for export terminals for construction today will get us to, I believe &#8212; and again, I don&#8217;t have the current number &#8212; but it&#8217;ll certainly be sufficient to meet the 50 demand coming out of Europe today &#8212; or by 2030.&nbsp;<br><br>And so, I would say on that: Again, there&#8217;s a plentiful amount of export capacity looking to come online in the near future.&nbsp; And, really, what they&#8217;re looking is to reach final investment decision, or FID.<br><br>Over to you, [senior administration official].<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; Thanks, [senior administration official].&nbsp; On the second question, Josh, I mean, the problem we&#8217;ve been trying to solve for over a year now is that the European Court of Justice invalidated the previous so- called Privacy Shield, which allowed for data flow from Europe to the U.S.&nbsp;<br><br>And a couple of the primary concerns that have been raised involved potential surveillance of European consumers by our intelligence agencies.&nbsp; And so, that and a few other issues related to privacy and security were at the crux of the negotiations over the past year.&nbsp;<br><br>And without an agreement that dealt with the Court of Justice &#8212; the European Court of Justice’s issues with the previous Privacy Shield, it put at risk the data flow that takes place between our two economies.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s an especially big problem for small businesses and medium-sized businesses that can&#8217;t easily come up with a contract that provides comfort for those companies that are doing business in Europe.&nbsp;<br><br>And it really threatened &#8212; I mean, in today&#8217;s age, the digital flows between the U.S and Europe are so large that it really threatened a significant chunk of our trading relationship.&nbsp;<br><br>And so, we&#8217;ve now come to an agreement on how to deal with Europe’s concerns.&nbsp; And it really is based on a shared understanding of what privacy means in terms of data flow, what security should look like, what the rule of law &#8212; how it should operate.&nbsp; And that was really the basis on which we found compromise.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s a really big deal, especially for small and midsize businesses that were at risk of losing their &#8212; losing their revenue flow from Europe.<br><br>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; Next, let’s go to Tyler Pager with the Washington Post.&nbsp; And this is probably our last question because I think our speakers have to run to some other engagements.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; And I had to jump on a little late, so I apologize if this question has already been asked.&nbsp; But in the factsheet, it says that, “This will also be done on the understanding that prices should reflect long-term market fundamentals and stability of supply and demand.”&nbsp; We had heard from some EU officials some grumbling about how much the European Union will have to pay.&nbsp; Has there been an agreement on pricing, either for this year or moving into the future?&nbsp; Any more detail you can provide on that?<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; So, I mean &#8212; so the reference there is making the point that spot prices are really high right now.&nbsp; And so, the agreement is not to lock in those spot prices indefinitely, because those prices can change, and ideally they move lower as supplies go up.&nbsp; And so that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s referencing long-term supply and demand fundamentals; that we shouldn&#8217;t just be looking to spot prices to strike a long-term agreement, which is what this is.&nbsp; And so that&#8217;s the &#8212; that&#8217;s the intuition.<br><br>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; Well, thanks again, everyone, for joining today.&nbsp;<br><br>Again, this call is on background, attributable to “senior administration officials,” and embargoed until the call concludes, which will be momentarily.&nbsp;<br><br>Thanks again for joining, everybody.&nbsp; And talk to you all soon.&nbsp;<br><br>11:08 A.M. CET</p>

<p>10:05 A.M. CET</p>



<p>PRESIDENT BIDEN:&nbsp; Good morning.&nbsp; Today I’m proud to once again be standing together with President von der Leyen as we announce a new groundbreaking initiative between the European Union and the United States.<br>&nbsp;<br>First, we’re coming together to reduce Europe’s dependence on Russian energy.&nbsp; Putin has issued Russia’s energy resources to coerce and manipulate its neighbors.&nbsp; That’s how he’s used it.&nbsp; He’s used the profits to drive his war machine.<br>&nbsp;<br>And that’s why, earlier this month, I announced the United States would ban all imports of Russian energy to make it clear that the American people would not be part of subsidizing Putin’s brutal, unjustified war against the people of Ukraine.<br>&nbsp;<br>At the time, I noted that we were able to take those steps when others could not because the United States is a net energy exporter of energy, with a strong domestic industry.<br>&nbsp;<br>And the United States welcomed the European Union’s powerful statement earlier this month committing to rapidly reduce its dependence on Russian gas.</p>



<p>Today we’ve agreed on a joint game plan toward that goal while accelerating our progress toward a secure clean energy future.<br>&nbsp;<br>This initiative focuses on two core issues: One, helping Europe reduce its dependency on Russian gas as quickly as possible.&nbsp; And, secondly, reducing Europe’s demand for gas overall.<br>&nbsp;<br>To address the first point, the United States, together with our international partners, they’re going to &#8212; we’re going to work to ensure an additional 15 &#8212; one-five &#8212; 15 billion cubic meters of liquified natural gas &#8212; LNG &#8212; for Europe this year.<br>&nbsp;<br>And as the EU works to discontinue buying Russian gas well before 2030, it will also work to ensure additional EU market demand for 50 billion cubic meters of LNG from the United States annually by 2030.<br>&nbsp;<br>To accomplish this, the European Commission is going to work with the member states to store gas across the continent, to build more infrastructure to receive LNG, and to take steps to increase the efficiency of gas.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>This build-out &#8212; this build-out will occur in a way that consists &#8212; is consistent with, not in conflict with, the zero &#8212; net-zero climate goal we &#8212; that we’re shooting for.&nbsp; It’s going to take some time to adjust gas supply chains and infrastructure as is built the last decade &#8212; for the last decade.<br>&nbsp;<br>So we’re going to have to make sure the families in Europe can get through this winter and the next while we’re building an infrastructure for a diversified, resilient, and clean energy future.<br>&nbsp;<br>At the same time, this crisis also presents an opportunity.&nbsp; It’s a catalyst &#8212; a catalyst that will drive the investments we need to double-down on our clean energy goals and accelerate progress toward our net-zero emissions future.<br>&nbsp;<br>That’s what the second part of this initiative is all about.<br>&nbsp;<br>The United States and the European Union are going to work together to take concrete measures to reduce dependence on natural gas &#8212; period &#8212; and to maximize the available &#8212; the avail- &#8212; the availability and use of renewable energy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>We’re going to accelerate widespread adoption of energy-efficient technologies and equipment, like smart thermostats, the work &#8212; that work to &#8212; and work to electrify heating systems all across Europe.<br>&nbsp;<br>We’re going to invest in innovative solutions and technologies to make the switch from fossil fuels.<br>&nbsp;<br>And together, we’ll advance the use of clean and renewable hydrogen to reduce our carbon emissions.<br>&nbsp;<br>This &#8212; these steps will increase energy security, economic security, and national security.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And we’re going to stand up a joint task force to implement these changes and drive progress that will be co-chaired by representatives from the White House and the President of the European Union’s team &#8212; Commission’s team.<br>&nbsp;<br>Madam President, I know &#8212; I know that eliminating Russian gas will have costs for Europe.&nbsp; But it’s not only the right thing to do from a moral standpoint, it’s going to put us on a much stronger strategic footing.<br>&nbsp;<br>And I’m proud to announce that we’ve also reached another major breakthrough in transatlantic data flows.&nbsp; Privacy and security are key elements of my digital agenda.<br>&nbsp;<br>And today, we’ve agreed to unprecedented protections for data privacy and security for our citizens.<br>&nbsp;<br>This new agreement will enhance the Privacy Shield Framework; promote growth and innovation in Europe and the United States; and help companies, both small and large, compete in the digital economy.<br>&nbsp;<br>Just as we did when we resolved the Boeing-Airbus dispute and lifted the steel and aluminum tariffs, the United States and the EU are finding creative, new approaches to knit our economies and our people closer together, grounded on shared values.<br>&nbsp;<br>This framework underscores our shared commitment to privacy, to data protection, and to the rule of law.&nbsp; And it’s going to allow the European Commission to once again authorize<br>transatlantic data flows that help facilitate $7.1 trillion in economic relationships with the EU.<br>&nbsp;<br>So thank you again, Madam President, for your personal friendship, for your partnership, and above all, your leadership.<br>&nbsp;<br>All of this is bringing the European Union and the United States even closer together, and that’s a win for all of us.<br>&nbsp;<br>So I thank you all, and I’m now going to yield the podium to the President.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Let me pull this out.&nbsp; (Pulls out the step stool.)&nbsp; Got to earn my salary here.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Is it out enough?&nbsp; There you go.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; (Laughs.)&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>PRESIDENT VON DER LEYEN:&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Mr. President, Dear Joe, your presence here in Brussels this week &#8212; at the NATO summit, at the G7, and at our European Council &#8212; sends a very powerful message to the world.<br>&nbsp;<br>The transatlantic partnership stands stronger and more united than ever.&nbsp; And we are determined to stand up against Russia’s brutal war.&nbsp; This war will be a strategic failure for Putin.<br>&nbsp;<br>Our cooperation on the four successive waves of sanctions against Russia has been extraordinary and exceptional.&nbsp; The sanctions are now working their way deep into the Russian system, draining Putin’s resources to finance this atrocious war.<br>&nbsp;<br>Our work on sanctions also shows that when we act together, we’re stronger and we really can make a difference.<br>&nbsp;<br>And we are continuing to reinforce our cooperation in many strategic ways: on humanitarian and security assistance to Ukraine; on energy; on fighting the threats against our democracies; on solving outstanding issues in the EU-U.S. cooperation, including in data protec- &#8212; protection and privacy.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>In a world faced with disorder, our transatlantic unity upholds fundamental values and rules that our citizens believe in.&nbsp; Let me focus first on refugees.<br>&nbsp;<br>Until now, around three and a half million people have left Ukraine, half of them children.&nbsp; Every second refugee is a child.&nbsp; And the numbers will keep rising.&nbsp; So, together, we are mobilizing massive resources to support those displaced by the conflict, be it in Ukraine or in the neighboring countries.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Just this week, for example, I announced that the European Union will allocate an extra 3.4 billion euros for this purpose, and more will come.&nbsp; This demonstrates our deep support for Ukraine and its citizens.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And I want to tell the American people how grateful Europe is for their unwavering support.&nbsp; This support also extends to strengthening Europe&#8217;s energy security and independence from Russian fossil fuels.&nbsp; As you know, we aim to reduce this dependency on Russian fossil fuels and to get rid of it.&nbsp; And this can only be achieved through, of course, first of all, investment in renewables, but also through additional gas supplies, including LNG deliveries.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So we want, as Europeans, to diversify away from Russia, towards suppliers that we trust, that are friends, and that are reliable.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And therefore, the U.S. commitment to provide the European Union with additional at least 15 billion cubic meters of LNG this year is a big step in this direction because this will replace the LNG supply we currently receive from Russia.<br>&nbsp;<br>And looking ahead, the United States and Europe will ensure stable demand and supply for additional at least 50 billion cubic meter of U.S. LNG until 2030.&nbsp; And if we look at that, this amount, 50 bcm per year, is replacing one third already of the Russian gas going to Europe today.&nbsp; So, we are right in &#8212; on track now to diversify away from Russian gas and towards our friends’ and partners’ reliable and trustworthy suppliers.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>We need to secure our supplies not just for next winter but also for the years ahead.&nbsp; And this is a &#8212; an important, a big starting point to do that.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Our partnership aims to sustain us through this war, to work on our independence from Russian fossil fuels, but it also focuses on building a greener future with climate neutrality.&nbsp; We will work together also with our energy-intensive industry.&nbsp; And the good news is that the infrastructure that we use for gas today can be used for clean hydrogen in the future.&nbsp; So, this investment we are doing right now is also an investment in the decarbonizing of our economy.<br>&nbsp;<br>The cooperation shows the power of our democracies.&nbsp; I particularly welcome that we will step up our respective action on strengthening democracies, the rule of law, the freedom of media in the world.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And we also need to continue adapting our own democracies to a changing world.&nbsp; This is particularly true when it comes to digitalization, in which the protection of personal data and privacy has become so crucial.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And therefore, I&#8217;m very pleased that we have found an agreement in principle on a new framework for transatlantic data flows.&nbsp; This will enable predictable and trustworthy data flows between the EU and U.S., safeguarding privacy and civil liberties.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And I really want to thank Commissioner Reynders and Secretary Raimondo for their tireless efforts over the past month to finish a balanced and effective solution.&nbsp; This is another step in our &#8212; strengthening our partnership.&nbsp; We managed to balance security and the right to privacy and data protection.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Mr. President, Dear Joe: Putin is trying to turn back the clock to another era &#8212; an era of brutal use of force, of power politics, of spheres of influence, and internal repression.&nbsp; I am confident he will fail.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>We are working together to forge a peaceful, prosperous, and sustainable future.&nbsp; And I know we will succeed.<br>&nbsp;<br>Thank you very much.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>PRESIDENT BIDEN:&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>PRESIDENT VON DER LEYEN:&nbsp; Thank you very much.<br>&nbsp;<br>PRESIDENT BIDEN:&nbsp; Thank you, everyone.<br>&nbsp;<br>10:18 A.M. CET&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Preamble<br></strong><br>The United States and the European Commission are committed to reducing Europe’s dependency on Russian energy. We reaffirm our joint commitment to Europe’s energy security and sustainability and to accelerating the global transition to clean energy. In condemning in the strongest terms Russia’s further invasion of Ukraine, we express our solidarity and support for Ukraine. We share the objective of addressing the energy security emergency – to ensure energy supply for the EU and Ukraine. We welcome the continued progress toward the physical integration of Ukraine with the EU energy markets. The energy security and sustainability of the EU and Ukraine are essential for peace, freedom and democracy in Europe.</p>



<p>Through the Joint European action for more affordable, secure and sustainable energy (REPowerEU), the EU confirmed its objective to reach independence from Russian fossil fuels well before the end of the decade, replacing them with stable, affordable, reliable, and clean energy supplies for EU citizens and businesses.</p>



<p>The United States and the EU are committed to meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement, achieving the objective of net zero emissions by 2050, and keeping a 1.5 degrees Celsius limit on temperature rise within reach, including through a rapid clean energy transition, renewable energy, and energy efficiency. These policies and technologies will also contribute to making the EU independent from Russian fossil fuels. Natural gas remains an important part of the EU energy system in the green transition, including by ensuring its carbon intensity decreases over time.</p>



<p>The United States and European Commission confirm our strategic energy cooperation for security of energy supply and reducing dependence on fossil fuels. We share efforts to make available stable, affordable, reliable and clean energy supplies to citizens and businesses in the EU and its neighbouring partner nations. In this framework, we establish an immediate cooperation to address the emergency energy security objective of ensuring appropriate levels of gas storage ahead of next winter and the following one. We will continue our close cooperation on other measures to accelerate the green energy transition, lower energy consumption and reduce dependence on fossil fuels.</p>



<p><strong>Task Force on Energy Security<br></strong><br>The United States and the European Commission will immediately establish a joint Task Force on Energy Security to set out the parameters of this cooperation and execute its implementation. The Task Force will be chaired by a representative from the White House and a representative of the President of the European Commission.</p>



<p>This Task Force will focus on the following urgent issues: &nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>The United States will strive to ensure, including working with international partners, additional liquified natural gas (LNG) volumes for the EU market of at least 15 bcm in 2022 with expected increases going forward.<br></li><li>The United States and European Commission will undertake efforts to reduce the greenhouse gas intensity of all new LNG infrastructure and associated pipelines, including through the use of clean energy to power onsite operations, the reduction of methane leakage, and the construction of clean and renewable hydrogen ready infrastructure.<br></li><li>The United States commits to maintaining an enabling regulatory environment with procedures to review and expeditiously act upon applications to permit any additional export LNG capacities that would be needed to meet this emergency energy security objective and support the RePowerEU goals, affirming the joint resolve to terminate EU dependence on Russian fossil fuels by 2027.<br></li><li>The European Commission will work with the governments of EU Member States to accelerate their regulatory procedures to review and determine approvals for LNG import infrastructure, to include onshore facilities and related pipelines to support imports using floating storage regasification unit vessels, and fixed LNG import terminals.<br></li><li>The European Commission will work with EU Member States and market operators to pool demand through a newly established EU Energy platform for additional volumes between April and October 2022. The European Commission will also support long-term contracting mechanisms and partner with the U.S. to encourage relevant contracting to support final investment decisions on both LNG export and import infrastructure.<br></li><li>The European Commission will work with EU Member States toward ensuring stable demand for additional U.S. LNG until at least 2030 of approximately 50 bcm/annum, on the understanding that the price formula of LNG supplies to the EU should reflect long-term market fundamentals, and stability of the cooperation of the demand and supply side, and that this growth be consistent with our shared net zero goals. In particular, price formula should include consideration of Henry Hub Natural Gas Spot Price and other stabilising factors.<br></li><li>The EU is preparing an upgraded regulatory framework for energy security of supply and storage. This will enhance certainty and predictability regarding security of supply and storage needs and ensure closer cooperation within the EU and its neighbouring partner nations. The European Commission has proposed regulation on energy storage to ensure that the existing storage infrastructure is filled up to 90% of its capacity by 1 November each year, with specific phase-in provisions for 2022. The European Commission will coordinate with the Member States and provide transparency with respect to available LNG capacity in EU terminals.<br></li><li>The United States and the European Commission will engage key stakeholders, including the private sector, to formulate immediate recommendations that will reduce overall gas demand through accelerating market deployment and utilization of clean energy technologies and measures in Europe and the United States such as:</li></ul>



<ul><li>Partnering on technologies and energy efficiency solutions such as ramping up demand response devices (such as smart thermostats) and heat pump deployment and installations, scaling procurement for clean energy equipment, investing in innovative technologies and fuel-switching away from fossil fuels.<br></li><li>Expediting planning and approval for renewable energy projects and strategic energy cooperation including in offshore wind technologies.<br></li><li>Developing a strategy to accelerate workforce development to support the rapidly deployment of clean energy technologies, including an expansion of solar and wind.<br></li><li>Collaborating to advance the production and use of clean and renewable hydrogen to displace unabated fossil fuels and cut greenhouse gas emissions, including by investing in technology development and supporting infrastructure.</li></ul>



<ul><li>The European Commission is working to advance measures that reduce gas consumption by maximizing renewable energy generation and utilization, including by reducing curtailment rates.<br></li><li>The United States and the European Commission are resolved to negotiate and then implement an ambitious emissions-based Global Arrangement on Steel and Aluminum Trade that incentives industrial decarbonization and lowers energy demand.</li></ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>Today, President Joe Biden and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced a joint Task Force to reduce Europe’s dependence on Russian fossil fuels and strengthen European energy security as President Putin wages his war of choice against Ukraine.<br><br>This Task Force for Energy Security will be chaired by a representative from the White House and a representative of the President of the European Commission. It will work to ensure energy security for Ukraine and the EU in preparation for next winter and the following one while supporting the EU’s goal to end its dependence on Russian fossil fuels.<br><br>The Task Force will organize its efforts around two primary goals: (1) Diversifying liquefied natural gas (LNG) supplies in alignment with climate objectives; (2) Reducing demand for natural gas.<br><br><strong>Diversifying LNG Supplies in Alignment with Climate Objectives</strong></p>



<ul><li>The United States will work with international partners and strive to ensure additional LNG volumes for the EU market of at least 15 bcm in 2022, with expected increases going forward.<br></li><li>The United States and the European Commission will undertake efforts to reduce the greenhouse gas intensity of all new LNG infrastructure and associated pipelines, including through using clean energy to power onsite operations, reducing methane leakage, and building clean and renewable hydrogen-ready infrastructure.<br></li><li>The European Commission will prepare an upgraded regulatory framework for energy security of supply and storage, as well as working with EU Member States to accelerate regulatory procedures to review and determine approvals for LNG import infrastructure. The United States will maintain its regulatory environment with an emphasis on supporting this emergency energy security objective and the REPowerEU goals.<br></li><li>The European Commission will work with EU Member States toward the goal of ensuring, until at least 2030, demand for approximately 50 bcm/year of additional U.S. LNG that is consistent with our shared net-zero goals. This also will be done on the understanding that prices should reflect long-term market fundamentals and stability of supply and demand.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Reducing Demand for Natural Gas</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">A PROCLAMATION</p>



<p>    In forming a Government that reflected the burgeoning spirit of America and united our young Nation around the core principles of liberty, justice, and the rule of law, our Founders looked to the birthplace of democracy &#8212; Greece.&nbsp;&nbsp;Decades after the American Revolution, the people of Greece came together to bravely affirm their commitment to democracy and declare their own independence from the Ottoman Empire.&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, as we mark the anniversary of Greek independence, we honor our countries&#8217; deep and historic bond &#8212; forged in the struggle for liberty and self-governance &#8212; and the many contributions of the modern Hellenic Republic which promote international peace and stability and uphold our shared values.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Greek bicentennial in 2021 was a year of celebration for Greece, for the Greek American community, and for the strong bilateral relationship between our two nations.&nbsp;&nbsp;The seeds of friendship planted long ago continue to bear fruit for both our people, with Greece and the United States standing together to defend democracy around the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;A crucial ally in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Greece promotes peace and prosperity in the Eastern Mediterranean, Black Sea, and Western Balkans regions, and the United States is grateful for Greece&#8217;s continuing hospitality to the United States Naval Support Activity Souda Bay on Crete.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greece and the United States are standing together to confront the challenges of our time, from meeting the climate crisis and diversifying the region&#8217;s energy resources to proving that democracies deliver for our people and pushing back against the growing threat of authoritarianism.&nbsp;&nbsp;Through our ongoing Strategic Dialogue, Greece and the United States have increased cooperation across a range of critical issues, and last year&#8217;s update to our Mutual Defense Cooperation Agreement will boost our defense and security cooperation for years to come.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deep political and historical bonds that unite Greece and the United States are further reinforced by strong ties of family and affection and by the estimated 3 million Americans of Greek descent across our Nation.&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout my career, I have seen firsthand the courage and determination of the Greek American community, and these qualities have been an invaluable source of strength to our Nation over the past year.&nbsp;&nbsp;Greek Americans have been at the forefront of the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic and our efforts to vaccinate the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;And last November, as Greek Americans proudly celebrated the construction of the Saint Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church and National Shrine in Manhattan 20 years after the original church structure had been destroyed in the September 11th terrorist attacks, they embodied our shared values of perseverance, resilience, and hope for the future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Greece and the United States look forward to what the next 200 years of partnership will bring, I am confident that our nations and our people will meet every challenge together.&nbsp;&nbsp;On this day, we recommit to the hard work ahead, to fortifying our democracies, and to reaffirming our ironclad friendship.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 25, 2022, as Greek Independence Day:&nbsp;&nbsp;<a>A National Day of Celebration of Greek and American Democracy.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;I call upon the people of the United States to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fourth day of March, in the year of our Lord two&nbsp;thousand&nbsp;twenty-two, and of the Independence of the United&nbsp;States of&nbsp;America the two&nbsp;hundred and forty-sixth.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-right">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.</p>

<p>Today, the European Council was joined by President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. of the United States. The leaders discussed the coordinated and united response of the European Union and the United States to Russia&#8217;s unprovoked and unjustified military aggression in Ukraine. They reviewed their ongoing efforts to impose economic costs on Russia and Belarus, as well as their readiness to adopt additional measures and to stop any attempts to circumvent sanctions. Leaders discussed the urgent needs caused by Russia’s aggression, committed to continuing providing humanitarian assistance, including to neighboring countries hosting refugees, and underscored the need for Russia to guarantee humanitarian access to those affected by or fleeing the violence. Leaders welcomed the opening of international investigations, including by the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, and ongoing efforts to gather evidence of atrocities. In addition, leaders discussed EU-U.S. cooperation to reduce dependence on Russian fossil fuels, accelerate the transition to clean energy, as well as the need to respond to evolving food security needs worldwide. The leaders also concurred on the importance of strengthening democratic resilience in Ukraine, Moldova, and the wider Eastern partnership region. Finally, leaders underscored the importance of enhancing transatlantic security and defense, including through robust NATO-EU cooperation as described in the EU’s Strategic Compass.</p>
