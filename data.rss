<p>6:01 P.M. EDT<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Well, hello, everyone.&nbsp; Welcome to the White House.&nbsp; This is the biggest crowd we’ve had since we got here.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>I’m Joe Biden.&nbsp; I’m Jill Biden’s husband.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; And proud of it.&nbsp;<br><br>Welcome to Women’s History Month celebration.&nbsp; We’re honored to have what may well be the most inspiring event we’ve had at the White House so far.<br><br>I’ve often said that America’s strength is not just the example of our power, but the power of our example.&nbsp; And I mean that.&nbsp; Look at &#8212; I was going to say: Look at this stage, but that’s enough too.&nbsp; Look at this stage.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; But there’s been a little change in the arrangement of who’s on the stage because of the First Lady’s husband contracting COVID.&nbsp;<br><br>But look at this room and what you see.<br><br>THE FIRST LADY:&nbsp; (Inaudible.)<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Pardon?<br><br>THE FIRST LADY:&nbsp; You said the First &#8212; anyways.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Laughter.)<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; That’s right.&nbsp; She’s fine.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; It’s me that’s not together.<br><br>The Second La- &#8212; the First Gentleman.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; How about that.<br><br>Anyway, an incredible group of members of Congress, led by Nancy Pelosi, the first woman Speaker &#8212; (applause) &#8212; who I believe will be considered one of the greatest Speakers in our history.&nbsp; And I mean that.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br><br>And she knows I mean it.&nbsp; I’ve been saying it for years.&nbsp;<br><br>And members of the most diverse Cabinet in the history of this country.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; And the first to have an equal number of women and men in the Cabinet.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br><br>I’m enormously proud of this team.&nbsp; One person I’m particularly proud of is &#8212; was going to be introducing me &#8212; is Kamala Harris.&nbsp; But Kamala &#8212; (applause) &#8212; as I said, Kamala chose not to take a chance since her husband had contracted COVID, although he’s feeling very well, I’m told.<br><br>And, by the way, when he tested &#8212; he’s fine, but out of an abundance of caution, she decided she wasn’t going to join us today.&nbsp; But let’s send her our love because she’s something else.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>And I know how proud she is of our &#8212; our team:<br><br>Avril Haines &#8212; the first woman to lead our intelligence community as Director of National Intelligence.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Stand up, Avril.&nbsp; Come on.&nbsp; Stand up.&nbsp; She does everything in secret.&nbsp; That’s why she doesn’t want to stand up.&nbsp;<br><br>Former governor Jennifer Granholm, the Energy Department.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; I often kid her &#8212; and I wasn’t kidding early on when I seeking the nomination.&nbsp; Had she been born in America, she’d be standing here and I’d be sitting there.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; She’s the former governor of the state of Michigan.&nbsp; Michigan.&nbsp; Wrong.&nbsp; She was a former sta- &#8212; she was a governor.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; No, I’m teasing.&nbsp; But we often kidded about it.<br><br>And Isabel Guzman, the Small Business Administration.&nbsp; Where are you?&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Katherine Tai, U.S. Trade Representative.&nbsp; And she knows how to cut a deal.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>And Cece Rouse, Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>A number of members are not here today because they&#8217;re out traveling on behalf of the administration:<br><br>Jale- &#8212; Janet Yellen, the first female Secretary of the Treasury.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>Deb Haaland, the first Native American person in the Cabinet as Interior Secretary.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>Gina Raimondo, former governor, leading the Commerce Department.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>Marcia Fudge, Housing and Urban Development.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>If I stole any more members of Congress, I would’ve been in real trouble with Nancy.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;<br><br>And Shalanda Young, newly confirmed &#8212; (applause) &#8212; just minutes ago.&nbsp; Where is she?&nbsp; Shalanda, stand up.&nbsp; Where is Shalanda?&nbsp; Where &#8212; where are you?&nbsp; She &#8212; where is she?<br><br>I guess she&#8217;s not &#8212; okay.&nbsp; Lead the Office of Management and Budget.<br><br>And Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenhouse &#8212; -Greenfield, excuse me &#8212; who is at the United Nations and does an incredible job for us.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>And it’s not just the Cabinet.&nbsp; We have women in senior roles in every level here at the White House, across the administration, many of whom are here today.<br><br>And something I’m very proud of: I kept my commitment to be &#8212; nominate the first Black woman to the Supreme Court.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; And she&#8217;s really good.&nbsp;<br><br>And that’s not all.&nbsp; We have confirmed more Black women to the Circuit Court of Appeals than every previous administration combined.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; As a matter of fact, 75 percent of my judicial nominees are women.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>It matters.&nbsp; It matters.<br><br>Above all, we see the power of each and every one of you in the example that they, in fact, give the whole country.<br><br>You know, I want to thank you all for being here &#8212; at home and all those who are helping me around &#8212; helping the administration around the world.<br><br>It &#8212; that includes a special guest of the First Lady &#8212; and the First Lady of Iceland, Eliza Reid.&nbsp; Eliza, where are you?&nbsp;&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Stand up.&nbsp; Give her a big hand.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>She is a real champion for gender equality.&nbsp; We had a nice long talk.<br><br>Women’s History Month is an opportunity to honor the legacy, the vision, and the achievements of trailblazing women and girls who’ve built, shaped, and strengthened the character &#8212; the very character of this nation.<br><br>And despite hardships and exclusion and discrimination, women run the right &#8212; won the right to vote, campaigned against injustice, shattered countless barriers, and expanded the possibilities for all Americans.&nbsp; I think you underestimate all you’ve done.<br><br>They came before us and they&#8217;re all here &#8212; here today from all across the country as well, especially everyone who has gotten through this pandemic &#8212; frontline workers and service members, researchers and teachers &#8212; (applause) &#8212; caregivers, leaders in their communities.<br><br>And today I&#8217;m honored to be with some of the world’s greatest soccer players who happen to be women &#8212; (applause) &#8212; the U.S. Women’s National Team, both past and present.&nbsp;<br><br>Please &#8212; if I can ask you, come up on the stage.<br><br>I was going to have them stand, but if they stood, you couldn’t seem them anyway because everyone else is standing.&nbsp;<br><br>This is &#8212; they’ve won World Cups, the Olympics Gold Medal &#8212; Gold Medals, and, you know, for &#8212; after much, much too long, equal pay.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Equal pay.<br><br>Today is Equal Pay Day.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; And they just came from an event that discussed our administration’s effort to close the pay gap.&nbsp; So, thank you so much.&nbsp;&nbsp;(Applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp;And, by the way, you’re not only helping yourself, you’re helping us get it done for other women.</p>



<p>MS. CONE:&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you.&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.&nbsp;&nbsp;And that’s (inaudible).</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp;&nbsp;All right. &nbsp;Thank you.&nbsp;&nbsp;(Applause.)<br><br>And, look, we&#8217;re doing so by expanding access to good-paying jobs, lower costs for childcare and eldercare so women can get back to work and their families can have economic security.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And earlier today, I signed an executive order to promote efforts to achieve pay equality and pay equity for employees of federal contractors.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s my hope that this sets an example for all private companies to follow as well.&nbsp; That&#8217;s the purpose of what I did.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>Let me just close with this: Gender equality is not a woman&#8217;s issue alone; it benefits everybody.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s a fact.&nbsp; It benefits everyone &#8212; our society, our economy, and our country.</p>



<p>And I hope you&#8217;re able to walk through the wonderful exhibit we have downstairs celebrating Women&#8217;s History Month and the history of the journey of America.</p>



<p>Back in Fer- &#8212; back in February, I was in Lorain, Ohio, outside of Cleveland, to talk about a new infrastructure law that was going to transform our nation.&nbsp; It was the day before the birthday of Lorain&#8217;s most famous &#8212; one of her most famous daughters, Nobel Prize, Pulitzer Prize, No- &#8212; Nobel Prize winner, Pulitzer Prize winner, and one of Jill&#8217;s favorite authors, Toni Morrison.&nbsp; Toni is also &#8212; was also the mother-in-law of Dr. Rouse, one of our nation&#8217;s top economic thinkers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ms. Morrison left us words to live by.&nbsp; She said, “We&#8217;ve got more yesterdays than anybody.&nbsp; We need some kind of tomorrow.”&nbsp; “We need some kind of tomorrow.”</p>



<p>Downstairs is a display honoring Toni Morrison and that singular belief in tomorrow &#8212; that singular belief that America &#8212; in America, anything is possible.</p>



<p>I was once asked by Xi Jinping in China how &#8212; could I define America.  I said, “Yes.  In one word.”  God’s truth &#8212; one word: “Possibilities.”  We believe anything is possible in this country. <br><br>And that singular power of example shows our daughters, our granddaughters there’s not a single thing a man can do that a woman can’t do as well or better.<br><br>And, by the way, I can honestly say without fear of contradiction: From the time my daughter was born &#8212; our daughter was born &#8212; so, the time our four granddaughters were born &#8212; I&#8217;ve told them every day they could listen that there&#8217;s not a single thing they can&#8217;t do.  And I mean that from the bottom of my heart.  And they are living proof of that truth.<br><br>I want to start talking about my granddaughters now, if I can.  But &#8212; (laughter).<br><br>You know, especially the women I&#8217;m honored to introduce and who has more influence on them and has set an example that I think I&#8217;m just fortunate and they&#8217;re fortunate to have witnessed and be part of.<br><br>And with that, let me introduce the First Lady of the United States.  Before she comes up, I want you to know: Everybody knows I love her more than she loves me.  (Laughter.) I&#8217;m going to tell the story, Jill. <br><br>THE FIRST LADY:  No.  (Laughter.)<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:  I&#8217;m going to tell the story. <br><br>When we first got to the Vice President&#8217;s office, as those of you who are from Washington know, you walk down the steps of the Eisenhower Building, and you&#8217;re looking right into the Vice President&#8217;s office.  And the windows, I think, are 16 feet high and they have 12 big panes of glass, and four of them going across the office.  I think it&#8217;s four. <br><br>And &#8212; and so, Jill&#8217;s favorite day is &#8212; of the year is Valentine&#8217;s Day.  And so, she had gotten, as a professor &#8212; a teacher &#8212; she&#8217;s still teaching full-time &#8212; a teacher, she got that erasable paint you can, you know, use.  And she, on every window &#8212; every window &#8212; she got the maintenance guy to bring up a ladder.  And on every window, she put a big heart, and she said, “Joe loves Jill.”  (Laughter.)  Swear to God.  In every single window.  (Laughter.) <br><br>Well, my press person came to me &#8212; because she did it in the evening, and &#8212; and she &#8212; the night before Valentine&#8217;s Day.  And he said, “Look, they want you to go on CBS tomorrow morning and talk about Valentine&#8217;s Day.  We think you should do it.”  Now, her name &#8212; the interviewer is Juju Chang.  And Juju &#8212; we’re sitting there in the Vice President&#8217;s large office with all the shades pulled, in the dark, and just the lights on &#8212; you know, the Klieg lights.  And we&#8217;re about knee to knee.  And while we&#8217;re getting ready, Juju Chang looks at me and says, “You know, everybody says you and your wife have a great love affair going.”  I said, “I think so.”  I said, “But everybody knows I love her more than she loves me.”  And she looked at me straight in the eye &#8212; give you my word &#8212; and said, “That’s what they say.”  (Laughter.) <br><br>Ladies and gentlemen, the love of my life and the life of my love: Jill.  (Applause.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Indian Treaty Room<br>Eisenhower Executive Office Building</p>



<p>2:30 P.M. EDT</p>



<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Please &#8212; please, sit down.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, thank you, not only for being here but for what you did.</p>



<p>I want to thank the &#8212; Vice President Harris and the congressional leaders who are here today.</p>



<p>You know, in a moment, I’m going to sign this bipartisan government funding bill.&nbsp; But with this bill, we’re going to send a message to the American people &#8212; a strong message &#8212; that Democrats and Republicans can actually come together and get something done &#8212; right, Nance? &#8212; and to fulfill our most basic responsibilities: to keep the government open and running for the American people, serving the American people, investing in your communities and investing in the American people, and doing it in a fiscally responsible way.</p>



<p>This bill also includes historic funding &#8212; $13.6 billion &#8212; to address Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the impact on surrounding countries.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>Putin’s aggression against Ukraine has united people all across America, united our two parties in Congress, and united freedom-loving world.&nbsp; And this &#8212; and it’s an act with urgency and resolve that we’re doing right now that you’ve provided me the ability to &#8212; to do.</p>



<p>I want to thank the congressional leadership for working so quickly to &#8212; to make sure we have the resources we need &#8212; economic, humanitarian, and security &#8212; to continue our forceful response to this crisis.</p>



<p>We’ve already committed more than 1 billion 200 million dollars in security assistance to the people of Ukraine just over the past year.  And I &#8212; I know all of you know that; it’s preaching to the choir here.<br><br>     But we’ve been providing anti-armor &#8212; taking out tanks &#8212; air &#8212; anti-air capabilities directly &#8212; directly to the Ukrainian forces.  And we’re also facilitating significant shipments of security assistance from our Allied partners to Ukraine.</p>



<p>With this &#8212; with this new security funding and the drawdown authorities in this bill, we’re remo- &#8212; we’re moving urgently to further augment the support to the brave people of Ukraine as they defend their country.</p>



<p>And I’ll have much more to say about this tomorrow &#8212; about exactly what we’re doing in Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We&#8217;re also going to be better positioned to provide for the rapidly growing humanitarian needs of the Ukrainian people.<br><br>     This war has turned nearly 3 million Ukrainians into refugees, with numbers growing every single day.  And that&#8217;s on top of the 12 million people who require humanitarian assistance inside of Ukraine.<br><br>     The United States is helping to lead the global humanitarian response with our partners in Europe and well beyond Europe.<br><br>     In just the past few weeks, we provided nearly $293 million in humanitarian assistance to people in Ukraine and in neighboring countries.<br><br>     Our experts are on the ground in Poland and in neighboring countries, where the Vice President just came back from, to make real-time assessments of a rapidly evolving crisis, to get urgently needed humanitarian supplies to the people in need now.<br><br>     We&#8217;re airlifting emergency relief supplies into staging positions in the region &#8212; supplies like high-thermal blankets, water treatment equipment &#8212; so that they can be shipped into Ukraine.<br><br>     We&#8217;re providing essentials like soap and laundry detergent &#8212; simple-sounding things &#8212; to refugees who fled with literally nothing but the clothing on their backs.<br><br>     We&#8217;re working with partners to supply access to safe drinking water and to food rations to the people affected by this conflict.<br><br>     With U.S. support, the World Food Programme has already purchased 20,000 metric tons of food to address the growing needs of individuals affected by this conflict.<br><br>     It&#8217;s exceedingly difficult to get supplies into Ukraine while the Russian onslaught continues.  But we&#8217;re managing to get supplies into Ukraine regularly thanks to the bravery of so many frontline workers who are still at their post.  And we are supporting food assistance at refugee reception centers in frontline countries like Moldova.<br><br>     With billions more included in this bill for new humanitarian assistance, we&#8217;re going to be able to quickly ramp up our response and help alleviate the suffering that Putin&#8217;s war is causing the Ukrainian people in the region.<br><br>     This bill also provides necessary economic support for Ukraine and Ukraine’s neighbors that are impacted by this war &#8212; things like loan guarantees, direct financial support, including &#8212; including to address the needs like energy and cybersecurity.<br><br>     This bill is also going to help face our &#8212; our challenges here at home.  It sends a clear message to the American people that we&#8217;re investing in safety, health, and the future of Americans.<br><br>     Let me just mention a couple of highlights, starting with community safety.  We know what works to make our communities safer, and that&#8217;s investing in prevention and community police officers so that they can walk the streets, know the neighborhoods, and who can help restore trust and safety in the communities.<br><br>     The answer is not to abandon our streets or to choose between safety and equal justice.  It&#8217;s in funding &#8212; it&#8217;s in this funding bill, which we make sure we do both.<br><br>     This budget invests in funding for agencies like the FBI and U.S. Marshals and the Drug Enforcement Agency, but it also includes funding for COPS programs to increase community policing and the ability of the Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms tackle &#8212; to tackle gun crime.  And it funds entirely new community violence intervention programs just at the Department of Justice.<br><br>     Community violence interruption programs are programs where trusted community members work directly with the people who are most likely to commit or become victims of gun crimes.  I had a chance to meet with those leaders in one of the programs in New York City not long ago.  I saw the difference they were making every day.<br><br>     We know these programs can dramatically reduce violence, and we&#8217;re going to fund a lot more of them.<br><br>     This bill also includes grants for state and local law enforcement and crime prevention programs.  We&#8217;re talking about drug treatment programs, school violence prevention programs, programs where people who might end up in prison and instead get mandatory mental healthcare that they need.  Part of the saf- &#8212; before any crime was committed.<br><br>     Part of the safety is the ability to feel safe in gender-based &#8212; from gender-based violence. <a> I wrote a Violence Against Women Act with many in this room years ago &#8212; 28 years ago &#8212; </a>to provide protection against domestic violence, stalking, sexual assault, and to support survivors and help them find a way out of those abusive situations they were locked into because they had no means to leave, with support for race cri- &#8212; rape crip- &#8212; crisis centers, as well as housing and legal assistance. </p>



<p>The law has saved lives, and that&#8217;s helped women rebuild their lives and make children a heck of a lot safer.</p>



<p>Today, with this bill, we reauthorize and strengthen the Violence Against Women Act.&nbsp; For example &#8212; (applause).</p>



<p>For example, we&#8217;re doing more to help survivor &#8212; survivors in rural areas and in underserved communities.&nbsp; Tribal courts will now be able to exercise jurisdiction over non-Native perpetrators of sexual assault and sex trafficking.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re providing more support for legal services and for law enforcement to get the training they need to help handle the trauma survivors are experiencing.</p>



<p>Now, I’ll have more to say about the Violence Against Women Act tomorrow as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And we&#8217;re going to be able to fund significant areas of common ground in this bill, especially in areas that I &#8212; that I called in my State of the Union address a “Unity Agenda” &#8212; the things that we can accomplish together, Democrats and Republicans.</p>



<p>Two elements of that agenda are, one, beat the opioid epidemic and, two, take on the challenges of mental health, which have been exacerbated because of the COVID problem.</p>



<p>This bill supports opioid response grants that are funding that we provide to states to support opioid prevent &#8212; opioid prevention, treatment, and recovery services.</p>



<p>We also included funding for states in support of mental health services, as well as additional funding for children&#8217;s mental health services, which has increased exponentially.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve also called for increasing Pell grants to make colleges more affordable, and that is: Anyone making less than $50,000 a year, they&#8217;re eligible for a Pell grant.&nbsp; This bill delivers increasing the maximum Pell grant by $400, which will make a difference in a lot of lives.</p>



<p>Now, I would like to add a word about another investment this bill makes, one that I expect will pay dividends for hope, healing, and for our economy for generations to come.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s called ARPA-H &#8212; Advanced Research Project Agencies of Health.&nbsp; This will be a new kind of entity, an engine for innovation, a place where we&#8217;ll do high-risk, high-reward research that can drive unprecedented progress in biomedicine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s based on DARPA, the Defense Department&#8217;s Advanced Research Project Agency, that has led to breakthroughs in technologies that protect our national security, like the Internet, GPS, and so much more.</p>



<p>ARPA-H will have a singular purpose: to drive breakthroughs to prevent, detect, and treat diseases including cancer, Alzheimer&#8217;s, and diabetes, and other diseases.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, by the way, we&#8217;re providing that we can &#8212; and we&#8217;re proving that we can invest in the American people in a fiscally responsible way.</p>



<p>Last year, the deficit dropped for the first time since 2015.&nbsp; It fell by $360 billion last year.&nbsp; And this year, it&#8217;s on track to drop by more than $1 trillion.&nbsp; After four years in a row of increasing deficits before I took office, we&#8217;re now on a track to see the largest-ever decline in the deficit in American history.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>So let me close with this: Today, we&#8217;re again showing the American people that, as a country, we can come together as Democrats, Republicans, and independents and do big things; that our democracy can deliver &#8212; can deliver &#8212; and outperform autocracies; and that there&#8217;s nothing we can&#8217;t do when we do it together as the United States of America.</p>



<p>So I&#8217;d like to now invite up my Budget Director, Shalanda Young, and all the members of the Congress here today while we sign this bipartisan government funding bill.</p>



<p>Thank you all very much.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>Speaker, there you go.&nbsp; Now, I know we usually hand out pens to everyone who’s done this, but you’re all going to get a pen, but we didn’t have 18 &#8212; 15 pens up here.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; So I’m going to make sure you get it when we finish.</p>



<p>SENATOR LEAHY:&nbsp; I wanted to make sure that my signature was legible.</p>

<p>Last Friday marked one year since President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan into law. This historic legislation drove our economic recovery, helped students safely return to their classrooms, and allowed Americans to get back to work. Moody’s estimates that 4 million of the 7.4 million jobs created in the first year of the Biden-Harris Administration would not exist without the American Rescue Plan. Notably, since January 2021, we have created 467,000 jobs at the state and local levels and education jobs experienced the best growth on record.</p>



<p>State, local, and tribal leaders applauded the legislation today.</p>



<p><em>See below for what they’re saying:</em></p>



<p><strong><em>Governors</em></strong></p>



<p><strong>Alabama Governor Kay Ivey:</strong> “With the support of the Alabama Legislature, I’m proud to award $10 million of the State Fiscal Recovery Fund from the American Rescue Plan Act to establish COVID recovery grants for volunteer fire departments. #alpolitics” [<a href="https://twitter.com/GovernorKayIvey/status/1500865770330464257">Tweet</a>, 3/7/22]</p>



<p><strong>Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont</strong>: &#8220;Nearly one year after the American Rescue Plan passed, its positive impact is still felt in CT. Thank you to @POTUS and our congressional delegation for providing the resources to keep kids safely in school while uplifting workers and businesses during the darkest days of Covid.&#8221; [<a href="https://twitter.com/GovNedLamont/status/1501339792122040322">Tweet</a>, 3/8/22]</p>



<p><strong>Nevada Governor Sisolak</strong>: &#8220;One year ago, with the support of @SenCortezMasto, @SenJackyRosen, @repdinatitus, @RepHorsford and @RepSusieLee the #AmericanRescuePlan became law. These funds supported the COVID response &amp; we’re laser focused on investing in critical issues for Nevadans, like housing.&#8221; [<a href="https://twitter.com/GovSisolak/status/1502382779597680640">Tweet</a>, 3/11/22]</p>



<p><strong>New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham</strong>: &#8220;A year ago today @POTUS enacted the #AmericanRescuePlan, delivering billions to support New Mexico. ARPA has made possible innovative investments in programs that reduce costs and build a stronger foundation for New Mexico families, including a historic expansion of child care&#8230; We enacted the single largest eligibility expansion in the history of New Mexico&#8217;s child care assistance program, supporting tens of thousands more families. And we delivered $157 million to over 1,000 childcare businesses across the state, supporting providers &amp; increasing pay.&#8221; [<a href="https://twitter.com/GovMLG/status/1502355239344930817?cxt=HHwWgoDQ-auIuNkpAAAA">Tweet</a>, 3/11/22]</p>



<p><strong>Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf</strong>: &#8220;One year ago, the American Rescue Plan became law — sending Pennsylvania $13.72 billion to help us recover from the pandemic. Thank you to @POTUS and the federal lawmakers who made this plan happen. This support has been critical to our recovery&#8230; [<a href="https://twitter.com/GovernorTomWolf/status/1502268357520859136">Tweet thread</a>, 3/11/22]<strong></strong></p>



<p><strong>Vermont Governor Phil Scott</strong>: &#8220;Last year, using American Rescue Plan and state funds, we invested almost $100M for housing. With much more underway, we’ve already: • Added 800 homes • Are building 800 more • Helped over 1,300 families transition out of homelessness … This is important, but it’s not been enough to help Vermonters find affordable housing. The good news is, we have 100s of millions in ARPA funds to continue this progress. We have to act now and need legislative support to pass this year’s $145M proposed housing investment.2/2&#8221; [<a href="https://twitter.com/GovPhilScott/status/1502037050874343432">Tweet</a>, 3/11/22]</p>



<p><strong><em>Mayors</em></strong></p>



<p><strong>Albany Mayor Kathy Sheehan</strong>: &#8220;Today is the one-year anniversary of the #AmericanRescuePlan.

<p><strong>Albuquerque</strong><strong> Mayor Tim Keller: </strong>“…[ARPA] was a game-changer…especially [for] Albuquerque, because we could use it right away, and we could use it in the way we thought was best for our city… It remains to me the most helpful federal incentive or action that I’ve ever dealt with as a mayor.” [<a href="https://www.usmayors.org/2022/03/09/one-year-after-american-rescue-plan-mayors-offer-testimonials-about-importance-of-direct-local-relief-dollars/">Statement</a>, 3/9/22] <strong></strong></p>



<p><strong>Akron Mayor Dan Horrigan</strong>: “The ARPA funds are already making a big impact here in Akron. We recently announced over $1.3 million in grants to 11 local organizations working to prevent violence from occurring, stop the progression of violence, and rehabilitate individuals with a history of violent behavior. I believe it is our duty and responsibility to support organizations that are offering evidence-based programming to create a safer community, and the American Rescue Plan funding gives us the opportunity to do just that.” [<a href="https://ohiomayorsalliance.org/clips/one-year-of-arpa-what-ohios-mayors-are-saying/">Tweet</a>, 3/10/22]</p>



<p><strong>Augusta</strong><strong> Mayor Hardie Davis Jr.: </strong>“We know best how to distribute those dollars, how to meet the needs of people on the ground. And that was the key element that made these dollars so instrumental in coming to us at the time that they did. In Augusta, we used them for a number of things. Some challenges that we had, particularly in terms of law enforcement, being able to keep people – from a public safety and law enforcement perspective – on the ground.” [<a href="https://www.usmayors.org/2022/03/09/one-year-after-american-rescue-plan-mayors-offer-testimonials-about-importance-of-direct-local-relief-dollars/">Statement</a>, 3/9/22] <strong></strong></p>

<p><strong>Burnsville</strong><strong> Mayor Elizabeth Kautz: </strong>“Now for ARPA funds, because we only got about $8 million in my city, and so what we used the first $6 million is for cost recovery for lost revenue… I have a power plant [and natural gas plant] in my city, so we have some very critical assets. We need to make sure that we have those assets still running, because all of us, all of us, need electric power.” [<a href="https://www.usmayors.org/2022/03/09/one-year-after-american-rescue-plan-mayors-offer-testimonials-about-importance-of-direct-local-relief-dollars/">Statement</a>, 3/9/22] <strong></strong></p>



<p><strong>Cleveland Mayor Justin Bibb:</strong> “We received over $511 million dollars from President Biden through the American Rescue Plan… and I’m using that capital to do a couple things: number one, we’ve already authorized over $20 million to eradicate the digital divide, we’ve raised already over $100 million to eradicate the lead paint crisis…[and] I intend to launch an Office of Economic Recovery working with public and private partners from all across our community to make sure we can leverage this capital to truly create the right recovery that can be an inclusive economic comeback for our city in the future.” [<a href="https://www.usmayors.org/2022/03/09/one-year-after-american-rescue-plan-mayors-offer-testimonials-about-importance-of-direct-local-relief-dollars/">Statement</a>, 3/9/22] <strong></strong></p>



<p><strong>Columbus Mayor Andrew Ginther: </strong>“ICYMI: On Monday, the city and county announced $8M from the American Rescue Plan for small businesses in underserved communities led by minority, women and veteran entrepreneurs… These funds would not have been possible without the American Rescue Plan, which tomorrow celebrates its one-year anniversary. #ARPA @usmayors #Columbus #community” [<a href="https://twitter.com/MayorGinther/status/1502043168119959564">Tweet</a>, 3/10/22]</p>



<p><strong>Dayton Mayor Jeffrey J. Mims, Jr: </strong>A year ago today, @POTUS signed the #AmericanRescuePlan into law.

<p><strong>Denver Mayor Michael Hancock: </strong>“So, ARPA helped us to begin to restore those critical services and bring back our employees — everyone was furloughed for the most part, except for our uniforms…Then, we began to restore and invest in our businesses, in our community-based organizations so that they could also be responsive to our community. And we really heavily invested in housing and shelter, particularly for our most vulnerable — our homeless.” [<a href="https://www.usmayors.org/2022/03/09/one-year-after-american-rescue-plan-mayors-offer-testimonials-about-importance-of-direct-local-relief-dollars/">Statement</a>, 3/9/22] <strong></strong></p>



<p><strong>Des Moines</strong><strong> Mayor Frank Cownie: </strong>“A lot of these people started working virtually. Well, what does that do to all those businesses you know whether they’re restaurants or retail or whatever that people are starting to not frequent? And so they started laying people off, and in some cases shutting down because their workers became ill with the pandemic and COVID. And so there were lots of people that needed a lot of help. And you know they were having to try to keep a roof over their heads, make rental payments, make house payments, put food on the table.” [<a href="https://www.usmayors.org/2022/03/09/one-year-after-american-rescue-plan-mayors-offer-testimonials-about-importance-of-direct-local-relief-dollars/">Statement</a>, 3/9/22] <strong></strong></p>

<p><strong>Edina</strong><strong> Mayor Jim Hovland: </strong>“We thought we had great broadband coverage in our community, but we found out there were blind spots, bad spots for kids, so we dedicated $500,000 of that 2.4 million… [so] that they’d have the kind of access to the internet we wanted them to have… In the aftermath of the killing of George Floyd, we set up… the use of a social worker to help on some police calls where officers were being asked to cover mental health challenges… We committed about $400,000 of that [ARPA] money to enhancing that operation within our police department and also assisting our school district and our community with some outside mental health services, either for kids or families that need some assistance.” [<a href="https://www.usmayors.org/2022/03/09/one-year-after-american-rescue-plan-mayors-offer-testimonials-about-importance-of-direct-local-relief-dollars/">Statement</a>, 3/9/22] <strong></strong></p>



<p><strong>Finley</strong><strong> Mayor Christina Muryn</strong>: “With the American Rescue Plan dollars, we are being able to provide some grant opportunities to support our nonprofits in a variety of ways, certainly focusing on basic needs: food, housing, education, getting folks back to work, and childcare… [including] things like Cancer Patient Services, an organization that helps individuals who are struggling with medical bills while going through cancer treatment, or Hope House, which helps individuals that have been displaced or are seeking refuge from domestic violence.” [<a href="https://www.usmayors.org/2022/03/09/one-year-after-american-rescue-plan-mayors-offer-testimonials-about-importance-of-direct-local-relief-dollars/">Statement</a>, 3/9/22] <strong></strong></p>



<p><strong>Fremont</strong><strong> Mayor Lily Mei</strong>: “Having that ability to leverage and utilize ARPA to balance our budget allowed us to then focus some of those funds, along with the combination of county and state, to help with rental assistance. As of January to date, we have used almost $11 million of our $16 million to help provide rental assistance for over 770 families.” [<a href="https://www.usmayors.org/2022/03/09/one-year-after-american-rescue-plan-mayors-offer-testimonials-about-importance-of-direct-local-relief-dollars/">Statement</a>, 3/9/22] <strong></strong></p>

Janet Yellen to participate in a news conference with local leaders from around the nation about the American Rescue Plan&#8230; I joined the news conference to demonstrate the importance of these dollars in our community that will enhance our public safety efforts, address our homeless population, and invest in underserved neighborhoods. I also talked about the impact on our business community and the much-needed relief provided to our struggling small businesses, especially restaurants.&#8221; [<a href="https://twitter.com/MayorJerryDyer/status/1501657438553968642">Tweet</a>, 3/9/22]</p>



<p><strong>Grand Rapids Mayor Rosalynn Bliss, Chair Urban Core Mayors</strong>: “Michigan’s urban core cities were at the heart of the state’s pandemic response… One year ago, the American Rescue Plan Act gave us hope that there was light at the end of the tunnel. This federal stimulus is allowing our cities to emerge from the pandemic on a stronger footing by using these funds to help build up our small businesses and refill out downtowns. We are also able to strategically invest in core issues like housing and infrastructure so that our children can see the benefit of these funds long into the future.” [Statement, 3/11/22]</p>



<p><strong>Grove City Mayor Richard L. “Ike” Stage</strong>: “The ARPA stimulus has been a tremendous help for our community The funds were vital to the repair and update of our aging stormwater sewer infrastructure in our older neighborhoods.” [<a href="https://ohiomayorsalliance.org/clips/one-year-of-arpa-what-ohios-mayors-are-saying/">Tweet</a>, 3/10/22]</p>



<p><strong>Hallandale Beach</strong><strong> Mayor Joy Cooper</strong>: “Once we did all those calculations, we saw that within two-to-three years, the rate we were going, facing COVID closing businesses, all the other stresses and having to keep employees well and keep them paid, we were facing bankruptcy. So without the support of the federal government — which all our residents are very grateful for — as a smaller city, we really were facing really dire times, so we have really applied every, every penny of ARPA to make sure that we can balance our budget.” [<a href="https://www.usmayors.org/2022/03/09/one-year-after-american-rescue-plan-mayors-offer-testimonials-about-importance-of-direct-local-relief-dollars/">Statement</a>, 3/9/22] <strong></strong></p>



<p><strong>Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner: </strong>“We stood to lose or lay off nearly 2,000 employees if it were not for CARES funding and then the ARPA funding. It was just that bad. It would have forced us to lay off municipal workers… It was the ARPA funding that was primarily used to plug that $200 million shortfall… Do you want to lose police officers? The answer is ‘no.’ Do you want to lose firefighters? The answer is ‘no’.’ Do you need your solid waste workers, the people who pick up the trash every week? The answer is ‘absolutely’… You take away the people, you take away the services.” [<a href="https://www.usmayors.org/2022/03/09/one-year-after-american-rescue-plan-mayors-offer-testimonials-about-importance-of-direct-local-relief-dollars/">Statement</a>, 3/9/22] <strong></strong></p>



<p><strong>Huntington Mayor Steve Williams: </strong>“We put together an extremely aggressive [economic revitalization] plan… I just knew what we had to do in order to transform our community. It had to be something that was bigger than what any small town would imagine doing. But the only way you’re going to do that within a shortened time frame is it has to be big. Go big or don’t go… The big worry that I had was ‘how in God’s name am I going to pay for this.”… And then the Rescue Plan came.” [<a href="https://www.usmayors.org/2022/03/09/one-year-after-american-rescue-plan-mayors-offer-testimonials-about-importance-of-direct-local-relief-dollars/">Statement</a>, 3/9/22] <strong></strong></p>

<p><strong>Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas: </strong>“…There is an organization in Kansas City called the KC Care Clinic. Their primary work…is working with people who are living with HIV and AIDS. And, early in the pandemic, of course, immunocompromised folks are an area of concern. Our ability to support KC Care through our federal funds has been a lifesaver for a lot of these folks, who, as I noted, weren’t going to the doctor for a while, didn’t know what part of society they could engage with, making sure they had access and consistent treatment throughout this crisis.” [<a href="https://www.usmayors.org/2022/03/09/one-year-after-american-rescue-plan-mayors-offer-testimonials-about-importance-of-direct-local-relief-dollars/">Statement</a>, 3/9/22] <strong></strong></p>



<p><strong>Lancaster Mayor David Scheffler: </strong>“The timing of these funds was important as we were able to quickly invest in a major water infrastructure project that was key to finalizing a significant economic development project for the region. These infrastructure investments can be very costly for cities but are vital to the lon-term success of our communities.” [<a href="https://ohiomayorsalliance.org/clips/one-year-of-arpa-what-ohios-mayors-are-saying/">Statement</a>, 3/11/22]</p>



<p><strong>Lakewood Mayor Meghan George</strong>: “The City of Lakewood received $47 million from the American Rescue Plan Act. More than half of those dollars will be spent on necessary improvements to our century old water/sewer infrastructure. This allows for rate reductions for every resident and business owner in our city. Additionally, we have allocated roughly $1.6 million towards homelessness prevention. We continue to explore other uses for these dollars that will make the most impact for our community.” [<a href="https://ohiomayorsalliance.org/clips/one-year-of-arpa-what-ohios-mayors-are-saying/">Tweet</a>, 3/10/22]</p>



<p><strong>Lincoln</strong><strong> Mayor Leirion Gaylor Baird</strong>: “We used our American Rescue Plan funds, first and foremost, to help stabilize small businesses in Lincoln. We’ve allocated over $7 million in grants to small businesses… provide up to six months of rent and mortgage payments… And through our exit interviews with recipients of these funds, we’ve heard that this is what helped keep them in business. This is what’s helping keep people employed who work in their companies. We’ve helped over 250 small businesses and micro businesses with those dollars from the American Rescue Plan. It really has been a lifeline for them.” [<a href="https://www.usmayors.org/2022/03/09/one-year-after-american-rescue-plan-mayors-offer-testimonials-about-importance-of-direct-local-relief-dollars/">Statement</a>, 3/9/22] <strong></strong></p>



<p><strong>Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti</strong>: &#8220;On this day, a year ago, Congress passed the American Rescue Plan — a turning point for the country, and today Los Angeles is stronger for it. An extraordinary crisis demands an extraordinary response, Los Angeles could not have asked for a better partner than @POTUS.&#8221; [<a href="https://twitter.com/MayorOfLA/status/1501610051609378818">Tweet</a>, 3/9/22]&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Louisville</strong><strong> Mayor Greg Fischer: </strong>“First and foremost, the ARPA funds were used to make sure that we could mitigate the impact of the pandemic as much as we possibly could. It literally was a lifesaver for our community. And then when you go beyond that to the type of economic uplift that ARPA has provided, and will provide even further, it allowed us to address challenges in our community that we’ve always dreamed of addressing, but we never had the resources to address. So it gives us the double impact of economic lift, and then also taking on big challenges for generational change in Louisville.” [<a href="https://www.usmayors.org/2022/03/09/one-year-after-american-rescue-plan-mayors-offer-testimonials-about-importance-of-direct-local-relief-dollars/">Statement</a>, 3/9/22] <strong></strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>South Court Auditorium</em></p>



<p>3:01 P.M. EST<br><br>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Good afternoon, everyone.&nbsp; Good afternoon.&nbsp;<br><br>Jen Klein, thank you for the introduction and mostly for the work that you do every day, tirelessly, as the Director of our Gender Policy Council.<br><br>And to the members of Congress, members of our administration, business leaders, community leaders, and equal pay advocates who are here with us virtually and in person, thank you for your leadership, for your partnership, and for your commitment to action every day.<br><br>So, I&#8217;ll begin with a simple truth: Our economy just has not been working as it should for the women of our nation.&nbsp; Across industries, women are less likely to be hired than equally qualified men.&nbsp; They are paid less and promoted slower for doing similar work.&nbsp; Women are routinely shut out of good jobs in high-paying industries &#8212; such as science and technology, construction, and truck driving &#8212; in part because our society tells women that some industries are just not for them.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;And as study after study has shown, women are expected to shoulder an unequal share of unpaid caregiving responsibilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When families cannot afford or cannot find caregiving &#8212; such as childcare, eldercare, or home care &#8212; it often falls on women to fill the gaps, whether that means going part-time or leaving the workforce entirely or working full time at a paid job and full time performing unpaid caregiving.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>And over the past two years, the pandemic has only deepened these inequities as caregiving has become more expensive and more difficult to find.<br><br>And here&#8217;s how that all adds up: Today, on average, working women who are working full time, year-round, make just 83 cents for every dollar that a man makes.&nbsp;<br><br>And for many women of color, the gap is even wider.&nbsp; Over a 40-year career, a woman will lose out on about $400,000.&nbsp; For Black women, Latina women, Native American women, that loss in wages is closer to $1 million.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>And of course, that is money that a woman could use to pay off her student loan debt or put a down payment on a house or pay a mortgage or invest in a small business or save for retirement.&nbsp;<br><br>As one must recognize, lower wages mean working women have less money &#8212; less money to save today.&nbsp;&nbsp; And lower wages mean they receive lower Social Security benefits in their senior years.<br><br>For so many women, the gender wage gap acts as a virtual tax, making it so much more difficult to pay the bills and invest in their future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It can also have a negative impact on their productivity, job satisfaction, and retention.&nbsp;&nbsp; And by extension, it can have a negative impact on individual businesses and on our economy as a whole.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>As the business leaders here today will tell us, closing the gender wage gap &#8212; well, it&#8217;s not just a moral issue, it&#8217;s also a business one.<br><br>If we are going to continue to grow our economy and to be competitive and lead the world in the 21st century, we simply cannot afford to leave half of our workforce behind.&nbsp; To build an economy that works for all of us, we must build an economy that works for women.&nbsp;<br><br>That is one of our administration’s central missions.&nbsp;&nbsp; And that has been a central mission of mine for quite some time.&nbsp; In fact, when I served in the United States Senate, I introduced what we named the Domestic Workers Bill of Rights Act to ensure that domestic workers &#8212; 90 percent of whom are women &#8212; that they are paid fairly and that their rights are protected.<br><br>And, with Senator Patty Murray of Washington and Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro, I co-sponsored the Paycheck Fairness Act to make it easier for employees to bring equal pay claims against their employers.<br><br>And over the past year, our administration has taken important action to address the gender wage gap.&nbsp; We passed the American Rescue Plan, which provided immediate relief to millions of women who were severely impacted by the pandemic.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>We passed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which is creating good-paying, good union jobs, including for many women in industries where they are underrepresented, such as transportation, clean energy, and construction.<br><br>Today, we are taking additional steps to help increase pay equity across our nation.&nbsp;<br><br>One factor that contributes to pay inequity is the common practice of requiring job applicants to share their salary history.<br><br>Now, think about that.&nbsp; Why does that matter?&nbsp; Well, in effect, it&#8217;s allowing how much an employee was been paid in the past to impact how much they will be paid in the future.<br><br>So, think about that.&nbsp; For many women, this practice can mean that inequitable pay from a previous job will follow them to the current job, and so on, and so on.<br><br>So, our administration is committed to eliminating discriminatory pay practices that inhibit the economy, efficiency, and effectiveness of the federal government.&nbsp;<br><br>And that&#8217;s why today, our Office of Personnel Management will begin work to address the use of salary history in the hiring and pay-setting process for federal employees.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>And today, the President, Joe Biden, will sign an executive order that directs the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council to consider limiting the use of salary history in employment decisions by federal contractors.&nbsp;<br><br>In addition, today, our Department of Labor will direct federal contractors to strengthen pay audits.&nbsp; Pay audits help organizations determine whether they are paying all their employees equitably and, if they are not, give them data to help correct that inequity.&nbsp;<br><br>The President and I firmly believe that all companies should conduct these audits and, where appropriate, should be transparent about the results.&nbsp; By the way, I think it&#8217;s always appropriate to be transparent about the results.&nbsp; Because pay transparency creates accountability.&nbsp;&nbsp; And accountability &#8212; well, that drives progress.<br><br>Our administration cannot bridge the wage gap alone.&nbsp;&nbsp; It will truly take all of us, working together.&nbsp;<br><br>And&nbsp;that is why we are gathered here today at this summit.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We can build a more fair, more efficient, and more equitable economy &#8212; as I said and truly believe, an economy that works for women and for everyone.&nbsp; That&#8217;s how it goes: An economy that works for women works for everyone.<br><br>And so, together, we will continue to do this good work.&nbsp; I thank you all &#8212; all the leaders who are here.&nbsp; And let us continue with this important work until we truly reach a place where all workers and all people are treated fairly.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; END&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3:09 P.M.

<p>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Section 1.  Policy. </span> It is the policy of my Administration to eliminate discriminatory pay practices that inhibit the economy, efficiency, and effectiveness of the Federal workforce and the procurement of property and services by the Federal Government.  The Office of Personnel Management anticipates issuing a proposed rule that will address the use of salary history in the hiring and pay-setting processes for Federal employees, consistent with Executive Order 14035 of June 25, 2021 (Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility in the Federal Workforce).  The purpose of this order is to direct the consideration of parallel efforts with respect to Federal procurement.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 2.  Economy, Efficiency, and Effectiveness in Federal Procurement.  </span>Consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations, the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council, in consultation with the Secretary of Labor and the heads of other executive departments and agencies as appropriate, shall consider issuing proposed rules to promote economy, efficiency, and effectiveness in Federal procurement by enhancing pay equity and transparency for job applicants and employees of Federal contractors and subcontractors.  In doing so, the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council shall specifically consider whether any such rules should limit or prohibit Federal contractors and subcontractors from seeking and considering information about job applicants&#8217; and employees&#8217; existing or past compensation when making employment decisions.  The Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council shall also consider the inclusion of appropriate accountability measures in any such rules.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 3.  General Provisions.  </span>(a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:</p>



<p>(i)&nbsp;&nbsp; the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or</p>



<p>(ii)&nbsp; the functions of the Director of the Office of&nbsp;Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.</p>



<p>(b)&nbsp; This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.</p>



<p>(c)&nbsp; This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.</p>

<p>Today, Director of the National Economic Council Brian Deese and Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg met with key stakeholders in the country’s goods movement supply chain to launch a new initiative that will help to speed up the movement of goods, reducing delays and costs for American consumers. &nbsp;</p>



<p>NEC and DOT leaders discussed with port directors and business leaders the value of the new initiative. Freight Logistics Optimization Works (FLOW), an information sharing initiative to pilot key freight information exchange between parts of the supply chain. This commitment to moving the transportation logistics system to 21<sup>st</sup> century digitization follows the commitment to move toward 24/7 operations many made last fall.</p>



<p>Participants discussed the progress made to date in working collaboratively across private sector stakeholders and with federal and state governments to address supply chain bottlenecks at ports including the decline in long-term dwelling containers (by 60% at the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach since November), a reduction in empty containers (by more than 30% at the Port of Los Angeles since the beginning of the year), and the creation of pop-up sites for containers around the Port of Savannah. In particular, participants discussed the success of pop-up sites at restoring fluidity over the past year and how they will be needed in the future.</p>



<p>They underscored the value of greater data transparency across the supply chain and how this would benefit not only their respective companies but also the system more broadly, cutting waste and reducing costs for consumers. Participants acknowledged the current system is underperforming and needs greater investment and more collaboration in creating ship to shelf visibility into the primarily private-sector owned supply chain. A more reliable, predictable, and accurate information exchange about goods movement is the hallmark of a globally competitive 21<sup>st</sup> century goods movement chain and is especially important for small- and medium-sized businesses who lack visibility into the current system. Participants highlighted that this type of digital infrastructure was more important than ever in the face of supply chain disruptions caused by global events like the pandemic and Russia’s unprovoked aggression in Ukraine.</p>



<p><strong>Here’s what industry leaders across the supply chain are saying about this critical initiative: </strong><a href="https://www.transportation.gov/briefing-room/industry-leaders-endorse-biden-harris-administration-initiative-improve-supply-0">https://www.transportation.gov/briefing-room/industry-leaders-endorse-biden-harris-administration-initiative-improve-supply-0</a></p>

<p>After serving as the second-in-command at Treasury and with prior service on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, Sarah Bloom Raskin knows better than anyone how important the Federal Reserve is to fighting inflation and continuing a sustainable economic recovery. She has unparalleled experience pursuing solutions to enhance our country’s critical financial infrastructure, with expertise in cybersecurity and climate risk, and protecting consumers in the financial marketplace.</p>



<p>Sarah’s nomination had broad support—from the banking and financial services community, former members of the Board of Governors, multiple Nobel Prize winners, consumer advocates, and respected economists from around the country. That experience and support are among the many reasons why I nominated Sarah to be the Vice Chair for Supervision, a critical role in regulating our nation’s financial institutions.</p>



<p>Despite her readiness—and despite having been confirmed by the Senate with broad, bipartisan support twice in the past—Sarah was subject to baseless attacks from industry and conservative interest groups. Unfortunately, Senate Republicans are more focused on amplifying these false claims and protecting special interests than taking important steps toward addressing inflation and lowering costs for the American people.</p>



<p>I am grateful for Sarah’s service to our country and for her willingness to serve again, and I look forward to her future contributions to our country.</p>



<p>I urge the Senate Banking Committee to move swiftly to confirm the four eminently qualified nominees for the Board of Governors—Jerome Powell, Lael Brainard, Philip Jefferson, and Lisa Cook—who are still waiting for an up-or-down vote. This group has the experience, judgment, and talent necessary to lead the Federal Reserve at this critical moment in our economic recovery, and the Senate should move their nominations forward.</p>
