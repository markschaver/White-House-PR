<p class="has-text-align-center">James S. Brady Press Briefing Room</p>



<p>3:07 P.M. EDT<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Hi, everyone.&nbsp; Okay, I have no toppers today.&nbsp; Don’t be so disappointed.&nbsp; And I know we have a hard out for some people to gather, so we will all keep you updated on when that needs to happen.<br>&nbsp;<br>But, Zeke, why don’t you kick us off?<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; Just two quick.&nbsp; The President put out a statement this morning on the prisoner swap for the release of Trevor Reed.&nbsp; And he called it &#8212; said there were some “difficult decisions” that he had to make, involved.&nbsp; Can you just elaborate on what he meant?&nbsp; Is there a concern that this sort of arrangement incentivizes other countries to wrongfully detain Americans?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, first, let me say that it&#8217;s a huge moment today that speaks to President Biden&#8217;s commitment to bring home Americans held hostage and wrongfully detained around the world.&nbsp; And he has been clear since the beginning of this administration that he is committed to doing exactly that: to bringing Americans home.<br>&nbsp;<br>He&#8217;s brought home Americans from Venezuela, from Afghanistan, from Haiti, from Burma, and now, today, from Russia.<br>&nbsp;<br>And Trevor&#8217;s freedom is the result of months and months of hard, careful work across the U.S. government.<br>&nbsp;<br>Now I&#8217;ll get to your question.&nbsp; When he referenced the tough decision in his statement this morning, he was referencing the decision to commute the sentence of Konstantin Yaroshenko.&nbsp; I would emphasize that this individual had already served the majority of his prison sentence for a nonviolent drug crime.&nbsp; And our overriding priority here was the safe return of Trevor Reed, knowing not only had he been held against his will for too long, but that his health condition required urgent treatment.&nbsp; He&#8217;s going to be able to not only be reunited &#8212; united &#8212; reunited with his family, but to receive the treatment he needed from the United States.<br>&nbsp;<br>So, again, our objective is to bring all Americans who are detained, who are held, who are away from their families home from overseas.&nbsp; But I&#8217;m not going to be able to preview for you what processes or approaches we&#8217;re going to take for those moving forward.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And is there a concern that now it&#8217;s not just detaining Americans but wrongfully mistreating them allows &#8212; a lot of them get seriously ill &#8212; it gives other countries leverage over the United States in terms of creating another opportunity, such as this, for this sort of prisoner swap?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, again, unfortunately, Zeke, you know, there are Americans who are held in other places around the world who we are still working to bring home.&nbsp; And that has been the case long before the President and, importantly, our hostage negotiator took the steps to bring Trevor Reed home.<br>&nbsp;<br>So I &#8212; this has been going on for a long time, I guess is my &#8212; is my larger point.&nbsp; And our effort and our objective was to take steps that we needed to take to bring him home, knowing his health conditions and knowing he&#8217;s been held for too long.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And a slightly different topic: Russia yesterday effectively cutting out that &#8212; cutting off natural gas to Poland and Bulgaria.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What&#8217;s the White House response to that?&nbsp; And are there additional steps the U.S. government is taking to reassure its European allies that &#8212; maybe not so much now, but certainly when the weather turns later this year &#8212; that they will have the energy supplies they need?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; Well, unfortunately, this is not &#8212; this is the type of step, the type of almost weaponizing energy supplies that we had predicted that Russia could take in this conflict.&nbsp; That is why we, of course, have been in touch with Europe, including over the &#8212; with these countries &#8212; including over the last 24 hours, with leaders in Poland and Bulgaria.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And we have been working for some time now, for months, with partners around the world to diversify natural gas supply to Europe to &#8212; in anticipation of and to also address near-term needs and replace volumes that would otherwise come from Russia.<br>&nbsp;<br>I would note that last month, in advance of this, the President launched a task force with the EU to target additional LNG volumes for Europe, including Poland and Bulgaria.&nbsp; This will help replace, over time, Russian gas to Europe, decreasing Europe&#8217;s dependence on Russia and Putin’s ability to use energy to coerce Europe.<br>&nbsp;<br>I would also note that Poland and Polish leaders have said they have the capacity through the reserves and other imports right now, for the moment.&nbsp; And Bulgaria has said it is also looking at other import actions.<br>&nbsp;<br>So we are working and we have been working to address over the long term.&nbsp; We have been in touch with these leaders over the last 24 hours.&nbsp; And I would also note what they&#8217;ve said about what their capacities are for the current short term.<br>&nbsp;<br>Go ahead.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; Has the President been in touch with or does he plan to reach out to Paul Whelan&#8217;s family, Brittney Griner’s family, any of the other families who have loved ones detained in Russia?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We have, of course, been in touch with their families over the course of time.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not going to detail those conversations further.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Paul Whelan&#8217;s brother, David Whelan, put out a statement today.&nbsp; He said, “If this case required difficult decisions that the President doesn&#8217;t take lightly, how difficult are the decisions he faces to release Paul?”&nbsp; What&#8217;s your response to the Whelan family?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Our response is that we are going to continue to do, the President is going to continue to do, our State Department officials and negotiators are going to continue to do everything they can to bring Paul Whelan home.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I could just ask one more follow-up: The President, of course, met with Reed’s family here at the White House.&nbsp; Can you talk about the personal impact that that meeting might have had?&nbsp; Did it &#8212; did he leave that meeting with a sense of urgency &#8212; a renewed sense of urgency to get this done?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I would say the President has had a sense of urgency about bringing Americans home long before that meeting.&nbsp; Of course, he enjoyed that meeting he had with them.&nbsp; He also spoke with them on the phone when he went and traveled to Texas.&nbsp; And again, I know he was intending to reach out to them this morning as well.<br>&nbsp;<br>Go ahead.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the economy, we have a GDP print that&#8217;s coming out tomorrow that&#8217;s expected to show fairly marginal growth.&nbsp; There&#8217;s increasing expectations from banks, predictions of &#8212; that we&#8217;re entering a recession.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Your budget plan had a focus on budget deficit reduction, as opposed to fiscal stimulus.&nbsp; Is there any plan to change that as we see the threat of a recession looming?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, again, as I&#8217;ve said before on the recession question: Obviously, we look closely at economic data.&nbsp; We continue to believe that there are &#8212; there are strong data in the economy, whether it&#8217;s record job growth, whether it is the current unemployment rate.&nbsp; And that is a result of the actions of the President.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>I would note on the GDP expectations for tomorrow: As you noted, the market expectations and other analysts out there do expect the growth to be slower in quarter one, which is what the data is being reported out tomorrow, than in quarter &#8212; the fourth quarter of last year.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>This largely reflects the str- &#8212; very strong pace of growth in the fourth quarter.&nbsp; When taken together, growth over the two quarters is expected to be at a solid pace if we look at it over time, which is how we look at data.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And looking under the hood, the slowdown relative to quarter four is mainly for technical reasons like the change in inventory.&nbsp; So, last quarter, companies built up their inventories very quickly.&nbsp; And growth in inventories are expected to be slower, though still positive, this quarter.<br>&nbsp;<br>This is something that has been pointed out &#8212; or this trend or these reasoning &#8212; this reasoning, I should say, has been pointed out by a range of outside economists and forecasters, including former NEC Director Jason Furman.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A quick follow-up just on inflation: There&#8217;s been some numbers that have shown that, you know, the monthly interest payment that somebody pays when they take out a mortgage has basically doubled over the past year.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>You&#8217;ve talked about what you&#8217;re doing on meat prices.&nbsp; But if you look at the grocery bill, pretty widely there are many categories where we&#8217;re seeing double-digit inflation: flour, coffee, fruit.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Is there any strategy to deal with some of these other areas where we&#8217;re seeing, kind of, broad-based inflation?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would say the President&#8217;s plan to address inflation or address causes or costs as they&#8217;ve gone up for the American people has many different components.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Obviously, there&#8217;s an important purview that the Federal Reserve has, and they&#8217;ve indicated their plans to recalibrate.&nbsp; We support that &#8212; that effort or steps they intend to take.&nbsp; And obviously, they have purview over and they&#8217;ve predicted that inflation will come down and moderate before the end of the year.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>But how the American people experience inflation is costs, as you noted, whether it&#8217;s at the grocery store or other costs on their pocketbook.&nbsp; And the President has taken a number of steps to address costs, even extending the pause on student loans, which is something he did just a few weeks ago; the steps to fix the “family glitch” in the Affordable Care Act so more people would be eligible for lower-cost healthcare; and continuing conversations that are happening on Capitol Hill right now on his proposals to lower costs on childcare, healthcare, the cost of prescription drugs.&nbsp; These are all areas that impact and will help families as we&#8217;re working to bring costs down.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Go ahead.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The President told Trevor Reed’s family that he wanted to call them in the middle of the night last night but didn&#8217;t want to jinx the release of their son.&nbsp; Can you tell us more about what&#8217;s been happening behind closed doors for the last, you know, 12 or 24 hours regarding this release?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; And, you know, I think what the President was referring to &#8212; you know, and I&#8217;ve fortunately &#8212; because it&#8217;s a part of history and a great day, obviously, when you bring an American home, and the President has, of course, been a part of many of these in a much higher and more important role &#8212; is just &#8212; there&#8217;s a lot of sensitivity, as you all know, around the period of time when individuals are in transit &#8212; right? &#8212; when they are being brought to a third country.<br>&nbsp;<br>As we&#8217;ve noted, you know, we are very grateful to Turkey for allowing the exchange to take place in their country.&nbsp; So, basically, over the last 24 hours &#8212; one, as I noted, this &#8212; this had been happening over several months.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So, Roger Carstens, the Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs, and his team and many others have been &#8212; had been negotiating and engaging in this.&nbsp;&nbsp;And the exchange took place in Turkey during the early hours of the morning, East Coast time.&nbsp;&nbsp;So I think what the President was referring to was his understanding and knowledge that that would be happening but not wanting to put anyone in a position of putting that at risk, even people who are excited and joyful and looking forward to the news.<br>&nbsp;<br>And, you know, then once they got to Turkey and they were safely on a plane on their way back, we were able to obviously make notifications and phone calls and also put out this statement from the President to make all of you aware.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Were any other conditions agreed to for Trevor Reed&#8217;s release, besides the release of this Russian?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; This was the discussion about one issue and one topic, and that was the release of Trevor Reed.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But were there any other conditions agreed to besides releasing the Russian in exchange for Trevor Reed?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; There is no other condition.&nbsp; There were no other conditions that I’m aware of.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And what does the White House read into Russia’s willingness to release Trevor Reed now, in the middle of this invasion of Ukraine?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Look, I think the release of Trevor Reed, him returning home to his family, receiving the healthcare that he has long needed, does not change our approach or view, opposition, or the President&#8217;s intention to put forward a package in the coming days to help continue to support the Ukrainians.<br>&nbsp;<br>In terms of what they mean or how they assess it, I would leave it to them to speak to that.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But does it make anyone here at the White House more optimistic about what could be ahead, or does it have nothing to do with anything &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; This is &#8212; was about one issue and topic, and I don&#8217;t think we should read into it further.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can we go toward the back?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah, we can come to the back in a moment.&nbsp; Go ahead, Weijia.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; To follow up on MaryAlice&#8217;s question, during an interview this morning, Trevor Reed’s parents said they believed that personal meeting with the President was the, quote, “tipping point,” that it made all the difference.&nbsp; Is that true?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, look, I would say anytime that you meet with &#8212; a President meets with or any official from the government meets with the parents or family members of someone who&#8217;s being detained, that impacts them personally.<br>&nbsp;<br>But this had been negotiated &#8212; in negotiations for months.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I spoke with David Whelan today, and he is concerned that Reed’s release now narrows the chances for his brother&#8217;s release, because Russia obviously was &#8212; you know, wanted Yaroshenko’s release for years now, and now that it&#8217;s happened, he worries that that was a major concession that the U.S. no longer has.&nbsp; So what do you say to the Whelan family?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, we would say we will continue to advocate for the immediate, unconditional of Paul Whelan at every opportunity.&nbsp; And using wrongful detention as a bargaining chip represents a threat to the safety of everyone traveling, working, and living abroad.&nbsp; We obviously oppose this practice anywhere, and we are going to continue to do everything we can to bring him home.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They are thrilled, obviously, about Trevor Reed&#8217;s release, but they can&#8217;t help but have some questions about why Paul Whelan, who’s been detained in Russia longer than Trevor Reed, is not home.&nbsp; Can you explain that?&nbsp; And did Reed&#8217;s health, as you mentioned, have anything to do with it?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Obviously, our objective continues to be to bring Paul Whelan home and any American who is not with their family and is being detained overseas.&nbsp; But I&#8217;m just not going to get into more details because I want to maintain the protection of our process.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, on a separate topic: Yesterday, Dr. Jha said that people who are at high risk for developing a severe case of COVID are eligible for Paxlovid.&nbsp; And the Vice President just got her second booster shot.&nbsp; She has no symptoms.&nbsp; Can you help us understand why she&#8217;s taking it?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, he also said, which you didn&#8217;t include in your summary there, but &#8212; that you should consult with your doctor, and she consulted with her doctor.&nbsp; She has been given Paxlovid.&nbsp; That’s something many Americans may be eligible for; they should also consult with their doctor.<br>&nbsp;<br>And I think, overall, we&#8217;re just grateful that this is an approved drug on the market that many people can benefit from, including the Vice President.<br>&nbsp;<br>Okay, thank you.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go ahead in the back.&nbsp; In the way back.&nbsp; Way back.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eleven years ago, Japan had a terrible disaster and the U.S. launched a program most people have probably forgotten called Operation Tomodachi.&nbsp; Twenty-five thousand American military and ten thousand volunteers came from Japan to help.&nbsp; And one of those that came was President Biden.&nbsp; I’m wondering if on this upcoming trip he&#8217;ll be coming back to that area for a short visit.<br>&nbsp;<br>And while we&#8217;re waiting for advisement, is it possible to do an interview with you?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Oh &#8212; okay.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; You often come with an interview request.&nbsp; I should know ahead of time.<br>&nbsp;<br>I will just note I expect we will have more details on the President&#8217;s travel to Asia &#8212; something he is clearly looking forward to since he&#8217;s spoken about it publicly &#8212; soon, in the coming days.&nbsp; But in advance of that, I&#8217;m just not going to have much more to preview for all of you.<br>&nbsp;<br>Okay, go ahead.&nbsp; Go ahead &#8212; go ahead.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; Yesterday, after the Vice President announced that she tested positive, the usual people on the Internet and elsewhere who don&#8217;t like vaccines, who don&#8217;t think COVID (inaudible), immediately started with the, “Well, she would have been fine even if she hadn&#8217;t gotten the vaccine.”<br>&nbsp;<br>It seems like every time there&#8217;s a high-profile announcement that someone has gotten COVID &#8212; be it a member of Congress, AG Garland, people at the Gridiron dinner &#8212; people take it as proof that vaccines don&#8217;t work.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So, what about the White House&#8217;s messaging could be better on that, given that 234,000 Americans died?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; Well, first, I would say the truth, is &#8212; which is, I think, why you&#8217;re asking me this question &#8212; is quite the contrary.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>I mean, the Vice President is continuing to carry out her duties, as the Vice President of the United States, from home, engaging in meetings, policy discussions &#8212; I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll see her in some capacity publicly from home as well &#8212; because she is double boosted and she has taken the steps to protect herself, like we have continued to recommend other Americans do.<br>&nbsp;<br>So, I would note that while the vaccine &#8212; the reason to take the vaccine is, of course, because it can protect you from severe death &#8212; from death, from severe illness &#8212; “severe death,” that was a little intense how I said that &#8212; (laughter) &#8212; from death or severe illness, and it &#8212; by multitudes of numbers.<br>&nbsp;<br>And, you know, we&#8217;re going to continue &#8212; and if you are eligible for a booster as she was, as the President was, we recommend you get that for a second booster, because it can put you in a position where even if you get COVID, you&#8217;re able to still not &#8212; experience minimal symptoms or no symptoms, like the Vice President has been, and to continue to go about daily life the best you can while you&#8217;re quarantining.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Go ahead, Tam.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yep, thank you.&nbsp; Dr. Fauci said on the PBS NewsHour last night, quote, “This country is out of the pandemic phase of COVID.”&nbsp; What phase are we in right now?&nbsp; And also, if we are out of the pandemic phase, why are emergency measures still in place?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, what Dr. Fauci was saying is that we are in a different phase of this pandemic, and that&#8217;s absolutely true.&nbsp; Last month, the President announced a plan for how we can move forward safely while staying on our front foot against COVID.&nbsp; As he pointed out, nationwide, cases are relatively low &#8212; far below the 900,000 cases a day we saw during the Omicron surge.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Even as we&#8217;ve seen upticks, hospitalizations are about &#8212; at about the lowest level since the pandemic, and deaths are declining.&nbsp; So, there&#8217;s no question that we are in a moment &#8212; a different moment in our fight against COVID.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>But we also know COVID isn&#8217;t over and the pandemic isn&#8217;t over.&nbsp; And what Dr. Jha said yesterday also is that &#8212; different doctor, I realize, but I just want to reference him since he was just here &#8212; is that cases are low, driven by the extremely &#8212; while cases are low, cases &#8212; while cases &#8212; while low, cases are still &#8212; you know, we&#8217;ve seen an uptick in some places driven by the extremely transmissible BA.2 variant.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>We know the risk of potential sur- &#8212; surges, even as a potential new variant or subvariant remains.&nbsp; So, different phase, because we&#8217;re at a much lower level of hospitalizations, of deaths, and even, nationwide, of cases.&nbsp; But we are still seeing people get very sick from COVID and cases of COVID, and we have measures that we should all continue to take to protect ourselves.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just a couple of very quick, short other questions.&nbsp; Daleep Singh is reportedly taking a leave of absence.&nbsp; Can you confirm that &#8212; when he&#8217;ll be gone and what that means for the sanctions work that he&#8217;s doing that is very important right now?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; It is very important.&nbsp; He&#8217;s a very important member of the national security team.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have any details or any confirmation of his plans.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>What I would note, and if Daleep were here &#8212; and we’ll invite him &#8212; he would note is that he has an incredible team he works with who helps put together these sanctions package, help &#8212; packages &#8212; helps implementation, helps coordinate diplomatically.&nbsp; And we will &#8212; there are a number of people who will continue to do that work.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And when are you sending the funding request for Ukraine funding up to the Hill?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, the President said last week it will be this week.&nbsp; So, there&#8217;s only two days left of this week.&nbsp; As soon as tomorrow, but in the next two days.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Go ahead.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indonesia decided to invite President Zelenskyy to the G20.&nbsp; I&#8217;m wondering if you have a reaction to that, but also what it says about progress that the U.S. might be making behind the scenes, hoping to expel Russia from that forum, and if the decision to invite President Zelenskyy has informed and the President can confirm that he&#8217;s going to now attend the summit.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, we&#8217;ve seen the reports that President Zelenskyy has been invited to the G20.&nbsp; And we certainly welcome that.&nbsp; As you know, President Biden said just last month that Ukraine should be able to participate.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>But we don&#8217;t have further confirmation beyond the news reports, which we certainly think are positive.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>And as he also said last month &#8212; which is, of course, why you&#8217;re asking me &#8212; he doesn&#8217;t think Russia should be invited, but, ultimately, it&#8217;s a decision for the G20.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So, we don&#8217;t have any new announcements at this point.&nbsp; We will continue to engage.&nbsp; And we&#8217;ve reached out, of course, to Indonesia, as you noted, who&#8217;s hosting the summit.&nbsp; But we don&#8217;t have any other additional details.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>It&#8217;s six months away.&nbsp; Typically, the President does attend, but I don&#8217;t have anything to confirm about a trip six months away at this point.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just a quick one on Ukraine.&nbsp; There&#8217;s been questions about why the U.S. hasn&#8217;t suspended steel tariffs on Ukrainian steel coming in.&nbsp; Do you have any information about why we&#8217;ve maintained those tariffs, considering everything with (inaudible)?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure.&nbsp;&nbsp;I &#8212; obviously, there are a range of considerations to provide not only direct assistance but economic relief to the Ukrainians under consideration.&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&#8217;t have anything to preview at this point in time.&nbsp;<br><br>I&#8217;ll go to Kristen and then Jacqui, and then I&#8217;ll go to the back.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jen, thank you so much. &nbsp;Following up on Tam, we actually just reported that the White House is tomorrow &#8212; as soon as tomorrow &#8212; going to request the supplemental, and that will &#8212; it will be through the end of the fiscal year, and that it&#8217;s going to be “massive.”&nbsp;<br><br>Can you help characterize how much money will the administration be asking for?&nbsp;&nbsp;Will we hear from the President on this?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp;&nbsp;So, let me try to answer all those questions, and then tell me if I don&#8217;t.&nbsp; I can confirm “as soon as tomorrow” &#8212; only two days left in this week, but it will definitely be this week that we will send up the supplemental.<br><br>In terms of the President&#8217;s schedule, his role, I have nothing to preview at this point in time.&nbsp; As soon as anything is finalized, if he&#8217;s going to speak publicly, we will announce that to all of you or let you all know.<br><br>In terms of the length or the size, I don&#8217;t have a number for you at this point in time.&nbsp; But there is plans for this to be a proposal to go through the fiscal year.&nbsp; And it will include, as our past packages have included, security or military assistance, humanitarian, economic assistance, given those, in our view, will help address a range of the needs the Ukrainians have.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; You did answer all of my question.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Obviously, there is a renewed push on Capitol Hill and behind the scenes here at the White House for some revised version of the Build Back Better plan &#8212; a scaled-back version.<br><br>When was the last time President Biden spoke with Senator Manchin in earnest about what he could sign off on?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; So, we&#8217;re just not going to detail that, per the President&#8217;s request, from here &#8212; any conversations he has with Senator Manchin or other senators &#8212; just to protect those conversations.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fair enough.&nbsp; Can you characterize, though &#8212; are the negotiations happening in earnest?&nbsp; Are there real talks going on about specific things that Senator Manchin, that the White House could agree to?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I would &#8212; I would tell you &#8212; and I&#8217;m sure your colleagues on the Hill, now that all these senators are back, can confirm this with a number of them right now, or today &#8212; that there are still a great deal of interest, passion in moving forward with the President&#8217;s plan to lower costs for Americans and a lot of senators who would like to see this move forward.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secretary Mayorkas is getting a real grilling on Capitol Hill today, particularly about Title 42 and the plans that are in place to deal with it.&nbsp; DHS has acknowledged that a surge would put a substantial strain on resources.&nbsp;<br><br>Now, obviously, DHS announced this six-point, 20-page plan.&nbsp; But given that strain that DHS is anticipating, why should the American people have confidence that you&#8217;ll be able to deal with that surge of migrants if Title 42 is lifted?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, first, I would say, just as a reminder: It is a health authority, not an immigration plan or an immigration authority, and it&#8217;s not meant to be a replacement of.&nbsp; So the determination about where we stand and to lift it was made by the CDC.<br><br>Just to note the six-point plan that Secretary Mayorkas put out and talked about today, or over the last 24 hours, includes six pillars: surging resources, including personnel, transportation, medical support; enhancing CBP processing efficiency and moving with deliberate speed to mitigate potential overcrowding; administering consequences for unlawful entry; bolstering the capacity of nongovernmental organizations to receive noncitizens; targeting and disrupting the transnational criminal organization and smugglers; and deterring irregular migration.&nbsp;<br><br>So, what he talked about today is exactly what his preparedness plan &#8212; that&#8217;s been in the works and in the planning for months &#8212; would do.&nbsp; And they have talked about the need, potentially, for more resources to make that happen.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And just to be very clear, and some Democrats have said this: Does the plan &#8212; will the plan be in place before Title 42 is lifted?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; That is exactly what the preparedness and implementation plan is intended to do.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Go ahead, Jacqui.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; Dr. Fauci said that he&#8217;s not going to the White House Correspondents’ Dinner, citing COVID concerns.&nbsp; Obviously, he&#8217;s the President&#8217;s chief medical advisor.&nbsp; As far as we know, the President is still planning to attend.&nbsp; How should people understand Dr. Fauci’s decision versus the President&#8217;s decision?&nbsp; And is there any concern that the President would be seen as not following the science in some way?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;Well, first, I would note and respect everyone&#8217;s privacy, including Dr. Fauci’s, as much as he&#8217;s very much a public figure.&nbsp; But as you all know, he can speak for himself and his decisions.&nbsp; And every individual will make their own decisions about whether they attend this event, other events, whether they wear a mask at it or not.<br><br>Obviously, the White House Correspondents’ Association is requiring same-day testing.&nbsp; That&#8217;s a &#8212; that&#8217;s a decision they have made.&nbsp; The President outlined, as you all know, a 100-page plan in March intended to position us to go back to our more normal routines.&nbsp; But in that, that requires making risk assessments and decisions about what you&#8217;re going to do and what you&#8217;re going to attend and be a part of, as we all do every day.&nbsp;<br><br>Today, the President felt it was very important to be at and speak at the memorial service for a diplomatic icon &#8212; Secretary Madeleine Albright.&nbsp; He made the decision to do that, despite the fact that there were hundreds if not thousands of people there.&nbsp;<br><br>He has made the decision he wants to attend, in a safe way, the White House Correspondents’ Dinner to show his support &#8212; showcase his support for the free press, for the work of all of you, for the work of your colleagues around the world to not only share accurate information about COVID but also report on the war in Ukraine and all of the work that happens every single day.&nbsp;<br><br>That does stand in stark contrast to his predecessor, who not only questioned the legitimacy of the press on a nearly dai&#8211; &#8212; daily basis, but also never attended the dinner, I don&#8217;t believe.<br><br>So, he felt that was important and made a risk assessment to do that in consultation with his doctors and healthcare team.&nbsp;<br><br>I would note that we also take additional precautions and steps.&nbsp; I would expect that he may wear a mask when he&#8217;s not speaking.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll wear a mask when I&#8217;m at the dinner, in all likelihood.&nbsp; And we also took steps, including the fact that he&#8217;s not attending for the eating portion of the dinner and he&#8217;ll be there for the program, which includes a number of speakers, the presentation of scholarships, as you know, and, of course, his speaking and his roasting, where he will be “on the menu,” as he likes to say, when Trevor Noah is speaking.<br><br>So, you know, just like anything, it&#8217;s a risk assessment and a decision he made on a personal basis.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; And I want to ask a few questions on Title 42, but real quick, I want to take another stab at a question I tried yesterday.&nbsp; You answered the first part of it.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve heard the President say over and over again that he has never spoken to his son about his business dealings.&nbsp; Has he ever spoken to his son&#8217;s business partners about his son&#8217;s business dealings?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Again, nothing has changed about what I said yesterday.&nbsp; The President does not get involved in the business dealings of his son.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even through his son&#8217;s business partners?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Nothing has changed since what I said yesterday.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t believe you answered that part of my question yesterday though.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; He&#8217;s not involved in his son&#8217;s business dealings.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; On Title 42, Mayorkas detailed this six-point plan; part of it involves sending healthcare providers from the VA.&nbsp; He was asked about this on the Hill today.&nbsp; He said that it&#8217;s necessary, that this interagency effort is necessary.&nbsp; But is it appropriate to be taking resources away from the VA to help with the surge at the border?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Again, these dec- &#8212; these decisions and discussions about what resources are possible are made through the interagency process, and clearly, having support and resources for our nation&#8217;s veterans is a top priority to the President.&nbsp; But we also want to take steps we can at the border, even as we anticipate an increase in migrants coming to the border, to keep the American people safe.&nbsp; And this is part of that effort.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another piece of this plan talked about the law enforcement help.&nbsp; CBP has 23,000 agents working on the southern border right now.&nbsp; We&#8217;re already seeing 7,000 illegal crossings a day; that is expected to surge to 18,000 when Title 42 is lifted.&nbsp; So, how does adding 600 law enforcement officers make a dent in that?&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would say, Jacqui, that one of the reasons that Secretary Mayorkas is participating in the important, you know, democratic process of testifying on the Hill is to answer the questions of exactly how the resources he&#8217;s requesting, and they have identified as needing, to address this potential increase will help address that.&nbsp; So I would point you to his many hours of testimony today and tomorrow.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then there&#8217;s been reporting that Speaker Pelosi is unhappy with the way that the White House has handled Title 42 and worried that if it comes up for a vote as part of the Ukraine package, that Democrats wouldn&#8217;t have the votes to defeat that.&nbsp; Does the White House share that concern?&nbsp; And what do you make of Pelosi seeming to be kind of shaky on just how close she is with the White House on this decision?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would say we&#8217;re incredibly close with Speaker Pelosi, and the President has known her for many, many decades.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t &#8212; I don&#8217;t have more to spell out or explain what her meaning was or what “defeat it” means or doesn&#8217;t mean.&nbsp;<br><br>There are many strong feelings and points of view on Capitol Hill in the House and in the Senate about Title 42.&nbsp; It wasn&#8217;t a decision made by the White House.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a decision made to lift it by the CDC.&nbsp; The authority given to &#8212; was given to them by Congress.&nbsp;<br><br>And our effort and our focus is on implementation.&nbsp; And the Department &#8212; the Secretary of Homeland Security is obviously testifying on that.&nbsp;<br><br>So, I don&#8217;t have any more to explain about the particular comments.&nbsp; But we obviously work very closely with Speaker Pelosi on a range of issues, including immigration.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But a number of Democrats are, you know, speaking up about their problems with Title 42.&nbsp; I mean, Mark Kelly was briefed by Mayorkas yesterday.&nbsp; He said that he still has remaining questions about how and when resources are going to hit the ground.&nbsp; These are Democrats saying these things.&nbsp; They&#8217;re not wanting, you know, Title 42 to replace an immigration effort, but they&#8217;re saying that there just is not a plan in place to support what&#8217;s going to happen when Title 42 goes away.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, what I was trying to note earlier, perhaps not articulately, is that there are a range of members who have strong concerns about it being lifted.&nbsp; Again, not a decision we make &#8212; a decision made by health and science experts.&nbsp; And there are many members who feel very strongly about it actually being &#8212; it lifted and that moving forward.<br>&nbsp;<br>This is why Secretary Mayorkas is on the Hill doing, I believe, four hearings, answering extensive questions from a range of members, Democratic and Republican.&nbsp; He put out a six-pillar plan on exactly how he&#8217;s going to implement it.&nbsp; And that has been a plan that&#8217;s been in the works for six months.&nbsp; So, this is part of the democratic process happening, and he&#8217;s happy to be on the Hill answering their questions.<br>&nbsp;<br>Go ahead, Peter.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey, Jen.&nbsp; The bipartisan leadership of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senators Durbin and Grassley, have expressed concern about the DHS inspector general delaying or diminishing reports on sexual misconduct.&nbsp; This is Trump-era holdover.&nbsp; Is the President going to fire or in some way intervene with Mr. Cuffari, who is the inspector general, and is there any broader sense about what to do about Trump-era inspectors general?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I know that there can be changes made.&nbsp; I have not dug into this particular inspector general with the President or the team here.&nbsp; I&#8217;m happy to do that.&nbsp; And I can follow up with you after the briefing.<br>&nbsp;<br>Go ahead.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; On the issue of student debt, I know you&#8217;ve been asked about this before, but Senator Schumer just told reporters on the Hill that the President is getting closer to canceling up to $50,000 in student loan debt for borrowers.&nbsp; He said, &#8220;The President is moving in our direction… We&#8217;re getting closer.”&nbsp; Is that true?&nbsp; When can we expect a decision?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Look, the President has been considering and looking at options for how to provide more le- &#8212; relief to students across the country.<br>&nbsp;<br>I would note, again, that not a single borrower of federal student loans has paid a penny on these loans since he took office.&nbsp; And this has been the longest time of that for any President, probably, in history.&nbsp; You can factcheck me on that. And he&#8217;s continuing to consider a range of options in terms of any additional steps.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A follow-up on that &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Let me go to the back.&nbsp; Go ahead.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.&nbsp; Two questions.&nbsp; A follow-up on the student loan forgiveness.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You said that the President is looking at a range of options with regards to canceling some student debt.&nbsp; But is the President looking at any options for those students and parents who saved and sacrificed so that they wouldn&#8217;t have to take out such massive loans?&nbsp; Is he looking at including them in relief retroactively?&nbsp; How would they be made whole if there was<br>some sort of canceling of debt?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; You mean for people who have paid off all of their student loans?<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah &#8212; who made sacrifices so that they wouldn&#8217;t have to take out some of those loans.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; It&#8217;s a good question.&nbsp; What I can tell you at this point is that there&#8217;s legislation he&#8217;d be happy to sign for individuals who have $10,000 in existing student debt.&nbsp; If Congress wanted to send that to him, he&#8217;d be happy to sign it, and he&#8217;s looking at executive actions and authorities.&nbsp; But I don&#8217;t have anything to preview on that front.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Then, you know, if the President does move on canceling some of the student debt, isn&#8217;t that just one half of the equation though?&nbsp; I mean, what is he looking at in order to keep some of these public universities from jacking up tuition prices, despite some of the federal subsidies that they&#8217;ve been getting?&nbsp; I mean, what is it to stop some of these schools from just increasing tuition for the next generation of students?&nbsp; Isn&#8217;t that half of the equation?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know if people would consider it half of the equation.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know.&nbsp; We&#8217;ll let Americans define it.&nbsp; I would point you the Department of Education to talk about their efforts on that front.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And one last quick follow-up.&nbsp; Is the President&#8217;s weekly lunch with the Vice President still a priority for him?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Absolutely.&nbsp; Obviously, they&#8217;re not going to be dining in person while she is quarantining at home, but they did speak yesterday and I expect they will speak regularly while she is quarantining.&nbsp; And she is participating in a number of policy meetings here, too.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a follow-up.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Go ahead.&nbsp; Oh, well &#8212; and then I can come to you next.<br>&nbsp;<br>Oh, go ahead.&nbsp; So polite.&nbsp; Go ahead.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you have any reaction to Boeing claiming that it&#8217;s lost $1.1 billion on the Air Force One contract?&nbsp; And, more important, has the President ordered Boeing to stick with the traditional blue-and-white design instead of the garish red?&nbsp; (Laughter.)<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; This is bringing me back to, like, my first week in this job.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know, we gave you a year.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yes, I appreciate it.&nbsp; I actually don&#8217;t have any information on the plans for the new Air Force One.&nbsp; I can certainly check and see what we know, and I can get back to you on that.<br>&nbsp;<br>Go ahead.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; Do you know why the Vice President&#8217;s doctor recommended she take Paxlovid?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Oh, well, I think as Dr. Jha said yesterday, there are a range of Americans who may not know they&#8217;re eligible and they should consult with their doctor.&nbsp; That&#8217;s exactly what she did.&nbsp; And one of the chal &#8212; not challenges, but one of our efforts right now is to provide more information publicly and have more people consult with their doctors about whether they&#8217;re eligible.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you know if she&#8217;s, like, showing symptoms?&nbsp; Or would her getting, like, severe COVID present, like, a national security risk?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; They obviously said yesterday that she did not have any symptoms.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have any update beyond that.<br>&nbsp;<br>She&#8217;s continuing to work from home, conducting her duties as Vice President, so I don&#8217;t believe we&#8217;re talking about a national security issue in this moment.&nbsp; She can also do secure calls and video conferences from her home because we have that capacity.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But if she got severe COVID disease, would that not be a national security risk?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I&#8217;m not going to &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, Paxlovid would potentially prevent that.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I&#8217;m not going to speak to a hypothetical of the Vice President getting sicker at this point in time, which I think is probably understandable.<br>&nbsp;<br>Go ahead.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can the White House give us any update on Trevor Reed&#8217;s condition after his release or any treatments that he might have received following his release?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, you know, obviously we&#8217;re going to respect his privacy, and we spoke to his health conditions because we wanted to emphasize how important it was and the urgency of bringing him home.&nbsp; But we will, of course, leave that to him and his family to speak to and respect his health privacy beyond now.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then on the Vice President, did her role as Vice President have any impact on her receiving this treatment?&nbsp; Did that &#8212; you know, her serving as somebody who is in the line of succession, did that have any impact on her getting Paxlovid?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I think it&#8217;s important to note Paxlovid is widely available across the country through people consulting with their doctors.&nbsp; So it is not just a treatment that is available to only a small population of the public.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>In fact, what our effort is and what our focus is, at this point, is more broadly educating people on how they may be eligible for it.&nbsp; Certainly, we are grateful that this treatment is out there and available so that the Vice President, somebody who&#8217;s incredibly important in the line of succession, can take it.&nbsp; But she did it through consultations with her doctor.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Go ahead, in the middle.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; So, Democrats on the Hill today said they will act soon on efforts to lower the prices of gas and that a federal gas tax holiday is still on the table for them.&nbsp; If they give the &#8212; or if they include a federal gas tax holiday in a bill, would the President support that?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; The President has long said that he&#8217;s open to a range of options, including a federal gas tax holiday, and we&#8217;re continuing to consult with members of Congress about a range of options on lowering the price of gas.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Go ahead.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; So, on Poland and Bulgaria: Energy experts see that as sort of a warning from Russia to Germany, other countries in Europe, to pay in rubles.&nbsp; Is there a me- &#8212; and we&#8217;re also hearing that some companies in Europe are paying rubles for energy.&nbsp; Is there a message from the White House to those companies or countries that might cave and pay in rubles for energy?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t think we have a new message to offer today.&nbsp; What I would note is that we have long predicted &#8212; I mean, this is the Russian playbook; part of the Russian playbook is weaponizing energy.&nbsp; So could they do it other places?&nbsp; That certainly is possible.&nbsp; That&#8217;s one of the reasons why this taskforce was launched, at the President &#8212; that we&#8217;re working with the Europeans on, to ensure that we are diversifying access for LNG and also for oil as well for the Europeans.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, about a month ago, you announced that the U.S. was going to release 1 million barrels a day for six months.&nbsp; Oil prices &#8212; crude oil prices are still over a hundred dollars a barrel today.&nbsp; Gas prices are up.&nbsp; Is it having the intended effect?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, we&#8217;ve &#8212; we&#8217;ve said this is one tool that we can &#8212; we can utilize.&nbsp; And I know that gas prices also did come down from the beginning as a result of these actions, but we&#8217;re continuing to explore additional options.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>As we know, the oil markets are a global market, and increasing supply and continuing to work with other countries to increase supply is part of our overall objective here.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It went down only 3 cents, and we&#8217;re about 20 cents away from the record.&nbsp; So &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, again, we&#8217;re going to continue to take steps to reduce the price of gas for the American people.&nbsp; Every option &#8212; a range of options remains on the table, as is evidenced by the earlier question.&nbsp; And we know that increasing supply and ensuring supply meets the demand on the marketplace as part of that effort.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>We also watch closely for any attempt at price gouging.&nbsp; When oil prices come down, obviously gas prices should come down.&nbsp; And as you know, because we&#8217;ve had a range of charts in here, we watch that closely as well.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s something we will continue to call out.<br>&nbsp;<br>I can do like one &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; I think we have to gather in a second.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Oh, I think &#8212; okay.&nbsp; Okay, one last one.&nbsp; Last one.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Go ahead.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, can I just ask quickly: When the supplemental request comes out, either I guess tomorrow or Friday, will there be anything changing any of the COVID-related requests that are previous?&nbsp; Is the only &#8212; are the only new materials going to be related to the Ukraine request, or will there be a new &#8212; a new spate of requests on COVID assistance as well?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; So, we will request assis- &#8212; COVID funding, and we will reiterate our requests for $22.5 billion for COVID funding, something we feel will help meet the immediate emergency needs we have.&nbsp; And that was a discussion, obviously, that we didn&#8217;t get through but we will continue with Congress in the coming days and weeks.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Thanks so much, everyone.<br>&nbsp;<br>3:47 P.M. EDT</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">East Room</p>



<p>THE FIRST LADY: Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you, Secretary Cardona. And welcome to the White House. (Applause.)<br>As I was reading through your stories, I was so impressed by the innovation and creativity that all of you bring to your classrooms every day.</p>



<p>Kurt Russell, our National Teacher of the Year, helps students find a sense of self worth by dressing for success.</p>



<p>Autumn Rivera, from Colorado &#8212; (applause) &#8212; helped her students join a campaign to save a local lake.</p>



<p>Jerad Koepp &#8212; where are you? &#8212; (applause) &#8212; has helped his Native American students explore their Tribal culture and history.</p>



<p>And the stories go on and on. But I also know that what makes your work special isn’t just the projects or presentations. It’s not the curriculum or the classroom tactics. It’s that smile that you &#8212; that tells students that they don’t have to be afraid to say and answer out loud.</p>



<p>It’s the calm in your voice that can still the &#8212; you know, the wild horses running through their hearts.<br>It’s the way that you know that sometimes “I’m fine” means everything is wrong.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s how they know that you&#8217;re telling the truth when you say, “It&#8217;s okay. We&#8217;re going to figure this out together.”</p>



<p>What makes your work so special is you: the love and the joy that you bring to it, the empathy and the understanding, the sheer power of your presence.</p>



<p>You do this work because it&#8217;s a part of who you are, because you have a calling. And you&#8217;re not alone.</p>



<p>Somewhere listening is a college student who grew up teaching her younger brothers and sisters and knows that she has a gift. A young man who took an education class and something just clicked for the first time. There&#8217;s an artist who wants to spread the joy of creating something out of nothing.</p>



<p>They have a calling, too, to show students an entirely new world in science or history or art, to guide them through uncharted paths to change someone&#8217;s life forever &#8212; in big, red-letter moments and small acts of kindness.</p>



<p>To them, I want to say: Listen to that call. Join us. Yes, you &#8212; you can change the world one student at a time. And we need you. We need more teachers. (Applause.)</p>



<p>I can&#8217;t promise that it will be an easy job. Right? (Laughter.) But I can promise that it will fill your life with meaning and purpose and joy.</p>



<p>My own grandmother was a teacher in a small town in New Jersey. And she loved her work, and her students loved her in return. And just like you might see in the movies, she used to call her students to class with a big brass bell.</p>



<p>And when she died, she didn&#8217;t leave behind a giant estate, but what I inherited from her &#8212; and what I still have to this day &#8212; is that bell. And I sometimes think about the way her legacy resonated into the world like waves of sound, changing those who heard its ring.</p>



<p>I think of every student she taught and every child who she inspired, and I wonder, like, what amazing things they grew up to do. Perhaps they are public servants working to make our communities a little stronger, a little fairer.</p>



<p>Perhaps they&#8217;re doctors saving lives or architects building our cities or scientists working to solve global challenges.<br>And, of course, there&#8217;s at least one teacher.</p>



<p>Today, all of you ring your own bell, pulling each person you teach into a harmony that never ends.</p>



<p>Right now, someone out there is a better thinker because of you. Someone is standing a little taller because you helped her find the confidence that she needed.</p>



<p>Someone is working a little harder because you pushed him to try. Someone is a little kinder because you showed her what that meant. And someone is braver because you helped him find his courage.</p>



<p>Never stop ringing that bell. Never forget that, student by student, the lives &#8212; (laughs) &#8212; now I’m getting emotional &#8212; (laughter) &#8212; the lives you change go on to change the world.</p>



<p>Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause.)</p>



<p>And now I&#8217;m proud to introduce someone who has answered their call with passion, persistence, and pride: the 2022 National Teacher of the Year, Kurt Russell.</p>

<p>The Biden Administration is sounding the alarm for the urgent need for Congress to provide funding for the nation’s COVID-19 response and is underscoring the severe consequences of their inaction: Fewer vaccines, treatments, and tests for the American people, and fewer shots in arms around the world.<br><br>Over the past 15 months, the Biden Administration has used the resources Congress provided to mobilize a comprehensive COVID-19 response. As a result, the United States has made tremendous progress in our fight against the virus—saving over 2 million American lives, safely reopening our schools, creating jobs at a record pace, returning to more normal routines, and averting $900 billion in health care costs.<br><br>In March, the President laid out a comprehensive National COVID-19 Preparedness Plan to keep America moving forward safely, by ensuring that lifesaving tools like vaccines and treatments remain free and widely available to Americans, by preparing for potential surges and new variants, and by getting more shots in arms around the world. Executing this plan remains essential to sustaining the progress we have made and saving more lives. There has been an uptick in cases in parts of the country and, while cases will continue to fluctuate, this virus has proven itself to be unpredictable. Without funding, the United States will be unprepared for whatever comes next.<br><br>COVID-19 isn’t waiting on Congress to negotiate. Other countries will not wait. Time is of the essence. Congress must act urgently to help save more American lives and ensure we remain prepared.<br><br>Congressional inaction on additional COVID-19 response funding means:<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Fewer Vaccines for Americans:</span></strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>The Administration cannot secure enough booster shots for every American, if they are needed in the fall.</strong> At this moment, the United States has enough supply to support one booster shot for Americans age 12 and over, and additional boosters for immunocompromised individuals and those age 50 and older. However, if additional booster shots are authorized and recommended for the general population, we will not have the supply necessary to provide free and easy access to them for all Americans. At this time last year, the Administration was contracting for future boosters that could ultimately be needed starting in September; this allowed us to make those booster shots free and widely available as soon as they were authorized. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) needs to begin contracting for boosters imminently so that the agency can conclude contractual negotiations as soon as May to ensure delivery of sufficient supply by September. Other countries are already placing orders for future needs and as a result, will get supply before it is available for Americans. Just yesterday, Pfizer submitted an application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for Emergency Use Authorization for its booster for kids ages 5 to 11. If these boosters are authorized and recommended, we would not have enough supply for every child in that age group. Not having enough supply to support booster shots for everyone, if needed, puts American lives at risk, and is a completely avoidable outcome.</li><li><strong>The Administration cannot secure new COVID-19 vaccines to protect against multiple variants for the American people.</strong> Vaccine manufacturers are working on developing vaccines that could offer broader and longer-lasting protection than our existing vaccines—and there is ongoing discussion among scientific and medical experts, including FDA’s panel of outside experts, about the potential need for vaccines with new formulations in the future to better protect us from variants. Just this month, Moderna released data on a new vaccine that could potentially offer better protection against multiple variants. The company also announced that it expects to release data on an Omicron-specific vaccine soon. This means that there could be more effective vaccines available as soon as this fall that can enhance the protection Americans receive from getting vaccinated. The United States should be securing these vaccines today, but without funding, the Administration cannot purchase doses for the American people or even ensure that America is in line for them. This could mean people in other countries have access to the best lifesaving vaccines before Americans. Vaccines have proven to be our single-most important tool in protecting people, and the best ones should be available for the American people.</li></ul>



<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Fewer Treatments for Americans:</span></strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>The Administration cannot restock the nation’s supply of lifesaving treatments. </strong>To date, the Administration has distributed over 9.6 million courses of treatment across the country, working with states and territories, Tribes, pharmacies, federal health centers, and other partners to provide them to Americans for free. Due to a lack of funding, we have already missed the opportunity to purchase additional supply of these lifesaving treatments. To stretch our supply as much as possible, last month, the Administration was forced to cut the number of monoclonal antibody treatments distributed to states by over 30 percent. Ensuring these treatments remain free, widely available, and easy to access for people who need them is crucial to our nation moving forward safely.</li><li><strong>The Administration cannot invest in promising treatments or secure newer, even better treatments for the American people. </strong>The federal government will not be able to invest in next-generation treatments that have the potential to provide broader protection against future variants or to treat people who may not be able to take full advantage of current treatments. Several candidates may be promising, and the United States will lose an opportunity to secure its spot in line and to support ramped-up manufacturing capacity of these treatments if we do not have funding to secure supply prior to a potential authorization or approval. Given COVID-19’s potential to mutate, it is also prudent to support and secure a range of effective treatments that attack the virus in different ways to guard against future variants.</li><li><strong>The Administration will have to scale back purchases of treatments that protect immunocompromised Americans. </strong>The Administration has secured more than 1 million courses of Evusheld, a preventive therapy for immunocompromised people. Due to lack of funding, we have had to substantially scale back our plans to purchase additional supply. This therapy takes months to produce, and at this point, we are at risk of missing out on supply that will be delivered in the last few months of 2022. Congressional inaction will put immunocompromised individuals at greater risk as we enter this fall.</li></ul>



<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Fewer Tests for Americans:</span></strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>The Administration cannot sustain domestic testing manufacturing capacity and will be unprepared for another surge in testing demand.</strong> Omicron drove unprecedented demand for COVID-19 testing around the world. As cases have fallen dramatically, so has demand for testing. Demand will continue to decrease over time, and as a result, domestic manufacturers will start ramping down production across the next several weeks and months. Federal investments are a crucial way to preserve the domestic testing manufacturing capacity we have built over the last 15 months. Without these investments, it will take manufacturers months to ramp back up to rebuild capacity, so failure to invest now will leave us with insufficient testing capacity and supply if we see another surge in cases and demand for testing increases once again. This would mean empty store shelves, long lines at testing sites, and slower results which will have life-or-death consequences for people who need to take lifesaving treatments within days of becoming symptomatic. That should not be allowed to happen.</li></ul>



<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Fewer Shots in Arms Around the World:</span></strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>The United States cannot supercharge our effort to get more shots in arms, putting us at greater risk for more variants that may prove to be even more dangerous than the ones we have faced to date.</strong> The U.S. has now delivered over half a billion adult vaccines to 114 countries. Countries need funding and assistance to turn vaccines into vaccinations. Without additional funding for our global response, we will not have resources to help get more shots in arms in countries in need—which is one of the best ways we can prevent future variants. We will also lack funding to provide oxygen and other lifesaving supplies, and our global genomic sequencing capabilities will fall off—undermining our ability to detect any emerging variants around the world.</li></ul>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Washington National Cathedral<br>Washington, D.C.</p>



<p>11:33 A.M. EDT<br> <br>THE PRESIDENT:  Freedom endures against all odds in the face of every aggressor because there are always those who will fight for that freedom.<br> <br>And in the 20th and 21st century, freedom had no greater champion than Madeleine Korbel Albright.<br> <br>Anne, Alice, Katie &#8212; your mom was a force &#8212; a force of nature.  With her goodness and grace, her humanity, and her intellect, she turned the tide of history.<br> <br>David, Daniel, Jack, Jake, Ben, and Ellie &#8212; you’re too young to remember this, but when the Iron Curtain fell and the Berlin Wall came down, our world faced one of those inflection points &#8212; a once-in-a-generation moment of upheaval but opportunity as well.<br> <br>People and nations around the world were deciding the future they wanted to make for themselves.  And your grandmother &#8212; your grandmother &#8212; as Madam Ambassador and as the first female Secretary of State in American history, made sure those nations and those people knew exactly where the United States of America stood &#8212; and what we stood for.<br> <br>You know, and all through it, her beloved sister Kathy and her brother John can attest, she never forgot where she came from or who she was.<br> <br>President Obama, President and Secretary Clinton, Vice President Al Gore, members of Congress, Cabinet members past and present: Today, we honor a truly proud American who made all of us prouder to be Americans.<br> <br>I also want to welcome the distinguished guests and dignitaries who have traveled from around the world to celebrate a daughter of the Czech Republic who knew &#8212; who knew what it meant to endure war and flee persecution.<br> <br>With her friend Vaclav Havel &#8212; when he died, I remember, when Madeleine eulogized him, she used these words, and I quote, “He cast light into places of deepest darkness and reminded us constantly of our obligations to one another.”<br>    <br>These words &#8212; these words apply equally to Madeleine.<br> <br>When I got word that Madeleine had passed, I was in mid-air on my way to Europe to meet with our NATO Allies in Brussels to help try to continue to keep the &#8212; the strong, strong alliances together &#8212; our organization and international response to Russia’s brutal and unjustifiable war against Ukraine.<br> <br>And it was not lost on me that Madeleine was a big part of the reason NATO was still strong and galvanized, as it is today.<br> <br>And a few days later, I traveled to Poland and spoke about all that is at stake in our world and for democracy and freedom &#8212; which is under assault from forces of autocracy and oppression.</p>



<p>Many are tired of hearing me say I think we’re at another inflection point in world history, where there is literally a severe contra- &#8212; confrontation between autocrats and democratic nations.<br>&nbsp;<br>President Clinton &#8212; Bill, it was not lost on me that you spoke at the same Warsaw Castle that I was about to speak at 25 years earlier.<br>&nbsp;<br>In my case, it was evening.&nbsp; The interior of the castle &#8212; a beautiful courtyard &#8212; holds about 5-, 600 people.&nbsp; And mostly Poles and Ukrainians were present when I spoke.&nbsp; And I’m sure many in the audience spoke English, though likely not their first language.<br>&nbsp;<br>But when I mentioned the name &#8212; they were respectful of what I was saying &#8212; but when I mentioned the name of Madeleine Albright, there was a deafening cheer.&nbsp; They all stopped everything and started to cheer.&nbsp; It was spontaneous.&nbsp; It was real.&nbsp; For her name is still synonymous with America as a force for good in the world.<br>&nbsp;<br>Madeleine never minced words or wasted time when she saw something that needed fixing or someone who needed helping.&nbsp; She just got to work.<br>&nbsp;<br>And as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee from the time I was a kid &#8212; God, they were the good old days.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; I &#8212; I was the chairman or the ranking member for a good part of that time.&nbsp; And in the ‘90s, I can attest that Madeleine, with the significant help of the President of the United States, kept the committee really busy.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>In our work to halt genocide in the Balkans, support new democracies in Eastern and Central Europe, to develop Plan Colombia &#8212; in all of those undertakings, Madeleine was an incomparable ally and advisor beyond the President to me and to others on the committee.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>She always had a knack for explaining to the American people why it mattered to them that people everywhere in the world were struggling to breathe free.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And Madeleine didn’t stop when she left government.&nbsp; For decades, she was a nexus of the foreign policy community, always &#8212; and I mean always &#8212; on top of the latest developments, always speaking out for democracy, and always the first to sound the alarm about fascism.<br>&nbsp;<br>Presidents and leaders around the world continued to solicit her advice, including me.&nbsp; When I asked her last year to chair the Defense Policy Board, she built businesses.&nbsp; She pumped out New York Times bestsellers that were both highly prescient and deeply salient &#8212; and constantly bestsellers.&nbsp; I think I’ve read them all.<br>&nbsp;<br>You know, and she &#8212; and she mentored generations of rising foreign policy experts &#8212; the, quote, “foreign policy establishment.”<br>&nbsp;<br>You know &#8212; and the thing that I noted that was deliberate and remarkable about her &#8212; not unlike Secretary Clinton &#8212; was that she made sure that young women knew they belonged at every single table having to do with national security, without exception.<br>&nbsp;<br>Today, across our government and around the world, Madeleine’s protégés are legion.&nbsp; Many are here today, each carrying within them a spark lit by her passion and her brilliance.<br>&nbsp;<br>I think part of the reason why Madeleine was such a successful diplomat was that she understood something I’ve always believed.&nbsp; And my boss, President Obama, when I was Vice President, used to kid me because I’d repeat so often, because I believed she understood something I’ve always believed: that all politics, especially international politics, is personal.&nbsp; It all, ultimately, is personal.<br>&nbsp;<br>She could go toe to toe with the toughest dictators, then turn around and literally teach a fellow ambassador how to do the macarena on the floor of the U.N. Security Council.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; You all think I’m kidding.&nbsp; I’m not kidding.</p>



<p>She thought it was too difficult to teach me how to dance, though.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; She was right.<br>&nbsp;<br>No matter where she was, she understood people.&nbsp; She cared about people.&nbsp; And all of that was grounded in an education gained by watching her father, Josef Korbel &#8212; and her mentor as well.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>She learned diplomacy at the dinner table.&nbsp; And throughout her life, nothing mattered to Madeleine more than the family &#8212; nothing.<br>&nbsp;<br>Madeleine had the same rule that I do and others here do: No matter what’s happening in my day &#8212; as President Obama can tell you &#8212; or who I’m meeting with, if one of my children calls, I take the call.&nbsp; She was the same way.<br>&nbsp;<br>Anne, Alice, Katie, and her grandchildren &#8212; each of you &#8212; each of you is literally a tribute to her enormous &#8212; to her enormous capacity to love.<br>&nbsp;<br>I know it’s hard, but I promise you: She’s always with you &#8212; in your mind, in your heart, and part of your soul.&nbsp; And I promise you: You’re going to have a tough decision, and you’re going to be asking yourself, “What would she want me to do?”&nbsp; Not a joke.&nbsp; Remember I said it.&nbsp; That’s going to happen.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And, Kathy and John, the connection the three of you maintained through your lives was always an anchor to Madeleine<br>through all the ups and downs of life.&nbsp; What a gift.&nbsp; What a gift.&nbsp; What a family.<br>&nbsp;<br>You know, from that first trans-Atlantic crossing on the SS America, to landing in nations around the world in that big blue-and-white plane emblazoned with the words “United States of America,” Madeleine understood her story was America’s story.&nbsp; Her story was America’s story.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>She loved to speak about America as the “indispensable nation.”&nbsp; To her, the phrase was never a statement of arrogance.&nbsp; It was about gratitude for all this country made possible for her.&nbsp; It was a testament to her belief in the endless possibilities that only America could help unlock around the world and to her understanding of what American power could achieve when it was united with and motivated by enduring American values.<br>&nbsp;<br>That’s why there was nothing she loved more than swearing in new citizens to this great nation of ours.&nbsp; She’d light up, reminding them that she had once stood where they stood.<br>&nbsp;<br>Having gained the blessings of liberty, she wanted nothing more than to share them around the globe.<br>&nbsp;<br>To Madeleine, from my prospective, there was no higher mission, no greater honor than to serve this great experiment in freedom known as the United States of America.<br>&nbsp;<br>May her memory continue to be a blessing to our nation, and may we remember her words and her deeds.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>May she always be a light to all those in the darkest places &#8212; a reminder of our obligation to one another.<br>&nbsp;<br>May God bless Madeleine Albright.<br>&nbsp;<br>11:47 A.M.

<p>Throughout America&#8217;s history, workers have sacrificed to grow our food, build our roads, transport our goods, provide care for our neighbors and families, and manufacture the products that are the envy of the world.&nbsp; Our strength and resilience as a Nation is due in no small measure to the strength and resilience of our workers. &nbsp;However, each year, millions of workers get injured or sick doing the work that provides for their families and supports all of ours. &nbsp;Tragically, thousands of workers are killed by preventable workplace accidents and illnesses. &nbsp;The dangers have never been more apparent than during the past 2 years of the pandemic.&nbsp; No worker should risk avoidable injury, illness, or even death in the course of doing their job. &nbsp;Ensuring worker safety is a national priority and a moral imperative. &nbsp;On this Workers Memorial Day, we honor and remember those who lost their lives on the job and reaffirm every worker&#8217;s basic right to a safe and healthy workplace.<br><br>From my first day in office, I have made a priority of building our economy back stronger and empowering and protecting America&#8217;s workers. &nbsp;These priorities are inextricably linked. &nbsp;A stronger economy built from the bottom up and the middle out puts greater power in workers&#8217; hands to improve their lives, provide for their families, and choose higher quality, higher paying, and safer jobs. &nbsp;Greater worker power means that workers have a stronger voice in their workplace, enabling them to advocate for safer working conditions. &nbsp;It also means workers secure a greater share of the economic success they create, which strengthens and expands America&#8217;s middle class &#8212; the backbone of our Nation and our economy.&nbsp;<br><br>Today, workers across the country are beginning the long overdue work of rebuilding our Nation&#8217;s roads and bridges, ports and waterways, public transit and passenger rail systems, and water and sewer lines while expanding electric vehicle charging station networks and broadband internet access in every community.&nbsp; In the coming years, millions of workers will be engaged in those efforts. &nbsp;The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will create new jobs and modernize cities, small towns, and rural and Tribal communities across the country. &nbsp;And we are living up to our commitment that infrastructure jobs will be available to people of all races, genders, and backgrounds in every part of the country.&nbsp; We are committed to ensuring these jobs are safe and subject to high labor standards, including good wages, strong safety and health protections, and the free and fair choice to join or organize a union and collectively bargain with an employer. &nbsp;Through decades of organizing, negotiating, picketing, and protesting, labor unions secured vital workplace protections that union and non-union workers rely on today, and we are working to strengthen both unions and the workplace protections they provide.<br><br>On Workers Memorial Day, we mourn every worker who was lost on the job or from exposure to workplace hazards and join their families and everyone who loved and cared for them in turning pain into purpose.&nbsp; Their memories command us to continue our work toward a future in which no one has to risk their life for a paycheck.&nbsp; We honor the memories of the lives tragically taken from us and remain committed to safeguarding the health and safety of all workers.<br><br>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 28, 2022, as Workers Memorial Day. &nbsp;I call upon all Americans to observe this day with appropriate service, community, and education programs and ceremonies in memory of those killed or injured due to unsafe working conditions.<br><br>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-seventh day of April, in the year of our Lord two&nbsp;thousand&nbsp;twenty-two, and of the Independence of the United&nbsp;States of&nbsp;America the two&nbsp;hundred and forty-sixth.<br>&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-right">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.</p>

<p>The President is announcing five new federal judicial nominees, all of whom are extraordinarily qualified, experienced, and devoted to the rule of law and our Constitution.</p>

She would also be the first openly LGBTQ person to ever serve on that court.<br><br>This is President Biden’s seventeenth round of nominees for federal judicial positions and his fifth slate of nominations in 2022, bringing the number of announced federal judicial nominees to 95.<br><br>President Biden has spent decades committed to strengthening the federal bench, which is why he continues to move rapidly to fill judicial vacancies. And he has won confirmation of the most lower court judges for the first year of a presidency since the Kennedy Administration.</p>

<p>Today, we welcome home Trevor Reed and celebrate his return to the family that missed him dearly. Trevor, a former U.S. Marine, is free from Russian detention. I heard in the voices of Trevor’s parents how much they’ve worried about his health and missed his presence. And I was delighted to be able to share with them the good news about Trevor’s freedom.</p>



<p>I’m grateful for the tireless and dedicated work of Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs Roger Carstens, U.S. Ambassador to the Russian Federation John Sullivan, and many others across our government to ensure that Trevor came home safely. The negotiations that allowed us to bring Trevor home required difficult decisions that I do not take lightly. His safe return is a testament to the priority my Administration places on bringing home Americans held hostage and wrongfully detained abroad. We won’t stop until Paul Whelan and others join Trevor in the loving arms of family and friends.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">James S. Brady Press Briefing Room</p>



<p>3:09 P.M. EDT<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Hi, everyone.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi.&nbsp; How are you?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Today, as promised, we have the premiere of Dr. Ashish Jha, our new White House COVID Response Coordinator, in the briefing room.<br><br>Dr. Jha will be talking about two important pieces of work in our &#8212; we are working on with Congress: first, expanding access to lifesaving COVID-19 treatments; and second, our urgent need for funding from Congress.</p>



<p>He has time just to take a very small number of questions today, but he will be &#8212; come back af- &#8212; soon, I’m sure.<br><br>So, with that, I will turn it over to him, and then we’ll proceed with a normal briefing.</p>



<p>DR. JHA:&nbsp; Good afternoon, everybody.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Good afternoon.</p>



<p>DR. JHA:&nbsp; All right.&nbsp; Well, it’s great to be with all of you.&nbsp; A little exciting and a little scary to be with this crowd.&nbsp; (Laughter.)</p>



<p>So I want to take a minute to talk about where we are with the pandemic.&nbsp; We are &#8212; I believe we are at an inflection point.&nbsp; On one hand, we know that BA.2, the subvariant of Omicron, has become dominant; cases are rising across the country.&nbsp; But hospitalizations are at the lowest level of the pandemic &#8212; right? &#8212; and deaths are continuing to fall.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re down to about 300 deaths a day &#8212; still too many, still too high, but doing so much for the &#8212; better than we have throughout much of this pandemic.</p>



<p>Despite all of that progress &#8212; and I think a lot of that is driven by the fact that we have more than 200 million Americans vaccinated, more than 100 million Americans boosted &#8212; we know this virus is tricky.&nbsp;<br><br>We know that the risk of potential surges, even of a potential new variant, remains out there.<br><br>The good news is we are at a point where we have a lot more capabilities, a lot more tools to protect the American people: testing, vaccines, therapeutics.&nbsp; These are the &#8212; sort of the pillars of how we manage the rest of this pandemic.<br><br>And that&#8217;s why what I want to do is spend some time talking to you about those tools, about our capabilities, what we&#8217;re doing as an administration, and what we need from Congress to continue to protect the American people.</p>



<p>So, first, I want to talk about Paxlovid, the &#8212; the therapy that is become &#8212; is becoming increasingly available to the American people.</p>



<p>For those of you who have not followed this very closely, Paxlovid became authorized by the FDA in late December.&nbsp; At that point, there was just a very limited supply of these pills.</p>



<p>The clinical data suggests that it has an enormously beneficial impact, reduces hospitalizations by more than 90 percent, and is very, very effective at preventing severe disease.</p>



<p>Over the last few months, the administration has worked very hard with Pfizer to increase the supply of Paxlovid and acquire more and more doses for the American people.</p>



<p>And now our job is to make sure that these doses are getting out there and they&#8217;re getting into &#8212; into the hands of patients who would benefit from them.</p>



<p>So, what are we doing?&nbsp; And I want to talk about four major things.</p>



<p>The first is: We are opening up the number of sites that can order directly from the federal government supplies of Paxlovid.</p>



<p>Until &#8212; until this recent change, the way pharmacies got Paxlovid &#8212; either you were a Test to Treat site or you got it from your state.&nbsp; But now we&#8217;re opening up a federal ha- &#8212; a federal pharmacy channel.&nbsp; And what that means is pharmacies can order directly from the federal government.</p>



<p>Currently, there are about 20,000 sites in the United States that carry Paxlovid.&nbsp; We expect with this change that we will very quickly get to 30,000.&nbsp; And within the next couple of weeks, I expect us to get to about 40,000 sites.</p>



<p>Paxlovid will be widely available everywhere in America.&nbsp; That&#8217;s going to help a lot.</p>



<p>The second is: The President announced the Test to Treat effort that we have launched.&nbsp; Right now, there are about 2,200 Test to Treat sites across the country.&nbsp; And we are going to make a series of efforts to expand the number of Test to Treat sites, including new federal initiatives that will allow for us to build on other federal testing sites to allow for &#8212; for those to also have a treatment component.&nbsp; So if you test positive, you can go and get treated with Paxlovid, of course if you are eligible and deemed so by a &#8212; by a provider.</p>



<p>Third is: We really are doubling down on our communication and education efforts with physicians and other prescribers.</p>



<p>In the beginning, when the &#8212; when the &#8212; when Paxlovid first became available, the word on the street was these things are not widely available, you should restrict it to the highest risk patients.&nbsp; Too many physicians still have that mindset, and what we need to do is to help American physicians and nurse practitioners and others who can prescribe understand that we now have plenty available.&nbsp; And anybody who is eligible, anybody who&#8217;s high risk, should be getting Paxlovid, obviously based &#8212; as long as they meet the clinical criteria.&nbsp; And so that education campaign is going to be really important.</p>



<p>And then last but certainly not least is we&#8217;re ramping up our public awareness campaign so that patients also understand that if they test positive, they should consider going to a Test to Treat site or reach out to their physician, but to get assessed for whether Paxlovid would be useful for them.</p>



<p>Those are all really critical steps that I think are going to make an enormous difference in getting more Paxlovid out to the community, to getting it out to patients.&nbsp; And with a very simple goal &#8212; right? &#8212; which is we want to lower the severity of the disease that people get if they get infected, and we want to lower hospitalizations, we want to lower deaths.<br><br>Paxlovid is a really important step in our ability to fight this pandemic.</p>



<p>Treatments like these vaccines that we have developed &#8211;these are the key, essential tools that we&#8217;re going to need to get through the rest of this pandemic.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s the second part of the conversation I want to have with all of you, because all of this requires funding from Congress.</p>



<p>So far, Congress has not stepped up to provide the funds that are needed for our most urgent needs.</p>



<p>Now, I know they were off on a two-week recess; they are back.&nbsp; I&#8217;m looking forward to working with Congress &#8212; we all are &#8212; to get the funding needs of the American people met on this &#8212; on the issue of COVID and COVID treatments.</p>



<p>Let me give you a couple of concrete examples of what will happen if we do not get the funding we need.</p>



<p>You may have heard, if you&#8217;ve been tracking this, that FDA is working with Moderna and Pfizer, looking at what the next generation of vaccines may look like.&nbsp; And it is possible that we may get a whole new generation of vaccines in the fall or winter that may be more effective and more durable.</p>



<p>None of those are going to be available to the American people if we don&#8217;t get more funding.</p>



<p>We are tracking new treatments that are coming online that are as effective, maybe even more effective, with fewer side effects.&nbsp;Those treatments will not be available to Americans because other countries are stepping up and making purchases for those treatments while we await funding from Congress.</p>



<p>The bottom line is that none of us can predict with any certainty where exactly this pandemic is going, what the virus is going to do next.&nbsp; All we can do is prepare.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s what we need Congress to do, is to help us prepare and be ready for whatever eventuality comes.</p>



<p>Let me make one last point that I want to &#8212; think is incredibly important, and that is that there are some people in this country who sometimes think that we can take a domestic-only approach to a global pandemic.&nbsp; That&#8217;s not a thing.&nbsp; You can&#8217;t do that.</p>



<p>If we&#8217;re going to fight a global pandemic, we have to have a global approach.&nbsp; That means we need funding to ensure that we&#8217;re getting shots in arms around the world.</p>



<p>The President and his leadership has enabled us to now have plenty of vaccines for the world.&nbsp; But vaccines don&#8217;t save lives, right?&nbsp; Vaccinations do.&nbsp; We have got to finish the job.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve got to get the resources we need to get shots in arms so we can actually vaccinate the world and help bring this pandemic to a close.</p>



<p>So those are &#8212; those are the essential things that are in front of us.&nbsp; This will require a partnership between the administration and Congress.&nbsp; I am confident that Congress will deliver for the American people.&nbsp; And I look forward to working with them on that.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Chris.</p>



<p>DR. JHA:&nbsp; Every time a high-profile person, like the Vice President, catches COVID, there’s more attention on the infection.&nbsp; For Americans following that news, what lessons should they draw from that experience if somebody as protected as her has caught COVID?<br><br>DR. JHA:&nbsp; Good question.&nbsp; So I think if you take a step back and look at the Vice President, she is boosted &#8212; she’s actually twice boosted.&nbsp; Right?<br><br>We have a very, very contagious variant out there.&nbsp; It is going to be hard to ensure that no one gets COVID in America.&nbsp; That&#8217;s not even a policy goal.</p>



<p>The goal of our policies should be, obviously, minimize&nbsp;infections whenever possible, but to make sure people don’t get seriously ill.&nbsp;<br><br>The best ways of doing that are making sure people are vaccinated and boosted, as the Vice President is, and making sure we have plenty of therapeutics so, you know &#8212; so that that is available as well.&nbsp; And that, to me, is the key lesson here.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Has she received any therapeutics?&nbsp; Since we’re on the topic of therapeutics.<br><br>DR. JHA:&nbsp; You know, that&#8217;s a conversation that she&#8217;s having with her physician.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not her physician; I&#8217;m not privy to those conversations.&nbsp; So I don&#8217;t know the answer to that.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Cecilia.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Dr. Jha.&nbsp; Welcome to the briefing room, by the way.<br><br>DR. JHA:&nbsp; Thank you.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To your point that so many Americans can and will get this: In this report that just came out today, that 60 percent of Americans have had &#8212; it appears have had COVID, the President is getting ready to ramp up his travel schedule; the Vice President just caught it.&nbsp; She&#8217;s twice boosted.&nbsp; Should Americans be prepared for a time when President Biden gets this?&nbsp; Is it just a matter of time that the President could get COVID?<br><br>DR. JHA:&nbsp; I wouldn&#8217;t say it&#8217;s “just a matter of time.”&nbsp; But of course, it is possible that the President, like any other American, could get COVID.&nbsp;<br><br>The bottom line is: He is vaccinated and boosted.&nbsp; He is very well protected.&nbsp; He&#8217;s got very good protocols around him to protect him from getting infected.&nbsp; But there is no 100 percent anything.&nbsp; And I think the key focus has got to be: We got to continue protecting the President.&nbsp; That&#8217;s what the protocols around him are designed to do.<br><br>Yeah, let me just &#8212; let me leave it at that.&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Tam.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; Part of the congressional funding is to potentially deal with the uninsured fund that has run out of money.&nbsp; What does the uninsured fund, not having any money in it, mean for Paxlovid?&nbsp; Or if someone who&#8217;s uninsured gets COVID right now, what does that mean for them?<br><br>DR. JHA:&nbsp; Yeah, so first of all, Paxlovid itself will be free, because the &#8212;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They have to see a doctor?&nbsp; Or &#8212;<br><br>DR. JHA:&nbsp; They have to see a &#8212; someone who can actually prescribe it for them.&nbsp; And this is &#8212; one of the absolutely critical things in a pandemic is that people need to be able to access healthcare.&nbsp; It turns out it&#8217;s also critical not in a pandemic.&nbsp; Right?&nbsp;<br><br>But &#8212; but particularly in a pandemic with an infectious disease, it&#8217;s really important that people be able to access healthcare services, get the care they need.&nbsp; It&#8217;s good for them; it&#8217;s good for people around them.&nbsp; And so, making sure uninsured people have access is absolutely critical.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, right now, what does that look like?&nbsp; If someone gets COVID and they&#8217;re uninsured, are they able to get treatment?&nbsp; Are they able to get tests?&nbsp; Or does CVS just eat the cost?&nbsp; How does that work right now?&nbsp;<br><br>DR. JHA:&nbsp; So, I think, right now, because we don&#8217;t have the funding, there&#8217;s a little bit of patchwork of what is happening.&nbsp; There are obviously places that serve uninsured people &#8212; community health centers, others people can get care.&nbsp; There are still &#8212; people are still going to CVS and other places that still are offering those services.&nbsp; But that&#8217;s not a sustainable solution.&nbsp; Right?<br><br>So, right now, we&#8217;re in this kind of middle ground where people are still getting care.&nbsp; But over time, if Congress continues to not fund these urgent priorities, it&#8217;s going to get harder and harder for people to access care.&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Kristen.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; This will be the last one too.&nbsp; I apologize.&nbsp; He’ll be back soon.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Dr. Jha.&nbsp; Thank you so much for being here.&nbsp; Just a couple of questions.&nbsp; One, can you tell us: Was President Biden tested today, and has he tested negative?&nbsp; Do we know the last time he tested negative?&nbsp;<br><br>DR. JHA:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not involved in the President&#8217;s testing protocols.&nbsp; So I am &#8212; I just don&#8217;t know the answer to the question.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; He was tested yesterday, and he tested negative.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; On Paxlovid, I just want to be crystal clear, because you&#8217;re trying to expand access to it, but you still say “if people meet the medical requirements.”<br><br>DR. JHA:&nbsp; Yeah.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does that mean that Paxlovid should only be taken by people of a certain age and who are immunocompromised, or that it should be taken by anyone who has symptoms?<br><br>DR. JHA:&nbsp; No.&nbsp; So &#8212; so, neither.&nbsp; FDA has laid out a very clear set of criteria for who should get Paxlovid, and, very basically, it&#8217;s anybody who&#8217;s at high risk of developing complications.&nbsp; And the FDA points to a CDC assessment.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a &#8212; it&#8217;s a long list.&nbsp; I can read it all to you, but, of course, age is important, presence of chronic diseases.&nbsp;<br><br>But the bottom line is that &#8212; and what I am recommending to family and friends is &#8212; if you get COVID, you should see a provider and make that assessment with your provider.&nbsp; A lot more people are eligible and bene- &#8212; would benefit than I think people think.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And just very quickly, can you help us to understand this moment that we are in?&nbsp; Because on the one hand, cases are going up, particularly on the East Coast.&nbsp; As you have said, hospitalization and deaths are going down.&nbsp; But is the country in the midst of a surge?<br><br>DR. JHA:&nbsp; What I would say is, you know, we are going to see cases go up and go down during this pandemic as we &#8212; as we head into the mont- &#8212; weeks, months, and years ahead.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>The key things that we need to be following are: “Are healthcare systems getting stressed?”&nbsp; “Are people ending up in the hospital with severe illness?”&nbsp; Obviously, “Are people dying at high rates?”&nbsp; Those are the &#8212; in my mind, the most important metrics.<br><br>And right now, while infection numbers are rising &#8212; and, of course, we all want to see infection numbers coming down &#8212; the good news is, because of the extraordinary work of this administration, we&#8217;ve got Americans much better protected.&nbsp; And that means that we&#8217;re not seeing a huge bump in hospitalizations, that deaths are still declining.&nbsp; Obviously, we want to continue tracking those metrics.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Thank you, Dr. Jha.&nbsp; You’re invited anytime.<br><br>DR. JHA:&nbsp; All right.&nbsp; Thank you, everybody.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Dr. Jha.&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Thank you.<br><br>Okay, a couple items at the top.&nbsp;<br><br>Today &#8212; we announced this morning that during Second Chance Month, President Biden made a number of announcements focused on second chances and reentry, which, as leaders on both sides of the aisle recognize, will help prevent and reduce crime and strengthen our communities.<br><br>The President announced 75 sentence commutations and 3 full pardons.&nbsp; All of these individuals were convicted of non-violent drug offenses, and many have been successfully serving their time on home confinement.<br><br>He also announced more than 20 major actions from a dozen agencies to expand second-chance opportunities.&nbsp; This includes a first-of-its-kind partnership between the Department of Justice and the Department of Labor to invest $145 million in job training and intensive reentry in federal prisons.&nbsp; It also includes steps that will make more incarcerated students eligible for Pell Grants, make it easier for those who were incarcerated to enroll in Medicare, and help formerly incarcerated veterans get their benefits restored.<br><br>As we speak, Susan Rice, Dana Remus, and Cedric Richmond are holding a virtual roundtable with six formerly incarcerated individuals to discuss the President’s first clemency announcement, the new reentry policies and programs we announced today.<br><br>Today’s announcement mark import- &#8212; marks important progress, and we will continue to review &#8212; the President will continue to review clemency petitions and deliver reforms that advance equal justice and public safety.<br><br>I also wanted to note that, today, Secretary Austin &#8212; you may have seen &#8212; hosted a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Consultative Group with ministers of defense and chiefs of defense from more than 40 countries at Ramstein Air Base in Germany.<br><br>The goal is to bring together countries from around the world for a series of meetings on the latest Ukraine defense needs to help Ukraine win the fight against Russia’s unjust invasion, and to help Ukraine’s defenses for tomorrow’s challenges.<br><br>As Secretary Austin said, it was an important and constructive day.&nbsp; Agenda topics today included near-time &#8212; near-term priorities and longer-term planning; the latest battlefield assessments of the renewed Russian offensive; establishing a framework for prioritizing requirements and logistics for resupply; and energizing the defense industrial base to continue the steady flow of security assistance.<br><br>More than 30 countries have now stepped up to meet Ukraine’s urgent needs and have committed more than $5 billion of equipment, including $3.7 billion from the United States, to support Ukraine’s defenses.&nbsp;<br><br>We also wanted to welcome an important announcement by our German allies today to send Ukraine some 50 Cheetah anti-aircraft systems.&nbsp;<br><br>We would also highlight the British government’s announcement yesterday that it will provide Ukraine with additional anti-aircraft capabilities and Canada’s announcement that it will send Ukraine armored vehicles.<br><br>I believe that’s it.&nbsp; Why don’t we jump around to people who didn’t get questions initially.&nbsp;<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; A quick question on Dr. Jha talking about cases going up and the VP testing positive.&nbsp; Can you talk a little bit about whether the administration and society as a whole perhaps have moved away a bit too quickly from mitigation efforts such as masking?&nbsp; And is the administration perhaps thinking about strengthening any of those measures, especially the ones that were loosened?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, those decisions and those recommendations are made by the CDC and our public health officials.&nbsp; So I don&#8217;t have anything to preview for you.&nbsp; Those are decisions that they make, and we obviously abide by that from here.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>I&#8217;d remind you that their recommendations include &#8212; are based on what zone of the country you live in &#8212; right? &#8212; whether it is a green zone, a yellow zone, or a zone that has a higher rate. &nbsp;And they continue to recommend masking on transportation on fed- &#8212; you know, that we &#8212; and we abide by that from here as well.<br><br>So, I don&#8217;t have any changes on that to preview.<br><br>But as Dr. Jha noted, our focus &#8212; and as we noted when we rolled out our 100-page plan &#8212; continues to be on tracking and reducing hospitalizations and deaths.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re certainly aware that a very &#8212; with a very transmissible variant, that there &#8212; we expect that there could be case increases, as we&#8217;ve seen over the last few weeks with BA.2.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, even in the regions that are witnessing a surge, I mean, there is &#8212; there are no discussions that perhaps you can talk about &#8212; about, you know, what these latest, sort of, surge in cases could potentially lead to?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, but masking requirements change depending on what the numbers look like in your community.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right.&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; And a quick one on the EU.&nbsp; Reuters is reporting that the EU plans to declare that it is entering a new post-emergency phase for COVID.&nbsp; Given, sort of, the uptick in cases in the U.S., I&#8217;m wondering if you can talk a little bit about that timing.&nbsp; I mean, is that unusual?&nbsp; Or do you think it is the right time for the &#8212; for countries around the world to be headed towards that goal, and if the U.S. is perhaps considering announcing something similar going forward?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don’t &#8212; you mean an end of the emergency?&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have anything to preview.&nbsp; Again, those recommendations are made by our public health and medical experts, so we rely on them for their guidance on that.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And can I ask one on Ukraine?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, just earlier today, the announcement from Germany on a new package for heavier weapons &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That obviously comes, you know, as Russia has said that such assistance would lead to a nuclear war.&nbsp; And it sort of seemed like the U.S. was brushing off Russia&#8217;s recent nuclear threat.&nbsp; And I&#8217;m wondering if the administration &#8212; to what extent is it really taking this latest threat seriously?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I think you heard some of our national security officials make clear there&#8217;s no winning a nuclear war.&nbsp; And obviously, our objective continues to be to call on reducing the rhetoric, on taking the rhetoric on that front down.<br><br>And I think there have been some officials who have abided by that.&nbsp; But I would note that the announcement by Germany is in line with announcements we&#8217;ve seen by a number of European countries in providing assistance they have never before provided, which is part of the significance here.&nbsp;<br><br>So, this is an unprecedented change to provide lethal aid to another country, and that&#8217;s the significance here from Germany.&nbsp; But I&#8217;d also note that Norway provided Mistral anti-air missiles, that a number of countries have provided types of assistance that they have never done in the past.&nbsp; And that really speaks to the signi- &#8212; the unity of NATO, of European countries in confronting what we see as, of course, a horrific war in Ukraine launched by the Russians.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it possible that there might be any updates to protocols &#8212; COVID protocols within the White House in light of Vice President Harris testing positive for COVID?&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I would not expect that, no.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So there have been no discussions, and you don&#8217;t expect that for the time being?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I think it&#8217;s important to remember that we have stringent protocols here that go over and above CDC recommendations, even as it relates to how long you stay at home if you test positive.&nbsp; So, individuals who test positive for &#8212; here &#8212; and I can speak to this two times over.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; There you go.&nbsp; You don&#8217;t return to work until you have &#8212; you have received a negative test.&nbsp; If that is before 10 days, you are still going to be masking.&nbsp; That is beyond what CDC protocols are.&nbsp;<br><br>There&#8217;s a regular testing cadence.&nbsp; Obviously, the Vice President was tested this morning because of that regular testing cadence.&nbsp; And for the rest of us, anyone who&#8217;s going to be around the President, to travel with him, to see him in the Oval Office is tested that day.&nbsp; And even if you&#8217;re not going to see him, you&#8217;re on a regular testing cadence around here.<br><br>We also take the step to socially distance in meetings as frequently as we can.&nbsp; And also, a number of us have chosen to wear masks in meetings as well just as an additional step and protocol.&nbsp;<br><br>So those have been in place prior to today, and we will continue to abide by those moving forward.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And just on a different topic: Senator Manchin told reporters this morning that there is not a Build Back Better revival.&nbsp; He said that social spending programs, he believes, should go through a regular order, not through the reconciliation process.&nbsp; I wondered if you could explain just from the White House&#8217;s perspective how you all are thinking about reconciliation versus regular order, in terms of wanting to get done some of the President&#8217;s top legislative priorities.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, you&#8217;ve heard the President say many times that he believes that a lot of the objectives he has should be achievable through bipartisan work together.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not Democrats to &#8212; you know, Democrats shouldn&#8217;t be able to own efforts to reduce prescription drug costs or the ability to negotiate the price of prescription drugs, nor should we be the ones completely owning, on our own, efforts to lower the cost of childcare or healthcare.&nbsp; Those aren&#8217;t Democratic ideals.&nbsp; Those should be &#8212; those are &#8212; those are proposals that are broadly supported by many Americans across the country.&nbsp;<br><br>So, we &#8212; we know that Senator Manchin has, of course, talked about his efforts to pursue a bipartisan package or bipartisan plan as it relates to energy costs, and we&#8217;re not going to prejudge that effort.&nbsp; But we&#8217;re going to continue to engage with a broad range of Democrats, including, of course, Senator Manchin about how to get the President&#8217;s agenda done.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And is there anything you can tell us about the President&#8217;s schedule today?&nbsp; There wasn&#8217;t anything publicly announced.&nbsp; Is he in touch with members of Congress, particularly since they&#8217;re coming back this week?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I expect he will have a range of conversations and engagements with members of Congress.&nbsp; He also has a range of internal meetings, policy meetings, planning meetings.&nbsp; There&#8217;s nothing more I can preview on that from here.&nbsp; But if &#8212; if there&#8217;s more I can tell you after the briefing, I&#8217;m happy to do that.<br><br>Go ahead, Weijia.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll start with something else Senator Manchin said &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; since we’re just talking about him.&nbsp; He said today: We need an immigration policy, and Title 42 should not be done away with until we get an immigration policy or until the CDC basically says we no longer have a health crisis.&nbsp; What does it say about the communication with members of the President&#8217;s own party that Senator Manchin believes that Title 42 is an immigration tool?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I can&#8217;t speak to that necessarily.&nbsp; I can tell you that &#8212; what it is and isn&#8217;t.&nbsp; It is not an immigration tool; it is a health authority and one the CDC &#8212; our health experts, of course &#8212; do have authority to make a decision about. And they&#8217;ve made the decision that the conditions no longer exist to keep Title 42 in place.<br><br>We do agree with him.&nbsp; Absolutely, there should be an immigration policy, and there should be immigration reforms, and they are long overdue.&nbsp; And we&#8217;d love to work with him and any other members on moving that forward.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does it concern you that he&#8217;s saying that Title 42 should not be done away with until there is an immigration policy?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, that&#8217;s just not how it works.&nbsp; Obviously, Title 42 is &#8212; the authority was given to the CDC by Congress.&nbsp; They made a decision.&nbsp; If Congress wants to decide &#8212; make any decisions about the next steps for Title 42, they can work together on that.&nbsp; But that is an authority or a decision that have to &#8212; would have to lay in the body that he works in.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Oh, go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; I have a follow-up on what Dr. Jha said about Test to Treat sites.&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the administration doing to expand those sites, including converting some testing sites to have a treatment component?&nbsp; What are the challenges to that?&nbsp; And do you have any timeframe for when you expect to ramp up those facilities?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a really good question, Weijia.&nbsp; I’ll probably have to talk to Dr. Jha and others from the healthcare team about it.&nbsp; And next time, he’ll take more questions, I promise.&nbsp;<br><br>You are right, there are some challenges, just like any aspect of applying COVID policy or COVID treatment policies or COVID &#8212; efforts to fight COVID policies, in that we have to educate a large swatch of public, including healthcare providers, about this works or how it would work.&nbsp; There is continued efforts to do that, but I&#8217;m happy to check with them on expansion plans or how that might work.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then just one more quick one on vaccines for children under five.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The group Protect their Future is just one of many groups that are urging the FDA to consider Moderna’s application for an EUA before June, which is when Pfizer will also submit theirs.&nbsp; What is your response to these groups who are concerned that appears &#8212; concerned that it appears the administration is doing Pfizer a favor by waiting to consider both Moderna and Pfizer at the same time, when Moderna’s data is already ready for review by the end of this week?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I&#8217;d really point you to the FDA for their decision-making process.&nbsp; But I would tell you that, of course, as a parent of a child under five, I&#8217;m eager to have vaccines approved and available, and I want to make sure they go through the proper protocols and process.&nbsp; But I would point you to the FDA.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And on clemency &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; there are 18,000 petitions pending for clemency.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the President planning to increase his pace for consideration as he talked about possibly doing?&nbsp; And also, is there consideration about a permanent clemency review process that would, you know, kind of institutionalize this process going forward?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, first, let me &#8212; it&#8217;s important to note that the President has issued more sentence commutations at this early point in his presidency than any of the la- &#8212; his last five predecessors at the same point in their first terms.<br><br>So we are far ahead of anyone, any of the last five Presidents.&nbsp; That is because this is a priority to the President.&nbsp; And as I noted, when I &#8212; at the top of this briefing, he feels this is &#8212; second chances are important, and he believes this is absolutely a right step in our justice system.&nbsp;<br><br>He is &#8212; he&#8217;s going to continue to review clemency petitions, and that is going to be an ongoing process.&nbsp; That is, of course, run through our Counsel&#8217;s Office.&nbsp; So it doesn&#8217;t stop here; it will be ongoing, and there will be more in the future.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.&nbsp; On Title 42, we&#8217;ve heard you guys say that this is a public health order, it&#8217;s not an immigration order, it&#8217;s the CDC’s decision.&nbsp; But yesterday, members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, who met with the President, relayed some of what he expressed in that meeting.&nbsp; And one of them said that the President told the group that he was looking forward to lifting Title 42, describing it as an excuse to keep people out of the country and anti-immigrant.&nbsp; Is the President really wanting Title 42 to go away because it was a Trump-era policy?&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, the President has never felt that Title 42 was a &#8212; an effective immigration policy, and he talked about that during the campaign.&nbsp; But the authority has always rested in the CDC to make that determination.&nbsp; And he left the CDC to make that determination, unlike his predecessor, about a range of decisions.&nbsp;<br><br>So, the President has never &#8212; never made a secret of the fact that he thinks immigration reform is necessary and that Title 42 was never a replacement for comprehensive immigration reform that would put in place smarter security, that would ensure there was an asylum processing system that worked.&nbsp; And that is something he would be eager to work with anyone on to get done.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So if this &#8212; conditions warranted it, would the White House want to see the CDC reimpose Title 42 in the instance that the cases are up and the metrics that they use to measure that warrant that decision?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, the CDC, again, has the authority to make a determination about what the health conditions warrant, so we will leave it to them to make any decisions or recommendations.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, with the Vice President being out &#8212; obviously, she&#8217;s broken a lot of ties for votes &#8212; and then we have senators; I believe Warre- &#8212; Wyden and Murphy also out &#8212; is there any concern about ability to get confirmations through this week with her absence?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would say there are also some Democrats who have announced that they have also tested positive for COVID.&nbsp; You may be referring to the Federal Reserve nominees or others.&nbsp; That is something that members and leaders will work through in Congress.&nbsp; We are confident we have the votes to get them confirmed.&nbsp; We&#8217;re eager to have them in place.&nbsp; But, of course, we need all of people &#8212; all members there to do that.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then I had one follow-up on Dr. Jha &#8212; something that he said earlier.&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We’ve talked about the administration surging resources to the border &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; including resources to vaccinate migrants.&nbsp; And the last time I asked about this, I believe your answer was something along the lines of, “We have enough funding and supply to take care of the 23 sites that DHS is going to be running to get migrants vaccinated and also take care of uninsured Americans.”&nbsp; But it sounded, in his answer, like that might not be the case anymore.&nbsp; So are we in a place now where there might be a choice where people would have to choose or the administration would have to choose between supplying resources to migrants coming across the border versus taking care of uninsured Americans?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I&#8217;m happy to check on those resources, Jacqui.&nbsp; I would say that our broad concern about COVID funding is based on a couple of issues that he talked about.&nbsp; One of them is making sure that we are ahead of the world on being able to order ahead, primarily, a lot of different treatments that will help ensure that we have the best vaccines, the best boosters, enough supply once individuals under 50 are eligible.&nbsp;<br><br>And certainly, we want to keep all of our programs running across the country.&nbsp; But &#8212;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I just have one more on the Hunter Biden reporting that we&#8217;ve seen come out.&nbsp; Does the President still maintain that he never spoke with his son about his business dealings? And given this reporting on Eric Schwerin, does he also say that he has never spoken to his son&#8217;s business partners about his son&#8217;s business dealings?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; He maintains his same statements that he&#8217;s made in the past.&nbsp; I would say &#8212; I know you&#8217;re referring to WAVES records that were released more than 10 years ago.&nbsp; I really don&#8217;t have more detail or information on them.&nbsp; I&#8217;d note that there was a gap when WAVES records were not released, but I don&#8217;t have more information about visits from more than 10 years ago.&nbsp;<br><br>Go ahead.&nbsp; Oh, well, let me go around to people who haven&#8217;t gotten &#8212; go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, thanks.&nbsp; Two questions on the war on Ukraine.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First of all, on food aid &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; does the administration have any idea of how much<br>money you&#8217;ll need yet for global food aid, given the shortfalls into the war on Ukraine?&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; So &#8212; well, let me first say that we are not expecting a food shortage here at home, but we are acting to bolster food security around the globe, both unilaterally and in conjunction with allies and partners.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>One of the steps we&#8217;re taking is we&#8217;re really conducting extensive diplomacy to encourage all countries to refrain from export restrictions and excessive stockpiling &#8212; obviously, buying up or not exporting goods or products they would normally do &#8212; because it can exacerbate supply chall- &#8212; chain challenges and price inflation.&nbsp; And we want to consider how to expand production of key areas where we could see that happening: oil seeds and associated commodities.&nbsp;<br><br>We&#8217;re also working through multilateral channels, including the G7, to provide a range of funding to the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program.&nbsp; A $1.7 billion multilateral financing mechanism is part of what we&#8217;ve done there that has helped the world&#8217;s poorest countries increase investments in agriculture and food security as we&#8217;re anticipating global &#8212; shortages in some regions of the world.&nbsp;<br><br>And through Feed the Future, our new nutrition commitments, we&#8217;re also committing over $11 billion over the next five years to address food security threats and nutrition across the globe in addition to the over $4 billion in humanitarian assistance funding.<br><br>So we&#8217;ve taken a number of steps &#8212; funding mechanisms &#8212; you know, multilateral financing mechanisms; also contributing and trying to use through diplomatic channels, you know, efforts to prevent stockpiling and decreasing of exports, because we anticipate it could be an issue, and we&#8217;re already seeing that in some parts of the world.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; So no idea what the global overall total would be for how much food &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t think we have a prediction of that at this point.&nbsp; So what we&#8217;re trying to do is we&#8217;re trying to get ahead of what we anticipate being&nbsp;a shortage or an impact in some parts of the world and working through multilateral mechanisms to help address that, even as we don&#8217;t foresee it being a food shortage issue here.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then on natural gas, Russia says it&#8217;s going to cut off Poland starting tomorrow, which is a pretty big escalation by Russia.&nbsp; Is the administration concerned that Gazprom might cut off other European nations from &#8212; to get natural gas supplies?&nbsp; And is the U.S. going to do anything to help Poland make up for &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; shortages there?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Let me check and see if there&#8217;s anything specific to Poland.&nbsp; What I can tell you &#8212; and we&#8217;ve talked about the little bit in &#8212; a little bit in here before &#8212; is that for the last several months, and even prior to the invasion, we have been working to increase natural gas supply and options to European countries that have been reliant on Russia for natural gas supply in anticipation of the possibility of this happening or a decrease in what they&#8217;re providing.<br><br>So, some of that has been asking some countries in Asia who have excess supply to provide that to Europe.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve done that in some cases. &nbsp;And it&#8217;s been an ongoing effort, but I can see if there&#8217;s anything specific for Poland, given this recent announcement.<br><br>Go ahead, Matt.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Two questions on the pardons.&nbsp; There were &#8212; pardons and commutations.&nbsp; There were three pardons; two of them were for nonviolent drug offenses.&nbsp; Can you talk at all about, sort of, what it was about those two cases that stuck out to the President, given that there are a lot of people who applied for pardons that have similar circumstances and didn&#8217;t receive a pardon today?&nbsp; Is there anything about those two that are emblematic of anything that is on his &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; Well, I think many of you reported on these cases and the compelling nature of their personal stories.&nbsp; But I would note that his focus at this point in time was on individuals who had less than four years to serve.&nbsp; A number of them &#8212; a good percentage of them, and I can find the exact number in here &#8212; are also already under home confinement currently.<br><br>And this is, again, just the first step.&nbsp; And he will continue to review clemency requests and petitions over the course of his presidency and, certainly, in the coming months.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, in addition, there is a large backlog of people who have applied for pardons and commutations.&nbsp; And given that, was there any denials in this first wave?&nbsp; Is he denying anybody a pardon or a commutation this &#8212;&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; It&#8217;s a good question.&nbsp; I&#8217;m happy to check with our counsel&#8217;s office and see or if it was just &#8212; this was the first round that was granted through the process.<br><br>Go ahead, Sheryl.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two questions, Jen.&nbsp; First, following up on Dr. Jha, he said that &#8212; he talked about global funding &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; for the coronavirus pandemic.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Republicans have said that they want that money offset.&nbsp; So, has the administration &#8212; does the administration intend to propose ways to offset that $5 billion?&nbsp; Or do you think that&#8217;s a lost cause?<br><br>And, second, the President has a number of crowded events coming up on his calendar &#8212; a couple of funerals, the White House Correspondents’ Dinner.&nbsp; And in light of the Vice President&#8217;s diagnosis, can you talk about the calculations that the President is making and thinking about whether to attend these kinds of events, and also whether he has any special obligation as President to keep himself safe?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; Well, on the first question, Sheryl, we&#8217;re not quite there yet.&nbsp; I mean, we have requested 22.5 in the past, and obviously, that is where our emergency requests will be moving forward for the short-term needs that we have.&nbsp;<br><br>This has been passed &#8212; past COVID funding, as you well know, has been passed through emergency authorities where it hasn&#8217;t been offset.&nbsp; And we certainly think that&#8217;s reasonable.&nbsp; But we&#8217;re at such the early stage of this process, having not even sent it up to the Hill yet, we&#8217;re going to have to have all of those conversations about how to move it forward.<br><br>On the second piece, what I will tell you is that we make risk assessments here, just like every American does, and as it relates to, of course, keeping the President safe and all of us safe.<br><br>Now, naturally, he has access to the best healthcare in the world.&nbsp; He consults closely with his doctor.&nbsp; We take a range of steps &#8212; I noted in response to MJ’s question earlier &#8212; that go beyond even most workplaces in the country in terms of required testing for those who &#8212; who will be around him, social distancing.&nbsp; Obviously, he has his own regular testing cadence.<br><br>But we do make assessments and he makes assessments about when he feels it&#8217;s important for him to attend or participate in an event.&nbsp; And you&#8217;ve mentioned two of them &#8212; obviously, this weekend, he&#8217;ll be attending the White House Correspondents’ Dinner.&nbsp; It&#8217;s an opportunity to honor the work of all of you and many of your colleagues and to &#8212; and to talk about the importance of journalism in the world.<br><br>That&#8217;s an event he&#8217;s attended many times in the past, and he made a decision, through consultations, that it was an event he could attend and wanted to attend again.<br><br>And obviously, former Vice President Mondale is someone he had an important personal relationship with.&nbsp; He wanted to attend his memorial service.<br><br>Obviously, these discussions are always done through our scheduling team, the COVID team to make sure we&#8217;re taking every step possible.&nbsp; But just like many Americans, he makes risk assessments.<br><br>And I would say, the last piece &#8212; what you didn&#8217;t ask about, but, you know, people ask about in here as well &#8212; is he has been traveling the country more, recently.&nbsp; You know, he was traveling three days last week.&nbsp; And we &#8212; in, of course, coordination with the President &#8212; made a decision that was vitally important to him, to his presidency, to the American people.<br><br>And certainly, that&#8217;s one of the reasons we want to be very clear that it is possible he could test positive for COVID.&nbsp; That, just like any American, even though he&#8217;s double boosted, that is possible.&nbsp; And, you know, we will, of course, be very transparent about that if that were to take place.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, do you have time for a few more questions?&nbsp; We&#8217;re told you have a hard out soon &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; I do.&nbsp; Go ahead.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; but didn&#8217;t know if you wanted to &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah, yeah.&nbsp; And then I&#8217;ll try to go the back.&nbsp;<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; Multiple outlets &#8212; CBS and Washington Post &#8212; have reported today that in yesterday&#8217;s meetings with &#8212; meeting with the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, that President Biden signaled that he was prepared to use executive authority to cancel student debt in the coming months.&nbsp; Can you confirm that this was something relayed to them by the President?&nbsp; And why?&nbsp; What exactly has the President considered doing when it comes to &#8212; to student aid debt?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; Well, let me use this opportunity to reiterate that nobody has paid a sing- &#8212; a penny in student loan &#8212; federal student loans since the President took office.&nbsp; And what we&#8217;ve said from here is that &#8212; and what he reiterated &#8212; is that he will make a decision before there&#8217;s an end to that pause.&nbsp;<br><br>Right now, it&#8217;s been extended through August.&nbsp; And we have talked about how we are looking at and he is looking at other executive authority options he has to bring relief to people who have student loans.&nbsp; So that&#8217;s what he conveyed during the meeting yesterday.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, regarding using executive action, though, I mean, is that something &#8212; a step now that the President is seriously looking at?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We&#8217;ve talked about that in the past, so he&#8217;s continuing to look at it.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then lastly, going back to Vice President Harris&#8217;s positive test for COVID, is the White House trying to determine exactly where and when she would have been exposed to COVID?&nbsp; Is it the assumption that it was during a trip to California last week?&nbsp; And is the White House and the Vice President&#8217;s Office doing any effort to contract [sic] trace in order to maybe notify people &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; during that lengthy trip who she might have ran into?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Just like for anyone who tests positive around here, we do contact tracing so that people are aware if they should take additional measures or precautions, whether it&#8217;s masking or getting additional PCR tests.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re certainly doing that in light of the Vice President&#8217;s positive test as well.&nbsp;<br><br>Go ahead.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; I wanted to ask if the White House had any reaction to that court case that put the temporary block on Title 42 being repealed.&nbsp;<br><br>And then I have a follow-up question about Vice President Harris.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure. &nbsp;Well, things sometimes happen when I&#8217;m out here.&nbsp; But when I &#8212; before I came out here, they had only done kind of the verbal briefing, as of last night.&nbsp; So I&#8217;m not sure if there&#8217;s &#8212; has there been a new development?&nbsp; Or that &#8212;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Shakes head “no”.)<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; So what I will tell you is the Department of Justice will need to review, kind of, any &#8212; any rulings before commenting.&nbsp; And that was verbal; there&#8217;ll be something more formal, is our expectation.&nbsp; And they would discuss any next legal steps or interpretation of the ruling.&nbsp; So we&#8217;ll leave that to them.&nbsp; And we&#8217;ll see if more comes out today.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, on Vice President Harris, do you know the last time she was tested prior to this morning?&nbsp; And is there any therapeutics that she&#8217;s taking?&nbsp; A doctor’s (inaudible) &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; So she&#8217;s on a regular testing protocol, just like the President.&nbsp; I can certainly check and see that information.&nbsp;<br><br>And then, as Dr. Jha referenced, she would consult with her doctor on any treatments.&nbsp;<br><br>Go ahead, Nadia.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; On foreign policy, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan is supposed to meet with his Israeli counterpart tomorrow.&nbsp; The Israelis have made it perfectly known that there is disagreement with the White House vis-à-vis Iran and going back to the negotiation.&nbsp; Can you update us?&nbsp; First of all, why he&#8217;s coming here?&nbsp; What’s on the agenda?&nbsp; And I have another question.&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; Well, they consult regularly.&nbsp; I would say, as you know, the President had a fruitful conversation with Israeli Prime Minister Bennett just a couple of days ago.&nbsp; And so, this is a follow-up to that conversation, and they&#8217;ll discuss a range of regional and global security issues.&nbsp;<br><br>And part of that &#8212; you know, the President, when he spoke with Prime Minister Bennett, they also talked about a range of global and regional issues, and Prime Minister Bennett extended an invitation for him to visit Israel, which he accepted and will do.&nbsp; We don&#8217;t have a date yet to announce.&nbsp;<br><br>They also talked about the Iran nuclear deal negotiations, which we &#8212; we keep the Israelis briefed regularly on.&nbsp; So, certainly that could be a part of this conversation as well.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, Secretary Blinken this morning testified at the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.&nbsp; He said the breakout time for Iran is weeks away.&nbsp; He blamed the previous administration from withdrawing from the deal.&nbsp; Does this worry the White House that we’re talking about two weeks that Iran could actually develop a nuclear weapon?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yes, it definitely worries us.&nbsp; I would say that if we go back, you know, under the &#8212; under the Iran nuclear deal, Iran&#8217;s nuclear program was tightly constrained and monitored by international inspectors.&nbsp; And since the Trump administration ceased U.S. participation in the deal, Iran has rapidly accelerated its nuclear program and reduced cooperation with international inspectors in non-performance of Iran nuclear deal commitments.&nbsp;<br><br>So, as you noted, what Secretary Blinken said during his testimony this morning was that their breakout period is down from about a year &#8212; which is what we knew it was during the deal &#8212; to just a few weeks or less.&nbsp; And certainly, that is a direct impact of pulling out of the nuclear deal, making us less safe, giving us less visibility.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s one of the reasons we pursued a diplomatic path, again, when the President took office.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Follow on that one?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Okay, April, last one.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then mine?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Okay, April last one.&nbsp; Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, Jen.&nbsp; Two questions &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; really fast.&nbsp; When it &#8212;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I thought you were going to the back.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When it comes &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Tomorrow is a new day.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come on.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Go ahead, April.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The back has never been called on.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hello, this is April.&nbsp; I’m sorry.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Inaudible) in the back.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, the two questions: On Haiti, what are the conversations?&nbsp; Can you shed light on the conversations about the Haitian immigration issue as Title 42 is set to end next month?<br><br>And also, as the Vice President has tested positive for COVID, and it is in the realm of possibility as the President is traveling &#8212; if he gets COVID, in this moment, what is the line of succession if both of them are very ill with COVID at this point?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, technically, the Speaker of the House is the third in line.&nbsp; So, there you go.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know, but I just want to make sure.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; No, I&#8217;m just confirming that for you.&nbsp; It is true, as we&#8217;ve noted many times, it is possible the President could test positive.&nbsp; We will be very transparent with you if that were to happen.&nbsp; He has access to the best healthcare in the &#8212; in the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>And we believe, because of all of the precautions and steps we have taken, that he would be able to continue his duties, as the Vice President is, as well, as Vice President.&nbsp; So I don&#8217;t have any prediction of that at this point in time.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>In terms of your first question on Haiti, tell me a little bit more about what you mean.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The way I understand: that there has been conversation or various conversations &#8212; to include at the U.N., here &#8212; about how do you handle the Haitian migrant issue when Haitian are being sent back, and then you&#8217;re bringing other refugees in.&nbsp; And I&#8217;m hearing that there are conversations around the administration about how to handle once Title 42 ends.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I would have to dig into this a little bit deeper.&nbsp; And as you know, there&#8217;s TPS &#8212; right? &#8212; that has been granted for a period of time.&nbsp; So that is something that Haitians who have been here at a certain &#8212; from a certain point in time have access to.&nbsp; Beyond that &#8212;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Inaudible) Title 42.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; &#8212; our focus, though, is, of course, on continuing to be the largest provider of aid and assistance to Haiti, ensuring we can take steps there to lead in the world, encouraging other countries in the world to take steps as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Beyond that, maybe we can talk after the briefing and I can find out a little bit more about what you mean.&nbsp; I will go to the back tomorrow first thing.&nbsp; Thank you so much, everyone.&nbsp;<br><br>3:57 P.M. EDT</p>
