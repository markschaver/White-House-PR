<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>New Initiatives Remove Barriers to Local Clean Energy, Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions</em></p>



<p>Since taking office, President Biden has prioritized expanding clean energy technologies as part of his historic efforts to tackle the climate crisis – all while helping American families lower their energy costs and creating good-paying, union jobs. Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) – like rooftop solar, battery storage, heat pumps, and electric vehicles – will cut consumer costs, improve public health, strengthen U.S. energy security, and help meet the President’s goal to reduce emission 50-52% below 2005 levels in 2030. Recent analysis shows that the average American family can save an additional $500 a year from using clean electricity like solar and heat pumps to power their homes. The President’s National Climate Task Force formed a Distributed Energy Resources Working Group to advance these clean energy technologies and ensure these cost-saving opportunities are available to all Americans.<br><br>Today, as part of the President’s commitment to tackling the climate crisis, the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing new partnerships and initiatives designed to increase access to these cost-saving local clean energy resources. These announcements leverage existing programs, funding, and guidance, including the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, to unlock resources and pave the way for good-paying jobs in the growing clean energy economy in communities across the country. Additionally, they build on those investments proposed in the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/briefing-room/2022/03/28/president-bidens-fy-2023-budget-reduces-energy-costs-combats-the-climate-crisis-and-advances-environmental-justice/?msclkid=fd01b572c0b411ec90840de7b0f43bef">President’s FY 2023 Budget</a>. These announcements will also further the President’s Justice40 Initiative which commits to delivering at least 40 percent of the benefits from federal climate and clean energy investments to disadvantaged communities that are marginalized, underserved, or overburdened by pollution.<br><br><strong>STREAMLING CLEAN ENERGY RESOURCES FOR AMERICANS</strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>Leveraging Community Financial Institutions to Lower Costs and Expand Clean Energy: </strong>Existing programs at the Department of Energy (DOE), Treasury and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) are collectively poised to support the investment of billions of dollars in state and local DER projects. These investments can be leveraged by institutions like community development financial institutions, credit unions, green banks, regional and community banks and state revolving funds to drive climate resilience and clean energy projects in underserved communities across the country. To accelerate these cost saving projects DOE, Treasury, and USDA will convene a community of practice to help community financial institutions understand how existing federal funding and technical assistance for clean energy investments can be leveraged for DER projects. To complement the work of the community of practice, the Distributed Energy Resources Working Group formed under the President’s National Climate Taskforce will compile a toolkit of DER financing resources, convene a community financial institutions summit focused on leveraging private and philanthropic capital for DER projects, and expand the work of the National Community Solar Partnership’s <a href="https://www.energy.gov/communitysolar/credit-ready-solar-initiative">Credit Ready Solar initiative</a> to include all DERs.<br></li><li><strong>Charting Strategic Deployment of DERs: </strong>DOE and <a href="https://appliedenergyscience.lbl.gov/">Lawrence Berkeley National Lab</a> (LBNL), as part of the <a href="https://www.rd.usda.gov/programs-services/rural-energy-america-program-renewable-energy-systems-energy-efficiency">National Community Solar Partnership</a> , are enhancing their REPAIR modeling tool to better understand how to maximize the benefits and cost savings of community solar and other DER projects to the local grid. DOE will use this tool and stakeholder engagement efforts to develop case studies and model technical, policy, and economic scenarios to inform stakeholders, like utilities, public service commissions, and DER developers on how to maximize the benefits of DER for communities.<br></li><li><strong>Enabling More Efficient Systems and Grid Infrastructure: </strong>DOE is announcing the establishment of new Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funded programs that will provide rebates for replacing old transformers and electric motor systems with newer ones that will be resilient to the impacts of extreme weather and increase energy efficiency. Replacing aging electric motor systems helps companies make pumps, fans, and compressors more efficient, providing significant energy and cost savings opportunities. Likewise, switching-out distribution transformers, which are some of the most vulnerable parts of America’s power grid, increases resilience and energy efficiency.</li></ul>



<p><strong>DELIVERING CLEAN ENERGY TO UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES</strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>Developing a Community Solar Customer Platform:&nbsp;</strong>The Department of Energy (DOE) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) <a href="https://energy.gov/communitysolar/liheap-community-solar-subscription-platform">will partner to develop and pilot a digital platform</a> that will manage the enrollment, use, and monitoring of community solar subscriptions for customers in the <a href="https://www.acf.hhs.gov/ocs/low-income-home-energy-assistance-program-liheap">Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program</a> (LIHEAP). The platform will connect customers who are LIHEAP-eligible with community solar subscriptions, to further reduce customer energy costs and remove barriers for application, while increasing the deployment of community solar projects and reducing the cost of customer acquisition. DOE’s <a href="https://www.rd.usda.gov/programs-services/rural-energy-america-program-renewable-energy-systems-energy-efficiency">National Community Solar Partnership</a> will lead coordination with HHS, utilities, state and local governments, and industry to develop the platform, with the goal of piloting the subscription program in 3-5 states.<br></li><li><strong>Ensuring Residents of HUD-Assisted Multifamily Housing Benefit from Solar Energy: </strong>Washington, D.C.’s “Solar for All” initiative aims to bring the benefits of solar energy to 100,000 families with low to moderate incomes in the District of Columbia. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has determined that D.C. Solar for All’s community-net-metering (CNM) credits will be excluded from household income and utility allowance calculations and therefore will not increase housing costs for residents in properties participating in HUD Multifamily rental assistance programs. HUD is also updating guidance to allow residents of affordable housing to better access cost-saving community solar subscriptions and reviewing guidance to allow Public Housing Authorities to more easily enter into power purchase agreements for low-cost clean energy.</li></ul>



<p><strong>BUILDING THE CLEAN ENERGY WORKFORCE OF THE FUTURE</strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>Creating Youth Climate Jobs: </strong>The Department of Labor’s (DOL) <a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/youth/youthbuild">Youthbuild</a> program will award 68 organizations more than $90 million to support the development of Registered Apprenticeship and other career pathway models that prepare underserved young adults (16-24 years) who are not currently in school for jobs in construction and other in-demand industries, including green building. This model will provide valuable training enabling the acquisition of occupational skills while promoting educational opportunities with youth &#8211; splitting time between workplace training and the classroom to obtain their high school diploma or equivalency degree.</li></ul>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Cabinet Room</p>



<p>4:28 P.M. EDT</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Secretary Austin, Deputy Secretary Hicks, and General Milley, my &#8212; and all our other outstanding military leaders around this Cabinet table: I&#8217;m honored to welcome you to the White House.&nbsp; And I really mean it &#8212; I’m honored to welcome you to the White House.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Above all, I want to thank each of you for your dedication to the service of this country and your members, families, and the longstanding service that you’ve all put in.</p>



<p>I also want to recognize the groundbreaking nature of this gathering.&nbsp; For the first time in the proud history of the Armed Forces, we not only have highly &#8212; highly quai- &#8212; hali- &#8212; a highly qualified woman as Vice President, but as Deputy Secretary of Defense and two women combatant commanders.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s an important milestone, I think, that speaks to how we&#8217;re harnessing the strength and diversity of our country in making sure women succeed in the military and throughout their careers.</p>



<p>As I said when I got elected &#8212; and I didn&#8217;t think people thought I meant it &#8212; but my administration is going to look like America.&nbsp; And I mean that sincerely.&nbsp; Not just in the military, but across the board.&nbsp; That’s where our strength comes from, in my view.</p>



<p>And today, I want to hear from all of you on your assessments on what you&#8217;re seeing in the field and across our forces.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And the strategic environment is evolving rapidly in the world, but that means our plans and force posture have to be equally dynamic.&nbsp; Things are changing.&nbsp; And, you know, ensuring that &#8212; the security of the American people, our interests, and the interests of our Allies means having to constantly adapt to anything and everything that’s happening around the world.</p>



<p>And we&#8217;re seeing this very day the need for adapt &#8212; adaptation as a consequence of our standing with Ukraine against Putin’s brutal and unjustified war.</p>



<p>And I want to applaud the exceptional work you&#8217;re doing to arm and equip brave Ukrainians that defend their nation.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know about you, but I&#8217;ve been to Ukraine a number of times before the war.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve spoken to the Rada.&nbsp; I was deeply involved in what was going on in Ukraine.&nbsp; And I knew they were tough and proud, but I tell you what: They&#8217;re tougher and more proud than I thought.&nbsp; I&#8217;m amazed what they&#8217;re doing with your help, in terms of providing advice and &#8212; and weaponry we&#8217;re providing, along with the rest of NATO.<br><br>Weapons and ammunition are flowing in daily.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re seeing just how vital our alliances and partnerships are around the world.&nbsp;<br><br>Our Allies are stepping up, amplifying the impact of our response.&nbsp; And NATO is united, focused, and energized as it’s ever been.&nbsp;<br><br>When I was a kid in the United States Senate in my 30s and in my 40s, I was chairman of the NATO subcommittee &#8212; the Foreign Relations Committee.&nbsp; I &#8212; not because of me or any particular thing, but I&#8217;ve never seen NATO as united.&nbsp; I know all the &#8212; I &#8212; I&#8217;m confident, in my view, just &#8212; this was Biden speaking &#8212; that I don&#8217;t think that Putin counted on being able to hold us together.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I&#8217;ve spoken well over 150 times to our NATO Allies, either &#8212; like, yesterday, there were four- &#8212; how many on &#8212;<br><br>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; Twelve of them.<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; How many?<br><br>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; Twelve.<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Twelve, yesterday for a couple hours.&nbsp; They &#8212; they are &#8212; they’re &#8212; they&#8217;re stepping up.&nbsp;<br><br>And the same is true of the Indo-Pacific, where our allies are the foundation for the future we want to see in that vital region of the world.&nbsp;<br><br>Your central, indispensable mission to deter aggression from all our enemies, if required, is &#8212; is on display, and to fight, to win wars remain critical to American power.<br><br>And as Commander-in-Chief, I &#8212; I rely on your advice and maintain our &#8212; to maintain our military edge and remain the ultimate guarantor of America&#8217;s security.<br><br>Quite frankly, even though I&#8217;ve been Vice President for 8 years and a senator for 36, I didn&#8217;t fully appreciate that &#8212; how the rest of the world literally looks to us as the leader of the free world.&nbsp; I mean, looks to us in very precise, specific ways.&nbsp; And something you all fully, fully understand.<br><br>And I rely, as I said, on your device &#8212; your advice and your ability to maintain our military edge.<br><br>And, you know, in return, I promise you &#8212; and I hope it&#8217;s been demonstrated since I&#8217;ve been President &#8212; that we as a nation will uphold the sacred duty we have and we owe you, our military men and women, to prepare, properly equip you before we send you into harm&#8217;s way.&nbsp; And when we do, to care for those and your family when you come home.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s why we&#8217;re doing so much at the &#8212; at the Veterans Affairs as well.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a &#8212; it&#8217;s a &#8212; it&#8217;s a sacred obligation.&nbsp;<br><br>And so, I want to thank you all again.&nbsp; I’m looking forward to our discussion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I thank the press for coming in.  Thank you.<br><br>4:34 P.M. EDT</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">James S. Brady Press Briefing Room</p>



<p>3:05 P.M. EDT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Hi, everyone.&nbsp; Hello.&nbsp; Okay, a couple of items for all of you at the top.</p>



<p>As you know, the President is headed to the West Coast tomorrow, and I wanted to give you a quick preview of his first trip to Oregon and Washington.&nbsp; He will highlight the historic economic growth and nearly 8 million jobs created as a result of his and congressional Democrats’ actions, including the American Rescue Plan and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and his work to lower costs.</p>



<p>He will visit Portland International Airport tomorrow to highlight critical investments to ensure stronger, more resilient infrastructure, such as an earthquake-resilient runway at the Portland Airport, and to help lower costs on everyday items by ensuring goods can move faster and more efficiently.</p>



<p>Governor Kate Brown, Senators Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley, and Congressman Kurt Schrader will join the President at the airport.</p>



<p>On Friday, he will mark Earth Day in Seattle, Washington, by speaking to the need to bolster our nation’s resilience in the face of threats like wildfire, and the need to rapidly deploy clean energy.&nbsp; He will be joined at the event by Governor Jay Inslee.</p>



<p>The President will also discuss how he is fighting to bring down prescription drug costs, such as insulin, where he will be joined by Governor Inslee, Senators Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell, and Congresswoman Kim Schrier.</p>



<p>The President will call on Congress to pass his plan to lower prescription drug prices and energy costs, but he’s not waiting for Congress to act.&nbsp; And he will highlight recent actions he’s taken to lower energy and healthcare costs, and give families more breathing room.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Those actions from just the last few weeks include: a historic release from the &#8212; from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, extending the use of E15 gasoline, taking 100 actions this year that would save families more than $100 annually on their utility bills, finalizing standards for cars and trucks that will allow drivers to travel further on every gallon of fuel, fixing the “family glitch” in the ACA, reducing the burden of medical debt, freezing student loan payments through August, and helping 3.6 million student loan borrowers move closer to debt forgiveness.</p>



<p>Also wanted to note on that front: Yesterday, you may have seen, as part of the administration’s historic commitment to support student loan borrowers and get borrowers the relief they are eligible for, the Department of Education announced changes that will move more than 3.6 million borrowers closer to student debt forgiveness; make 40,000 borrowers eligible for the immediate discharge of their loans under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program; provide immediate relief to thousands of borrowers in income-driven repayment plans.</p>



<p>We’re delivering this relief to borrowers by fixing longstanding failures in the income-driven repayment program &#8212; or “IDR,” as it’s often known.</p>



<p>Income-driven repayment is one of the best options borrowers who have &#8212; they have towards tackling their student loan debt.&nbsp; For too long, the system for tracking payments has been broken.&nbsp; And there were significant flaws that suggested borrowers who were entitled to forgiveness were missing out on their &#8212; on their progress toward debt forgiveness.</p>



<p>So, these steps include making sure that any months in which borrowers made payments will count toward IDR forgiveness, regardless of the repayment plan, and any borrower who has made the required number of payments for IDR forgiveness based on this payment-count revision will receive loan cancellation automatically.</p>



<p>Additionally, we know that in past &#8212; in the past, loan servicers placed borrowers who were struggling to manage repayment into forbearances without giving them adequate information about alternatives.</p>



<p>And that meant, in forbearance, while no payments were due, interest continued to accrue and borrowers did not get credit toward IDR forgiveness.&nbsp; This was often not the best option for borrowers, particularly when they would be eligible for an economic hardship deferment or a low or zero payment on an IDR plan.</p>



<p>And to make sure that existing borrowers aren’t permanently harmed by these failures, the Department will apply PSLF and IDR credit for borrowers who ended up in long-term forbearance.&nbsp; Those are forbearances of 12 or more consecutive months, or 36 or more total months.</p>



<p>So, important steps on that front.</p>



<p>The last thing I just wanted to note &#8212; and you may have seen this &#8212; but this morning, the Department of Treasury sanctioned Trans- &#8212; Transcapitalbank, a key Russian commercial bank that has offered services to banks globally to evade international sanctions, and more than 40 individuals and entities that are part of a Russian sanctions evasion network led by Russian oligarch Konstantin Malofeyev.</p>



<p>We have also imposed sanctions on companies in Russia’s virtual currency mining industry that operate vast server farms and provide revenue to the Russian government.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And the Department of State imposed visa restrictions on more than 600 individuals in response to human rights abuses by Russia and Belarus.</p>



<p>So, this is part of our stepped-up effort to crack down on those attempting to evade our unprecedented sanctions.</p>



<p>With that, Darlene, why don’t you kick us off.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; A couple of questions on masking.&nbsp; The President said yesterday that people should decide for themselves whether to wear masks on airplanes.&nbsp; And I’m wondering whether his comment was intended to signal a shift in thinking in the administration away from mandates toward more personal responsibility.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, the question &#8212; the President was answering the question quite literally, which means, right now, as you know, we are not implementing the mask mandate because of the court order, which we disagree with, while he is still abiding by CDC guidance.&nbsp; And we recommend Americans do that across the country.&nbsp; They’re still recommending people wear masks on airplanes; on Air Force One &#8212; which, of course, is a federal, not a private, plane.&nbsp; We all wore masks on the plane when we traveled to New Hampshire yesterday.</p>



<p>But we are not le- &#8212; people are not legally bound to wear masks.&nbsp; So, it is a point in time where it is up to people &#8212; it is their choice, in that regard.</p>



<p>Q    And then, one other question, actually, on a different topic, in the interest of time here today.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are you able to confirm reports that the President is replacing the Acting ATF Director with another gentleman who will also be the Acting ATF Director until the person he nominated last week is confirmed by the Senate?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; So, I know there have been reports about this out there.&nbsp; And I will say that the President is making the designation under the Vacancies Reform Act, which, of course, says that any President, and only the President, may direct a person who serves in an office for which appointment is required to be made by the President, by and with the advice and consent of Senate, to perform the functions and duties of the vacant office temporarily.</p>



<p>We, of course, are strongly advocating for and pushing for his eminently qualified nominee to be confirmed and have an ATF confirmed Director for the first time in many years, which is something we would be eager to see happen.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; On the long-range missile test today, Putin says this is meant to provide “food for thought” for those who threaten Russia.&nbsp; Can you talk us through how the administration is interpreting this and whether you’re viewing this as a warning or a threat in any way?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We are not &#8212; they were &#8212; they notified under the START Treaty, and so, from our perspective, while we &#8212; they provided advance notice of this launch under its New START Treaty obligations that have planned to test this missile, the Defense Department said today that we did not deem the test a threat to the United States or its allies, and the timing of the scope of Russia&#8217;s missile tests do not influence our approach to countering Russia&#8217;s further invasion of Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, it was noticed through the proper process and the Department of Defense has spoken to this as well.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And on an unexpected announcement of another round of assistance to Ukraine, could you walk us through any specifics, if you have any, on that and when that&#8217;s happening?&nbsp;</p>



<p>And just big picture on this: The U.S. has already given more than $2.5 billion since this war started.&nbsp; How long can the U.S. expect to continue to bankroll so much of this war?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, okay, there&#8217;s a couple questions there, so let me do my best in answering them.</p>



<p>First, we are working, of course, around the clock, as you know, to provide security assistance to Ukraine.&nbsp; And just to give you an example of how that assistance has flowed, just in the last few days &#8212; and I think I gave an update the other day &#8212; but five flights with military assistance have arrived in the region over the last few days.&nbsp; More than half a dozen flights from the United States are scheduled to land in the region shortly with additional equipment.</p>



<p>And as we look at providing this assistance, which I know &#8212; I&#8217;ll go back to the first part of your question, of course &#8212; but what we&#8217;ve tried to do &#8212; we made a strategic decision given we&#8217;ve seen Russia reposition their troops and their military to the eastern part of Ukraine to fight a different kind of war on the ground, which will be more, you know, kind of shooting back and forth through long range.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so, we have been working with Ukrainians and the Ukrainian military to determine exactly the kind of security assistance they need for this stage in the war.&nbsp; And that has included an increase, as you&#8217;ve seen, in artillery and ammunition and weapons, like Howitzers and others, that can do these sorts of &#8212; they can &#8212; are effective in this long-range shooting and long-range fighting that we are seeing or we anticipate will happen in this stage of the war.</p>



<p>So, we have been expediting this assistance to the ground over the last couple of weeks to ensure they are prepared as this &#8212; as this portion of the war is starting &#8212; not because they are using all of it in in seven days, but because we want them to have all of this equipment as quickly as possible as they prepare to fight this war on the ground.</p>



<p>In terms of assistance and what we will be &#8212; what we&#8217;re preparing or the reports that I know have been out there, I will say I expect we&#8217;ll have more soon on this, but I have nothing to preview at this point in time.</p>



<p>I would note that out of the $3.5 billion in drawdown authority Congress granted for this fiscal year, we&#8217;ve used over $2.4 billion so far to provide Ukraine the military equipment and capabilities they need to defend themselves.</p>



<p>So, obviously, there&#8217;s more of that approved drawdown assistance that we can provide.&nbsp; And we&#8217;ve been working to expedite and ensure, as I noted, that it&#8217;s meeting exactly the needs they have at this point in the war.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had a couple quick ones on masks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The DOJ said yesterday that they would decide, essentially, whether or not to appeal that ruling based on what the CDC says they need or don&#8217;t need.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the White House or the Cabinet involved in any way in that decision-making process?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, we are entirely able to and legally able to be a part of the discussion, but right now it&#8217;s &#8212; we, of course, are deferring to the CDC on what they believe is needed at this moment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They have already &#8212; they obviously put in place this two-week extension because they felt they needed that to take a look at the data, given that we&#8217;ve seen a rise in cases.&nbsp; So, we certainly anticipate to hear more from them soon on their ask for being able to have that time, which we think is entirely warranted.</p>



<p>And the Department of Justice, as you noted, has indicated that they would appeal not just because they think it&#8217;s entirely reasonable, of course, to have this additional time to look at it, but because they think that the current &#8212; for current and future public health crises, we want to preserve that authority for the CDC to have in the future.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then just &#8212; when you said a moment ago that it literally is a personal choice as to whether people are &#8212; decide to put a mask on or not on planes, is &#8212; does that messaging still reflect a shift for you all &#8212; and, maybe to some degree, a capitulation &#8212; to just the mood of the public about wanting to be over this pandemic or people who have politicized the wearing of masks in the first place?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, first, I would say we continue to recommend everyone wear masks on planes.</p>



<p>What the President was speaking to is, of course, because we are not currently implementing the mask mandate, it is not a requirement.&nbsp; So, people can choose, even as we recommend it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But to be clear: We are recommending everyone wear masks on planes.&nbsp; That is what the CDC is recommending.&nbsp; That is the public health guidance we are following.</p>



<p>I would note &#8212; I know this is often said and maybe some of it is because there was the video of people on planes &#8212; on the plane &#8212; on one plane taking off their masks: Public polling does not actually show that there is a universal view of people getting rid of masks.&nbsp; That&#8217;s not actually what public polling shows.</p>



<p>Now, it doesn&#8217;t matter to us because we are making our decisions based on public health and data and what the CDC is recommending.&nbsp; But that is not the universal view of the public.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, a Ukrainian commander in Mariupol is saying that his forces and civilians in the area may only have hours to make it out alive, and he has been making this direct plea to the President for the U.S. to somehow be involved in extracting people from the area.&nbsp; Do you know if that&#8217;s a request that the President himself is aware of?&nbsp; And can you just walk us through &#8212; can the U.S. be directly involved at this point in making that happen or helping to make that happen?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; We have certainly seen these &#8212; these cries for help and these asks for help.&nbsp; What &#8212; we certainly urge the Russian government to do the right thing: guarantee safe passage for any civilians or others who wish to leave the city.&nbsp; We also encourage them to allow deliveries of humanitarian aid, such as food and medicine and safe passage for volunteers to help people in need. &nbsp;But I don&#8217;t have any additional updates from here.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And quickly, on the President and whether he might visit Ukraine, you&#8217;ve obviously said a couple of times: Currently, there are no plans to do that.&nbsp; Yesterday, when he was asked “Are you going?,” he said he wasn&#8217;t sure.&nbsp; Is a trip completely off the table for now for him?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Nothing has changed in our assessment.&nbsp; I would also note, as I&#8217;ve said in here before, if anyone were to visit Ukraine from the United States, it&#8217;s not something we would announce in advance, confirm in advance, give details on who, if, and when because of security reasons.</p>



<p>And that&#8217;s something I think anyone who&#8217;s traveled to a war zone with a President or a Vice President or anyone is quite familiar with that policy.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So when he said he didn&#8217;t know, was he trying to indicate that it could be on the table?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Nothing has changed in our plans.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have one more &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&#8212; one more question.&nbsp; There, obviously, are so many horrific images coming out of Ukraine.&nbsp; They are very readily available photographs, videos of civilian deaths.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we enter the third month of this conflict, can you walk us through &#8212; give us a sense of how the President himself has been sort of processing these images?&nbsp; Who does he talk to?&nbsp; What does he lean on as he processes images that, you know, coming from what he himself has called a genocide?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah, look, I will say that the President is processing these images, as many Americans are &#8212; with horror; with sadness; with, you know, fear for the people of Ukraine &#8212; for the families, for the children, for innocent civilians who are at risk.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is &#8212; obviously, this conflict is consuming a great deal of his time, as much as he is working on a range of other priorities here, but he is consuming them as many people are &#8212; as I am, as many of you are, as Americans out there watching all of your networks are.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s emotional.&nbsp; It is &#8212; you know, watching some of these images is very raw for people, including the President, because you&#8217;re seeing people suffering at the hands of a dictator who is brutally targeting civilians.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few on Ukraine for you.&nbsp; Does the fact that the U.S. is committing heavier weapons systems than it did initially indicate that there&#8217;s less &#8212; at least in the assessment of the United States, less risk of retaliation from Russia now?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; The types of weapons systems we&#8217;re providing, Ed, are really a reflection of the conversations happening with the Ukrainian leadership and military about what they need in this stage of the war.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And because this stage of the war is different &#8212; because it&#8217;s going to be more on the ground and more &#8212; more, kind of, back-and-forth, long-range fighting &#8212; there&#8217;s different kinds of weapons and system they need: more artillery, more ammunition.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a different &#8212; different war than it was when they were, you know, in the western part of the country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You had said earlier that you &#8212; that the government is continuing to monitor that whatever is sent over is meeting the needs of the war.&nbsp; How exactly is that monitoring happening?&nbsp; (Inaudible), there are going to be a lot of questions about how was the money spent, who did the equipment get in the hands of, how was it used.&nbsp; It may not be the next few weeks &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; but this could be over the next several months or years of “Was this worth it?&nbsp; Was it worth the cost?”</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How is that being done now?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, look, I think that if you ask most Americans, if you ask members of Congress, if you ask most people in this country, what we &#8212; what&#8217;s important to do now is to equip and provide the type of support, assistance, including military equipment, to help them continue to fight &#8212; and win, in some cases, as they did in the Battle of Kyiv &#8212; this war.</p>



<p>That is our focus.&nbsp; Obviously, we coordinate very closely with them, but we provide them the assistance to distribute amongst their military.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because there was support in the beginning of the Iraq War, in the Afghanistan War, and then there were years spent trying to retrace the spending and all that.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not saying that necessarily is going to be the case in this one, but there&#8217;s &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; And &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; no mechanism in place right now at least to track &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I would point you to the Department of Defense to detail that further.&nbsp; But I would note: Obviously, this is different, given we don&#8217;t have U.S. soldiers on the ground.</p>



<p>Obviously, equipment, ensuring we&#8217;re reducing waste, fraud, and abuse is important to the President, but it&#8217;s a different kind of war for a range of reasons.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Given that Russia has conducted an ICBM test, is there any plan to reschedule the one that we cancelled back on April 1st?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; That&#8217;s not something we would preview.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; And what&#8217;s the latest on the reported chemical weapons attack in Mariupol?&nbsp; Did the Russians use chemical weapons?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; There&#8217;s no new assessment from here.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do we have any sense of when or how much longer that would take?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t.&nbsp; I mean, what we talked about at the time &#8212; and I know my colleagues at the Department of Defense and State also referenced &#8212; is we don&#8217;t have a team on the ground.&nbsp; It is difficult to assess.&nbsp; So, it is something certainly we continue to work to do, but we don&#8217;t have any additional updates or confirmation.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; I have a question about marijuana policy.&nbsp; President Biden, as a candidate, promised to decriminalize marijuana.&nbsp; When is that going to happen?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, the President continues to believe that no one should be in jail because of drug use.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have an update here.&nbsp; We are continuing to work with Congress.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But what I can say on marijuana is we&#8217;ve made some progress on our promises.&nbsp; For instance, the DEA just issued its first licenses to companies to cultivate marijuana for research purposes after years of delay during the prior administration. This is a key step in promoting research because it broadens the amount and quality of cannabis available for research purposes.</p>



<p>Additionally, the President is continuing to view his cleme- &#8212; review his clemency powers, which is something he also talked about on the campaign, and he certainly remains committed to taking action on.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So he remains committed to what he said during the campaign, that people charged with marijuana-related offenses &#8212; number one, everybody gets out, record expunged?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, again, he&#8217;s reviewing his clemency powers.&nbsp; That&#8217;s exactly what that looks like.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have any updates or previews beyond that, though.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; And a question about immigration.&nbsp; Does the President still have confidence that the Vice President can get to the bottom of root causes of migration?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; He absolutely does and is grateful for her work in doing exactly that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Why does he have confidence?&nbsp; Or &#8212; should I &#8212; should I give you an update on a couple of the things we&#8217;ve done?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well &#8212; so, does the President &#8212; what gives the President confidence when he sees that March 2022 has 28 percent more migrant encounters at the border than March 2021, when she got this assignment?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, you asked me about root causes &#8212; right? &#8212; so let me address that first and what the Vice President and other members of the administration who have been working with her have been doing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So we&#8217;ve been working with source and transit coun- &#8212; countries in the region to facilitate the quick return of individuals who previously resided in those countries, as well as to stem migration in its state.&nbsp; Some of that is getting agreements with partner countries on migration-related matters, and that&#8217;s something that the Vice President has been deeply engaged with.</p>



<p>I&#8217;d also note that Secretary Mayorkas &#8212; who, of course, has worked with her on this &#8212; traveled to Costa Rica recently, where he joined the President of Costa Rica in announcing a bilateral migration agreement outlining our shared commitment to both manage migrant flows, as well as to promote &#8212; promote economic growth in the region.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And we also are maintaining a close partnership between the government of Mexico and the United States to stem irregular migration.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, there are &#8212; what “addressing root causes” means is working with countries in the region to take steps to have partnership, be able to have people sent back to the region as needed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then the last one on this: Is the President or are you guys having discussions with advisors about delaying the removal of Title 42?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would again remind everyone &#8212; because you gave me the opportunity, so thank you &#8212; Title 42 is not an immigration authority.&nbsp; I will &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it going to be &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; &#8212; I will get to your &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; around past the end of May?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I will &#8212; I will get to your question.&nbsp; I promise, Peter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is a public health authority.&nbsp; Congress gave the CDC authority to make determinations about when it should be lifted.&nbsp; So, right now, we are planning and preparing for the end of Title 42 enforcement on May 23rd.&nbsp; But I would say that there are a range &#8212; the President agrees that immigration in our country is broken; it&#8217;s a system that is broken.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are a range of ideas out there in Congress &#8212; Democrats, Republicans, others &#8212; some who support a delay of Title 42 implementation, some who strongly oppose it.&nbsp; And there are a range of other ideas of reforming our immigration system.</p>



<p>This would all require congressional action.&nbsp; We&#8217;re happy to have that conversation with them.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Along the Title 42 &#8212; excuse me, sorry, it&#8217;s allergies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; It&#8217;s okay.&nbsp; We understand.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#8217;m good.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We understand.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We&#8217;ve been reporting that the administration is projecting a big budget shortfall for ICE and CBP should Title 42 be lifted.&nbsp; Is there a plan for how to get additional funding that&#8217;s going to be needed to handle immigrants coming into the country?&nbsp; If that &#8212; Title 42 is lifted, will you need funds from Congress?&nbsp; Can you divert funds from somewhere else?&nbsp; What&#8217;s the thinking?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; So what DHS said last month is that they expect the current funding levels will not be sufficient to meet operational needs, but they have a number of options available to secure the resources required to implement our comprehensive strategy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This includes reprioritizing and reallocating existing funds; re- &#8212; requesting additional support from other federal agencies; if necessary, engaging with Congress on that discussion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I would note that, as a part of this &#8212; you know, as we prepare for the implementation as &#8212; of the end of Title 42, there are a range of steps that we&#8217;ve been taking to prepare for that, including surging resources; deploying resour- &#8212; resources to address increased volumes.&nbsp; That includes moving officers, agents, DHS volunteer force personnel to rapidly decompress points along the border and more efficiently process migrants.</p>



<p>It also entails the deployment of COVID-19 mitigation efforts, including the use of continued &#8212; use of PPE, providing the COVID-19 vaccines.&nbsp; It also includes expanding these efforts to cover migrants in CBP custody.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, the point is there are a range of steps in this comprehensive plan that &#8212; I know Secretary Mayorkas is testifying today on the Hill, and I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;ll be testifying more in the future.&nbsp; But what they said at the time when we announced this was that we expect current funding levels would not be sufficient.&nbsp; There are a range of ways to address that, and we&#8217;re working on exactly that.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And if &#8212; because we&#8217;re just about a month away from this being lifted &#8212; if the administration doesn&#8217;t feel like that plan is in place yet, would that be a reason to delay lifting Title 42?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, we proposed a plan.&nbsp; So that&#8217;s a plan that is being implemented.&nbsp; In terms of any ideas to address immigration, including any delay of Title 42, that would require congressional action.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So &#8212; go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More than 3,000 Ukrainians were processed along the southern border &#8212; people who had flown to Mexico to try to get into the U.S.&nbsp; That&#8217;s a big leap over February.&nbsp; That number is expected to increase.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Does the administration have any plans to announce a program that would make it easier for Ukrainians who already have family ties in the U.S. to be expedited into the U.S.?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We are &#8212; we are working &#8212; so, we&#8217;ve obviously announced &#8212; the President has announced plans to accept 100,000 Ukrainians into the United States &#8212; if they want to come, of course.&nbsp; We are working to finalize the details of that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course, right now, we are still &#8212; as you all know; as we&#8217;ve been talking about &#8212; implementing Title 42, no matter what country you&#8217;re coming from, whether it&#8217;s Ukraine or any other country in the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; But nothing &#8212; is there anything immediately in the works for a plan &#8212; a program similar to that to (inaudible).</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, no, the President announced, a few weeks ago, plans to welcome 100,000 Ukrainian &#8212; Ukrainians, right?&nbsp; So it&#8217;s just the details of how that program will work.&nbsp; I understand why you&#8217;re asking; we just don&#8217;t have the final details yet.&nbsp; But &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; And then, on supply chains, millions of people in China are on lockdown.&nbsp; Experts are sounding the alarm for what that could mean for further crippling supply chains, which already are &#8212; obviously are already under strain.&nbsp; Is the administration concerned?&nbsp; How concerned is the administration about what that could mean for Americans waiting for goods here in the U.S.?&nbsp; Is there anything that the U.S. can do to mitigate that?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; So this is a very fluid &#8212; and I think you&#8217;re talking about the lockdown around Shanghai &#8212; right? &#8212; and the impact.&nbsp; So it&#8217;s a very fluid situation, obviously.&nbsp; There&#8217;s some uncertainty surrounding the impacts of China&#8217;s lockdown on our economy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We are in close contact with key actors in the supply chain, including the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach.&nbsp; We&#8217;re not seeing currently, according to the Port of LA, any slowdown in ships coming from Asia, but we&#8217;re going to continue to keep our eye on that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What we&#8217;ve seen happen within China is moving of the manufacturing of some of the goods &#8212; semiconductors, consumer electronics, et cetera &#8212; that are coming &#8212; typically come from Shanghai to other hubs, moving them around to see if they can keep the manufacturing up.&nbsp; And they&#8217;ve also moved ports and where &#8212; moved around where the &#8212; where the goods are going from in ports there, which may be why we haven&#8217;t seen a reduction in goods coming from Asia.</p>



<p>The last data, in terms of Chinese exports, we have is from March, because it&#8217;s not yet the end of April, and that showed a 15 percent increase from last year.&nbsp; But we&#8217;ll have to look at the April data when it comes out in May.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I might be being a little thick, but I still don&#8217;t quite understand what the administration&#8217;s position on the &#8212; how you’re, kind of, approaching the mask issue is.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, the Justice Department said that they would appeal the decision if the CDC wanted them to.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The CDC has said that they wanted masks, they still think masking is important, and that they had that policy in place.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, I don&#8217;t understand why the Justice Department is not immediately appealing it and especially seeking an emergency stay to potentially keep this in place while the CDC continues its sort of broader evaluation.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; Well, I&#8217;m &#8212; I don&#8217;t even play a lawyer on TV, so I won&#8217;t get too much into legal strategy.&nbsp; But what I will tell you is the CDC obviously, as you noted, called for this extension because they wanted to look at more data.&nbsp; So I think we can all expect they&#8217;re going to continue to want it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Department of Justice is just waiting for that kind of final comment to &#8212; to take action in appealing. &nbsp;They said they would appeal.&nbsp; In terms of when they will appeal, I&#8217;ll leave that to them to speak to.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Why not a stay or an emergency appeal?&nbsp; They can speak to that.&nbsp; But what I would note &#8212; the objective here is, of course, to appeal the 15-day extension but also to preserve the CDC authority over the long term.&nbsp; Because as we&#8217;ve noted from here, we expect there to be ups and downs in the pandemic, and we certainly want the CDC to continue to have this authority.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So &#8212; in, I guess, plain English: If the CDC determines at the end of that 15-day review period that they already had undergoing that they wouldn&#8217;t continue the mask mandate, then the Justice Department will not pursue this appeal?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I would expect you&#8217;ll hear from the CDC very soon.&nbsp; And I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s at the end of 15 days, in terms of their expectation and ask for an appeal.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Title 42, you kind of floated congressional action out there and (inaudible) because Title 42, I think, was like a key part of the &#8212; in scuttling the negotiations over COVID money.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so what I&#8217;m trying to, I think &#8212; the question I&#8217;m curious in is if you&#8217;re signaling that sort of willingness by the administration to negotiate over the lifting of Title 42 as part of trying to get that COVID package across line.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And &#8212; and if not, or if so, do you have any sort of update on the strategy there?&nbsp; Because you &#8212; you were certainly banging the drums about how important it was before Congress went away, and they&#8217;re coming back soon.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We&#8217;re still banging the drums about the COVID money, I promise you.&nbsp; I was just making clear, because I think there&#8217;s been some confusion about this, that while the CDC had the &#8212; has the authority &#8212; right? &#8212; to determine when the &#8212; the &#8212; when &#8212; when the conditions exist to lift Title 42, that was given to them by Congress.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If Congress were to want to extend that, they need to take action.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not a &#8212; it&#8217;s not an executive authority from the White House.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, the President would be open to legislation that provided COVID funding but also extended &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We&#8217;re not in any way there, so I wasn&#8217;t going there.&nbsp; I was just conveying that, as you know, there are strong views on a range of immigration issues and proposals in Congress, right?&nbsp; I&#8217;m not telling you something you don&#8217;t know.</p>



<p>There are some people who would like to see it extended; there are some people who definitely would not.&nbsp; And so, I&#8217;m not making a prediction of the future, only conveying to what authority would be required &#8212; what &#8212; what the process would require.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Would the White House support the bill that Senator Sinema is &#8212; is bringing forth, which is working to extend Title 42 until there&#8217;s a plan in place &#8212; to, sort of, end the public health emergency?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have any prediction of that.&nbsp; The President has proposed, put forward, called for immigration reform &#8212; something he did on his first day in office.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re happy to have a range of conversations with members about a range of ideas.&nbsp; But I just wanted to note what authority would be required or what &#8212; how the process would work.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two things.&nbsp; South Korean media is reporting that President Biden will visit the country next month, May 20th through the 22nd.&nbsp; Can you confirm that?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don’t have anything to confirm yet on the trip beyond what the President himself has already confirmed.&nbsp; But we will have more to say soon, I&#8217;m sure.&nbsp; (Laughter.)</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All right.&nbsp; And on COVID aid, I&#8217;m wondering if the administration has sort of a drop-dead date by which Congress has to give them the additional funding?&nbsp; I know you&#8217;ve talked about it.&nbsp; The supply of monoclonal antibodies will run out in May &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; and the test capacity will ramp down by the end of June.&nbsp; So, is June your deadline or is it much earlier?&nbsp; Or is it later if you can repurpose some of the existing money?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I would say it&#8217;s as soon as possible because we have already had to take steps &#8212; right? &#8212; like ending our program for the uninsured.&nbsp; We haven&#8217;t been able to make purchases that we would normally purchase to get ahead.</p>



<p>I mean, even on monoclonal antibodies or some of these treatments, some of them take months to make, so it already puts us behind where we need to be and want to be in planning.&nbsp; So, we don&#8217;t have a long-term deadline, nor would I punt that out.&nbsp; We want to do it as quickly as possible when they return.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; Several senators, Democrats and Republican, have called on the President to appoint a coordinator or a czar, if you will, to oversee the transfer of military equipment from the U.S. to Ukraine.&nbsp; What does the administration think of this idea?&nbsp; Do you think it’s needed and is it something that’s even being considered?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have any personnel updates.&nbsp; Obviously, ensuring that it is &#8212; and this kind of goes back to Ed&#8217;s earlier question &#8212; that it is done effectively, efficiently, quickly is &#8212; is our &#8212; is a priority for the President.&nbsp; But I don&#8217;t have any &#8212; any personnel previews or updates at this point in time.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, two questions.&nbsp; I wanted to ask you about the concept of athletic boycotts to deal with Russia and if this is something that the administration supports.&nbsp; I’m sure you saw some of the news that Wimbledon decided to ban athletes from Russia and Belarus from competing in the tournament, and I’m just curious if the administration believes the athletic boycotts are a good tactic to use.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, we’ve seen 600, if not more, companies &#8211;private-sector companies &#8212; pull out voluntarily, I think, their investments in Russia.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t &#8212; I don&#8217;t think we have a policy specifically on athletic events at this point in time.&nbsp; I&#8217;m happy to check.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, also, there were reports that Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and some other U.S. officials walked out of G20 rooms when Russian officials began speaking.&nbsp; Could you just explain a little bit more about why they took that move?&nbsp; And is it a move that we could anticipate President Biden making himself?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, the President and Secretary Yellen have both said that we can&#8217;t have business as usual at the G20 or in a lot of these international forums as it relates to Russia.</p>



<p>And she and the Treasury team made clear that she was planning to participate in some and not other meetings, which is certainly something we support.</p>



<p>The President also has conveyed he doesn’t believe that they should be a part &#8212; that Russia should be a part of the G20.&nbsp; That&#8217;s now six months away, in terms of his participation, so I can’t make a prediction of what actions he may or may not take.&nbsp; But certainly, we support her steps, and it&#8217;s an indication of the fact that President Putin and Russia has become a pariah on the global stage.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.&nbsp; Just today, Russia issued another warning about consequences of Finland and Sweden joining NATO. Do have a response?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, the decision of any country to join NATO is up to that country and NATO to make a determination about.&nbsp; And certainly, that&#8217;s the case here.&nbsp; We strongly support NATO&#8217;s open-door policy, and I&#8217;m not going to indulge Russia&#8217;s saber-rattling.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.&nbsp; Just to zoom out a little on the Ukraine &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; aid and the policy talks about this war.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The president of the European Council, Charles Michel, was there today in Kyiv.&nbsp; And he said, quote &#8212; it was unusually clear, I thought.&nbsp; He said, “You are not alone.&nbsp; We are with you and will do everything which is possible to support you and to make sure that Ukraine will win the war.”&nbsp; Is it the policy of the United States that Russia should not only lose but be seen to lose this war?&nbsp; Is that a strategic goal?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I think we&#8217;ve been pretty clear that we&#8217;re going to do everything possible to make sure President Putin and Russia recognize this is a strategic loss, that the President is a pariah on the global stage.</p>



<p>Now, when you have a country that has lost as many people as Ukraine has &#8212; millions of people have been left homeless &#8212; you know, I don&#8217;t know if that feels like a win to them.</p>



<p>But I think it&#8217;s also true that the Ukrainians have clearly won the Battle of Kyiv.&nbsp; They have surpassed the expectations of the world in terms of their ability to fight back against Russia.&nbsp; And Russia has not only become a pariah on the world stage, but they have effectively united NATO, effectively driven countries to desire an interest in joining NATO, have united the West in a way that has never been their objective, while also their economy is crumbling.</p>



<p>So, you know, that is all a victory in terms of &#8212; in terms of isolating Russia.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; But is the concrete goal of the aid that is going there &#8212; now it&#8217;s artillery and more &#8212; is the goal a battlefield defeat for Russia, ultimately?&nbsp; Not a compromise, not &#8212; not, you know &#8212; no gray areas, just &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We&#8217;re doing everything we can to equip the Ukrainian government, Ukrainian leaders to effectively fight back in this military battle.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; Just to go back to the mask ruling.&nbsp; You mentioned some of the videos that we saw, but it certainly did prompt some very abrupt changes on Monday after it came down &#8212; passengers being told mid-flight to take their masks off.&nbsp; Can you share more about what the President&#8217;s personal reaction was to the decision, to how it came down, and what unfolded over this couple of hours and the stories we&#8217;re hearing about some of those flights?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I&#8217;m not sure we have a story here about some of those flights.&nbsp; I &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No, no &#8212; the story that &#8212; I mean, you know, we&#8217;re hearing now about parents talking about being on a flight with their kids and them being concerned because they were mid-flight.&nbsp; But just &#8212; what was his reaction to the decision and what happened then over the next couple of hours on Monday?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, we obviously didn&#8217;t expect the decision because we wouldn&#8217;t have known in advance how a court would act.&nbsp; So &#8212; and we disagreed with the decision immediately.&nbsp; So the immediate steps were to determine what power we had to respond to that.&nbsp; Obviously, that &#8212; that came in the form of the Department of Justice, came in the form of the CDC acting and putting out the statements that they did.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But, you know, we also don&#8217;t take photos of flights as data about how the country reacts to issues &#8212; you know, whether they&#8217;re ripping off their masks or not.&nbsp; I mean, our focus here was seeing what power we had to preserve what we felt was in the public health interests of the country.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And are the President&#8217;s COVID advisors concerned that there could be an increase in cases, a spike in cases in the coming weeks because, specifically, of the mask mandate being lifted?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I&#8217;m not going to make a projection of that because I&#8217;m not a doctor.&nbsp; And certainly, I can check with our health team and see if they have any predictions of that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Obviously, they wanted more time because they&#8217;ve seen rising cases and they feel it is in our interest to preserve the mask mandate, even for that short period of time &#8212; or have the authority moving forward in case cases go up and we needed to take that step in the future.</p>



<p>But I don&#8217;t have a prediction of rising cases.&nbsp; I would point you to the CDC or other health officials.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, there are reports in Mexico media stating the Mexican government has decided to dismantle a binational police group that was fighting Mexican cartels and drug cartel operations down there.&nbsp; I wonder if the administration is aware of that, and if you have any reaction to that decision.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I&#8217;m happy to check with our NSC team and see if they have any specific reaction.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Go ahead.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; First of all, on Israel, does the administration have a reaction to the recent deadly clashes in Israel with Palestinians?&nbsp; Does it change your stance on the Abraham Accord?&nbsp; Do you have a different view now on how to achieve peace in that region?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We are &#8212; while we are deeply concerned by the recent violence in Jerusalem at the Temple Mount &#8212; on the Temple Mount and across the West Bank, we also strongly condemn the recent rocket attack on Israel.&nbsp; We continue to call on all sides to exercise restraint, avoid provocative actions and rhetoric, and preserve the historic status quo of the Haram al-Sharif Temple Mount.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We also continue to urge Israeli and Palestinian officials to work cooperatively to lower tensions and ensure the safety of everyone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And we, of course, continue to closely follow the situation on the ground and stay in touch through diplomatic channels.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any change in stance on the Abraham Accord?&nbsp; Or &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; There is no change in our &#8212; on our stance.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Cuba &#8212; as you know, administration officials are meeting with Cuba to &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; discuss maybe including them in a migration policy.&nbsp; What might that look like in the future?&nbsp; And is that a possibility?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would say that we see these talks as pretty standard.&nbsp; The migration talks provide an opportunity for discussions on migration issues between Cubi [sic] and the &#8212; Cuba and the United States.&nbsp; And they&#8217;re part of regular order meetings continuing over nearly 30 years of engagement on Cuba on &#8212; with Cuba on migration matters.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We maintain &#8212; we maintain these in order to discuss safe, orderly, and legal migration.&nbsp; That remains a primary U.S. &#8212; a primary U.S. interest.&nbsp; So, beyond what they will look like &#8212; I mean, to us, they &#8212; this is just a standard operating process and discussions that have been happening over the course of many years.&nbsp; The last ones were, of course, in 2018.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, finally, just on some of the munitions being sent to Ukraine: How does the administration justify sending Claymore munitions, which critics say are quite dangerous and, in their antipersonnel-mine form, have been banned by 160 countries, including Ukraine?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I&#8217;d point you to the Department of Defense to speak to any specifics of the military equipment or assistance we&#8217;re providing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Obviously, we&#8217;re providing this to a country that is facing an invasion by Russia that is targeting their civilians and their people.&nbsp; And this is meant to effectively help them fight that war.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thanks, everyone.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>Since the launch of the Collaborative Migration Management Strategy, the U.S. Government has made progress with its partners on each line of action, setting the strong foundation of collaborative migration management upon which to further build.&nbsp; The February 2, 2021 Executive Order, <em>Creating a Comprehensive Regional Framework to Address the Causes of Migration, to Manage Migration Throughout North and Central America, and to Provide Safe and Orderly Processing of Asylum Seekers at the United States Border</em>, called for a strategy to collaboratively manage migration.&nbsp; The Collaborative Migration Management Strategy, launched on July 29, 2021, identifies and prioritizes actions to strengthen cooperative efforts to manage safe, orderly, and humane migration in North and Central America.&nbsp; Specifically, the Collaborative Migration Management Strategy aims to address urgent humanitarian needs, promote access to protection and legal pathways for migration, improve secure and humane border management, and provide support for returnees to successfully reintegrate into their communities.&nbsp; Addressing these objectives requires sustained cooperation with a broad range of stakeholders, including Congress, civil society, international organizations, the private sector, labor unions, and governments inside and outside the region.<br><br><strong>Stabilize Populations with Acute Needs</strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>Surge U.S. Humanitarian Assistance:</strong>&nbsp; In light of dire conditions and acute suffering faced by millions of people in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, Vice President Harris announced in April 2021 an additional $310 million in U.S. Government support for humanitarian relief and to address food insecurity&nbsp;from&nbsp;the&nbsp;Department of&nbsp;State, USAID, DOD and USDA. &nbsp;This announcement brought the total amount of&nbsp;humanitarian assistance provided by State and USAID to&nbsp;more than $272 million&nbsp;for the responses in Central America and Mexico.&nbsp;&nbsp;DOD additionally allocated or re-aligned a total of $26 million to address the humanitarian drivers of migration, with a focus on El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras projects. &nbsp;USDA increased its original $55 million commitment to support food security by extending two of its existing programs in Guatemala and Honduras by an additional $20 million, bringing the total value to $75 million.<br></li><li><strong>UN Humanitarian Response Plans:&nbsp; </strong>The United Nations (UN) launched the 2021–2022 Humanitarian Response Plans for El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras in response to high-level engagement and direct appeals by the United States, with the UN appealing for $588 million to target 4.3 million people in need of urgent humanitarian assistance.&nbsp; The United States has provided nearly $169 million toward the efforts laid out in the UN Humanitarian Response Plans for El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Expand Access to International Protection</strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>Build and Improve National Asylum Systems:&nbsp; </strong>In Guatemala, the State Department funded the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to continue supporting the Government of Guatemala to build its asylum capacity in line with its national action plan commitments under the Comprehensive Regional Protection and Solutions Framework (MIRPS). &nbsp;Guatemala received more than 1,000 asylum claims in 2021, which is over double the number received in any prior year.&nbsp; In Mexico, the Commission for Refugee Assistance (COMAR) accepted more than 131,000 applications for asylum in 2021, becoming the third highest receiver of claims in the world.&nbsp; With State Department support through UNHCR, COMAR granted asylum to 37,806 individuals in 2021.<br></li><li><strong>Establish Migration Resource Centers (MRCs)</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;With State Department funding, the International Organization for Migration (IOM), UNHCR, and the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) collaborated with the Government of Guatemala to establish three MRCs (referred to locally as Centros de Atención a Personas Migrantes y Refugiadas, or CAPMIRs) in Guatemala City, Tecun Uman, and Quetzaltenango.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, seven mobile units operate as part of the MRC network, covering six departments of Guatemala.&nbsp;&nbsp;The MRCs are located to benefit communities at risk of displacement, with high levels of emigration, and also along transit routes.&nbsp;&nbsp;They are designed to evaluate individuals’ protection, humanitarian, and economic needs in order to provide appropriate services and referrals, and have reached more than 32,000 individuals.<br></li><li><strong>Child Protection:&nbsp; </strong>In Guatemala, the State Department funded UNICEF to support the Guatemalan Migration Institute to establish a new Child Protection Unit (UAPNA), which deployed Child Protection Officers to the southern and northern borders of Guatemala.&nbsp; At the municipal level, State Department funding for UNICEF supported the establishment of Child Protection Offices in 40 percent of the 340 Guatemalan municipalities.&nbsp; In addition, State Department funding for UNHCR supported five departments in Guatemala implementing protocols for foster homes as an alternative care model for unaccompanied children.&nbsp; In Mexico, State Department funding to UNICEF and UNHCR helped child welfare authorities in Tijuana and Ciudad Juarez to eliminate long-standing backlogs of hundreds of best interest determinations for migrant children, which are required by Mexican law for all children encountered by the national migration authority.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Expand Access to Protection in Countries of Origin</strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>Humanitarian and Development Assistance for Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs):&nbsp; </strong>In El Salvador, the State Department supported the UNHCR launch of the Creating Opportunities program to offer technical and professional courses to improve livelihoods of young IDPs and others at risk of violence or exploitation by gangs, including forced recruitment.&nbsp; In Honduras, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) funded psychosocial support, gender-based violence prevention activities, migration awareness, and children’s rights protection information to approximately 5,100 Honduran youth and to over 1,375 returned migrants and IDPs impacted by the 2020 hurricanes.<br></li><li><strong>Detection and Services for Trafficking Victims:&nbsp; </strong>USAID funding in El Salvador supported work at the border to detect and refer victims of trafficking for appropriate services.&nbsp; In Guatemala, the State Department funded the Pan American Development Foundation in partnership with local organizations to improve the detection of human trafficking cases and provide services to over 250 victims, including medical care, mental health support, legal assistance, education, and reintegration services.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Expand Third Country Labor Migration Programs While Improving Worker Protections</strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>Institutional Capacity Building:&nbsp; </strong>USAID supported the Guatemalan Ministry of Labor, the Honduran Ministry of Labor, and the Salvadoran Ministry of Foreign Affairs through the design and implementation of new processes to increase access to seasonal work opportunities abroad, resulting in a record number of H-2B visas issued to nationals of these countries in FY 2021 with further growth expected in FY 2022.&nbsp; In Costa Rica, State Department funding for IOM supported the processing of 18,000 migrant requests in the agricultural temporary labor migration category.&nbsp; In addition, State Department funding for IOM supported a bilateral dialogue forum between the Governments of Belize and El Salvador on opportunities to improve labor migration regularization procedures between both countries.<br></li><li><strong>Expand Support for Migrant Worker Protections:&nbsp; </strong>In El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, USAID funded pre-departure training for seasonal workers on their rights under the H-2 visa program.&nbsp; In El Salvador, State Department funding for IOM supported the participation of officials from the Ministries of Labor and External Affairs in a specialized course on best practices in labor migration management.&nbsp; The Salvadoran Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare also hosted an event to share best practices on ethical recruitment, involving participants from El Salvador, Honduras, and Panama.&nbsp;<br></li><li><strong>Strengthen Worker Outreach and Compliance Assistance:&nbsp; </strong>The U.S. Department of Labor, through its Wage and Hour Division (WHD) redoubled its efforts to conduct outreach to stakeholders regarding the requirements of the H-2A and H-2B programs, as well as the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act. &nbsp;Since August 2021, WHD has conducted 597 outreach events through its district and regional offices.&nbsp; WHD also provided compliance assistance and education to multiple national agricultural employer stakeholders and participated in a cross-departmental presentation hosted by DHS to over 300 stakeholders in addition to interagency meetings with Northern Central America government agencies to explain H-2A program requirements.&nbsp; Finally, WHD published a one-page summary sheet on key H-2A worker protections and shared this information, along with other outreach materials, such as worker rights cards and information on how to file a complaint, with consular staff and USAID contractors for distribution to workers.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Assist and Reintegrate Returned Persons</strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>Expand Reception and Reintegration Services:&nbsp; </strong>Over the last two years, almost 120,000 (22,308 women, 75,271 men, 7,866 girls and 13,740 boys) returned migrants have gone through the USAID-supported reception processes in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. USAID provided almost 9,000 returned or prospective migrants with psycho-social assistance, job skill development and vocational training, job orientation and placement, and reinsertion to school in the three countries.&nbsp; The USAID-supported Reception Center for Returned Migrants in Guatemala City established a permanent presence of officials to issue national identification cards to returnees free of charge, an official clinic and COVID-19 vaccination center for returnees, and the permanent presence of the Ministry of Labor, including initial pilot programs to link returnees with job opportunities.<br></li><li><strong>Support Assisted Voluntary Return (AVR):</strong>&nbsp; From August through December 2021, the State Department funded IOM to administer AVR supporting 1,250 vulnerable migrants in Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, Honduras, and El Salvador.&nbsp; The State Department is funding an IOM regional program to expand AVR to additional countries and nationalities in the Western Hemisphere.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Foster Secure and Humane Management of Borders</strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>Institutional Capacity Building:&nbsp; </strong>In order to manage irregular migration and the growing number of unaccompanied children transiting through and departing from Guatemala, from July through December 2021, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) trained over 600 Government of Guatemala personnel.&nbsp; In addition, DHS mentors in Monterrey, Guadalajara, and Tijuana in Mexico worked alongside Government of Mexico officials to counter human smuggling and fraud.&nbsp; DHS mentoring efforts in Honduras resulted in the arrest of 110 human smugglers in 2021 and the transfer of over 190 unaccompanied migrant children to Honduras’s children and family directorate.&nbsp; These capacity building efforts represent a U.S. Government multi-agency effort to enhance security throughout the law enforcement process, from investigation to arrest to successful prosecution.<br></li><li><strong>Enhance Migrant-Smuggling and Human-Trafficking Investigations and Prosecutions: </strong>DHS information exchange with Mexican and Central American counterparts resulted in multiple leads for Operation Sentinel, an interagency counter-network operation targeting transnational criminal organizations affiliated with the smuggling of migrants.&nbsp; In addition, under Joint Task Force Alpha, the Department of Justice with DHS investigated and prosecuted human smuggling and trafficking groups operating in Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras.&nbsp; In Guatemala, efforts focus on the indictments and extraditions of Guatemalan human smugglers to the United States to face prosecution.&nbsp; In Honduras, DHS is supporting Operation Scorpion, a border surge initiative of the Honduran National Police, targeting human smugglers and traffickers.<br></li><li><strong>Increase Information Sharing with and among Regional Partners:</strong>&nbsp; State Department foreign assistance funding supported a regional effort to share criminal intelligence about transnational criminal organizations and associated criminals in Central America, with a focus on migrant smuggling and human trafficking.&nbsp; During 2021, this effort facilitated the identification of suspected members and networks of transnational criminal organizations.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Strengthen Regional Public Messaging on Migration</strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>Promote Accurate Information Countering Human Smugglers</strong>: The State Department provided factual information about U.S. immigration policies, including digital content specifically for Haitian migrants reaching more than 1.5 million individuals between August and December 2021. &nbsp;The State Department supported IOM to expand its Migration Information Portal and register over 4,500 new portal users from July to December 2021 to provide information on legal migration pathways in the region.&nbsp; USAID also launched migration messaging campaigns in the region: in El Salvador, the “<em>De Aquí Soy</em>” campaign launched in September 2021 and reached almost two million people in three months; in Honduras, the two-part documentary “In the Claws of the Coyote” reached approximately 800,000 viewers; and in Guatemala, the “<em>Quédate Aquí</em>” video series was seen by more than 1.6 million viewers on local TV.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Expand Access to Lawful Pathways for Protection and Opportunity in the United States</strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>Restart and Expand Central American Minors (CAM) Program and other U.S. Refugee Admissions Program Processing: </strong>In September 2021, the State Department and DHS expanded the eligibility categories for U.S.-based relatives who can apply for their children in Northern Central America to access the CAM program.&nbsp; State is working to streamline the CAM application and has put out a Notice for Funding Opportunities for organizations to have dedicated funding to work on CAM applications.&nbsp; Since its restart, cases for nearly 1,700 children have been either reopened or submitted.&nbsp; As of April 13, there have been 1,023 beneficiaries from CAM and other U.S. refugee admissions programs in Central America who arrived in the United States in FY 2022.<br></li><li><strong>Increase Access to Temporary Work Visas While Ensuring Worker Protections:&nbsp; </strong>DHS and DOL will issue two temporary final rules this fiscal year, providing for supplemental visa allocations of 18,000 H-2B visas reserved for nationals of Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, or Haiti (6,500 allotted for the first half of FY 2022 and 11,500 for the second half of FY 2022).&nbsp; These follow an H-2B supplemental allocation that DHS and DOL issued in May 2021, reserving an allocation for the first time for Northern Central American nationals.&nbsp; The United States has also undertaken efforts to significantly increase the number of Northern Central American agricultural workers who receive an H-2A visa, and has conducted outreach with stakeholders and provided information on program requirements and worker protections.&nbsp; <em>Cierto Global</em>, a non-profit ethical recruiter, has received private funding to establish operations in Guatemala in order to ethically recruit, train, and place H-2A agricultural workers on farms in the United States.&nbsp; USAID facilitated contacts between <em>Cierto Global</em> and the Government of Guatemala to help <em>Cierto</em> quickly establish operations in Guatemala.<br></li><li><strong>High-Level Donor Roundtable for Humanitarian Response Plans:</strong>&nbsp; In order to internationalize the response to the UN Humanitarian Response Plans and broaden the funding base, the United States, Canada, and European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations, in partnership with the UN, co-hosted a high-level virtual donor roundtable meeting in November 2021.<br></li><li><strong>Migration Ministerial Meeting:&nbsp; </strong>In October 2021, the United States and Colombia co-hosted a Ministerial Meeting in Bogotá on the Causes and Challenges of Irregular Migration, resulting in a Joint Declaration signed by 17 countries from our region, reiterating the United States’ commitment to working collaboratively to address the migration challenges throughout the region.&nbsp; In April 2022, the United States and Panama co-hosted a further Ministerial Meeting in Panama City to redouble collaborative efforts on the regional response to migration and displacement.&nbsp;</li></ul>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Economic Club of New York</em></p>



<p><em>As Prepared for Delivery</em></p>



<ol type="I"><li><strong>Introduction</strong></li></ol>



<p>Good afternoon, everyone.&nbsp; Thanks to Barbara Van Allen and the entire team at the Economic Club of New York for hosting me today.&nbsp; It’s great to be here.</p>



<p>In the early days of the Republic, Alexander Hamilton prepared a series of reports to Congress that laid the intellectual foundations for the young American economy.&nbsp; The first report was about securing the public credit.&nbsp; The second was about establishing a national bank.&nbsp; And the third—his 1791 <em>Report on the Subject of Manufactures</em>—offered a vision for a strong industrial system in America.</p>



<p>In the United States, he argued, “the public purse must supply the deficiency of private resource.&nbsp; In what can it be so useful as in prompting and improving the efforts of industry?”</p>



<p>That imperative has a contested history in American economic policy. &nbsp;For much of the last half-century, even uttering the words “industrial policy” was met with something between derision and concern.&nbsp; But our economy has changed, and the world has changed, too.</p>



<p>My core point today is this: it is a critical and urgent imperative for the United States to chart and implement a <em><u>modern American industrial strategy</u></em>.</p>



<p>Properly conceived and implemented, an industrial strategy <em>is</em> an economic resilience and capacity strategy.&nbsp; Investments in our industrial capacity will leave our economy better positioned to weather future shocks—and to help all Americans thrive.</p>



<p>Ten months ago, I proposed the idea of a modern American industrial strategy to describe what animated President Biden’s approach to strengthening the economy.&nbsp; The turbulent, historic economic events of the last year have underscored the case. &nbsp;The question should move from “<em>why</em> should we pursue an industrial strategy?” to “<em>how </em>do we pursue one successfully?”</p>



<p>When the pandemic began, our economy suffered its sharpest contraction since the end of the Second World War.&nbsp; Job losses were the worst since the Great Depression—with communities of color and young people hit hardest.</p>



<p>President Biden came into office and set the nation on a new course, taking immediate action to fight the virus and deliver economic relief. &nbsp;History will judge the virtues of our crisis response—there’s room for debate.&nbsp; But there’s no question the President’s strategy helped generate the strongest recovery in modern history—with the fastest economic growth in nearly four decades; the strongest labor market recovery ever recorded; and record progress for Black and Hispanic Americans, the long-term unemployed, and others often left behind in a slow-growth economy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yes, our economy faces significant challenges.&nbsp; Our convulsive, pandemic-constrained recovery has produced high inflation globally and domestically.&nbsp; The pandemic exposed structural vulnerabilities—resulting from decades-long underinvestment in our industrial strength—that have continued to generate supply-chain bottlenecks across the economy.&nbsp; And now, Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine has compounded these challenges—exacerbating supply constraints, pushing up prices, and straining the post-Cold War world order.</p>



<p>Even so, the United States retains a stronger economic position than any other major country in the world, based on economic growth, job growth, consumer spending, and household balance sheets—even taking inflation into account.</p>



<p>What we have now is an opportunity, amid historic uncertainty.&nbsp; We should seize it—with an economic strategy that matches the moment.&nbsp;</p>



<ol type="I"><li><strong>Reviewing Our Progress</strong></li></ol>



<p>Today, I’d like to take stock of how far we’ve come and reassess the case for an American industrial strategy going forward. &nbsp;For the past year, we’ve centered on two core principles:</p>



<p><strong><em>First</em></strong>, strategic public investment must serve as the backbone to a strong industrial base.</p>



<p>The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is a case in point.&nbsp; Yes, it will make our supply chains more durable and reduce price pressures.&nbsp; Yes, it will connect more people to more places, create jobs, and push innovations from laboratory to market.</p>



<p>But it also represents the most significant effort in the last half-century to make a sustained, long-term public investment in America.&nbsp; This year, for the first time in two decades, America’s infrastructure investment will grow faster than China’s.</p>



<p>We need to build on this model.&nbsp; We’re within reach of passing the Bipartisan Innovation Act, which will help reclaim America’s leadership in semiconductors; authorize historic investments in basic R&amp;D; advance our leadership in technologies like artificial intelligence, 3D printing, telecommunications, and biotechnology; and spur innovation in places previously left behind.</p>



<p>The economic and national security threat of industrial weakness is accelerating.&nbsp; Congress urgently needs to send this legislation to the President’s desk so we can get to work rebuilding our industrial strength without delay.</p>



<p><strong>S</strong><strong><em>econd</em></strong>, we need to identify sectors where private industry, on its own, has not mobilized toward our core economic and national security interests—and lay the foundation for investment.</p>



<p>There’s a longstanding critique of industrial policy that it amounts to government picking “winners and losers.”&nbsp; There’s wisdom in this concern.&nbsp; Ill-conceived government interventions in private markets can produce inefficient and, worse, corrupting outcomes.&nbsp; But allowing this critique to reflexively hold back action misses the current global moment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To make critical goods, American companies need access to key inputs like raw materials.&nbsp; They need secure and reliable supply chains that the private market won’t deliver on its own—and potentially <em>cannot</em> deliver if geopolitical dynamics prevent them from accessing those inputs.&nbsp; These gaps can have major security implications.</p>



<p>Individual companies will rise and fall on their own merits.&nbsp; But it’s incumbent on us to support an ecosystem that enables American businesses to stand at the vanguard of solving these problems.</p>



<p>That’s what we have sought to do. &nbsp;Last June, we published a first-ever diagnosis and prescription for our most acute supply-chain vulnerabilities.&nbsp; Earlier this year, we released detailed resilience strategies across sectors like defense, public health, IT, and energy.</p>



<p>Consider critical minerals.&nbsp; Lithium, nickel, and cobalt are building blocks in everything from computers to appliances to electric vehicles and other clean-energy technologies—and demand is set to skyrocket.</p>



<p>Yet the United States depends heavily on foreign sources for many of these critical minerals.&nbsp; China, for instance, is estimated to control 85 percent of refining capacity for rare earths.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So far, private investment has fallen short of our national needs.&nbsp; But through strategic coordination, we can open channels for companies to invest.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s why President Biden invoked the Defense Production Act to support domestic production and address immediate security risks, consistent with our values.&nbsp; That’s why the Defense Department contracted with a Nevada-based company to establish the first end-to-end domestic supply chain for “permanent magnets”—with capacity to power 500,000 electric vehicles per year.&nbsp; And that’s why the Department of Energy is poised to invest nearly $7 billion to strengthen our end-to-end domestic battery supply chain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’re seeing companies respond.&nbsp; They’ve announced more than $200 billion in critical manufacturing investments in the United States.&nbsp; Manufacturing has seen its strongest job growth in three decades.</p>



<ol type="I"><li><strong>Re-underwriting the Case for Our Industrial Strategy</strong></li></ol>



<p>We can be proud of this progress.&nbsp; But the global economic landscape is evolving rapidly.</p>



<p>Russia’s unconscionable invasion of Ukraine is imposing a global supply shock on an already supply-constrained global economy. &nbsp;And COVID remains an acute risk to global supply chains, particularly in places like China.</p>



<p>Given this evolving landscape, how do we re-underwrite the case for a modern American industrial strategy?&nbsp; I would offer four reflections.</p>



<p><strong><em>First</em></strong>, we need to make our economy more resilient while working to lower price pressures across the economy today and over time.</p>



<p>Given the supply and inflationary pressures we’re facing, some may argue that investing for resilience and industrial strength tomorrow could push pricing higher today. &nbsp;This critique counsels caution, but misses an important point: ignoring resilience is ultimately more expensive.</p>



<p>The pandemic laid this bare.&nbsp; Our supply chains were put to test, and the allure of “just in time” turned into a cacophony of disruptions, long lead times, complexity, and massive costs.</p>



<p>Companies are confronting this reality.&nbsp; They’re recognizing that when disruptions happen, well-prepared companies can bounce back and even gain market share over competitors. &nbsp;Yet investments in resilience require time and resources up front, when the whole economy is supply-constrained.</p>



<p>We recognize this. &nbsp;It is why we’re aggressively working to make our global logistics supply chain more fluid and lower price pressures right now across the economy.&nbsp; These actions create space for longer-term investments in industrial resilience and capacity to take root.</p>



<p>We’ve worked to move our ports to 24/7 operations and reduce container dwell times, which are down 50 percent.&nbsp; We’ve also worked to recruit more truck drivers and improve the quality of trucking jobs; and trucking employment is up 35,000 over pre-pandemic levels.</p>



<p>Looking ahead, we need to bring our supply-chain logistics capabilities into the twenty-first century.&nbsp; We are now working to develop a reliable <em>digital</em> infrastructure to make our supply chains more agile.&nbsp; We should consider stress-testing private-sector supply chains to future shocks.&nbsp; The pandemic has underscored how major physical shocks can be both impulsive and inexorable, and we know climate change will only exacerbate them.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>Second</em></strong>, we need a modern American industrial strategy that expands and enhances international economic engagement.</p>



<p>I hope this point rings clear: You are not witnessing an American retreat from the global economy.&nbsp; Rather, you’re witnessing a new stage in how and why we engage—which will better serve the American middle class and American workers, while prioritizing our key global partners.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For America and the world, economic concerns are becoming more tightly linked to national security and national interests more broadly.&nbsp; In this environment, any thoughtful industrial strategy should prioritize partnerships with countries that respect fundamental norms and values—countries we can rely on—around transparency, open and fair rules-based trade, worker’s rights, and equity and opportunity.</p>



<p>This modern industrial strategy is centered on the reality that it’s neither feasible nor advisable to produce everything domestically.&nbsp; We need to <em>both</em> build resilience and capacity at home <em>and </em>forge more effective partnerships abroad. &nbsp;The Administration has sought to show that this clear-eyed approach to global economic ties can work—that we can assemble broad coalitions that amplify our own domestic strength.</p>



<p>This is what we’ve done in renewing our economic relationship with Europe, including the world’s first carbon-based sectoral deal on steel and aluminum trade. &nbsp;It’s also what we did—in bold and serious terms—when we led an historic global tax agreement with 136 countries to halt the race-to-the-bottom on corporate taxes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And it’s what we aim to do in the Indo-Pacific region, with an economic framework for sustained collaboration on everything from data flows to supply chains to clean energy.</p>



<p>We should consider the full scope of tools for cooperation—whether it’s strengthening a partnership with one trusted ally, reaching a broad multilateral agreement, or, as Secretary Yellen recently said, constructing a network of “plurilateral” trade arrangements.</p>



<p>We also need to reexamine existing barriers—whether that’s through additional “tariff exclusions” processes or other warranted steps, to make sure our trade policy serves American economic priorities.</p>



<p><strong><em>Third</em></strong>, a modern American industrial strategy needs to demonstrate that America can build—fast, as we’ve done before, and fairly, as we’ve sometimes failed to do.</p>



<p>Core to rebuilding our industrial base is exactly that: <em>building</em>.&nbsp; We need to unpack the many constraints that cause America to lag other major countries—including those with strong labor, environmental, and historical protections—in delivering infrastructure on budget and on time.</p>



<p>At the same time, past efforts to build fast often entailed discrimination and subjugation—running roughshod over already disadvantaged communities and places.&nbsp; Our generation must do better.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’ll need to confront complex, multilayered challenges that lack easy answers.&nbsp; For instance, building more affordable housing is vitally important, but it doesn’t happen instantly.&nbsp; It requires action by many stakeholders.&nbsp; It involves changing norms, incentives, and activities in highly localized ways.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The good news: the solutions don’t map onto traditional political, economic, or geographic divides.&nbsp; And the federal government can lead by example:</p>



<ul><li>We can establish coordinated federal decisions on permitting, instead of siloed agency actions, so projects can move forward with confidence, without sacrificing our values.</li></ul>



<ul><li>We can make the most of federal incentives, like conditioning transportation grants on land-use policies that help us build more efficiently and equitably.</li></ul>



<ul><li>We can pursue place-based policies—and build in geographies that may not only cost less but also have greater impact. The pandemic’s fundamental, structural disruption to how and where we work offers a unique moment to broaden the geographic aperture of economic opportunity in America.</li></ul>



<p>Most building will be carried out by state and local partners.&nbsp; The federal government will need to build capacity; demand progress over inertia; and learn from local innovation.</p>



<p>From the transcontinental railroad in the nineteenth century to the interstate highway system in the twentieth, Americans have shown their capacity to build great things.&nbsp; One powerful example stands a few blocks from here: the Empire State Building.&nbsp; It was constructed in just over a year.&nbsp; Nearly a century later, it remains an icon of American ambition and ingenuity.&nbsp; That’s the drive we’ll need to bring to our generation’s challenges.</p>



<p>One <strong><em>last</em></strong> reflection: these priorities are overlapping and reinforcing.&nbsp; There’s no clearer example than building resilience to energy shocks.</p>



<p>The global market for hydrocarbons is not a free market.&nbsp; It’s influenced by the geopolitical impulses of petrostates, some of which don’t share our interests or values.&nbsp; At the same time, the latest U.N. climate panel report confirms we have a narrow window to avoid the most devastating impacts of climate change.</p>



<p>In these two realities lies an opportunity: an industrial strategy for true energy security will reduce our reliance on volatile commodities and protect against the costs of the climate crisis.&nbsp; As the President said recently, “We need to choose long-term security over energy and climate vulnerability.”</p>



<p>By enacting long-term, technology-neutral incentives to generate zero-carbon energy and innovation, we can lay the foundation for more American-made clean-energy technologies and bolster domestic supply chains.&nbsp; We can partner with allies to expand our collective capacity to produce clean energy, while opening new export markets for American products.</p>



<p>And we can do it in a way that lowers immediate costs for Americans, keeps our affordable-energy advantage, and accelerates growth in energy communities transitioning toward industries of the future. &nbsp;Congress urgently needs to act here as well. &nbsp;</p>



<ol type="I"><li><strong>Conclusion</strong></li></ol>



<p>From Delta and Omicron, to supply-chain disruptions, and now to Russian aggression—our economy has shown striking resilience over the past year.&nbsp; But our most important work lies ahead.</p>



<p>What people will remember fifty years from now is whether we as a nation met this global moment.&nbsp; Did our economy emerge more resilient?&nbsp; Did it set the pace for generation-defining technologies?&nbsp; Did our alliances emerge more cooperative and unified in purpose?</p>



<p>In his <em>Report on Manufactures</em>, Hamilton argued that expanding American industry would be “favorable to national independence and safety.”&nbsp; America had just achieved independence, but building a strong industrial system would truly secure it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The American economy has been transformed many times over since then.&nbsp; Yet this economic and national security imperative endures.</p>



<p>Hamilton had one more insight we should heed today.&nbsp; “To increase the total mass of industry” in a country, he wrote, “is ultimately beneficial to every part of it.”&nbsp; We must ensure the gains are shared broadly by all Americans.</p>



<p>And we need the business community to step up and join us in this national renewal.  If we strike the right balance, the American economy—and our democracy—can emerge more vigorous, more prosperous, and more resilient to whatever challenges come our way.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>President Biden is committed to ensuring federal resources and opportunities that can benefit rural America actually reach rural America. Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is launching the <strong>Rural Partners Network (RPN),</strong> a new whole-of-government effort led by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to transform the way federal agencies partner with rural places to create economic opportunity.</p>



<p>The Biden-Harris Administration is investing historic resources in rural communities so they can continue to compete and succeed in the 21<sup>st</sup> century. The President’s American Rescue Plan provided billions of dollars to rural workers, local governments, and small businesses to rebuild from the COVID-19 pandemic, and President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is a once-in-a-generation investment in affordable high-speed internet, clean drinking water, clean and reliable electricity, and better roads and bridges for rural communities across America. However, just making resources available is not enough—the federal government must better serve rural communities, so that they can take full advantage of these unprecedented opportunities.</p>



<p>To transform how the federal government partners with and delivers economic opportunity for rural communities across the United States, RPN will bring the federal government to rural America. New federal field staff will be placed in more than 25 rural communities in multiple U.S. states, Tribal Nations and territories to help local leaders navigate and access the federal resources they need to build a strong and vibrant economy. Through this unique partnership, RPN staff will also identify challenges preventing rural communities from accessing federal support to inform the work of the Rural Prosperity Interagency Policy Council, a whole-of-government task force that will ensure rural places are prioritized in Washington. RPN communities will have a new direct line to D.C. to foster a federal government that delivers for <em>all</em> rural communities.</p>



<p>To begin making the federal government work better for rural America, the Rural Partners Network is:</p>



<p><strong>Helping rural communities identify and leverage critical resources with the partnership of on-the-ground federal staff</strong>.</p>



<p>To boost local capacity, the Biden Administration will deploy new RPN staff to help communities access the full breadth of federal resources for community-led economic development, working in close coordination with: local leaders in government, business, and community organizations; federal agency field offices; existing federal efforts such as <a href="https://energycommunities.gov/">Interagency Working Group on Coal and Power Plant Communities and Economic Revitalization</a> and the President’s <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/01/27/fact-sheet-president-biden-takes-executive-actions-to-tackle-the-climate-crisis-at-home-and-abroad-create-jobs-and-restore-scientific-integrity-across-federal-government/">Justice40 Initiative</a>; and staff of the Regional Commissions. RPN Directors will be placed in states, territories and Tribal Nations to coordinate RPN activities, and RPN Liaisons will be placed in selected community networks to work with local leaders on an economic development vision and to secure the funds to make it a reality.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While these staff will be funded by USDA, they will have a whole-of-government mandate: help rural communities create economic opportunity by leveraging resources from all federal departments and agencies. To support this effort, 13 key agencies are dedicating a D.C.-based point person or team to serve as a front door for RPN staff and communities as they navigate the resources available across the federal government. These agencies participate in regular convenings of the Rural Prosperity Interagency Policy Council, co-led by the White House Domestic Policy Council and USDA.</p>



<p>Today, the Biden Administration is announcing the launch of this new program in selected community networks this year. In cohort 1, by the end of May, RPN staff will be on the ground supporting selected community networks in the following states and Tribal Nations:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Arizona</strong>:<ul><li>San Carlos Apache Tribe</li></ul><ul><li>Tohono O&#8217;odham Nation</li></ul><ul><li>Cocopah Indian Tribe</li></ul></li><li><strong>Georgia</strong><ul><li>Southwest Georgia Regional Commission: Counties of Mitchell, Baker, Calhoun, Colquitt, Decatur, Dougherty, Early, Grady, Lee, Seminole, Miller, Terrell, Thomas, and Worth</li></ul><ul><li>Ben Hill County and City of Fitzgerald<strong></strong></li></ul><ul><li>Emanuel County and City of Twin City</li></ul></li><li><strong>Kentucky</strong><ul><li>Fulton County Partnership*<strong>: </strong>Cities of Fulton, Hickman, and Cayce</li></ul><ul><li>Kentucky Highlands: Counties of Bell*, Perry*, Harlan*, Leslie*, Letcher*, Whitley, Knox, Clay*</li></ul></li><li><strong>Mississippi</strong><ul><li>Washington County Economic Alliance: Counties of Washington, Bolivar, Sunflower, and Leflore</li></ul><ul><li>Greater Grenada-Lake District: Counties of Grenada and Yalobusha</li></ul><ul><li>North Delta Planning and Development Collaborative: Counties of Coahoma, Quitman, and Tunica</li></ul></li><li><strong>New Mexico</strong><ul><li>Northern New Mexico Pathways: Counties of San Miguel, Taos, Mora, and Colfax</li></ul><ul><li>Southwest New Mexico Council of Governments: Counties of Catron, Grant, Hidalgo, and Luna</li></ul><ul><li>Mesilla Valley Partnership: Doña Ana County</li></ul></li></ul>



<p>*Priority Energy Community as determined by the Interagency Working Group on Coal and Power Plant Communities and Economic Revitalization.</p>



<p>These states and community networks were selected by USDA based on quantitative and qualitative factors, including levels of economic distress and readiness of the communities and local stakeholder organizations to participate in RPN. As part of the selection process, USDA conducted community engagement sessions with local community leaders. The communities themselves determined the composition of their networks.</p>



<p>In addition to this first cohort, RPN will expand to <strong>Nevada, North Carolina, Puerto Rico, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Tribal communities in Alaska</strong> in a second cohort to launch by the end of August. If provided the support from Congress requested in the President’s FY23 Budget, RPN will continue expanding to ultimately serve all 50 states, as well as more Tribal Nations and territories.</p>



<p><strong>Empowering rural communities to foster a federal government that better delivers for rural America</strong><strong>. </strong>RPN field staff will be tasked with feeding key information to federal agencies on community needs and barriers to accessing federal resources. Agencies will then take this information and use it to drive policy changes that address the unique challenges faced by rural communities. As a result, RPN will not only support selected RPN community networks but inform changes that make the federal government better deliver for all rural communities.</p>



<p>Through this new direct line between rural communities and Washington, D.C., the Biden Administration will change business as usual and work across agencies to coordinate technical assistance to rural communities, share rural data and measures of success, and align grant requirements. Members of Congress across the political spectrum have called for this whole-of-government approach, including U.S. Senators Catherine Cortez Masto, Joni Ernst, Kirsten Gillibrand, Chuck Grassley, and Mark Kelly, and U.S. Representatives Angie Craig, Dan Newhouse, Cindy Axne, Adrian Smith, Tom O’Halleran, and Randy Feenstra.</p>



<p>The federal agencies and regional commissions participating in the Rural Prosperity Interagency Policy Council include:</p>



<ul><li>Department of Agriculture</li><li>Department of Commerce</li><li>Department of Education</li><li>Department of Energy</li><li>Department of Health and Human Services</li><li>Department of Housing and Urban Development</li><li>Department of the Interior</li><li>Department of Labor</li><li>Department of Transportation</li><li>Department of the Treasury</li><li>Department of Veterans Affairs</li><li>Environmental Protection Agency</li><li>Small Business Administration</li><li>Appalachian Regional Commission</li><li>Delta Regional Authority</li><li>Denali Commission</li><li>Northern Border Regional Commission</li></ul>



<p><strong>Creating new whole-of-government resources for rural communities.</strong> Agencies will contribute to whole-of-government rural economic development resource guides and other informational material that will help all rural communities better identify and access federal funds. Agencies will also proactively conduct outreach to rural communities and rural leaders to disseminate information, offer technical assistance support, and seek input regarding the economic development barriers they face and support they need.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">New Hampshire Port Authority<br>Portsmouth, New Hampshire</p>



<p>2:53 P.M. EDT</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Thank you, thank you, thank you, Mr. Mayor.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Please, take a seat if you have one.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I once, several years ago, said, “Everybody take a seat.”&nbsp; There were about &#8212; it was an evening &#8212; there were about 2,000 people out in the &#8212; in a football field, and it was towards the end of a campaign.&nbsp; I said, “Have a seat.”&nbsp; And they all looked at me like, “We’re standing &#8212; all of it.”&nbsp; (Laughter.) &nbsp;I couldn’t see.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>But anyway, thank you very, very much.</p>



<p>Look, it’s great to be here in Portsmouth with your senator, Maggie Hassan, who’s been one of my friends for a long, long time, and to talk about investments we’re making to modernize this port and create jobs and bring down the cost for families in this region in everyday life.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Maggie was a key player in the Infrastructure Law.&nbsp; And it’s making a difference here in New Hampshire and, I might add, around the country.&nbsp; She made the case for high-speed Internet everywhere in New Hampshire and, you know, protecting New Hampshire’s coastlines from rising sea levels and extreme storms, and for the investments in New Hampshire’s roads and bridges, ports and waterways.</p>



<p>And, Representative Chris Pappas, thank you for a passport into your district.&nbsp; Chris, where are you?&nbsp; Is Chris over here?&nbsp; Well, thanks for the passport, ole buddy, into the district.&nbsp; I appreciate it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And he’s a member of the committee that got this bill across the finish line.&nbsp; Getting big ideas into an actual bill is hard work, requiring getting into the nitty-gritty details and without losing the big picture.</p>



<p>(A baby babbles.)</p>



<p>I agree.&nbsp; I agree completely.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; By the way, kids are allowed to do anything they want when I speak &#8212; at all.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; So don’t worry about it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And &#8212; but, Chris, thank you for all the work you did.&nbsp; And you did a hell of a lot of work to get this done, and always making the economic case for how clean water, access to the Internet, rebuilding a bridge, investing in this port matters to your lives, the lives of your families, and, quite frankly, to the entire region.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And Representative Annie Kuster, an old good friend of mine &#8212; it’s good to see you as well, Annie.&nbsp; Thank you for everything.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>Annie and I have talked a lot about what we need to do to support New Hampshire’s parents and give them just a little bit of breathing room because sometimes things get tight.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And even though she can’t be here, I also wanted to recognize Jeanne Shaheen, who is well represented today by her husband Billy and the family.&nbsp; Billy, where are you?&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; If I can only have one guy in the foxhole with me, I’d pick Billy.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Good to see you, Billy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>And &#8212; and I want to thank &#8212; because she’s sitting next to her.&nbsp; She doesn’t hold any office but a really good friend of mine.&nbsp; Her mom used to be a significant political figure up here.&nbsp; It’s great to see you, kiddo.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Thank you, thank you for being here.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>I also want to thank Chris and Maggie and Jeanne and Annie for all they did to prove that America can do big things when we work together.&nbsp; You know, we &#8212; we can build a better America.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’re the only country in the world that, I believe, that has come out of every crisis we’ve faced stronger than when we went in &#8212; literally stronger than we went in.&nbsp; That’s the history of the journey of this country.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>And this port is a perfect example.&nbsp; A lot of important things come into these terminals and particularly this one &#8212; from salt to de-ice roads, to 85 percent of the home heating oil used in this state.</p>



<p>And a lot of important things go out of this port as well, like the massive reactor assemblies for nuclear power plants that are manufactured by Westinghouse Electric here in New Hampshire.</p>



<p>Recently, this port has been an important link to more construction equipment and materials for a $2.3 billion project that I’ve authorized in Portsmouth Naval Shipyard &#8212; 2.3 billion.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; But it wouldn’t happen without you all and what you’ve done.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, I know they say the port is in Maine, but I’ve always thought it was in New Hampshire.&nbsp; But &#8212; (applause) &#8212; that’s what Billy taught me.&nbsp; And where the Navy’s nuclear-powered attack submarines are built as well and are stationed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Look, all in, this port supports over 2,300 jobs &#8212; 2,300 jobs; adds $275 million to this region’s economy, and that’s not even counting the more than 6,000 civilian contractors and jobs here at &#8212; over at the Navy yard.&nbsp; Jobs in Maine, New Hampshire, and all around the region.</p>



<p>But this port has even more potential than that.&nbsp; Until recently, the area in the harbor called the “turning basin” was only 800 feet long and often meant that pilots had to turn around a 765-foot ship in 800 feet.&nbsp; I call that tough parallel parking, man.</p>



<p>But seriously &#8212; and it meant that, you know, to be safe, some of the ships could only come in or sail out on high tide, they could only sail at night, or when there was &#8212; they couldn’t sail when there was too much wind.&nbsp; They couldn’t &#8212; and &#8212; because they’d get knocked off course.</p>



<p>And that &#8212; here’s why it matters: When you keep a ship in dock after the cargo has been delivered, it can cost $90,000 a day when that ship is in port.&nbsp; And those costs get paid on &#8212; get passed on to you, consumers &#8212; whatever it happens to be.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It also has been a problem for decades.&nbsp; But with an $18 million investment from the Army Corps of Engineers and the help of Maggie and Chris, the port &#8212; and union labor &#8212; we widened that turning basin to 1,200 feet.&nbsp; We got it done.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>Now it’s easier, faster, and cheaper, and safer for ships to get in and out.</p>



<p>And the port can welcome larger ships with more cargo, like the massive towers and hubs needed to &#8212; for offshore wind farms.</p>



<p>Look, we’ve also announced an additional $1.7 million investment to dredge &#8212; another tricky part of a shipping channel where the sands build up.</p>



<p>Without that dredging project, the port might need more restrictions on what ships can and can’t pass through this harbor.</p>



<p>Instead of turning away business, we’re sending a message: This port is open for business and will be for a long time.</p>



<p>And we’re sending the same message with our investments in roads and bridges here in New Hampshire.</p>



<p>Back in November, Maggie, Chris, and Annie were with me when I visited Pemi &#8212; the Pemi bridge in Woodstock &#8212; a couple of hours just northwest of here.</p>



<p>The bridge opened in 1939.&nbsp; Not a big bridge, but it solved big problems.&nbsp; Local businesses depended on it.&nbsp; School buses crossed it every day.&nbsp; Without the bridge, the trucks on the other side of the river would have to take a 10-mile detour to get around to the other side of the river.</p>



<p>Folks, when fires and emergencies &#8212; every single mile matters and counts how long it takes to get there.</p>



<p>Right now, there are nearly 200 bridges deemed deficient</p>



<p>in New Hampshire alone.&nbsp; There’s about 315 such bridges in Maine.&nbsp; And many of these are fast-track &#8212; fast &#8212; less-trafficked bridges that are essential to small towns and rural areas, for farmers and small businesses.</p>



<p>Let me give you an example.&nbsp; I was just in Pittsburgh not long ago &#8212; I guess over &#8212; a little over a month ago.&nbsp; And I got there the morning that one of its bridges collapsed.&nbsp; The bridge was built in 1939, if I’m not mistaken, and had been put on a list of being dangerous.&nbsp; It was about a 12-story drop from the middle of that bridge down to a small creek.&nbsp; And it was in a &#8212; but it was a ravine that covered about 300 yards.</p>



<p>Had it not been &#8212; had it not been a snow day before, there would have been a lot of school buses on that bridge.&nbsp; A lot of kids would have been killed.&nbsp; I’m not joking.&nbsp; You probably saw it on the front page of every paper in America.</p>



<p>Well, guess what?&nbsp; It’s happening all over the country.&nbsp; Fortunately, it didn’t happen there.&nbsp; Fortunately, there was no one on the bridge.&nbsp; There were &#8212; actually, there were four vehicles.&nbsp; No one got killed.</p>



<p>And, you know, I was &#8212; when I was doing the Recovery Act in our last administration &#8212; Obama-Biden &#8212; I was in Pittsburgh &#8212; excuse me, in Pennsylvania, in Western Pennsylvania, in a small town.&nbsp; And in the process, I looked at a bridge, and they couldn’t &#8212; their fire department was on one side of the bridge, and, literally, from here to that holding tank outside here, was &#8212; on the other side there was a shopping center and a school.&nbsp; Well, guess what?&nbsp; Their fire &#8212; you couldn’t get across the bridge; you had to go 10 miles to get around, go up over the bridge, if &#8212; could work, and get back down.&nbsp; People dying in that 10 miles of the fire truck getting there in the middle of a fire.</p>



<p>This matters.&nbsp; So we’re making a historic investments in fixing these bridges.</p>



<p>This year alone, we’re delivering $45 million to fix your bridges here in New Hampshire.&nbsp; This year alone.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>You know, the last fella who had this job kept talking about “Infrastructure Week” for four years.  (Laughter.)  Well, we not only took Infrastructure &#8212; we have “Infrastructure Decade.”  (Applause.)  This is going on.  It’s a billion 200 million dollars.</p>



<p>You know, we used to have the finest infrastructure in the world.&nbsp; We now rank number 13 in the quality of our infrastructure.&nbsp; China is ahead of us.&nbsp; So many other countries have moved.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Folks, this matters.&nbsp; It matters to our safety, our security, our health, and a whole range of other &#8212;</p>



<p>Not only that, about 700 miles of highway in New Hampshire are in poor condition.&nbsp; It’s estimated that the driving on those roads &#8212; those 700 miles &#8212; roughly 700 miles &#8212; that need repairs costs New Hampshire drivers at least an average of $476 a year extra in gas and repairs and longer commute times.&nbsp; That’s a $476 hidden tax on New Hampshire drivers.</p>



<p>Look, thanks to the Infrastructure Law, we’re making the most significant investment in modernizing our roads and bridges</p>



<p>since the Interstate Highway System was built with Eisenhower.</p>



<p>We’re also going to start to replace the 100 percent &#8212; all 100 percent of lead water pipes and service lines going into our homes and our schools.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>There are 10 million homes and 400,000 schools and preschools and daycare centers that have lead water pipes bringing the water in.&nbsp; Many of that causes mental illness, brain damage.&nbsp; It’s really important.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’re also going to address what they call PFAS; it’s a dangerous forever chemicals that are a threat to drinking water</p>



<p>here in New Hampshire and other states &#8212; something that Senator Shaheen has championed.</p>



<p>Look, every American and every child should be able to</p>



<p>turn on a faucet, drink clean water, which will also create thousands of good-paying jobs for plumbers, pipefitters, and the folks digging those channels.</p>



<p>And, by the way, thanks to the American Rescue Plan, New Hampshire is already seeing $150 million being put into drinking water, wastewater, and storm sewer projects in this state as I speak.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>Maggie, Chris, and Annie, we share a core belief: High-speed Internet is essential &#8212; essential &#8212; to success in the 21st century.</p>



<p>But even today, 1 in every 10 people in New Hampshire &#8212; every 1 in 10 households don’t have high-speed Internet.  That’s a lot of place where there’s no broadband or &#8212; infrastructure at all in New Hampshire.</p>



<p>It’s not just New Hampshire families, but for New Hampshire businesses as well.</p>



<p>This law is going to make high-speed Internet affordable and available everywhere in New Hampshire, Maine, and the region &#8212; urban, suburban, rural.&nbsp; And it’s going to create jobs. &nbsp;Thousands of union techni- &#8212; thousands of union technicians are going to be laying down these broadband lines.</p>



<p>And never again should a parent have to sit in their car in a McDonald’s parking lot &#8212; literally &#8212; so that their child can get access to high-speed Internet to do their homework over the Internet.&nbsp; Literally.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Folks, look, the law also builds up our &#8212; our resilience to extreme weather.</p>



<p>Fifteen years ago this week, this state experienced its second 100-year flood in the space of 11 months.&nbsp; Cars submerged.&nbsp; Thousands of evacuations.&nbsp; People lost everything they owned, twice.</p>



<p>Our infrastructure law upgrades stormwater management systems and builds new transmission lines and towers so fewer will be flooded out of their homes or lose power days and weeks because of these storms.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There’s so much more in this law.&nbsp; I’m not going to bore you with the rest of it.&nbsp; But it’s &#8212; it’s significant.</p>



<p>Look, we’ve made a lot of progress, and we have an incredible opportunity ahead of us.&nbsp; But we know what families are still struggling with higher prices.&nbsp; I grew up in a family where the price of gasoline went up at the pump, it was a discussion at the kitchen table.&nbsp; Because my dad &#8212; he was a good man, made a decent living, but always on the margins.&nbsp; Everything mattered.</p>



<p>So let’s be absolutely clear about why we have such high prices now.&nbsp; There are two reasons.&nbsp; First was COVID.</p>



<p>The way the global economy works: If a factory in Vietnam makes computer chips and shuts down in Vietnam because of a COVID outbreak, it causes a ripple effect to slow down manufacturing in Detroit where they need those &#8212; those semiconductors to build the automobiles.</p>



<p>So because of the pandemic, we had disruptions in our supply of important materials, so prices went up.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I said, just look at automobiles.&nbsp; Last year alone, they accounted for one third of all the inflation in America because the price went up, because so fewer &#8212; fewer were being made.&nbsp; Automobile companies couldn’t get the computer chips, and the price of automobiles skyrocketed.</p>



<p>So I’m calling on Congress to pass the bipartisan Innovation Bill to make more of these chips here at home and speed the supply.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Intel came to see me &#8212; the chairman of the board of Intel.&nbsp; He said, “I want to be able to invest $20 billion to build a computer chip factories in &#8212; just west of Cleveland.”<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If, in fact, we get this other piece of legislation, which is in &#8212; passed one House and not the other, we’re going to &#8212; he’s going to invest another $100 billion &#8212; $100 billion.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You know what the average job of &#8212; over 7,000 construction jobs and 3,800 full-time jobs.&nbsp; Average salary of the full-time jobs &#8212; and there &#8212; many of them are blue-collar jobs &#8212; are $126,000 a year.&nbsp; Things are changing.</p>



<p>And the second big reason for inflation is Vladimir Putin.&nbsp; Not a joke.&nbsp; Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has driven up gas prices and food prices all over the world.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two major breadbaskets of wheat in the world were Ukraine and Russia.&nbsp; The United States is number three and Canada number four.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, we saw the most recent inflation data.&nbsp; Last month, about 70 percent of the increase in inflation was a consequence of Putin’s price hike because of the impact on gas and energy prices.</p>



<p>I’m doing everything I can to bring down the price to address Putin’s price hike.&nbsp; That’s why I authorized the release of 1 million barrels per day for the next six months for our st- &#8212; from our Strategic Petroleum Reserve.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I know the press is always asking me, with good reason, why I’m always on the phone talking with other world leaders, trying to keep them organized.&nbsp; Well, one of the things I did &#8212; I went out and got a lot of other countries to agree that they would release petroleum from their oil reserves.</p>



<p>So, we worked with the U.S. oil producers to ramp up the production &#8212; (applause) &#8212; and we coordinated this release with partners and allies around the world.&nbsp; And shortly after I made the announcement, another 30 countries agreed to 60 million additional barrels a day on the market.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So now we have 240 million barrels a day for the next six months.&nbsp; That’s the largest collective reserve release in history.&nbsp; Nations coming together to help deny Putin the ability to weaponize his energy resources against American families and families in Europe and around the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But there’s more that needs to be done.&nbsp; And Americans should already be seeing the savings.&nbsp; Although it’s only gone down about 18 cents, the savings are starting.</p>



<p>Beyond gas prices, I’ve called on Congress to move immediately to lower the cost of family utility bills, prescription drug bills, and more, while lowering the deficit and reducing inflation.&nbsp; That would make a big difference for families.&nbsp; We can do a lot of these things without raising a single penny on taxes of anyone making less than $400,000 a year.&nbsp; Nobody making less than $400,000 will see a single penny in their taxes raised.</p>



<p>It’s the best way Congress can address inflation right now.</p>



<p>And, folks, look, the fact is that we are in a situation where the war in Ukraine is going to continue to take its toll on the world economy.&nbsp; It’s going to take its toll on energy, and it’s going to take its toll relative to food.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When I was running for office &#8212; you heard it a thousand times from me: that we&#8217;re going to build an economy around you.&nbsp; I&#8217;m so tired of trickle-down economics.&nbsp; And I never found that trickle down on top of my head very much.&nbsp; I was listed &#8212; I was &#8212; had the great pleasure of being listed as the poorest man in Congress for 36 years.&nbsp; I still had &#8212; making a hell of a lot more money than anybody else because I was getting a senator’s salary.&nbsp; No kidding.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t think you should make money while you&#8217;re in office.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But, at any rate, the point of it is this: An awful lot of people are hurting.&nbsp; It makes a big difference.&nbsp; It makes a big difference.&nbsp; The cost of a dozen eggs, the cost of a gallon of gasoline, it matters.&nbsp; It matters.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So I concluded, when I ran this last time, that we&#8217;re going to build this economy from the bottom up and the middle out, because when that happens, everybody does well.&nbsp; The wealthy do very well and the poor have a ladder up, and the middle class has a little bit of breathing room.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I grew up in a household where we lived in a split-level home &#8212; three bedrooms, four kids, mom and dad, and a grandpop who lived with us.&nbsp; And I remember one night, you could &#8212; you know, the walls were kind of thin.&nbsp; I can &#8212; my dad was restless.&nbsp; The next morning, when he went to work, I asked mom what was the problem.&nbsp; She said, “He just noticed his company just said no more &#8212; they’re not going to &#8212; not going to cover health insurance anymore.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>It matters.&nbsp; These things matter to people.&nbsp; They matter to ordinary people.</p>



<p>We can, in fact, provide for anyone who has Type 1 diabetes or a child &#8212; or 200 million &#8212; 200,000 kids who have it.&nbsp; They need that insulin every single day.&nbsp; Average cost is six hundred and forty-seven thou- &#8212; $647 a month, sometimes as low as $90 and as high as $1,000, depending on where you are.</p>



<p>You know how mu- &#8212; made &#8212; how much it costs to make one of those vials of insulin? &nbsp;Ten &#8212; T-E-N &#8212; dollars.&nbsp; Not a single change has been made in that insulin since it was first discovered.</p>



<p>And so, we could set that price at maximum of $35.&nbsp; They still make a significant profit.&nbsp; And what they &#8212; what in God&#8217;s name are we doing?</p>



<p>Look, I&#8217;m a capitalist.&nbsp; I think people should be able to go out and make millions of dollars, even a billion if you can make it, but at least pay your fair share.&nbsp; Pay something.&nbsp; (Applause.) &nbsp;Pay something.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By the way, I&#8217;m being deadly earnest.&nbsp; You know, it&#8217;s just &#8212; you know, there are &#8212; I come from the corporate capital of the world, Delaware.&nbsp; More corporations are incorporated in the state of Delaware than every other state in the nation combined &#8212; combined.&nbsp; And I survived winning seven Senate elections in that state.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But here’s the deal: The fact is, folks, that, you know, there are 50 Fortune &#8212; there are 50 of the top 500 corporations in America last year that made a total of $40 billion in profit.&nbsp; They didn&#8217;t pay one single penny &#8212; not one.&nbsp; The average percent that billionaires pay of the 790 of them is about 3.8 percent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just pay your fair share.&nbsp; We can do all these things.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, by the way, one last thing: You know, the budget I submitted &#8212; my first budget that passed and became law, it cut the federal deficit by $350 billion.&nbsp; We cut the deficit $350 billion.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>And the budget I proposed this year, if it comes to total fruition, it will cut the deficit by one trillion three hundred billion dollars.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>So when my Republican friends start talking about “big spenders” and the reason why there&#8217;s inflation, take a look. Take a look.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve cut the deficit drastically.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, look, we&#8217;re making progress.&nbsp; Over the course of my presidency, our recovery so far has created 7.9 million new jobs &#8212; (applause) &#8212; more jobs &#8212; more jobs created over the first 14 months than any President ever.&nbsp; Over 420,000 manufacturing jobs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unemployment rate is at 3.6 percent, down from 6.4 percent.  In the state of New Hampshire, you&#8217;re down from &#8212; I think it&#8217;s 4.2 percent to 3.2 [sic] percent.</p>



<p>Folks, in Maine you&#8217;ve added 28,000 jobs, and unemployment has dropped from 4.4 to 3.6.&nbsp;</p>



<p>New Hampshire, 26,000 new jobs.&nbsp; Dropped from 4.2 &#8212; I was &#8212; misspoke &#8212; to 2.5 &#8212; 2.5 percent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last year, as I said, we cut the deficit by more than 350 thousa- &#8212; billion dollars.&nbsp; This year, we’re on track for $1.3 trillion in cuts.&nbsp; And look, that would be the largest debt reduction in American history.</p>



<p>And it’s particularly important now we ask ourselves: How are we going to reduce pressure on inflation?</p>



<p>Maine, New Hampshire, and America have gone on the mend. &nbsp;They’re on the &#8212; they’re not on the mend any longer; they’re on the move.&nbsp; And we’re coming to &#8212; at our challenges from a position of strength.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But I’m more optimistic about America today than I’ve ever been in my whole career, because I see the future that’s within our grasp.&nbsp; We can’t be afraid though.&nbsp; We’re the only nation on Earth, as I’ve said, that has always turned every single, solitary crisis we’ve had into an opportunity.&nbsp; And that’s exactly what we’re going to do today if we do it together.</p>



<p>It’s about being together &#8212; the United States of America.&nbsp; When we do that, there’s not a single thing we can’t do.</p>



<p>But God bless you all, and may God protect our troops.&nbsp; Thank you, thank you, thank you.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;</p>

<p>On April 18, National Security Council Indo-Pacific Coordinator Kurt Campbell and Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Daniel Kritenbrink convened a meeting in Honolulu with U.S. Navy Adm. John C. Aquilino, Commander, U.S. Indo-Pacific Command and senior officials from Australia, Japan, and New Zealand on developments in the Pacific Islands. In Honolulu, the officials reaffirmed the four countries’ enduring and shared commitment to the Pacific Islands. The United States resolved to intensify its engagement in the region to meet 21st-century challenges, from maritime security and economic development to the climate crisis and COVID-19. We will do this in ever-closer partnership with Pacific Island nations, including through a united Pacific Islands Forum; and together with like-minded countries, within and beyond the region, including in Europe. Officials from the four countries represented also shared concerns about a proposed security framework between the Solomon Islands and the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and its serious risks to a free and open Indo-Pacific. The meeting was part of regular and extensive U.S. consultations with allies and partners on the Indo-Pacific and is part of the announced senior administration travel this week to Hawaii, Fiji, Papua New Guinea, and the Solomon Islands.</p>

<p>Today, Jennifer Klein, White House Gender Policy Council Director, and Julie Chavez Rodriguez, White House Intergovernmental Affairs Director, hosted a roundtable discussion with state legislators from Missouri, Nebraska, and Oklahoma to discuss their efforts to protect access to reproductive health care, in light of a series of unconstitutional attacks on women’s reproductive rights.</p>



<p>During the meeting, state legislators reported on abortion restrictions in their states and shared steps they have taken to oppose new legislative proposals. Leaders in Oklahoma described the potential impact of recently-passed S 612, which makes providing an abortion a criminal offense in the state, with narrow exceptions. Nebraska lawmakers shared their recent success in fighting a trigger ban, which failed on the legislature floor earlier this month and would have banned abortion in the state if <em>Roe</em> were overturned. State legislators from Missouri described their efforts to oppose a number of pending restrictions. All participants underscored the devastating impact these bills would have on access to critical reproductive health care services, especially for low-income populations and those living in rural communities.</p>



<p>Senior Administration officials underscored the Administration’s support for reproductive rights and determination to protect access to health care. They thanked the legislators for their leadership in opposing and raising awareness about these dangerous bills, and made it clear that the Administration stands with them in the fight to protect reproductive health care.</p>



<p>The legislation discussed today is just a sample of the onerous and unconstitutional restrictions that have passed or are pending in states across the nation. In light of this wholesale attack on reproductive rights, Administration officials reiterated the President’s support for the constitutional right affirmed in <em>Roe v. Wade</em> and his commitment to protect women’s access to critical reproductive health care.</p>



<p>State legislators participated in today’s meeting included:</p>



<ul><li>Missouri Senator Jill Schupp</li><li>Missouri Representative Emily Weber</li><li>Nebraska Senator Machaela Cavanaugh</li><li>Nebraska Senator Adam Morfeld</li><li>Oklahoma House Minority Leader Emily Virgin</li><li>Oklahoma Representative Forrest Bennett</li><li>Oklahoma Representative Ajay Pittman</li></ul>

<p><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/29/fact-sheet-strategy-to-address-the-root-causes-of-migration-in-central-america/">Vice President Harris has led the Root Causes Strategy</a>, which aligns U.S. Government efforts to address the economic, governance, and security drivers of irregular migration from Central America.&nbsp; The Biden-Harris Administration’s comprehensive strategy combines significant U.S. Government resources with substantial private sector investments to support the long-term development of the region.&nbsp; To advance the strategy, the Vice President met with regional leaders and traveled to <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/07/fact-sheet-u-s-guatemala-cooperation/">Guatemala</a>, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/11/18/remarks-by-vice-president-harris-and-president-lopez-obrador-of-mexico-before-bilateral-meeting/">Mexico</a>, and <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/01/27/readout-of-vice-president-harriss-meeting-with-president-castro-of-honduras/">Honduras</a> to launch new initiatives that sustainably address the root causes of migration.&nbsp; The Vice President also brought together private sector leaders through her <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/12/13/vice-president-kamala-harris-announces-new-commitments-as-part-of-the-call-to-action-for-the-private-sector-to-deepen-investment-in-central-america-now-totaling-over-1-2-billion/#:~:text=The%20Call%20to%20Action's%20six,development%3B%20and%20public%20health%20access."><em>Call to Action</em></a> initiative that has generated more than $1.2 billion in commitments to create new jobs and opportunities for people in the region.&nbsp; In addition, she has engaged partners around the world to generate new commitments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These are long-term efforts, but under the Vice President’s leadership, the Biden-Harris Administration is seeing significant progress toward creating hope for people in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras that a better life can be found at home.&nbsp; Highlights to date include:</p>



<ul><li>U.S. initiatives are providing micro and small businesses access to $100 million in financing to support economic recovery in the region. &nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul><li>To combat the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. Government has delivered more than 15 million free-of-cost vaccine doses bilaterally and in partnership with COVAX to countries in northern Central America.</li></ul>



<ul><li>The U.S. Government has provided $26.4 million to El Salvador, $81.5 million to Guatemala and $57.1 million to Honduras to support the fight against COVID-19.</li></ul>



<ul><li>U.S. Government support for private sector companies helped create more than 70,000 jobs.</li></ul>



<ul><li>The U.S. Government’s $300 million <em>Centroamérica Local</em> initiative is empowering local organizations to address the drivers of irregular migration.</li></ul>
