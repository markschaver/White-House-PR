<p>I just spoke with President Zelenskyy and shared with him that my Administration is authorizing an additional $800 million in weapons, ammunition, and other security assistance to Ukraine. The Ukrainian military has used the weapons we are providing to devastating effect. As Russia prepares to intensify its attack in the Donbas region, the United States will continue to provide Ukraine with the capabilities to defend itself.<br> <br>This new package of assistance will contain many of the highly effective weapons systems we have already provided and new capabilities tailored to the wider assault we expect Russia to launch in eastern Ukraine. These new capabilities include artillery systems, artillery rounds, and armored personnel carriers. I have also approved the transfer of additional helicopters. In addition, we continue to facilitate the transfer of significant capabilities from our Allies and partners around the world. <br> <br>The steady supply of weapons the United States and its Allies and partners have provided to Ukraine has been critical in sustaining its fight against the Russian invasion. It has helped ensure that Putin failed in his initial war aims to conquer and control Ukraine. We cannot rest now. As I assured President Zelenskyy, the American people will continue to stand with the brave Ukrainian people in their fight for freedom.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Vice President Harris to Host First-Ever Meeting with Cabinet Officials on Maternal Health</em></p>



<p>On Wednesday, April 13, 2022, during Black Maternal Health Week, Vice President Kamala Harris will convene a meeting with Cabinet Secretaries and agency leaders to discuss the Administration’s whole-of-government approach to addressing maternal mortality and morbidity. The Vice President will convene leaders across the federal government – including agencies that may not have historically taken a leading role addressing the maternal health crisis.<br>&nbsp;<br>In December 2021, Vice President Harris convened the first-ever federal Maternal Health Day of Action, where she announced a historic Call to Action to improve health outcomes for parents and infants in the United States. This resulted in the Administration’s announcement of <a href="https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&amp;id=bdad8be2d8&amp;e=60572324a0">private sector</a> and <a href="https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&amp;id=dd8d87202c&amp;e=60572324a0">public sector</a> investments. Ahead of the meeting with Cabinet officials, the Administration is following up with additional actions to address maternal health, and to combat the systemic inequities that lead to worse maternal outcomes for Black, Native American, and rural women.<br>&nbsp;<br><strong><u>New Announcements:</u></strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>11 Additional States and D.C. Ask to Extend Medicaid and CHIP Coverage to a Full Year After Pregnancy under American Rescue Plan: </strong>The American Rescue Plan is working to make Medicaid and CHIP coverage for 12 months after pregnancy a reality for people across the country.&nbsp;The Vice President called on states to expand their postpartum coverage during her Call to Action in December.<ul><li>The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) has approved Louisiana, Virginia, New Jersey, and Illinois’ extension of Medicaid and CHIP coverage for 12 months after pregnancy on or before April 1, 2022. CMS is also working with another eleven states and the District of Columbia to extend postpartum coverage for a full year after pregnancy, including: California, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Oregon, New Mexico, South Carolina, Tennessee, and West Virginia.&nbsp; In addition, a number of other states have announced that they are working to extend Medicaid and CHIP coverage to 12 months after pregnancy, and CMS looks forward to working with those states.</li><li>In order to receive federal funds and to ensure consistency with federal standards, including those set by the American Rescue Plan, states must go through a formal process run by CMS. Medicaid covers more than 40 percent of births in the United States, and extending this coverage will bring the peace of mind of health coverage to parents and children during the vulnerable post-partum period.&nbsp;</li><li>Based on HHS estimates, approximately 720,000 people would benefit if all states were to adopt the American Rescue Plan’s new option to extend post-partum Medicaid and CHIP coverage for a full 12 months.</li></ul></li><li><strong>“Birthing-Friendly” Hospital Designation: </strong>CMS is proposing the “Birthing-Friendly” hospital designation to drive improvements in maternal health outcomes and maternal health equity. The “Birthing-Friendly” hospital designation would assist consumers in choosing hospitals that have demonstrated a commitment to maternal health. The Administration announced this new designation during the White House Maternal Health Day of Action Summit.<ul><li>Initially, the designation would be awarded to hospitals based on attestation that the hospital has participated in maternity care quality improvement collaboratives and implemented best practices that advance health care quality, safety, and equity for pregnant and post-partum patients.</li><li>Data will be submitted by hospitals for the first time in May 2022, and CMS will post data for October to December 2021 in fall 2022. Criteria for the designation may be expanded in the future.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Engaging the Health Care Industry to Improve Health Outcomes: </strong>In Summer 2022, CMS will convene health care industry stakeholders – including health care facilities, insurance companies, state officials and providers – to focus on industry commitments to improve health outcomes experienced by pregnant and postpartum people. CMS and experts will share best practices and commitments and request that health care industry leaders make commitments to advance maternal health.</li><li><strong>Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting (MIECHV) Programs:</strong> The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), through the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), announced approximately $16 million to strengthen Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting (MIECHV) Programs through seven awards supporting eight states.<ul><li>These awards will advance data and technology innovations to support positive maternal and child health outcomes in states and communities, and focus on addressing health disparities.</li></ul></li><li><strong>State Maternal Health Innovation and Implementation (State MHI) Program:</strong> State MHI supports state-level development and implementation of proven strategies to improve maternal health and address maternal health disparities. The new funding, $9 million, will continue to build state capacity to deliver high-quality maternity care services and provide training for maternal care clinicians. It also adds a component to enhance the quality of state-level maternal health data through better collection, reporting and analysis.&nbsp;The program will fund up to nine cooperative agreements, and each will receive up to $1 million over five years.</li><li><strong>Maternal Health Best Practices: </strong>HHS, through the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), is also, on telehealth.hhs.gov, posting a new Maternal Health Best Practice Guide for providers to incorporate telehealth for prenatal and postpartum care, and monitoring within high-risk pregnancy. Through remote patient monitoring, screening and treatment for postpartum depression, and lactation consulting, maternal telehealth can help reduce barriers to access to critical care for mothers before, during and after a pregnancy.</li></ul>



<p><strong><u>Previous Actions Announced since the Vice President’s Call to Action in December</u></strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>Investing in Doulas:</strong> HHS <a href="https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&amp;id=4a82af5246&amp;e=60572324a0">announced</a> the availability of $4.5 million for hiring, training, certifying, and compensating community-based doulas in areas with high rates of adverse maternal and infant health outcomes, doubling the number of Healthy Start doula programs nationwide.</li><li><strong>Title X</strong>: HHS <a href="https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&amp;id=014e3bb105&amp;e=60572324a0">restored</a> access to Title X family planning services nationwide to fill service gaps caused by more than a quarter of Title X providers withdrawing from the program over the past two and a half years in response to the previous administration’s Title X rule. HHS awarded $256.6 million in grant funding to support 76 grantees to deliver equitable, affordable, client-centered, and high-quality family planning services.</li><li><strong>FY23 Budget Request</strong>: The President’s budget includes $470  million to: reduce maternal mortality and morbidity rates; expand maternal health initiatives in rural communities; implement implicit bias training for healthcare providers; create pregnancy medical home demonstration projects; and address the highest rates of perinatal health disparities, including by supporting the perinatal health workforce.</li></ul>



<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Additional Background</span></strong></p>



<ul><li>As Vice President, Kamala Harris has worked closely with President Biden and other leaders in the Administration to improve outcomes for Black women and their families.<ul><li>The White House released a Presidential Proclamation to mark Black Maternal Health Week in <a href="https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&amp;id=1dc908d34d&amp;e=60572324a0">2021</a> and <a href="https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&amp;id=ce11247eb4&amp;e=60572324a0">2022</a>.</li><li>In December 2021, the Vice President led a <a href="https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&amp;id=eb284fc1e0&amp;e=60572324a0">Maternal Health Day of Action Summit</a>, noting the urgent need to address this crisis.<ul><li>At the Summit, the Vice President <a href="https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&amp;id=9726cc666b&amp;e=60572324a0">announced</a> guidance to help states provide 12 months of continuous postpartum coverage through their Medicaid programs, up from 60 days; a new HHS report showing the impact of state extensions of Medicaid postpartum coverage to 12 months; and CMS’s plan to propose the establishment of a “Birthing-Friendly” hospital designation. She also <a href="https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&amp;id=a49560e7f1&amp;e=60572324a0">announced</a>&nbsp;that more than 20 companies and nonprofits have pledged to invest over $150 million and take other critical actions to address the maternal health crisis.</li></ul></li><li>In April 2021, the Vice President hosted a roundtable on Black Maternal Health with Domestic Policy Advisor Ambassador Susan Rice.

<p>Dear Madam Speaker: (Dear Madam President:)</p>



<p>Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1662(d)) provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, within 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President publishes in the <em>Federal Register </em>and transmits to the Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the anniversary date. &nbsp;In accordance with this provision, I have sent to the <em>Federal Register</em> for publication the enclosed notice stating that the national emergency with respect to specified harmful foreign activities of the Government of the Russian Federation declared in Executive Order 14024 of April 15, 2021, which was expanded in scope in Executive Order 14066 of March 8, 2022, and with respect to which additional steps were taken in Executive Order 14039 of August 20, 2021, Executive Order 14068 of March 11, 2022, and Executive Order 14071 of April 6, 2022, is to continue in effect beyond April 15, 2022.</p>



<p>Specified harmful foreign activities of the Government of the Russian Federation &#8212; in particular, efforts to undermine the conduct of free and fair democratic elections and democratic institutions in the United States and its allies and partners; to engage in and facilitate malicious cyber-enabled activities against the United States and its allies and partners; to foster and use transnational corruption to influence foreign governments; to pursue extraterritorial activities targeting dissidents or journalists; to undermine security in countries and regions important to United States national security; and to violate well-established principles of international law, including respect for the territorial integrity of states &#8212; continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United&nbsp;States. &nbsp;Therefore, I have determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency declared in Executive Order 14024 with respect to specified harmful foreign activities of the Government of the Russian Federation.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-right">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sincerely,</p>

<p>Governor Abbott’s unnecessary and redundant inspections of trucks transiting ports of entry between Texas and Mexico are causing significant disruptions to the food and automobile supply chains, delaying manufacturing, impacting jobs, and raising prices for families in Texas and across the country. Local businesses and trade associations are calling on Governor Abbott to reverse this decision because trucks are facing lengthy delays exceeding 5 hours at some border crossings and commercial traffic has dropped by as much as 60 percent.  The continuous flow of legitimate trade and travel and CBP’s ability to do its job should not be obstructed. Governor Abbott’s actions are impacting people’s jobs, and the livelihoods of hardworking American families. </p>

<p>National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan spoke today with President Maia Sandu of Moldova. Mr. Sullivan expressed appreciation for Moldova’s generosity in welcoming individuals fleeing Russian aggression in neighboring Ukraine. He underscored the U.S. commitment to help Moldova and the region manage the effects of Russia’s brutal war, including $100 million announced earlier this month to help Moldova meet the needs of refugees as well as additional financial assistance to multilateral institutions supporting Moldova. He expressed strong support for President Sandu’s efforts to build a more democratic and prosperous county. He thanked her for sharing Moldova’s experience countering corruption at last year’s Summit for Democracy and noted continued U.S. support for these reform efforts, including through the recently announced European Democratic Resilience Initiative.

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Sheet Metal Workers Local 19 JATC<br><em>Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</em></em></p>



<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Good afternoon.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Good afternoon, everyone.&nbsp; Good afternoon.&nbsp; Can we please give it up for William?&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br><br>You know, I was &#8212; I was backstage listening to you, William.&nbsp; And when I listened to you &#8212; we had a minute to talk earlier &#8212; and I know that you represent the future of the American labor movement.&nbsp; And in that movement, we are strong.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Well, good afternoon, Philadelphia.&nbsp; It’s good to be back.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; It’s good to be back, and it’s good to be here at the Sheet Metal Workers Local 19.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; I love being in the house of labor.&nbsp;<br><br>And I will tell you &#8212; I think we all know, William had it exactly right &#8212; being here &#8212; Marty Walsh talked about it &#8212; being here &#8212; well, it’s being with family.&nbsp; It feels like being with family because it is being with family.&nbsp;<br><br>I want to recognize and thank my friend, Liz Shuler, the President of the AFL-CIO, who traveled down with me on Air Force Two.&nbsp; As you all know well, Liz is a fighter.&nbsp; She goes to work<br>every day for the working people of our nation, and she is an essential partner to our administration.<br><br>I know Joe Sellers is here because we were hanging out earlier &#8212; I want to thank him &#8212; the General President of the Sheet Metal Workers International, who got his start right here at Local 19.<br><br>And I know Sean O&#8217;Brien is here, the new General President of the Teamsters.&nbsp;<br><br>Thank you each for your tremendous leadership.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>Also here with us here are a number of elected officials &#8212; true champions of the labor movement, people I have worked with for years &#8212; leaders like Senator Bob Casey.&nbsp; Thank you, Bob, always.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Congresswoman Mary Gay Scanlon.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; There she is.&nbsp; And Congressman Dwight Evans.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>I want to thank you, Governor, for the warm welcome at the tarmac this morning when I arrived.&nbsp; And thank you for your work.<br><br>And, Mayor Jim Kenney, thank you as well.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>And, of course, joining us today, a great, great leader &#8212; before he had the title of “Secretary,” because he’s just been a leader in every position he’s had &#8212; but our Secretary of Labor, Mahrty &#8212; Marty &#8212; (laughter) &#8212; Marty Walsh.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; (Laughs.)<br><br>SECRETARY WALSH:&nbsp; (Inaudible.)&nbsp;<br><br>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Mahty!<br><br>You know, over the past year, Secretary Walsh and I have been traveling the country.&nbsp; We’ve been visiting job sites and training facilities and union halls.&nbsp;<br><br>And we’ve actually been on a bit of a traveling roadshow, I should say.&nbsp; And I couldn’t tell you &#8212; I’ve seen Secretary Walsh &#8212; I heard him say this earlier &#8212; but I’ve seen you, Secretary, when the cameras are on, when the sec- &#8212; when the cameras are off.&nbsp; And you are always fighting for the working people of our nation.&nbsp; I thank you for that.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>And some of you may have met the Secretary for the first time, but you probably know from hearing him speak: Secretary Walsh &#8212; he grew up in a union household, in a family and in a community that believed in the power of solidarity.<br><br>And, you know, he and I get on quite well.&nbsp; We really do enjoy each other’s company.&nbsp; We’ve developed a real friendship.&nbsp; And, you know, some people might look at us and say, “Well, what could they possibly have in common?”&nbsp;<br><br>You know, I grew up on the other side of the country.&nbsp; But I was raised &#8212; and he and I were raised with the same values.<br><br>My parents met while they were marching for civil rights.&nbsp; They taught me that people can make a difference and that when we use our collective voice, whether at a protest or a picket line, we can drive great change.<br><br>And that belief in the power of solidarity has guided me, him, and all of us our entire lives.&nbsp; And it guides our administration.<br><br>President Joe Biden and I are determined to lead the most pro-union administration in America’s history.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>Because you see, we are clear and we know, each and every day in ways big and small, unions change lives.&nbsp; Unions negotiate better wages and safer working conditions for millions of workers around our country.&nbsp;<br><br>And let’s be clear: Even if you are not a member of a union, you thank unions for every benefit that you receive.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Thank unions for the five-day workweek, for the weekend, for sick leave.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We should all &#8212; anyone who works in America &#8212; know that you have benefited from the hard work, from the fight of the leaders in this movement.&nbsp; Our labor leaders, our unions train people to take on good jobs.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But as you have heard, it’s so much more than a training of a skill.&nbsp; It provides community.&nbsp; It provides home.&nbsp; It provides a place that remembers that nobody should be made to fight alone.&nbsp; It is so fundamental in terms of the approach, which says that we all know we are stronger when we stand together.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; That is at the heart of the spirit behind this movement.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unions create stronger communities.&nbsp; They bring people together.&nbsp; And they, of course, protect workers from things like harassment and discrimination.&nbsp; And they give workers a voice.&nbsp; Put simply, unions move our nation forward.&nbsp; And the American people know it.&nbsp; The American people know that when unions win, workers win, families win, communities win.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; When unions win, America wins &#8212; (applause) &#8212; as evidenced by the fact that, today, unions have their highest approval rating since 1965.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br><br>People know what we’re talking about.&nbsp; They know what we’re talking about.&nbsp; They know, today, as a matter of fact, about half of all non-union workers say they would join a union if given a chance.&nbsp; That is almost 60 million people in our country, nearly 20 percent of our nation.&nbsp; Think about it.&nbsp; Think about it.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then that, of course, has to prompt the question: “Well, what’s stopping them?”&nbsp; And we know that part of the answer &#8212; a big part of the answer is that, for decades, powerful forces in our country have been hard at work building barriers to stop workers from organizing.&nbsp; And we all know that we’ve got to then take it on with a powerful counterforce, which is why our administration is working even harder to tear those barriers down.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Secretary Walsh mentioned, as partners, he and I lead the White House Task Force on Worker Organizing and Empowerment.&nbsp; Last year, our task force proposed nearly 70 actions the executive branch of our government can take to protect and expand the rights of workers to organize and collectively bargain.&nbsp; And the President &#8212; our President, Joe Biden &#8212; accepted every single one.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last year, as everyone here knows, we also made an historic investment in our nation’s infrastructure.&nbsp; With your help, we passed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.<br><br>It will put thousands of union workers, carpenters, and pipefitters, and plumbers, and, yes, sheet metal workers,<br>to work across the country.<br><br>In fact, last week, I met &#8212; in my office in D.C., I met with some longtime friends from the California Building Trades.&nbsp; And one of the leaders told me there that thanks to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, workers will soon be upgrading &#8212; not only in California, but around the country &#8212; for example, the H-VAC systems in local schools.&nbsp; Well, let’s think about what that means.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>As the pandemic &#8212; it, of course, only highlighted the importance of clean air in our schools where our babies, where the children of our nation go to get an education, to reach their God-given capacity.&nbsp; And we know then the connection between these issues because we know that when students breathe clean air, they are healthier, they concentrate better, they learn more.&nbsp; Well, who’s going to do the job of help making that possible?&nbsp; These folks.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>So, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, it invests billions of dollars in our nation&#8217;s schools so that we make it safer for our children.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All these issues are connected.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And we are fighting not only to create jobs, but to protect our workers.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, as has been mentioned and Liz talked about it, summer, of course, is coming.&nbsp; And the late &#8212; the last, actually, eight years, you all might know, have been the hottest on record.&nbsp; The last eight years have been the hottest on record.&nbsp; And many of the jobs that the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law created will require workers to work outdoors, outside, to build back up our nation’s infrastructure.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And that means, during the summer months in particular, they will be working outside in the heat, building bridges, replacing lead pipes, laying broadband wire so that our students can have the benefit of being able to have that resource, knowing that, unlike for some of us, the thing of Encyclopedia Britannica is a thing of a long time ago &#8212; (laughter) &#8212; and now the kids need to be online to help get their homework done.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Broadband wire &#8212; why do we care about that?&nbsp; We’re going to lay it across the country because we know that our seniors might need the benefit of telemedicine if it’s too far to get to a hospital.&nbsp; Our small business owners need access to high-speed broadband to run those small businesses that are part of what fuels America’s economy.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But all that work, so much of it will be done by highly skilled workers outside.&nbsp; So it’s a real issue.<br><br>And then, there are other jobs created by the Infrastructure Law that will require workers to be indoors &#8212;<br>in steel mills and on factory floors &#8212; where temperatures can climb high enough to give workers heatstroke.<br><br>And as many of you know then, this high heat is dangerous and can be dangerous when it is there, in their workplace &#8212; even deadly.<br><br>And every year, thousands of workers suffer heat-related<br>injury and illnesses.&nbsp; The danger posed by extreme heat has been ignored and overlooked for far too long.&nbsp; And that danger is only increasing.<br><br>Because as we know, climate change has become a climate crisis.&nbsp; By 2030, this very city can expect 25 days a year with heat and humidity that will make it feel like 105 degrees or hotter.&nbsp; Think about that.<br><br>So, let’s be clear: Heat is a workplace safety issue.&nbsp; It turns out outdoor heat, indoor heat presents a workplace safety issue.&nbsp; And employers are responsible for protecting their workers in the workplace from the dangers of heat, including<br>in farm fields, in delivery vans, and in nursing homes &#8212; (applause) &#8212; everywhere that has workers.<br><br>So, our administration is fighting to make sure<br>every workplace is protected.<br><br>Now, I’m making an obvious point clear.&nbsp; Some people who don’t understand need to understand that the workplace to get the jobs done that’ll make life easier for most people in our country, that workplace is not necessarily an office with air conditioning.&nbsp; But it is a workplace nonetheless where highly skilled workers work.&nbsp; And that is how we are approaching this issue.&nbsp;<br><br>In fact, I know you heard, when I served in the United States Senate with Bob Casey, I introduced a bill to create a federal heat standard to protect workers.&nbsp; We named it after a farmworker who lost his life after picking grapes for 10 hours in 105-degree heat.<br><br>And I’m proud that last fall, OSHA &#8212; the Occupational Safety and Health Administration &#8212; took the first step toward creating such a standard.&nbsp; But we cannot wait for that rule to be finalized to protect our workers.<br><br>So, today, OSHA is initiating what’s named a National Emphasis Program on heat.&nbsp; And for the first time, OSHA will begin &#8212; for the first time, OSHA will begin nationwide workplace heat inspections &#8212; (applause) &#8212; targeting over 70 high-risk industries.&nbsp;<br><br>Because we’re going to put these values in place.&nbsp; We’re going to put these rules in place.&nbsp; And we’re going to monitor to make sure that the workers aren’t out there without us making sure that they are receiving all of the protections that they are entitled to receive.&nbsp; And we’re not going to stop there.&nbsp;<br><br>As all of you know, it is not how you start a job; it is how you finish it.&nbsp; And so our administration is going to continue this fight until every worker is protected, by using every tool at our disposal to mitigate the danger posed by extreme heat.<br><br>Philadelphia: For myself, for President Biden, and I know for so many of you, this is what it all comes down to &#8212; dignity.&nbsp; The dignity of work.&nbsp; Understanding all work requires a skill.&nbsp; And this work is highly skilled.&nbsp; And it is critical that if we are to strengthen ourselves as a nation, we must strengthen the rights of workers and we must collectively recognize their value and the dignity of that work.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br><br>Every worker deserves a safe and a healthy workplace.&nbsp; Every worker deserves a job with good wages and fair benefits.&nbsp; Every worker in America deserves the choice to join a union.&nbsp; And the President and I will always stand with you to defend these sacred principles.&nbsp;<br><br>Our administration will do everything in our power to ensure the workers of our nation can succeed and&nbsp;can thrive.&nbsp; Because when workers succeed and thrive, so does our nation.&nbsp;<br><br>I thank you all very much.&nbsp; And please take care.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; END</p>
