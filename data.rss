<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong><em>Maintaining the momentum for pandemic response and Prioritizing Preparedness</em></strong></p>



<p>On May 12, under the leadership of the United States, Belize, Germany, Indonesia, and Senegal, global leaders from across the world’s economies, civil society, and the private sector gathered for the 2<sup>nd</sup> Global COVID-19 Summit.&nbsp; Summit participants made major new policy and financial commitments to make vaccines available to those at highest risk, to expand access to tests and treatments, and to prevent future health crises.&nbsp; These are linked here.&nbsp; Success in these areas is achievable, but it is not inevitable; leaders reinforced the value of whole-of-government and whole-of-society approaches to bring the acute phase of COVID-19 to an end, and the importance of being &nbsp;prepared for future pandemic threats. The Summit was focused on preventing complacency, recognizing the pandemic is not over; protecting the most vulnerable, including the elderly, immunocompromised people, and frontline and health workers; and preventing future health crises, recognizing <em>now </em>is the time to secure political and financial commitment for pandemic preparedness.</p>



<p>The Summit catalyzed bold commitments.&nbsp; Financially, leaders committed to provide nearly $2 billion in new funding – additional to pledges made earlier in 2022.&nbsp; These funds will accelerate access to vaccinations, testing, and treatments, and they will contribute to a new pandemic preparedness and global health security fund housed at the World Bank.&nbsp; Leaders also made robust national commitments to expand and accelerate vaccine coverage, in particular for their at-risk populations; to expand access to testing and treatments; to protect and support the health workforce and increase domestic budgets for health systems strengthening; and to advance health security, including through the new fund.&nbsp;</p>



<p>World leaders identified three major Summit outcomes.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Prioritizing the highest risk populations to save lives.&nbsp; </strong>First, great progress has been made in fighting COVID-19, but the pandemic is not over and the next health crisis can strike at any time – likely while the world is still battling COVID-19.&nbsp; Summit participants committed to double down on their collective efforts to control COVID-19, and we will enhance our focus on the highest risk populations, including the elderly, the immunocompromised, and healthcare and frontline workers – so that SARS-CoV-2 becomes a manageable respiratory pathogen everywhere.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Expanding access to countermeasures– for COVID-19 and future threats. </strong>Second, the pandemic has led to major advances in developing and delivering life-saving vaccines, tests, treatments, personal protective equipment, and other supplies.&nbsp; Participants especially expressed support for the ACT-Accelerator, as the multilateral mechanism deploying these needed supplies. And yet, the pandemic also underscored major longstanding inequities in access to new countermeasures, especially for low- and lower middle-income countries.&nbsp; Summit participants committed to finding sustainable and predictable solutions for early warning systems and to developing a cohesive global roadmap for local and regional access to medical countermeasures, personal protective equipment, and other lifesaving supplies for potentially pandemic diseases, as well as expanding access to manufacturing and research, including the concept of regional hubs for pandemic preparedness and response around the world.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Maintaining the momentum for pandemic response and prioritizing preparedness.&nbsp; </strong>Finally, no country was fully prepared for the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp; As a result, over 6 million people around the world have lost their lives, trillions of dollars have been lost from the global economy, and gains in global health and towards the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have been reversed.&nbsp; Summit participants committed to maintain the political will needed to establish national, regional, and global capacity for health security and pandemic prevention, preparedness, and response, including for training a strong network of experts to ensure readiness for future outbreaks with pandemic potential.&nbsp; They supported the efforts of the G20 and other partners to establish a pandemic preparedness and global health security fund housed at the World Bank, working in close cooperation with WHO, and they committed to support locally-led solutions to expand and protect the health workforce and minimize disruptions to routine and essential health services.</li></ul>



<p><strong><em><u>Vaccinate the World: </u></em></strong><strong><u>Getting Vaccines to the Most Vulnerable</u></strong></p>



<p>Many countries have made great strides toward meeting the 70% global vaccination target set by the World Health Organization. Since the first Summit, the world’s vaccination rate has increased from 33% to nearly 60%, and lower-middle income countries have risen from 13% to over 50%.&nbsp; However, low income countries are struggling, and our strategy must continue to evolve with the virus.&nbsp; The global effort must focus on populations at highest risk of hospitalization and mortality, including the elderly, immunocompromised people, and healthcare and other frontline workers.&nbsp; World leaders must take action, now, to build, coordinate, and finance the national, regional, and global systems and expert networks required to control COVID-19 so that it becomes a manageable respiratory illness – including predictable and equitable access to safe and effective pandemic vaccines for all countries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ten leaders from government and civil society joined this session, which was co-hosted by <strong>His Excellency Abdoulaye Diouf Sarr</strong>, Minister of Health and Social Action, Senegal; <strong>Her Excellency Annalena Baerbock, </strong>Foreign Minister of Germany; and <strong>Her Excellency Samantha Power</strong>, Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development. The speakers re-emphasized the value of safe and effective vaccines for bringing the acute phase of COVID-19 to an end.&nbsp; The speakers discussed new commitments, challenges, and solutions for building the national, regional, and global systems needed to get vaccines to health and frontline workers, the elderly and immunocompromised, and in humanitarian settings.&nbsp; In particular, they discussed new policy commitments to help overcome local barriers to vaccine access and uptake, as well as financial commitments to expand and sustain access, country by country, everywhere in the world.&nbsp; They also discussed commitments to developing, financing, and sustaining systems for producing and supplying vaccines for COVID-19 variants and future health emergencies, including national and regional access to vaccines and predictable access, scaling, and surge supply.&nbsp; Leaders highlighted the need for robust and sustained donor attention to vaccine administration for COVID-19 &nbsp;and a more coordinated, country-by-country approach to getting vaccinations to those most at risk in communities.&nbsp; They also called for [and committed to] developing a cohesive roadmap for local and regional access to vaccines for future variants and pandemics.&nbsp; The session also highlighted bold commitments from governments to get boosters to their populations, launch vaccination campaigns to reach high risk populations and children, and to accelerate vaccination coverage in their domestic populations. Non-governmental leaders also pledged to work toward sustained access to vaccine availability, as well as plans to scale up and provide open-source results of research and development to inform COVID-19 vaccination strategies in low- and lower-middle income countries, including on boosters and mix-and-match vaccination strategies.</p>



<p><strong><em><u>Save Lives Now: </u></em></strong><strong><u>Expanding Access to Tests and Treatments</u></strong><strong><u></u></strong></p>



<p>Ending the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic and ensuring that COVID-19 becomes a treatable respiratory disease will require enhancing predictable and equitable access to rapid testing and to lifesaving treatments.&nbsp; While the COVID-19 pandemic has catalyzed great advances in diagnostic testing and new therapeutics, such as oral antivirals, there is not yet a sustainable supply of these lifesaving interventions nor a sustainable system for targeting these interventions to those facing the highest risk of hospitalization and mortality, including the elderly, immunocompromised people, as well as healthcare and other frontline workers.&nbsp; In addition, access to and provision of oxygen needs to be increased. &nbsp;Moreover, testing and diagnostics is crucial to enable genetic sequencing and to monitor the emergence of new virus variants. This means that world leaders must take actions, now, to solve persistent challenges in the sustainable and scaled production, delivery, and market demand for tests and treatments, by incentivizing market shaping commitments and advancing platforms for advanced purchases of tests and treatments; lowering production costs, facilitating manufacturing of antiviral inputs, including Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients, and developing national plans for testing and treatment.</p>



<p>Eleven leaders from government and civil society joined this session, which was co-hosted <strong>by His Excellency Kevin Bernard, </strong>Minister of Health and Wellness of Belize,and <strong>Her Excellency Svenja&nbsp;Schulze</strong>, Federal&nbsp;Minister&nbsp;for Economic&nbsp;Cooperationand&nbsp;Development of Germany.&nbsp; Speakers acknowledged the work of existing global efforts, such as ACT-Accelerator, and the importance of fully funding them, to enable the delivery of tests and treatment to people who need them. Speakers emphasized the importance of targeting testing and treatment to those at highest risk of hospitalization and death around the world.&nbsp; Specifically, they discussed the need for country strategies and financing to enhance access to molecular diagnostics and rapid tests, as well as treatments, including oral antivirals and oxygen.&nbsp; They committed to work nationally and globally to overcome local barriers and to pilot test-to-treat strategies. While progress is being made with the Medicines Patent Pool, leaders underscored the importance of long-term access and affordable pricing for affordable, safe, effective and quality medications, including antiviral medications, including the need&nbsp; for closer partnerships between producers, generic manufacturers, and regulators.</p>



<p><strong><em><u>Build Better Health Security:</u></em></strong><strong><u> Preventing Future Health Crises</u></strong><strong><u></u></strong></p>



<p>No country in the world was well-prepared for the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp; As a result, the pandemic remains an ongoing global catastrophe that has cost millions of lives, unwound decades of gains in global health and development, and decreased national and regional resilience to shocks.&nbsp; The time is now to create the national, regional, and global capacity needed to prepare for future variants and the next health emergency, which could come at any time. To reduce the world’s vulnerability to future pandemics, the WHO’s Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response and the G20’s High Level Independent Panel made a number of action-oriented recommendations in early 2021, including to establish a new Financial Intermediary Fund (FIF) for pandemic preparedness and global health security.&nbsp; This recommendation has since been amplified by the World Health Organization Director General and Indonesian G20 Presidency, as well as prominent and expert organizations and individuals from around the world.</p>



<p>Eleven leaders from government and civil society joined this session, which was co-hosted by <strong>His Excellency Budi Gunadi Sadikin, </strong>Minister of Health of Indonesia,and by <strong>His Excellency Antony Blinken</strong>, Secretary of State of the United States<strong>. </strong>This session discussed the need for country capacity, sustainable financing, and a strong health workforce to strengthen health security and health systems – for COVID-19 variants and for future health emergencies.&nbsp; Specifically, speakers discussed exciting new financial commitments and momentum, including work in support of the G20’s Finance and Health Taskforce, to establish a new pandemic preparedness and global health security financial intermediary fund at the World Bank in the next few months, in close cooperation with the WHO and other international partners.&nbsp; Speakers also called for the support of initiatives to strengthen global health governance, especially at the WHO, through amendments of the International Health Regulations and a new international instrument on pandemic prevention, preparedness, and response.</p>



<p>Speakers also emphasized new commitments to expand and protect the health workforce, including by increasing training on infection prevention and control and providing personal protective equipment. Speakers also highlighted the need for current and future policy and financial commitments to ensure that every country has the needed capacity to mitigate COVID-19 variants and future health threats and pandemics. Speakers highlighted commitments to expanding and improving laboratory capacities. Speakers also reiterated the need to generate and sustain local and regional access to medical countermeasures and personal protective equipment, including through research and development and by scaling and diversifying local and regional manufacturing globally. Leaders underscored the need to build a strong network of experts to ensure readiness for future outbreaks with pandemic potential. Discussions also highlighted the need for a robust global plan for a timely and seamless transition from ACT-A to future approaches and instruments.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Via Teleconference<br>(May 11, 2022)</p>



<p>6:06 P.M. EDT</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Good evening.&nbsp; And thank you for joining our background call previewing tomorrow&#8217;s Global COVID Summit.&nbsp; This call will be held on background, attributable to a “senior administration official.”&nbsp; And it will now be embargoed until 7:00 a.m. tomorrow, May 12th.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For your awareness, not for your reporting, the officials on this call are [senior administration official] and [senior administration official].&nbsp;</p>



<p>With that, I will pass it off to [senior administration official].  Thank you.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Welcome, everyone.&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; Thanks so much for taking the time today to join us.&nbsp; I’m &#8212; our office’s mission is to coordinate across the government to prevent, detect, and respond to pandemic and infectious disease threats that face America and the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And today, we want to brief you on the sum- &#8212; on the Global COVID Summit that the United States will cohost tomorrow.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As you know, the United States has delivered over 500 million doses of vaccines to over 100 countries as part of the 1.2 billion doses committed by the United States at the last summit in September.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The U.S. has also led the world in COVID-19 funding, committing over $19 billion in funding to date in vaccinations, tests, treatments, oxygen, and humanitarian assistance.&nbsp; And we&#8217;ve partnered with countries to improve their capacity to make their own vaccines.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This has truly been an unprecedented public health effort to save lives around the world and keep Americans safe from the next variant.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On Thursday, the United States will continue our leadership globally by cohosting the Global COVID-19 Summit with Belize, which is serving as the CARICOM chair, with Germany as the G7 presidency, with Indonesia as the G20 presidency, and Senegal as the Africa Union chair.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have made great progress since the last summit, but the pandemic is not over.&nbsp; And now is the time to continue to respond and also prepare for the next variant and the next pandemic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The overarching purpose of the summit are really twofold.&nbsp; One is to redouble our efforts to control COVID-19.&nbsp; And the second is to ensure the world is prepared for the next one &#8212; the next pandemic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We will be joined by partners from around the world, including governments, multilateral organizations, philanthropies, businesses, and civil society leaders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And there are really three priorities: &nbsp;</p>



<p>First, we want to prevent complacency.&nbsp; The pandemic is not over.&nbsp; We have the need to continue to address new subvariants, which continue to emerge, slowing vaccinations.&nbsp; We need funding both at home and from countries and other stakeholders to get more shots into arms and other vital lifesaving resources to the world.&nbsp; So the summit will focus on securing new resources and policy commitments to control COVID in 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Second, we want to prevent deaths, and that means focusing on the most vulnerable.&nbsp; Since January of 2021, when deaths were at their highest around the world and a seven-day average of 14,000 deaths a day &#8212; now they&#8217;re down to about 2,000 deaths per day.&nbsp; That is some progress that countries around the world have contributed to, health workers have contributed to, but we still have more to do.&nbsp; Two thousand deaths a day is still too many.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The summit will focus on getting vaccines, tests, and treatments to those at highest risk, like the elderly, the immunocompromised, and frontline and health &#8212; and other health workers around the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We do have the tools to control COVID &#8212; vaccines, tests, and now new antiviral medicines &#8212; but medical breakthroughs are not enough.&nbsp; We need more funds to hire vaccinators to support vaccination sites, to support fridges to store vaccines, to support fuel to &#8212; for vehicles to deliver vaccines to people out of reach.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We also need new funding to purchase new treatments and expand test and treatment strategies like we&#8217;ve done for HIV/AIDS and malaria, and like we&#8217;re doing for COVID here in America.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The third thing we want to do is to prevent future variants and pandemics.&nbsp; Delta and Omicron emerged in other parts of the world before they reached America.&nbsp; The next pathogen is also likely to emerge in another part of the world.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s not a matter of “if,” but “when.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The truth is we&#8217;ve learned we can stop outbreaks at their source by investing in the capacities of countries to carry out surveillance and detect the next variant and threat; to develop and manufacture medicines, vaccines, and test locally; and to equip local health workers, clinics, and hospitals to ensure that those lifesaving measures reach people who need them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To do that, the summit will call for countries to invest in the new Global Pandemic Preparedness and Health Security fund at the World Bank.</p>



<p>This is not a talk-the-talk summit, it&#8217;s a walk-the-walk summit.&nbsp; In advance of the summit, we&#8217;ve called on leaders of governments, civil society, businesses, and philanthropy to make significant new commitments to get shots into arms, expand access to tests and treatments, and enhance health security, and prevent future variants and pandemics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We are doing our part in this effort by securing funding to embark on responding to this pandemic, to continue to respond to it in an unprecedented fashion.&nbsp; We are doing our part by convening the world around a coordinated effort, an urgent effort to save lives.&nbsp; Other countries are doing their part by providing new resources.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the hard-fought progress we&#8217;ve made and the momentum we have is at serious risk without congressional action.&nbsp; Countries are declining our doses because they don&#8217;t have the resources they need to get shots into arms, whether they’d be fridges to store the doses or information campaigns to combat hesitancy.</p>



<p>The President, as you know, has requested $22.5 billion in emergency funding to continue our COVID response.&nbsp; That includes $5 billion that will ensure the continuation of our vital, proven work to get shots into arms globally and to expand access to therapeutics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tomorrow, you will hear a loud call from the United States for Congress to act with the urgency that this virus warrants.&nbsp; We know the virus is not waiting for Congress to act, so we need urgent, urgent action, not empty words.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I&#8217;m going to turn it now to my colleague, [senior administration official], who will give you a sense of what to expect at the summit tomorrow.&nbsp;</p>



<p>[Senior administration official], over to you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Hi, everyone.&nbsp; So what will we see tomorrow at the summit?&nbsp; First, you&#8217;ll see that countries and the private sector stepped up.&nbsp; The summit includes leaders from all over the world, as you can see from the advisory that we released yesterday.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During the summit, the U.S. will join the four cohost countries &#8212; again, those are Senegal, Germany, Indonesia, and Belize &#8212; to kick off this summit.</p>



<p>And then at least 10 world leaders and heads of state will speak, as well as at least a notable &#8212; many notable govern- &#8212;&nbsp; non-governmental speakers will speak throughout the summit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vice President Harris will also join world leaders during Thursday&#8217;s COVID Summit.&nbsp; She’ll give remarks on the devastating impacts of COVID on Americans and the steps we&#8217;re taking to manage the threat of new variants.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She’ll also call on the international community to continue to step up and take action to manage the current threat and prepare for future threats.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The U.S. government is bringing the full force of its power to bear.&nbsp; Secretary of State Blinken, Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield, Secretary of Health and Human Services Becerra, USAID Administrator Power, G7 and G20 Sherpa and Deputy National Security Advisor Daleep Singh, and COVID Response Coordinator Ashish Jha will all be participating tomorrow.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The opening session will be followed by three sessions that focus on major challenges that we face in moving from COVID-19 as an emergency to COVID-19 &#8212; eventually &#8212; as a controllable respiratory disease, and to a world that is truly prepared for the biological risks that we face and that are growing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These sessions include focusing on getting vaccines to the world and particularly to the most vulnerable, saving lives by expanding access to tests and treatments, and presen- &#8212; preventing future catastrophes by investing now in health security capacity and workforce.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To date, the summit has leveraged in new money more than $3.1 billion in commitments.&nbsp; These are additional to what has been raised at other points in 2022.&nbsp; They are on top of existing commitments.&nbsp; That’s $3.1 billion.&nbsp; That would not have happened without U.S. leadership.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But if the U.S. is to remain a leader protecting Americans and the world from dangerous disease threats, we need Congress to act now to provide more funding for the COVID response.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As [senior administration official] said, there&#8217;s a lot of chatter about what the U.S. is or isn&#8217;t bringing to the summit.&nbsp; It&#8217;s clear what we&#8217;re bringing: We&#8217;re bringing leadership and over $3.1 billion in leverage commitments that wouldn&#8217;t have arisen without us convening this summit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We come to this summit as the leader in the global COVID response.&nbsp; We’ve pioneered an unprecedented and urgent effort to navigate getting over half a billion lifesaving doses to hundreds of countries around the world with no strings attached.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re the first country to buy doses for the sole purpose of donations &#8212; not a small amount, a billion of them.&nbsp; And we&#8217;ve provided billions in funding for the “last mile” to work to get shots into arms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That didn&#8217;t happen overnight, and it didn&#8217;t happen by accident.&nbsp; It happened because countries and organizations want to step up to the United States and for the administration &#8212; because he has been a leader in this response, President Biden, from day one.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This week, you&#8217;re going to see important commitments of all types.&nbsp; You&#8217;ll see major countries and regional bodies.&nbsp; You&#8217;ll see Canada.&nbsp; You&#8217;ll see the European Commission.&nbsp; You&#8217;ll see the Republic of Korea.&nbsp; You&#8217;ll see Spain and France contributing hundreds of millions of new dollars to get shots into arms.&nbsp; And relatedly, you&#8217;ll see low-income countries committing to accelerations to vaccinate their most vulnerable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You&#8217;ll see political and substantial financial commitments to establish a new Health Security and Pandemic Preparedness fund at the World Bank so that it can stand up this summer.&nbsp; This is something the administration has personally championed.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve been ab- &#8212; we have to be able to walk and chew gum at the same time by preparing now, because the next pandemic could come at any time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And you&#8217;ll also see commitments from companies to look at setting lower prices for treatments and tests, to work with governments and international organizations to expand access for those most at risk &#8212; country by country, community by community.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And finally, you’ll see commitments to help provide facts to overcome the dis- and misinformation which has plagued &#8212; pardon the pun &#8212; this pandemic.</p>



<p>You’ll see companies and other groups stepping up in some really creative ways.&nbsp; We’ve been really heartened by the responses that we’ve gotten from all over the world.&nbsp; This is the power of the United States convening power.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But we’re also digging deep ourselves.&nbsp; So, in terms of what we’re bringing to the table:</p>



<p>We will be providing additional funding for the Global Health Security and Pandemic Preparedness fund at the World Bank.&nbsp; Building on our initial seed pledge of $250 million to establish that fund, we’ll be increasing our pledge by an additional $200 million, for a total of $450 million.&nbsp; The fund will provide sustained financing for improving local, national, and global capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to pandemics and other disease or infectious disease threats.</p>



<p>There is now a strong global consensus to establish this new Pandemic Preparedness and Global Health Security fund at the World Bank.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You may have seen several weeks ago that Indonesia, the G20 president, issued a strong statement from finance ministers signaling political consensus and directing those next steps for this fund to the World Bank and the WHO.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Secretary of the Treasury Yellen, WHO Director-General Tedros, and others have been very publicly vocal about amplifying why this fund is critical to lessen or prevent the next pandemic as part of the overarching reforms of the global health architecture.</p>



<p>Last week, the World Bank sent a memo to their board noting the concept of this is, in its own words, “opening for business by September of 2022.”</p>



<p>We’re also pleased to announce this week that the United States National Institutes of Health licensed 11 COVID-19 research tools and early-stage vaccine and diagnostic candidates to the Medicines Patent Pool under the World Health Organization COVID-19 Technology Access Pool.&nbsp; This includes licensing the NIH stabilized spike protein technology, which is a key component included in multiple existing COVID-19 vaccines. These licenses will enable manufacturers from all over the world to develop vaccines, treatments, and diagnostics for COVID-19 using these technologies, and to distribute them to low- and middle-income countries.</p>



<p>In addition to this important step taken by the NIH, the FDA is also committed to doing its part to facilitate greater global access to these lifesaving products, including through a rapid review of generic products for the global COVID response.</p>



<p>Through the FDA, we confirm our commitment to conduct thorough and efficient reviews of COVID-19 response products.&nbsp; While COVID-19 remains a public health emergency, FDA will prioritize the review of these COVID-19 therapeutics, including applications seeking tentative approval of generic products.&nbsp;</p>



<p>FDA grants tentative approvals for products that meet the requirements for FDA approval but cannot be approved for exclusivity or patent reasons.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Finally, the United States also will pilot test-and-treat strategies for the most vulnerable populations in low- and middle-income countries to help prevent deaths from COVID-19.&nbsp; The U.S. Agency for International Development will use $20 million in order to provide technical assistance and service delivery in up to eight countries to support rapid deployment of tests and treatments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This will leverage $80 million from the global fund that they will use to procure rapid test kits and oral COVID-19 antiviral drugs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It will build on an additional $22 million from Unitaid to provide &#8212; to produce over $120 million in investments to introduce test-and-treatment strategies in over 20 countries in 2022.&nbsp; This collaborative early investment will catalyze test-and-treat adoption and expansion in additional countries.</p>



<p>And this commitment to pilot test-and-treat activities is a down payment on U.S. leadership that can be fully realized if Congress acts to provide the President’s requested COVID-19 supplemental funding.</p>



<p>Despite these commitments to combat COVID-19 and to enhance future preparedness against health threats &#8212; I just want to end by underscoring: Our progress and momentum against COVID-19 is at serious risk without congressional action.&nbsp; We continue to urge the Congress to act promptly to provide supplemental resources.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Without additional emergency COVID-19 funding, the United States will be unable to purchase additional lifesaving treatments for the American people, the United States will be less able to stop the spread of dangerous new variants from around the world, and the United States will be unable to keep vaccinating the world against COVID-19 and getting shots in arms to save lives here, at home, and abroad.</p>



<p>Again, we’re grateful to the world for stepping up at this summit and this critical moment, and we’re optimistic that the commitments that we and others are making will save lives and better prepare us for future threats.</p>



<p>With that, I’ll turn it back over to [senior administration official].&nbsp;</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Thank you, [senior administration officials].&nbsp; Moderator, would you mind giving directions again on how to ask questions?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you so much for doing this.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t see the other two major global vaccine developers on the list of attendees.&nbsp; Were Russia and China invited by the U.S. or any of the other hosts, or did they decline?&nbsp; Or is there a reason that they&#8217;re not involved in this?&nbsp; And how does that affect your ability to reach more people on the globe?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Anita, thank you.&nbsp; We &#8212; in terms of whether Russia was invited: No, we did not extend a commitment ask to them.&nbsp; And with other countries, we have extended and asked for a financial or policy commitment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Your second part of your question was: “How does that affect our efforts to lead the world and for the global response?”&nbsp; Well, you know, I think you&#8217;ll &#8212; you heard from my colleague that we&#8217;re finding amongst the countries, the companies, the philanthropies, and the nonprofits that have committed to this effort that we&#8217;ve mobilized $3.1 billion of financing towards the global fight.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, it&#8217;s clear other countries are stepping up to do their part.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The administration is stepping up to do its part by virtue of cohosting this, by virtue of continuing to lead with the $19 billion of financing provided to us through the American Rescue Plan.&nbsp; And the fight is not done.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so now we really need Congress &#8212; specifically Republicans in Congress &#8212; to show up not with empty words, but with action, and to act on securing and enacting the supplemental while lives remain at risk here and around the world.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, thanks for holding this call.&nbsp; You said the Vice President will be participating.&nbsp; Is President Biden playing any role in this in any form?&nbsp; And can you give us any sense of conversations he&#8217;s had with some of these leaders in an effort to sort of engage them in adding value to the sum that you&#8217;re trying to collect?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Thanks, Peter, for your question.&nbsp; The Vice President will join leaders in the headline session at tomorrow&#8217;s summit.&nbsp; She&#8217;ll give remarks on the devastating impact of COVID on Americans and the steps that we&#8217;re taking to manage threats of new variants.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And that&#8217;s what this is partly about.&nbsp; It&#8217;s about saving lives abroad.&nbsp; But we also know new variants come from &#8212; have come from abroad, and this is about stopping those because that will also ensure the gains we&#8217;ve made in this country are protected and American lives are saved, and that businesses and schools continue to not be disrupted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The President will address participants, and he will have a resounding commitment to ensuring that the goals of the summit &#8212; to prevent complacency, to prevent deaths, and to prevent future variants and pandemics &#8212; are front and center.&nbsp; His team has been engaged with the teams of the other cohosts all the way up to their presidencies.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve been meeting almost every other day, if not every day, to plan this together.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so, you know, this summit &#8212; the commitment here and the progress we&#8217;ve made overall just wouldn&#8217;t be happening without the leadership of both the President, the Vice President, and several members &#8212; as you heard &#8212; of the Cabinet that are going to be speaking tomorrow.</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Thank you, [senior administration official].&nbsp; And thank you, everyone, again, for joining our call.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Again, this call is now embargoed until 7:00 a.m. tomorrow, May 12th, and it’s on background, attributable to a “senior administration official.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Also, for planning purposes only, the summit is scheduled to start at 9:00 a.m. tomorrow.&nbsp; And you can look at our advisory for the livestream link.&nbsp; And it will kick off with the President&#8217;s remarks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thanks to all.</p>



<p>6:27 P.M. EDT</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>South Court Auditorium<br><em>Eisenhower Executive Office Building</em></em></p>



<p>9:36 A.M. EDT<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Thank you, Madam Ambassador.&nbsp; And thank you, all of you, for co-hosting this very important convening: Prime Minister Briceño; the President, of course, Sall of Senegal; and Chancellor Scholz; and President Widodo.&nbsp; Thank you all.&nbsp; And I also see my friend, Prime Minister Trudeau.&nbsp; And, President Sánchez, I want to thank you as well and everyone who is here with us today.<br>&nbsp;<br>Today marks a solemn milestone for us in the United States: the loss of one million American lives due to COVID-19.&nbsp; One million lives.<br>&nbsp;<br>Today and every day, we remember them, of course, and we honor them.&nbsp; And I send my prayers to their loved ones.&nbsp; And I recognize all the pain that has been endured by them and those who have lost loved ones around the world.&nbsp;<br><br>I believe we owe it to their memories and to the millions of other lives lost around the world to renew our fight against this deadly virus, which brings me to why, of course, we are all gathered here today.<br>&nbsp;<br>Over the last two years, as we all know, COVID has had a devastating impact on people around the globe: economic shocks, a massive disruption to so many parts of our daily lives.<br>&nbsp;<br>And of course, yes, we have made remarkable progress.&nbsp; Yet without continued action, lives and livelihoods will continue to be at risk.&nbsp; This is why our administration is hard at work in Washington, D.C., doing everything we can.<br>&nbsp;<br>As you heard just a moment ago from President Joe Biden, there are a number of ways in which we have and will continue to take action.<br>&nbsp;<br>We have called upon the United States Congress for $22.5 billion dollars in additional emergency funding to battle COVID. &nbsp;Five billion dollars of that would be dedicated to continue our leadership in helping to save lives around the world.&nbsp;<br><br>We will continue to advocate for these lifesaving resources as part of our global commitment.<br>&nbsp;<br>All of you in this headliners session have also taken very important steps and have made key commitments, and we thank you.<br>&nbsp;<br>In our collective words and actions, we are all making clear complacency is not an option.<br>&nbsp;<br>As we gather today, our goals are twofold: One, we must continue to respond to the threat.&nbsp; And two, we must prepare for the future.<br>&nbsp;<br>As long as the COVID virus is present in one country, it impacts all of us.<br>&nbsp;<br>This pandemic, of course, knows no borders, and we must continue to work together to find solutions.<br>&nbsp;<br>We still &#8212; as has been said, we still need to make vaccines, tests, and new treatments accessible to all and especially to those who are highest at risk: the elderly, the immunocompromised, and healthcare workers.<br>&nbsp;<br>I am also aware that countries throughout the world need more training for doctors and nurses and community health workers; and more technical assistance, including freezers, to help get shots in arms.&nbsp; We look forward to partnering with all of you on this.<br>&nbsp;<br>We must also keep an eye to the future.&nbsp; We have learned key lessons in the past two years &#8212; lessons about the importance of early detection and surveillance; the need to leverage the private sector and non-profits to scale production of medicines and tests and vaccines; the transformative power of investments in health systems and health workers; the complicated mechanics of donating and distributing hundreds of millions of vaccines around the world; and the lifesaving benefits of a global health security fund.<br>&nbsp;<br>Last year, at this very summit, we discussed this particular lesson.&nbsp; And you’ll recall I urged us to work together to develop a new financing system and mechanism.<br>&nbsp;<br>Thanks to President Widodo and Prime Minister Draghi, through the G20, we have consensus to establish this fund.&nbsp; And I know we all know and have said it will help us on very critical issues like early detection and warning systems, and investments in rapid recovery and response.&nbsp; And this is just the beginning.<br>&nbsp;<br>The way I see it is this: As we think about moving forward, I believe we can also come together &#8212; in addition to everything we have discussed &#8212; come together to shape new international norms on these issues.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Together, we can establish common understandings that guide our collective action: that all countries, regardless of GDP, should have access to lifesaving vaccines, tests, and therapeutics; that nations should be transparent and share information early and often; that leaders should prioritize the most vulnerable and the overlooked; and that we must recognize and address inequities in our systems.<br>&nbsp;<br>The future, of course, will present other global health crises, but they don’t have to become catastrophes if we do this work together.<br>&nbsp;<br>Now is the time, we know, for bold thinking and concrete action.&nbsp; And I look forward to this discussion and continuing discussions, and the work we will do together to shape the future of global health and health security around the world.<br>&nbsp;<br>Thank you all.<br>&nbsp;<br>END&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9:42 A.M. EDT</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The second Global COVID-19 Summit, co-hosted by United States, Belize, Germany, Indonesia, and Senegal, convened over partners and organizations from around the world to accelerate collective efforts to get shots into arms, enhance access to tests and treatments, protect the health workforce, and finance and build health security for future pandemics and other health crises.&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>The second Global COVID-19 Summit, co-hosted by United States, Belize, Germany, Indonesia, and Senegal, convened over partners and organizations from around the world to accelerate collective efforts to get shots into arms, enhance access to tests and treatments, protect the health workforce, and finance and build health security for future pandemics and other health crises.</p>



<p>The Summit garnered new financial commitments totaling more than $3 billion in new funding, not yet announced, above and beyond pledges made to date in 2022. This includes over $2 billion for immediate COVID-19 response and $962 million in commitments toward a new pandemic preparedness and global health security fund at the World Bank. We encourage partners to join, as much more is needed to control COVID-19 and build better health security.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Preventing Complacency and Prioritizing Preparedness</em></p>



<p>Today, the United States, Belize, Germany, Indonesia, and Senegal convened other heads of state and world leaders from international organizations, the private sector, philanthropies, non-government organizations, and other partners for the 2nd Global COVID-19 Summit. &nbsp;<br><br>The United States issued a call to redouble global efforts to control the COVID-19 pandemic and prepare for future health emergencies.&nbsp; The U.S. &nbsp;urged the world to prevent complacency and to keep political will strong. We also called on leaders to accelerate financial and policy commitments – country by country, community by community – to get shots into arms; expand access to tests and treatments; protect those at highest risk; and prevent future catastrophes by building and financing country capacity, health workers, disease surveillance, and medical countermeasures, including through the new health security fund at the World Bank<strong>.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Vice President Harris highlighted U.S. leadership and called on Congress to </strong><strong>continue to make Americans and the world safer by promptly providing the $22.5 billion in supplemental funding for responding to COVID-19 that the Administration requested on March 2, 2022, <u>including $5 billion to support the global effort</u> to stop the spread of potential new variants, get shots into arms, expand access to tests and treatments, and save lives here at home and abroad.</strong></p>



<p>U.S. leadership in vaccinating the world, saving lives, and building better health security</p>



<p>This Summit continues to highlight American leadership in the global COVID-19 response. &nbsp;As the world’s largest donor, the United States has to date provided more than $19 billion in health, humanitarian, and economic assistance and has committed to provide 1.2 billon vaccine doses to the world for free, of which we have already provided more than 535 million doses.</p>



<p>At the Summit, the United States called the world to action alongside co-hosts Belize, Germany, Indonesia, and Senegal. &nbsp;Leaders from around the world made bold new commitments to control COVID-19 and prevent future health crises.&nbsp; The U.S. announced new commitments to the global COVID-19 response and pandemic preparedness, building on substantial U.S. commitments made to date and during the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/09/22/fact-sheet-president-bidens-global-covid-19-summit-ending-the-pandemic-and-building-back-better/">last global COVID-19 Summit</a>:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Additional funding for a pandemic preparedness [and global health security] fund housed at the World Bank.&nbsp; </strong>Building on its initial commitment of $250 million previously announced at the first Global COVID-19 Summit, the United States intends to increase its initial contribution toward the establishment of the new pandemic preparedness and global health security fund at the World Bank by an additional $200 million, for a total of $450 million. Combined with funding pledged today by other donors, this funding makes a total of at least $960 million in seed funding in advance of the Fund’s launch this summer.&nbsp; The Fund will provide sustained financing for improving national, regional, and global capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to pandemics and other infectious disease threats.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Sharing U.S. Government COVID-19 vaccine-related intellectual property and research tools for greater global access. </strong>Through the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the United States has recently licensed research tools and the intellectual property for several COVID-19 technologies to the Medicines Patent Pool, through the WHO COVID-19 Technology Access Pool. The licenses include the patent for the stabilized spike protein used in multiple existing COVID-19 vaccines. These licenses will enable manufacturers from around the world to use these technologies.</li></ul>



<ul><li>The United States, through the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), confirms its commitment to conducting thorough and efficient reviews of COVID-19 response products. While COVID-19 remains a public health emergency, FDA will prioritize the review of COVID-19 therapeutics, including applications seeking tentative approval of generic products.&nbsp; FDA grants tentative approvals for products that meet the requirements for FDA approval but cannot be approved for exclusivity or patent reasons.&nbsp; <strong></strong></li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Test and Treat Strategy</strong>. The United States, alongside the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria (“Global Fund”), Unitaid, and other ACT-Accelerator partners, will promote “test-and-treat” strategies for the most vulnerable populations in low and middle-income countries to help prevent hospitalizations and deaths from COVID-19. The Global Fund will procure up to $80 million in COVID-19 rapid test kits and oral COVID-19 antiviral drugs, which would be linked to $20 million of American Rescue Plan Act funds that the U.S. Agency for International Development plans to use to quickly scale up test-and-treat implementation in up to eight countries globally in 2022, in coordination with other U.S. Government programs, including PEPFAR.&nbsp;It would build on an additional $22 million from Unitaid to produce over $120 million in investments to introduce test and treatment strategies in over 20 countries in 2022. This collaborative early investment would catalyze test-and-treat adoption and expansion in additional countries<strong>. This commitment is a down payment on U.S. leadership that can be fully realized if Congress acts to provide the President’s requested COVID-19 supplemental funding.</strong></li><li><strong>Additional vaccination support through Global VAX.</strong> Building on the more than $1.7 billion in funds committed to date, The United States, through the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), is providing an additional $15 million the U.S. Initiative for Global Vaccine Access (Global VAX), a whole-of-government effort to accelerate and expand vaccine readiness uptake in high-need countries, including 11 surge support countries. This funding will enable CDC to provide additional technical assistance and service delivery to countries for vaccination efforts, with a focus on high-risk populations. This will build upon $1.7 billion the United States is already providing through Global VAX.</li><li><strong>Expanded investments in&nbsp;bilateral global health security programs. &nbsp;</strong>To advance the Global Health Security Agenda and to accelerate the implementation of U.S. Global Health Security Strategy, the U.S. government will expand the number of global health security intensive support partner countries by eight this year, including to three new regions. This will improve countries’ capacities to prevent, detect, and respond to future COVID-19 variants and future health threats.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Expanding dose donation types to include boosters and pediatric doses to accelerate global vaccine coverage</strong>. The United States is <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2022/04/05/press-briefing-by-white-house-covid-19-response-team-and-hhs-public-health-officials-april-5-2022/">expanding Pfizer vaccine dose types</a> being donated globally to now include boosters and pediatric doses, as part of our 1 billion Pfizer dose donation commitment. This will help accelerate progress towards the 70% vaccination target and expand the availability of doses available for those at highest risk and for children globally.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Improving guidance for vaccine development to enhance protection. </strong>The United States, through the FDA, is committing to help align global health authorities and the WHO to provide advice to COVID-19 vaccine producers to inform which strains they use as the basis for vaccines, using predictions about the predominance of future strains and which strains will lead to vaccines that provide the broadest protection against unknown future variants.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Financing facility for COVID-19 vaccine and ancillary supply purchases and delivery through the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC). </strong> DFC has set up a vehicle to provide up to $1 billion to Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, to provide bridge financing guaranteeing commitments from other donors. This will allow COVAX to react immediately in a crisis to purchase and deliver ancillary supplies and vaccines on behalf of developing countries participating in the COVAX Advance Market Commitment.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Advancing COVID-19 vaccine research and development through the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI).&nbsp; </strong>At least $50 million of the U.S. Government’s <a href="https://www.usaid.gov/news-information/press-releases/mar-8-2022-usaid-announces-150-million-stimulate-and-accelerate-development">recent $150 million, 3-year pledge to CEPI</a> will support COVID-19 vaccine research in addition to the development of other vaccines and countermeasures for future emerging infectious diseases, with the goals of making vaccines more broadly protective and easier to administer in low-resource settings.</li></ul>



<p>Despite these commitments to combat COVID-19 and enhance future preparedness against health threats<strong>, there is more work to be done to ensure the United States can continue to lead, to make Americans and the world safer.</strong>&nbsp; President Biden continues to urge Congress to act promptly to provide supplemental resources. Without additional emergency funding, the United States will be unable to purchase additional life-saving treatments for the American people.&nbsp; The United States will be less able to stop the spread of possible new variants from around the world.&nbsp; The United States will be unable to keep vaccinating the world against COVID-19 and getting shots into arms, to save lives here at home and abroad.</p>

<p>The United States of America and the European Union are implementing the <strong>U.S.-EU Agenda for Beating the Global Pandemic, Vaccinating the World, Saving Lives Now and Building Back Better Health Security </strong>of <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/09/22/a-u-s-eu-agenda-for-beating-the-global-pandemic-vaccinating-the-world-saving-lives-now-and-building-back-better-health-security/">September 22, 2021</a>. Today, Presidents Biden and von der Leyen reaffirmed milestones in their strong cooperation towards the five headline goals of the Agenda, and they previewed further joint action below:</p>



<p><strong><em>Vaccine equity and ‘shots-in-arms’. </em></strong>Having shared a combined total of more than one billion COVID-19 vaccine doses, and in line with a commitment to share a total of 1.9 billion doses around the world, the EU and U.S. seek to ensure ongoing <strong>deliveries are based on country demand, informed by best practices and reach ‘tarmac to arms’</strong>, with focus on sub-Saharan Africa. Through support from Team Europe and U.S. Global VAX programs, both sides recognise that vaccine equity starts with best practice donation principles including adequate and transparent planning in <strong>cooperation with governments, in-country partners, COVAX (as part of ACT-A), Africa Vaccine Acquisition Task Team (AVATT), World Health Organization (WHO), the COVID- 19 Vaccine Delivery Partnership (CoVDP), </strong>and others. Given that dose supply is currently not constrained, the partnership should pay particular attention to enhancing vaccine readiness, strengthening logistics, combating hesitancy, and building longer-term capacity by means of health systems strengthening, and immediate capability for vaccine uptake as part of the global COVID-19 Vaccine Delivery Partnership. To strengthen our partnership, the U.S. and EU will actively consult with partners including AVATT, CoVDP, and COVAX on strategies to accelerate vaccine absorption. The U.S. and EU will strengthen dialogues with multilateral development banks and global partners aiming towards better uptake of and sustainable financing for in-country vaccination operations.<br><br></p>



<p><strong><em>Strengthening global supply chains and manufacturing. </em></strong>The need to ensure vaccine and therapeutic dose supply and administration in the face of supply chain constraints led to the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/STATEMENT_21_4847">launch</a> of the joint <strong>EU-U.S. COVID-19 manufacturing and supply chain task force </strong>in September 2021. The leaders expect that the task force will extend its activities to provide <strong>early warning of supply chain bottlenecks </strong>that could hamper global availability of vaccines and treatments, and to coordinate efforts to sustain vaccine and therapeutics production capabilities for variants and future pandemics, including in Africa.<br><br></p>



<p><strong><em>Enhanced EU-US coordination to improve global health security architecture. </em></strong>Enhancing pandemic prevention, preparedness and response (PPR) capacities requires strong international cooperation, and the U.S. and the EU are committed to cooperate to this end, including under the lines of effort of the COVID-19 Prioritized Global Action Plan for Enhanced Engagement (GAP). Enhanced PPR requires a strengthening of the global health architecture, including of the WHO at the center, and sustainable financing. Presidents Biden and von der Leyen welcomed the support of the G20 under Indonesia’s leadership, and committed to cooperate on the establishment of a new <strong>Financial Intermediary Fund (FIF) for pandemic preparedness and global health security </strong>at the World Bank, including its <strong>sustainable capitalization</strong>, governance and structure. The U.S. and EU committed to support the early design and implementation of the FIF. The leaders will also cooperate towards the conclusion of a convention, agreement or other international instrument on pandemic prevention, preparedness and response at the WHO, and targeted amendments to the International Health Regulations, in order to <strong>strengthen the global rulebook for pandemic PPR</strong>. The EU and the U.S. are working together with <strong>expert dialogue </strong>to forge consensus on targeted IHR amendments and the content of a pandemic instrument. They also recognise the importance of engagement with other partners to take forward both sustainable financing for PPR and a strengthened WHO.<br><br></p>



<p><strong><em>Preparing for the future, pathogen detection and monitoring, joint threat assessment and response. </em></strong>The EU and U.S. will collaborate to improve pathogen monitoring and threat assessment, leveraging existing and novel approaches, providing integrated surveillance, real-time monitoring, early warning systems, forecasting and analytics, intelligence exchange, supporting rapid response networks, and an ‘always-ready’ health emergency workforce to prevent or mitigate cross-border outbreaks, all within a One Health approach.</p>



<p><strong><em>Research and development for new vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics. </em></strong>Acknowledging the importance of swiftly reacting to pandemics, the U.S. and EU support science to shorten the cycle for the development of safe and effective vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics from 300 to 100 days following the identification of such threats and work to make them widely available. In the near term, the EU and U.S. committed to deepen <strong>cooperation to identify and evaluate variant adapted, more broadly protective, and next generation vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics, while ensuring their safety and efficacy</strong>. The U.S. and the EU will work towards aligning R&amp;D investments with manufacturing and manufacturing capabilities development, and will conclude a formal administrative arrangement on preparedness and response for public health threats to be signed this month between the European Commission Health Emergency and Preparedness Response Authority (HERA) and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.</p>

<p>Today, we mark a tragic milestone: &nbsp;one million American lives lost to COVID-19. &nbsp;One million empty chairs around the dinner table. &nbsp;Each an irreplaceable loss. &nbsp;Each leaving behind a family, a community, and a Nation forever changed because of this pandemic. &nbsp;Jill and I pray for each of them.</p>



<p>As a Nation, we must not grow numb to such sorrow. &nbsp;To heal, we must remember. &nbsp;We must remain vigilant against this pandemic and do everything we can to save as many lives as possible. &nbsp;In remembrance, let us draw strength from each other as fellow Americans. &nbsp;For while we have been humbled, we never give up.&nbsp; We can and will do this together as the United States of America.</p>



<p>In memory of the one million American lives lost to COVID-19 and their loved ones left behind, I hereby order, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, that the flag of the United States shall be flown at half-staff at the White House and on all public buildings and grounds, at all military posts and naval stations, and on all naval vessels of the Federal Government in the District of Columbia and throughout the United States and its Territories and possessions until sunset May 16, 2022.  I also direct that the flag shall be flown at half-staff for the same period at all United States embassies, legations, consular offices, and other facilities abroad, including all military facilities and naval vessels and stations.</p>



<p>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twelfth day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-sixth.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-right">JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.</p>
