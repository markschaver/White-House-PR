<p>11:07 A.M. EST</p>



<p>MODERATOR:  Thanks, everyone, for joining us.  As mentioned, this is a call to preview the U.S. strategy towards the Indo-Pacific.  This call is on background and attributable to a “senior administration official.” </p>



<p>As you might have all seen, we updated the invite, and the embargo is now 3:00 p.m. Eastern.&nbsp; So just keep that in mind.</p>



<p>For your awareness and not for reporting, the speaker on the call today is [senior administration official].&nbsp; And with that, I will turn it over to [senior administration official] for some opening remarks.&nbsp; And then we&#8217;ll get to some questions.</p>



<p>Over to you.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Thank you so much.&nbsp; And thank you all for joining.</p>



<p>So, as [moderator] just said, today we are rolling out President Biden&#8217;s comprehensive vision for an Indo-Pacific that is free, open, prosperous, secure, and resilient.</p>



<p>Secretary of State Blinken is in the region right now to share it with our partners, while continuing to strengthen key diplomatic relationships and advance our shared priorities.</p>



<p>And, you know, I think it&#8217;s worth highlighting the significance of Secretary Blinken speaking about the strategy while he&#8217;s in Fiji.&nbsp; The U.S. is a Pacific nation, and we are going to devote significant attention to the Pacific Islands as part of the strategy, which you should be seeing.</p>



<p>So, you know, just to frame this: You know, as some of you remember, Secretary Blinken was in the region in December of last year.&nbsp; And while he was in Indonesia, he spoke about President Biden&#8217;s vision to more firmly anchor the United States in the Indo-Pacific and strengthen the region in the process.&nbsp; And he&#8217;ll build on that vision and articulate it more explicitly in the form of this strategy and his statements while he&#8217;s in Fiji &#8212; tonight our time, tomorrow their time.</p>



<p>I want to take a minute to talk about why we are releasing this strategy and how it&#8217;s different than others in the past.</p>



<p>For some time, leaders from both political parties, and certainly on Capitol Hill, have recognized the growing importance of the Indo-Pacific.&nbsp; This strategy is part of that tradition and builds on the work of previous administrations and, I think, the broader consensus that has emerged on the importance of the Indo-Pacific region.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It argues that no region will be more vital to the United States in the future and that American security and prosperity fundamentally depend on that of the Indo-Pacific.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think it&#8217;s important to make clear that, in our view, this vision is shared in a bipartisan fashion at home, in the region, and also with key partners, including in Europe.</p>



<p>There are two key elements to our approach.&nbsp;</p>



<p>First, the goal of this strategy is to strengthen the U.S. role in the region, which we believe is very important to the region but obviously very important to us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Second, we seek to build the collective capacity to rise to 21st century challenges and seize opportunities, whether that has to do with climate, with PRC behavior, or preparing for the next pandemic and recovering from this one.</p>



<p>This strategy builds on the work that we&#8217;ve already been doing in the region and, I think, all of you have seen in the first year of the administration.&nbsp; The administration has made history, marking the first and the second time that the Quad &#8212; which, as you know, is the U.S., Australia, India, and Japan &#8212; has met at the leader level.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And as an aside, I would just note that Secretary Blinken was just in Australia meeting with the Quad foreign ministers.&nbsp; This marks the third meeting &#8212; in-person meeting of the ministers and the second standalone meeting and the first standalone in-person meeting of this administration.&nbsp; I think it reflects the continuing commitment to developing the Quad.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Also, other things that we&#8217;ve been doing, and I think all of you are aware: For the first time in seven decades, the U.S. has committed to share our most sensitive nuclear submarine technology with another country, and launching AUKUS was a key way to bolster deterrence in the Indo-Pacific.&nbsp; And building that out, we believe, has significant advantages for the U.S., for our partners, but more broadly for the region.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is the first &#8212; it is also &#8212; we’ve seen the first time a sitting U.S. President has addressed the Pacific Islands Forum.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s the first time that we &#8212; that every member of the G7 and the Republic of Korea have stated publicly the importance of peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve also &#8212; and you may have seen yesterday &#8212; we announced that we will be hosting APEC in 2023, which we very much look forward to serving to, both to strengthen our engagement in the region but also to advance key economic objectives that will &#8212; we believe can better &#8212; ensure that our economic engagement better serves all of our citizens across the region.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And we&#8217;ve strengthened our alliances and partnerships in Southeast Asia, harmonizing our approaches on critical and emerging technologies and working to strengthen supply chains.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You all have the full strategy in hand, so I&#8217;m not going to go through everything, but I&#8217;ll quickly lay out the key pillars: Number one is to advance freedom and openness.&nbsp; Number two is to build collective capacity within and beyond the region.&nbsp; Number three is to promote shared prosperity.&nbsp; Number four is to bolster Indo-Pacific security.&nbsp; And number five is to build regional resilience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I just want to lay out very quickly, and then I&#8217;ll turn it over to you for questions, about the key ways in which we will put the strategy further into action.</p>



<p>Some of the core lines of effort we’ll pursue in the coming 12 to 24 months is:</p>



<ul><li>Drive new resources in the Indo-Pacific, including by working with Congress.</li><li>Launch the Indo-Pacific economic framework.</li><li>Reinforce deterrence, including by working with our partners in AUKUS.</li><li>Support India&#8217;s continued rise and regional leadership.</li><li>Deliver on what we see as the tremendous potential and promise of the Quad.</li><li>Expand our efforts in the Pacific Islands.</li><li>Grow Japan-ROK cooperation as part of strengthening our ability to work trilaterally.&nbsp; And it’s in that context, I note, that Secretary Blinken will be meeting with his ROK and Japanese counterparts in a trilateral meeting in Hawaii tomorrow and that our Special Representative for North Korea, Sung Kim, has just met with his counterparts in Hawaii yesterday.</li><li>And then we also &#8212; obviously, as a critical part of our efforts is supporting good governance and accountability and making sure that the citiz- &#8212; that the governments in the region are responsive to their citizens.&nbsp;</li><li>And then promoting open, resilient, secure, trustworthy tech, including 5G, OpenRAN, and cyber capacity.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>And I think that the key thing is &#8212; to just emphasize: This builds on the longstanding</p>



<p>U.S. engagement in the region.&nbsp; It builds on the work of previous administrations.&nbsp; And it builds on what we see as a very broad, bipartisan consensus in the United States on the importance of the region, including the very strong people-to-people ties that are part of anchoring us in the region and our status as a Pacific nation.</p>



<p>However, it’s worth keeping of mind: This is not our China strategy.&nbsp; This &#8212; you know, we very clearly identify China as one of the challenges that is &#8212; that the region faces and, in particular, the rise of China and China’s much more assertive and aggressive behavior.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, you know, our China strategy is global in scope.&nbsp; It recognizes the Indo-Pacific as a particularly intense region of competition.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And over the past year, you’ve seen some of the key elements of our strategy in action.&nbsp; You know, these include investing in ourselves, aligning with our allies and partners, which will allow us to compete more effectively with China, and also making sure that we’re able to responsibly manage the competition so it does not veer into conflict.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We recognize the limitations in our ability to change China, and therefore seek to shape the strategic environment around China by building a balance of influences that advances the future we seek, while blunting Beijing’s efforts to frustrate U.S. objectives and those of our partners.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, you know, I think that &#8212; in that context, I would just note that in our engagements in the past year &#8212; and I think this is very much what previous administrations saw &#8212; we’ve heard very clearly the importance of the U.S. playing an affirmative, positive role in the region.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is great appreciation for what the U.S. has been able to do and has helped the region accomplish in the past, you know, however many years.&nbsp; And we really &#8212; you know, if we could go back to it &#8212; we have had strong trading links to the region, going back for, you know, more than &#8212; well over a century.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We’ve had strong interests in the region.&nbsp; And we’ve been playing a critical role in the region since the end of World War Two.&nbsp; Countries in the region want to see the U.S. continuing to play an important role.&nbsp; And they want to continue to see an affirmative U.S. vision for what we are doing that is not couched in suggesting that countries need to take sides.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our view is that what we want to do is to, you know, make sure that we are building on this longstanding track record while at the same time updating our approach to deal with the challenges of today, which obviously include China but also include climate change &#8212; which, as you know, is existential for many of the countries in the region &#8212; but also dealing with recovery from the pandemic, which &#8212; you know, I think one of the things Secretary Blinken will be meeting with the leaders of the Pacific Islands Forum while he&#8217;s in Fiji &#8212; you know, the pandemic has been particularly devastating economically for the islands, for the island states, and &#8212; which also face, obviously, extraordinary challenges from climate change.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, I think that we believe there is a real interest in a positive U.S. vision that builds on what we&#8217;ve done, that updates it, that recognizes that we have to work with allies and partners in the region, as well as from outside the region, to be effective.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That builds on, I think, the very clear articulation that we&#8217;ve seen from the EU, that we&#8217;ve seen from others about their Indo-Pacific vision, but also builds on those much stronger links that we&#8217;re in the process of building with key players throughout the region.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So with that, I&#8217;ll take questions.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MODERATOR:&nbsp; Great.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi.&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; Two quick questions.&nbsp; One is: Could you maybe elaborate or just expand a little bit on our thinking of &#8212; or your thinking of how the U.S. policy towards Taiwan and its potential defense may have evolved, or just how you&#8217;re kind of currently thinking about that?<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But also, like, with AUKUS, we saw Australia kind of really stop hedging its bets and maybe kind of sign up with the U.S. and others.&nbsp; Do you see progress on that front with a country like India, which is not quite so sure yet?&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; So, look, let me just first touch on Taiwan.&nbsp; Obviously, we fully recognize the importance of peace and stability in and across the straits of Taiwan.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think, you know, we explicitly say that we will work with partners inside and outside the region to maintain peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, including by supporting Taiwan’s self-defense capabilities, to ensure an environment in which Taiwan&#8217;s future is determined peacefully in accordance with the wishes and best interests of Taiwan&#8217;s people.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You know, we see &#8212; and I think you&#8217;ve seen our efforts to get more countries to articulate the strong interests that virtually everybody has in maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.&nbsp; And I think that we will continue working on that effort.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I think that we believe that the greater interest in the Indo-Pacific from partners outside the region is a real opportunity to expand the international interest in this and sent very clear signals to all concerned about the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the strait.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With regard to India, I think we very explicitly highlight the importance of, you know, what the last four administrations have all played a very important role in advancing, which is the much greater U.S. engagement, much improved U.S. relations with and much closer U.S. partnership with India.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, obviously, India&#8217;s role in the Quad, I think, is a very significant element of that, including the much-enhanced ability to speak frankly about issues in the region; to work together to deliver, you know, essentially, public goods that address, you know, challenges in the region; and to enhance ways in which we can coordinate.&nbsp; You know, so we see this as a very, very high priority.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Obviously, you know, India is in a very different place, in many ways, than Australia, than other countries.&nbsp; But India faces very significant challenges.&nbsp; And I think that, you know, China&#8217;s behavior in the line of actual control has had a galvanizing impact on India.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I think that, you know, from our standpoint, we see tremendous opportunities in working with another democracy, with a country that has a maritime tradition that understands the importance of the global commons to advance critical issues in the region.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, hopefully, that answers your question.&nbsp; But I would just note, you know, there is tremendous appreciation of the importance and the challenges of engage &#8212; of strengthening the engagement with India and a recognition that India is a critical strategic partner, and a desire to continue building on the very good work of previous administrations to significantly broaden and deepen that relationship.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; Can you hear me?&nbsp;</p>



<p>OPERATOR:&nbsp; Yes, we can.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay, sorry about that.&nbsp; I fear this is too much of a 30,000-foot question, but I was wondering if you could take a stab at it.&nbsp; Do you think China came into this administration hoping for a reset, and they&#8217;ve been disappointed and are now acknowledging there&#8217;s going to be a lot of continuity from the Trump administration pivot on China and what you&#8217;re announcing today?</p>



<p>And are you trying to design a strategy that can survive any future change in administration and keep at bay some of the arguments, for example, that we saw in Senator Sanders’s Foreign Affairs article, you know, “Washington&#8217;s Dangerous New Consensus on China”?&nbsp; Thanks.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Look, those are very good questions.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t want to be in the position of trying to characterize what China believed or didn&#8217;t believe.&nbsp; I mean &#8212; you know, but I think that, from our standpoint, we believe that there are some key elements that we lay out in the strategy of our concerns &#8212; and concerns which I think are broadly shared in the region &#8212; about some of China&#8217;s actions and China&#8217;s behavior, and that there is a strong desire &#8212; and we&#8217;ve heard that very clearly from allies and partners and countries across the region as we&#8217;ve engaged with them &#8212; there&#8217;s a strong desire for the U.S. to be there.</p>



<p>I think that in terms of &#8212; you know, I’d &#8212; you know, look, in terms of, like, how long this lasts: I think that what we have seen and what we, you know, have explicitly built on &#8212; that there&#8217;s been longstanding continuity that is, you know, across administrations and across parties in terms of looking at the basic principles of what we do with the region.&nbsp; That&#8217;s not to say that everything has been identical.&nbsp; Obviously, there have been differences, and there&#8217;s been some evolution.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But I think that we can go back a number of administrations and see a much greater focus on the Indo-Pacific &#8212; a recognition of how much of growth in, you know, recent years has been driven by the Indo-Pacific and how much of global growth in coming years is likely to be driven by the Indo-Pacific.</p>



<p>I think that there&#8217;s also a recognition that the basic ways in which the U.S. deals with the region need to evolve.&nbsp; And so, we&#8217;ve been working on that, and I think we will continue to do this.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think that the key things for us is: We want to highlight the areas where there is broad agreement because, obviously, that is, you know, reassuring to the region.&nbsp; And I think it&#8217;s important to also make clear that we fully recognize the debt that we owe to a variety of predecessors, but to make also clear our vision for &#8212; and the President&#8217;s vision for how we engage with the region.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think that, you know, one of the challenges is obviously, you know, there &#8212; it’s &#8212; and it’s always a challenge &#8212; is: How do you mobilize resources?&nbsp; How do you sustain focus to ensure continuity?&nbsp; You know, I think that, in our view, we are continuing to build on what&#8217;s been done before; we&#8217;re trying to expand it, trying to modernize it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You know, I would just note, you know, the focus on the Quad, taking it to the leader level; AUKUS; trying to expand engagement with ASEAN institutionally &#8212; these are things which, you know, in some ways build on what&#8217;s been done in the past, but will also reflect the President&#8217;s view and the administration&#8217;s view of the importance of moving quickly to deal with the new realities that we confront.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Could you explain &#8212;</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; Patsy, did you have a question?&nbsp; We didn’t hear you.&nbsp; Patsy?&nbsp; Okay, let’s &#8212; let’s just go to our next question, please.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Hello? &nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you hear me?&nbsp;</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay, great.&nbsp; Thank you so much for doing this.&nbsp; Just two quick questions.&nbsp; Could you just talk first about the timing of the strategy?&nbsp;&nbsp; Because President Biden had stressed repeatedly the importance of establishing close partnership with the region, but it&#8217;s taken over a year for this strategy to finally be released.&nbsp; So, what was the reason behind this?&nbsp;</p>



<p>And my second question is: How much of an impact, if any, does the ongoing situation in Ukraine and Russia have on crafting the Indo-Pacific strategy in how the U.S. wants to work with the region to stand up to Russia?&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Okay, thank you for that.&nbsp; Look, I mean, the first thing I’d do is just point out that this is, in fact, the first regional strategy to come out.&nbsp; So, I think that that does signal the importance the administration puts on the region.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think that, you know, in terms of the time it took &#8212; look, I mean, this is a challenge always to do in a way that brings in and has coordination across the administration, across the different departments and agencies of the U.S. government &#8212; that, you know, we wanted to listen, to make clear that we understood and heard what countries in the region said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So &#8212; and we didn&#8217;t want to do this &#8212; and I think the admin- &#8212; the pres- &#8212; the view was not that we immediately roll this out.&nbsp; It’s that we wanted to do something that was reflective of input from allies and partners &#8212; input from the region &#8212; and that was a considered view across the administration.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, you know, hopefully, that &#8212; you know, we believe that we have a document that does those things, that &#8212; and, in particular, that reflects very much inputs that we got from a variety of partners, both in the region and outside.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I would note that one of the things that we particularly call out and is &#8212; the potential we see in cooperation with other outside players that have their own Indo-Pacific strategies &#8212; and I would note particularly the EU, but also France, the UK, other countries in Europe that are significantly ramping up their engagement.&nbsp; We see that as offering a tremendous amount of potential to expand cooperation.</p>



<p>And I think that one of the things that this is particularly, you know, reflective of is &#8212; and the experience of &#8212; in the first year, and it reflects the President&#8217;s very fundamental view: To be successful, we have to work close with our allies and partners.&nbsp; And I think that that is something that is very much baked into this.&nbsp; And that desire to expand those relationships also change, perhaps, some of the structures, including by emphasizing the Quad, AUKUS &#8212; building up AUKUS.&nbsp; These are things that reflect the understanding of the realities in the region.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In terms of &#8212; on the question about standing up to Russia: Look, I mean, obviously, there are always going to be challenges.&nbsp; And I think that one of the fundamental, you know, issues in American foreign policy is it is almost always hard to provide the kind of, you know, sole focus on one region because things inevitably are happening elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think that we are very confident of our ability to walk and chew gum at the same time.&nbsp; And I would just note that Secretary Blinken is in the region right now.&nbsp; He has done the Quad foreign ministers meeting in Australia, which is, you know, really the continued expansion of form and framework that was created before but which this administration has invested heavily in upgrading and expanding.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He&#8217;s going to Fiji where he&#8217;s meeting with the leaders of the Pacific Islands Forum.&nbsp; And again, you know, secretaries of state have engaged with them in the past, but it&#8217;s been more sporadic and usually at their annual meeting.</p>



<p>This, I think, stands out as an effort to engage with them, you know, outside of this sort of structure of their annual meeting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And then he&#8217;s going to Honolulu where he&#8217;ll meet with his Korean and Japanese counterparts in a trilateral, which, again, this is something that we&#8217;ve done before but, you know, we&#8217;re basically touching three different parts of Asia that sort of &#8212; the Quad, the traditional Northeast Asia, and then obviously the Pacific.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re doing that at a time when there are immense pressures and demands elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I think that reflects the fact that the administration recognizes the importance of sustained engagement in the region, also recognizes that the United States doesn&#8217;t have the luxury to only focus on one region or one problem at a time.</p>



<p>In terms of Russia: I think that, you know, this is not explicitly about Russia.&nbsp; You know, if you look carefully what&#8217;s there, I mean, this is about enduring &#8212; an enduring U.S. vision for how we engage with the region.&nbsp; But we believe that the basic principles we articulate here about freedom of choice, about the ability of countries to chart their own paths are very, very relevant to the current situation.&nbsp; And they reflect an articulation of longstanding U.S views and also the importance we place on working in collaboration with close partners and building &#8212; helping the region strengthen its own resiliency.</p>



<p>And I would just note: We see ourselves as part of that region.&nbsp; And so, we see some of the efforts that we&#8217;ve done to strengthen ourselves as being part of strengthening the region’s resilience.</p>



<p>So, hopefully that gives you at least something of what you need.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Inaudible) about the importance of the Indo-Pacific economic framework and the reactions in the region &#8212; a lot of countries, Japan included, had urged the U.S. to rejoin the Trans-Pacific Partnership, or now the CPTPP &#8212; and whether the framework is enough, or whether this is a disappointment to allies in the region?&nbsp; And it looks for something that was going to work on not only issues like digital and labor, but also market access and a much more comprehensive reintegration or framework &#8212; a little more comprehensive tie into the region.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Totally appreciate your question.&nbsp; I think &#8212; well, a couple of things.&nbsp; I think, one, you can see that one of the pillars of the strategy is to promote shared prosperity.&nbsp; I think we, you know, want to make clear we believe the U.S. is already very engaged economically in the region.&nbsp; We&#8217;re the largest outside investor.&nbsp; We have extensive trade that supports millions of jobs in the United States as well as in other countries in the Indo-Pacific.&nbsp; We believe this is something that is, you know, very fundamental to our engagement with the region.</p>



<p>We also recognize that the region wants to see further U.S. economic engagement.&nbsp; I think that, you know, we have worked closely with key &#8212; our partners as we have been developing the Indo-Pacific economic framework.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I would note that &#8212; you know, watch this space on more details there.&nbsp; This is coming out, but I think you&#8217;ll be seeing relatively, you know, in your future as you can &#8212; as I&#8217;m &#8212; you&#8217;re no doubt aware, the, you know, further details on the Indo-Pacific economic framework.</p>



<p>But I think that, you know, we recognize that countries want to see more.&nbsp; We also recognize that, you know, some of the challenges that we&#8217;re dealing with today and that have really been highlighted in the pandemic &#8212; and, in particular, supply chain disruptions &#8212; are not things that are addressed by some of the traditional framework.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So we think that there is demand for quite a few of these elements.&nbsp; And I think that, you know, the &#8212; our partners are very realistic about the constraints and challenges in which we operate and the President&#8217;s views on this.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the same time &#8212; I just want to be very clear &#8212; we recognize that we need to be engaged economically, and we need to find ways to strengthen and expand our economic engagement in order to be successful.&nbsp; I think that the framework will do this.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I think that our, at least initial, impression is: Yes, you know, there are many countries that have expectations about what they would like to see, but, you know, I think they are all very realistic and recognize that what we are doing is a reflection of our having heard them and our engaging with them to try and address as many of those concerns as we believe are appropriate.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; Thanks, [senior administration official].&nbsp; And thank you, everyone, for joining.</p>



<p>As a reminder, this call was on background, attributable to “senior administration officials.”&nbsp; The contents of the call are embargoed until 3:00 p.m. Eastern.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You also have an embargoed copy of the factsheet and the strategy in your inboxes.&nbsp; If you did not receive it, you can email me or NSC Press.&nbsp; And just, you know, again, those products are also embargoed until 3:00 p.m. Eastern today.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thanks for your time, and have a good rest of your day.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/U.S.-Indo-Pacific-Strategy.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Read the full strategy here</a></p>



<p class="has-text-align-right"><em>“We envision an Indo-Pacific that is open, connected, prosperous, resilient, and secure—and we are ready to work together with each of you to achieve it.”</em><br><em>President Joe Biden</em><br><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; East Asia Summit</em><br><em>October 27, 2021</em></p>



<p>The Biden-Harris Administration has made historic strides to restore American leadership in the Indo-Pacific and adapt its role for the 21<sup>st</sup> century. In the last year, the United States has modernized its longstanding alliances, strengthened emerging partnerships, and forged innovative links among them to meet urgent challenges, from competition with China to climate change to the pandemic. It has done so at a time when allies and partners around the world are increasingly enhancing their own engagement in the Indo-Pacific; and when there is broad, bipartisan agreement in the U.S. Congress that the United States must, too. This convergence in commitment to the region, across oceans and across political-party lines, reflects an undeniable reality: the Indo-Pacific is the most dynamic region in the world, and its future affects people everywhere.<br><br>That reality is the basis of the Indo-Pacific Strategy of the United States. This strategy outlines President Biden’s vision to more firmly anchor the United States in the Indo-Pacific and strengthen the region in the process. Its central focus is sustained and creative collaboration with allies, partners, and institutions, within the region and beyond it.<br><br>The United States will pursue an Indo-Pacific region that is:</p>



<ol><li><strong><em>FREE AND OPEN</em></strong></li></ol>



<p>Our vital interests and those of our closest partners require a free and open Indo-Pacific, and a free and open Indo-Pacific requires that governments can make their own choices and that shared domains are governed lawfully. Our strategy begins with strengthening resilience, both within individual countries, as we have done in the United States, and among them. We will advance a free and open region, including by:</p>



<ul><li><em>Investing in democratic institutions, a free press, and a vibrant civil society</em></li><li><em>Improving fiscal transparency in the Indo-Pacific to expose corruption and drive reform</em></li><li><em>Ensuring the region’s seas and skies are governed and used according to international law</em></li><li><em>Advancing common approaches to critical and emerging technologies, the internet, and cyber space</em></li></ul>



<ol><li><strong><em>CONNECTED</em></strong></li></ol>



<p>A free and open Indo-Pacific can only be achieved if we build collective capacity for a new age. The alliances, organizations, and rules that the United States and its partners have helped to build must be adapted. We will build collective capacity within and beyond the region, including by:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><em>Deepening our five regional treaty alliances with Australia, Japan, the Republic of Korea (ROK), the Philippines, and Thailand</em></li><li><em>Strengthening relationships with leading regional partners, including India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mongolia, New Zealand, Singapore, Taiwan, Vietnam, and the Pacific Islands</em></li><li><em>Contributing to an empowered and unified ASEAN</em></li><li><em>Strengthening the Quad and delivering on its commitments</em></li><li><em>Supporting India’s continued rise and regional leadership</em></li><li><em>Partnering to build resilience in the Pacific Islands</em></li><li><em>Forging connections between the Indo-Pacific and the Euro-Atlantic</em></li><li><em>Expanding U.S. diplomatic presence in the Indo-Pacific, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands</em></li></ul>



<ol><li><strong><em>PROSPEROUS</em></strong></li></ol>



<p>The prosperity of everyday Americans is linked to the Indo-Pacific. That fact requires investments to encourage innovation, strengthen economic competitiveness, produce good-paying jobs, rebuild supply chains, and expand economic opportunities for middle-class families: 1.5 billion people in the Indo-Pacific will join the global middle class this decade. We will drive Indo-Pacific prosperity, including by:</p>



<ul><li><em>Proposing an Indo-Pacific economic framework, through which we will</em>:<ul><li><em>Develop new approaches to trade that meet high labor and environmental standards</em></li><li><em>Govern our digital economies and cross-border data flows according to open principles, including through a new digital economy framework</em></li><li><em>Advance resilient and secure supply chains that are diverse, open, and predictable</em></li><li><em>Make shared investments in decarbonization and clean energy</em></li></ul></li><li><em>Promoting free, fair, and open trade and investment through the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), including in our 2023 host year</em></li><li><em>Closing the region’s infrastructure gap through Build Back Better World with G7 partners</em></li></ul>



<ol><li><strong><em>SECURE</em></strong></li></ol>



<p>For 75 years, the United States has maintained a strong and consistent defense presence necessary to support regional peace, security, stability, and prosperity. We are extending and modernizing that role and enhancing our capabilities to defend our interests and to deter aggression against U.S. territory and against our allies and partners. We will bolster Indo-Pacific security, drawing on all instruments of power to deter aggression and to counter coercion, including by:</p>



<ul><li><em>Advancing integrated deterrence</em></li><li><em>Deepening cooperation and enhancing interoperability with allies and partners</em></li><li><em>Maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait</em></li><li><em>Innovating to operate in rapidly evolving threat environments, including space, cyberspace, and critical- and emerging-technology areas</em></li><li><em>Strengthening extended deterrence and coordination with our ROK and Japanese allies and pursuing the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula</em></li><li><em>Continuing to deliver on AUKUS</em></li><li><em>Expanding U.S. Coast Guard presence and cooperation against other transnational threats</em></li><li><em>Working with Congress to fund the Pacific Deterrence Initiative and the Maritime Security Initiative</em></li></ul>



<ol><li><strong><em>RESILIENT</em></strong></li></ol>



<p>The Indo-Pacific faces major transnational challenges. Climate change is growing ever-more severe as South Asia’s glaciers melt and the Pacific Islands battle existential rises in sea levels. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to inflict a painful human and economic toll across the region. And Indo-Pacific governments grapple with natural disasters, resource scarcity, internal conflict, and governance challenges. Left unchecked, these forces threaten to destabilize the region. We will build regional resilience to 21<sup>st</sup>-century transnational threats, including by:</p>



<ul><li><em>Working with allies and partners to develop 2030 and 2050 targets, strategies, plans, and policies consistent with limiting global temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius</em></li><li><em>Reducing regional vulnerability to the impacts of climate change and environmental degradation</em></li><li><em>Ending the COVID-19 pandemic and bolstering global health security</em></li></ul>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Via Teleconference</p>



<p>9:06 A.M. EST</p>



<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MODERATOR:&nbsp; Thanks, everyone, for joining.&nbsp; So, today we&#8217;re doing a background press call on the U.S.’s support for the people of Afghanistan.&nbsp; This call is on background, attributable to “senior administration officials.”&nbsp; And the contents of this call are embargoed until the end of the call.</p>



<p>For your awareness but not for reporting, our speakers today are [senior administration official] and [senior administration official].</p>



<p>With that, I will turn it over to [senior administration official] to get us started.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; Thanks so much.&nbsp; And now thanks for joining &#8212; joining this call today to all of you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We&#8217;re here today to talk about a number of our lines of effort to address the ongoing economic and humanitarian situation in Afghanistan, but principally to preview an executive order that the President is signing, sort of, imminently, as we&#8217;re talking, and it will be out at the end of this call, related to the disposition of Afghan’s central bank, or DAB, reserves held in the United States.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let me start with some quick background that may be familiar to a couple of you.&nbsp; When Kabul fell to the Taliban, Afghanistan had over $9 billion in reserves held in the name of the DAB, or the central bank, outside of Afghanistan.&nbsp; And this included $7 billion in reserves held in the United States, with the rest of the reserves largely being in Germany, UAE, Switzerland, and a couple of other states.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The source of these reserves &#8212; fundamentally, these reserves, including the $7 billion in the U.S., are fundamentally kind of the proceeds of the sustained and significant international assistance that the United States and other international donors gave to Afghanistan over the past two decades.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over the past several months, the administration has been exploring potential avenues to enable some of these assets to be freed up to support the needs of the Afghan people without providing the Taliban access to the assets while also taking into account ongoing litigation by U.S. terrorism victims who have legal judgments and legal claims against the Taliban, including victims of the 9/11 terrorist attacks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This morning, Biden &#8212; President Biden has signed an executive order that is blocking the property of the DAB, of the Afghan central bank, held in the U.S. by U.S. financial institutions, and is requiring that property to be transferred into a consolidated account held at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.</p>



<p>We are then going to seek to facilitate access of $3.5 billion, or slightly under &#8212; just under half of the assets &#8212; for the benefit of the Afghan people and for Afghanistan&#8217;s future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I want to say, to be very clear, that this &#8212; what we&#8217;re talking about today is a process step and a step in a process that might lead to the unlocking of these funds for the benefit of the Afghan people.&nbsp; Because as many of you know, and as I just discussed, a number of U.S. victims of terrorism, including the 9/11 &#8212; some of the 9/11 victims’ families, brought claims against the Taliban.&nbsp; And a number of those claimants are pursuing access to the DAB funds, the Afghan central bank funds, in federal court.</p>



<p>Because some of the plaintiffs &#8212; some of the U.S. plaintiffs currently have writs of attachment against the DAB assets, the court in New York is going to need to issue a further decision regarding the scope of those writs and to authorize any transfer of the funds for the benefit of the Afghan people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And even if $3.5 billion of funds are transferred for the benefit of the Afghan people, more than $3.5 billion &#8212; just over half &#8212; of the DAB assets will remain in the United States, will be subject to ongoing litigation by U.S. victims of terrorism.&nbsp; And the U.S. claimants here are going to have a full opportunity to have their claims heard in U.S. courts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just to emphasize again: This is one step forward in a process, and no funds are going to be transferred until the court makes a ruling.&nbsp; We&#8217;re going to use the next several months while the court is working &#8212; while this is working its way through the court in New York to set up a trust fund &#8212; a third-party trust fund &#8212; which will administer the $3.5 billion we’re seeking to transfer, and ensure that that money is used for the benefit of the Afghan people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We&#8217;re still working through the modalities of that trust fund and the governance structure of that trust fund, as well as the specific uses of the funds.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re going to take a couple of months here to do that, because we think it&#8217;s very important to be able to consult widely with our international partners and allies, and with experts on Afghanistan, for how to appropriately use those funds while ensuring that no benefits &#8212; so that they benefit the Afghan people while ensuring no benefit goes directly to the Taliban.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We expect that, ultimately, the resources will be &#8212; will be deployed, as I say, for the benefit of the Afghan people, while minimizing and ensuring that they are not a direct benefit to the Taliban.&nbsp; And we’re also going to ensure that there are going to be appropriate controls in place over these funds to prevent diversion and illicit activity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I do want to emphasize that the &#8212; a couple of things about our decision here.&nbsp; The first I&#8217;d note is that this approach that we&#8217;re taking heeds bipartisan calls from Congress to use the reserves to mitigate the serious and ongoing crisis in Afghanistan while at the same time recognizing the importance of ongoing efforts by victims of terrorism and their families, including victims of the 9/11 attacks, to pursue other claims in court.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We also &#8212; this action is intended to provide a path forward for the assets to reach and benefit the Afghan people, keeping them out of the hands of the Taliban and other malicious actors.</p>



<p>And I do want to actually make one additional point there, because I think some of the early reporting on this issue has mischaracterized how these funds are going to be used.&nbsp; As I said, we are going to be setting up a trust fund and consulting widely with our allies and partners on both the governance of the fund and the use.&nbsp; And we&#8217;ve not made specific decisions about how the funds will be used.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Obviously, this trust fund, based on the DAB reserves, you know, could be &#8212; would be separate from and distinct from the U.S. government dollars that we are currently using to provide humanitarian assistance to the Afghan people that my colleague can speak about &#8212; can speak about in more detail.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We do think that this executive order will help preserve a substantial portion of these reserves for the benefit of the Afghan people while understanding that there are no easy solutions for the current economic challenges that we see in Afghanistan, which have been exacerbated by the Taliban’s takeover of the country.</p>



<p>I think I&#8217;m going to leave it there and turn it over to [senior administration official] for a few opening remarks, and then we&#8217;ll take some questions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over to you.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Thanks very much.&nbsp; Let me just start by underscoring a couple of the points that [senior administration official] has made about this transfer being a multi-step process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are still several different things that need to occur across the U.S. government.&nbsp; The U.S. Treasury Department will need to provide a license to authorize transfer of funds for the benefit of the Afghan people.&nbsp; The Federal Reserve Bank would conduct its standard due diligence processes with respect to any transfer.&nbsp; As you heard earlier, the third party that would administer these funds and their allowable uses &#8212; this mechanism is being studied, still needs to be determined.&nbsp; The administration is working through these questions as we undertake this action.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And as you&#8217;ve also heard, this action and funds that could be made available would be separate and distinct from U.S. bilateral humanitarian assistance.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve talked about our humanitarian assistance efforts, but I just wanted to go through some of the highlights while, again, underscoring that this is distinct from the effort that we&#8217;re discussing today.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As many of you are aware, the United States remains the largest single donor of humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan.&nbsp; Last month, the U.S. announced a new contribution of $308 million in humanitarian assistance for the people of Afghanistan.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve provided more than $516 million since August.</p>



<p>And this humanitarian assistance, our bilateral assistance, flows through independent humanitarian organizations.&nbsp; It helps provide lifesaving protection and shelter and healthcare, winterization assistance, emergency food aid, and other urgent needs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The United States has also recently provided the people of Afghanistan with 1 million additional COVID-19 vaccine doses through COVAX, and that brings our total donation of vaccines to Afghanistan to 4.3 million doses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In December, the United States led efforts in New York to create a new Security Council resolution that would establish a carve-out for humanitarian assistance and activities that support basic human needs &#8212; the carve-out to the United Nations 1988 sanctions regime.&nbsp; Again, all of this to enable the continued provision of humanitarian assistance…</p>



<p>At the same time, the Treasury Department issued additional licenses to make sure that it was very clear what actions are still permissible.&nbsp; And the Department of the Treasury have provided broad authorizations, really since September, to ensure that it&#8217;s clear that aid organizations, NGOs, other international organizations can continue their lifesaving work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We&#8217;re working closely with the U.N. on the World Bank’s</p>



<p>transferring out of substantial funds from the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund to U.N. organizations.&nbsp; There was a $280 million tranche that was provided to the U.N.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re very proud to be the largest funder of U.N. operations in Afghanistan.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All of these efforts underscore the complications of getting assistance directly to the Afghan people without benefiting the Taliban.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I will stop there.</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Great, thank you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Operator, could you please queue up the directions to ask a question please?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey, guys, thanks for doing this.&nbsp; I was wondering if you could just talk about what the legal justification in the executive order is.&nbsp; I know that there has been talk that it could be a provision of IEEPA or the Federal Reserve Act, and so, what you settled on there.&nbsp;&nbsp; And then maybe talk through to what extent the concern that this action would make other governments, considering parking assets in the U.S. in the future, take pause since this is sort of, kind of, a unique and unprecedented step.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Those are my two.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Yeah, no, I think they’re both &#8212; both great questions.&nbsp; On the first one: So, the executive order is going to be issued pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act &#8212; IEEPA.&nbsp; You&#8217;ll see it post I think, basically, at the end of this call; it’s scheduled to go up at 9:30.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s a statute that is, you know, regularly used in a broad number of different contexts in order to, you know, freeze &#8212; freeze assets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Obviously, this context is, in certain ways, unique.&nbsp; And, you know, we think that this is an appropriate way to kind of freeze the funds in place and ultimately &#8212; you know, again, if a court allows us &#8212; be able to move some of them to a trust fund for the benefit of the Afghan people.</p>



<p>I will say that, legally, you know, this is a complex set of issues, because we obviously have the executive order part of it.&nbsp; We have &#8212; or we’re working with &#8212; you know, we’re &#8212; there’s obviously the court case in New York.&nbsp; We also have had to identify, you know, other mechanisms &#8212; or sort of related mechanisms beyond the executive order to get the Federal Reserve to a place where it could &#8212; again, if allowed by the court &#8212; actually release the funds into our planned trust fund.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So I would say this has been quite a legally complicated road.&nbsp; I think what we would say about it is, you know, we think it is very important both to be able to, you know, take $3.5 billion here and ensure that those will be used for the benefit of the Afghan people &#8212; and I think we&#8217;ve identified a legal mechanism to do that &#8212; while also ensuring that the U.S. plaintiffs, you know, have a chance to have their day in court and to have their case heard in court.&nbsp; So it&#8217;s been a legally complicated road to get there.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t want to, you know, walk you through every sort of detail of the dozens &#8212; or hundreds of hours of legal work, I think, that we&#8217;ve put in this.&nbsp; But I do think we feel comfortable &#8212; quite comfortable that we have acted consistently and are acting consistently, obviously, with U.S. law.</p>



<p>On the broader risk: I mean, look, I think this is an unprecedented situation.&nbsp; We have $7 billion of assets in the United States that are owned by a country where there is no government that we recognize &#8212; there&#8217;s no government recognized.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think, you know, we are acting responsibly to ensure that a portion of that money can be used to benefit the people of the country &#8212; of the country, you know, where this money &#8212; you know, for where this money was given, right?&nbsp; This is ultimately charitable proceeds.&nbsp; I think we&#8217;re acting responsibly to ensure that these proceeds of international donations can be used to benefit the Afghan people.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re also acting responsibly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You know, we have an independent judiciary and legal system here.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re acting responsibly so that U.S. claimants who have, you know, claims that they have brought into court have a chance to have their day in court.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, I actually think international partners will look at this as us acting very responsibly to kind of deal within our legal system and the purposes &#8212; the original purposes of this money to help effect that those purposes are served.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, thanks for doing this call.&nbsp; I guess my question is similar to Justin&#8217;s, but rather than the legal justification, I kind of want to want to know: How would you respond to criticism or, I guess, moral justification that since this money does not belong to the Taliban, but actually to the Afghan people who were arguably, by and large, not involved in the 9/11 attacks &#8212; so, why should the people of Afghanistan pay for the price &#8212; pay the price for these attacks?&nbsp; Thanks.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; So, what I would &#8212; I would say here is: Look, you know, as I just said, we have a &#8212; obviously, as you all know, we have an independent judiciary.&nbsp; We have, you know, people &#8212; U.S. terrorism victims who have claims against the Taliban, who have claims in court, who have, as I said at the beginning, actually obtained a writ against the funds at the Federal Reserve.&nbsp; I think that, you know, their claims &#8212; I&#8217;m not an expert in, kind of, their claims; I think that those are complicated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But these &#8212; you know, they have, and a judge has already given, a writ in our system in order to freeze those funds in place so that these claimants can have their case heard.&nbsp; And I think that &#8212; you know, consistent with our country&#8217;s law and values &#8212; when somebody thinks that they have a legitimate claim and a good judge is hearing that and freezing some of the funds, that&#8217;s obviously something we have to &#8212; we have to take seriously.&nbsp; I think what we have done today &#8212; and we think, you know, should be taken seriously.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think what we&#8217;ve done today is tried to take a step to ensure that while that litigation is playing out, while those claimants are having their day in court, we are also &#8212; which, you know, could take quite some time ultimately.&nbsp; We are also taking steps to ensure that, you know, $3.5 billion here can be transferred to a trust fund &#8212; again, with the court&#8217;s permission to be used for the benefit of the Afghan people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, what I would hope people would say is that we are doing &#8212; we are taking a step to try to make sure that, you know, some of this money can be used for the benefit of the Afghan people while respecting the legal process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have one other note on that.&nbsp; I’d note that &#8212; you know, we talked about the $7 billion in the U.S.; there are $2 billion of Afghan reserves outside the U.S. held in other countries.&nbsp; I would note: I believe the U.S. is the first and only country that is holding any of the Afghan reserves, that is taking any step to try to free them up for the benefit of the Afghan people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so, I’d also sort of ask, you know, people who look at what we&#8217;re doing to maybe &#8212; and sort of appreciate what we&#8217;re doing &#8212; to maybe, you know, turn to some of the other countries to see if maybe they&#8217;d be able to take a step similar to what we&#8217;re doing, given that, as I said, I think we’re the only country to take any efforts to try to make these &#8212; some of these funds available for the benefit of the Afghan people.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, hello.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Some countries &#8212; South Korea and others &#8212; have tried to unfreeze assets, but the understanding has been that the United States has asked them not to.&nbsp; Will you expect that others will then move to take care of this?</p>



<p>And on where the assets come from, is that all aid money?&nbsp; Wasn’t it &#8212; isn’t it money from Afghan exports and other transactions by the Afghan government that legitimately belonged to them that was not specifically foreign assistance?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; So, on the &#8212; on the question that you just raised &#8212; the second question you raised, Karen: So, you know, it&#8217;s hard to trace &#8212; believe me, we’ve tried it &#8212; it&#8217;s hard to trace, sort of, a specific dollar of reserves to a specific &#8212; you know, a specific transaction.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But what we broadly assess is that if you look at the kind of budget of the Afghan government, where the Afghan government got its revenues &#8212; and these are ultimately, like, the proceeds of the Afghan government revenues &#8212; it was something north of 80 percent coming from foreign assistance dollars.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, I think &#8212; you know, again, not being able to trace every dollar &#8212; we feel confident that the overwhelming majority of these funds are the proceeds of international assistance.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In terms of unblocking assets, you know, I would say we have, I think, been clear in our engagement with allies and partners, both &#8212; and publicly and with, you know, NGOs and others.&nbsp; Look, you know, the Taliban is subject to sanctions; a number of individual Taliban officials are subject to sanctions.&nbsp; But as you have seen, we have been issuing licenses to try to ensure that sanctions are not impeding, you know, humanitarian and other key activities in Afghanistan.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I think, you know, we have been having conversations with other governments about, you know, ways in which they can take steps in order to make sure that sanctions aren’t standing in the way of addressing the situation in Afghanistan.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I’d also just note: Here, obviously, we are talking about, you know, central bank reserves, and that might be different from &#8212; which are owned by the state &#8212; and that might be different from, you know, assets that are frozen that were held by individuals or particular companies.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey, guys.&nbsp; Thanks for doing this.&nbsp; Can I just ask some pointed questions, frankly, from both sides of the argument?&nbsp; This is &#8212; a form of this has already been asked, but there are those who are arguing that you are using the court case as a shield to &#8212; and that you should be able to send all of this money back to Afghanistan, given the absolute catastrophic humanitarian condition in which parents are selling their own children, so how can you not give more money to the people of Afghanistan.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the other side of the argument is: Yes, you will try to avoid supporting the Taliban, but the reality is that any success in preventing a humanitarian crisis will be the Taliban’s success, the Taliban will inevitably siphon off money, even that goes through NGOs.&nbsp; So, if you could answer those, kind of, pointed questions.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Yeah, so, first of all, I’d say: We have in no way been using or no way think of ourselves as using the court case as a shield.&nbsp; I mean, the first thing I’d note is, like, these &#8212; as I said, these funds are currently subject to a writ of attachment.&nbsp; And actually, no distribution of the funds at all, of any kind, can happen without the authorization of the court in New York that&#8217;s hearing the claims against the Taliban.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, sort of an idea that &#8212; some idea that we could just, you know, ignore the &#8212; you know, ignore the litigation in New York is just flatly wrong.&nbsp; I mean, we have &#8212; we have to deal with it; they have a writ of attachment.&nbsp; We also think it is important that Americans have their ability to be heard in court.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What I would say to the Americans who are having their day heard in court is: You know, if we are able to move this money into an international trust fund, we are going to be ensuring that there are very robust controls in place, so this is not going to be going to the Taliban; it’s going to be being used for the benefit of the Afghan people.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I&#8217;d note that, you know, there are still going to be slightly over $3.5 billion &#8212; again, assuming the court lets us act here &#8212; to be able to be &#8212; you know, for them to be able to have their day in court.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You know, in terms of the, kind of, immediate crisis &#8212; look, because we have to go through a judicial process here, it is going to be at least a number of months before we can move any of this money, right?&nbsp; So this money isn&#8217;t going to be available over the next couple of months regardless &#8212; so, regardless of amount, regardless of what we might want to do.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I think that is why you heard [senior administration official] talk so much about what are the dollars we as the U.S. government are providing, including more than $500 million just since August, to address the humanitarian needs of the Afghan people.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so, what I would want to convey to the people of Afghanistan is: Look, we are trying to take some of this money to put in trust for the benefit of the Afghan people.&nbsp; We, as the American government, are also spending from our own taxpayer dollars &#8212; you know, just since August, more than $500 million &#8212; to address the immediate humanitarian needs, you know, even as we have to go through quite some lengthy process in order to get some of these reserves put into a trust for the benefit of the Afghan people.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey, thanks.&nbsp; Thanks so much for doing this.&nbsp; I just wanted to, kind of, like re- &#8212; I guess, go &#8212; kind of related to some of the earlier questions.&nbsp; You had mentioned how international partners would see this.&nbsp; I wanted to ask how extensively have you consulted with outside partners, international allies, also international group &#8212; who may be, you know, helping distribute some of these funds &#8212; about this plan to kind of hold back half of the money and potentially use it for resources in the United States, which were not the original intentions.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Well, so, I’d start, again, with the point I made earlier, which is there are $2 billion in Afghan central bank funds held in, you know, countries like Germany and the UK.&nbsp; And I&#8217;m not aware that any of those countries have taken any efforts at all to &#8212; so far, at least to the extent we have &#8212; in order to try to, you know, make some of those funds available for the benefit of the Afghan people.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, I think &#8212; you know, as I said earlier, I think allies and partners will understand and see that we are doing, within our legal system, what we can, in a way that other countries are not, in order to make some of these funds available for the benefit of the Afghan people.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also think countries understand.&nbsp; Look, you know, whether these claimants in the U.S. have a legal right to these funds, that&#8217;s a very complicated issue under legal &#8212; you know, under U.S. law.&nbsp; They&#8217;ve obviously got, you know, enough of a &#8212; enough substance to convince a court to put a writ of attachment on the funds.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think our allies and partners, you know, fully understand we have an independent judiciary that Americans have the right to bring claims; they have the right, and it&#8217;s important that they have the right to have their claims heard in court.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, again, I think we have discussed what we&#8217;re doing with our key allies and partners.&nbsp; We have &#8212; we have had those discussions.&nbsp; And I think our allies and partners are going to, you know, as I say, understand that we have a legal system; within our legal system, we are trying to make sure that, again, unlike other countries, we are moving to unblock funds, to make them available for the benefit of the Afghan people, while also respecting we have U.S. claimants who I think have &#8212; you know, have to have their day and their right to be heard in court.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; And another point on the additional countries that hold reserves: We&#8217;ve been in close contact with them.&nbsp; They&#8217;re also facing a number of their own legal challenges.&nbsp; This is a complicated situation for &#8212; it&#8217;s not the exact same kind of legal challenge, but they have their own sort of regulations and things they need to work through in their systems.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, it&#8217;s been a complicated question for each of the countries.&nbsp; But we are in touch and will remain in touch as we take this action.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other point, in terms of international coordination: We are in close touch, and there&#8217;s a long history of close donor coordination with so many countries that have worked together over many years to support Afghanistan and the Afghan people.&nbsp; And we fully anticipate that there will be significant, sort of, multilateral components to a mechanism that is built to determine the disposition of these funds.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Thank you guys so much.&nbsp; Now, this is a complicated issue &#8212; a complicated issue for reporting, I know, because there are just a lot of ins and outs.&nbsp; And so, I really appreciate you guys taking the time with us this morning.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And please reach out to [moderator] if you have any follow-up questions.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MODERATOR:&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; Thanks, [senior administration official].&nbsp; Thanks, everyone, for joining.&nbsp; The embargo is lifted.&nbsp; If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out.&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; Have a good day.<br><br>9:36 A.M. EST</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50&nbsp;U.S.C. 1701 <em>et seq</em>.) (IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 <em>et seq</em>.) (NEA), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code,</p>



<p>I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, find that the widespread humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan &#8212; including the urgent needs of the people of Afghanistan for food security, livelihoods support, water, sanitation, health, hygiene, shelter and settlement assistance,&nbsp;and COVID-19-related assistance, among other basic human needs &#8212; and the potential for a deepening economic collapse in Afghanistan constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United&nbsp;States. &nbsp;I hereby declare a national emergency to deal with that threat. &nbsp;In addition, I find that the preservation of certain property of Da Afghanistan Bank (DAB) held in the United&nbsp;States by United States financial institutions is of the utmost importance to addressing this national emergency and the welfare of the people of Afghanistan.&nbsp; I also understand that various parties, including representatives of victims of terrorism, have asserted legal claims against certain property of DAB or indicated in public court filings an intent to make such claims.&nbsp; This property is blocked under this order.</p>



<p>Accordingly, I hereby order:</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Section 1.</span>  (a)  All property and interests in property of DAB that are held, as of the date of this order, in the United States by any United States financial institution, including the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, are blocked and may not be transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or otherwise dealt in, except as set forth in subsections (b) and (c) of this section.<br>     (b)  United States financial institutions shall promptly transfer the blocked property described in subsection (a) of this section into a consolidated account held at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.<br>     (c)  The prohibitions in subsection (a) of this section apply except to the extent provided by statutes, or in regulations, orders, directives, or licenses that may be issued pursuant to this order, and notwithstanding any contract entered into or any license or permit granted before the date of this order.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 2.</span>  This order and actions taken pursuant to this order shall apply notwithstanding any previously issued Executive Order to the extent such order blocks, regulates, or otherwise affects the property and interests in property identified in section 1(a) of this order.  This order and actions taken pursuant to this order shall supersede any previously issued Executive Order to the extent such order blocks, regulates, or otherwise affects the property and interests in property identified in section 1(a) of this order.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 3.</span>  (a)  Any transaction that evades or avoids, has the purpose of evading or avoiding, causes a violation of, or attempts to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited.<br>     (b)  Any conspiracy formed to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 4.</span>  For the purposes of this order:<br>     (a)  the term &#8220;Da Afghanistan Bank&#8221; or &#8220;DAB&#8221; means the Central Bank of Afghanistan;<br>     (b)  the term &#8220;entity&#8221; means a partnership, association, trust, joint venture, corporation, group, subgroup, or other organization; and<br>     (c)  the term &#8220;person&#8221; means an individual or entity.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 5.</span> For those persons whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order who might have a constitutional presence in the United States, I find that because of the ability to transfer funds and other assets instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of measures to be taken pursuant to this order would render those measures ineffectual.  I therefore determine that for these measures to be effective in addressing the national emergency declared in this order, there need be no prior notice of the blocking of property and interests in property set forth in section 1(a) of this order.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 6.</span>  The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Attorney General, is authorized to take such actions, including the promulgation of rules and regulations, and to employ all powers granted to the President by IEEPA as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this order.  The Secretary of the Treasury may, consistent with applicable law, redelegate any of these functions within the Department of the Treasury.  All executive departments and agencies of the United States shall take all appropriate measures within their authority to implement this order.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 7.</span>  Nothing in this order shall prohibit transactions for the conduct of the official business of the Federal Government by employees, grantees, and contractors thereof.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 8.</span>  The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, is authorized to submit recurring and final reports to the Congress on the national emergency declared in this order, consistent with section 401(c) of the NEA (50 U.S.C. 1641(c)) and section 204(c) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1703(c)).</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 9.</span>  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:<br>          (i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or<br>          (ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.<br>     (b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.<br>     (c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.</p>

<p>As part of our ongoing work to address the humanitarian and economic crisis in Afghanistan, President Biden signed an Executive Order (E.O.) to help enable certain U.S.-based assets belonging to Afghanistan’s central bank, Da Afghanistan Bank (“DAB”), to be used to benefit the Afghan people. The E.O. will block property of DAB held in the United States by U.S. financial institutions and require U.S. financial institutions to transfer this property into a consolidated account held at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The Administration will seek to facilitate access to $3.5 billion of those assets for the benefit of the Afghan people and for Afghanistan’s future pending a judicial decision.</p>



<p>Many U.S. victims of terrorism, including relatives of victims who died in the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, have brought claims against the Taliban and are pursuing DAB assets in federal court. Because some of these plaintiffs currently have writs of execution against the DAB assets, the court will need to issue a further decision regarding the scope of those writs. Even if funds are transferred for the benefit of the Afghan people, more than $3.5 billion in DAB assets would remain in the United States and are subject to ongoing litigation by U.S. victims of terrorism. Plaintiffs will have a full opportunity to have their claims heard in court.</p>



<p>This is one step forward in the United States’ effort to authorize the transfer of a significant portion of the funds to meet the needs of the Afghan people. The E.O. is designed to provide a path for the funds to reach the people of Afghanistan, while keeping them out of the hands of the Taliban and malicious actors. The United States has sanctions in place against the Taliban and the Haqqani network, including for activities that threaten the safety of Americans such as holding our citizens hostage.</p>



<p>While this E.O. will help preserve a substantial portion of Afghanistan’s reserves to benefit the Afghan people, we understand there are no easy solutions for Afghanistan’s economic challenges, which have been exacerbated by the Taliban’s forced takeover of the country:</p>



<ul><li>Even prior to the events of last August, Afghanistan’s economy was on the brink. Afghanistan faced poverty rates above 50 percent. International donor grants financed about 75 percent of public expenditures and 50 percent of the government’s budget. A two-year long drought had reduced many crops to 40 percent of their usual yields, and Afghanistan had one of the least developed financial systems in the world—with just 10-20% of adults holding bank accounts. Rampant corruption crippled sectors that should have been profitable.</li></ul>



<ul><li>The Taliban’s forced takeover made the already frail economic situation worse. The IMF estimates that Afghanistan faces an economic contraction of 30%, and many of the senior officials and technical experts needed to provide sound economic management have fled the country as a result of the Taliban’s actions.</li></ul>



<ul><li>These problems reflect longstanding, structural issues that predated the events of August 2021 and have worsened due to uncertainty and perceived risk surrounding the Taliban’s capacity to run the economy. This includes its ability to implement anti-money laundering measures and measures to counter the financing of terrorism.</li></ul>



<p>Against this challenging backdrop, the United States will continue to work tirelessly with the international community to ensure that humanitarian assistance and other support flows to the people of Afghanistan. Over the past several months, we have acted urgently to support the Afghan people:</p>



<ul><li>The United States remains the single largest donor of humanitarian aid in Afghanistan. Just last month, the United States announced a new contribution of more than $308 million in humanitarian assistance for the people of Afghanistan and we have provided more than $516 million since mid-August. The humanitarian assistance flows through independent humanitarian organizations and helps provide lifesaving protection and shelter, essential health care, winterization assistance, emergency food aid, water, sanitation, and hygiene services in response to the growing humanitarian needs exacerbated by COVID-19 and healthcare shortages, drought, malnutrition, and the winter season.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul><li>The United States recently provided the people of Afghanistan with one million additional COVID-19 vaccine doses through COVAX, bringing our total donation to 4.3 million doses.</li><li>In December 2021, the United Nations Security Council adopted a resolution championed by the United States to establish a carveout for humanitarian assistance and activities that support basic human needs in the UN 1988 sanctions regime to ensure that urgently needed aid can reach the Afghan people. The United States is also collaborating closely with the United Nations on mechanisms to ensure UN agencies and NGOs have the liquidity needed to support critical humanitarian assistance programs.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Starting in September 2021, the Department of the Treasury has provided broad authorizations that facilitate the continued provision of aid and support to the Afghan people by NGOs, international organizations, and the U.S. government. In December, the World Food Program, with USAID support, reached 8 million people across Afghanistan with food assistance. This was facilitated by licenses that the U.S. Treasury Department has issued.</li><li>The United States worked closely with the United Nations on the World Bank’s “transfer out” of $280 million in funds from the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF) to UN Organizations. We are proud to be the largest funder of UN operations in Afghanistan and the leading donor to the ARTF.</li></ul>



<p>The United States is committed to supporting the Afghan people and we continue to consider all options available to us to achieve that goal.</p>

<p>The United States and France are committed to protecting our environment for future generations. Recognizing the transboundary aspects of plastic pollution and the importance of curbing it at its source, the United States and France support launching negotiations at the upcoming 5th UN Environment Assembly (UNEA) on a global agreement to address the full lifecycle of plastics and promote a circular economy.  The agreement should include binding and non-binding commitments, call on countries to develop and implement ambitious national action plans, and foster robust engagement of stakeholders to contribute toward the agreement’s objectives while complementing national government contributions.  We look forward to partnering with other countries to achieve a successful outcome at UNEA and in the development of such a global agreement. </p>
