<p>President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. spoke today with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine to reaffirm the commitment of the United States to Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. President Biden strongly condemned Russian President Putin’s decision to purportedly recognize the “independence” of the so-called DNR and LNR regions of Ukraine. He updated President Zelenskyy on the United States’ response, including our plan to issue sanctions. President Biden reiterated that the United States would respond swiftly and decisively, in lock-step with its Allies and partners, to further Russian aggression against Ukraine. </p>

<p>We have anticipated a move like this from Russia and are ready to respond immediately. President Biden will soon issue an Executive Order that will prohibit new investment, trade, and financing by U.S. persons to, from, or in the so-called DNR and LNR regions of Ukraine. This E.O. will also provide authority to impose sanctions on any person determined to operate in those areas of Ukraine. The Departments of State and Treasury will have additional details shortly. We will also soon announce additional measures related to today’s blatant violation of Russia’s international commitments.</p>



<p>To be clear: these measures are separate from and would be in addition to the swift and severe economic measures we have been preparing in coordination with Allies and partners should Russia further invade Ukraine.</p>



<p>We are continuing to closely consult with Allies and partners, including Ukraine, on next steps and on Russia’s ongoing escalation along the border with Ukraine.</p>

<p>As the President has repeatedly made clear, we are committed to pursuing diplomacy until the moment an invasion begins. Secretary Blinken and Foreign Minister Lavrov are scheduled to meet later this week in Europe, provided Russia does not proceed with military action. President Biden accepted in principle a meeting with President Putin following that engagement, again, if an invasion hasn’t happened.  We are always ready for diplomacy.  We are also ready to impose swift and severe consequences should Russia instead choose war.  And currently, Russia appears to be continuing preparations for a full-scale assault on Ukraine very soon. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>The Westin Grand Munich<br>Munich, Germany</em></p>



<p>11:18 A.M. CEST</p>



<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Well, this was an important trip to be here at the Munich Security Conference &#8212; in particular this year, as I said yesterday.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We are looking at a moment that is a very decisive moment on one of the bases for the Munich Security Conference and certainly one of the founding reasons for NATO, which is European security and the connection and alliance between Europe and the United States.</p>



<p>This was a productive trip, in terms of the extensive bilateral meetings that we had that were in furtherance of the ongoing collaboration and partnership with our Allies. &nbsp;</p>



<p>It was important in that, as you all know, this is a moment that is very dynamic.&nbsp; If not every hour, certainly every day, there seem to be new moments of interest and also of intelligence.&nbsp;<br><br>And so we have affirmed, however &#8212; all of that being said &#8212; through these last couple of days, that this Alliance is strong &#8212; probably stronger than it was before; and &#8212; and that this Alliance has purpose and meaning founded on shared principles that are very much at play right now.&nbsp; And as I mentioned yesterday, if we think about those principles, one of the most important is about a mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, which at its essence is what is at play in terms of Russia&#8217;s posture as it relates to Ukraine.<br><br>At stake is the NATO Alliance, in terms of our unity, joining together &#8212; through, sometimes, compromise; certainly always through collaboration &#8212; to be a unified voice, especially when these very founding principles of our relationship are being compromised, if not attacked.</p>



<p>So, with that, I’ll take any questions you have.</p>



<p>AIDE:&nbsp; And I’ll call on folks.&nbsp; So, Nandita from Reuters.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Madam Vice President.&nbsp; During your meeting with President Zelenskyy, he spoke a little bit about asking the U.S. for specific defense aid.&nbsp; Could you talk a little bit about what he asked the United States for and what the U.S. has agreed to offer?</p>



<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; Well, I&#8217;ll tell you what I think you already know: So far, we have offered &#8212; not even offered, we have &#8212; we have transferred and given $650 million in aid.&nbsp; We have also made certain loan guarantees around, in particular, $1 billion.<br><br>And that is on top of all of the work that we have done collectively through the NATO Alliance to provide support for Ukraine.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there anything new that you are planning to offer Ukraine?</p>



<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Well, what I made clear in our meeting and &#8212; is that &#8212; again, this is a dynamic situation.&nbsp; And depending on what happens in the coming days, we will reevaluate the need that Ukraine has and our ability to support.&nbsp; And we have been doing that through the course of these many months.</p>



<p>AIDE:&nbsp; Let&#8217;s go to Molly from ABC.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Madam Vice President.&nbsp; I wanted to ask you, first, are you going to take part in that NSC meeting &#8212;</p>



<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Yes.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; today?</p>



<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Yes.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You are going to take part in that?</p>



<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Yes.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then I wanted to follow up on your meeting with President Zelenskyy yesterday.&nbsp;</p>



<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Okay.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he spoke after your meeting, he shared his frustration with countries like the U.S. who say that a attack is likely to happen in Ukraine but that you won&#8217;t put sanctions in place until that happens.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You &#8212; the administration has continually said that retaining those sanctions holds on to some leverage.&nbsp; But if you believe Putin has made up his mind, what leverage do you really have?&nbsp; Why not put those sanctions in place now?<br><br>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; The purpose of the sanctions has always been and continues to be deterrence.&nbsp; But let&#8217;s also recognize the unique nature of the sanctions that we have outlined.</p>



<p>These are some of the greatest sanctions, if not the strongest, that we&#8217;ve ever issued.&nbsp; As I articulated yesterday, it is directed at institutions &#8212; in particular, financial institutions &#8212; and individuals, and it will exact absolute harm for the Russian economy and their government.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But if Putin has made up his mind, do you feel that this threat that has been looming is really going to deter him?<br><br>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Absolut- &#8212; we strongly believe &#8212; and remember also that the sanctions are a product not only of our perspective as the United States but a shared perspective among our Allies.&nbsp; And the Allied relationship is such that we have agreed that the deterrence effect of these sanctions is still a meaningful one, especially because &#8212; remember, also &#8212; we still sincerely hope that there is a diplomatic path out of this moment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And within the context then of the fact that that window is still opening, altho- &#8212; open, although it is absolutely narrowing &#8212; but within the context of a diplomatic path still being open, the deterrence effect, we believe, has merit.</p>



<p>AIDE:&nbsp; Let&#8217;s go to Jennifer Jacobs from Bloomberg.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Would you be willing to talk a little bit about how the U.S. would get out of this potential conflict with Russia?&nbsp; What is the endgame?&nbsp; How does the U.S. &#8212; after imposing some of these sanctions and possible military action, how does the U.S. disentangle from this?<br><br>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; I would characterize it differently.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t &#8212; we don&#8217;t consider ourselves to be entangled.&nbsp; But we&#8217;re very clear of our principles and our purpose, which is to be aligned with our Allies, understanding that &#8212; I mean, listen, guys, we&#8217;re talking about the potential for war in Europe.<br><br>I mean, let&#8217;s really take a moment to understand the significance of what we&#8217;re talking about.&nbsp; It’s been over 70 years.&nbsp; And through those 70 years, as I mentioned yesterday, there has been peace and security.&nbsp; We are talking about the real possibility of war in Europe.<br><br>So our position is, for us, very clear, which is as a leader &#8212; which we have been, bringing together the Allies, working together around our collective and unified position &#8212; that we would all not just prefer, we desire, we believe it is in the best interest of all that there is a diplomatic end to this moment.&nbsp; And so where do we want this to end?&nbsp; That is where we want it to end.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What should Americans be braced for?&nbsp; What could they possibly be facing?&nbsp; The President has already said Americans will be facing some economic fallout or some hardships.&nbsp; Can you explain to Americans what exactly will they face if this happened?</p>



<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; As the President talked about in his speech, we are aware that, again, when America stands for her principles and all of the things that we hold dear, it requires sometimes for us to put ourselves out there in a way that maybe we will incur some cost.&nbsp; And in this situation, that may relate to energy costs, for example.&nbsp; But we are taking very specific and appropriate, I believe, steps to mitigate what that cost might be if it happens.</p>



<p>AIDE:&nbsp; Let’s go to Eli at the Los Angeles Times.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Madam Vice President.&nbsp; A question about something else that President Zelenskyy said yesterday relating to NATO.&nbsp; He seemed to question the sincerity of Allies, including the U.S., I think, in terms of a desire to admit Ukraine to NATO.&nbsp; Is there any &#8212; is there any reaction to those pretty pointed comments from the President?&nbsp; And was that something that was discussed with Chancellor Scholz and other leaders?<br><br>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Let me start by saying I appreciate and admire President Zelenskyy’s desire to join NATO.&nbsp; And one of, again, the founding principles of NATO is that each country must have the ability &#8212; unimpaired, unimpeded &#8212; to determine their own future, both in terms of their form of government and, in this case, whether they desire to be a member of NATO.<br><br>And I&#8217;ll put that in context, because the obvious is also the point, which is that: and therefore no other country can tell anyone whether they should or should not join NATO.&nbsp; That should be their independent choice.&nbsp; That is the point of sovereignty.&nbsp; So I respect President Zelenskyy’s desire to be a member of NATO.&nbsp;</p>



<p>NATO is a membership.&nbsp; It is about nations coming together as a group, making decisions collectively around, again, principles and what will be, then, the conditions and &#8212; and the standards of membership.&nbsp; And so that is the process.</p>



<p>It doesn&#8217;t happen overnight.  No one country can say “I want to be, and therefore I will be.”  And no one country can say &#8220;You can&#8217;t be.&#8221;  And isn&#8217;t that at the heart of the very issue we’re presented with in terms of Russia&#8217;s aggression, or stated aggression, toward Ukraine?</p>



<p>Q    Was it surprising to you, though, that he planted that flag so firmly on that issue &#8212; given that that&#8217;s obviously Putin&#8217;s main demand, is that he gets some sort of guarantee, swearing that Ukraine won&#8217;t be admitted &#8212; that Zelenskyy wants to make it clear that they do want to enter the organization?  Was that a surprise that he would come and say that at this point in this crisis?  And does that make it less likely that there&#8217;ll be some sort of diplomatic resolution?<br><br>THE VICE PRESIDENT:  I&#8217;m not going to second guess President Zelenskyy’s desires for his own country.  But I will say this: Let us recognize the position he is in right now.  His country is virtually surrounded by Russian troops.  I believe he came here &#8212; this is my belief, based on just my own assessment and speculation &#8212; he came here to make a very clear point that he does not stand alone.<br></p>



<p>In fact, I told him in our meeting, “The United States stands with you.”  Because we do, as do this community of Allies and partners.</p>



<p>So I understand where he &#8212; why he came here.  And I would not second guess &#8212; I will not second guess why he spoke the words he speaks.<br></p>



<p>He&#8217;s in a position, again, where his country is virtually surrounded by what &#8212; by, I think most reasonable people would believe, hostile troops.<br></p>



<p>AIDE:  Let’s go to Aamer at The AP, please.</p>



<p>Q    Thank you, Madam Vice President.  So Daleep Singh said late last week that SWIFT sanctions probably won&#8217;t be part of the opening gambit if sanctions go forward.  Considering the administration saying early and often that you&#8217;re going to stay high &#8212; start high and stay high, how does that square?  How can you start high and stay high without SWIFT sanctions in the package?<br><br>THE VICE PRESIDENT:  We&#8217;re going to take this one moment at a time in terms of what might need to happen in the future in terms of escalation.  But right now, we&#8217;ve made our position clear.</p>



<p>AIDE:&nbsp; And last question, let&#8217;s go to Natasha at CNN.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Madam Vice President.&nbsp; I&#8217;m wondering whether the U.S. has evidence that Putin has actually given the order to his subordinates to launch an attack and whether that intelligence and that evidence is shared and agreed upon by the Allies here &#8212; and that includes Zelenskyy, who has been skeptical of this kind of intelligence in the past.</p>



<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; As the President has said, we believe that Putin has made his decision.&nbsp; Period.&nbsp; And &#8212; but I will also say that, as part of our relationship and partnership, in &#8212; in the context of the Alliance, we do share information, certainly, because we want to make sure that we are all working with the same information when we make these very critical and meaningful decisions &#8212; the last question about sanctions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I said it yesterday on the stage: Everybody didn&#8217;t agree at the beginning about what the consequences should be if Russia re-invades Ukraine.&nbsp; We had to meet.&nbsp; We had to discuss it.&nbsp; Because each of these nations &#8212; I mean, I spe- &#8212; I spent time &#8212; a considerable amount of time with the Chancellor of Germany yesterday.&nbsp; I &#8212; I spent time with the President of the EU yesterday.&nbsp; When we look at the significance of these sanctions, they are immense.&nbsp;<br><br>And so, all nations who are a part of this understand that we cannot take lightly or speak lightly about what we are prepared to do, because we do understand the cost we are exacting, and it is severe.<br><br>So we have had these discussions, again, through a process.&nbsp; We have arrived at this place.&nbsp; And &#8212; and back to the last question, we will, obviously, reassess depending on how the days, weeks, and months ahead roll out.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And do you believe &#8212;</p>



<p>AIDE:&nbsp; Thank you all.</p>



<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; But &#8212; just go on.&nbsp; You can go to the follow-up (inaudible).</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was just going to ask: Do you believe that the U.S. and Ukraine are now more on the same page about what the intelligence suggests than they have been in the past?</p>



<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; I can tell you that there has been direct communication about the intelligence, so nothing is being held back.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vice President, the Prime Minister of Italy does not agree with all of the sanctions plans.&nbsp; He said yesterday that he does not feel that energy should be sanctioned.&nbsp; Does that not undercut U.S. efforts to impose tough, painful, severe financial sanctions?</p>



<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; As I&#8217;ve said, this is an alliance of nations that each have their priorities and their &#8212; their individual concerns about how anything we do going forward will impact their specific country, their economy, and their security.&nbsp;<br><br>So, again, I would not deny Italy from having its perspective or its list of concerns; we all do, actually.&nbsp; That has been part of this process.&nbsp; And so Italy is very much at the table in terms of these conversations about how we can do this in a way that achieves its intended purpose, which &#8212; back to the earlier point &#8212; is about deterring Russia from invading a sovereign nation.<br><br>And we all understand, including every country in Europe, what war in Europe looks like and what it can mean for the citizens of each of those countries.</p>



<p>Thank you.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Commerzbank Filiale München<br>Munich, Germany</em></p>



<p>2:12 P.M. CEST<br><br>VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:&nbsp; I&#8217;m looking forward to our conversation.&nbsp;As you know, this is a decisive moment in our world&#8217;s history.&nbsp;And this is an important meeting for that and many other reasons.</p>



<p>I look forward, in this discussion, to hearing directly from you about the situation on the ground in Ukraine.&nbsp; I look forward to, in this way, also hearing from you about what your concerns are and also sharing with you information that we may have in a way that we will continue to work together.</p>



<p>This is also a chance for me to reiterate the position of the United States as it relates to Ukraine.&nbsp; As I have said earlier today to our allies around the world, the United States take seriously the importance of the integrity and the territorial integrity of Ukraine and your sovereignty.&nbsp; And the United States stands with Ukraine in this regard.</p>



<p>If Russia further invades your country, as I mentioned earlier today, we will impose swift and severe economic sanctions.&nbsp; We have been clear about that.&nbsp; We are also clear that we would prefer that this would be resolved in a diplomatic way, and we have remained open to a diplomatic path to resolution.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, if Russia takes aggressive action against Ukraine, we are prepared to implement and to do that work in a unified way with our allies around the world.</p>



<p>Any threats to your country, we take seriously, and we have rallied our Allies and our partners to speak with one voice.&nbsp; And those voices have been reflected throughout the course of these last couple of days and before.&nbsp; So I look forward to our conversation.&nbsp; And thank you.<br><br>PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY:&nbsp; (As interpreted.)&nbsp; Thank you very much, Madam Vice President.&nbsp; And thank you for this meeting.&nbsp; This is our first meeting, and I&#8217;m very grateful to you and to our team for having this opportunity to talk to you about the situation which is happening around our borders; about the risks and how to resolve this matter and, I do agree with you, in a peaceful and diplomatic manner, as we have been doing all eight years in a row.</p>



<p>We do clearly understand what is going on.&nbsp; This is our land, and the only thing we want is to have peace, bring the peace back to our country.</p>



<p>And in this case, we are very grateful to the United States, to you personally, to our strategic partners, and President Biden.&nbsp; We have had many meetings with the congressmen and Senate members.&nbsp; And we are grateful for the bipartisan support of the United States.</p>



<p>Today, we do need specific steps, specific support.&nbsp; We are getting support from you in supporting our defense capacity, our army.&nbsp; This is something we are prepared to discuss and continue this dialogue because this is something that we are very interested in.</p>



<p>When I say “we,” I mean not only Ukraine, because our strong army is protecting Europe and we all want to be one unified body, one world which looks into the peaceful future.</p>



<p>As regards to the sanction policy, we are grateful to you for your understanding that sanctions may bring about peaceful resolution of this matter.&nbsp; And I would like to share with you that what &#8212; how we see this, what we think the needs are, and what we think can work.</p>



<p>In any case, we believe in our own strengths and force, the support of our partners, our army.&nbsp; And thank you very much again for this meeting.</p>



<p>VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>END&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2:16 P.M. CEST</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Hotel Bayerischer Hof<br>Munich, Germany</em></p>



<p>11:45 A.M. CEST</p>



<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Good morning.&nbsp; Good morning.&nbsp; Thank you, Ambassador Ischinger.&nbsp; And to all of the very extraordinary leaders who are here today, I thank you for the kind introduction and your years of dedicated leadership.&nbsp; And thank you also to Chancellor Scholz for your kind words.<br><br>So, it is an honor to join all of these distinguished leaders from around the world this morning.</p>



<p>I am certain we all recognize this year’s gathering is unlike those of the recent past.&nbsp; Not since the end of the Cold War has this forum convened under such dire circumstances.<br><br>Today, as we are all well aware, the foundation of European security is under direct threat in Ukraine.&nbsp;<br><br>Let us remember: From the wreckage of two world wars, a consensus emerged in Europe and the United States.&nbsp; A consensus in favor of order, not chaos; security, not conflict.<br><br>So by forging relationships and bonds, forging organizations and institutions, laws and treaties, we, together, established a set of rules, norms that have governed ever since.<br><br>And Europe has enjoyed unprecedented peace, security, and prosperity through a commitment to a set of defining principles.&nbsp; The United States is equally committed to these principles: that people have a right to choose their own form of government; that nations have a right to choose their own alliances; that there are inalienable rights which governments must protect; that the rule of law should be cherished; that sovereignty and territorial integrity of all states must be respected; and that national borders should not be changed by force.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>We are here in Munich, together, to reaffirm our commitment to these principles.&nbsp; These principles have brought us peace and security.&nbsp; The backbone of this, of course, is NATO &#8212; the greatest military alliance the world has ever seen.<br><br>As a defensive alliance, we have deterred acts of aggression against NATO territory for the past 75 years.&nbsp; And today, let me be clear: America’s commitment to Article 5 is ironclad.&nbsp; This commitment is sacrosanct to me, to President Biden, and to our entire nation.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>In fact, I am joined here in Munich by a bipartisan delegation from the United States Senate and the United States House of Representatives.&nbsp; They are Democrats and Republicans.&nbsp; They have a wide range of political views.&nbsp; But they stand together in recognition of the value and the importance of our NATO Alliance.<br><br>Now, even in the most difficult times for our transatlantic community and even when our system has been tried and tested, we, the United States and Europe, have come together and demonstrated our strength and our unity, just as we do today &#8212; as we stand in this decisive moment, with all eyes on Ukraine.<br><br>As we have said all along, there is a playbook of Russian aggression.&nbsp; And this playbook is too familiar to us all.</p>



<p>Russia will plead ignorance and innocence, it will create false pretext for invasion, and it will amass troops and firepower in plain sight.<br><br>We now receive reports of what appears to be provocations.&nbsp; And we see Russia spreading disinformation, lies, and propaganda.<br><br>Nonetheless, in a deliberate and coordinated effort, we, together, are: one, exposing the truth and, two, speaking with a unified voice.<br><br>As President Joe Biden has made clear: The United States, our NATO Allies, and our partners have been and remain open to serious diplomacy.&nbsp; We have put concrete proposals on the table.&nbsp; We have encouraged and engaged Russia through NATO, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the United Nations, and bilateral dialogues.&nbsp; We have engaged in good faith.</p>



<p>Russia continues to claim it is ready for talks while, at the same time, it narrows the avenues for diplomacy.&nbsp; Their actions simply do not match their words.<br><br>And let me be clear.&nbsp; I can say with absolute certainty: If Russia further invades Ukraine, the United States, together with our Allies and partners, will impose significant and unprecedented economic costs.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>We have worked intensively with many of you in this room to ensure we are prepared to move forward with consequences.<br><br>We have prepared, together, economic measures that will be swift, severe, and united.&nbsp; We will impose far-reaching financial sanctions and export controls.&nbsp; We will target Russia’s financial institutions and key industries.&nbsp; And we will target those who are complicit and those who aid and abet this unprovoked invasion.<br><br>Make no mistake: The imposition of these sweeping and coordinated measures will inflict great damage on those who must be held accountable.&nbsp; And we will not stop with economic measures.&nbsp; We will further reinforce our NATO Allies on the eastern flank.<br><br>In fact, together we have already taken steps to strengthen our deterrence and collective defense.&nbsp; We have deployed an additional 6,000 American service members to Romania, Poland, and Germany.&nbsp; We have put another 8,500 service members in the United States on a heightened sense of readiness.<br><br>As President Biden has said, our forces will not be deployed to fight inside Ukraine, but they will defend every inch of NATO territory.<br><br>Since Russia launched its proxy war against Ukraine nearly eight years ago, the people of Ukraine have suffered immensely: nearly 14,000 people killed, more than a million displaced, and nearly 3 million in need of aid.<br><br>The United States has provided significant support to Ukraine: security assistance, humanitarian assistance, and economic assistance.&nbsp; And we will continue to support the people of Ukraine.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br>I believe it is important for us &#8212; all of us &#8212; as leaders to never forget the cost of this type of aggression on human lives and livelihoods.<br><br>So, the United States, our Allies, and our partners, together, we have achieved remarkable unity.&nbsp; It is evident in our shared acknowledgment of the threats, our united response, and our determination to uphold international rules and norms.<br><br>In the face of Russian aggression, I have been reassured and heartened by the widespread agreement across the transatlantic community that these rules and norms will be defended.<br><br>And we should not lose sight of how rare it is in history to have a prolonged period of relative peace and stability.&nbsp; So, let the past few months be a reminder to us all: Defending the rules and norms, upholding our principles &#8212; this is the vital work of each generation.<br><br>In recent years, some have questioned whether the West is up to the task.&nbsp; Some have wondered whether this system can endure.&nbsp; Some have even done so on this very stage.<br><br>Indeed, the theme of this conference two years ago questioned the staying power of the West; whether or not the transatlantic community was losing its cohesion, its influence, its appeal.<br><br>So I will answer the skeptics and those seeking to test us: Today, the United States, our Allies, and our partners are closer together.&nbsp; Today, we are clear in our purpose.&nbsp; And today, we are even more confident in our vision.<br><br>Our strength must not be underestimated, because, after all, it lies in our unity.&nbsp; And as we have always shown, it takes a lot more strength to build something up than it takes to tear something down.<br><br>Thank you all.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>AMBASSADOR ISCHINGER:&nbsp; Madam Vice President, thank you so much for this great speech, which I think will be commented about and read about quite a bit in coming hours and days and weeks.</p>



<p>Before we start our conversation, let me repeat what I said before you came into the hall.&nbsp; It was in 2009, President Biden who established &#8212; having just been elected Vice President at that time &#8212; a young tradition, namely that the United States would be represented in Munich by the Vice President.</p>



<p>And he came several times.&nbsp; And I was delighted to see that even the Trump administration followed that example.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re now so happy to have you to continue this tradition.&nbsp; And I would be delighted if you can convey to the President that even if he is now no longer the Vice President, he has always a standing invitation here.&nbsp; (Laughter.)<br><br>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Yes, Ambassador, I will.&nbsp; And I will tell you, it is the President&#8217;s enthusiasm about the importance of this conference that led to my enthusiasm to be with you this afternoon.&nbsp; So thank you very much.<br><br>AMBASSADOR ISCHINGER:&nbsp; Now, on a slightly more serious note: A year ago, when the President appeared on our screen &#8212; actually, in this room &#8212; I was standing right here in this room when he appeared on screen and he said, and I quote, “America is back.&nbsp; The transatlantic alliance is back.”</p>



<p>Now, that was a message that was extremely well received here, even if we &#8212; not all of us knew that we would be threatened in the way that we feel threatened right now, as you just explained.</p>



<p>But as we look forward, there are lots of people here in Germany, in Europe, who asking themselves, “Okay, America is back.&nbsp; That&#8217;s great.&nbsp; But is it for good?&nbsp; Is this for good?”&nbsp; Many in Europe are fearful of a time where maybe some kind of a second Trump could be looming in the future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So here&#8217;s my question: What can or should we Europeans do to keep the United States engaged in Europe long term, not just today as we sit here, and even beyond the current administration?<br><br>I think that is such an important question, because we have learned over these last weeks and months that without the United States considering herself a European power, we&#8217;re actually quite powerless.<br><br>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; I think the evidence of the point that I will make is present in this room.&nbsp; You will see there is probably one of the largest delegations from the United States Congress present today &#8212; Republicans and Democrats who, as I said earlier, you know, often don&#8217;t agree on much, but agree on this.</p>



<p>I would &#8212; I think that the heart of your question really does demand the importance of &#8212; of the perseverance and enduring nature of institutions and alliances.&nbsp; And I would say that, on that point, we are strong.</p>



<p>There is an unwavering commitment to NATO and to the Alliance, as evidenced, again, by the conversations and the unity that has resulted over the last several months where nations have come together, where the United States, we would like to believe, has been among leaders in playing a leadership role to bring together the Allies around common principles and norms, doing it in a way that has been, at its essence, about the value and the strength of diplomacy, which is about direct engagement.</p>



<p>We have counted &#8212; and the Secretary of State is here, Tony Blinken.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve counted an excess of at least 200 conversations just in the last couple of months, be it between the President and others, the Secretary of State, myself, and so on.</p>



<p>So I would say to you that the relationship is strong and that the importance of the relationship is something that we take very seriously, which is why in this historic moment, in this defining moment, potentially, the strength of the institution and the Alliance reveals itself, even if there&#8217;s been a question about that before.<br><br>AMBASSADOR ISCHINGER:  Thank you so much. <br><br>Now, another key team &#8212; key theme of our special edition with President Biden a year ago was this question, and I&#8217;d be interested in your response today.  The question was: Can democracies prove that they can still deliver better solutions to the world&#8217;s major challenges than autocracies?<br></p>



<p>There are skeptics who would probably not have a hard time finding evidence to the contrary over the past period.  What do we need, what do democracies need in order to do better and to convince our people &#8212; peoples that we can do it?<br><br>THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Ambassador, I think this is one of the most challenging issues of our time, which is the relative strength &#8212; the question about the relative strength, efficiency, and effectiveness of democracies versus autocracies.<br><br>I&#8217;m going to always bet on democracies.  I think all of us here share that in common.  And it is a reflection of, again, the principles that we have that include the importance of being a government that reflects the needs and desires of the people through a process that has integrity, that rejects corruption, and embraces the concepts of equality and freedom.<br><br>When we look at the challenge that we face now, in the United States &#8212; and you&#8217;re right, President Joe Biden talks a lot about this &#8212; and we take pride in the fact that the strength of a democra- &#8212; democracy, one measure of that strength will be: Does it deliver on the needs of the people?<br><br>So, for example, in the United States &#8212; again, with thanks and with great attribution to the congressional delegates that are here &#8212; we passed a Bipartisan Infrastructure Law that was one of the first in generations that will deliver on the needs of the people. <br><br>So, I would say that the strength of democracies and the way that democracies will prevail, one &#8212; one measure of that will be: Does it actually deliver for the people? <br><br>But that being said, there is a duality that is always present, I believe, which is that democracy is both &#8212; it both has the characters of &#8212; characteristics of strength and fragility, meaning that it is incumbent on each of us to understand the strength of democracy to deliver for the people, but also the fragility of democracies, which is that if we are not vigilant, if we don&#8217;t fight for the principles, then they can fade. <br><br>And so, that, again, brings us to the reason that we are here today: to continuously reaffirm and rededicate ourselves as a community to the strength of democracies and the need for us to not only individually but collectively uphold its principles, its values, and its purpose.<br><br>AMBASSADOR ISCHINGER:  Thank you very much.  Now, I think I have no choice but to return to our overriding theme this weekend, which has been when Secretary Stoltenberg spoke earlier and Chancellor Scholz spoke just before you.  Of course, the central theme was &#8212; and you talked about it just a few minutes ago &#8212; was Ukraine. <br><br>So, the Biden administration, the President himself, you &#8212; you&#8217;ve all stated that you expect that there will be some kind of military action by Russia going forward.  Now, I &#8212; personally, I&#8217;ve no question about your determination to do what you announced to do. <br></p>



<p>But I think this audience would be interested in how you and the Biden administration judges our readiness.  Do you think we, Europeans, are sufficiently prepared for such a kind of worst-case scenario, which would &#8212; in my view at least, which would tend to sort of, you know, terminate the search for a durable and peaceful European security architecture?  And we&#8217;ve been working on that for more than a generation &#8212; for two generations.<br><br>So, the question is: If you could reflect a bit about how you think about this and what, conceivably, Americans and Europeans &#8212; working together &#8212; what we could do in the future even better in terms of speaking with Russia, not only about Russia. <br><br>You know, one of the things I really regret is that the Russian government decided not to come here.  I would have appreciated an opportunity to challenge them on this stage, as has been the case for many years here Munich. <br><br>So &#8212; but I think you understand my question.<br><br>THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, as I said in my speech, I am reassured and heartened by the work that we have collectively done over the last several months.  And it is work.  Not everyone started out in the same place in terms of a variety of issues that are on the table.  How do we define &#8220;aggression&#8221;?  What should be the consequences?  Which consequences are appropriate?  Which are we willing to pursue?  Which aren&#8217;t we willing to pursue?  So we didn&#8217;t all start out in the same place. <br><br>But through diplomacy &#8212; and again, this speaks to the strength of diplomacy &#8212; we came together and are now speaking with a unified voice.  And that voice was a function of not only dialogue, but debate, some concessions, but also a practical realization of the moment that we&#8217;re in, which is that we are looking at a sovereign nation that may very well be on the verge of being invaded yet again.<br><br>And perhaps this is a moment, as life does present us with those moments, that challenge us to ask what is our reason for being.  And I think we all know the history of NATO and its reason for being.  The spirit behind this term we use, &#8220;the transatlantic community.&#8221;  The word &#8220;community,&#8221; meaning a collection, not &#8212; a collection of individuals who see themselves as a collection than as one.  And that’s where we are now.<br><br>I don’t disagree with you that it would be nice if we were presented with other circumstances, be it at this conference or in the world, but that’s not where we are.<br><br>We remain open to diplomacy.  We have said it continuously, and our deeds, our words, and our actions have reflected that priority.</p>



<p>We believe that when you define the strength of any nation &#8212; certainly I&#8217;ll speak for the United States &#8212; we believe it is an expression of our strength to seek, as a first priority, a diplomatic resolution to any conflict.&nbsp; And I believe we&#8217;ve been clear about that.&nbsp; But yet, we are presented with this moment today.</p>



<p>And so the question is: If that diplomacy leads to a dead end &#8212; we hope it does not; I said that again in my speech today, the President said it last night &#8212; we are still open to a diplomatic resolution.&nbsp; But if it does not, we are also clear-eyed that there must be consequences.&nbsp;<br><br>And so we have clearly articulated the consequences we have in store, and they will be severe and swift.&nbsp; And they were derived through a process, again, of diplomatic discussions and engagement wherein there has been some consensus around what would be appropriate, given perhaps some predictable scenarios.</p>



<p>I think this moment speaks to, yes, a moment we would like to avoid, if it was avoidable, but it also speaks to our resolve to speak with one voice and a unified voice.</p>



<p>History has challenged us over the years in that regard.&nbsp; But I think history will show that, at this moment, we are standing strong.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>AMBASSADOR ISCHINGER:&nbsp; Madam Vice President, I can only thank you on behalf of our participants of this audience and of those who are listening from the outside for traveling over &#8212; for coming over here in these difficult circumstances with pandemic conditions.&nbsp; You know, under more normal circumstances, there would be like 600 people in this hall.&nbsp; It would be totally overcrowded.&nbsp; So thank you for doing this.&nbsp;<br>Thank you for doing this for us.&nbsp; For us here in Europe, it’s &#8212; it’s an enormously reassuring message.&nbsp;<br><br>And I want to invite all of you to offer to the Vice President of the United States a warm round of applause, if you could, please.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>END&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 12:14 P.M. CEST</p>
