<p class="has-text-align-center">Via Teleconference</p>



<p>9:12 A.M. KST</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Good morning, everybody.&nbsp; I hope you all had a restful night in Seoul.&nbsp; Apologies for the delay.</p>



<p>Thanks so much for joining us today on this background call.&nbsp; As mentioned on the invite, this call will be on background, attributable to &#8220;senior administration officials,&#8221; and embargoed until the call&#8217;s conclusion.</p>



<p>Not for reporting for just for everyone&#8217;s knowledge, joining us on this call is [senior administration official].&nbsp;</p>



<p>[Senior administration official] has some remarks to make off the top, and then we will take some questions before our speaker has to run into another commitment.</p>



<p>So, with that, I will turn it over to [senior administration official].</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Good morning, everyone.&nbsp; And thanks for joining both the trip and then joining us this morning.&nbsp; I’ll try and keep this as short as possible and take some questions.</p>



<p>So, as I&#8217;m sure all of you know, today the President has a packed day.&nbsp; But before I get into it, I do want to very quickly highlight yesterday’s tour of the Samsung Pyeongtaek facility by the President, President Yoon, and Secretary Raimondo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think as you all are aware, this is essentially the model of the facility that Samsung has &#8212; is starting to build in Taylor, Texas, that will create 3,000 new good-paying jobs.&nbsp; And it’s also an example of the strong partnership between the United States and the ROK, as well as the value of the relationship in terms of generating investment in the United States.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s an example of how the Biden administration is deepening our economic ties with the region to deliver for U.S. workers, businesses, consumers, and of course for people everywhere, including in the ROK.</p>



<p>You’ll see us continue to deepen our economic ties on this trip, including with the launch of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework.&nbsp; We firmly believe that much of what happens in the coming decades will depend on how well governments harness innovation &#8212; and especially the transformations afoot in clean energy and digital and tech sectors &#8212; while fortifying our economies from a range of vulnerabilities that we&#8217;ve seen, in particular, driven home by the impacts of the pandemic.&nbsp; And this ranges from fragile supply chains, to the vulnerabilities to disruption, to corruption, to tax havens.</p>



<p>And from our view, this requires a new model that we can move on quickly, and that&#8217;s what IPEF will do.&nbsp; We are pleased to see the very strong interests in the region for IPEF and for our economic engagement in the region, which we think reflects the continuing importance of an affirmative U.S. vision for the region, which we highlight in our Indo-Pacific strategy, as well as the desire in the region for continued U.S. economic leadership.</p>



<p>So, very quickly, to walk over today’s schedule.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We&#8217;ll start on &#8212; the first event will be: The President will participate in a wreath-laying ceremony to pay his respects to those who died to defend the Republic of Korea, many of whom died &#8212; many of those who died fought alongside U.S. forces in the Korean War.&nbsp; And I think this reflects the deep commitment to our joint security and to our alliance, and the President&#8217;s deep respect for those who paid the ultimate price to defend our freedoms.</p>



<p>I think that this also reflects what we see as one of the major things from the visit &#8212; or outcomes from the visit, which is continued collaboration in strengthening our alliance to deal with today&#8217;s challenges.</p>



<p>The President will then participate in a bilateral meeting with President Yoon Suk Yeol.  They will have extensive discussions on a range of issues, as I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;d expect.  We expect that there will be a joint statement. </p>



<p>And we expect that, you know, really, what we&#8217;re doing in this, as much as anything else, is building on the strong alliance &#8212; to expand it; to take it to deal with global issues and the issues and challenges of today; and, I think, also to take advantage of the visit, which comes so early in President Yoon&#8217;s time in office &#8212; I mean, this is unprecedented, as you all know &#8212; to really build a strong personal relationship between the two leaders that we think will help propel the relationship going forward.</p>



<p>And as you all know, the relationship between the U.S. and the ROK is something that is extraordinarily important to both countries but, we believe, is increasingly important for the region and to promote peace and stability and prosperity throughout the Indo-Pacific, as well as around the world.</p>



<p>So, you know, I think some of the key things that we expect the presidents to discuss will be the ROK&#8217;s role and the U.S.-ROK alliance&#8217;s role as a lynchpin for peace and security.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think that we expect that there will be some discussions on how to deal with some of the most recent threats and developments that have occurred.</p>



<p>We also believe that there will be discussion on how we can find ways to further expand our cooperation to make sure that we&#8217;re ready and &#8212; as ready as possible to deal with the threats of today.</p>



<p>I think that, you know, as you would expect, the presidents will discuss DPRK and, you know, reaffirm the continuing commitment to the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.</p>



<p>We believe that there will be discussion on how we can manage and address the most recent threats, particularly posed by the nuclear program, as well as the ongoing missile program.&nbsp; And very confident the leaders will stress the importance and agree on the importance of all countries fully enforcing U.N. Security Council resolutions.&nbsp; And also, we&#8217;re going to call on the DPRK to abide by its obligations under the U.N. Security Council resolutions.</p>



<p>I think the will discuss ways forward in &#8212; on a variety of issues associated with DPRK.&nbsp; And, you know, I don&#8217;t want to prejudge and get ahead of the discussions, but we&#8217;re very confident it will be very thorough, it will be very wide-ranging, and very detailed.<br><br>The presidents will also recognize the future of the alliance.&nbsp; It’s not just going to be defined by security, as has been the case in the past, but it’s also going to be defined by creating a strategic economic and technology partnership that really will reflect the importance of innovation and technology to both countries and to our work in the region going forward.</p>



<p>I think that the &#8212; we expect that there will be some work on how we can better support innovation, how we can support partnership on critical emerging technologies, and, you know, find ways to strengthen cooperation on defense industry issues.&nbsp;<br><br>I think that there will be work on &#8212; there&#8217;ll be discussion of secure supply chains and their importance.&nbsp; And I think that we’re very confident that we will have a discussion about the impact on global economic iss- &#8212; on the global economy of Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine.&nbsp; And that we know that there is great interest in both countries on how we can better make ourselves more resilient in the face of disruptions in global energy as well as other economic issues linked to Russia&#8217;s invasion.<br><br>I think that you can expect some discussion of both nuclear cooperation as well as other technology-related issues.&nbsp; And I think that you can also expect that there will be discussion of the importance of our own economic relationship bilaterally and how we can work together to bring prosperity to the region through the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework.<br><br>I think that we also recognize that, you know, as I said before, part of this visit is about turning a bilateral alliance into something that was traditionally very much focused on peace and stability in the Korean Peninsula, and then immediately in Northeast Asia, to something that really looks to the region &#8212; to the Indo-Pacific region &#8212; and to the world.<br><br>I think that there&#8217;s &#8212; there&#8217;ll be discussion about the threats posed by climate change, by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the importance of promoting democracy and shared values.<br><br>I think that we recognize that we also need to better work together to deal not just with the current pandemic but prepare for future ones.&nbsp; And so, I think that we&#8217;ll be looking for ways in which we can better cooperate, and I think the presidents will discuss that.<br><br>I think that we will have some discussion on other technology issues, including the importance of a free, open, secure Internet.&nbsp; I think that there&#8217;ll be some discussion about cyber.&nbsp; And I think that we will stress the importance of all countries standing together against efforts to destabilize the &#8212; or threaten the rules-based international order and, first and foremost, Ukraine.&nbsp; And we expect some pretty extensive discussions on Ukraine.&nbsp;<br><br>And I think the U.S. and the President will highlight the great U.S. appreciation for the Republic of Korea’s strong stance on Ukraine, both in terms of imposition of sanctions and taking of economic steps, and we&#8217;ll look for ways to expand that.</p>



<p>I think the ROK has been particularly strong on this, because I think they recognize that, because of their own history and our shared history together, the importance of a strong international reaction to invasions of this kind.</p>



<p>I think the presidents are going to discuss the importance of promoting a free and open Indo-Pacific, look for areas in which we can expand cooperation with both Southeast Asia as well as on the Pacific Islands, and look for ways in which we can better integrate our efforts across the entire range of Indo-Pacific issues.</p>



<p>I think that there will be some discussions about other issues involving regional security.&nbsp; And I don&#8217;t want to prejudge those, but I think that you will see that there &#8212;&nbsp;there is a great commonality in terms of our vision of the importance of a strong response to threats to the international order, particularly in the Indo-Pacific.<br><br>And I think that we strongly believe that this visit will highlight both what &#8212; how strong our alliance is today.&nbsp; But really, this is about building for the future, building a much stronger bilateral alliance and one that deals with strategic and issues globally, but also building a strong personal relationship with the leaders that will propel this going forward.<br><br>So, with that, I&#8217;ll take a few questions.</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Thanks so much, [senior administration official].&nbsp; If you have a question, please use the “raise hand” function of the Zoom interface.&nbsp; And we&#8217;ll try to get through as many questions as we can.<br><br>Why don&#8217;t we start with Aamer Madhani from the Associated Press?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hello.&nbsp; I&#8217;m sorry, I was having trouble with the mute button there.&nbsp; But so &#8212; hopefully, you can hear me.</p>



<p>Is there going to be an explicit message to Kim Jong Un today in what the President says in his public comments?&nbsp; And I was also wondering what, if any, assurances Jake Sullivan got from Yang Jiechi about addressing the North Korean issue in their talk?</p>



<p>And finally, do you &#8212; [senior administration official], do you believe there is any connection between the rise in COVID rates inside North Korea and Kim&#8217;s seemingly increased saber-rattling?&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Thanks very much.&nbsp; And I&#8217;m very sympathetic to problems with muting and unmuting.<br><br>So let me address a couple of things.&nbsp; I think, first of all, you know, I don&#8217;t want to get ahead of the discussions between the leaders.&nbsp; But I think you can expect that there will be extensive discussion about DPRK issues.<br><br>I think that we are very concerned about the COVID situation in the DPRK.&nbsp; We&#8217;re very sensitive to the fact that they’re &#8212; they appear to be facing a quite serious situation.&nbsp; And I think you&#8217;ve seen we are &#8212; we stand ready to work with others in the international community as needed to provide assistance.&nbsp; And that includes, obviously, the ROK, but it includes others and using the existing international mechanisms, but this is something that is of deep concern to us.</p>



<p>I think that in terms of, you know, your characterization of the increased saber-rattling, what we&#8217;ve seen is a fair amount of saber-rattling throughout the year.&nbsp; There have obviously been quite a few tests of ballistic missiles, some of which have been successful.</p>



<p>And I think that, you know, from our standpoint, we are ready.&nbsp; We &#8212; you know, we, at the same time, it is very much our desire that we find ways to have a diplomatic approach with the DPRK.&nbsp; We have made very clear we&#8217;re prepared to talk to them and with no preconditions, and we&#8217;re also prepared to take steps to address their domestic challenges, including COVID.</p>



<p>I think that in terms of the discussion with Yang Jiechi, as you&#8217;d expect, there was discussion about the challenges of the DPRK, including their domestic situation, the COVID issue.</p>



<p>I think that, you know, we&#8217;re looking for ways in which we and others in the international community can work together to provide assistance as needed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I think that the key thing is that we recognize that the DPRK has to make decisions about what they&#8217;re willing to do.&nbsp; It is our hope that they will make decisions that will allow for the maximum amount of support in this time of great need and great crisis.</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Thanks so much, [senior administration official].&nbsp; Next, let&#8217;s go to Trevor Hunnicutt with Reuters.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey, thanks so much for doing this.&nbsp; So, just wanted to follow up on what Aamer asked about a little bit there &#8212; was just if there was any level of commitment from China to help on the North Korea situation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And also, do you expect this joint statement to deal with what you&#8217;ve described as China&#8217;s destabilizing policies towards Taiwan, its human rights issues?</p>



<p>And also, if you could talk a little bit about what the President is doing this morning.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thank you.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Yeah. &nbsp;So, you know, I think, first, with regard to the joint statement, I don&#8217;t want to prejudge the discussions, but I think that, you know, we expect extensive discussions about regional security issues.&nbsp; And the fact that, in our view, both leaders of both countries strongly support preserving peace and stability in the region.</p>



<p>I think that with re- &#8212; I don’t want to get into the specifics of the discussions between Jake Sullivan and Yang Jiechi, but just to say that, of course, we are looking for ways in which it is possible to provide assistance and support to the DPRK as they deal with this COVID outbreak.</p>



<p>I think that, in terms of the broader issues that you raised, I think that we want to find ways to work with the international community to provide support to the DPRK.&nbsp; I think we also want to make clear that the international community stands united in opposition to their violations of U.N. Security Council resolutions and their destabilizing and threatening behavior.</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Thanks so much.&nbsp; Next, why don&#8217;t we go to Esther Oh with NHK.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, thank you so much for doing this.&nbsp; Just two questions.&nbsp; I know previously the administration says it has no plans to share vaccines with North Korea directly, but is the President planning to discuss with President Yoon ways that the U.S. and South Korea can work together to provide any sort of direct COVID aid to North Korea?</p>



<p>And my second question is: Will the President directly address the immediate need for South Korea and Japan to improve their bilateral ties?&nbsp; Because the relationship between the two countries &#8212; it&#8217;s deteriorated significantly in the last several years.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Thank you very much.&nbsp; Those are both, obviously, very good and very important questions.&nbsp; I think that you could expect that the leaders will discuss the COVID situation.&nbsp; I think that it&#8217;s &#8212; it&#8217;s very clear that we have a common interest in doing whatever we can to address this challenge and working through the international &#8212; with the international communities through whatever mechanism is appropriate.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t want to get ahead of those discussions, but I think that you can expect that this is something that&#8217;s very topical and we recognize that this is of great importance to the DPRK&#8217;s neighbors, as well as to us.</p>



<p>I think that with regard to the ROK-Japan relations, I think, you know, we strongly support improved ROK-Japan relations.&nbsp; At the same time, we recognize this is something that both countries are &#8212; it&#8217;s sensitive and important for both countries.&nbsp; And I think the President will make clear his support while also making clear his understanding of the need for this to be done in a way that&#8217;s mutually acceptable and agreeable to both countries.</p>



<p>However, it&#8217;s very clear that from the U.S. perspective &#8212; and we&#8217;ve been clear about this in the past &#8212; it is not in our interest for the relationship between the two of our closest and most political allies to not be strong.&nbsp; And so we want &#8212; we very much hope and support efforts by either sides, by both sides to take steps to improve the relationship.</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Thanks so much.&nbsp; I think we have time for just a couple more questions before our speaker has to hop.&nbsp; Why don&#8217;t we go to Paris Huang with the Voice of America next.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hello.&nbsp; Hi, thank you for doing this.&nbsp; So, earlier you mentioned about the &#8212; part of this visit is for us to ensure the peace and stability in East Asia.&nbsp; I just would like to clarify: Is that specifically means Taiwan?&nbsp; And what is your assessment on President Yoon&#8217;s attitude toward issues around China and Taiwan?&nbsp; And will the language be clearly written in a joint statement?&nbsp; So, that&#8217;s the first question.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The second, on the Quad: Is the Biden administration &#8212; on the expansion of &#8220;Quad Plus&#8221; &#8212; or is South Korea directly involved with the Quad summit on this time?&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Okay, great.&nbsp; So, let me take the first question.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Look, when we talk about maintaining peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region, we&#8217;re clearly talking about the entire Indo-Pacific region.&nbsp; There are a number of areas where there are challenges, and I would note that, you know, very clearly the leaders will be talking about one that is closer to where we are now.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But I think that it&#8217;s clear that, you know, both countries have a very strong interest in preserving peace and stability.&nbsp; I think you can expect the leaders to talk about that and to look for ways in which we can work more effectively together to do that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think, on the issue of the Quad, I don&#8217;t want to get ahead of the discussions.&nbsp; Obviously, you know, I think that this is a topic of great interest.&nbsp; I think that we don&#8217;t want to get ahead of the discussion with the leaders, but, also, I think that we have to recognize that the Quad is still developing, and so we&#8217;re looking for ways in which we can reinforce and strengthen what we&#8217;ve done so far.&nbsp; But at the same time, I think that we welcome any support for the Quad.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But I think that the issue of participation is one that we will still be working on.&nbsp; I think that you can expect &#8212; you know, I am biased, but I think you can expect that a joint statement will be clear.&nbsp; And I think we look forward to being able to, you know, really highlight how much we have in common, how similar our viewpoints are on a very wide range of issues, how close the two countries are, and how much we expect them to come closer on a very wide range of issues dealing with the challenges of today, but also challenges that we have (inaudible) to working on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think one of the things that, you know, for us &#8212; and this is not just a visit in Seoul today; this is about the entire trip &#8212; this is about demonstrating the unity and resolve and strengthening the coordination between our closest allies and &#8212; or two of our closest allies, and also strengthening our alliances to deal with problems that we are all dealing with today.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, I think that we&#8217;re very optimistic that we are &#8212; you know, we&#8217;ve done a great deal of groundwork.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think we have to really recognize &#8212; and I&#8217;d ask everyone to just be very sensitive to this &#8212; this is day 11 for the Yoon administration.&nbsp; This is the earliest that we&#8217;ve ever had an American President visit an ROK President in an ROK President&#8217;s time in office.&nbsp; It is normal that in &#8212; you know, in 11 days, it takes a while for an administration to come up to speed.&nbsp; We&#8217;re very impressed with what the Yoon administration has done.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We&#8217;re very happy with the work we&#8217;ve been able to do together, but I think it&#8217;s also important to recognize that it is unrealistic to expect any administration to have fully settled in only 11 days.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So we think that we&#8217;ve done quite well.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re very, very impressed by what&#8217;s been done and by the spirit of partnership, the spirit of tru- &#8212; of really genuine allies who are used to being together when times are bad, as well as when times are good.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re confident that that&#8217;s going to continue, and that we&#8217;ll be able to highlight the way forward for the alliance.</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Thanks so much.&nbsp; And I think we&#8217;ve got time for one last question.&nbsp; So last question.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s go to MJ Lee with CNN.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Given that this bilateral meeting comes, as you just said, 11 days into President Yoon’s presidency and particularly given that he doesn&#8217;t have much of a foreign policy background: Are there areas you can point to where you all think, you know, there are serious question marks in terms of President Yoon’s positions on major foreign policy issues and where just the President &#8212; President Biden is keen on trying to draw him out today and gain a better understanding of where he stands?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Look, I would push back very hard against the premise of that.&nbsp; I think we are very impressed with the cohesion, the coherence, and the clarity of the Yoon administration&#8217;s vision for its &#8212; for the ROK, for the ROK-U.S. relationship and the ROK role in the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think that what &#8212; in our discussions with them &#8212; and look, I&#8217;ve done &#8212; I&#8217;ve been doing this for a long time &#8212; I think we&#8217;ve been very, very impressed with how focused and how clear they&#8217;ve been, how decisive they&#8217;ve been.&nbsp; And I think that reflects, in our view, a great deal of potential to really strengthen the alliance going forward.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think that, in terms of the President&#8217;s engagement with President Yoon, I think that, clearly, they’re going to &#8212; this &#8212; part of the purpose here is two leaders of countries who have a very, very vital relationship, a close alliance getting to know each other.&nbsp; I think you all know: There is no substitute for that kind of direct engagement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I think we got off to a very good start last night at the Samsung plant.&nbsp; I think that their interaction was very positive.&nbsp; And I think that, you know, it went very well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I know that the President was quite satisfied and quite impressed.&nbsp; We&#8217;re looking forward to more of that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think that part of this is obviously getting to understand each other &#8212; I think to understand each other&#8217;s worldviews.&nbsp; I think that the President has &#8212; looks forward to doing that and getting to know President Yoon.</p>



<p>But I think that this is done in the context of tremendous confidence in the Yoon administration’s commitment to the alliance and clarity of their vision on foreign policies issues.&nbsp; And I think that, you know, from our standpoint, this is about building on a very strong foundation, rather than trying to lay any groundwork.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Thanks so much.&nbsp; And thanks so much everybody for joining this morning.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a reminder, this call was on background, attributable to “senior administration officials,&#8221; and embargoed until the call concludes, which will be shortly.</p>



<p>Thanks so much for joining.&nbsp; And we, of course, will be in touch throughout the rest of the trip.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Today, President Biden announced that John Kirby, who is currently the Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs, will be the new National Security Council Coordinator for Strategic Communications at the White House. In&nbsp;this role, Kirby will coordinate interagency efforts to explain United States policy and will serve as a senior administration voice on related matters, including as appropriate at the White House podium. This position will be housed at the NSC and report to the National Security Advisor.</p>



<p><strong>Statement from President Biden:</strong></p>



<p>“John Kirby is uniquely qualified for this position, and I look forward to bringing his background, knowledge, and experience to the White House. From his work as the Assistant Secretary and Spokesperson at the State Department to his work at the Pentagon, most recently as Assistant to the Secretary for Public Affairs and Press Secretary, John understands the complexities of U.S. foreign and defense policy, and he will ably represent the Administration on important national security issues.”</p>



<p><strong>Statement from National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan:</strong></p>



<p>“I am proud to welcome John to the team.&nbsp; I’m excited to see him get to work on behalf of the president and the entire national security enterprise.”</p>



<p><strong>Statement from John Kirby:</strong></p>



<p>“I am incredibly honored to be given this opportunity to continue serving my country and this Administration. I am very grateful to President Biden for his confidence in me and to Secretary Austin for his tremendous support and leadership these last 18 months. Secretary Austin has been more than just my boss; he’s been a mentor and a confidante, and he has helped make me a better communicator. He has trusted me to speak for the Department, and he has trusted me to speak for him. Those are precious responsibilities, the weight of which I felt and respected every day. I thank him for that. I also thank my entire team at OSD Public Affairs. When I messed up, they fixed it. When I did well, they made it so. I’ve never known a better team of professionals. I am excited to start this next assignment very soon, but I will surely miss each and every one of them.”</p>

<p>John Kirby is currently the Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs. In this role, he advises Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks and serves as the Department’s chief spokesperson.

<p>The Administration disagrees with the court’s ruling, and the Department of Justice has announced that it will appeal this decision. The authority to set public health policy nationally should rest with the Centers for Disease Control, not with a single district court.&nbsp; However, in compliance with the court’s injunction, the Biden Administration will continue to enforce the CDC’s 2020 Title 42 public health authority pending the appeal.&nbsp; This means that migrants who attempt to enter the United States unlawfully will be subject to &nbsp;expulsion under Title 42, as well as immigration consequences such as removal under Title 8.</p>



<p>As the appeal proceeds, the Department of Homeland Security will continue planning for the eventual lifting of Title 42 in light of CDC’s public health judgment, at which point anyone who attempts to enter the country unlawfully will be subject to Title 8 Expedited Removal proceedings, if they do not have grounds to remain in the United States.</p>

<p>Americans across the country are back to work at a historic level. Right now, workers in Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, West Virginia, and Wisconsin are less likely to be unemployed than in any other time on record.&nbsp;The unemployment rate did not increase in any of our 50 states.</p>



<p>This news comes on the heels of new data showing that the number of Americans who are forced to rely on unemployment insurance programs for their support fell to its lowest level in over 52 years and that the economy has added more than 8 million jobs since I took office – more jobs on average per month than under any other President in history.</p>



<p>​This job creation is no accident – it’s the direct result of my economic plan to rebuild the economy from the bottom up and the middle out through the historic American Rescue Plan and a nationwide vaccination strategy. There is more work to do to build an economy that works for all Americans. Tackling inflation is my top priority. But we cannot lose sight of the fact that millions of workers are now able to better provide for themselves and their families and enjoy the dignity that a good-paying job provides.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>From sea to shining sea, whether in still or raging waters, America has always been a Nation of maritime travel.  Across our 25,000 miles of waterways and over 360 commercial ports, the United States Merchant Marine is integral to our Nation&#8217;s prosperity.  From helping move goods throughout the supply chain to supporting our troops wherever they are deployed, the Merchant Marine plays a vital role in the economic security and defense of our country.  On National Maritime Day and every day, we honor the Merchant Marines for their service and sacrifice and acknowledge their crucial role in protecting our Nation&#8217;s security and commerce.</p>



<p>Today, our Merchant Marine remains inextricably linked to our national and economic security and competitiveness.  Merchant mariners&#8217; legacy of perseverance and dedication is carried on by today&#8217;s civilian mariners.  As tyranny and violence again cause the tragic loss of innocent lives and senseless destruction in Europe, our merchant mariners have answered the call of duty by crewing vessels of our United States Ready Reserve, moving vital military cargo to help the Ukrainian people in their defense of freedom.</p>



<p>We also salute the remarkable efforts of our entire maritime industry throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.  They put the well-being of the American people first, risking their lives to ensure that essential cargoes of medical supplies and personal protective equipment were delivered to those in need across our Nation.</p>



<p>As we continue to build a better America, our Merchant Marine plays a pivotal role in securing our coastal and inland waterways so that they are open to trade.  No matter the hardship, mariners provide a smooth passage for America&#8217;s critical domestic goods and serve as stewards of our Nation&#8217;s trading gateways with the rest of the world.  My Administration continues its unwavering support of the United States Merchant Marine, as well as the Jones Act, which protects the integrity of our domestic maritime industry, supports hundreds of thousands of jobs, and contributes over $150 billion in economic benefits.</p>



<p>We also know that the future success of the vital maritime industry depends on its ability to attract the talent of all Americans and reflect the diversity of the Nation it serves.  That is why we are resolved to continue the urgent work of advancing diversity, equity, and inclusion in the ranks of the Merchant Marine and to end sexual assault, sexual harassment, and bullying in the workplace.</p>



<p>Our Nation&#8217;s merchant mariners serve with honor and integrity each and every day.  Today, we recognize their service and sacrifice and recommit ourselves to fulfilling the promises and uplifting the values that they continue to protect.</p>



<p>The Congress, by a joint resolution approved May 20, 1933, has designated May 22 of each year as &#8220;National Maritime Day&#8221; to commemorate the first transoceanic voyage by a steamship in 1819 by the S.S. Savannah.&nbsp; By this resolution, the Congress has authorized and requested the President to issue annually a proclamation calling for its appropriate observance. &nbsp;I also request that all ships sailing under the American flag dress ship on that day.</p>



<p>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 22, 2022, as National Maritime Day.  I call upon all Americans to observe this day and to celebrate the United States Merchant Marine and maritime industry with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.</p>



<p>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twentieth day of May, in the year of our Lord two&nbsp;thousand&nbsp;twenty-two, and of the Independence of the United&nbsp;States of&nbsp;America the two&nbsp;hundred and forty-sixth.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>On Armed Forces Day, we share our unending appreciation for the proud patriots who answer the call to serve, taking the sacred oath to defend our Constitution. &nbsp;The brave members of our Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Space Force, Coast Guard, and National Guard and Reserve forces represent the best of our Nation.&nbsp; Today and every day, we honor their immeasurable service on behalf of our grateful Nation.&nbsp;</p>



<p><br>On this special day of tribute, we recognize the sacrifices that our service members and their families make on our behalf, and we recommit to our solemn duty to support them as they protect us.&nbsp; Our Nation has a sacred obligation to properly equip and prepare our troops when we send them in to harm&#8217;s way and to support them &#8212; both while they are serving abroad and when they return home &#8212; as well as their families, caregivers, and survivors.&nbsp; We must meet this obligation.&nbsp;</p>



<p><br>My Administration&#8217;s unity agenda focuses on key issues that bring Americans together: &nbsp;supporting our veterans, beating the opioid epidemic, addressing our national mental health crisis, and ending cancer as we know it. &nbsp;Each of these issues impact our military community, and each is essential to meeting our obligation to our troops, their families, caregivers, and survivors.&nbsp; Mental health issues pose a real challenge to our service members and their families, and my Administration will continue to strengthen the tools, resources, and support for our military community so our brave service members, who have answered the call to serve, can thrive.&nbsp; This includes taking bold action to reduce suicide among service members, veterans, and their families.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><br>The success of our Armed Forces also rests on every member of our military community feeling that their safety and ability to prosper is prioritized as they defend our Nation.&nbsp; That is why my Administration is so focused on addressing the potential adverse consequences related to toxic exposures or exposures to other environmental hazards during deployment or in garrison. &nbsp;</p>



<p><br>Safety for our troops also means addressing the scourge of sexual harassment and sexual assault in our military. &nbsp;We have already taken important steps. &nbsp;In December, I was proud to sign into law historic military justice reforms as part of the 2022 National Defense Authorization Act. &nbsp;The Department of Defense is working to implement these critical changes, alongside recommendations from the Independent Review Commission on Sexual Assault in the Military for prevention, climate and culture, and victim care and support. &nbsp;Much work still lies ahead to deliver the progress that our troops deserve, and this will remain a top priority for my Administration. &nbsp;</p>



<p><br>Our diversity is one of our greatest strengths as a Nation, and we will continue to strive for our Armed Forces to reflect society at every level within its ranks. &nbsp;Ensuring equal opportunity and greater inclusivity will bolster the strength of our military and make sure every American knows they can succeed and thrive as a member of the United States Armed Forces.&nbsp; We&nbsp;are renewing our efforts to address the recruitment, retention, and well-being of women in the military as well as providing a path to service for other under-represented groups.&nbsp;</p>



<p><br>As we look around the world today, we are reminded again that freedom comes at great cost.&nbsp; Throughout our history, brave Americans have always stepped forward to defend our liberties &#8212; willing to pay the price to keep our country safe. &nbsp;Our Nation&#8217;s Armed Forces are the best in the world.&nbsp; And we know that it is not only the person who wears our Nation&#8217;s uniform that serves. Their loved ones serve as well.&nbsp; Today, we also honor the families, caregivers, and survivors of our Armed Forces &#8212; all those who sacrifice on our behalf and who give their all to support the service members they stand behind.</p>



<p>On Armed Forces Day, we salute our brave service members, whose dedication and sacrifice ensure that our Nation&#8217;s Armed Forces are unmatched in strength, unity, and resilience.&nbsp; They&nbsp;are the greatest fighting force the world has ever known.</p>



<p>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, and Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces of the United States, continuing the precedent of my predecessors in office, do hereby proclaim the third Saturday of each May as Armed Forces Day.</p>



<p><br>I direct the Secretary of Defense, on behalf of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Space Force, and the Secretary of Homeland Security on behalf of the Coast Guard, to plan for appropriate observances each year, with the Secretary of Defense responsible for soliciting the participation and cooperation of civil authorities and private citizens.&nbsp; I invite the Governors of the States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and other areas subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to provide for the observance of Armed Forces Day within their respective jurisdictions each year in an appropriate manner designed to increase public understanding and appreciation of the Armed Forces of the United States.&nbsp; I also invite veterans, civic leaders, and other organizations to join in the observance of Armed Forces Day each year.</p>



<p><br>Finally, I call upon all Americans to display the flag of the United States at their homes and businesses on Armed Forces Day, and I urge citizens to learn more about military service by attending and participating in the local observances of the day.</p>



<p><br>Proclamation 10210 of May 14, 2021, is hereby superseded.</p>



<p><br>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twentieth day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-sixth.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>Exploring America&#8217;s magnificent lakes, rivers, ponds, bays, and oceans has long been a favorite pastime for recreational boaters and a memorable way to discover our Nation&#8217;s natural treasures.&nbsp; As we prepare for warmer weather, and as more Americans take to the water, National Safe Boating Week reminds us of the importance of following responsible and safe boating practices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So many Americans enjoy recreational boating, and most trips are safe.  But many preventable accidents occur each year that result in tragic deaths and injuries.  Observing boating safety precautions is essential for all boaters, whether you are fishing, sailing, kayaking, or motoring.</p>



<p>Safe boating practices start well before the hull breaks the water&#8217;s surface.  Experts agree that taking a State-offered boating safety course is one of the best ways to minimize accidents.  Most boating fatalities involve boats whose operators &#8212; including paddlers in rentals &#8212; did not have proper boating safety education.  I urge all Americans to use the free assistance of the Coast Guard Auxiliary and America&#8217;s Boating Club to ensure that your vessels are safe and that operators have the tools they need to operate them safely.</p>



<p>I also call upon Americans to follow basic boating safety procedures and to always wear a life jacket to protect yourself and your loved ones.  In 2020, three-quarters of boating deaths were drownings, and nearly 7 out of every 8 drowning victims were not wearing a life jacket.  In addition, avoid using alcohol or drugs when operating a boat.  Alcohol continues to be a significant contributing factor in boating deaths, and its effects are compounded by water movement, exposure to the elements, and dynamic operating conditions.  Finally, wearing an engine cut-off switch link will stop the boat&#8217;s engine in the event the operator falls overboard, protecting everyone from vessel and propeller strikes.  By adhering to safe boating practices, Americans will be safer on the water while enjoying the boating season. </p>



<p>This week, we also pay tribute to the United States Coast Guard and the Federal, State, Tribal, and local partners who help save lives and protect us from accidents on the water.  This season, let us recommit to following basic boating safety procedures to prevent boating fatalities, avoid property damage, and help boaters stay safe as they enjoy the beauty of the open water. </p>



<p>In recognition of the importance of safe boating practices, the Congress, by joint resolution approved on June 4, 1958 (36 U.S.C. 131), as amended, has authorized and requested the President to proclaim annually the 7-day period before Memorial Day weekend as &#8220;National Safe Boating Week.&#8221;</p>



<p>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim May 21 through May 27, 2022, as National Safe Boating Week.  I encourage all Americans who participate in boating activities to observe this occasion by learning more about safe boating practices, and by taking advantage of boating safety education opportunities.  I also encourage the Governors of the States and Territories, and appropriate officials of all units of government, to join me in encouraging boating safety in every community.</p>



<p>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twentieth day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-sixth.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Samsung Electronics Pyeongtaek Campus<br>Pyeongtaek, Republic of Korea</p>



<p><br>7:47 P.M. KST</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Mr. President, thank you.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; You’re very generous.&nbsp; Thank you very much.&nbsp; Mr. President, thank you for that introduction.&nbsp; It’s wonderful to be back in the Republic of Korea.</p>



<p>President Yoon, I’m honor- &#8212; I’m honored by the welcome you’ve given me to your beautiful country, and congratulations again on your election &#8212; congratulations &#8212; and recent inauguration.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>I and my country look forward to a very productive few days together where we can get to know one another better and explore ways to take the alliance between the Republic of Korea and the United States to an even greater heights than it already exists.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And Vice Chairman Lee, thank you for welcoming us to this Samsung semiconductor facility.&nbsp; This is an auspicious start for my visit because it’s emblematic of the future of cooperation and innovation that our nations can and must build together.</p>



<p>I’m joined by my Secretary of Commerce &#8212; Secretary Raimondo is here in the front row &#8212; who is working every day to bring us closer to that goal.</p>



<p>I’ve just seen how this plant makes the most advanced semiconductor chips in the world.&nbsp; They’re a wonder of innovation and design, precision and manufacturing.</p>



<p>Semiconductors power our economies and enable our modern lives, from our automobiles to our smartphones to medical diagnostic equipment.</p>



<p>And when it comes to the most advanced chips, like the ones made here at Samsung &#8212; it&#8217;s only one of only three companies in the world that makes these chips.&nbsp; It’s an incredible &#8212; an incredible achievement.</p>



<p>Because these little chips, only a few nanometers thick, are the key to propelling us into the next era of humanity’s technological development: artificial intelligence, quantum technologies, 5G, and so very much more &#8212; things we haven’t even thought of at this point.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This plant also reflects the close bonds in innovation between our countries.&nbsp; Much of the technology and machinery that is used to make these chips was designed and produced in the United States.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And by uniting our skills and our technological know-how, it allows the production of chips that are critical to both our countries and are essential &#8212; essential &#8212; sectors of our global economy.</p>



<p>And thanks for the incredible $17 billion investment that Samsung announced last May, soon to the United States &#8212; to have a facility like this one that manufactures the most advanced chips in the world in <s>Tylor</s> [Taylor], Texas.  Thank you.  (Applause.)</p>



<p>This investment will create 3,000 new high-tech jobs in Texas and add &#8212; to add to 20,000 jobs Samsung already supports in the United States of America.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, I want to thank Samsung for their investment and for continuing to expand the very productive partnership between the Republic of Korea and the United States.</p>



<p>And I &#8212; I know that Samsung will also be working with Stellantis on a joint venture to build a new facility in the United States that will manufacture batteries for electric vehicles.</p>



<p>Inve- &#8212; Investments like these are going to help catapult us forward toward a clean energy future, which we both badly need, advancing our shared economic growth, our energy security, and our climate goals.</p>



<p>I also want to make clear that these are smart business decisions.&nbsp; Samsung investment of &#8212; didn’t invest $17 billion without, as we say in America, running the numbers.</p>



<p>The United States is a top destination for foreign direct investment, like the one Samsung is making, because we have world-class, highly skilled, and highly committed workers.</p>



<p>I urge Samsung and Stellantis and any company investing in the United States to enter into partnerships with our most highly skilled and dedicated and engaged workers you can find anywhere in the world: American union members.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Stellantis knows how much benefit comes from a successful relationship with a union in America.&nbsp; They have a national agreement with my friend Ray Curry and the United Auto Workers.</p>



<p>For every joint venture that manufactures electric vehicle batteries would be made stronger by collective bargaining relationships with America unions.</p>



<p>We also have outstanding, skilled, dedicated union building and construction trades workers ready to build the new Samsung facility in Texas.</p>



<p>So, let’s work together to make this happen and to get that plant built on time and on budget safely and efficiently.&nbsp; Because union labor means high-quality work that delivers the best possible return on investment.</p>



<p>The United States has premier colleges and universities; a culture that fosters innovation and entrepreneurship; a transparent and predictable legal system, where companies know their ideas and their investments will be protected.&nbsp; And my administration is doubling down on all of these strengths.</p>



<p>We’re investing more than $1 trillion to upgrade America’s infrastructure coast to coast over the next decade.</p>



<p>And hopefully soon, with the Bipartisan Innovation Act,</p>



<p>we will deliver historic federal investments in U.S. research and development, including funding for something called the CHIPS Act to revitalize the U.S. semiconductor industry.</p>



<p>Our two nations work together to make the best, most advanced technology in the world.&nbsp; And this factory is proof of that.</p>



<p>And that gives both the Republic of Korea and the United States a competitive edge in the global economy if &#8212; if &#8212; we can keep our supply chains resilient, reliable, and secure.</p>



<p>Over the last few years, we’ve seen just how critical it is.&nbsp; COVID-19 pandemic &#8212; the COVID-19 pandemic exposed the fragility of “just in time” supply chains.&nbsp; A global semiconductor shortage has caused a shortfall in consumer goods, especially automobiles, and it is contributing to higher prices around the world.</p>



<p>And now, Putin’s brutal and unprovoked war on Ukraine</p>



<p>has further spotlighted the need to secure our critical supply chains so that our economy &#8212; our economic and our national security are not dependent on countries that don&#8217;t share our values.</p>



<p>A critical component of how we&#8217;ll do that, in my view, is by working with close partners who do share our values, like the Republic of Korea, to secure more of what we need from our allies and partners and bolster our supply chain resilience.</p>



<p>That’s why our strategy is to build around strengthening our ties and our cooperation across the board.&nbsp; That’s how both our nations can improve our long-term resilience, increase our shared prosperity, and put our people in the best position to come out ahead in the competition for the 21st century.</p>



<p>And that’s why, Mr. President, I came to the Republic <s>in</s> [of] Korea on my first trip to Asia as President of the United States.  So much &#8212; so much of the future of the world is going to be written here in the Indo-Pacific over the next several decades.</p>



<p>We’re standing at an inflection point in history where the decisions we make today will have far-reaching impacts on the world we leave to our children tomorrow.</p>



<p>This vibrant democracy has become a powerhouse of global innovation by investing in educating its people.</p>



<p>And companies like Samsung that are driven by a responsible development of technology and innovation will be critical to shaping the future and the direction our two countries &#8212; the direction we both want to go.</p>



<p>So, this is the moment, in my view, to invest in one another, to deepen our business ties, to bring our people even closer together.</p>



<p>This is something President Yoon and I will be talking about on our visit later this &#8212; after this meeting and in the months ahead.&nbsp; Because the Alliance between the Republic of Korea and the United States of America is a linchpin of peace, stability, and prosperity for the region and the world that we seek.</p>



<p>So, thank you all very much and, President Moon [sic] &#8212; Yoon, thank you for everything you&#8217;ve done so far.  Appreciate it.  Thank you.  (Applause.)  </p>



<p>7:56 P.M. KST</p>
