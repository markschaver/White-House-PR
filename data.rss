<p class="has-text-align-center">Kantei<br>Tokyo, Japan</p>



<p>10:35 A.M. JST</p>



<p>PRIME MINISTER KISHIDA:&nbsp; (As interpreted.)&nbsp; Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.&nbsp; President Biden, Prime Minister Modi, Prime Minister Albanese: I am delighted to welcome my friends to Tokyo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In particular, I thank Prime Minister Albanese.&nbsp; Welcome to Tokyo.&nbsp; I would like to offer him my sincere congratulations for assuming the post of prime minister, and thank you very much for flying over to Japan right after the election.</p>



<p>Since last year, with Joe taking the leadership, our four countries were able to meet from time to time at the leaders’ level.&nbsp; Japan is taking over the baton this year, and I am truly happy that this time we are able to hold the Quad Summit in Tokyo.</p>



<p>A grave incident which has fundamentally shaken the rule-of-law-based international order we value has happened since we met last September.&nbsp; Russian invasion into Ukraine squarely challenges the principles which are enshrined in the United Nations Charter.&nbsp; We should never, ever allow a similar incident to happen in the Indo-Pacific.</p>



<p>Because of the harsh reality unfolding, it is extremely significant for us to get together and show to the international society the four countries&#8217; solidarity and our firm commitment toward the shared vision of free and open Indo-Pacific.</p>



<p>Today, as we meet in person, I am looking forward for a candid exchange of views on global and regional situations.</p>



<p>At the same time, I must say that without walking in step with the countries in the region, we cannot secure success for the Quad either.&nbsp; We should therefore listen carefully to the voices of the countries in the ASEAN, South Asia, as well as the Pacific Island countries so as to further advance cooperation conducive in solving urgent issues facing the region.</p>



<p>During this meeting, I wish to clarify the concrete progress of broad-based practical cooperation that we have worked so far and also to discuss on new areas of cooperation such as assisting in regional climate change countermeasures, maritime domain awareness, as well as humanitarian aid and disaster relief.</p>



<p>Now, first of all, may I invite Prime Minister Albanese to speak, please?</p>



<p>PRIME MINISTER ALBANESE:&nbsp; Well, Prime Minister Kishida, President Biden, and Prime Minister Modi: Firstly, can I thank you for your sincere congratulations on my election as Australia&#8217;s 31st prime minister.&nbsp; It is an honor that this is my first act as prime minister to attend this important Quad Leaders Meeting here in Japan.</p>



<p>And as we gather today, I acknowledge all that the Quad has achieved, standing together for a free, open, and resilient Indo-Pacific region and working together to tackle the biggest challenges of our time, including climate change and the security of our region.</p>



<p>My government is committed to working with your countries, and we are committed to the Quad.&nbsp; The new Australian government&#8217;s priorities align with the Quad agenda, taking action on climate change and building a stronger and more resilient Indo-Pacific region through better economic security, better cybersecurity, better energy security, and better environmental and health security.</p>



<p>Our cooperation is built on the values that we share: a commitment to representative democracy, the rule of law, and the right to live in peace.</p>



<p>Today, we look ahead to the work we&#8217;re yet to do.&nbsp; As the Indo-Pacific is reshaped, our Quad partnership is needed now more than ever to meet the challenges and threats of a less certain world; to shape that world for the better; and build a stronger, more cooperative Indo-Pacific region that respects sovereignty.</p>



<p>The region is looking to us to work with them and to lead by example.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why my government will take ambitious action on climate change and increase our support to partners in the region as they work to address it, including with new finance.</p>



<p>We will act in recognition that climate change is the main economic and security challenge for the island countries of the Pacific.</p>



<p>Under my government, Australia will set a new target to reduce emissions by 43 percent by 2030, putting us on track for net zero by 2050.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have had a change of government in Australia, but Australia&#8217;s commitment to the Quad has not changed and will not change.&nbsp; And our commitment to ASEAN and its centrality has not changed.</p>



<p>My government has already committed to a greater focus on Southeast Asia, including the appointment of a special envoy for the region and $470 million in additional foreign aid over the next four years.&nbsp; This is in addition to our increasing assistance to the Pacific by over half a billion dollars, deepening our defense and maritime cooperation and using the power of proximity to strengthen our partnerships.</p>



<p>We will bring more energy and more resources to securing our region as we enter a new and more complex phase in the Pacific&#8217;s strategic environment.&nbsp; And we will continue to stand with you, our likeminded friends.&nbsp; And collectively, we will continue to stand up for each other.</p>



<p>We will stand firm on our values and our beliefs on what we know will enhance the stability and prosperity of our region and what is firmly in the interests of all those who call the Indo- Pacific home.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m honored to be among such close friends of Australia to take these next steps with you to pursue positive and practical ways to support a free, open, and resilient Indo-Pacific.</p>



<p>I look forward to strengthening our Quad partnership, starting with a productive meeting today.&nbsp; And I&#8217;m delighted to hand over to Prime Minister Modi.</p>



<p>PRIME MINISTER KISHIDA:&nbsp; (As interpreted.)&nbsp; Thank you very much, Prime Minister Albanese.&nbsp; May I now ask the Prime Minister Modi to speak?</p>



<p>PRIME MINISTER MODI:&nbsp; (As interpreted.)&nbsp; Your Excellencies &#8212; Prime Minister Kishida, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, and President Biden.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Prime Minister Kishida, thank you very much for your wonderful hospitality.&nbsp; I am very pleased to be among friends today in Tokyo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>First of all, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, my heartfelt congratulations to you on your electoral victory.&nbsp; <a>Your being here with us within just 24 hours of your swearing-in demonstrates the strength of our friendship within the Quad and your commitment to it.</a></p>



<p>Excellencies, the Quad group has made an important place for itself on the global stage in a very short time today.&nbsp; The scope of the Quad has increased and also it is more influential.&nbsp; Our mutual trust, our determination are giving democratic forces a new energy and enthusiasm.</p>



<p>At the Quad level, mutual cooperation is encouraging a free, open, and inclusive Indo-Pacific region, which is a shared objective for all of us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite the difficult circumstances of COVID-19, we have increased mutual coordination in several areas such as vaccine delivery, climate action, supply chain resilience, disaster response, and economic cooperation.&nbsp; This is ensuring peace, prosperity, and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Quad is moving forward with a constructive agenda for the Indo-Pacific region.&nbsp; This will continue to strengthen the image of the Quad as a force for good.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thank you very much.&nbsp;</p>



<p>PRIME MINISTER KISHIDA:&nbsp; (As interpreted.)&nbsp; Thank you very much, Prime Minister Modi.</p>



<p>May I now invite President Biden.&nbsp; Joe, please.&nbsp;</p>



<p>PRESIDENT BIDEN:&nbsp; Thank you very much.&nbsp; It&#8217;s wonderful to be together with friends and &#8212; at this transformative moment in the world, and we are at a transformative moment.<br><br>Prime Minister Kishida, I want to commend you for the extraordinary leadership that, over the past few months, you&#8217;ve shown and for the gracious way in which you’ve hosted all of us.&nbsp;<br><br>And, Prime Minister Modi, it&#8217;s wonderful to see you again in person.&nbsp; The &#8212; and I thank you for your continuing commitment to making sure democracies deliver, because that&#8217;s what this is about: democracies versus autocracies.&nbsp; And we have to make sure we deliver.<br><br>Prime Minister Albanese, I welcome you to your first Quad meeting.&nbsp; Like I said, you got on a plane &#8212; you were sworn in and got on a plane.&nbsp; And I’m &#8212; if you fall asleep while you&#8217;re here, it&#8217;s okay.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Because I don&#8217;t know how you&#8217;re doing it.&nbsp; But &#8212; (laughs) &#8212; it is really quite extraordinary.&nbsp; Just getting off the campaign trail as well.<br><br>Congratulations on your election.&nbsp; As I told when you won &#8212; I called you &#8212; that we greatly appreciate your commitment of being here so soon after taking office.<br><br>Quad leaders met for the first time just over one year ago.&nbsp; It seems longer, but, to date, our partnership is central to achieving our goals and critical for the foundation of our continuing cooperation, in my view.<br><br>We already accomplished a great deal, as was referenced earlier: cooperating on COVID-19 response and health security &#8212; more to do, to state the obvious; partnering on 5G and technology supply chains, technology standards setting; and launching our &#8212; our Quad Fellowship Program, which I think can make a difference, which we talked about earlier.<br><br><a>At the same time, we&#8217;re navigating a dark hour in our shared history. &nbsp;The Russian brutal and unprovoked war against Ukraine has triggered a humanitarian catastrophe.&nbsp; And innocent civilians have [been] killed in the streets, and millions of refugees are internally displaced as well as exiled.</a><br><br>And this is more than just a European issue; it&#8217;s a global issue.&nbsp; The fact is that what &#8212; if you turn on the television and you&#8217;ll see what Russia is doing now, it appears to me that Putin is just trying to extinguish a culture.&nbsp; He&#8217;s not even aiming at military targets anymore; he&#8217;s taking out every school, every churc<a>h, every &#8212; every natural history museum as if to try to obliterate the Ukrainian culture.&nbsp; And the world has to deal with it, and we are.&nbsp;</a></p>



<p>The global food crisis is made worse by Russia’s blocking Ukraine from exporting its millions of tons of grain.&nbsp; And also, as long as Russia continues the war, the United States will work with our partners to help be the global response, because it&#8217;s going to affect all parts of the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the same time, the United States must and will be strong, steady, and an enduring partner in the Indo-Pacific.&nbsp; We are in the Indo-Pacific &#8212; we are &#8212; we are an Indo-Pacific power.</p>



<p>I was once asked by &#8212; well, I won’t go into it.&nbsp; But I was once asked by the leader of China why I kept talking about being an Indo-Pacific power.&nbsp; And I said, “Because we are.&nbsp; We share the Pacific &#8212; one entire side of our country.”&nbsp; And we have been deeply involved with all of you for a long time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As long as Russia continues this war, we&#8217;re going to continue to be partners and gle- &#8212; lead a global response.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, you know, we&#8217;re an Indo-Pacific power, as I said.&nbsp; We&#8217;re going to stand with you, our close democratic partners.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re going to stand for the shared values that &#8212; and the shared vision we all have.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You know, shortly before Russia launched this invasion, my administration published our Indo-Pacific strategy to advance a free, open, connected, secure, and resilient Indo-Pacific.</p>



<p>Russia’s assault on Ukraine only heightens the importance of those goals &#8212; the fundamental principles of international order, territorial integrity and sovereignty, international law.&nbsp; Human rights must always be defended, regardless of where they&#8217;re violated in the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, the Quad has a lot of work ahead of us.&nbsp; It’s &#8212; the fact of the matter is &#8212; and we&#8217;ve a lot of work to do keeping this region peaceful and stable; tackling this pandemic and the next one; and addressing the climate crisis, as referenced by our new colleague; ensuring that technologies of the future are governed according to our values &#8212; governed according to our values.</p>



<p>But a short time &#8212; in a short time, we&#8217;ve shown the Quad isn&#8217;t just a passing fad.&nbsp; We mean business.&nbsp; We&#8217;re here to get things done for the region.&nbsp; And I&#8217;m proud of what we&#8217;re building together.&nbsp; And I look forward to our vital partnership flourishing and for many years to come.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>In Tokyo, President Biden, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese of Australia, Prime Minister Modi of India, and Prime Minister Kishida of Japan will advance the Quad’s ambitious and diverse agenda, including through a major new initiative to improve maritime domain awareness across the Indo-Pacific.</em></p>



<p>The leaders of the Quad nations—Australia, India, Japan, and the United States—will meet on May 24, 2022 in Tokyo for the fourth time and the second time in person. Established in the wake of the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami to coordinate humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, the Quad has since become a leading regional partnership dedicated to advancing a common vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific through practical cooperation on diverse 21<sup>st</sup>-century challenges. With six leader-level working groups—on COVID-19 Response and Global Health Security, Climate, Critical and Emerging Technologies, Cyber, Space, and Infrastructure—the Quad is building habits of cooperation among our four countries that will support a more peaceful and prosperous Indo-Pacific. President Biden and his fellow Quad leaders welcome the following announcements from the Tokyo Summit:<br><br><strong>The Indo-Pacific Partnership for Maritime Domain Awareness  </strong><br><br>At the Tokyo Summit, the Quad leaders will welcome a major maritime initiative: <strong>the Indo-Pacific Partnership for Maritime Domain Awareness (IPMDA).</strong> In close consultations with regional partners, IPMDA will offer a near-real-time, integrated, and cost-effective maritime domain awareness picture. This initiative will transform the ability of partners in the Pacific Islands, Southeast Asia, and the Indian Ocean region to fully monitor the waters on their shores and, in turn, to uphold a free and open Indo-Pacific. Quad countries are committed to contributing to the region’s maritime domain awareness—a fundamental requirement for peace, stability, and prosperity—through an investment in IPMDA over five years. The partnership will innovate upon existing maritime domain awareness efforts, rapidly bringing emerging technologies to bear for the greater good of the Indo-Pacific community.<br></p>



<ul><li>IPMDA will build a <strong>faster, wider, and more accurate maritime picture</strong> of near-real-time activities in partners’ waters. This common operating picture will integrate three critical regions—<strong>the Pacific Islands</strong>, <strong>Southeast Asia</strong>, and <strong>the Indian Ocean region</strong>—in the Indo-Pacific. The benefits of this picture are vast: it will allow tracking of “dark shipping” and other tactical-level activities, such as rendezvous at sea, as well as improve partners’ ability to respond to climate and humanitarian events and to protect their fisheries, which are vital to many Indo-Pacific economies. IPMDA will do so by:<br><br><strong>Harnessing commercially-available data</strong> <strong>using existing technologies</strong>. Through a combination of Automatic Identification System and radio-frequency technologies, Quad partners can provide an unprecedented “common thread” of activities. Because of its commercial origin, this data will be unclassified, allowing the Quad to provide it to a wide range of partners who wish to benefit.<br><br><strong>Extending support for information-sharing across existing regional fusion centers</strong>, such as the Information Fusion Center-Indian Ocean Region, based in India; the Information Fusion Center, based in Singapore; the Pacific Islands Forum Fisheries Agency, based in the Solomon Islands, and the Pacific Fusion Center, based in Vanuatu, both of which receive support from Australia.<br></li><li>Quad partners will begin immediate consultations on this opportunity with partners in the region. As the initiative proceeds, the Quad will identify future technologies of promise, allowing IPMDA to remain a cutting-edge partnership that promotes peace and stability throughout the region.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p><strong>The Quad Fellowship</strong><br><br>Quad leaders are proud to open applications for the <strong>Quad Fellowship</strong>, which will sponsor 100 American, Australian, Indian, and Japanese students to study in the United States each year for graduate degrees in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. The Quad Fellowship empowers exceptional STEM graduate students to advance research and innovation throughout their careers with a lens of positive social impact. It does so by providing scholarships, immersive and inspiring events at the nexus of STEM and society, mentorship and career-advancing programming, and cross-cultural exchange opportunities.</p>



<ul><li>The Quad Fellowship <strong>application </strong><a href="http://www.quadfellowship.org/apply"><strong>is live</strong></a> and will remain open until June 30, 2022. The first class of Quad Fellows will arrive on campus in autumn 2023.</li></ul>



<p><strong>The Quad Vaccine Partnership and Global Health Security</strong><br><br>The Quad is committed to maintaining its global leadership in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic and bolstering global health security. To date, Quad partners have collectively provided 257 million safe and effective doses to the Indo-Pacific. Even as we continue to donate vaccines, we will adapt our collective approaches to and prepare for new variants, including by getting vaccines, tests, treatments, and other medical products to those at highest risk.</p>



<ul><li>The United States will provide <strong>COVID-19 boosters and pediatric doses</strong> to countries of greatest need, including in the Indo-Pacific.<br></li><li>The <strong>Biological E, Ltd facility in India</strong> will continue to use expanded vaccine-manufacturing capacity as part of the Quad Vaccine Partnership. Our support is building sustainable manufacturing capacity, including for booster shots, which will yield long-term benefit in the fight against COVID-19 and future pandemics.&nbsp;<br></li><li>The Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) and EXIM India decided to support a <strong>$100 million facility</strong>, which will bolster the Indian health care sector, including global capacity for COVID-19 countermeasures.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Climate</strong><br><br>The climate crisis is existential for each of our countries and for the Indo-Pacific. The Pacific Islands are particularly vulnerable; as the Pacific Island Forum’s Boe Declaration on Regional Security <a href="https://www.forumsec.org/2018/09/05/boe-declaration-on-regional-security/">states</a>, “climate change remains the single greatest threat to the livelihoods, security and wellbeing of the peoples of the Pacific.” After inaugurating a <strong>Climate Working Group</strong> at our first-ever leader summit, in March 2021, our four countries have meaningfully deepened and regularized our cooperation on meeting the climate crisis. The Quad leaders will launch further efforts on green shipping, energy supply chains, disaster risk reduction, and the exchange of climate information services.</p>



<ul><li>The Quad will broaden and elevate our work to combat climate change by inaugurating two ministerials in the coming months. U.S. Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg plans to convene <strong>Quad Transportation Ministers</strong> and relevant stakeholders to accelerate the work of the Shipping Task Force, including progress toward developing Green Shipping Corridors among Quad countries. U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm plans to meet with <strong>Quad Energy Ministers</strong> to catalyze Quad efforts to deploy clean hydrogen, minimize methane emissions, and develop a 10-Year Clean Energy Supply Chain Plan.<br></li><li>The Quad will cooperate on disaster risk reduction for extreme weather events, including through the <strong>Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI)</strong>, building on the Quad’s joint session on strengthening Indo-Pacific infrastructure and communities at the International CDRI conference.<br></li><li>The <strong>Quad Climate and Information Service Task Force</strong>, dedicated to integrating and facilitating climate information services to the broader Indo-Pacific, will convene other Indo-Pacific countries at the September Asia-Pacific Ministerial Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction in Brisbane, to share best practices and gauge user needs in the region.<br></li><li>The Quad will advance the development of <strong>clean hydrogen</strong> and <strong>clean ammonia</strong> <strong>fuels</strong> and launch a series of roundtables on mitigating methane emissions across our liquified natural gas (LNG) sectors. The Quad will also cooperate to enhance capacity in the broader Indo-Pacific region to participate in high-integrity carbon markets.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Critical and Emerging Technologies</strong><br><br>Our four countries are committed to responsible innovation in critical and emerging technologies. Since launching the <strong>Critical and Emerging Technologies Working Group</strong> at the first-ever leader-level summit of the Quad, in March 2021, Quad partners have mapped collective capacity and vulnerabilities in global semiconductor supply chains, and launched the <em>Common Statement of Principles on Critical Technology Supply Chains</em>, which will provide a cooperative foundation for enhancing supply-chain resilience in the region. At the same time, Quad partners are exploring ways to collaborate on the deployment of open and secure telecommunications technologies in the region, working with industry through Open RAN Track 1.5 dialogues.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Through a new <strong>Memorandum of Cooperation on 5G Supplier Diversification and Open RAN</strong>, the Quad will cooperate on technical exchanges and testbed activity to advance interoperability and telecommunications cybersecurity.<br></li><li>The Quad has advanced technical-standards cooperation through the International Telecommunication Union’s Telecommunication Standardization Sector and will redouble its efforts through the new <strong>International Standards Cooperation Network</strong>, a mechanism for like-minded allies and partners to share information on technical-standards activities and to increase situational awareness, coordination, and influence in international critical and emerging technologies standards.<br></li><li>To unlock opportunities in critical and emerging technologies through stronger engagement with the private sector, the Quad will convene industry partners to discuss business and investment issues. A <strong>Quad Investors Network</strong>, an independent consortium of investors that seeks to advance access to capital for critical and emerging technologies within and across the Quad, is being launched today.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Cybersecurity</strong><br><br>The <strong>Quad Cybersecurity Partnership</strong> seeks to build resilience across our four countries in response to cybersecurity vulnerabilities and cyber threats. Its areas of focus are critical-infrastructure protection, led by Australia; supply-chain resilience and security, led by India; workforce development and talent, led by Japan; and software security standards, led by the United States. Its work is guided by <strong>new joint cyber principles</strong> to improve cyber resilience in a rapidly changing threat environment. These principles aim to prevent cyber incidents, prepare national and international capabilities for potential cyber incidents, and/or respond quickly and effectively to a cyber incident, when or should one occur.</p>



<ul><li>The Quad will strengthen information-sharing among Quad country <strong>Computer Emergency Response Teams</strong> (CERT), including exchanges on lessons learned and best practices.<br></li><li>The Quad will improve software and Managed Service Provider (MSP) security by coordinating <strong>cybersecurity standards</strong> for Quad governments’ procurement of software.<br></li><li>Quad partners will launch a <strong>Cybersecurity Day campaign</strong>, open to countries across the Indo-Pacific and beyond, as part of our continuing efforts to strengthen cybersecurity awareness and action. This program will provide basic cybersecurity information and training to the most vulnerable sectors of our countries and regions, including schoolchildren, small businesses, and the elderly. Quad partners will lead this campaign in partnership with industry, non-profits, academia, and communities to maximize its effectiveness and reach.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Space</strong><br><br>As leaders in space, Quad countries are strengthening cooperation and pooling our collective expertise to exchange satellite data, enable capacity-building, and consult on norms and guidelines.</p>



<ul><li>Quad partners will strengthen their commitments to the free, full, and open <strong>sharing of space-based civil Earth observation data,</strong> and will jointly develop and promote the concept of Open Science in the region and globally.<br></li><li>The United States will coordinate with Quad partners on its <strong>cooperative civil Earth observation programs,</strong> to include the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) GLOBE and DEVELOP programs; the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Community Satellite Processing Package (CSPP) and Satellite Proving Ground Flood Mapping Portal; as well as the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) National Land Imaging Program.&nbsp;<br></li><li>As extreme weather events become ever more common in the Indo-Pacific, Quad partners will convene technical experts to drive new cooperation and set the stage for additional <strong>disaster mitigation</strong> and <strong>humanitarian assistance and disaster relief</strong> workshops or training among Quad partners.&nbsp;<br></li><li>The Quad partners intend to host a two-day workshop on implementation of the <strong>Long-Term Sustainability (LTS) Guidelines for Indo-Pacific</strong> countries focused on LTS implementation and on how LTS implementation can lead to positive changes in domestic policy, regulations, and outcomes.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Infrastructure</strong><br><br>To help meet the Indo-Pacific’s enormous infrastructure needs, Quad leaders launched the <strong>Quad Infrastructure Coordination Group</strong>, which will deepen collaboration and pursue complementary actions, including in digital connectivity, transportation infrastructure, clean energy and climate resilience.</p>



<ul><li>In Tokyo, the Quad’s respective heads of development-financing agencies met to discuss enhanced engagement to address the infrastructure-financing gap in the region. This high-level effort—which includes Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Export Finance Australia; India’s EXIM; Japan Bank for International Cooperation; and the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation—will coordinate our strategic approaches, among our countries and with the private sector, to leverage solutions-oriented tools that support investments in critical sectors such as healthcare, clean energy and climate, digital connectivity, sustainable infrastructure, and supply chains.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief</strong><br><br>The Quad was forged in the wake of the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami. In recognition of that history and of present-day threats, the Quad established a new humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HADR) mechanism.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Through the <strong>Quad Humanitarian and Disaster Relief Mechanism</strong>, Quad partners will be able to coordinate and mobilize our civilian-led disaster assistance efforts, with support from civil defense and military assets when needed, to respond to disasters in the Indo-Pacific. The Partnership provides a framework for Quad partners to coordinate on joint disaster responses and develop a greater understanding of their respective HADR operations. Quad partners may provide joint or coordinated assistance as requested by an affected state in the crisis-alert, crisis-response, or post-crisis-review phases of a disaster. Quad partners will also be able to work together to improve crisis preparedness and early warning.</li></ul>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Via Teleconference</p>



<p>8:24 A.M. JST<br>&nbsp;<br>MODERATOR: &nbsp;Good morning, everybody. &nbsp;Thanks so much for joining us. &nbsp;And apologies for the delay. &nbsp;As we said in the invite, this call is on background, attributable to senior administration officials and embargoed until the call concludes.<br>&nbsp;<br>Not for reporting but just for your knowledge, joining us again is [senior administration official]. &nbsp;I’m going to turn it over to [senior administration official].<br>&nbsp;<br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: &nbsp;Thank you very much. &nbsp;And thank you all for joining. &nbsp;I’d like to give a very quick preview of today’s Quad meetings, and then I’ll be happy to take some questions.<br>&nbsp;<br>I think as you all know, one of the very early decisions that the President made upon coming to office was to elevate the Quad to the leader level for the first time. &nbsp;And I’d note that the Quad meeting, which was virtual, given the pandemic at the time &#8212; or the situation &#8212; the pandemic situation at the time &#8212; was in March of 2021 &#8212; it was &#8212; and at that meeting, the leaders committed that they would meet in person, which they did, in September of 2021, at the White House, hosted by the President.<br>&nbsp;<br>And then they had another virtual meeting in early March, and then they had &#8212; are obviously meeting today in Tokyo for the second in-person meeting. &nbsp;And I think that it’s significant because this is an extraordinary trajectory and one that really reflects, I think, the administration’s focus on the region and its vision of how we can bring likeminded partners, likeminded democracies to work together to deal with common challenges and issues.<br>&nbsp;<br>I think what’s also very impressive is that in the space of, you know, 15 months, the Quad has become, essentially, an increasing cornerstone for &#8212; or fixtures &#8212; develop- &#8212; I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s developing into a cornerstone, and certainly it&#8217;s a fixture in regional &#8212; the regional order.<br>&nbsp;<br>And then I think that it reflects a commitment pile for countries to work together. &nbsp;It reflects also a sense that &#8212; you know, the goal here is not to create a lot of formal structures. &nbsp;The goal is to find ways to work together on issues that are of interest to the region and to try and really, in many ways, bring public goods to the region by harnessing the activities of all four countries, which are quite significant, to be able to address issues that matter across the Indo-Pacific.<br>&nbsp;<br>I don&#8217;t want to get ahead of the conversations with leaders, but I think we can preview some of the work that we expect to be announced. &nbsp;I think that at the Tokyo summit, the Quad leaders will welcome a major initiative on maritime domain awareness. &nbsp;And we expect it to be called the Indo-Pacific Partnership for Maritime Domain Awareness.<br>&nbsp;<br>In close consultation with regional partners, what we&#8217;re referring to is the IPMDA. &nbsp;And you know how government loves acronyms. &nbsp;IPMDA will offer a new real-time, integrated cost-effective maritime domain awareness picture. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And we believe that this addresses a real need and something that the administration has heard a true demand signal from almost across the region, be it from Southeast Asia, be it in the Pacific, be it in South Asia, which is for much better maritime domain awareness. &nbsp;The ability to know what is happening in countries’ territorial waters and in their exclusive economic zones.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And so the idea is the Quad partners will cooperate to help deliver this kind of capability across the region. &nbsp;And I think that, you know, we expect that this will integrate three critical regions &#8212; as I said, the Pacific Islands, Southeast Asia, and the Indian Ocean region &#8212; in the Indo-Pacific. &nbsp;And this will allow the tracking of dark shipping and other tactical-level activities, such as rendezvous at sea, as well as improves partners’ ability to respond to climate and humanitarian events, and to protect their fisheries, which are vital to so many Indo-Pacific economies.<br>&nbsp;<br>And the IPDMA [IPMDA] will do this by harnessing a combination of automatic identification system radiofrequency technologies. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The Quad partners will be able to bring all these together into an unprecedented common thread of activities, and the data will be unclassified, so &#8212; which will allow the Quad to provide it to a wide range of partners who wish to benefit. &nbsp;And it recognizes that the primary demand on this in many ways is not from militaries, it is for &#8212; for the equivalent of Coast Guards to be able to do both rescue at sea, to be able to monitor fishing, to be able to track illegal fishing.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And so I think that, you know, the way this will work is that there&#8217;ll be support for this information sharing across existing regional fusion centers, including in the different regions.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And I think that we are very &#8212; we’re very happy about the fact that there is a real demand, and we think that this will address it. &nbsp;And we look forward to continuing to work very closely with our partners, both in the Quad and across the region, to deliver a capability which we think will be very important to countries and really give them the tools they need to better maintain their sovereignty, better ensure &#8212; or better combat illegal fishing, and better be able to do rescue at sea and other humanitarian activities.<br>&nbsp;<br>The Quad leaders will also announce the opening of applications for the Quad fellowship, which will sponsor 100 American, Australian, Indian, and Japanese students to study in the United States each year for graduate degrees in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And then, in terms of COVID, there will be a discussion &#8212; and I think you should expect some announcements with regard to COVID-19 boosters and (inaudible) pediatric doses for countries in the greatest need, and obviously including in the Indo-Pacific.<br>&nbsp;<br>I think you’ll also see the Quad leaders announce a range of initiatives in the climate space, critical technologies, and cyber. &nbsp;And we’ll have more for you on that later today.<br>&nbsp;<br>And then I would note that there will be, I think, some discussions about issues of common interest to the Quad partners and to the leaders. &nbsp;And I think that they &#8212; if, you know, the past has taught us &#8212; they will have very direct, very candid conversations. &nbsp;I think that we’ve all been impressed at how comfortable the leaders are with each other and how comfortable they are having very, very serious conversations.<br>&nbsp;<br>I would note that there will be one significant development, which is there will be a new Australian leader. &nbsp;And we&#8217;re delighted that Prime Minister Albanese was sworn in yesterday and then almost immediately went &#8212; got on an airplane to come to Tokyo to participate in these meetings. &nbsp;As many of you saw, he mentioned in his acceptance speech about how he would be doing this. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And I think it&#8217;s also very significant that former Prime Minister Scott Morrison mentioned in his concession speech the importance of conceding so that there would be a new prime minister who will be able to come represent Australia at the Quad. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And I think that that really highlights the bipartisan support in Australia, as I think there is throughout the region &#8212; or throughout the Quad partners for the Quad &#8212; and, I think, a recognition of how quickly it has become a very critical element in each country&#8217;s foreign policy. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>In that vein, I would note that the President will have bilateral meetings with Prime Minister Modi of India and Prime Minister Albanese, and that will be his first meeting. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>I&#8217;m sure many of you are aware the President called him on the flight from Seoul to Tokyo, and they had a good conversation. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>We&#8217;ll have more on those meetings as they happen. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And with that, I will take your questions. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>MODERATOR: &nbsp;Thanks so much, everybody. &nbsp;Our speaker does have a little bit of a hard out, so we&#8217;re not going to be able to get through as many questions but we&#8217;re happy to try and take a couple. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>First, why don&#8217;t we go to Esther Oh with NHK.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;Hi. &nbsp;Thank you so much for taking my question. &nbsp;Does the President think that with India not being on board when it comes to condemning Russia, that it undermines the purpose of the Quad? &nbsp;Is he going to be having any discussions with Prime Minister Modi about the U.S. doing more for India so that India can diversify its military acquisition and oil imports so that it&#8217;s less dependent on Russia?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And my second question is: I know that the administration has said that there are no plans as of now to expand Quad membership. &nbsp;But why not take advantage of the situation and extend an invitation to likeminded allies in the region?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: &nbsp;So, thank you. &nbsp; And those are obviously both very topical questions. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>I&#8217;ll start off with the second one. &nbsp;I think that there is a recognition on the part of the Quad members and certainly the United States that there is interest, and growing interest, in the region, in the Quad.<br>&nbsp;<br>I think that the decision for the time being is that the Quad needs to build and reinforce itself and that the leaders, I think, are &#8212; have the common view that before thinking about possible expansion &#8212; and I would stress no decision has been made either way &#8212; the Quad needs to reinforce its ability to function. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And I would stress again: This is an ad hoc grouping. &nbsp;It doesn&#8217;t have letterhead. &nbsp;There&#8217;s no central secretariat or, you know, headquarters. &nbsp;This is four likeminded partners who work together. &nbsp;There&#8217;s an increasing array of working groups. &nbsp;And I think that the idea is to get those working well before thinking about what the next steps might be &#8212; and that&#8217;s to say without prejudging at all what those next steps are. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So, I think that that&#8217;s something that the leaders are very aware of &#8212; the strong interest &#8212; and that there is going to be continued thinking about it as the Quad is able to reinforce itself, develop itself, and continue to be effective and hopefully become more effective going forward. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>With regard to your questions about the discussions with the Prime Minister of India, I think that the President is very aware that countries have their own histories, they have their own interests, they have their own outlooks. &nbsp;And the idea is to build on the commonalities.<br>&nbsp;<br>Inevitably &#8212; and I think it&#8217;s true, with all the members of the Quad, there are some differences &#8212; the question is how they become &#8212; how they&#8217;re addressed and how they&#8217;re managed.<br>&nbsp;<br>And I think the President is very much of the view that the way to do this is to have candid and direct conversations of the kind that really can only happen when leaders meet and are able to see each other in person and speak their minds. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And I think that the President is very aware that India has its own history, its own views, and that, you know, at the same time, having these kinds of conversation helps him to understand the Indian perspective and, I think, allows India and Prime Minister Modi to understand his own perspective and to look for areas of common ground. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And I think that there is a broad understanding of the fact that what is happening in Ukraine is a serious threat to the international order. &nbsp;I think that the issue is how the countries are better able to work together to try and find common ground to address it. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And the &#8212; I think you can expect the President also to talk to India, talk to Prime Minister Modi about how the U.S. and India can continue the really extraordinary work that has been done over the past 22 years to strengthen and develop the relationship. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>I think it is quite significant that we are now at the fifth U.S. president, the third Indian prime minister &#8212; from both parties in each country &#8212; that have made very significant efforts to strengthen the bilateral relationship. &nbsp;And I think that that&#8217;s something the President appreciates and that you can expect to see continued. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>MODERATOR: &nbsp;Thanks so much. &nbsp;Next, let&#8217;s go to Patsy from Voice of America. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;Hello, thank you for doing this. &nbsp;My question is about the specifics of the COVID commitments that you mentioned about the pediatric doses. &nbsp;I&#8217;m curious to know how it relates to the already existing commitment that was made by the Quad &#8212; I believe it was March of 2021 &#8212; to deliver a billion doses, mostly to Southeast Asian countries.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>As I understand, that commitment has not been fulfilled because of the Indian manufacturer having issues with WHO approval. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So is that going to be part of that or in addition to that? &nbsp;And just, kind of, if you could, give us an update on the status of that 1 billion doses commitment. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Thank you. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: &nbsp;Thank you very much. &nbsp;And that&#8217;s a great question. &nbsp;I think that, you know, you obviously are tracking some of the issues that have come up.<br>&nbsp;<br>I think that it&#8217;s worth highlighting that what the Quad partners committed to a year ago was to increase production capacity and, at the same time, to deliver doses. &nbsp;And I think that, to date, the Quad partners have collectively provided over 257 million safe and effective doses to the Indo-Pacific.<br>&nbsp;<br>And I think that that is, in our view, a fairly significant number. &nbsp;And at the same time, the investment in expanding capacity has clearly happened.<br>&nbsp;<br>You&#8217;re absolutely right that they&#8217;re still waiting for a final approval from the World Health Organization. &nbsp;I think that, you know, that one of the things that the Quad partners are committed to is making sure that doses are safe and effective, and not trying to do anything to try and prejudge the approval process.<br>&nbsp;<br>So we&#8217;re very proud of the work that has been done. &nbsp;I think that it is impressive. &nbsp;And I think that you will see that there will be the continued production doses. &nbsp;And I think we all are aware there&#8217;s going to be a need for boosters, there&#8217;s going to be a continued demand for doses. &nbsp;And I think that the Quad partners have shown a willingness and ability to try and meet that demand.<br>&nbsp;<br>I think that you&#8217;re going to see, over the course of the rest of this year, a continued flow of doses. &nbsp;And we look forward to being able to show, at the end of the year, how far the Quad came in terms of meeting and upholding its commitments.<br>&nbsp;<br>MODERATOR: &nbsp;Thanks so much, everyone. &nbsp;And as I mentioned, our speaker unfortunately has to run to another commitment. &nbsp;So that&#8217;s all the time we have for today.<br>&nbsp;<br>As a reminder, this call is on background, attributable to “senior administration officials,” and embargoed until the call concludes, which will be shortly.<br>&nbsp;<br>Thank you, everybody.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Children’s National Hospital<br><em>     Washington, D.C.</em></em></p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">2:58 P.M. EDT<br><br>THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Good afternoon, everyone.  Good afternoon.  Monique and I were talking backstage, and I was asking her about her work.  And she said, “I &#8212; I can’t imagine doing anything else.”  In the midst of all that all of you do every day and what you endure &#8212; and I asked you the same thing &#8212; “Would you do anything else?” &#8212; you haven’t quit yet.  (Laughter.)  And it’s because I know you’re not the quitting type, at all.<br><br>And &#8212; and I do truly believe that the work that all of you do is an extraordinary gift that you have and that you give.  And so it was very important to me and to the President that we would be here today to say thank you to all of you.  Thank you.<br> <br>And, Monique, thank you for sharing your story and for the 16 years of dedicated service you have provided.<br> <br>So before I begin talking a bit more about the issue of the importance of mental health, I do want to start by providing an update about the infant formula shortage.<br> <br>The first military plane landed yesterday with more than 70,000 pounds of specialty formula, and the second will arrive later this week.<br> <br>I know this is a scary situation for our parents and the caregivers who are taking care of these babies.  Our administration is working around the clock to ensure that there is enough safe baby formula available for all who need it.  And it is truly one of our highest priorities.<br> <br>So, today &#8212; (applause) &#8212; okay, yes.  And collectively, I know, one of our highest priorities.<br><br>We&#8217;re here today to talk about improving the mental healthcare and wellness of healthcare workers.  And it is my honor to be here, of course, with our Surgeon General, Vivek Murthy.<br> <br>Dr. Murthy, I will say that you have done extraordinary work over your career, and in particular, you have been tireless in the fight against COVID-19.  And you have been &#8212; and I have witnessed it since the first days of our administration &#8212; a trusted voice throughout the pandemic.  So, on behalf of our nation, thank you, Dr. Murthy.  Thank you.  (Applause.) <br> <br>And I’m also very proud to be here with the folks who make Children’s National the outstanding facility it is: the doctors, the nurses, the healthcare aides, the hospital staff, and support staff.<br> <br>All of you who have chosen to live a life that is a life of service and, in particular, a life that is about our children and healing them, protecting them, and caring for them in the way that you do, in the way that I know is very personal.<br><br>And I will tell you, I &#8212; I &#8212; most of my career &#8212; in fact, all of my career &#8212; children have been one of my main areas of focus &#8212; what we can do to protect them, to keep them safe, to protect their wellbeing, and to nurture them in all the ways we know we have a responsibility as a society to do.<br> <br>You know, when we talk about our children &#8212; I know for this group, we all believe that when we talk about the children of the community, they are a children of the community.  And in that way, we should all feel a direct sense of responsibility for their wellbeing.<br><br>When I was a young prosecutor many years ago, I saw firsthand how adverse childhood experiences can have a lasting effect on mental health.  And for decades, I have fought to improve children&#8217;s health and wellbeing.<br> <br>As District Attorney of San Francisco, I helped launch the Center for Youth Wellness to support children who were dealing with the effects of trauma.<br> <br>And as Attorney General of California, I launched a new bureau of the California Department of Justice that I named the Bureau of Children’s Justice to protect children from the types of trauma that can have lifelong effect.<br> <br>I believe that the work that you all do to help the children and families of this community and of our country is truly remarkable work.<br><br>For many of the people who come through the doors of this hospital, they spend time here that is probably one of the most difficult times in their lives.<br> <br>And as doctors, as nurses, as staff, you provide life-saving medical care.  And you also offer comfort at a time when it is most needed.  Your compassion, I truly believe, is light in the midst of darkness, often.  And you do so much to take care of your patients in their time of need, which is why I’m here to say we need to do a better job of taking care of you.<br> <br>The COVID-19 pandemic has, of course, brought increased attention to the mental health of workers in our healthcare system.  And we have asked so much of you over the course of these last two-plus years.<br><br>Some of you held the hands of those who were dying on behalf of their loved ones.<br> <br>All of you worked around the clock long before we understood how COVID-19 spread or what it did to the body.  And before you were even vaccinated or had protective equipment &#8212; the kind you needed &#8212; you were still here doing this work around the clock.<br> <br>You spent hour after hour, many in a windowless room, unable to speak about how you were feeling or only being able to speak with a small group who truly could understand what you were going through.  But you did it nonetheless.<br> <br>So there is an urgent need that we have, I believe, to address all of this and to address, of course, what has resulted: the stress, the burnout, the mental health challenges that you experienced most recently because of the pandemic. <br><br>Yet, I will also say, and we know, the problem existed, this burnout issue existed even before the pandemic.  And I’d like to recognize and thank the unions who are here who have long been a leading voice on this issue.<br> <br>And, you know, the term “burnout” was originally coined in the 1970s by a psychologist to describe the mental repercussions he experienced while working in a clinic.<br> <br>The choice to dedicate your life to helping people is a noble one, but too often it requires that you sacrifice so much of yourself.<br> <br>In 2019, more than half of all healthcare workers reported feeling burnt out.  And that was &#8212; again, that was before the pandemic.<br> <br>Each of you made enormous sacrifices to save lives under impossible conditions, which is why President Joe Biden and I are fighting to transform how mental health is understood, perceived, and treated for all Americans and, in particular, for our health workers.<br> <br>You deserve access to the mental healthcare that you need.  You deserve support and understanding when you are struggling.  And you deserve working conditions that support your mental health.<br> <br>That is why our administration has invested more than $100 million to expand mental health resources, including funding for healthcare organizations to create evidence-based programs around mental health and wellbeing for their employees.<br> <br>In addition, we have dedicated $200 million to train the next generation of community health workers, including workers who specialize in mental healthcare and are also a trusted voice in their communities.<br> <br>And today, Dr. Murthy released a new Surgeon General’s advisory to address health worker burnout.  It will include practical guidance about how to make workplace conditions safer, and it will recommend eliminating policies that punish people who seek help for mental health or addiction.<br> <br>I urge hospital systems and administrators to follow the Surgeon General&#8217;s advisory.<br><br>You know, the bottom line is this.  On this issue of mental health, you know, one way to think of it is this: If you knew someone who broke their arm, you would help them.  You would make sure they went to the hospital to get a cast.  And after they came home &#8212; well, on their way home, you’d probably open the door for them, you’d help them when they got home to get the support they need to heal through the point that they are feeling pain and then just need to heal.<br> <br>We have to do the same when it comes to mental health.  I think for too long our system has failed to understand the significance of this.  I think for too long, when we think about healthcare, we act as though the body just starts from the neck down, instead of understanding we also need to address healthcare from the neck up: mental health.<br><br>So, if you are struggling, please know you are not alone, that you are seen, and that you deserve to receive the help you desire and the help you need.<br> <br>The President and I are fighting to expand mental healthcare for all Americans because everyone should have access to the support they need to thrive.<br> <br>So, with that, I thank you all again, each one of you, for the work you do.  You are the angels walking among us.  Thank you.  (Applause.)<br> <br> END                3:09 P.M. EDT<br><br></p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Akasaka Palace<br>Tokyo, Japan</p>



<p>2:16 P.M. JST<br><br>PRIME MINISTER KISHIDA:&nbsp; &nbsp;(As interpreted.)&nbsp; Well, thank you.&nbsp; We are immensely pleased with President Biden’s first visit to Japan as the President of the United States.<br><br>The United States is Japan’s only ally who shares the universal values of freedom, democracy, human rights, and rule of law.<br><br>It goes without saying that Japan-U.S. alliance is the linchpin of Japan&#8217;s diplomatic and security policy.&nbsp; The Japan-U.S. summit this time, in this context, was more important than ever in respect of two points.<br><br>For one, we are currently faced with a crisis that shakes the foundation of international order, which is Russia&#8217;s aggression against Ukraine.&nbsp; To defend a resolutely free and open international order based on the rule of law, unity amongst allies and likeminded countries are required utmost now than any other.<br><br>Another thing is that the challenge of ensuring peace and prosperity of the Indo-Pacific region is the most important strategic issue for the international community, and Japan and the United States are thought to take on leadership role.&nbsp;<br><br>In this sense, we highly value the visit by President Biden to Japan, as it powerfully demonstrates United States&#8217; enhanced engagement in this part of the region.<br><br>Also, together with President Biden, we will later make tomorrow&#8217;s Quad Summit a sure success.<br><br>Based on this common awareness, today, frank and useful discussion took place on matters of international community.<br><br>First, on Russia’s egregious aggression, unilateral attempt to change the status quo by force is totally unacceptable.&nbsp; Regardless of location, we reaffirm to respond resolutely together with the international community, including G7.<br><br>Also, confirmation was made to support fully the government and people of Ukraine.&nbsp;<br><br>We also discussed the impact the Ukraine situation could give on the Indo-Pacific.&nbsp;<br><br>For China, we concurred to monitor closely recent activities of Chinese navy and joint military exercise of China and Russia, and strongly oppose the attempt to change the status quo by force.<br><br>In East China Sea and South China Sea, the Japan and the United States will closely cooperate on responding to China-related issue, including human rights.<br><br>Also, we affirmed that our two countries’ basic position on Taiwan remains to be unchanged; and underscored the importance of peace and stability of Taiwan Straits, which is an indispensable element for peace and prosperity of the international community; and called for peaceful resolution of Cross-Strait issue.<br><br>On DPRK, sharing the serious concern over nuclear and missile issues, including the launch of ICBM-class ballistic missiles.&nbsp; Japan and the United States and Japan-U.S.-ROK to cooperate to even more closely was affirmed.<br><br>Toward immediate resolution of abduction issue, I reiterated my request for full understanding and cooperation.&nbsp; President Biden extended his strong support.&nbsp; After this, President Biden will be meeting with family members of the abductees.&nbsp;<br><br>At a time when regional security environment is becoming more severe, with President Biden we affirmed the need to quickly reinforce the deterrence and response capability of Japan-U.S. alliances.&nbsp; I stated my determination to fundamentally reinforce Japan&#8217;s defense capabilities and secure a substantial increase of its defense budget needed to effect it.&nbsp; President Biden strongly supported my determination.<br><br>We also concurred to expand and deepen security and defense cooperation between Japan and the United States.&nbsp; Further, President Biden reiterated his commitment to Japan&#8217;s defense.&nbsp; And to make sure that extended deterrence will remain unwavering, we concurred to keeping close touch, including on the ministerial level, between our two countries.<br><br>In addition, to alleviate the impact on local communities of Okinawa and others, we also concurred to steadfastly implement U.S. forces in Japan realignment, including construction in Henoko of replacement facilities Futenma Air Station.&nbsp;<br><br>And because situation around the nuclear weapons are getting severe, we also concurred at once realistic and effective efforts on nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation, and work toward a world without nuclear weapons.<br><br>Engagement in the Indo-Pacific by the United States, and especially in the economic order, is becoming ever more important.&nbsp; Japan welcomes the launch of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework &#8212; IPEF &#8212; by President Biden, and will participate and cooperate in this initiative.&nbsp; Having said so, Japan hopes to see the United States return to the TPP from a strategic perspective.&nbsp;<br><br>Also, in order to expand and deepen Japan-U.S. economic cooperation, we agreed to hold the ministerial-level Japan-U.S. Economic Policy Consultative Committee, the so-called economic 2+2, coming July.<br><br>Further, we concurred on cooperation in economic security, including the development of advanced semiconductors and specific cooperation regarding space.<br><br>With Russia&#8217;s aggression of Ukraine severely damaging the situation over energy and food, we confirmed that we shall respond through coordination with the G7 and likeminded nations, as well as with international organizations.&nbsp; Through such cooperation, Japan and the United States hopes to engage in initiatives to realize a sustainable and inclusive social economic environment.<br><br>Regarding the new form of capitalism, which I am proposing, President Biden reconfirmed his strong support.&nbsp; By cooperating with President Biden, who is promoting policies that focus on the middle class, we hope to create a major global trend of common economic policies among major countries.<br><br>We also exchanged views on global health, cancer research, climate change, production and promotion of human rights and democracy, and other global challenges, and agreed that our two countries should lead efforts of the international community in such areas.<br><br>Further, I expressed the necessity to reform and strengthen the United Nations, including the Security Council, which bears an important responsibility for the peace and security of the international community, and gained President Biden&#8217;s support.<br><br>The President stated that the United States will support Japan becoming a permanent member of a reformed Security Council.&nbsp;<br><br>&#8220;The Pacific Ocean does not separate Japan and the United States.&nbsp; Rather, it unites us.”&nbsp; Those are the words delivered by President Kennedy to Prime Minister Ikeda, which resonate with amplified weight in today&#8217;s context.</p>



<p>I conveyed the importance of human resources development and people-to-people exchange towards a free and open Indo-Pacific, and President Biden concurred.</p>



<p>Japan will hold the presidency of the G7 next year.&nbsp; As the world faces an unprecedented challenge caused by Russia&#8217;s aggression of Ukraine and the heightened risk of use of weapons of mass destruction, at next year&#8217;s G7 Summit I hope we can demonstrate the will of the G7 to resolutely reject aggression by force, threat by nuclear weapons, and attempts to overturn the international order with a strength that will make a mark in history.</p>



<p>As the Prime Minister of Japan, the only country to have ever suffered atomic bombings, I believe there is no other venue as fitting as Hiroshima to demonstrate our commitment to peace.&nbsp;<br><br>I hope that we can vow to the world that mankind will never cause the catastrophe brought about by nuclear weapons, that President Biden and other leaders of the G7 will together confirm in front of the Peace Memorial on solidarity to defend peace, global order, and values.</p>



<p>I explained such plans to the President.&nbsp; And we reaffirmed that next year&#8217;s G7 Summit will be held in Hiroshima and that we shall work together for its success.</p>



<p>Today, as an outcome of our meeting, we decided to issue a joint statement.&nbsp; This statement is the joint strategy of Japan and the United States as we keep in mind the current situation in Ukraine and the strategic importance of the Indo-Pacific and aim to uphold and develop a free and open international order.</p>



<p>Under the current situation of international affairs, which may be described as the end of the post-Cold War era, the true value of the Japan-U.S. alliance is being tested more stringently than ever before.</p>



<p>In order to realize a free and open Indo-Pacific and to establish a free and open rules-based international order, Japan and the United States will engage in utmost efforts with irreversible resolve.&nbsp; I look forward to furthering our partnership with President Biden.<br>Thank you, Joe.&nbsp; Thank you very much.</p>



<p>I now would like to give the floor to President Biden of the United States of America.</p>



<p>PRESIDENT BIDEN:&nbsp; Thank you very much, Prime Minister, for that warm welcome you’ve given me here in Japan.<br><br>In recent years, the alliance between Japan and the United States has grown stronger, deeper, and more capable as we work together to take on the challenges &#8212; just as important as the opportunities &#8212; of a rapidly changing world.<br><br>A great example of this: We viewed Japan’s lunar rover just coming out here &#8212; over out here &#8212; before &#8212; after lunch.&nbsp; A symbol of how our space cooperation is taking off, looking toward the moon and to Mars.<br><br>And I’m excited &#8212; I’m excited at the work we will do together on the Gateway Station around the moon, and I look forward to the first Japanese astronaut joining us on the mission to the lunar surface under the Artemis program.<br><br>And tomorrow, we’re going to meet with the fel- &#8212; our fellow Quad partners, Australia and India, for our fourth Leaders&#8217; Summit, and our second time meeting together in person.<br><br>The Quad is showing the world that cooperation among democracies can get big things done, and I am grateful for your leadership.<br><br>And thank you for bringing us all together again to keep driving our progress as we advance a positive vision for the future of the Indo-Pacific region.<br><br>Today, we made several commitments to further increase our bilateral cooperation and to work together to ensure a free and open Indo-Pacific that creates opportunity and prosperity for all the people in the region.<br><br>Through our comprehensive and reliance &#8212; excuse me &#8212; and Resilience Partnership, which we announced last year, we’re in a situation now that we’ve invested our cooperation to spur innovation while delivering concrete progress for our people:<br><br>Promoting a secure 5G network and improving Internet connectivity for our partners in the region.<br><br>Improving critical infrastructure and strengthening supply chain resilience, particularly on semiconductors, batteries, and critical minerals.<br><br>Responding to COVID-19 and building a greater health security and stronger health system is also part of the future, and helping the world prepare for the next pandemic with our new CDC regional office right here in Japan.<br><br>Cooperating on clean energy and decarbonization to tackle the climate crisis.<br><br>And after this, the United States and Japan, together with 11 other nations, will be launching the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework.<br><br>This framework is a commitment to working with our close friends and partners in the region on challenges that matter most to ensuring economic competitiveness in the 21st century &#8212; by improving security and trust in the digital economy, protecting workers, strengthening supply chains, and tackling corruption that robs nations of their ability to serve their citizens.<br><br>You know, the two lis- &#8212; the two largest democracies &#8212; the two largest economic &#8212; economies in the democratic world, the United States and Japan, are demonstrating the strength of democracies in action.<br><br>Our cooperation has been particularly vital in organizing the global response to hold Putin accountable for his brutal war in Ukraine and his attack on the norms and principles that are the foundation of our international order.<br><br>Mr. Prime Minister, you’ve been outstanding; you’ve been an outstanding partner throughout this crisis.&nbsp; And our unity in the G7 to impose economic costs on Russia and support the people of Ukraine is sending a strong message about our willingness to defend a rule-based international order.&nbsp;<br><br>And I’m looking forward to continuing our discussions at the upcoming G7 Summit in Germany and returning to Japan next year, in 2023, for the G7 Summit.&nbsp; And I welcome the Prime Minister’s announcement that the G7 Summit will take place in his hometown of Hiroshima.&nbsp;<br><br>Today, we also discussed ways to continue to strengthen our security cooperation.<br><br>The United States remains fully committed to Japan’s defense, and we welcome &#8212; we welcome the opportunity to work more closely together in an increasingly challenging security environment.<br><br>I applaud Prime Minister Kishida’s determination to strengthen Japanese defense capabilities as well.<br><br>A strong Japan and a strong U.S.-Japan alliance is a force for good in the region.&nbsp; I support the peace and stability that’s going to continue and, we hope, increase across the Taiwan Straits; promote freedom of navigation in the East and South China Seas; and to deter the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.<br><br>So, thank you again, Mr. Prime Minister, for your partnership and your friendship.<br><br>The alliance between our two countries is stronger than it’s ever been and it’s as important as it has ever been.<br><br>I’m looking forward to exploring even more ways that our relationship will help move us toward a future that benefits all people.<br><br>So, thank you very much, Mr. <s>President</s> [Prime Minister].&nbsp; And I really, truly, appreciate your hospitality.&nbsp;<br><br>MODERATOR:&nbsp; (As interpreted.)&nbsp; Thank you very much.&nbsp; We will now accept questions from the press.&nbsp; First, Japanese journalists, to be followed by U.S. journalists.&nbsp; That will be the order of the questions.&nbsp;<br><br>Those of you who have questions, please raise your hand.&nbsp; For Japanese journalists, I will appoint the journalist, and U.S. journalists will be appointed by President Biden.&nbsp;<br><br>Please come to the closest microphone, identify yourself and your affiliation, and please be brief and clear in your questions.&nbsp;<br><br>Due to infection prevention, please keep your facial masks when you deliver your question.&nbsp;<br><br>Now, Japanese journalists, are there any questions?&nbsp;&nbsp;The front row, Yamamoto-san?<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (As interpreted.)&nbsp; TV Asahi.&nbsp; My name is Yamamoto.&nbsp; Prime Minister, President Biden, thank you very much.&nbsp;<br><br>First, to Prime Minister:&nbsp;With the Russian aggression of Ukraine, Prime Minister, you&#8217;ve been saying that security of Europe and security of the Indo-Pacific are inseparable.&nbsp;&nbsp;In today&#8217;s meeting, did you talk about response to China?&nbsp;&nbsp;How did you analyze the current status of the Cross-Straits relations?&nbsp;&nbsp;Did the Japanese side or U.S. side explain how U.S. would respond in times of contingency?&nbsp;&nbsp;What was the request from the U.S. side regarding Japanese response to a contingency in Cross-Straits situation?&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you explain the defense budget increase or enemy base strike capability?&nbsp;&nbsp;What did you explain in that context, Prime Minister?<br><br>PRIME MINISTER KISHIDA:&nbsp; (As interpreted.)&nbsp; Well, thank you for your question.&nbsp; First of all, at today&#8217;s summit meeting, as regard Taiwan Strait issue that you asked, we confirmed that basic stances of two countries on Taiwan remains to be unchanged, and underscored the importance of peace and stability of Taiwan Strait, which is an indispensable element for security and prosperity of international community, and called upon peaceful resolution of Cross-Strait issues.<br><br>In the region, security-related environment is getting severer.&nbsp; Unilateral attempt to change the status quo by force, like Russia&#8217;s aggression against Ukraine this time, should never be tolerated in Indo-Pacific.&nbsp; Above all, in East Asia, it’s indispensable to further strengthen Japan-U.S. alliance.<br><br>Based on this shared awareness, I have said that &#8212; fundamentally reinforce Japan&#8217;s defense capability.&nbsp; And I stated my determination to fundamentally reinforce Japan&#8217;s defense capabilities and secure substantial increase of its defense budget needed to effect it.&nbsp; And President Biden strongly supported my determination.<br><br>And also from myself, I have said that includes what is called “enemy base strike capability.”&nbsp; All the options will be there, not to exclude any one of them.&nbsp; And this is what I said to President in Indo-Pacific region, as well as to ensure the peace and prosperity of the international community, the basis is the cornerstone of which is Japan-U.S. alliance.&nbsp; And toward the further strengthening of the alliance, we would like to remain in close coordination between Japan and the United States.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Mr. President.&nbsp; I have a question for Prime Minister Kishida as well.&nbsp; But, Mr. President, I wanted to ask you about the economy.&nbsp; During your trip here to Asia, you&#8217;ve promoted the investments by Samsung and Hyundai.&nbsp; But back home in the United States, Americans are dealing with record-high inflation.&nbsp; The Fed has raised interest rates to try to address those issues.&nbsp; And there are also just enormously high gas prices.<br><br>Given the cross-currents of the economy right now &#8212; the war in Ukraine, the China lockdowns that we&#8217;ve seen &#8212; should Americans be prepared for a recession?&nbsp; In your view, is a recession in the United States inevitable?<br><br>PRESIDENT BIDEN:&nbsp; No.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why not?<br><br>PRESIDENT BIDEN:&nbsp; Look, you&#8217;re talking about the significant progress we&#8217;ve made in making sure we don&#8217;t have supply chain backups &#8212; about the 8,000 jobs that Hyundai is going to be bringing to Georgia; 3,000 jobs to Texas from Samsung, $17 billion investment; Toyota, 1,700 jobs in North Carolina on battery technology; the situation where we &#8212; at &#8212; we&#8217;ve created over 8 million new jobs, where unemployment is down to 3.6 percent, and so on and so forth &#8212; as if they&#8217;re a problem.&nbsp; Imagine where we’d be with Putin&#8217;s tax and the war in Ukraine had we not made that enormous progress.<br><br>Our GDP is going to grow faster than China&#8217;s for the first time in 40 years.&nbsp; Now, does that mean we don&#8217;t have problems?&nbsp; We do.&nbsp; We have problems that the rest of the world has, but less consequential than the rest of the world has because of our internal growth and strength.<br><br>Here&#8217;s the situation.&nbsp; And when it comes to the gas prices, we&#8217;re going through an incredible transition that is taking place that, God willing, when it&#8217;s over, we&#8217;ll be stronger and the world will be stronger and less reliant on fossil fuels when this is over.<br><br>You see what Europe is doing relative to the importation of Russian gas.&nbsp; You see what &#8212; anyway, I won&#8217;t go through it all, but &#8212;<br><br>And what I&#8217;ve been able to do to keep it from getting even worse &#8212; and it&#8217;s bad.&nbsp; The price of gas at the pump is something that I told you &#8212; you heard me say before &#8212; it would be a matter of great discussion at my kitchen table when I was a kid growing up.&nbsp; It&#8217;s affecting a lot of families.<br><br>But we have released over two hundred and, I think, fifty-seven thousand &#8212; million barrels of oil, I should say.&nbsp; Us and the rest of the world we convinced to get involved.&nbsp; It&#8217;s helped, but it&#8217;s not been enough.<br><br>We also find ourselves in a situation where we have food shortages &#8212; food shortages because of Ukraine.&nbsp; There are over &#8212; there are literally millions of bushels of oil &#8212; I mean, excuse me, of grain being held up in Ukraine that would fundamentally impact positively on the market in terms of bringing down food prices across the board.<br><br>So we&#8217;re finding ourselves in a position where we&#8217;re working very hard with American farmers and American manufacturing- &#8212; and American agricultural products to provide more fertilizer and a whole range of things.<br><br>This is going to be a haul.&nbsp; This is going to take some time.&nbsp; But in the meantime, it seems to me the best thing I can do &#8212; in addition to try to get the Middle Eastern countries, including OPEC, to raise their production of oil and move along that route &#8212; is to see to it that we continue to grow our economy, create jobs.<br><br>And the other thing is: There&#8217;s a second wave &#8212; I know you don&#8217;t want to talk about it &#8212; not necessarily you; people don&#8217;t want to talk about it right now.&nbsp; And I won&#8217;t take up the time.&nbsp; But there&#8217;s a second wave to impact on inflation, in terms of people&#8217;s daily cost.&nbsp;<br><br>If you&#8217;re able to have childcare at 17 percent of &#8212; 7 percent of your income, if you&#8217;re able to be in a position where we were able to provide for a tax cut for middle-class people and working-class people, et cetera &#8212; all those things would be very helpful. &nbsp;<br><br>And we &#8212; but when we have a 50-50 Senate, it means we have 50 presidents.&nbsp; And I&#8217;m having a little trouble getting some of these things passed.&nbsp; But we&#8217;re not going to give up.&nbsp; We&#8217;re going to keep pushing.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I just follow you on one point?&nbsp; Secretary Yellen said recently that some of the tariffs on Chinese imports impose more harm on consumers and businesses, and aren&#8217;t very strategic.&nbsp; Do you share that view?&nbsp; And are you considering taking down some of those tariffs?<br><br>PRESIDENT BIDEN:&nbsp; I&#8217;m talking with the Secretary when we get home.&nbsp; I am considering it.&nbsp; We did not impose any of those tariffs.&nbsp; They were imposed by the last administration, and they&#8217;re under consideration.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>PRESIDENT BIDEN:&nbsp; Thank you.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prime Minister Kishida, if I may, sir: We&#8217;re going to be hearing more about this Indo-Pacific Economic Forum today.&nbsp; What message do you hope that it sends to China in the global market?&nbsp; And do you see this as a potential precursor to some type of trade pact, given the &#8212; the political situation in the United States dealing with TPP?<br><br>PRIME MINISTER KISHIDA:&nbsp;&nbsp;(As interpreted.)&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, thank you for the IPEF &#8212; your question.&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, United States in the Indo-Pacific region is making economic interest known and highly interested, and the very posture shown by the United States is something we highly value in Japan.<br><br>Regarding the TPP, we are truly hoping for return of the United States.&nbsp; But even with the TPP, it&#8217;s important that we proceed with discussions on IPEF.&nbsp; And that attitude of the United States is wholeheartedly welcomed by the Japanese government, and we would like to support the U.S. initiative.</p>



<p>China right now in the Indo-Pacific region is demonstrating significant economic presence.&nbsp; That&#8217;s true, but look into the substance of their presence.&nbsp; Are they abiding by international rules?&nbsp; What about development finance?&nbsp; Are they carrying about sustainable initiatives?&nbsp; They have to do that because they are a major power.&nbsp; They have significant responsibility.&nbsp; Even in the economic field, they have to live up to that responsibility.<br><br>So Japan will cooperate with the United States &#8212; and, vis-à-vis China, persuade them to live up to their responsibilities to abide by international rules.&nbsp; And we think that such attitude is very important.<br><br>Thank you.</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; (As interpreted.)&nbsp; So, once again, we will receive question from a Japanese reporter.&nbsp; Please raise your hand.<br><br>Asahi (inaudible).<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (As interpreted.)&nbsp; Ikejiri from Asahi Newspaper.&nbsp; Prime Minister Kishida, President Biden, nice to meet you.&nbsp; I have a question once again about IPEF.</p>



<p>It is said that IPEF is different from the framework of TPP, and some other members are saying that there is less merit there, benefit.&nbsp; Would the IPEF will be effective a framework?&nbsp; Or in order to ensure the effectiveness for IPEF, what is the role that Japan will be playing, Prime Minister Kishida?</p>



<p>And also, there was expectations expressed for United States to come back to TPP.&nbsp; What was the response you received?<br><br>PRIME MINISTER KISHIDA:&nbsp; (As interpreted.)&nbsp; First of all, on IPEF, under the leadership of President Biden, shortly after this press conference, there will be official launch of IPEF.&nbsp; That&#8217;s the plan.&nbsp; Such ceremony is slated to take place.</p>



<p>I said this before, but this is a demonstration of the positive commitment of the United States to the Indo-Pacific.&nbsp; Japan welcomes such steps, and we are in full support.&nbsp; And I&#8217;m going to join President Biden to participate in the inauguration ceremony.</p>



<p>And through IPEF, it&#8217;s important to realize sustainable and inclusive economic growth in the Indo-Pacific.<br><br>In your question, you asked about the concern of some countries who may think that there is very little merit or advantage to them, but we&#8217;re going to discuss various matters, not only with the United States, but regional partners, including the ASEAN countries, in order to jointly deliver concrete results.</p>



<p>So this is a venue to engage in positive discussion for cooperation.&nbsp; And through such initiatives, we want to deliver concrete and specific results.&nbsp; And that will serve as specific and actual advantage or merit for those countries.</p>



<p>You asked the question on TPP.&nbsp; From the strategic perspective of U.S. engagement in the international order of the Indo-Pacific, we want United States to be engaged from the economic perspective as well, so our position remains unchanged.&nbsp; We think it&#8217;s desirable for the United States to return to the TPP.<br><br>So, Japan hopes to see Japa- &#8212; to see U.S. come back to the TPP.&nbsp; And during the meeting, I directly communicated our hopes as such to the President.<br><br>I will not make any further detailed comments since it pertains to diplomatic exchanges.<br>Finally, I invite questions from the U.S. press.<br>PRESIDENT BIDEN:&nbsp; Nancy Cordes, with NBC &#8212; CBS.&nbsp; Hey, Nance.<br><br>(Reporter approaches microphone.)<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sorry.<br><br>PRESIDENT BIDEN:&nbsp; Dangerous.&nbsp; (Laughs.)<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tight quarters.<br><br>Thank you so much.&nbsp; I have a question for the Prime Minister, but first to you, Mr. President: We&#8217;re already dealing with one global pandemic, and you said yesterday that monkeypox is something that everyone should be concerned about.&nbsp; There are a few confirmed cases in the U.S., and some countries are imposing 21-day quarantines for people who are infected or even, in some cases, just exposed.&nbsp; Should Americans expect something similar?<br><br>PRESIDENT BIDEN:&nbsp; No, I don&#8217;t think so.&nbsp; Look, we&#8217;ve had this monkeypox in the larger numbers in the past, number one.&nbsp;<br><br>Number two, we have vaccines to care for it &#8212; to take care of it.&nbsp;<br><br>Number three, there is &#8212; thus far, there doesn&#8217;t seem to be a need for any kind of extra &#8212; extra efforts beyond what&#8217;s going on.&nbsp; And so, I just don&#8217;t think it rises to the level of the kind of concern that existed with COVID-19 or &#8212; and the smallpox vaccine works for it.&nbsp; So &#8212; but I think people should be careful.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you think that the U.S. has enough smallpox vaccine stockpiled?<br><br>PRESIDENT BIDEN:&nbsp; I think we do have enough to deal with the likelihood of the problem.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, Mr. Prime Minister, can you tell us how Japan would respond if China were to invade or tried to take over Taiwan?&nbsp; And how do you hope that the U.S. would respond if that were to happen?<br><br>And, Mr. President, if you could tell us how the U.S. is prepared to respond, we would appreciate it.&nbsp;<br><br>PRIME MINISTER KISHIDA:&nbsp; (As interpreted.)&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; On Taiwan: In the summit meeting, it was brought up in our discussions &#8212; the situation in the Taiwan Straits.&nbsp;<br><br>The fundamental position of Japan and the United States was reaffirmed; there is no change.&nbsp; And we asserted the importance of peace and stability of the Taiwan Straits, which is fundamental to international order, and peaceful resolution of the Straits issue should be pursued.&nbsp; We reconfirmed that position.&nbsp;<br><br>Now, in Asia, we are against any unilateral attempt to change status quo by force in Asia, all the more so because of such position regarding the situation in Ukraine.&nbsp; We think that unilateral attempt to change status quo is impermissible.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re cooperating with the international cooperation and we decided to participate in the strong sanctions, and we are providing humanitarian assistance.&nbsp;<br><br>And in Asia as well, peace and stability must be upheld and defended.&nbsp; And in order to defend peace and stability in Asia, we will drastically upgrade and strengthen our defense capability, and United States is the only ally for Japan.&nbsp; And Japan-U.S. alliance is thus very, very important.&nbsp; We have to strengthen this alliance to defend peace and stability of the region.&nbsp; That&#8217;s our belief.&nbsp;<br><br>And in so doing, extended deterrence and response by the United States must be reliable.&nbsp; We have full confidence in response by the United States, including extended deterrence.&nbsp; And strengthening of Japan-U.S. alliance is very important.&nbsp;<br><br>And we truly hope that as many members of the general public will have even deeper confidence on this alliance so that that in turn will lead to regional peace and stability.&nbsp; And I look forward to cooperating with President Biden to that end.<br><br>PRESIDENT BIDEN:&nbsp; Our policy toward Taiwan has not &#8212; Taiwan &#8212; has not changed at all.&nbsp; We remain committed to supporting the peace and stability across the Taiwan Straits and ensuring that there is no unilateral change to the status quo.&nbsp;<br><br>I would add that one of the reasons why it&#8217;s so important that Putin pay a dear price for his barbarism in Ukraine: The idea that on your station today and every other station in America they’re showing bombings of every school &#8212; no &#8212; no military purpose &#8212; schools, hospitals, daycare centers, all the things, museums &#8212; blowing up all the museums.&nbsp; I believe what Putin is attempting to do is eliminate the identity of Ukraine &#8212; the identity.&nbsp; He can&#8217;t occupy it, but he can try to destroy its identity.&nbsp;<br><br>And the reason I bother to mention that is: He has to pay and Russia has to pay a long-term price for that, in terms of the sanctions that have been imposed.&nbsp;<br><br>And the reason I bother to say this &#8212; it’s not just about Ukraine: If, in fact, after all he&#8217;s done there&#8217;s a rapprochement met between China &#8212; I mean, excuse me, between the Ukrainians and &#8212; and Russia, and these sanctions are not continued to be sustained in many ways, then what signal does that send to China about the cost of attempting &#8212; attempting to take Taiwan by force?&nbsp; They&#8217;re already flirting with danger right now by flying so close and all the maneuvers they’ve undertaken.&nbsp;<br><br>But the United States is committed.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve made a commitment.&nbsp; We support the One China policy.&nbsp; We support all &#8212; all that we&#8217;ve done in the past, but that does not mean &#8212; it does not mean that China has the ability &#8212; has the &#8212; excuse me, the jurisdiction to go in and use force to take over Taiwan.&nbsp;<br><br>So we stand firmly with Japan and with other nations that &#8212; not to let that happen.&nbsp; And my expectation is it will not happen; it will not be attempted.&nbsp;<br><br>And my expectation is &#8212; a lot of it depends upon just how strongly the world makes clear that that kind of action is going to result in long-term disapprobation by the rest of the community.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Very quickly: You didn&#8217;t want to get involved in the Ukraine conflict militarily for obvious reasons.&nbsp; Are you willing to get involved militarily to defend Taiwan, if it comes to that?<br><br>PRESIDENT BIDEN:&nbsp; Yes.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You are?<br><br>PRESIDENT BIDEN:&nbsp; That&#8217;s the commitment we made.&nbsp; That’s the commitment we made.&nbsp; We are not &#8212;<br><br>Look, here&#8217;s the situation: We agree with the One China policy; we’ve signed on to it and all the attendant agreements made from there.&nbsp; But the idea that &#8212; that it can be taken by force &#8212; just taken by force &#8212; is just not a &#8212; is just not appropriate.&nbsp; It will dislocate the entire region and be another action similar to what happened in &#8212; in Ukraine.&nbsp; And so, it&#8217;s a burden that is even stronger.&nbsp;<br><br>Thank you very much.&nbsp; Appreciate it.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>MODERATOR:&nbsp; (As interpreted.)&nbsp; Thank you very much.&nbsp; This will be the end of the joint press conference by Prime Minister Kishida and President Biden.&nbsp; Thank you very much for your cooperation.&nbsp;<br><br>2:58 P.M. JST</p>
