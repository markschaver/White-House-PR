<p>Last night at my direction, U.S. military forces in the northwest Syria successfully undertook a counterterrorism operation to protect the American people and our Allies make the world a safer place. Thanks to the skill and bravery of our Armed Forces, we have taken off the battlefield Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi—the leader of ISIS. All Americans have returned safely from the operation. I will have more to say in an address to the American people later this morning. May God protect our troops.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"> </p>



<p>Today, the Biden Administration is announcing additional actions to reduce gun crime and make communities safer. This plan builds on the steps the President has taken since the beginning of his Administration to stop the flow of guns being used in crimes, bolster federal, state, and local law enforcement, invest in community-based programs that prevent, interrupt, and reduce violence, expand opportunity, lower recidivism, and increase funding for community policing.<br><br>The President is committed to serving as a strong partner for communities on the frontlines of the fight against crime. That’s why his American Rescue Plan gives cities and states historic levels of funding that they can use to put more cops on the beat, and invest in community-based violence prevention and intervention programs.<br><br>President Biden also recognizes the important role that federal law enforcement plays in supporting their local partners – especially in stopping the interstate flow of guns used in crimes, like the gun that was used in the tragic recent fatal shooting of two NYPD officers. The Department of Justice has launched five gun trafficking strike forces, including one in New York City, and it has implemented a nationwide <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-merrick-b-garland-announces-new-effort-reduce-violent-crime">strategy to combat violent crime</a>, which has focused over the past year in taking violent criminals and thousands of crime guns off the streets.<br><br>Stronger law enforcement is critical in stopping gun crime, but it’s made more effective when we make real investments in making our communities stronger and in addressing the causes of crime before it spills over into violence. That’s why President Biden’s comprehensive approach makes sure cities and states have the funding, training, and know-how they need to invest in proven tactics including community policing, street outreach by credible messengers, hospital-based intervention, and youth programming. And it’s bolstered by additional funding to create economic opportunity with job training, expand after-school activities, and provide stable housing and other stabilizing supports necessary to reduce recidivism and help formerly incarcerated individuals reenter their communities. That’s also why the President continues to urge Congress to act on his $300 million budget request to more than double the size of the Department of Justice’s COPS community policing grant program.<br><br>Taken together, this strategy steps up and focuses law enforcement efforts on violent offenders, stems the trafficking of illegal guns, and makes real investments in communities to intervene in and prevent gun violence. The President knows a complex and devastating challenge like the surge of gun crime we’ve seen over the last two years requires an ambitious, evidence-based response that uses every tool at our disposal, and that’s exactly what his plan does.<br><br><strong>The President’s Comprehensive Strategy to Reduce Gun Crime</strong><br><br>Last June, President Biden announced a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/23/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-comprehensive-strategy-to-prevent-and-respond-to-gun-crime-and-ensure-public-safety/">five-part, comprehensive strategy</a> to tackle the persistent spike in gun crime cities across the country have experienced since the start of the pandemic. The President’s strategy:</p>



<ul><li>Stems the flow of firearms used to commit violence,</li><li>Supports local law enforcement with federal tools and resources to address violent crime,</li><li>Invests in evidence-based community violence interventions,</li><li>Expands summer programming, employment opportunities, and other services and supports for teenagers and young adults, and</li><li>Helps formerly incarcerated individuals successfully reenter their communities.</li></ul>



<p><strong>New Actions to Implement the President’s Comprehensive Strategy</strong><br><br><em>Surging Efforts to Enforce Our Gun Laws and Keep Guns out of Dangerous Hands</em><br><br>Today, the U.S. Department of Justice announced a set of important new actions to stem the flow of firearms used to commit violence and support local law enforcement partners in efforts to combat gun crime. The Justice Department will:</p>



<ul><li>Prioritize combating violent crime by directing every U.S. Attorney’s Office nationwide to increase resources dedicated to district-specific violent crime strategies. The Justice Department will work with state and local law enforcement to address the most significant drivers of violence in each district, including to get repeat gun violence offenders off of our streets. &nbsp;New&nbsp;York City’s Gun Violence Strategic Partnership – which the President and Attorney General will visit today with Mayor Eric Adams – is one model of the strategies Justice will help expand nationwide.</li><li>Crack down on the “Iron Pipeline” – the illegal flow of guns sold in the south, transported up the East Coast, and found at crime scenes in cities from Baltimore to New York City – and other firearms trafficking by adding personnel and other resources to strengthen the Justice Department’s multijurisdictional task forces that target interstate firearms trafficking.</li><li>Launch a National Ghost Gun Enforcement Initiative, which will train a national cadre of prosecutors and disseminate investigation and prosecution tools to help bring cases against those who use ghost guns to commit crimes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Pursue unlawful gun sellers that put firearms in the wrong hands by taking steps such as prioritizing federal prosecutions of those who criminally sell or transfer firearms that are used in violent crimes, including unlicensed dealers who sell guns to criminals without the required background checks.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Read more about the Justice Department’s new actions <a href="https://www.justice.gov/file/1468221/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.<br><br><em>Providing States and Cities with the Resources They Need to Reduce Gun Crime</em><br><br>Today, the President is reaffirming his call for Congress to reach a bipartisan agreement on FY22 appropriations that include half a billion dollars in new funding for proven strategies we know will reduce gun crime: a $300 million increase to expand accountable community policing through the COPS Hiring Program and $200 million for evidence-based community violence interventions. Facing a spike in gun crime that has persisted since the start of the pandemic, cities across the country cannot wait any longer for Congress to provide the resources the President requested as part of his FY22 Budget to save lives.<br><br><strong>Building on Progress: One Year of Action to Reduce Gun Violence</strong><br><br>Below are a few highlights of the Administration’s work to implement the President’s comprehensive gun crime reduction strategy over the past seven months. You can read a full wrap-up of the Administration’s first year of gun violence prevention work <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/ope/briefing-room/2021/12/14/2021-efforts-to-reduce-gun-violence/">here</a>.<br><br>1. Stemming the flow of firearms used to commit violence. In June 2021, the Justice Department announced a new policy to underscore zero tolerance for certain willful violations of the law by federally licensed firearms dealers that put public safety at risk. In July, the Justice Department launched five new law enforcement strike forces focused on addressing significant firearms trafficking corridors that have diverted guns to New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, the Bay Area, and Washington, D.C. Those strike forces have already opened more than 540 investigations and taken custody of almost 3,100 crime guns. Last year, the Justice Department’s Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) issued a proposed rule to help curb the proliferation of “ghost guns,” which are unserialized, privately made firearms that are increasingly being recovered at crime scenes and have been identified by law enforcement officials as a serious threat to public safety.&nbsp;&nbsp;ATF is analyzing public comments in response to the proposed rule, the next step in the regulatory process.<br><br>2. Supporting local law enforcement with federal tools and resources to address violent crime. The Biden Administration made historic levels of funding from the American Rescue Plan – $350 billion in state and local funding – available for law enforcement purposes such as hiring more officers, investing in retention strategies, and paying overtime to advancing community policing strategies in communities experiencing an increase in gun violence associated with the pandemic. Funds were also made available for prosecuting gun traffickers, rogue dealers, and other parties contributing to the supply of crime guns, as well as collaborative federal/state/local efforts to identify and address gun trafficking channels. Cities across the country, such as Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Albuquerque, New Mexico; Syracuse, New York; and Mobile, Alabama, have responded to this call by committing and deploying ARP funds to community-oriented policing and other law enforcement strategies. In addition, as part of the Justice Department’s <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-merrick-b-garland-announces-new-effort-reduce-violent-crime">Comprehensive Strategy for Reducing Violent Crime</a>, the Justice Department has supported law enforcement in local communities in addressing gun violence. In particular, the Justice Department has provided enforcement support from the ATF, Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI), Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), and United States Marshals Service (USMS).&nbsp;<br><br>3. Investing in evidence-based community violence interventions. As part of his Build Back Better agenda, President Biden proposed $5 billion in funding for the Department of Justice and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to invest in community violence interventions – evidence-based programs that are shown to help reduce violent crime.&nbsp;While working to secure this funding, the Biden Administration is using existing resources to expand community violence interventions. For example, the Biden Administration made certain American Rescue Plan (ARP) funding – $350 billion in state and local funding, and $122 billion in K-12 funding – available as unprecedented resources for CVI. Senior White House advisors also issued a <a href="http://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/2021/images/07/12/071221.crime.memo.pdf">memo</a> to state and local officials outlining how these elected leaders not only can – but should – use ARP funds for CVI. Cities across the country, such as Seattle, Washington; Buffalo, New York; and Atlanta, Georgia – have responded to this call by committing and deploying ARP funds for CVI. In addition, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/07/fact-sheet-more-details-on-the-biden-harris-administrations-investments-in-community-violence-interventions/">five federal agencies made changes to 26 different programs</a> to direct vital support to community violence intervention programs as quickly as possible. In July, senior White House staff <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/16/readout-of-first-meeting-of-white-house-community-violence-intervention-collaborative/">established</a> The White House Community Violence Intervention Collaborative, a 16-jurisdiction cohort of mayors, law enforcement, CVI experts, and philanthropic leaders committed to using American Rescue Plan funding or other public funding to increase investment in their community violence intervention infrastructure. The Collaborative is spending 18 months strengthening and scaling the jurisdictions’ community violence intervention infrastructure to reduce gun crime and promote public safety. National experts and federal agencies are providing training and technical assistance to help communities assess their existing public safety ecosystem, identify gaps, and build the capacity to expand programming that saves lives.&nbsp;<br><br>4. Expanding summer programming, employment opportunities, and other services and supports for teenagers and young adults. The Biden Administration has made historic levels of funding from the American Rescue Plan&nbsp; – $350 billion in state and local funding and $122 billion in school funding&nbsp; – available for purposes such as hiring nurses, counselors, and social workers; providing court personnel and operations costs to return to pre-pandemic operation levels; providing and expanding employment services, including summer jobs for young people and programs that provide training and work experience for formerly incarcerated persons and other individuals who live in communities most impacted by high levels of violence; providing and expanding summer education and enrichment programs, including summer camp; and scaling up wraparound services, such as housing, medical and mental health care, trauma-informed care, substance use disorder treatment, food assistance, and job placement services, for victims of crime, young people, formerly incarcerated persons, and individuals and households facing economic insecurity due to the pandemic. Cities and counties across the country, including St. Louis, Missouri; Tucson, Arizona; and Los Angeles County, California, have responded to this call by committing and deploying ARP funds for these purposes.<br><br>5. Helping formerly incarcerated individuals successfully reenter their communities. On June 21 the Department of Labor awarded $85.5 million to help formerly incarcerated adults and young people in 28 communities transition out of the criminal justice system and connect with quality jobs. This included $60 million for Pathway Home projects serving adults, including beginning while participants are still incarcerated and continuing post-release, as well as $25.5 million in Young Adult Reentry Partnership grants to organizations serving young adults 18-24 who were previously involved with the justice system or who left high school before graduation. The President’s FY22 budget proposal calls for an increase in these grants, to $150 million, for reentry employment opportunities. The Treasury and Labor Departments has provided training and technical assistance to employers to help leverage multiple federal resources, including the <a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/wotc">Work Opportunity Tax Credit</a> (WOTC) and the <a href="https://bonds4jobs.com/">federal bonding program</a> to encourage employment of formerly incarcerated persons. In FY21, the Department of Justice’s Office of Justice Programs (OJP)&nbsp;provided more than $110 million in grant awards to support adults and youth returning to their communities after confinement. The President’s FY22 budget proposal calls for a $25 million increase for Second Chance Act programs, to further invest in diversion and substance abuse treatment programs, enhance reentry and rehabilitation efforts, and connect people with mental health services.<br><br>In addition, the President’s House-passed Build Back Better Act includes $1.5 billion for grants to help formerly incarcerated individuals secure good jobs and successfully reenter their communities. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will create hundreds of thousands of good-paying jobs that formerly incarcerated individuals will be able to access. Lastly, in his <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/06/25/executive-order-on-diversity-equity-inclusion-and-accessibility-in-the-federal-workforce/">Executive Order on Advancing Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility</a> President Biden directed the Office of Personnel Management to evaluate barriers to federal employment for formerly incarcerated persons and actions to reduce these barriers, including educating and partnering with agencies to leverage hiring authorities to bring formerly incarcerated individuals into federal government.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Via Teleconference</p>



<p>3:08 P.M. EST</p>



<p>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us.&nbsp;Today, Dr. Walensky will provide an update on Omicron, Dr. Fauci will present the latest science, and Dr. Murthy will discuss Pfizer’s vaccine application for kids under the age of five.&nbsp; And then I’ll cover operational planning so that we’re ready for that age group.&nbsp;<br><br>With that, over to Dr. Walensky.&nbsp; Dr. Walensky?<br><br>DR. WALENSKY:&nbsp; Thank you, Jeff.&nbsp; Good afternoon.&nbsp; I&#8217;d like to start by walking you through today’s data.&nbsp;<br><br>The current seven-day daily average of cases is about 446,400 cases per day, a decrease of about 36 percent over the previous week.<br><br>The seven-day average of hospital admissions is about 17,100 per day, also a decrease of about 14 percent over the previous week.&nbsp;<br><br>And the seven-day average daily deaths are about 2,300 per day, which is an increase of about 4 percent over the prior week.<br><br>While we continue to see large decreases in average daily case counts across the country, hospitalizations remain high, stretching our healthcare capacity and workforce to its limits in some areas of the country.&nbsp; And daily deaths also remain quite high.&nbsp;<br><br>And with the mixed news above, similar to other waves during the pandemic, our data continue to reinforce the critical importance of vaccination.<br><br>Last week, I shared data from our surveillance studies demonstrating the effectiveness of vaccination, including boosters, on decreasing cases, emergency department visits, and hospitalizations.&nbsp;<br><br>Additional new data continue to support these findings.&nbsp; On this slide, you can see data from 25 U.S. jurisdictions that report cases and deaths linked to vaccination status.&nbsp;<br><br>Similar to what I showed you last week, vaccination and booster doses substantially decrease the risk of death from COVID-19.&nbsp; Looking at the data from the week ending December 4th, the number of average weekly deaths for those who are unvaccinated was 9.7 per 100,000 people, but only 0.7 per 100,000 people for those who were vaccinated.&nbsp;<br><br>This means the risk of dying from COVID-19 was 14 times higher for people who were unvaccinated compared to those who received only a primary series.&nbsp;<br><br>For those who were boosted, the average of weekly deaths was 0.1 per 100,000 people, meaning that unvaccinated individuals were 97 times more likely to die compared to those who were boosted.&nbsp;<br><br>I also want to share new data from CDC’s COVID-NET hospital surveillance network to further show how essential vaccination and boosting is in preventing hospitalization from COVID-19.<br><br>On this slide, you can see data comparing the percentage of people age 65 and older who are unvaccinated and boosted in the general population &#8212; in blue &#8212; and those who are hospitalized &#8212; in green.&nbsp;<br><br>As shown on the slide, only 12 percent of those age 65 and over remain unvaccinated in the general population.&nbsp; But when we look at those over the age of 65 who are in the hospital for COVID-19, 54 percent are unvaccinated.&nbsp;<br><br>In stark contrast, now let&#8217;s look at those who have been boosted &#8212; on the bottom.&nbsp; Here, 57 percent of those over age 65 are boosted in the general population.&nbsp; And only 8 percent of those over the age of 65 and in the hospital for COVID-19 have received a booster dose.&nbsp;<br><br>These same trends are seen across all age groups.&nbsp; These data show us that the percent of people who are currently hospitalized due to COVID-19 are disproportionately unvaccinated and disproportionately not boosted.<br><br>Additionally, these data confirm that vaccination and boosting continue to protect against severe illness and hospitalization, even during the Omicron surge.<br><br>If you are not up to date on your COVID-19 vaccinations, you have not optimized your protection against severe disease and death, and you should get vaccinated and boosted if you are eligible.&nbsp;<br><br>Thank you.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll now turn it over to Dr. Fauci.<br><br>DR. FAUCI:&nbsp; Thank you very much, Dr. Walensky.&nbsp;<br><br>What I&#8217;d like to do over the next couple of minutes is to address a common misperception and the result of misinformation, and that is whether vaccination negatively impacts people trying to conceive &#8212; namely does it have a negative impact on fertility.&nbsp;<br><br>The data are clear.&nbsp;<br><br>Next slide.<br><br>I will show a couple of representative studies.&nbsp; This published just a week and a half ago in the American Journal of Epidemiology, which is a prospective cohort study of vaccination and SARS infection and fertility.&nbsp;<br><br>The study is an NIH-funded pregnancy study online &#8212; or “PRESTO” for short &#8212; of couples who are trying to conceive through intercourse.&nbsp; It enrolled participants before pregnancy and collected data on vaccination and other variables during the pre-conception period, and then collected data on subsequent fertility.&nbsp;<br><br>There were over 2,000 females between the ages of 21 and 45 in the U.S. or Canada.&nbsp; They were enrolled between December 2020 and September 2021, and they were followed through November 2021.<br><br>Next slide.<br><br>But data are clear: COVID-19 vaccination in male or female partners did not affect the likelihood of conception.&nbsp; Couples were 18 percent less likely to conceive if the male partner had been infected with SARS-CoV-2 within 60 days before a menstrual cycle.&nbsp; That is “infected,” not “vaccinated.”<br><br>However, the COVID-19 disease only temporarily reduced male fertility.&nbsp;<br><br>Next slide.<br><br>In another study &#8212; published, again, about a week and a half ago &#8212; this was in an in vitro fertilization clinic.&nbsp; And the question that was asked: that with people vaccinated, in this case, either with the Pfizer or the Moderna product had similar responses to ovarian stimulation, which is used to stimulate the ovary in preparation for in vitro fertilization.&nbsp; And similar pregnancy outcomes compared with unvaccinated people.<br><br>The reproductive potential does not appear to be affected by vaccination in people who undergo in vitro fertilization.<br><br>Next slide.<br><br>So, what&#8217;s our takeaway message about vaccination and conception?&nbsp; New data add to previous studies that indicate that COVID-19 vaccination does not negatively impact fertility.<br><br>CDC and professional medical organizations serving people of reproductive age emphasize, as shown on this website, that there&#8217;s no evidence that vaccination impairs fertility.&nbsp;<br><br>And, of course, as we&#8217;ve all said over and over again, vaccination is recommended for people who are trying to get pregnant now or might become pregnant in the future, as well as their partners.&nbsp; And anyone who&#8217;s vaccinated and pregnant, breastfeeding, trying to get pregnant now or might become pregnant in the future should also get a booster shot when eligible.<br><br>Final slide.<br><br>The message is the same: Get vaccinated and get boosted for so many reasons.&nbsp;<br><br>Now over to you, Dr. Murthy.<br><br>SURGEON GENERAL MURTHY:&nbsp; Well, thank you so much, Dr. Fauci.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s good to be with everyone again today.&nbsp;<br><br>As many of you know, the FDA has now received Pfizer&#8217;s application for a vaccine for children age six months through four years.&nbsp;<br><br>Now, Jeff is going to talk more about how we&#8217;re preparing for the possibility of this milestone, but first I want to walk you through the process.<br><br>Pfizer&#8217;s application will now undergo the same independent, rigorous, and transparent review process that was used to authorize the vaccines that now more than 250 million Americans have received, including millions of children ages five and up.<br><br>It will involve the FDA receiving the full data from Pfizer, posting that data publicly, and then convening its advisory committee for a transparent discussion of the data.<br><br>The FDA will then render its opinion, after which the CDC and its advisory group will assess the data and make their recommendation.&nbsp; This is the same rigorous process that was used to assess numerous vaccines long before the pandemic began.<br><br>I know how eager parents and caregivers are for the good news on this front.&nbsp; For much of this pandemic, millions of parents have carried with them an added layer of worry knowing that their children under five didn&#8217;t have protection from COVID the way older vaccinated children do.<br><br>I felt this worry too as a father of a four-year-old daughter who is not yet eligible to get vaccinated.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m hopeful that we may be one step closer to having an added layer of protection for our younger children, and one less worry for their parents.<br><br>A vaccine for children under five would mean we would have vaccines available for essentially all age groups in America.&nbsp; This would be a major milestone.<br><br>Now there are a number of steps ahead to determine if the vaccine is both safe and effective for our kids under five.&nbsp; And please know that the FDA will not cut any corners in their review process.&nbsp; They know that they are the gold standard that all of us rely on.<br><br>If and when the FDA and CDC decide to move forward, we will work closely with our trusted community partners to ensure that families have accurate science-based information about the vaccine so they can make the best decisions for their children.<br><br>And as we await this review process, I want to emphasize once more just how important it is that the rest of us get vaccinated and get our kids five and older, who are already eligible, vaccinated as well.&nbsp; If you are 12 and up and you&#8217;re vaccinated, please get boosted as soon as you&#8217;re eligible.&nbsp;<br><br>And all of us should wear high-quality masks when in public indoor settings. &nbsp;This is how we can continue to create a wall of protection around our children under five as we look to safeguard their health.<br><br>Thanks so much for your time today.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll pass it to Jeff.<br><br>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Well, thanks, Doctors.&nbsp; If the FDA authorizes and CDC recommends this vaccine, 18 million children under the age of five will become eligible for protection from COVID-19.<br><br>Before we open up for questions, I want to share how we&#8217;re preparing now, just as we did with vaccines, for kids ages 5 to 11 so that we are ready and we hit the ground running following decisions from FDA and CDC.<br><br>Importantly, this vaccine is specifically formulated for kids under the age of five.&nbsp; So, we&#8217;re working closely with states, local health departments, pediatricians, families, doctors, and pharmacies to ensure the vaccine is available at thousands of locations nationwide.<br><br>We&#8217;ve already secured ample doses and the necessary needles and supplies specially made for kids in this age group.<br><br>Following FDA authorization, we would immediately begin packing and shipping doses to states and healthcare providers.&nbsp; And in short order following CDC recommendations, parents will be able to get their kids under five vaccinated at convenient locations, locations they know and trust.<br><br>While we know many parents are eager to get their kids the protection of the vaccine, we know others have questions.&nbsp; So, we&#8217;re working with our partners to ensure all parents have access to the facts and information they need to make the right decision.<br><br>And as always, we&#8217;re laser-focused on equity and making sure we reach the hardest-hit and most at-risk communities and families.<br><br>A year ago, we stood up a historic nationwide vaccination program that&#8217;s now gotten 75 percent of adults in the U.S. fully vaccinated.<br><br>We then launched a boosters program that&#8217;s gotten almost 90 million Americans their booster shot.<br><br>And we established the vaccination program, specifically for kids ages 5 to 11, that has protected millions of kids around the country.<br><br>Now with the potential vaccine for kids under five on the horizon, our message to parents and families is simple: We&#8217;re doing everything we can to prepare now.&nbsp; We&#8217;re taking all of the best practices and applying all of the lessons learned over the last 12 months to ensure getting kids under five the protection of vaccine is easy and convenient.<br><br>And we&#8217;ll be ready to start getting shots in arms soon after FDA and CDC make their decisions.<br><br>With that, let&#8217;s open it up for some questions.&nbsp; Kevin?<br><br>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Thanks, Jeff.&nbsp; We have time for a few questions.&nbsp; Please keep your questions to one.&nbsp; First, let&#8217;s go to Laura Santhanam at PBS.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks so much.&nbsp; Can &#8212; thinking about long COVID treatment, can you tell me just sort of latest updates with research about treatment availability and accreditation of clinics offering that treatment?<br><br>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Dr. Fauci?&nbsp; Long COVID treatments.<br><br>DR. FAUCI:&nbsp; Yeah, there is a very large study that&#8217;s been initiated some time ago &#8212; the RECOVER study &#8212; at the NIH in collaboration with other agencies looking at the incidence, the prevalence, and hopefully understanding the pathogenic mechanisms of long COVID.<br><br>Right now, the data are starting to come in.&nbsp; It&#8217;s too early to make any definitive statements.&nbsp; But for those individuals &#8212; and, as you know, long COVID means the persistence of signs and symptoms that are not explainable by any readily recognizable pathogenic process following the recovery from the acute infection.&nbsp; There have been subjec- &#8212; some suggestions that it is an aberrant inflammatory response, perhaps some element of autoimmunity, perhaps some elements of persistence of nucleotide fragments from the virus.&nbsp; All of these now are being actively pursued.<br><br>But before we can make any definitive statements, we need to learn a lot more about it, with the ultimate goal of figuring out how we might be able to mitigate or prevent some of those symptoms.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Next question, please.<br><br>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Let&#8217;s go to Jeff Mason at Reuters.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; My question is about the data and about habits.&nbsp; With regard to data &#8212; for Dr. Fauci or Dr. Walensky &#8212; what is your take on why the booster rate seems to be lagging?&nbsp; Why would people who have decided to get vaccinated, the first and second doses, not be getting more boosters?<br><br>And secondly, with regard to your &#8212; the data today with cases going down and hospitalizations going down, Dr.&nbsp;Lawensky [sic] &#8212; Walensky, do you think people should start to change their habits, and it&#8217;s okay now to maybe gather in groups more or to go out to bars and restaurants?&nbsp; Or what is the overall guidance right now, in terms of &#8212; in terms of gathering in groups?<br><br>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Hey, Jeff.&nbsp; This is Jeff.&nbsp; Why don’t we just start with the baseline on where we are in the booster data.&nbsp; And that is that about half of all Americans who are eligible for a booster have gotten a booster.&nbsp; Eligibility is five months or greater for the mRNA vaccines &#8212; Pfizer and Moderna &#8212; and two months for J&amp;J.&nbsp; And importantly, about 70 percent of seniors &#8212; those over 65 &#8212; have gotten a booster.&nbsp;<br><br>As you know, boosters are widely available.&nbsp; They&#8217;re at convenient locations around the country, and they&#8217;re free.&nbsp; And obviously, the impact of a booster, as Dr. Walensky said, is really important.&nbsp; So, we obviously want to continue to drive that number higher and higher &#8212; the percent of Americans who have boosters.&nbsp;<br><br>But over to you, Dr. Fauci.&nbsp; And then, over to you, Dr. Walensky.<br><br>DR. FAUCI:&nbsp; Well, Jeff, you know, I&#8217;m really not sure you&#8217;re asking a good question.&nbsp; It&#8217;s almost a psychological or sociological question: Why would people who had enough understanding of the risk to go ahead and get the primary series &#8212; why we don&#8217;t have more getting the booster.&nbsp;<br><br>I don&#8217;t have an easy explanation for that.&nbsp; That&#8217;s one of the reasons why we keep trying to put the data out.&nbsp; Because, as Dr. Walensky showed in her slide, the data are really stunningly obvious why a booster is really very important.<br><br>You first need to get vaccinated before you get boosted, that&#8217;s for sure.&nbsp; But when you look at the difference of how a booster, for everything you ask it to do &#8212; to reconstitute, from an immunological and from a clinical standpoint, the diminished protection that you get not only with waning naturally of immunity, but also the negative impact on some of the variants that elude the immune response &#8212; fortunately for us, when you boost with the standard vaccine, which is against the original viral sequence, that you get such a good response.&nbsp;<br><br>So, the only thing that we can do is to continue to come out with the data and to make sure the American public appreciates why it is so important for optimal protection to get boosted.<br><br>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Dr. Walensky?&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br>DR. WALENSKY:&nbsp; And maybe I&#8217;ll just add in there: With regard to where cases and hospitalizations are, I think we are all cautiously optimistic as we&#8217;re seeing cases come down week over week; down 36 percent over the last week.&nbsp;<br><br>I do think we have to use an important metric as a barometer, which is: How are our hospitals doing?&nbsp; And our hospitalization rates are still quite high and certainly having hospital capacity challenges in many parts of the country still.</p>



<p>So, with that barometer, we’ve said before, Omicron &#8212; “milder” does not mean “mild.”&nbsp; And so, we really do have to look to our hospitalization rates and our death rates to look to when it is time to lift some of these mitigation efforts.</p>



<p>We will continue to reevaluate, and we know people are anxious.</p>



<p>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Next question, please.</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Let’s go to Jeannie Baumann at Bloomberg.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, thanks for taking my question.&nbsp; I was hoping, Jeff, you could be a little more &#8212; when you said “short order” for the availability of those kid vaccines, I was hoping &#8212; do you mean like a week or a few days?</p>



<p>And then, Dr. Fauci, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the Pandemic Preparedness Plan that NIAID released today, and, you know, how the lessons from COVID helped drive some of those plans, and what type of funding do you need to implement it.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Yeah, so, on the vaccines for kids under five, we’re doing all the preparation now that we can do to be ready so that it’ll be available at trusted locations as soon as possible, post &#8212; I want to emphasize again &#8212; FDA and CDC recommendations.</p>



<p>We cannot begin actually packing and shipping until the FDA authorization, and then there’s the CDC ACIP process, which generally takes place a matter of days after the FDA.</p>



<p>So, we’re talking, you know, a matter of several days to a week or so, based on the 5- to 11-year experience from FDA authorization to when the first doses will start to be shots in arms.&nbsp; But we’ll move as fast as possible, pending the decision of CDC and FDA.&nbsp; And I think the preparation we’re doing now will enable us to do so.<br><br>The second part of your question?</p>



<p>DR. FAUCI:&nbsp; Yeah, I&#8217;ll answer that, Jeff.&nbsp; She was asking about the Pandemic Preparedness Plan.</p>



<p>You know, very briefly, Jeannie, it is really founded on what we&#8217;ve been talking about for some time now, which is the prototype pathogen approach where you get fundamental information, data, and preparedness on each of the multiple families that are projected to be as a risk.</p>



<p>For example, fortunately for us, we had been doing that with the coronaviruses when we got a lot of information from SARS-CoV-1 and MERS, and were already involved in the preparation of both platform technology and immunogen design.&nbsp; We planned to do that by selecting out anywhere from 10 to 20 families of viruses in which we can find common denominators within the family and do the immunological background to do the development of phase-one-type vaccines so that we could hit the ground running.</p>



<p>The second part of the program relates to both the development and the discovery of antiviral drugs &#8212; those that are already around, namely, have been used for other purposes &#8212; that we might apply them to whatever of the families that I mentioned a moment ago.&nbsp; But the other is to use the replication cycle of the virus &#8212; similar to what we did with HIV and what we&#8217;re doing with COVID-19 &#8212; to be able to develop antivirals against the whole family.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s just, kind of, a snapshot of the plan that the NIH just recently put out.</p>



<p>With regard to the budget, I mean, obviously it&#8217;s too early to talk about that because we&#8217;re in negotiations right now for what our budgetary needs are.</p>



<p>Thank you.</p>



<p>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Next question, please.<br><br>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Let’s go to Meg Tirrell at CNBC.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; One for Dr. Fauci and one for Dr. Walensky.</p>



<p>For Dr. Fauci: Are you expecting we&#8217;ll see an efficacy update with the data for kids under five?&nbsp; I think a lot of parents are (inaudible) unsure about how optimistic they should be feeling right now, when the last update we got was that the immune-bridging study didn&#8217;t meet goals.&nbsp; So, are you expecting to see that we&#8217;ll actually see this prevent cases of COVID?</p>



<p>And then, for Dr. Walensky, can you give us an update on BA.2 &#8212; its prevalence and your expectation for how it could affect, sort of, the curve of this Omicron wave?<br><br>DR. FAUCI:&nbsp; Yeah, Meg, thank you.&nbsp; I mean, obviously, we are anticipating that we will get a good efficacy signal for the use of vaccines in children under five years old.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But, right now, as you know, the FDA is looking at the data very carefully and, in their typical fashion, they will be very careful in scrutinizing the data and making a recommendation and a decision based on that data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, I don&#8217;t want to get ahead of them.&nbsp; But, of course, we&#8217;re anticipating we will get a vaccine efficacy signal that would allow for the use of this vaccine in children.&nbsp; But let&#8217;s wait for the FDA determination and, ultimately, the CDC recommendation.</p>



<p>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Dr. Walensky?</p>



<p>DR. WALENSKY:&nbsp; Yeah, great.&nbsp; Thank you, Meg, for that question.</p>



<p>So, our genomic surveillance now is detecting BA.2 projecting around 1.5 percent in this country.&nbsp; Of course, that varies for different parts of the country, but around one of &#8212; 1.5 percent projection of the sequences that we&#8217;re seeing.</p>



<p>What we know about BA.2 so far is that it does have a modest transmission advantage over BA.1.&nbsp; However, it&#8217;s not nearly the transmission advantage that we&#8217;ve seen between Omicron and Delta.</p>



<p>In terms of early studies, we have not seen any studies that suggest it’s more severe, nor have we seen studies that suggests that it will evade our vaccines any more so than Omicron has already &#8212; and, in fact, that our vaccines will work just like it has with Omicron.<br><br>So, in terms of how we anticipate this will impact cases: In many places we&#8217;ve seen BA.2 so far, cases have continued to come down, although at a slower rate.</p>



<p>In some case &#8212; in some countries, like Denmark, cases have gone up associated with BA.2, but that&#8217;s also in the context of relaxing mitigation strategies, mitigation measures, which is why we&#8217;re currently keeping those in place, among the reasons.</p>



<p>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks.</p>



<p>SURGEON GENERAL MURTHY:&nbsp; Jeff, can I add though &#8212;</p>



<p>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp;&nbsp;Please, Dr. Murthy.</p>



<p>SURGEON GENERAL MURTHY:&nbsp; &#8212; one point to Meg’s question?</p>



<p>Meg, at the heart of your question I think is something that many parents may be wondering about, which is: What&#8217;s changed between December when Pfizer shared their news and now?</p>



<p>And they&#8217;re &#8212; it&#8217;s a big change that&#8217;s happened, which is we experienced the Omicron surge.&nbsp; And with many children in particular, as well as adults, being infected and ending up in the hospital during the Omicron surge, it turns out that has actually facilitated the collection of important clinical data, additional clinical data that we did not have in December.&nbsp; Whether that changes the risk-benefit profile is what the FDA will be assessing.&nbsp; But there has been developments since December on the data front.<br><br>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Next question, please.<br><br>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Let’s go to Jacqueline Howard at CNN.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you for taking my question.&nbsp; I understand that, earlier this week, governors who met with the President expressed that they were seeking more clear guidelines from the White House on what the transition out of the pandemic and into a greater state of normality might look like.</p>



<p>Obviously, I know we&#8217;re not quite there yet.&nbsp; But my question is: When might we see such guidance?&nbsp; And can you give us any insight into if and how those guidelines will be prepared?&nbsp; What metrics will be considered?&nbsp; And how will that guidance be communicated to state leaders and to the public?&nbsp; Thank you.<br><br>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Well, as you as you can see from the discussion today, right now our focus is on fighting Omicron.&nbsp; While cases are coming down, as Dr. Walensky pointed out, there&#8217;s still a high level of hospitalization, largely driven, as the data shows, by the unvaccinated.</p>



<p>At the same time, we are always, you know, planning for the future.&nbsp; The most important thing that we have now, when comparing to a year ago, are the tools to protect people:<br><br>The vaccines and the effectiveness that we&#8217;ve talked about, particularly with boosters that offer the highest level of protection; a pediatric vaccine on the horizon; and treatments, including pills that are highly effective against severe disease and hospitalization.</p>



<p>So, we are in a much stronger position than a year ago.&nbsp; We have 210 million people fully vaccinated, including 75 percent &#8212; three out of four &#8212; of every adult.&nbsp; We had less than a percent when the President took office a year ago &#8212; people vaccinated.&nbsp; So, from 1 percent up to 75 percent of adults.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ninety-eight, ninety-nine percent of schools are open.&nbsp; That number was 46 percent when the President took office.</p>



<p>We have free tests, free masks, and booster shots widely available.</p>



<p>So, our progress over the last year and the tools we now have certainly allow us to get closer to a time when COVID doesn&#8217;t disrupt our daily lives but is something we protect against and treat.</p>



<p>And as we make more progress against Omicron, we&#8217;ll, you know, get closer to that point.</p>



<p>Next question, please.<br><br>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Let’s go to Zeke with AP.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; I was wanting to follow up on Jeff’s last point there and maybe get the doctors’ input as well.</p>



<p>In terms of that pathway to that vision of a point where COVID-19 doesn&#8217;t alter Americans&#8217; daily lives, you know, for many over the past couple of years it feels a little bit like, you know, the Charlie Brown football here, where it&#8217;s, you know, “Get vaccinated.&nbsp; (Inaudible) you need to get a booster.&nbsp; But even if you&#8217;re vaccinated and boosted, you still need to wear your mask to protect people who aren’t vaccinated.”<br><br>Is there a sense yet that you can offer the American public based upon your studies, based upon what you now know about Omicron &#8212; you know, is this the last wave?&nbsp; Is there enough that you can say, by a point certain, COVID will not impact people&#8217;s daily lives anymore?&nbsp; And if not, you know, why not?&nbsp; What else do you need to know?<br><br>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Dr. Fauci.<br><br>DR. FAUCI:&nbsp; Well, we have to be totally honest that we don&#8217;t know whe- &#8212; we believe that we are now going in the right direction.&nbsp; And the best-case scenario, as I and my colleagues have often described, is that with the tools that we have &#8212; the vaccination, the boosting, the testing, the masking, and all the other mitigations that we know about &#8212; when you have a level of community protection, which is the level of immunity throughout the community, that we will reach a stage &#8212; and I hope that it&#8217;s sooner rather than later &#8212; when, as you have said, this will not dominate our lives.&nbsp; In other words, it will be similar to the assimilation of this virus, in the group of viruses that we have learned to live with, without disruption of our society.&nbsp;<br><br>You know, the RSVs, the parainfluenzas &#8212; the influenzas where it&#8217;s there, it&#8217;s present, it hasn&#8217;t been eradicated, it hasn&#8217;t been eliminated, but it isn&#8217;t at a level that it essentially dominates what we do and dramatically influences our lives.&nbsp;<br><br>We believe we will get there.<br><br>We can&#8217;t guarantee that there will not be another variant that challenges us, but the best that we can do with that is to be prepared for it.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s why we&#8217;re doing all the things that we&#8217;re doing with regard to getting better, more advanced vaccine. &nbsp;For example, different platforms, different immunogen designs, development and discovery of new drugs &#8212; all of that will be part of the armamentarium that will ultimately, even with the appearance of additional variants, will get us to the point where we will not be dominated by this virus; where we can return to a degree of normality that we all crave for.<br><br>MODERATOR:&nbsp; All right, time for a couple more questions.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s go to Sheryl Stolberg at the New York Times.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks for taking this question.&nbsp; It&#8217;s for Jeff and for Dr. Fauci.&nbsp; Senators Murray and Burr have proposed a legislation that would create a task force to examine the initial emergence of the coronavirus and also assess the United States’ response across both the Trump and Biden administrations.&nbsp; It would be appointed by Congress, not by the White House.&nbsp; And I&#8217;m wondering &#8212; to Jeff: Is this something that the President supports?&nbsp; And for Dr. Fauci: Do you think it&#8217;s necessary to conduct an inquiry into the origins of the virus?<br><br>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Well, Sheryl, thanks for the question.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s start with &#8212; you know, we share the senators’ focus.&nbsp; A lot of the bill is about building stronger public health systems.&nbsp; And we appreciate the bipartisan goals to ensure the country is better prepared for outbreaks in the future, like COVID.&nbsp;<br><br>Right now, as we&#8217;ve been talking about, our, you know, focus is 100 percent on fighting Omicron and COVID.&nbsp; And while cases are coming down, the hospitalizations, as we discussed, are still quite high.&nbsp;<br><br>And across time, we do look forward to engaging with Congress and reviewing lessons learned from this pandemic.&nbsp;<br><br>So, I think that right now our focus is on Omicron, but we appreciate the work the senators have done and look forward to working with them.<br><br>Dr. Fauci?<br><br>DR. FAUCI:&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; Sheryl, I think it&#8217;s important to look at every aspect of this outbreak for lessons learned that is not only what the origin of the virus and the origin of the outbreak is, but many other things that we could learn from in the future so that we can prevent something like this happening or respond better if and when it does.</p>



<p>One of those is understanding what the origin of the virus is.&nbsp; And it’s very important.&nbsp; For example, studies were done with the first SARS-CoV-1 that we experienced in 2002 and 2003, and there was a mystery about how that happened.&nbsp; And then finally, after a lot of studies that actually took years to finally show that the origin was from a bat to an intermediate host to a human, very likely in a wet-market-type situation.</p>



<p>That was very important because that led to things that unfortunately were not followed, namely a better control in regulation of the wild animal trade and the interface between humans and animals.</p>



<p>The other one was MERS, in which it was shown finally that this was a bat reservoir that very likely infected camels and camels to human.</p>



<p>That also provides public health guidelines for the interaction of an animal-human interface.&nbsp; So, it would be, obviously, important to be able to determine how this went from what was very likely an animal reservoir &#8212; given the similarity with bat viruses &#8212; how that happened to go into humans to lead to this outbreak.</p>



<p>Understanding that will help us to prepare for any future outbreak, as well as prepare for a response.&nbsp; So, I’m definitely in favor of that.</p>



<p>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Kevin?</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Last question.&nbsp; Let’s go to Peter Sullivan, The Hill.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, thanks.&nbsp; There’s &#8212; a group of Democrats in Congress have called for $17 billion in the next appropriations package for global vaccinations and other aspects of the global response.</p>



<p>I’m wondering if the White House supports that, and are you planning to, you know, ask Congress for that in the next package.&nbsp; Thanks.<br><br>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; So, we have what we need in this current fight against Omicron, and we’ve done a lot to prepare for what’s ahead.&nbsp; We have boosters for all Americans, we’ve secured 20 million doses of the highly effective Pfizer pill.&nbsp; We’ve expanded supplies and stockpiles of PPE, including masks and gloves.</p>



<p>So, while we have enough money, enough funding for the current, immediate needs, we need to continue &#8212; as we’ve talked about &#8212; to stay ahead of the virus.&nbsp; And we are looking at a future where we will likely need funding for treatments and pills; we’ll need funding to continue to expand testing and to continue to lead the effort, as we’ve done with 1.2 billion doses donated to the world, but to continue to lead that effort to vaccinate the world.<br><br>So, we will be working with Congress as needed to make sure we have the funding to continue to fight this virus.<br><br>I want to thank everybody for the questions and look forward to the next briefing.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>3:44 P.M. EST</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">East Room</p>



<p>2:06 P.M. EST<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Thank you, thank you, thank you.&nbsp; I&#8217;m Joe Biden, Jill Biden’s husband.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; I want to thank you, Doctor, for that introduction.&nbsp; But I want to thank you more for all the effort you put in to change, save, alter people’s lives and your dedication to it.<br><br>And as we used to &#8212; I used to say in the Senate and I think it’s still said in the Senate &#8212; &#8220;if you excuse the point of personal privilege,&#8221; I&#8217;d like to &#8212; see that doctor on the end there?&nbsp; That&#8217;s the man who spent 18 months trying to save our son&#8217;s life.&nbsp; Doctor, I love you.&nbsp; The whole family loves you.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>Folks, the doctor’s optimism and fearlessness embodies what our Cancer Moonshot is all about.&nbsp;<br><br>And, of course, I want to thank Jill and Kamala and Doug.&nbsp; They just shared how personal it is for them and our families and &#8212; like so many of you.&nbsp; Every one of you have a story.&nbsp; Every one of you have a story.<br><br>And our message today is this: We can do this.&nbsp; I promise you we can do this.&nbsp; For all those we lost, for all those we miss, we can end cancer as we know it.&nbsp;<br><br>I committed to this fight when I was Vice President.&nbsp; It&#8217;s one of the reasons why, quite frankly, I ran for President.&nbsp; Let there be no doubt: Now that I am President, this is a presidential White House priority &#8212; period.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>You know, with the bipartisan members of Congress &#8212; and I’ve &#8212; I don’t want to start, because I&#8217;ll leave somebody out.&nbsp; (Laughter).&nbsp; But, you know, Congress is here.&nbsp; And this is, they can tell you, one of the truly bipartisan issues in the United States Congress.&nbsp;<br><br>I know there are votes, but that includes Senator Patrick Leahy, Michael Bennet, Amy Klobuchar, Chris Van Hollen, Sanford Bishop, Representative Joyce Beatty, Barbara Lee, Jim McGovern, Donald Payne, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Bonnie Watson Coleman, Tom Cole, Brian Higgins &#8212; I said I wasn’t going to do this &#8212; (laughter) &#8212; Terry Sewell &#8212; Terry Sewell.<br><br>And it can be truly an American moment if it’s &#8212; I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ve left somebody out, for which I apologize.&nbsp; But this can really be an American moment that proves to ourselves and, quite frankly, to the world that we can do really big things.&nbsp;<br><br>You know, we&#8217;ve made enormous progress in the past 50 years since Congress passed the President &#8212; and President Nixon signed into law the National Cancer Act and declared war on cancer.&nbsp; We learned cancer is not a single disease.&nbsp; We used to think, at that time, it was a single disease.&nbsp; There are over 200, as you all know &#8212; 200 different types of cancer caused by different genetic mutations in our cells.<br><br>We discovered new medicines, therapies, early detection and prevention measures that extend lives and save lives.<br><br>In the first 25 years since the National Cancer Act, the death rate from cancer was largely unchanged.&nbsp; Then things began to change.&nbsp; The progress over the last 25 years &#8212; the death rate has fallen by more than 25 percent.<br><br>But here’s the deal: Despite the progress of lives extended and lives saved, cancer is still the number-two cause of death in America, second only to heart disease.<br><br>In the last two years of COVID-19 pandemic, it’s taken more than &#8212; the pandemic has taken more than 800,000 American lives.&nbsp; But that same period of time, cancer has claimed 1.2 million American lives year in and year out.<br><br>For too many patients and their families on &#8212; diagnosed with cancer, instead of hope, there’s also bewilderment.&nbsp;<br><br>Remember, Doc, you telling the family that you had to be able &#8212; we had to be able to ask questions and you were available, because it&#8217;s a hard road to understand and traverse:</p>



<p>The feeling of being on your own, a <s>static</s> [statistic] adrift in a sea of patients, frustrated that hospitals and doctors can&#8217;t only &#8212; easily share your medical records or help find answers when there&#8217;s &#8212; minutes count.<br><br>Having to advocate for even the most basic care and attention for your loved one.<br><br>A flood of information &#8212; a completely different language, in many cases &#8212; with no one to help you decipher it.<br><br>Being within reach of therapy &#8212; a therapy that&#8217;s too expensive or your insurance won&#8217;t cover it.<br><br>Despite all the progress, there&#8217;s still a sense of powerlessness, guilt that maybe you&#8217;re not doing enough because you don&#8217;t know enough, and fear.<br><br>So, when President Obama asked me to launch our Cancer Moonshot in our administration, our goal was to bring a new sense of urgency to make the system of prevention, research, and patient care to take advantage of the 21st century science and technology.<br><br>We began the process.&nbsp; Many of you in this room were a part of that.&nbsp; We harnessed the resources of the federal government to change the culture, increase cooperation among scientists, and break down some of the silos.<br><br>I&#8217;d note, parenthetically &#8212; I remember I wanted to transfer a particular scan from a hospital in Pennsylvania to a hospital in D.C., and I was told they couldn&#8217;t do it &#8212; wasn’t able to do it.&nbsp; Could transfer just about anything else in the world, but they couldn&#8217;t do it because the hospitals didn&#8217;t want the other hospitals to have access to their &#8212; because the patients could change their mind with all the records.<br><br>That included everything from making federally funded cancer research more accessible to the public, instead of hiding behind a paywall.&nbsp; We launched Trials.Cancer.gov so everyone can look up cancer clinical trials across the country and around the world.<br><br>I traveled the country, bringing together leaders of<br>healthcare, technology, education, business, and technology.<br><br>I visited most of the major cancer centers, literally, in the world; met with heads of state in those countries; and decided how we could work together to try to make progress.&nbsp; I remember a particularly good meeting in Australia.<br><br>One of the final pieces of legislation that President Obama signed into law was the bipartisan 21st Century Cures Act with the help of members of Congress, particularly &#8212; I don’t know if &#8212; is Fred Upton here?&nbsp; Fred, are you here?&nbsp; Well, Fred Upton was part of it and Diana DeGette in the House.<br><br>It streamlined the Food and Drug Administration –- the FDA &#8212; so that new cancer treatments can be evaluated faster.<br><br>It provided seven years of new funding, including research on cancer disparities, trial networks to discover new drugs, and new efforts for childhood cancer.<br><br>The president of the Senate &#8212; as president of the Senate, I presided over the overwhelming vote, after the election had already taken place &#8212; the presidential election &#8212; when everything is supposed to come to a screeching halt &#8212; a bipartisan vote to fund over $6 billion.&nbsp;<br><br>And I watched my friend &#8212; and he is my friend; we disagree a lot &#8212; Mitch McConnell stand there and ask unanimous consent to name the cancer provisions after our son Beau.<br><br>The Cancer Moonshot brought the country and the world closer together on this issue.<br><br>And when we left office, Jill and I knew we had to keep it going.&nbsp; So, we took &#8212; and a lot of you &#8212; we had five Nobel laureates and others who were involved, through the cancer &#8212; the Biden Cancer Initiative.&nbsp; We focused on turning the Moonshot into a movement to create the cancer research and care system that most people think we already have and that they all deserve, but they don’t know they don’t &#8212; we don’t have it until they try to deal with it.<br><br>And everywhere we’d go, people would share their stories &#8212; in grocery stores, airports, rope lines.&nbsp; And while we heard stories of loss and despair, the stories began to change just a little bit &#8212; a change of feeling, real hope.<br><br>But not because of me and Jill, but because of all of you in this room and so many more at home: doctors, researchers, advocates, caregivers, patients, survivors.</p>



<p>And that’s why, today, I’m proud to announce our plan to supercharge the Cancer Moonshot as a central effort of the Biden-Harris administration.<br><br>It’s bold.&nbsp; It’s ambitious.&nbsp; But it&#8217;s completely doable.<br><br>Just as we harnessed the science to develop cutting-edge COVID-19 vaccines and treatments, we&#8217;ll bring a fierce sense of urgency to the fight against cancer.<br><br>The goal is to cut the cancer death rate in half in the next 25 years &#8212; at least by 50 percent &#8212; and to turn more cancers from death sentences into chronic diseases that people can live with; to create a more supportive experience for patients and their families; and, by doing these things and more, to end cancer as we know it.<br><br>And here’s what we’re fighting and how we know what cancer looks like today: a disease where we often diagnose it too late and we have too few effective ways to prevent it.<br><br>The stark inequities based on race, disparity, ZIP Code, sexual orientation, gender identity, and other factors still persist.</p>



<p>And we know too little about why treatments work in some patients and the exact same &#8212; that same patient with the exact same diagnosed cancer, it doesn’t work in that patient.</p>



<p>Where we still lack strategies to develop treatments for some cancers.&nbsp;<br><br>Where we don’t do enough to help patients and their families navigate through the process.<br><br>Where we don’t learn enough from patients&#8217; experience &#8212; experiences or their data.<br><br>In fact, when we first started this work, one of the first things we did was make sure that doctors and researchers work together, share information, allow patients to share their data<br>with other doctors and researchers to help others.&nbsp; But there’s so much more to do.</p>



<p>I remember when we were going through this in the Moonshot, and my saying that &#8212; I was told that “Well, patients don’t want to share their data.”&nbsp; They all want to share their data.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Sometimes you all don’t want to share what you know.&nbsp; (Laughter.)</p>



<p>And for each &#8212; (applause) &#8212; and for each of the ways we know cancer today, we know we can change its trajectory.<br><br>For example, to prevent cancer, scientists are exploring if the new mRNA vaccine technology that brought us safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines could also be used to stop cancer cells when they fail &#8212; when they first arise, get them then.<br><br>To target the right treatments to the right patients, we’re learning more about how to use genetics, immune response, and other factors to tell which combinations of treatments that are likely to work best for a particular individual.<br><br>To address inequities, we can target prevention, detection, and treatment efforts so that all Americans &#8212; whether they’re urban, rural, or Tribal communities &#8212; have equal access to cancer diagnostics, therapeutics, clinical trials.&nbsp; There’s so much more we can do.&nbsp;<br><br>And as I said at the beginning, this is a presidential priority.<br><br>I will do my part on funding and using my authorities as President to break logjams and speed breakthroughs.<br><br>I challenge and encourage all of you &#8212; all of you to continue to do your part.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This will be bipartisan.&nbsp; This will bring the country together and, quite frankly, other nations as well.</p>



<p>Here are some of the actions that I’m announcing today:</p>



<p>First, I’ve formed a new Cancer Cabinet, which is convened in the com- &#8212; we will convene in the coming weeks, to include members of the Cabinet who are here today &#8212; all of the people sitting on the stage here.&nbsp; They’ll drive a whole-of-government effort to unleash every possibility within our &#8212; within our power, within their jurisdictions.<br><br>The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, led by senior scientist and advisor, Dr. Eric Lander &#8212; sitting on the end there &#8212; will chart the path for the Cancer Moonshot for 2022 and beyond.<br><br>And I’m calling on Congress to fund my proposed ARPA-H &#8212; the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health.&nbsp; This will be a new kind of entity within the National Institute of Health &#8212; the NIH &#8212; with autonomy and authorities to drive unprecedented progress in biomedicine.</p>



<p>It’s based on DARPA.&nbsp; Most everybody knows, in this town, what DARPA is.&nbsp; That’s the Defense Department’s Advanced Research Project Agency that has led to breakthrough technologies that protect our national security &#8212; from the Internet, to GPS, and so much more.<br><br>ARPA-H will have a singular purpose: to drive breakthroughs to prevent, detect, and treat diseases, including cancer, Alzheimer’s, and diabetes, and other diseases.</p>



<p>And I think there’s strong bipartisan support for this, but it costs money.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s the best &#8212; these are the best dollars we could spend.&nbsp; So, we&#8217;ve got to get it done, and we got to get it done now and not wait any longer.<br><br>I&#8217;m also calling on the scientific and medical communities to bring the boldest thinking to this fight.&nbsp;<br><br>I’m calling on the private sector to develop and test new treatments, make drugs more affordable, and share more data and knowledge that can inform the public and benefit every company’s research.<br><br>And I’m respectfully calling on people living with cancer and caregivers and families to keep sharing their experience and pushing for progress.&nbsp; You&#8217;ll have a voice and a seat at the table, I promise you.&nbsp;<br><br>And here’s one thing we can all do: Americans have missed more than 900 &#8212; 9 million cancer screenings in the last two years because of COVID.&nbsp; Nine million.&nbsp; We have to get cancer screenings back on track and make sure that they are accessible to all Americans.<br><br>So, today, I’m announcing a call to action for cancer screening and early detection.<br><br>If you were supposed to get a cancer screening during the pandemic, call your primary care doctor today.</p>



<p>If you’re that doctor, talk to your patients.&nbsp; Get a screening scheduled, whether it’s in the office, at home, or through a telehealth visit.&nbsp; Because the Affordable Care Act now <s>will cover</s> [requires] most private insurance plans, as well as Medicare and Medicaid, to cover the recommended preventive care screenings free of charge.<br><br>I’m calling on companies, healthcare providers, non-profits, and others to step up, including developing mobile units and pop-up clinics to reach people where they live.<br><br>And if you’re putting off a screening because you’re afraid of what you’ll find &#8212; they&#8217;ll find &#8212; let me say this &#8212; and so many people are &#8212; put it off: Last November, I got a colon cancer screening.&nbsp; I’m glad I did.&nbsp; Trust me, I know cancer is scary.&nbsp; Going to the doctor’s can be scary.&nbsp; But screening is how you catch it early, before it’s too late.&nbsp; The earlier you get it, the better shot you have.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me close with this: There’s a quote that &#8212; when I made one of these speeches, years ago &#8212; five, six years ago &#8212;&nbsp;attributed &#8212; it was attributed to Yo-Yo Ma.&nbsp; I later was informed it was attributed to Vince Lombardi.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; But whoever the hell gave the quote &#8212; (laughter) &#8212; it makes sense.&nbsp; Here&#8217;s the quote, &#8220;Practice makes permanent.&nbsp; Only perfect practice makes perfect.&#8221;<br><br>My challenge to everyone involved in this fight against cancer: Take a hard look at your practice.&nbsp; Ask yourself, are you practicing perfectly or am I practicing to make the old way permanent?&nbsp; Old practices created data silos, minimized the role of patients, fostered the wrong kind of competition instead of the right kind of collaboration.<br><br>And I know we can get this right &#8212; I&#8217;m positive we can &#8212; by not losing sight of the ultimate goal: the patient’s health.&nbsp; And by not losing sight of something else I also believe: America is the single place on Earth &#8212; single country that can be defined, as I told Xi Jinping, by one word, “possibilities.”&nbsp; Possibilities.&nbsp;<br><br>When we work together in America, there is nothing &#8212; nothing beyond our capacity.&nbsp; Nothing.&nbsp; So, let’s show the world what’s possible.&nbsp; Let’s show the world that we&#8217;re committed.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s show that we can do big things &#8212; that in the United States of America, when we work together, there’s nothing beyond our grasp &#8212; I mean nothing beyond our grasp.&nbsp;<br><br>And I know of nothing, as I think my colleagues would say, that&#8217;s more bipartisan than take on this fight and fundamentally change cancer as we know it.<br><br>It&#8217;s a mission that can truly unify the nation, that shows us at our best, working together, and &#8212; rather than working against one another.<br><br>For every patient asking for one more day &#8212; I remember I&#8217;ve met &#8212; I met with over 3,000 researchers in the various organizations, and they&#8217;re good.&nbsp; They&#8217;re devoting their whole lives to try to save (inaudible).&nbsp; And they work really long hours, but they&#8217;re not practitioners.&nbsp; They’ve not had that patient come up and say, &#8220;Doc, can you give me just two more weeks so I can see my daughter married.&#8221;&nbsp; &#8220;Doc, all I need &#8212; can you do anything to give me just six more months to see the baby born.&nbsp; That’s all I&#8217;m asking for, Doc.&#8221;&nbsp;<br><br>There&#8217;s a sense of overwhelming urgency &#8212; overwhelming urgency if you’re patient or a family member of a patient.&nbsp; Every patient asking just for one more day.&nbsp; They&#8217;re not asking to “cure me.”&nbsp; One more day.&nbsp; One more week.&nbsp; &#8220;Can I get another year to be able to do &#8212; boom.&#8221;<br><br>For survivors and caregivers who carry the physical and mental scars of treatments and recovery, and for those who have lost, and for the ones we can save: Let’s end cancer as we know it.&nbsp;<br><br>I refuse to believe &#8212; I refuse to believe this is beyond our capacity.&nbsp; I refuse to believe it.<br><br>You know, when I put together the Cancer Moonshot, I was Vice President, and the President gave me authority to task anyone in the administration.&nbsp; And when they found out I had the Department of Energy and Ernie Moniz, when they found out I had NASA and a lot of other agencies, they looked at me like, &#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with you?&#8221;&nbsp;<br><br>I said, &#8220;Guess what?&nbsp; NASA knows more about radiation than all of you.&#8221;&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Seriously.&nbsp; And Ernie Moniz &#8212; we were at a place where you got a billion, billion calculations per second.&nbsp; And it goes on.&nbsp;<br><br>Skills people never thought would impact on this can do it.&nbsp;<br><br>So, my plea to you scientists is: Share data as best you can.&nbsp; My plea to my members in Congress is: Let&#8217;s fund this particular program and focus on it until we beat it.&nbsp;<br><br>And to the American people: Keep the hope alive.&nbsp; There is hope.&nbsp; There is hope.<br><br>And I&#8217;m confident &#8212; absolutely confident &#8212; if we make all our effort to deal with it, we can make fundamental changes in people&#8217;s lives and change the families in this country &#8212; in a much better position than they are today with regard to cancer.</p>



<p>Thank you all for being here.&nbsp; I appreciate it.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>Thanks, everybody.<br><br>Every time I&#8217;d walk out of my Grandpop Finnegan&#8217;s house in Scranton, he&#8217;d yell, &#8220;Joey, keep the faith.&#8221;&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; And my grandmother would yell, &#8220;No, Joey, spread it.&#8221;&nbsp;<br><br>Go spread the faith, guys.&nbsp; We can do this.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>(The President departs the podium and walks past the press.)<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. President, any comment on your decision to deploy troops to Eastern Europe?<br><br>MR. PRESIDENT:&nbsp; It was totally consistent with what I told Putin in the beginning: As long as he is acting aggressively, we&#8217;re going to make sure we reassure our NATO Allies and Eastern Europe that we&#8217;re there and Article Five is a sacred obligation.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">James S. Brady Press Briefing Room</p>



<p>12:35 P.M. EST</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Hi, everyone.&nbsp; Okay, as you know, today marks the second day of Black History Month.&nbsp; The President and Vice President are committed to fighting for equity, opportunity, and dignity for all Black Americans each and every day.</p>



<p>And yesterday, a couple of people asked me what we were doing, so I just wanted to give you a quick overview.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On Monday, the President issued a proclamation calling on the nation to celebrate the contributions of Black Americans, honor the legacies and achievements of generations past, reckon with centuries of injustice, and confront those injustices that still fester today.</p>



<p>The President, and Vice President, and First Lady, Second Gentleman, Cabinet officials, and White House staff will host meetings and activities this month centered around the 2022 Black History Month theme: “Black Health and Wellness.”&nbsp; This includes a focus on physical wellness, mental health, environmental justice, economic growth, and spiritual wellness.</p>



<p>White House senior staff will also host important stakeholder discussions on diversity in media, veteran wellness, and increased support for HBCU students.</p>



<p>Last but certainly not least, we will celebrate and acknowledge the invaluable role Black faith leaders have played in communities across the nation, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>



<p>This is, of course, just brief overview.&nbsp; Stay tuned for more announcements.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Zeke, with that, why don’t you kick us off?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; With the announcement this morning that the President authorized the deployment of 3,000 troops to Europe &#8212; the President previewed that announcement last week and then ordered it today.&nbsp; Is there something &#8212; some new piece of information or intelligence that he saw in the last few days that sort of went from being a notional thing to something that to &#8212; to an actual deployment?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I would not read this as a decision made based on any events over the last 48 hours or couple of days.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve been in discussion and under discussion with our partners and Allies in the region where these troops are going for several weeks now.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I would just outline for you &#8212; I know some of you may have watched John Kirby&#8217;s briefing, but just to give some more specifics: A thousand service members from the U.S. Army&#8217;s 2nd Cavalry Regiment, which is based in Germany, will reposition to Romania in the coming days.&nbsp; Secretary Austin had discussed this possibility and this deployment to Romania last week in his conversation with the Romanian Defense Minister.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Second, we are moving 1,700 service members from Fort Bragg to Poland, and approximately 300 service members from Fort Bragg to Germany.&nbsp; Both of these moves are to supplement existing U.S. force presence in Poland and Germany.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These forces are separate and in addition to the 8,500 personnel in the United States on heightened alert position &#8212; posture that we announced last week.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But I would also note, Zeke, just to finish &#8212; the answer &#8212; answering your question that, you know, the President has been clear since the beginning of the escalation and the building of troops at the border, and been directly clear with President Putin in &#8212; as he was in really December: If Russia stays on an escalatory path, which they clearly have, we will make force posture adjustments to deter and defend against any aggression.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is not troops that will go into Ukraine.&nbsp; They&#8217;re not fighting in Ukraine.&nbsp; These &#8212; this is us &#8212; this is the United States abiding by our commitments under Article 5 to support, reassure our partners in the region.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And for &#8212; what is the milestone the President is looking for to &#8212; for those troops to come back home?&nbsp; What is the &#8212; is it if Russia de-escalates, those troops would go back to their &#8212; to their bases?&nbsp; Is that &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I think, as you touched on, it&#8217;s not permanent.&nbsp; They&#8217;re not intended to be permanent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, again, we already had a troop presence in all of these countries where we are doing an increase in troops.&nbsp; So, I can&#8217;t give you an evaluation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Obviously, if Russia decides to de-escalate &#8212; to take de-escalatory steps, then certainly that would impact what the force posture needs are in other parts of the region.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator Hawley was out with a statement today saying that the &#8212; that the President should, sort of, take NATO membership off the table for Ukraine and that it wasn&#8217;t in U.S. interests to do that.&nbsp; Do you think that sort of rhetoric or, sort of, position by a U.S. senator right now is helpful in this &#8212; in this showdown between the West and Russia?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, if you are just digesting Russian misinformation and parroting Russian talking points, you are not aligned with longstanding, bipartisan American values, which is to stand up for the sovereignty of countries &#8212; like Ukraine, but others: their right to choose their own alliances and, also, to stand against, very clearly, the efforts or attempts or potential attempts by any country to invade and take territory of another country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That applies to Senator Hawley, but it also applies to others who may be parroting the talking points of Russian propagandist leaders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On a different topic, there&#8217;s been a lot of reporting in the last couple of days about how the U.S. is sitting, at per &#8212; on a per capita basis, with peer developed countries.&nbsp; The death rate in United States is far outpacing what’s being seen abroad, largely as a result of the lower vaccination and boosting rates here, as well as some other comorbidities and the like.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But does the President feel that he bears responsibility that, you know, a year into office, with this new wave, that the U.S. wasn&#8217;t better prepared and that more people are dying here on a per capita basis than are &#8212; than in Europe, for instance?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, the buck always stops with the President, and he would say that.&nbsp; But I would also tell you, Zeke, that the steps that we have taken to make progress, to prepare in the United States far outweigh what almost any other country in the world has done to date.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That includes ensuring that 87 percent of the population has had at least one dose; inclu- &#8212; continuing to increase the number of people who are boosted; ensuring we are taking steps to keep our schools open, to make sure communities that have surges have the federal resources they need.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, of course, we are still at war with a virus; that is continuing.&nbsp; And it &#8212; and that is the President&#8217;s top priority.&nbsp; He has said that before.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But I would also note all of those steps that we have taken to ensure we are prepared as we have ups and downs in this pandemic.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, sorry, just one last one.&nbsp; Yesterday, you mentioned that it’s the policy of the administration not &#8212; to no longer comment on conversations with Joe Manchin about &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I didn’t say “Joe Manchin.”&nbsp; I said &#8212; you were often asking me about Joe Manchin, so I think that was the context of the question, which is absolutely fine.&nbsp; But it is our policy to not give specifics or to &#8212; to try not to give specifics of private conversations the President is having with members of the Senate, members of Congress.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are times &#8212; I know, yesterday, of course, we had Senator Grassley and Senator Durbin here, and we did a pool spray of that.&nbsp; So, you may say that&#8217;s contradictory, but our effort and our focus is on making progress, and sometimes that means keeping those conversations private &#8212; oftentimes.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, I&#8217;m just curious because this is a shift from where you were a few months ago.&nbsp; Is that only because the Build Back Better bill failed?&nbsp; Is that &#8212; is that why this policy has changed?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I think it&#8217;s a recognition that a lot more progress can be made when you&#8217;re having private discussions, and that the President&#8217;s focus &#8212; in terms of what we&#8217;re publicly communicating, how he&#8217;s speaking to the American people &#8212; needs to be on what he&#8217;s doing to make their lives better, not constant updates on the legislative process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.&nbsp; On the troops that were deployed today &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; you’ve said that they aren’t going to be fighting; they&#8217;ll be there to offer support.&nbsp; Can you offer any details about exactly what they will be doing there?&nbsp;</p>



<p>And also, about the distribution to these specific countries &#8212; why these three places?&nbsp; And why the 2,000 versus 1,000?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure, well, what &#8212; to be clear, they&#8217;re not going to Ukraine to fight, right?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Correct.&nbsp; Right.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; In a &#8212; so, I know that&#8217;s what you were asking, but just for clarity for the transcript purposes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, this &#8212; our effort and our objective here has been to ensure we are ready for every contingency, and force posture increases as part of that preparedness.&nbsp; It&#8217;s to reassure our Allies &#8212; to whom, as I&#8217;ve said, we have a sacred obligation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This force &#8212; or these forces who have gone are trained and equipped for a variety of missions: to deter aggression, and to reassure and defend our Allies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In terms of why the specific numbers, I&#8217;d really point you the Department of Defense, who makes the recommendations and, ultimately, you know, proposes for the President to sign off.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I would note that a number of our NATO Allies have recently announced troop movements as well, similar to what was announced this morning &#8212; so, including the United Kingdom, France, Spain, Denmark, and the Netherlands &#8212; of their intent to deploy additional forces to reinforce NATO&#8217;s easter flank &#8212; eastern flank as well.&nbsp; So, this is a reflection of our robust capabilities and our ability to distribute them across Europe, but it&#8217;s also consistent with a lot of &#8212; what a lot of our NATO partners are doing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John Kirby said that the Pentagon has not ruled out deploying additional troops.&nbsp; Under what conditions would that happen?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; These, again, are &#8212; these decisions were based on close consultations with our partners in the region; the countries where these troops have been deployed to, of course; and also, the escalatory actions by Russia.&nbsp; But, you know, obviously the President is meeting with his national security team on nearly a daily basis and will make evaluations as needed.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then changing the topics: Senator Luján has been hospitalized after suffering a stroke.&nbsp; In addition to offering well wishes, of course, some of his Democratic colleagues have said this is a reminder that in such a close Senate, any unexpected development could be a challenge to moving forward their agenda.&nbsp; So, has the President spoken with Senator Luján?&nbsp; And does he share similar concerns?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Not at this point.&nbsp; I &#8212; let me just reiterate &#8212; I know you referenced them &#8212; but that we have all been thinking of Senator Luján and his family.&nbsp; I know his team put out an update on his recovery last night.&nbsp; And he&#8217;s 49 years old, so I would also note that.&nbsp; But I would point you to them for any specifics on his status.&nbsp; Of course, we&#8217;re thinking about him, his family, his entire team at this point in time.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m not sure what you&#8217;re referring to in terms of concerns about &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, Senator Coons brought up yesterday that, you know, this could be a challenge for moving forward since they &#8212; you know, that 50-50 split is so critical.&nbsp; So, is that something that the President has also considered?&nbsp;</p>



<p><br>MS.&nbsp; PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, life is precious, as we know.&nbsp; You&#8217;re most familiar with the average age of senators in the Senate, but that is true on both sides of the aisle.&nbsp; So, I would just say, we spend most of our time engaging in good faith about the President&#8217;s agenda and not making those calculations.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then just one more on the Supreme Court.&nbsp; Given the President&#8217;s commitment to diversify it, will he make similar pledges should he have another opportunity to nominate someone?&nbsp; For example, there&#8217;s never been an Asian American justice or an LGBTQ justice.&nbsp; So, will he make a similar pledge?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would say that &#8212; about judges or just in general, I would say that if you look at the President&#8217;s record of judges &#8212; circuit court judges, lower court judges &#8212; it speaks for itself.&nbsp;<br><br>He has had a enormous number of justices he &#8212; judges he has nominated who are people of color, who are women.&nbsp; He has nominated and confirmed an extraordinarily diverse bench of qualified individuals to serve on the courts.&nbsp; And that is certainly a priority for him.&nbsp;<br><br>I don&#8217;t have any new pledges to announce for you.&nbsp; But I think I would point you to his record, which speaks to his commitment to ensuring the court is more diverse &#8212; lower courts are more diverse, the higher courts are more diverse &#8212; and that that is something he certainly will continue to look at as a priority.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Oh, sorry.&nbsp; I’ll come back to you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That’s okay.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was just going to ask another follow-up on the troop movements.&nbsp; Is President Biden concerned that Putin might use them as a pretext to act against Ukraine?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I think what&#8217;s important to be very clear about here is that there is one aggressor here &#8212; that aggressor is Russia.&nbsp; They are the ones who have gathered tens of thousands of troops on the border.&nbsp; They are the ones who are threatening to invade a sovereign country.&nbsp;<br><br>NATO is a defensive alliance.&nbsp; The steps and actions we are taking are to provide reassurance and readiness to our partners in the region.&nbsp;<br><br>If Putin &#8212; President Putin and the Russians decide to de-escalate, that would be a welcome step.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And a follow-up on the energy issue.&nbsp; Qatar has said it will divert cargoes if needed but needs the U.S. to help mediate changes in supply contracts.&nbsp; Who is the U.S. talking to about diverting supplies?&nbsp; And are any countries willing to forego their Qatari supplies to help Europe?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I certainly understand the question.&nbsp; I would just note that we&#8217;re talking to a range of countries and suppliers, not any one individual country.&nbsp;<br><br>Obviously, Qatar is a large supplier of oil in the world, so that is certainly a statement of fact.&nbsp; But I don&#8217;t have any private &#8212; anything about our private conversations to read out from here.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And just a quick final one: Does Biden plan to watch the Olympics &#8212; U.S. athletes competing?&nbsp; I think it starts Friday.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yes, absolutely.&nbsp; We all do.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not going to rule out an Olympics outfit here.&nbsp; I would encourage all of you to do the same.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Yes, we are looking forward to it and to cheering on our American athletes who will be competing.&nbsp;<br><br>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just one more on the troop movements.&nbsp; Can you explain a bit more why the President decided to move unilaterally before NATO approved a multilateral deployment?&nbsp; I mean, you&#8217;ve talked often in here about how fiercely united the U.S. is with our NATO Allies.&nbsp; Is there a concern that this undercuts that sense of unity?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Absolutely not.&nbsp; And this is an important question because a lot of our NATO partners have done something &#8212; taken a similar step.&nbsp; In fact, five other of our NATO Allies have taken steps; the United Kingdom, France, Spain, Denmark, and the Netherlands have all said they have the intent to deploy additional forces to reinforce NATO&#8217;s eastern flank.&nbsp;<br><br>So, these decisions can be made on a unilateral basis by the United States or any of our NATO partners to boost up support.&nbsp; And obviously, the NATO Alliance as a whole would decide if there was going to be a movement of the NATO Alliance forces.&nbsp;<br><br>So, this is something that we have always had the capability to do, as an &#8212; as all these other countries do as well, and it&#8217;s an option, in addition to what we&#8217;ve done to support and plus up our NATO Alli- &#8212; our NATO partners &#8212; our NATO Alliance.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I think it&#8217;s still not clear though that &#8212; why?&nbsp; I mean, I know you&#8217;ve &#8212; we’ve been &#8212; you’ve been addressing this here.&nbsp; But why now, then &#8212; given that you&#8217;re saying there&#8217;s no new evidence that&#8217;s come to light, necessarily?&nbsp; It&#8217;s not that you have a sense that Putin is going to invade any more so than you thought a few days ago.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; That&#8217;s true.&nbsp; But &#8212; and I just noted that &#8212; that it wasn&#8217;t an event, because I think the way Zeke asked the question &#8212; “in the last day or two” or “over the weekend” or something like that.<br><br>There &#8212; this has been under discussion for some time now with our NATO partners and, of course, within the administration.&nbsp;<br><br>There &#8212; it is also true that it is &#8212; there’s no question that Russia and President Putin has continued to take escalatory, not de-escalatory, steps.&nbsp;<br><br>So, it is not that it is one moment.&nbsp; It is &#8212; we are looking at events over the course of time.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And at the risk of sounding like a broken record: On the Supreme Court search, has the President made any plans to meet in person with any of the nominees?&nbsp; Has he had any direct conversations with any of these potential candidates yet?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We’re just not going to provide updates from here on the process.&nbsp; Certainly, meeting with the nominees will be &#8212; well, obviously, with the nominee &#8212; but meeting with candidates will be a part of the process.&nbsp; But I don&#8217;t expect we&#8217;d provide a play-by-play on that from here.</p>



<p>Go ahead, Kaitlan.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; Two weeks ago, at his press conference, the President said quote, “We&#8217;re going to actually increase troop presence in Poland, in Romania…if in fact he moves,” referring to President Putin.&nbsp; He has not moved yet to invade Ukraine, as far as we know.&nbsp; So, can you explain, in the last two weeks, why that calculus has changed for President Biden?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I wouldn&#8217;t say the calculus has changed, as much as we look at a range of events over the course of time.&nbsp; And there&#8217;s no question that if you look at President Putin&#8217;s actions, they have been escalatory, not de-escalatory.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But clearly, he&#8217;s been &#8212; this has been a topic of discussion from &#8212; among our national security team and also between our national security team and their counterparts for some time now.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the President worried that Putin is going to try to invade a NATO Ally?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; The President wants to &#8212; we&#8217;re certainly hopeful he would not.&nbsp; But the President wants to take steps to reassure our &#8212; countries in the region that are part of the NATO Alliance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, you know, Russia is a country, President Putin is a leader who has invaded two sovereign countries in the last several &#8212; several years.&nbsp; You know, he&#8217;s somebody who has used chemical weapons.&nbsp; He&#8217;s somebody who has pushed propaganda around the world. &nbsp;<br><br>We&#8217;re not predicting that he has made a decision; we don&#8217;t know that.&nbsp; But we&#8217;re also taking the steps to be ready and to be prepared.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are removing these forces that are now being deployed &#8212; is that contingent on Putin removing his troops from Ukraine&#8217;s border?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Removing &#8212; oh, these troops &#8212; troops in Eastern Europe?<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 3,000 troops that the President is sending to NATO Allies that he signed off on yesterday, is that contingent on Putin de-escalating &#8212; not just de-escalating but actually removing his troops from the Ukrainian border?</p>



<p><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, if President Putin took de-escalatory steps, that certainly would impact our calculus.</p>



<p>But I don&#8217;t have anything to outline from here.&nbsp; That&#8217;s obviously a decision and recommendations that would be made by the Department of Defense.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; And one last question.&nbsp; Last week, I believe, in here, you said that you &#8212; the assessment still was that a Russian invasion is “imminent.”&nbsp; That&#8217;s the word that you used before, that other officials have used, and you used it last week.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But yesterday, the Ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said she would not use the word “imminent.”&nbsp; She said she does not think a Russian invasion of Ukraine is imminent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, I guess we just need some clarification on where that assessment stands right now.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I used that once.&nbsp; I think others have used that once.&nbsp; And then we stopped using it because I think it sent an &#8212; a message that we weren&#8217;t intending to send, which was that we knew that President Putin had made a decision.&nbsp;<br><br>I would say the vast majority of times I&#8217;ve talked about it, we said, “He could invade at any time.”&nbsp; That&#8217;s true; we still don&#8217;t know that he&#8217;s made a decision.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay, so you&#8217;re not using that word (inaudible)?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I think I used it once last week.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the decision now is that you&#8217;re not describing it as “imminent” anymore?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I haven&#8217;t in over a week.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead, Jen.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; Just another question, first on President Putin and, sort of, the message coming from Russia.&nbsp; He, yesterday, expressed hope for diplomacy.&nbsp; And after the U.S. announcement on troops today, the Russian Deputy Foreign Minister called the move “unjustified” and “destructive.”&nbsp; So how do you &#8212; what is your response to, sort of, their rhetoric of, you know, calling for diplomacy here, given what their posture is on the border of Ukraine?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I would say: Be very open-eyed about Russian propaganda and what they&#8217;re putting out there.&nbsp; We know what is happening on the border.&nbsp; Everybody can open their eyes and see they have gathered more than 100,000 troops at the border.&nbsp; They have also built up troops in Belarus at another border.&nbsp; That has not changed.&nbsp; We have not seen de-escalatory actions.&nbsp;<br><br>At the same time, we don&#8217;t know that President Putin has made a decision to act, and that ensures &#8212; means that we are going to, of course, continue to leave the door open to diplomacy.&nbsp; We&#8217;re going to continue to discuss and engage where we can find common ground with Russia &#8212; with Russian leaders.&nbsp; That doesn&#8217;t mean that we are going to bow to what their demands are on issues like NATO and what &#8212; and the right of any sovereign country to be able to choose which alliances they pursue.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve been clear on that from the beginning.<br><br>But, you know, diplomacy means you agree on some things, you disagree on others, you try to figure out where you have common ground, and that&#8217;s the process that we&#8217;re still undergoing.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On another subject, the House is working through the China bill right now, and there were some amendments that were released last night.&nbsp; There&#8217;s an effort by some House members to attach guardrails to CHIPS funding, which would mean they wouldn&#8217;t be able to get U.S. taxpayer dollars while also investing in China.&nbsp; Does the administration have a view on that?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I&#8217;m not going to get into any specifics about the negotiations that are ongoing.&nbsp; Certainly, the President is eager to sign the competition bill into law.&nbsp;<br><br>I would also note that Mr. McCarthy made clear he was going to whip against this bill, and let&#8217;s just think about how ludicrous that is.&nbsp; He is a leader in the Republican House.&nbsp; This is a bill that would help address supply chain issues.&nbsp; It would help make us more competitive with China.&nbsp; It would provide more than $50 billion in funding to ensure there&#8217;s chips manufacturing here in the United States &#8212; which would help, by the way, reduce and prevent inflation over time in an industry where one third of inflationary pressure is coming from, which is the car industry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, there are important discussions happening right now, but the whipping against this legislation &#8212; legislation that warranted a great deal of bipartisan support in the Senate &#8212; is certainly a question that hopefully House Republicans will have to answer for.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then just another China question on a little bit of a different subject, which is the COVID tests that are being sent out by the federal government.&nbsp; The Chinese company Andon Health owns iHealth, which is one of the providers.&nbsp; They have a &#8212; they signed a $1.3 billion contract with the Pentagon last month for these tests.</p>



<p>Is the administration concerned about, sort of, both the &#8212; the, sort of, optics and messaging of sending something to Americans&#8217; homes that says &#8212; says &#8220;Made in China&#8221; on it at the same time that you&#8217;re, you know, doing this thing that you consider to be a positive good for Americans, and just kind of the overall, you know, philosophy of giving federal contracts to China?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would say our objective continues to be to increase U.S. manufacturing capacity of tests.&nbsp; We also needed to meet a need that we had in this country for more tests and a shortage of tests and the understandable demand from people across this country to get tests and make them free and accessible, which required us purchasing some of those tests from China in order to meet that demand.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But that doesn&#8217;t change our commitment to increasing our U.S. manufacturing to ensure that we will be able to meet that demand with products made here in the United States over the course of time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; Yesterday, the national debt passed $30 trillion for the first time.&nbsp; Does the administration see that as a problem?&nbsp; Or do you share the view of some economists that debt doesn&#8217;t matter?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, the President believes we need to have a sustainable and responsible fixed fiscal policy, which is why he put forward ways to pay for his major proposals.&nbsp; He&#8217;s committed to a sustainable and responsible policy in ensuring that our long-term investments are fully paid for, like Build Back Better.</p>



<p>I&#8217;d also note that this stands in significant contrast from the previous administration and Republicans in Congress, which passed a $1.5 trillion tax cut for wealthy taxpayers in 2017 and didn&#8217;t pay for it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As we look to the debt, which obviously the President wants to be lower, it&#8217;s important to note that more than 95 percent of the national debt was incurred before he took office.&nbsp; The national debt increased by $7.8 trillion during former President Trump&#8217;s presidency, which accounts for about 30 percent of its total.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, we are working to address, we are working to be fiscally responsible, and that certainly is a priority to the President.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; One more on Afghanistan.&nbsp; There&#8217;s a new report out from the U.N. that says that more than 100 former members of the Afghan government and other Afghan allies of the U.S. have been killed since the Taliban returned to power.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are additional reports that thousands of Afghan allies of the U.S. are still in Afghanistan.&nbsp; They&#8217;re hiding out.&nbsp; They can&#8217;t get to the U.S. because of issues with a Special Immigrant Visa.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Does the administration consider it a priority to get these people out of Afghanistan?&nbsp; And if so, why are they still there six months after we withdrew?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We absolutely do.&nbsp; And we&#8217;ve &#8212; we have also helped thousands of our Afghan partners leave Afghanistan since our full withdrawal at the end of August.</p>



<p>As has been reported, there was a delay in &#8212; or there was a gap where there were not flights.&nbsp; Those have resumed, which is a good sign, which will hopefully enable us to continue to get more people out.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Obviously, the President also met with the Qatari leader earlier this week.&nbsp; They have been an important partner here, as we don&#8217;t have the diplomatic presence, as you well know, that we had prior.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I would just note that from the beginning, we&#8217;ve been able to evacuate more than 120,000 people from Afghanistan &#8212; some American citizens, many of them Afghan partners and allies, people who have fought alongside us during the 20-year war.&nbsp; And that is the largest evacuation since the Vietnam War.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, I would say we are still committed to doing this.&nbsp; We are not naïve about the challenges, nor are we naïve about the conditions on the ground, which is why we are so focused on getting humanitarian assistance to the people in Afghanistan through trusted and reliable sources.</p>



<p>But it is a good sign that the flights have resumed.&nbsp; Obviously, this was a topic of discussion with the Qataris earlier this week as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; Just on schools: New Orleans became the first major district in the country to have a vaccine mandate for all students go into effect yesterday.&nbsp; We know how you guys feel about the need to get vaccinated.&nbsp; But will the White House press other districts to follow in New Orleans&#8217;s steps?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We will always &#8212; we believe that it&#8217;s up to school districts to make decisions about what steps they put in place, and we would certainly advise all of them to follow CDC guidance.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the mandate: There are a number of exemptions that parents can apply for.&nbsp; It&#8217;s pretty easy to get an exemption.&nbsp; Does the White House think that sort of defeats the purpose of the mandate or is that okay?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We have exemptions that we implement in the federal government as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Staying on education: Yesterday, also, before the President paused student loan debt repayments &#8212; or, I guess, extended the pause in late 2021 &#8212; it was supposed to resume yesterday.&nbsp; Is the Department of Education pushing forward any other steps to make sure that when those payments relaunch in May, borrowers will be able to make them?&nbsp; Or will the President extend that pause again?&nbsp; Or is he still considering executive action to forgive student loan debt again?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; Well, I would note that no one has been required to pay a single dime of federal student loans since the President took office.&nbsp; As you noted, he extended that pause to May to give breathing room to borrowers who are still coping with the pandemic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He certainly also supports Congress for providing $10,000 in debt relief &#8212; a bill he would be happy to sign into law.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t have any additional executive orders to predict at this point in time.&nbsp; But certainly, in May, if these &#8212; if this resumes, the Education Department &#8212; the Education Department will continue working to ensure a smooth transition to repayment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; Last week, President Biden and President Zelenskyy discussed a macroeconomic package of assistance for Ukraine.&nbsp; What&#8217;s the status of those negotiations?&nbsp; What&#8217;s the scope and scale of that package?&nbsp; And what&#8217;s the holdup, given that the economic damage is happening in real time from the Russian threat and the U.S. already announced its economic package?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yes, we have been discussing with the Ukrainians an economic &#8212; a package of economic assistance.&nbsp; That package and discussion has been underway, obviously, with &#8212; at the leader level but also beyond.&nbsp; At this point in time, I think the discussion is with other counterparts from our government and theirs about next steps.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I mean, this was not the first economic package that we are providing to the Ukrainians.&nbsp; We have provided a significant amount of assistance &#8212; not just security assistance, but humanitarian and other economic assistance &#8212; over the course of time, so that would certainly build on that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But in terms of a next step, I can check and see if there&#8217;s any &#8212; anything specific to update you on.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; And just to follow up on the troop levels, why did the President authorize a deployment specifically to Poland and Romania?&nbsp; Are they considered the most vulnerable of the eastern flank countries &#8212; compared to, say, Hungary or the Baltics?&nbsp; And is it because the negotiations with the other countries haven&#8217;t worked out, or is it because these are considered the most vulnerable members?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I think as my colleague, John Kirby, conveyed, we&#8217;re also &#8212; we&#8217;ve left the door open to additional &#8212; I&#8217;ve nothing to predict on that front.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But this was based on &#8212; or this announcement and deployment was based on consultations and conversations with these countries where we have sent these troops.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have any more details about behind-the-scenes conversation to lay out from here.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; Senator Graham and Congressman Clyburn have been calling for educational diversity on the Court, suggesting the President should choose someone who attended a public university rather than an Ivy League school, for example.&nbsp; As the graduate of a public university &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Me too.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; does the President &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Who else here?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; does the President have any &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Public schools.&nbsp; (Laughter.)</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Inaudible) about the President.&nbsp; Does he have any thoughts on that as a graduate of a public university?&nbsp; Will that factor into his consideration at all?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure, I certainly understand the question.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve seen their comments.&nbsp; I would say the President&#8217;s &#8212; and we certainly appreciate Senator Graham&#8217;s thoughts and, of course, those of Mr. Clyburn.</p>



<p>What the President&#8217;s focus is on is choosing from a wealth of deeply qualified candidates who bring to bear the strongest records, credentials, and abilities that anyone could have for this role.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As you know, he has nominated judges who do not &#8212; have not gone to Ivy League schools.&nbsp; So I think that speaks to his value for that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But in terms of the credentials, I don&#8217;t have any more specifics to lay out for you today.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And related to that, though, I also just wanted to ask about candidates who have already gone through a judicial confirmation process &#8212; either for the district court level or the appeals court level.&nbsp; Is that something the President is going to be taking into consideration: whether they&#8217;ve already made it through the Senate Judiciary Committee once before?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; The President’s focus is, again, choosing from a wealth of highly qualified candidates who bring to bear strong records, credentials, and abilities to serve on the Court in a lifetime appointment.&nbsp; That is his focus &#8212; and also doing that through consultation with Republican and Democratic members of the Senate and experts, not on navigating the legislative process.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And shifting gears to one infrastructure question.&nbsp; The &#8212; a number of Florida Republicans have complained about the implementation of the new infrastructure law.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Who?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, certainly Governor DeSantis, Senator Rubio.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; What are their complaints?&nbsp; I haven&#8217;t even seen them.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, among the things they have complained about is they&#8217;ve suggested the state was shortchanged on bridge funding, that it should’ve gotten a bigger distribution.&nbsp; They&#8217;ve complained that the Everglades funding that was announced the other week should have been higher.&nbsp; Coming from Senators Rubio, Scott, and members of the House delegation who voted against the bill.&nbsp; Does the White House have any response to lawmakers who opposed the bill in the first place complaining that their share of the bill isn&#8217;t higher?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; It&#8217;s pretty rich, isn&#8217;t it?&nbsp;</p>



<p>I would say, first, I think the Everglades funding &#8212; I don&#8217;t have it in front of me, but I believe it&#8217;s in the billions, if I&#8217;m correct. You may have the exact number.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $1.1 billion.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; There is also an enormous &#8212; I mentioned this a little bit yesterday: About 90 percent of the competitive funding that&#8217;s available will go to localities, territories, others who can apply for it.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s why we put out this big book just a few days ago: so people know the criteria where they can apply for that funding.</p>



<p>You know, I think Mitch Landrieu, when he was here, quoted, I think, a Nancy Pelosi quote, so I&#8217;m just going to quote it.&nbsp; You know, I &#8212; you know, now I can&#8217;t even remember it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the point is, even if you vote against it, you still want the money.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve seen that over the course of time.&nbsp; That&#8217;s speaks to how political a lot of these votes were, given this is funding that will help rebuild a lot of these communities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And the President will certainly be making clear who was with him and who wasn&#8217;t with him.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And last week, the Vice President&#8217;s appeal to governors to help with the defense of voting rights &#8212; does the administration feel that the effort for national voting rights legislation is dead?&nbsp; And if so, is it now going to focus its efforts at state level?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We have to do both.&nbsp; So, federal legislation is important for a number of reasons, including that it creates a baseline of requirements &#8212; requirements or standards in states so people can know, who are fearful, about how they can vote; when they can vote &#8212; if you&#8217;re a mom of three kids, you should have a lot of options for dropping off your ballot or going to vote early; and ensuring those requirements are standard across states.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It also ensures that for states that have histories of voter suppression, that they would have to seek approval from the Department of Justice to make changes.&nbsp; That&#8217;s a good thing.</p>



<p>So, we are going to have to &#8212; we&#8217;re still fighting for those.&nbsp; The President has said he will fight for those until his last breath.</p>



<p>At the same time, what I think the Vice President was talking about and she will be playing a vital role in is working with states and localities on how we can fight against oppressive voter suppression &#8212; voter laws that are popping up in states; how we can empower and engage populations to ensure they know what their rights are.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So we&#8217;re ha- &#8212; we’re going to do both, and it&#8217;s important to do both.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And Mitch McConnell said today, given the current COVID facts and science, “It is time for the state of emergency to wind down.”&nbsp; Does the President agree with that?&nbsp; And is that still possible when there&#8217;s that hardcore of anti-vaccination people?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I didn&#8217;t see the full context of Mr. McConnell&#8217;s comments.&nbsp; I will say that the President&#8217;s view is that we&#8217;re not going to live like this forever; we don&#8217;t want to live like this forever.&nbsp; And our objective and our goal is on ending this pandemic as we know it today so we don&#8217;t have it &#8212; it is &#8212; so it&#8217;s not something that&#8217;s disrupting our daily lives.</p>



<p>We do more &#8212; we&#8217;ll do more and more to protect people and accelerate the path out of this pandemic.&nbsp; There is a lot of progress that&#8217;s been made.&nbsp; Two hundred and ten million people are fully vaccinated; that&#8217;s nearly 75 percent of adults.&nbsp; We had less than 1 percent vaccinated when the President took office.&nbsp; About 98 percent of schools are open.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And we understand the sentiment that I think he&#8217;s expressing, even if I haven&#8217;t seen the full context.&nbsp; We&#8217;re of course looking at, when the time comes, what it will mean to end the pandemic as we know it today.&nbsp; But right now, what our focus is on is ensuring we&#8217;re implementing the tools that we know that work as we&#8217;re still continuing to fight the virus.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead, in the back.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.&nbsp; The Pentagon says that Poland and Romania requested U.S. troops &#8212; U.S deployment.&nbsp; Have you received similar requests from other eastern flank countries, Baltic states?&nbsp; And what will trigger additional troops&#8217; deployment to the eastern flank?&nbsp; And I&#8217;m going to have one more.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; So, I&#8217;m just not going to detail those private diplomatic conversations.&nbsp; I would point you to the Pentagon if they want to share any more detail; I&#8217;d be surprised if they did.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But certainly we &#8212; those conversations are continuing; they&#8217;re not done. &nbsp;And I think my colleague, John Kirby, made that clear during his briefing today.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And one more.&nbsp; Has President Biden consulted this decision with the leaders of the Republican Party, and how does he feel about their support?&nbsp; Because there were some voices of the American Right questioning President Biden&#8217;s policy towards the Russia-Ukraine crisis.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would say that we have had an enormous amount of &#8212; we&#8217;ve done an enormous amount of briefing and engagement with Democratic and Republican leaders about the decision-making and how we&#8217;re approaching the escalatory nature of Russia&#8217;s behavior on the border.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Leader McCo- &#8212; or Senator McConnell made some comments in that regard last week.&nbsp; And this is an issue, in our view, that should not be partisan.&nbsp; What we&#8217;re doing here is we&#8217;re standing up for what have long been bipartisan American values, which is standing up for the sovereignty of a country; ensuring that they have the right and the ability to choose their own alliances; supporting them with a range of economic, humanitarian, and security assistance; and doing that in a way that&#8217;s coordinated with our partners and Allies.</p>



<p>There are some from the Republican Party who have not &#8212; not voiced support for that.&nbsp; And again, as I said a little bit earlier in the briefing, if you are echoing &#8212; if you are digesting Russian misinformation and parroting Russian propaganda, you may be on the wrong side of this issue.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi.&nbsp; Two questions.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first: Does the President know who Leonard Peltier is?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I&#8217;m sure he does, but I have not discussed it with him.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Just call me and let me know if he knows.</p>



<p>Is he aware of the push by Democratic senators and members of Congress and Native state legislators &#8212; and even Pope Francis, at one point &#8212; to send Peltier home from prison?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I have not discussed this with him specifically.&nbsp; I&#8217;m happy to see if there&#8217;s any more follow-up.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; And then my second question is about the Supreme Court.&nbsp; Some Republican senators, like Ted Cruz, are criticizing Biden for saying he&#8217;ll pick a Black woman for the Supreme Court. He said it’s, quote, unquote, “offensive,” because somehow the Black woman he chooses wouldn&#8217;t be the most qualified for the job.</p>



<p>But Republicans like Cruz also celebrated when Trump picked Amy Coney Barrett for the Supreme Court, with Cruz telling Barrett during her confirmation hearing, quote, “Your children have been wonderfully well behaved.&nbsp; I think you&#8217;re an amazing role model for little girls.&nbsp; What advice would you give little girls?”</p>



<p>So, my question for you is: Why do you think Republicans like Ted Cruz are acting so angry about Biden picking a Black woman for the Supreme Court, when they were very happy when Trump picked Amy Coney Barrett for the Court?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: I read that exact quote yesterday.&nbsp; I&#8217;m glad lots of people are following it.&nbsp; You know, I think that&#8217;s really a question for Senator Cruz.&nbsp; But it is important to note, as you just did in your question, that there has never &#8212; there was never an objection by Senator Cruz to Donald Trump promising he&#8217;d nominate a woman in 2020.&nbsp; You noted what he said to the woman he nominated in the hearing and how he applauded her in the hearing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The notion &#8212; the President&#8217;s view is the notion that there has not been a Black woman ever on the Supreme Court in 230 years is a problem with the process, not a lack of qualified, credentialed people to consider and nominate.</p>



<p>And, you know, that&#8217;s his view, but I think that&#8217;s a question best for Senator Cruz.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why do you think &#8212; what&#8217;s the difference between Trump picking Amy Coney Barrett and saying he&#8217;d pick a woman in advance, and Biden picking a Black woman and saying &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; That&#8217;s exactly why I called out this issue yesterday.&nbsp; But I am blissfully not a spokesperson for Senator Cruz, so he can best answer that question.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All right, thanks, everyone.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, just a quick question.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator Schumer is apparently coming here today to meet with the President about the Supreme Court pick and process.&nbsp; Can you confirm that?&nbsp; Do you have any other information on what their conversation (inaudible)?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I believe it was under discussion to figure out how they could connect, whether it was on the phone or in person.&nbsp; Let me see if I can get more details on it, but it&#8217;s part of the consultation process that you&#8217;ve seen take place over the past couple of days.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Thank you, everyone.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">East Room, The White House </p>



<p>1:49 P.M. EST</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE FIRST LADY:&nbsp; Hi &#8212; well, hello.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; (Laughs.)&nbsp; Thank you very much.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Please be seated.</p>



<p>Gosh, so many friends here.&nbsp; It&#8217;s so nice to see all of you.&nbsp; And you&#8217;re getting me so emotional before I have to speak about cancer.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, anyway, welcome to the White House.</p>



<p>And, you know, certain words have the power to make time stop: Malignant.&nbsp; Aggressive.&nbsp; Terminal.&nbsp; Cancer.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like a spell, they still the air around us.&nbsp; Frozen in place, we feel the world we knew slipping away.&nbsp; In the span of a breath, a thousand questions fill our minds.&nbsp; &#8220;What can I do?&nbsp; How do I tell people?&nbsp; Why did this happen?&#8221;</p>



<p>And when the hands of the clock begin to move once again, we are not the person we once were, but someone changed: a mother imagining all of the things she might not be there to teach her daughters, a husband wondering how he will juggle chemotherapy appointments with work and childcare, a son trying to be strong for the parents who could outlive him.</p>



<p>It’s not just patients; cancer changes everyone it touches.&nbsp; And in some ways, it touches us all.</p>



<p>For Joe and me, it has stolen our joy.&nbsp; It left us broken in our grief.&nbsp; But through that pain, we found purpose, strengthening our fortitude for this fight to end cancer as we know it.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Almost 30 years ago, four of my friends were diagnosed with breast cancer in one year.&nbsp; And one of my dear friends, Winnie, lost her battle.&nbsp; Winnie inspired me to take up the cause of prevention and education.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And since then, I’ve seen the darkness of this disease: financial devastation, confusion over care, and far too many families mourning loved ones.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet, I’ve also seen hope.</p>



<p>In just this last year, I met a woman whose life was saved by determined nurses who just wouldn’t let her skip her screening.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I met a doctor who was inspired to become a cancer researcher because she survived her own diagnosis as a child.</p>



<p>I’ve seen people come together from rival companies or opposite political parties, sharing knowledge and finding common cause, united by the chance to save lives.</p>



<p>A cancer diagnosis today may still leave us feeling hopeless, but we are not hopeless and we are not helpless.</p>



<p>We are living in a golden age of research and discovery.&nbsp; We can end this terror, and all of us have a role to play.</p>



<p>Because this isn’t just about hoping that one person will decipher the answers alone; it’s about listening to patients and survivors and their families, and easing the burden they face.</p>



<p>It’s about the individual choices we can make to stop this disease before it’s too late: to get screenings, to be vigilant with our health.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It’s about federal and state governments, the business community, and non-profit organizations all helping to make those screenings more available and accessible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s about bringing the brightest minds and the fiercest hearts to the table to learn and to collaborate and to discover together.</p>



<p>Yes, cancer has the power to rewrite our lives.&nbsp; But we have the power too &#8212; more than we even know.&nbsp; We can stop it in its tracks.&nbsp; We can comfort and discover and dream our way past its paralysis.&nbsp; We can come together and rewrite the story that cancer tells.</p>



<p>Now, as your First Lady, I’m deeply proud to be a partner in the commitments we’re making to the Cancer Moonshot today.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We’re ensuring that all of our government is ready to get to work.&nbsp; We’re going to break down the walls that hold research back.&nbsp; We’re going to bring the best of our nation together &#8212; patients, survivors, caregivers, researchers, doctors, and advocates &#8212; all of you &#8212; so that we can get this done.</p>



<p>And I want you to know that I’ll be there working right beside you.</p>



<p>So, I’m so honored to welcome all of you here to the White House today to take this next step.</p>



<p>Together, we will give Americans a reason to hope.&nbsp; We will use this power of this White House to make your life better.&nbsp; And we will build a future where the word &#8220;cancer&#8221; forever loses its power.</p>



<p>Thank you.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, it’s my pleasure to welcome out next speaker.</p>



<p>Vice President Harris knows the heartache of cancer, but she also knows how much hope can be found in our scientific community.&nbsp; She knows it because she saw it firsthand in her brilliant mother who dedicated her life to researching breast cancer.</p>



<p>Kamala, you honor your mom’s memory every single day, but I believe she’s especially proud of you today.</p>



<p>Please welcome the Vice President of the United States, Kamala Harris.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; END&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1:57 P.M. EST</p>
