<p class="has-text-align-center">James S. Brady Press Briefing Room</p>



<p>2:55 P.M. EDT<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Hi, everyone.&nbsp; Sorry, I think I jumped the two-minute gun.&nbsp; I was just excited to see you all on St. Patrick&#8217;s Day.&nbsp;<br><br>Okay, a couple of items for all of you at the top.&nbsp; Today, we wanted to highlight the strong unemployment claim data out this morning.&nbsp; In a little over a year, President Biden has brought the American labor market back to one of its strongest positions in history, driving a robust recovery from the economic catastrophe he inherited.&nbsp;<br><br>The number of new jobless claims Americans filing for unemployment for the first time fell below the pre-pandemic average in 2019.&nbsp; And the number of Americans who have been receiving unemployment benefits for more than a week fell to the lowest level since 1970.&nbsp;<br><br>Three hundred thousand fewer Americans are receiving unemployment claims now than before the pandemic.&nbsp; That means more Americans are getting back to work and fewer are drawing governmental &#8212; government benefits.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>As we&#8217;ve said many times, the data can be volatile week to week or month to month, so it&#8217;s important to focus on the broader trends.&nbsp; And those trends show remarkable progress across our economy over the last year, including the fastest year of job growth in U.S. history with 7.4 million jobs created and unemployment down to 3.8 percent.&nbsp;<br><br>I also wanted to mark another historic milestone of 500 million vaccines that we have distributed to the world &#8212; an unprecedented campaign reaching 113 countries, something that has never been done before.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>We did not get here by accident.&nbsp; This is a testament to the same whole-of-government effort we applied domestically, navigating logistical, legal, and regulatory processes to get lifesaving vaccines across the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>As we mark today&#8217;s milestone of delivering a half a billion vaccines to the world, let me be clear: Without additional funding from Congress to support getting shots into arms, USAID will have to cut short our crucial and effective efforts to turn vaccines into vaccinations.&nbsp;<br><br>Congress must promptly provide the administration with the urgent funding we need to continue the work of both vaccinating the world and protecting Americans at home.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Last thing I just wanted to note: As you saw this morning reported, Jeff Zients, who has served as our COVID Coordinator, will soon be leaving.&nbsp; So I just wanted to take a moment just to note his service and thank him from the President and all of us.<br><br>The President called on Jeff to lead our COVID-19 response because there is no one better at delivering results.&nbsp; I know this personally.&nbsp; I worked closely with him through many challenges over the course of many years in public service and government.&nbsp;<br><br>And the thing about Jeff is at every moment, at every opportunity, when there is a big challenge &#8212; a pile of manure sometimes &#8212; he dives right in to fix the challenge.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s what he does.&nbsp; That is what he has done time and time again through his career in public service.&nbsp;<br><br>And he led this effort to stand up a mass vaccination campaign; achieve equity in vaccinations across communities; ensure that Americans have access to treatments, tests; and embark on an unprecedented global vaccine campaign that we celebrate &#8212; can celebrate today.&nbsp; It would not have happened without Jeff Zients in this job and in this role.<br><br>And we are stronger that he is &#8212; his service and the service of his deputy, Natalie Quillian, who&#8217;s also departing, has literally saved lives in this country.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>So we want to thank them for their work, for their leadership, and we will miss them a great deal here.&nbsp;<br><br>Zeke, why don&#8217;t you kick us off?<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp;&nbsp; First, on COVID, the President has had a couple of close calls over the last couple days &#8212; the Second Gentleman and the Irish Prime Minister last night.&nbsp; Has he been tested today?&nbsp; And did he test &#8212; is there a result of that test you can read out?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; He was not tested today.&nbsp; He was tested last Sunday. &nbsp;Neither of these individuals were considered close contacts.<br><br>The doctors at the CDC determine what “close contacts” look like.&nbsp; And that &#8212; a close contact is someone who was less than six feet away from an infective &#8212; infected person for a cumulative total of 15 minutes or more over a 24-hour period.&nbsp; That is how they define it.&nbsp;<br><br>And, of course, our doctors look closely at that as well.&nbsp; And neither of these two individuals was &#8212; did he spend that amount of time with.&nbsp; And so, his weekly testing cadence remains as it has been; it has not changed.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I know there are a number of particular precautions that exist, you know, to protect the President and keep him safe and healthy.&nbsp; The testing cadence here is not like most people &#8212; or it has &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; That’s true.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; but this broader issue, though, of, you know, the President coming into &#8212; maybe not CDC “close contact,” but having close exposure to some people, even for a brief amount of time, it sort of &#8212; you know &#8212; you know, getting into that bubble around the President.&nbsp; You know, this is something that people around the country are dealing with on a daily basis, but they don&#8217;t have the same sort of precautions that are here.&nbsp;<br><br>So, you know, if the President hypothetically were to come down with COVID, is that something &#8212; or any &#8212; or the First Lady or anyone else in this administration &#8212; is that a failure at this point?&nbsp; Or is this just a new fact of life that everyone has to sort of, you know, make &#8212; you know, make peace with at this point?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well &#8212; (a cellphone chimes) &#8212; that was very soothing.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know where that came from.&nbsp; (Laughter.)<br><br>I would say our view is: While we&#8217;ve made a significant amount of progress across the country in fighting the pandemic &#8212; with more than 75 percent of adults fully vaccinated, according to the definition of the CDC &#8212; and obviously, we&#8217;ve seen hospitalizations come down across the country, including Washington, D.C., the President was very clear when he made his remarks about COVID just a few weeks ago that we are still working &#8212; we still have work to do to address the pandemic, to fight the pandemic.&nbsp;<br><br>That&#8217;s exactly why we need additional funding to make sure we have the types of treatments, the types of testing mechanisms to make them free and available to Americans across the country, to make masks available so that people who are uninsured or people who don&#8217;t have the resources can tap into a lot of these &#8212; these effective treatments and effective prevention mechanisms.&nbsp;<br><br>I would say, for us, you&#8217;re right, the testing &#8212; the testing modes are a little bit different around here because we are around the President of the United States and the Vice President and, of course, the First Lady and the Second Gentleman.&nbsp; That means, before you see the President, if you are in for a meeting or you travel with him, you are tested.&nbsp; And everyone has different testing cadences, depending on their frequency of seeing him.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, in anticipation of the call between the President and President Xi tomorrow, has the U.S. government made a determination whether China has decided whether or not to, you know, sort of agree to Russia&#8217;s request to provide assistance for its invasion of Ukraine?&nbsp; Is that &#8212; is it still a live ball that the President is going to warn President Xi of off of?&nbsp;&nbsp; Where are they in terms of making that decision?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; Well, why don&#8217;t I give you a little bit more of a preview on the call, and hopefully it will answer exactly your question.&nbsp;<br><br>The President, as I think you&#8217;ve heard him say before and I&#8217;ve said, is a big believer in leader-to-leader diplomacy.&nbsp; And they have a lot to discuss, given the last time the President met with President Xi virtually was last November &#8212; a couple of months ago.<br><br>The meeting tomorrow, in terms of how we got here, came as a direct follow-up to the meeting national &#8212; our national Security Advisor, Jake Sullivan, had with his counterpart.&nbsp; They talked about the two presidents meeting or engaging in the near future during that meeting.&nbsp; So, hence, it is happening tomorrow.&nbsp;<br><br>And that meeting, earlier this week, of course, came at an important moment in the conflict, but it also &#8212; in Ukraine, of course &#8212; it also covered issues beyond Russia&#8217;s invasion, and I would expect &#8212; of Ukraine &#8212; I would expect this meeting would as well, because there are obviously a range of issues that we continue to discuss with the Chinese and the President discusses, of course, when he speaks with President Xi.&nbsp;<br><br>But to go to your question, this is an opportunity for President Biden to assess where President Xi stands.&nbsp; There has been, of course, rhetorical support, or the absence of clear rhetoric and denunciation &#8212; or the absence of denunciation by China of what Russia is doing.&nbsp; This flies in the face, of course, of everything China stands for, including the basic principles of the U.N. Charter, including the basic principles of respect for sovereignty of nations.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>And so, the fact that China has not denounced what Russia is doing, in and of itself, speaks volumes.&nbsp; And it also speaks volumes not only in Russia or in Ukraine, but around the world.&nbsp;<br><br>And this call also comes as the &#8212; as Jake Sullivan&#8217;s meeting earlier this week, as we have made clear our deep concerns about China&#8217;s alignment with Russia and the potential implications and consequences of that.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>So the President will also share his assessment of that during the call, but I don&#8217;t have another &#8212; an update for you on any internal assessment.&nbsp; That is just how we are approaching &#8212; or he is approaching the call tomorrow.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How specific is the President going to be in laying out the consequences for China if they do help Russia?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, the President is &#8212; never fails to be direct, including in his conversations with President Xi.&nbsp; But we&#8217;ll let the call happen, and I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll have more to read out for you after the call.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And do you have any idea what military equipment they are thinking about providing Russia?&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have any assessment of that from here.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; And what do you make of the Putin comments basically calling for a purge of anti-war opponents?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I think this is a clear sign that this war is not going how President Putin planned for it to go.&nbsp; And there has been an outpouring of courageous protests and many speaking out against the war, even within Russia.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>So, his effort to crack down on dissent, to crack down on the freedom of press, on the freedom of media, on the freedom of protest is actually quite consistent with what we&#8217;ve seen his approach to be over the course of the last several years.&nbsp; But I think it&#8217;s an indication of exactly that.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which side requested this call between President Biden and President Xi tomorrow?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; It was discussed on the &#8212; during the call &#8212; during the meeting that our National Security Advisor had on Monday.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So are you saying it was mutually agreed upon?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; They mutually agreed to move forward with it during that meeting.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secretary Blinken just said that the U.S. is concerned China is considering directly assisting Russia by providing them with more military equipment to use in Ukraine.&nbsp; That is not something that we have heard from the administration before.&nbsp; And so, can I get you to speak to how high of a concern that is from the &#8212; for the White House right now?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; It is a high concern, a significant concern, given our Secretary of State just conveyed that.&nbsp; And certainly, our concerns about China assisting, in any way, Russia as they invade a foreign country is of significant concern and would &#8212; the response to that would be consequences.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before Russia invaded, the White House was pretty clear that if they did invade, there would be sanctions imposed on them as a result of that.&nbsp; With China, you&#8217;ve just said if they do help Russia, that there will be consequences, but you haven&#8217;t said specifically that they will be sanctions.&nbsp; Can you say, without saying what they are, that they will be sanctioned if they do help Russia with military equipment for this invasion?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I&#8217;m just not going to outline what the consequences would look like.&nbsp; And I &#8212; the President, obviously, will speak with President Xi tomorrow, and he&#8217;ll speak directly about that.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just on that point, just so I&#8217;m clear: I mean, I understand you don&#8217;t want to detail what the consequences could be, but the President in the phone call will make clear not just that there will be consequences but what those consequences could be to Xi?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll have more to read out after the call happens tomorrow.&nbsp; But we have not &#8212; our National Security Advisor, obviously, didn&#8217;t hold back in his conversation he had.&nbsp; Our Secretary of State did not hold back in his comments he just made publicly.&nbsp; And the President always takes the opportunity when he speaks with foreign leaders to be candid and direct.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You said the phone call is going to be an opportunity to assess where Xi stands. &nbsp;Should we take that to mean that it&#8217;s not clear that the Chinese have made up their mind whether or not to assist the Russians?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I think if you look at the last couple of weeks, Mary, you can see that they abstained from a vote in the U.N. Security Council, but they also &#8212; and they sp- &#8212; they had put out a comment during the Munich Security Conference defending the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, but they also echoed some of the conspiracy theories about chemical weapons and U.S. and Ukrainian intentions.<br><br>So, for any country, it&#8217;s a question of where you want to be as the history books are written.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And do you believe that this is a sign that &#8212; or can you characterize at all your understanding of how low the Russians may be running on some military equipment, given that they seem to be turning to China for some help?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I can&#8217;t provide an assessment on that from here.&nbsp; But, you know, I know my colleagues at the Department of Defense have conveyed clearly &#8212; and I&#8217;m happy to echo &#8212; that it&#8217;s not only not going as they planned; they have had challenges, obviously, with the operations of equipment, with the amount of equipment, even with MREs and food and other supplies.&nbsp; And, you know, that is what we have seen occur on the ground, but I don&#8217;t have a numerical summary from here.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.&nbsp; So, one of the clearest responses we have seen from the Chinese about their possibly helping Russia came from the Foreign Minister, Wang Yi, who told Spanish officials on a call, “China is not a party to the crisis, nor does it want the sanctions to affect China.”&nbsp; What sanctions are they talking about?&nbsp; Did Jake Sullivan specifically bring up the sanctions during the meeting in Rome?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I can&#8217;t speak to what he meant.&nbsp; You&#8217;d have to ask the Chinese.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Well, has the Chinese expressed the same thing to the U.S. &#8212; that they do not want to run the risk of being sanctioned?&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I would &#8212; the Chinese would speak for themselves.&nbsp; We typically don&#8217;t speak for others.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; So, just now, Secretary Blinken joined Ambassador Greenfield and the President in describing Putin’s actions as war crimes.&nbsp; I know that you said just yesterday that there is a legal process that is ongoing.&nbsp; How long does that process typically take?&nbsp; How much evidence do we need to collect?&nbsp; And can you clarify who will ultimately determine whether these are war crimes or not?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I think Secretary Blinken, in his remarks, also gave some specifics about who from the State Department will be leading that effort.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a legal process where they review all of the evidence, and then they provide that evidence and data and information to the international bodies that oversee the investigations.&nbsp; And the international bodies that oversee the investigations would make determinations about violation of international law and whether it&#8217;s war crimes by their standards and what the consequences would be.&nbsp;<br><br>So we would be supporting those efforts.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And do you know how long that usually takes?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; A legal process internally in the State Department?&nbsp; It can take some time.&nbsp; But again, I can&#8217;t &#8212; I would point to the State Department for any update they want to provide on the timeline.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; And one more on Jeff Zients.&nbsp; He and Dr. Ashish Jha, who&#8217;s going to replace him, have such very different backgrounds and different skillsets.&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Mm-hmm.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So what does that say about how the stage of the pandemic has evolved from then and now?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; Well, I would say: What it says is that Jeff Zient&#8217;s superpower is that he is an operational and managerial guru of sorts and someone who has taken those skills to a range of jobs he&#8217;s had throughout his career, including in the Obama-Biden administration when he oversaw the fixing of Healthcare.gov and oversaw the fixing of the technology that was severely broken and outdated within government at that time.&nbsp;<br><br>So, when we came into this administration &#8212; I would remind you it&#8217;s now a long time ago &#8212; there was no real plan.&nbsp; We were left no plan by our predecessors.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We needed to put in place a plan to not only get enough access to vaccines but also ensure there are enough vaccinators and vaccine locations.&nbsp; That&#8217;s a massive operational undertaking.<br><br>Right now, we&#8217;re at a point in the process where we have all of the tools and we know the operational systems that are needed.&nbsp; And so, right now, it&#8217;s the appropriate time.&nbsp; And Jeff, of course, made this decision on his own.&nbsp; He extended a couple of times to stay longer through some ups and downs in the pandemic.<br><br>We&#8217;re having a public health expert, somebody who&#8217;s as kno- &#8212; as well known as &#8212; Dr. Jha &#8212; is effective in communicating with the country about how we&#8217;re going to continue to approach and tackle the pandemic.&nbsp;<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; The President called Putin a “war criminal” yesterday.&nbsp; The Secretary of State just said that that was also his view today.&nbsp; So, given all of that, why are we still having Putin&#8217;s Russia broker the Iran nuclear deal talks?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would say that it&#8217;s not in our interest for Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon.&nbsp; And Russia is a member of the P5+1.&nbsp; So, that is the pursuit of a deal that would be in our national security interests.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, basically we’re just stuck working with him?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, again, I think how the President and any of the P5+1 partners or Europeans or others look at this is: If we can achieve a diplomatic solution where we prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon &#8212; despite the efforts by former President Trump to pull us out of the deal, allowing Iran to move far- &#8212; move closer to acquiring a nuclear weapon, that would be good for our national security and good for global security around the world.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act says that Congress is required to review any new agreement.&nbsp; This is obviously not the same agreement that Obama worked on in 2015.&nbsp; Does President Biden believe that this treaty needs the advice and consent of Congress?&nbsp; And if so, does he believe he has the votes to lawfully affirm it?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, if &#8212; if and when we have a deal &#8212; and we don&#8217;t have a deal at this point; otherwise, you would all know &#8212; we would carefully consider the facts and circumstances of any U.S. return to the JCPOA to determine the legal implications, including those under the Iran Nuclear Review Act of 2015.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re committed to ensuring the requirements are satisfied.&nbsp; So, certainly, we would abide by that.<br><br>But we have been keeping members very updated.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve been briefing them regularly.&nbsp; Brett McGurk conducted a call just a couple days ago.&nbsp; And we&#8217;ve been briefing them with a range of national security officials.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, has the IGRC &#8212; or &#8212; done any &#8212; or rather, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, the IRGC &#8212; has it done anything to be eligible to be removed from the terror blacklist?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I think you&#8217;re asking me this because it&#8217;s been out there as a possible discussion, but there&#8217;s no deal at this point.&nbsp; So, if and when there&#8217;s a deal, we&#8217;ll have a discussion about what&#8217;s in the deal.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Outside of the deal, though, does it take action to be removed from that terror blacklist?&nbsp; Do you have to do something to get off of it?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; You have to make a decision, yes.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; I want to ask you a slightly different version of a question that I asked you yesterday &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; about the $800 million military assistance.&nbsp; I asked if you could tell us how quickly it would arrive.&nbsp; And I understand this is a complicated process.&nbsp; To flip it around a little bit, can you tell us how quickly will the first shipment be out the door?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, we&#8217;ve been doing shipments or deliveries every day or every couple of days.&nbsp; And obviously, the Department of Defense would have more specifics.&nbsp;<br><br>But we have effectively and successfully delivered $300 million in military assistance to the Ukrainians on the ground over just the last two weeks.&nbsp; And our effort would be to continue to rapidly provide infor- &#8212;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And of this &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; &#8212; provide equipment.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; of this new tranche, this new $800 million announcement, can you give us &#8212; just characterize how quickly this round will start to be sent (inaudible)?&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, the operations of that would be led by the Department of Defense, so I would point you to them for more operational specifics.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And to stay on the Department of Defense &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; the Defense Secretary was speaking with his Slovakian counterpart who said that they were willing to send long-range S-300 surface-to-air missiles if the U.S. would backfill.&nbsp; Does the administration see this as a done deal, as something that is imminent, that would happen?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, it&#8217;s the decision of any foreign country, as a sovereign country, to decide what equipment they want to provide.&nbsp; What we are mindful of is ensuring that we are maintaining &#8212; we have to be careful in our desire to support other countries, that we&#8217;re not inadvertently impacting NATO readiness or capabilities or our own.<br><br>And again, this is something the Department of Defense can most effectively speak to, but a lot of these military systems would &#8212; some of them require months to manufacture or to build.&nbsp; We just don&#8217;t &#8212; we don&#8217;t have a warehouse of just military equipment that&#8217;s ready to typically be sent all the time.&nbsp; So, that is a factor.&nbsp;<br><br>But we want to find a solution that both enables Allies and partners to provide the support they have available to Ukraine, while addressing the very real need to backfill their defense systems, which is often a significant challenge.&nbsp;<br><br>And we just want to make sure that if and when our Allies are donating material, including us, they&#8217;re not leaving a gap in their own defenses.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; And just, finally, Ukrainian refugees are being turned away at the southern border &#8212; I know you’ve gotten some questions about this &#8212; because of Title 42, obviously put in place in the early days of COVID-19.&nbsp; Where is the administration in trying to work around this?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, right now, as I noted I think the other day, there are discussions about any ways we could be helpful in welcoming refugees into the United States, something the President &#8212; Ukrainian refugees, of course &#8212; we welcome many refugees, as you know &#8212; something the President is willing, of course; happy to do.<br><br>The role we&#8217;ve been playing to date, Kristen, has been really providing humanitarian assistance.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve provided $300 million in humanitarian assistance to the people in Ukraine and neighboring countries.&nbsp; A lot of that is going to help provide support to refugees.&nbsp; Three million in three weeks, which is a startling number, that are going to neighboring countries.&nbsp;<br><br>And the bipartisan funding bill the President just signed a couple of days ago provides more than $4 billion in humanitarian assistance, including $2.65 billion through the USAID International Disaster Assistance program, which provides everything from food, healthcare, other urgent support, and $1.4 billion for migration and refugee assistance to support refugees fleeing Ukraine.<br><br>But that is where &#8212; because the vast, vast majority of refugees want to stay in neighboring countries, that is where we have been focusing our energies at this point.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The President has been clear that he welcomes those who do want to come here.&nbsp; But given this law, it &#8212; are there discussions about revoking Title 42?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; The revocation of Title 42 wouldn&#8217;t be done in response to a war in a European country.&nbsp; It&#8217;s done by a decision &#8212; would be made by the CDC, and then it would be implemented when that is done.&nbsp; And it will be done, at some point, of course, with the interagency, including the Department of Homeland Security.&nbsp;<br><br>But, you know, there is a range of discussions about if there are ways for Ukrainian refugees to come.&nbsp; Right now, they&#8217;d have to apply, obviously, through existing refugee programs where they would apply from a third country.&nbsp;<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; Given the COVID surge in China and the lockdowns that we&#8217;re seeing there, is supply chain issues and, you know, those getting worse, perhaps, going to be part of the call tomorrow at all, or is it focused on &#8212; mostly on Russia?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; It will be focused on a range of issues.&nbsp; Certainly Russia and Ukraine &#8212; Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine will be a part of that, but our economic relationship with China, a range of issues of mutual concern will certainly be a discussion.&nbsp;<br><br>So, I don&#8217;t &#8212; I will &#8212; we will have more to read out for you once the &#8212; once the meeting concludes tomorrow.<br><br>And this is, of course, an issue that we are watching very closely.&nbsp; While the ports, I believe, still remain open, one of the challenges we&#8217;ve seen on the ground and we are tracking very closely is the number of manufacturing facilities or the number of workers who are not working.&nbsp; Sometimes there&#8217;s a lag in what that impact can be in terms of the production of materials and how that impacts the supply chain.&nbsp; So, we are tracking that very closely.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>But again, I expect this to be a wide-ranging conversation tomorrow.&nbsp; And we&#8217;ll have more to read out once it&#8217;s concluded.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, just to follow up on the President being around some people who’ve &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; now tested positive, why not just test the President every day at this point?&nbsp; The administration has done a lot in terms of, you know, saying certain actions are being done out of an abundance of caution.&nbsp; So, in this case, even if it doesn&#8217;t quite follow CDC guidelines or goes above and beyond, why not just do that because he&#8217;s the President?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Because we&#8217;re guided by his medical doctor, and he has kept him at the same cadence.&nbsp; And if that changes, then we will change how often he&#8217;s tested.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And is the cadence once a week?&nbsp; Or &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Go ahead.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; Questions on a couple of different topics.&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To try this a different way: Does the President have specific things he wants to accomplish in tomorrow’s conversation with President Xi?&nbsp; Are there specific deliverables he&#8217;s hoping to get out of it?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, this is, again, an opportunity for him to speak directly, leader to leader, about a range of issues.&nbsp; Of course, the invasion of Russia &#8212; Russia inva- &#8212; Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine will be a part of that, and what role or how &#8212; how President Xi sees the role of China in that conflict will be a part of that.&nbsp;<br><br>There&#8217;s also a range of other topics that they will discuss.&nbsp; But I&#8217;m purposely leaving some space for the President to have a direct conversation with his counterpart.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, on the COVID cases that &#8212; for example, with the Second Gentleman testing positive this week, why did the Vice President appear today &#8212; I understand she was masked &#8212; but in an event with other people around, when CDC guidance is currently that people who have been exposed should stay home and not interact with others for five days?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, she is fully boosted.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t actually believe that&#8217;s an accurate description of CDC guidance of having a close contact.&nbsp; We, obviously, all have had close contacts here.&nbsp;&nbsp; And you&#8217;re tested at a regular cadence.&nbsp; And she is abiding by that.&nbsp;<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; Just to kind of follow up on that<br>bit on COVID: Is one of the reasons why the administration is not going &#8212; being extra cautious with the President and the Vice President, even though there is national security issue around this, in part to kind of lead by example for Americans to say, “You can get back to living your normal lives, and you shouldn&#8217;t be concerned that even if you get exposed to somebody just briefly, you shouldn&#8217;t freak out about that.&nbsp; You don&#8217;t need to test a bunch of times”?&nbsp; Is that basically the dynamic that you&#8217;re trying to say &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp;&nbsp; Look &#8212; oh, go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; even though if the President &#8212; 79 years old &#8212; the President of the United States were to get COVID, it might be more serious than, you know, somebody in their twenties?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, we don&#8217;t know that.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right.&nbsp; We don’t.&nbsp; But (inaudible).<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; But we also know that COVID impacts people of all ages and a range of &#8212; but we take &#8212; what we do here, Jen, is not &#8212; not exactly as you said.&nbsp; So I wouldn&#8217;t agree with your description there.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>I would say we do take extra precautions, including individuals who are around the President being tested &#8212; that goes over and above, of course.&nbsp; He is the President of the United States, so we do take those additional steps.&nbsp; And we, of course, abide by what the recommendations and advice are of his medical doctor.&nbsp; And if that would be to do increased testing, we would certainly do that.&nbsp; But he does not feel that that is necessary at this point in time based on these recent contacts.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also wanted to ask about oil and gas companies and &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There&#8217;s been some reports, from the fourth quarter, of them increasing their stock buybacks.&nbsp; There was already, you know, a time when there was a spike in gas prices last year, I think in the fourth quarter.&nbsp; And you&#8217;re also just seeing the companies saying that they&#8217;re kind of reluctant to up production.&nbsp; And they kind of, in some ways, point to the administration&#8217;s policies overall in the sense that even if they were to up production, that, one, it takes months to get to market; and two, it doesn&#8217;t fit in with the overall approach that this administration is taking.&nbsp; So what do you say to that kind of viewpoint?&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I think it&#8217;s hard for them to make the argument it&#8217;s anything other than business decisions on their part, and they have said that themselves.&nbsp;<br><br>The CEO of Occidental Petroleum said, quote, “We have no need and no intent to invest in production growth this year.”<br><br>The CEO of Marathon Oil said, quote, “Our cash flow-driven return of capital framework uniquely prioritizes our shareholders as the first call on cash flow generation, not the drill bit.”<br><br>The CEO of Pioneer Natural Resources said, quote, “We&#8217;re not going to change our growth rate.”&nbsp; “We think it&#8217;s important to return cash back to shareholders.”&nbsp; That&#8217;s a business decision.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>The oil and gas industry right now is receiving profit &#8212; windfall profits; we&#8217;ve seen that.&nbsp; They publicly report their profits.&nbsp; They publicly report this information.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>And instead of keeping up with current demand, too many of these companies, in our view, are making the calculated decision of returning money to investors and shareholders through buybacks and dividends, instead of expanding production enough in the short term, which is what we need.&nbsp;<br><br>Again, it&#8217;s a business decision, but I think there&#8217;s clear evidence of them acknowledging and even shouting that out.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, I have a China question and, with full awareness of the news cycle, a St. Patrick’s Day question.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Oh, okay.&nbsp; All right.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; China question first.&nbsp; About a week ago, you said that for everything else, by and large, the White House saw China as still abiding by international sanctions.&nbsp; But on Russia, does that view still hold a week later?&nbsp; Is that generally how the White House views China?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have a new assessment of that.&nbsp; We&#8217;re obviously watching very closely.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; St. Patrick&#8217;s Day.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yes.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Given the fact that the President very much likes to share his pride of the Iri- &#8212; his Irish heritage but also the fact that &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; He does.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; so many ceremonial&#8211;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; “More Irish than Irish.”&nbsp; Is that what he said?&nbsp; “Irish Americans consider themselves more Irish.”&nbsp; I think that&#8217;s true.&nbsp; I will confirm that.&nbsp;<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But like that, and also the fact that so many of the ceremonial parts of the job &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; have been canceled over the past year, I&#8217;m wondering: Did he express particular frustration or sadness that the Oval meeting had to become yet another Zoom meeting today?&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; He was disappointed.&nbsp; He was looking forward to having the meeting today.&nbsp; And having meetings over Zoom, I think as we&#8217;ve all experienced, are not the same.&nbsp; Having spent a lot of time with the President, he is an extrovert, extrovert, extrovert and loves that engagement with people in person.&nbsp; And he was really looking forward to the meeting today.&nbsp;<br><br>There will be more in the future.&nbsp; We certainly understand we are still facing the pandemic.&nbsp; And there are more events that he has been able to participate in today to celebrate St. Patrick&#8217;s Day.&nbsp; So, fortunately, many of them still moved forward.&nbsp;<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; Yesterday, in his remarks to the Congress, President Zelenskyy called for the creation of this new global organization that he called “U-24. United for Peace,” described as an alliance that would supply assistance, including weapons, within 24 hours.&nbsp; I was wondering if the administration has a view on that idea.&nbsp; Is it something that you guys are discussing with Ukraine?&nbsp; And does the U.S. view this as Zelenskyy’s, kind of, alternative for Ukraine entering NATO?&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would say, just to reiterate, it&#8217;s up to NATO to determine who enters NATO.&nbsp; And obviously, any country, we would support their aspiration to join NATO should they choose and they meet the requirements.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>We, of course, did see him convey that in the speech.&nbsp; We don&#8217;t have more details.&nbsp; We are very closely engaged with the Ukrainians and speak with them every day.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Beyond that, I would say: In terms of the delivery of weapons, we do it as quickly as we humanly possibly can through our system and in coordination with our NATO partners and Allies.&nbsp; But we know &#8212; we support a range of ideas being put out there.&nbsp; We&#8217;ll discuss it with the Europeans and others and see if there&#8217;s more to report out from there.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also wanted to try one more time on &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; on the President and COVID.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Okay.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A lot of the questions are focused on testing, which you&#8217;re pretty clear that the testing cadence is not changing.&nbsp; As he looks particularly to a trip next week that is quite important &#8212; to Brussels and maybe elsewhere in Europe &#8212; is there anything else that he&#8217;s doing, I mean, as he&#8217;s having these &#8212; what the CDC does not consider a close contact but are certain people that he&#8217;s around and aware of &#8212; is anything about his behavior changing?&nbsp; Are there any other precautions that you guys are taking that are not testing-related?&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We have continued to take the same testing protocol &#8212; steps which are significant and go farther than CDC guidance goes.&nbsp; But beyond that, the te- &#8212; his testing cadence remains the same, and there haven&#8217;t been additional changes to our internal protocols.&nbsp;<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey.&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; The Kremlin responded to President Biden labeling Putin a “war criminal” yesterday by calling his remarks “unacceptable and unforgivable.”&nbsp; What is the White House&#8217;s reaction to getting criticism from Russia about the President&#8217;s remarks?&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; It&#8217;s pretty rich coming from a country where &#8212; whose actions are unforgivable in the eyes of the world &#8212; global community.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Given that there&#8217;s an ongoing legal process and investigation by the State Department into whether there was, in fact, war crimes committed, what is the purpose of the President and now Secretary of State getting ahead of that investigation?<br><br>I know you said &#8212; or the Pr- &#8212; you said yesterday that the President was speaking from his heart.&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is that what this is &#8212; just speaking from their heart?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I think Secretary Blinken was as well.&nbsp; And as you heard Secretary Blinken convey in his remarks, what we&#8217;re seeing &#8212; whether it is the destruction of a theater, where the words “children” or “kids” was written in Russian outside of the theater, according to photos; or whether it is the, you know, targeting of civilians, of hospitals, of maternity wards &#8212; if that&#8217;s not considered a war crime by human beings, what is?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>And there is a legal process that is important to continue that we have at the State Department that is ongoing, that Secretary Blinken spoke about.&nbsp; And any of that information and data we gather would go to the international bodies that would have prosecuted war criminals in the past.&nbsp; That&#8217;s where that information would go.&nbsp; It wouldn&#8217;t be the United States doing that; it&#8217;s the international bodies that do that.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>So, we will continue to feed information into that.&nbsp;&nbsp;But, you know, I think it&#8217;s important to call out what we see happening on the ground, and I think that&#8217;s exactly what the President and the Secretary did.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even though it would go to those international bodies, would the U.S. have a response if that investigation does conclude that there were war crimes?&nbsp; Would &#8212;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, typically, it&#8217;s an international response and it goes through these international systems for a reason.&nbsp; So we will continue to provide data and information to that process.<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, if I can have one more question on behalf of a colleague?&nbsp; There are growing calls from civil rights advocates and some lawmakers to pass Temporary Protected Status for Cameroon.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some have alleged a double standard in how the administration prioritizes pretominant [sic] &#8212; predominantly Black and brown countries when it comes to immigration.&nbsp; For example, it took seven months to grant TPS status for Afghanistan, but only took about a week to grant TPS to Ukraine.&nbsp; Is TPS for Cameroon something the administration is considering and looking at?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I’d point you to the Department of Homeland Security, who oversees that process.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; This morning, Senator Mitch McConnell was talking about Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson on the Senate floor, and he was specifically talking about how some of her supporters have framed her experience as a public defender.&nbsp; He said, quote, “If any judicial nominee…does have special empathy for some parties over others, that&#8217;s not an asset.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a problem.”&nbsp; He also said the President is “deliberately working to make the whole federal judiciary softer on crime.”&nbsp; Do you have a response to that?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; He also said he expected her to get confirmed with some Republican votes.<br><br>What I would say, though &#8212; because there are others in the Senate who have made faulty accusations about Judge Ketanji&nbsp; Brown Jackson&#8217;s record and specifically about her record on child sex crimes, so let me just take the opportunity to clear that up &#8212; not that most people have confusion about it.&nbsp;<br><br>But in the vast majority of cases involving child sex crimes, the sentences Judge Jackson imposed were consistent with or above what the government or U.S. probation recommended.&nbsp; For example, there are &#8212; there are arguments that have been made out there by Senator Hawley and others that &#8212; where he took a snippet of a transcript out of context, when, in fact, Judge Jackson was repeating something a witness said in order to ask a question about their testimony.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>So some who are accusing her of being, quote, “soft on crime” also failed to note that what was omitted is a sentencing commission report that&#8217;s been touted out there, was unanimously supported by a bipartisan Sentencing Commission.<br><br>She comes from a law enforcement family, has devoted her career to standing up for the rule of law, which is why she is endorsed by so many leading law enforcement organizations in the country.&nbsp; And attempts to smear or discredit her history and her work are not borne out in facts.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know Monday is a long ways away, given the news cycle &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; It&#8217;s all relative.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; Will the President stop at around 11:00 to watch the beginning of the hearing up on Capitol Hill?&nbsp; And will his schedule be adjusted around that?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know what his schedule is yet.&nbsp; I&#8217;m certain that he will catch coverage or catch some of her hearings over the course of next week.&nbsp; But I don&#8217;t know what his schedule looks like yet for Monday.&nbsp;<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; I have two questions.&nbsp; You have already announced President Biden’s trip to Europe, to Brussels.&nbsp; But there were also reports about a possible trip to Poland.&nbsp; Can you confirm that such a trip is under consideration?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have any more details about his trip to announce at this point in time.&nbsp; As we have them, we will announce them all to you.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One more.&nbsp; There are negotiations ongoing between Ukraine and Russia.&nbsp; Does the White House support those negotiations?&nbsp; And what &#8212; what&#8217;s &#8212; how can you describe your involvement &#8212; the U.S. involvement in those talks between Russia and Ukraine?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, we&#8217;ve been involved in a couple of ways.&nbsp; One, we&#8217;ve been leading the effort to build support in the global community to put in place sanctions that are crippling the Russian economy, to provide military support and economic support to the Ukrainians that strengthen their hand as they participate in these discussions and negotiations.&nbsp; And we also engage every day with Ukrainians to discuss.<br><br>Obviously, I would note that, as you know, our National Security Advisor also talked to his counterpart yesterday as well.&nbsp; But we are continuing to support the Ukrainians’ efforts.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>What our concern is, though, is &#8212; you know, these diplomatic talks &#8212; as they&#8217;re ongoing, we have seen no effort, no movement, no evidence that President Putin and the Russians are de-escalating.&nbsp; And that is really what we are going to continue to closely watch.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A follow-up on your point about Senator Hawley.&nbsp; Obviously, he&#8217;s consistently voted against the President&#8217;s nominees.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t think he was a swing vote you guys were counting on.&nbsp; However, will his criticism, will the explosiveness of this line of attack &#8212; do you worry that it will affect your ability to win over other Republican votes?&nbsp; Is there any concern about this campaign upping the pressure on, say, Senators Collins and Murkowski, who may be more amenable to voting for (inaudible)?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I&#8217;m not sure that someone who refused to tell people whether or not he would vote for Roy Moore is an effective and credible messenger on this.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; I&#8217;m going to try again on President Biden and President Xi&#8217;s call tomorrow.&nbsp; If you won&#8217;t detail the consequences of what happens if China does start supporting &#8212; more support Russia, might you indicate whether there are any carrots that the administration has prepared to offer, perhaps tariff reductions?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, this is a conversation about where President Xi stands.&nbsp; It&#8217;s up to the Chinese to decide where they want to stand, where they want to be as the history books are written.&nbsp; So I think it&#8217;s more through that frame than it is about carrots.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; And then just one more &#8212; two more, actually.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the administration continues to condemn and take action against Russia&#8217;s invasion on Ukraine, are there any plans to revisit, review, revoke the Trump administration&#8217;s recognition of Israel&#8217;s annexation on the Golan Heights and Morocco&#8217;s annexation of Western Sahara?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have any updates on that front.&nbsp; I&#8217;d point to the State Department.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But at this point, can you &#8212; can you describe just the administration&#8217;s position on the difference between Russia&#8217;s invasion on Ukraine and Israel&#8217;s annexation of the Golan Heights?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I’d point you to the State Department.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; And then one more.&nbsp; One more logistical question.&nbsp; Cambodia, the chair of ASEAN, has announced last week that the U.S.-ASEAN summit that the President is supposed to host on the 28th, I believe, is postponed.&nbsp; We haven&#8217;t been able to get a confirmation from either you guys or State.&nbsp; Can you clarify on that?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have any updates on the schedule.&nbsp; I know we were working through the schedules of a number of leaders, so that&#8217;s always a challenge and a factor.&nbsp; But I don&#8217;t have any updates.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So it’s still on the table?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have any updates on it.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.&nbsp; Two on COVID.&nbsp; There are some Americans who have received a second booster &#8212; i.e., for a fourth total shot.&nbsp; Is that something that the President has done or will do?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; He has not done that.&nbsp; If the CDC recommends it, he would get another booster.&nbsp; They have not.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, secondly, the White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain, in a tweet today, celebrated the idea that &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Uh-oh.&nbsp; (Laughter.)<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You know who he is &#8212; said &#8212; and that he tweets.&nbsp; You said &#8212; he said &#8212; celebrated the idea that there is a low number of Americans in ICUs today because of COVID.&nbsp; But he also wrote, quote, there&#8217;s a “great risk of a new wave.”&nbsp; And there are &#8212; certainly, we&#8217;re seeing cases surge right now in China and in Europe.&nbsp; And one of the truisms of this pandemic: If it&#8217;s in Europe, it ends up here a few weeks later.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What precautions and preparations is the administration taking federally and encouraging states to take ahead of a possible new COVID wave?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; So, what we have seen &#8212; and I think you&#8217;re talking about the BA.2 variant &#8212; and we are closely watching and monitoring the situation both in Europe and in China &#8212; BA.2 is a more transmissible version of Omicron.&nbsp; But we do know the tools the United States has &#8212; including the mRNA vaccines, therapeutics, and tests &#8212; all are effective tools against this variant.<br><br>And China has not used mRNA vaccines, which is an important component of how we&#8217;re seeing the response there &#8212; or how it&#8217;s impacting people there.&nbsp; But BA.2 has been circulating a little different from Omicron, when we were going through that surge in November.&nbsp; It has been circulating here for some time.&nbsp; We currently &#8212; it may be higher than this, but as of earlier this week, there were about 35,000 cases in this country.&nbsp; And we expect some fluctuation, especially at this relatively low level.<br><br>But this is an example of where the President&#8217;s Preparedness Plan that we rolled out just a couple of weeks ago, which lays out what the tools are that we need to move forward safely, is important.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>And what we&#8217;ve been conveying to governors, to go to your question, or leaders around the country and certainly members of Congress, is that just because COVID isn&#8217;t disrupting some of our lives in certain communities as much as it was a few weeks ago, it doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s gone; it&#8217;s not gone.&nbsp; And I think this variant is an example of that.<br><br>We do know what we need to manage it.&nbsp; But we are also at great risk of running out of money to do exactly that.&nbsp; And so that is a key part of what we&#8217;re communicating to governors, to members of Congress, and others about where we are with funding and the need to end some of these programs soon if we don&#8217;t get the funding we need.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just a very short, quick follow-up.&nbsp; Is there concern, though, that this variant, which is more &#8212; it seems very transmissible &#8212; is coming at a moment when a lot of Americans are seeing waning protection from their boosters just because the timing of the shots, as well as the fact that mask guidelines and other restrict- &#8212; regulations have been lifted across the country?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; It&#8217;s a good question.&nbsp; I would point to our medical experts to answer that.&nbsp; I mean, it is more transmissible, but we know it can be treated.&nbsp; So I think what it is &#8212; is a reminder of is that while it has decreased in many parts of the country, it is not gone, and it means we still need to continue to take steps we can to fight the virus.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Japan hosts the largest number of U.S. military, about 50,000 troops, about a half a million Americans at any given time in Japan.&nbsp; And many Japanese remember, at that time, Vice President Biden came all the way to Japan about 10 years ago when there was a terrible disaster, but there&#8217;s been no interview with any Japanese media.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Oh.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you think we could arrange that?&nbsp; Just to assure them that the treaty is enforced.&nbsp; Especially the Senkaku, the southern islands, they&#8217;re very worried about &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; The President does have &#8212;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Could we get a positive &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; He does have a great deal of affection for Japan and has spoken, of course, with their &#8212; the current leader a couple of times.&nbsp; I&#8217;m happy to take your interview requests under &#8212; under advisement.&nbsp;<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; I wanted to ask you about the refugee situation in Ukraine.&nbsp; Does the White House see the refugee situation that was created in Afghanistan last year as different than the one created by Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>And the reason I say that is &#8212; is your policy response different?&nbsp; I hear you say that your understanding is that neighboring countries &#8212; that&#8217;s where people are going from Ukraine right now and not necessarily coming here.&nbsp; But, at some point, is that going to not be an option anymore?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, it&#8217;s different, in part, for the reason you mentioned.&nbsp; That &#8212; in Ukraine, there are &#8212; while there have been 3 million refugees or about that number over the last couple of weeks, they have been &#8212;&nbsp;the vast, vast majority of them have moved into countries &#8212; neighboring countries who have set up really remarkable systems for welcoming these refugees at a really challenging and difficult time.&nbsp;<br><br>I know there&#8217;s been a lot of reporting from a lot of your networks in Poland and other places where they have had systems in place to welcome refugees.&nbsp; That has been the preference of a &#8212; of these refugees.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why we have been providing our humanitarian assistance to these countries and to Ukraine directly, in order to help augment the support in &#8212; in the best way possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Every refugee circumstance is different and has different needs and requirements.&nbsp; And we try to adapt our own response from USAID or from our refugee and migration programming and funding to meet what the needs are in that conflict.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also wanted to ask, on a completely different topic: The President, in the State of the Union, said that he would sign an executive order on identity theft.&nbsp; And I think he called it &#8220;pandemic aid fraud&#8221; or something similar.&nbsp; Do you have an update on where that is?&nbsp; I know it hasn&#8217;t been published yet.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, let&#8217;s see.&nbsp; What we know at this point in time is that &#8212; I mean, he talked about addressing unemployment fraud &#8212; right? &#8212; through the pandemic.&nbsp; And so, what we&#8217;re doing now is ensuring that we&#8217;re taking steps toward that.<br><br>Last week, the Department of Justice announced a new chief pandemic prosecutor.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re working to escalate efforts to crack down on bad actors and support and augment that.&nbsp; But in terms of the executive order, I don&#8217;t have an update on the timeline on it.&nbsp;<br><br>Go ahead in the back.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, two questions: one foreign policy, one domestic.&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; I like the setup.&nbsp; (Laughter.)<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Inaudible.)<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So are you &#8212; what do you make of the fact that there now appear to be Chechen and maybe Syrian regular forces fighting on behalf of Russia in Ukraine?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have any confirmation of that from here.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, on the domestic front, Kathy Hochul, the governor of New York, proposed today making changes to the state&#8217;s progressive bail reform law.&nbsp; And it looks like Mayor Adams, who I think we can describe as an ally of the President, would support those changes.&nbsp; So does this administration stand by it&#8217;s &#8212; what I would describe as a “wholesale endorsement” of bail reform?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I would have to check on the specifics of the New York changes.&nbsp; I haven&#8217;t looked into those.&nbsp; I&#8217;m happy to do that and talk to our Counsel&#8217;s Office about that, and we&#8217;ll get back to you.&nbsp;<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So the Chinese have been very public about how they&#8217;re going to continue their normal economic activity with Russia.&nbsp; Is the President going to press President Xi on that?&nbsp; And is he going to ask them to sort of back off their activity like the rest of the world?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I think that the conversation tomorrow will be a continuation of the conversation our National Security Advisor had with his counterpart earlier this week.&nbsp; And certainly, China&#8217;s alignment with Russia, in a range of ways, is and the potential implications and consequences of that are a central part of that conversation.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, domestically, on another subject, the Congressional Progressive Caucus Recommendations for Executive Action are out, and they&#8217;re asking for a decision to declare a climate emergency and ban all U.S. exports of oil.&nbsp; Is that something that President is thinking about doing (inaudible)?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; There are a range of really good ideas out there.&nbsp; The President is looking at all of them.&nbsp; But I don&#8217;t have anything to predict for you at this point in time.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One last quick one to start for the room: When is the President going to nominate a new Fed nominee?&nbsp; (Laughter.)<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would say that one of the most eminently qualified people ever to be nominated only withdrew her nomination, I think, 48 hours ago, 72 hours ago; it&#8217;s all running together.&nbsp;<br><br>He very much intends to nominate another eminently qualified person, but I don&#8217;t have an update on the timeline of that.&nbsp; Let the financial wires games begin.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.&nbsp; If the U.S. plans to still engage with Russia on the Iran nuclear deal and perhaps some of these other climate initiatives, what does President Biden expect Russia to bring to the table?&nbsp; I know what the goal is &#8212; that we don&#8217;t want Iran to have a nuclear weapon &#8212; but how does the President think that Putin will be helpful after the President rightfully turns him into a pariah on the global stage?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; As it relates to the Iran nuclear deal?&nbsp; I think that our view on this is that it&#8217;s not, obviously, in our interest and it&#8217;s not in Russia&#8217;s interests either for Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon.&nbsp;<br><br>And so, while these negotiations &#8212; I mean, the people are back in their capitals at this point in time, as you know, but they&#8217;re, for all intensive purposes, ongoing.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>There have been roles and implementation that Russia has had in the past.&nbsp; But I think what we recognize is that it&#8217;s not in their interest either.&nbsp; And we will consider &#8212; continue pursuing the diplomatic path forward.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then one more.&nbsp; The New York Times has authenticated emails that appear to have come from a laptop abandoned by Hunter Biden in Delaware.&nbsp; The President previously said that the New York Post story about this was &#8220;a bunch of garbage&#8221; and that it was &#8220;a Russian plant.&#8221;&nbsp; Does he stand by that assessment?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I&#8217;d point you to the Department of Justice and also to Hunter Biden&#8217;s representatives.&nbsp; He doesn&#8217;t work in the government.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.&nbsp; So, there are the recent peace talks going on between Ukraine, Russia, as was already mentioned.&nbsp; It seems that a couple of the things that are being floated &#8212; one, some sort of withdrawal by Russia, but they still hold on to these pieces of Ukraine they already have in the east and Crimea.&nbsp;<br><br>So, my first question is: Would the U.S. ever back that kind of deal if it&#8217;s something that Ukrainians agreed or felt they had to agree to?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We&#8217;re here to support the Ukrainians, but we&#8217;re not going to negotiate about a negotiation that has not &#8212; has not resulted in even the implementation of humanitarian corridors at this point.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fair enough.&nbsp; But the other thing that&#8217;s been floated by Zelenskyy himself is that &#8212; he basically said the other day, “Ukrainians, get used to that we’re not going to be in NATO,&nbsp;they&#8217;re never going to want us.”<br><br>But then, he said, “What we would like is some kind of other security guarantees.”&nbsp; Is that something that you&#8217;re talking about to them?&nbsp; And what on Earth would that look like &#8212; &#8220;security guarantees&#8221;?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; It&#8217;s a de- &#8212; it&#8217;s a decision for President Zelenskyy and Ukrainians to make if they&#8217;re going to pursue membership in NATO, a decision for NATO to make if they&#8217;re going to be members, including &#8212; in terms of other security guarantees, we&#8217;re in touch regularly with them but I don&#8217;t have more information of what that would look like.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Couldn&#8217;t &#8212; the President isn&#8217;t talking about some kind of long-term new mechanism where the U.S. somehow or Western countries or Europe somehow protect &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I think that&#8217;s a little premature at this point in time.&nbsp;<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I may, on &#8212; back to the weapons package.&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Up until now, the administration has been really very tight lipped about what was being sent to Ukraine.&nbsp; Yesterday, that all changed.&nbsp; We got a whole laundry list.&nbsp; Is that a change in strategy, in messaging?&nbsp; Is that a message for &#8212; you talked before about the Russian troop morale, for example, or maybe a message to domestic critics of President Biden?&nbsp; What&#8217;s changed there?&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, we made a decision that we wanted to be very clear about what types of security assistance we&#8217;re providing and how it is helping Ukrainians fight the Russian &#8212; Russia&#8217;s war against them.&nbsp;<br><br>And so, yes, you could say that was a change &#8212; a decision to make that information available.&nbsp; And we don&#8217;t typically, to your point, outline all of those specifics publicly.&nbsp;<br><br>So &#8212; but we did determine &#8212; made a determination to do that because we felt it was important for all of you and the American public to fully understand the range of military and security assistance we&#8217;re providing, how it&#8217;s working, and how it&#8217;s helping them in this war.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But was Russian morale a factor in that sort of decision?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; It was not, but it was more a decision about recognizing that everybody doesn&#8217;t always understand what many people in this room do when we say “security assistance” what that is and how it helps the Ukrainians fight this war.&nbsp;<br><br>And there is an understandable outpour of support, of compassion for the plight of the Ukrainian people.&nbsp; And we want to provide as much detail as we can about how we&#8217;re trying to help them in this war.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And if I may, you were asked about Hunter Biden&#8217;s laptop.&nbsp; You also, in October 2020, dismissed it as &#8220;Russian disinformation.&#8221;&nbsp; Do you stand by that assessment?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Again, I&#8217;d point to the Department of Justice and Hunter Biden&#8217;s representatives.&nbsp; I&#8217;m a spokesperson for the United States; he doesn&#8217;t work for the United States.&nbsp;<br><br>Go ahead.&nbsp; Go ahead in &#8212; okay, we&#8217;ll do the last one here.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.&nbsp; I have two questions: one on North Korea and China.&nbsp; North Korea fired new missiles the day before yesterday.&nbsp; What is the &#8212; President Biden&#8217;s reaction on this?&nbsp; And how do you analyze the type of missiles?<br><br>I have a follow-up &#8212; second question.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, we condemn North Korea&#8217;s missile launches.&nbsp; North Korea&#8217;s tests risk raising tensions and are destabilizing to the Indo-Pacific.&nbsp; Our commitment to the defense of the Republic of Korea and Japan remains ironclad.&nbsp;<br><br>As we have said and North Korean officials, including Kim Jong Un, have publicly noted, we continue to seek diplomacy and are prepared to meet without preconditions.&nbsp; But North Korea continues to not respond.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; When the &#8212; President Biden talks with Xi Jinping, the President of China, tomorrow, do &#8212; he are going to discuss with President Xi Jinping regarding on North Korea&#8217;s missile provocations?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I expect there&#8217;ll be a range of topics discussed, including security in the region, but we&#8217;ll have more to read out when that conversation continu- &#8212; is done.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Thanks, everyone.&nbsp; See you tomorrow.<br><br>3:49 P.M. EDT</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">The White House</p>



<p>Thank you! It’s my pleasure to welcome all of you—so many good friends—to the White House!<br><br>And we are pleased to welcome the Taoiseach of Ireland, Micheál Martin, and his wife Mary, as well as the Irish Delegation, to Washington, D.C.<br><br>To love Joe Biden is to know Ireland. Picture me on our first few dates, dressed in bell bottoms and a peasant shirt. <br><br>I wore my hair down to my waist—and at the time, so did most of the men I dated. <br><br>And then there was this Senator, handsome and buttoned up in his suit and loafers—casually quoting Yeats.<br><br>It was the last thing I expected—but in the end, he won me over. <br><br>It doesn’t matter when Joe’s ancestors left—a piece of that island was passed down to each generation in memories, and stories, and family lore, held close like a precious gem—an emerald heart that shines like the light after a storm.<br><br>It’s a loyalty that knows “family” means forever.<br><br>A faith—tried and tested by famine and war.<br><br>An optimism brave enough to leave the life you know behind, and find what’s waiting on distant shores.<br><br>He’s not alone, of course. <br><br>Like so many generations of immigrants, Irish Americans brought the best of their home with them on wind and steam ships so many years ago. <br><br>Ridiculed and despised, they found ways to create new traditions, while never letting go of the legacies that made them, enriching our country along the way.<br><br>So it’s fitting that we honor that heritage by celebrating Saint Patrick, a man who brought faith to Ireland, enriching it, too. <br><br>There has always been a divine spark in the open arms of welcome. <br><br>Yes, I got to know Ireland through the eyes of Joe Biden. <br><br>On St. Patrick’s Day, all Americans, no matter their background, fall in love with it too.<br><br>We reach for a legacy buried deep inside of us—or gifted second-hand.<br><br>We celebrate a spirit that defies struggle.<br><br>We recognize the rich tapestry of our history—threads of clover green amid the red, white, and blue. <br><br>Happy St. Patrick’s Day. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Rayburn Room<br>U.S. Capitol</p>



<p>12:43 P.M. EDT</p>



<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Thank you very much, Nancy.&nbsp; That was very kind.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Thank you, thank you, thank you.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>



<p>Father, before I begin &#8212; bless me, Father, for I’m about to sin.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; I &#8212; well, I just want you to know, I may be Irish, but I&#8217;m not stupid.&nbsp; I married Dominic Giacoppa’s daughter.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Okay?&nbsp; (Inaudible.)</p>



<p>Look, thank you very much, Nancy, for that very gracious and very over-the-top introduction.&nbsp; I appreciate it very much.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You know, I just got off the &#8212; on the way up, before I came up here, I was on the Zoom, as we say, with the Taoiseach for about 45 minutes.&nbsp; And he is &#8212; he&#8217;s looking well, he feels well.&nbsp; He&#8217;s tested positive, but he feels well.&nbsp; He looks good.&nbsp; And he wanted to &#8212; I know the Ambassador is here to bring his regards, but he is &#8212; he&#8217;s really sorry he can&#8217;t be here, and he was looking forward to it, as was his wife.</p>



<p>You know, the good spirits and feelings, as well, that exist on St. Patrick&#8217;s Day seems to be one of those few times and not &#8212; well, not &#8212; I shouldn’t say “a few” &#8212; we should have more times like this where Democrats and Republicans get together, and we actually not only agree on one thing, but we remind ourselves we actually like each other.&nbsp; (Laughs.)&nbsp; And it&#8217;s a useful thing.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; And, I &#8212;</p>



<p>You know, Yeats wrote, and I quote, “Talent perceives differences; genius, unity.”&nbsp; “Talents perceives differences; genius, unity.”&nbsp; And, you know, I think today we can add a fifth item to at least my Unity Agenda, and that&#8217;s support of our relationship between Ireland and the United States, which has taken on an even more intense and cooperative form than it ever has, because of Ireland&#8217;s neutrality.</p>



<p>On this issue, it brings together Speaker Pelosi, Leader McCarthy, Richie Neal &#8212; who is Irish, as we say where I come from, from the belt buckle to shoe sole &#8212; (laughter) &#8212; and &#8212; and the leaders of both our parties, and all the Friends of Ireland.</p>



<p>I &#8212; you know, I&#8217;m the proud son of Catherine Eugenia Finnegan Biden.&nbsp; And like so many Americans of Irish heritage, I love Ireland and I was raised in a circumstance where you would have thought my whole family &#8212; none of &#8212; they came in 1844 and 1845, but you’d think they’d all lived in Ireland the last 60 years &#8212; the previous 60 years.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The &#8212; there&#8217;s &#8212; as I was talking to Taoiseach today, the Irish on St. Patrick&#8217;s Day think that &#8212; Irish Americans think they&#8217;re more Irish than the Irish.&nbsp; And &#8212; but that&#8217;s kind of how I was raised, like so many Americans of Irish heritage &#8212; like other people of other heritage as well.</p>



<p>I was &#8212; it was imbued in me to be proud of &#8212; proud of my heritage.  And, you know, the pride that was passed down to generations of our family, even though they&#8217;ve been here since the mid-1800s.  And it was just part of the air we breathed, especially up in Scranton and &#8212; where we lived with my &#8212; near my grandpop. </p>



<p>My grandfather, Ambrose Finnegan, used to say &#8212; and I mean this &#8212; he’d say, “Joey, if you’re lucky enough to be Irish, you&#8217;re lucky enough.”&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Every time something bad happened, I’d go, “I don’t &#8212; I’m not sure.”&nbsp; (Laughs.)&nbsp; Anyway.</p>



<p>But because of being an Irish family, family was everything.&nbsp; My dad&#8217;s expression was, “Family is the beginning, the middle, and the end.”&nbsp; And &#8212; and he meant it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And &#8212; but, you know, the faith we share with one another and the resilience that we&#8217;ve all gone through, both in America and in Ireland, you know, are ones that we&#8217;ve been knocked down sometimes.&nbsp; Just knocked flat on our back.</p>



<p>And my &#8212; my mom&#8217;s expression, for real, was, “Joey, get up.&nbsp; Just get up.&nbsp; Get up.”&nbsp; It’s a simple proposition.&nbsp; It was sort of the Irish of it.&nbsp; You just get up, no matter what.&nbsp; Dust yourself off and move.&nbsp; Not &#8212; we&#8217;re not the only culture that has that view, but it was imbued in my family.</p>



<p>And the other one was that &#8212; and I mean this sincerely &#8212; my dad’s: “No one is better than you, and you&#8217;re no better than anyone else.”&nbsp; Not a joke.&nbsp; “No one is better than you, but you’re no better than anyone else.”&nbsp; And it&#8217;s real.&nbsp; It&#8217;s real.&nbsp; Because we were taught never &#8212; as my mother would say, “Never bow, never bend, never yield.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the truth of the matter was that in the days when my parents and grandparents were growing up in the coal country of Scranton, being Irish was less than a badge of honor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>My &#8212; my great grandfather Blewitt, my &#8212; on &#8212; my grandmother Finnegan’s maiden name &#8212; was only the second Catholic ever elected to the Senate in the state of &#8212; in the state of Pennsylvania.&nbsp; And that was 1907, and only the second one.&nbsp; The first one was in, I think, 1838 or 1840.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The point was that, like many cultures, like many folks, where you came from was either viewed as an asset or a liability.&nbsp; And where &#8212; you know, but the point is that everything that we were taught &#8212; and I&#8217;m sure all of you of Irish background, and other backgrounds as well, were taught that &#8212; that, you know, it&#8217;s all about striving for a better future; that you can do better &#8212; just simply do better. &nbsp;And, you know &#8212; and you can do it while you cherish the past. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, you don’t have to forget the past, or dis- &#8212; or disso- &#8212; disassociate yourself &#8212; yourself from it, but cherish it.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You know, these are the values of immigrants not only from Ireland, but from &#8212; like my great-great-grandparents when they were brought here &#8212; brought themselves to the United States.&nbsp; But today, it&#8217;s only part of what it means to be Irish.&nbsp; There is an indelible part of it that is American, because the values are the same, in my view &#8212; the values built into our Constitution that we are the &#8212;</p>



<p>I &#8212; I &#8212; you heard me say last night: I think we&#8217;re the most unique country in the history of the world.&nbsp; We&#8217;re the only country based upon &#8212; organizationally &#8212; not geography, not ethnicity, not &#8212; not race, not religion, but on a notion, an idea that we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men and women are created equal, endowed by their Creator, with certain inalienable rights: life, liberty.</p>



<p>I mean, that&#8217;s the basis of why we formed this country.&nbsp; No other country has ever been based on a notion like that.&nbsp; They&#8217;ve incorporated those notions, but the basis for their organization has been their ethnicity, their religion, their geography &#8212; whatever &#8212; but not here.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I know I say it, and many of you say &#8212; and I think people wonder whether we really mean it: I really think the source of our strength is our diversity.&nbsp; The source of our strength is our diversity.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, you know, there are values that immigrants from Ireland brought and &#8212; but they’re &#8212; as I said, they&#8217;re not only &#8212; they&#8217;re not only Irish values, they&#8217;re values, I think, of the vast majority of immigrants who come to the United States.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I&#8217;m proud to say that the bond between Ireland and the United States, by the way, has grown deeper and stronger over the years.&nbsp; For real.&nbsp; And we&#8217;ve navigated a once-in-a-century pandemic together.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve grieved the loss of too many people in both our countries.&nbsp; And we worked to rebuild our economies and taken on the challenge of renewing and strengthening our democracy, because &#8212; again, I apologize for repeating myself, but I know many of you’ve heard me say I think we&#8217;re at an inflection point in history.&nbsp; I think &#8212; and I mean that sincerely.&nbsp; And it occurs every several generations.&nbsp; I think we&#8217;re in a genuine struggle between autocracies and democracies, and whether or not democracies can be sustained.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I &#8212; I&#8217;m going to be speaking to President Xi tomorrow.&nbsp; And he&#8217;ll remind me that I told him &#8212; he remembers every damn thing I&#8217;ve said, unfortunately.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; But all kidding aside, we talk about the idea he &#8212; that he does not believe demo- &#8212; democracies can be sustained in the 21st century because things move so rapidly, technology is changing so much, democracies don&#8217;t have time to arrive at consensus.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why autocracies will succeed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Well, you know, and now &#8212; you know, we &#8212; you have Ireland stepping up not only in terms of the relationship with us but, you know, the Good Friday Agreement is built on political and economic progress that we&#8217;ve made together.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I know some criticize me, but I&#8217;ve &#8212; I&#8217;ve be- &#8212; I have a good relationship with the Prime Minister of Great Britain, Boris.&nbsp; We always kid each other when we see each other.&nbsp; But the point is that I&#8217;ve made it clear that &#8212; I don&#8217;t think I just speak for myself &#8212; the Good Friday Agreements are firmly, firmly, firmly, firmly supported here in the United States.&nbsp; And we insist that it occur, they be maintained because it’s (inaudible) too hard.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>The people of Northern Ireland have made significant changes as well.&nbsp; There&#8217;s movement, as you&#8217;ve mentioned &#8212; the young kids you talked about &#8212; Protestant and Catholic &#8212; talking to how &#8212; I mean, how they&#8217;ve never known anything but being able to get along.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I remember the first time I &#8212; on my parents’ 50th wedding anniversary, my brothers and sister, we got together and gave my &#8212; and we can work something out for you, Father &#8212; we gave my parents a &#8212; a trip to Ireland.&nbsp; And &#8212; but it coincided &#8212; I was going over to the Stormont talks.&nbsp; And so they said, “You take them, Joey.”&nbsp; (Laughs.)&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And &#8212; but the point is that it was &#8212; it was an &#8212; a bit of an epiphany for my parents.&nbsp; They thought &#8212; you hear all the stories from your ancestors about this, that, and the other thing &#8212; some of it apocryphal, some of it real.&nbsp; But it was &#8212; it was really amazing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But when we took them to the north, it was interesting.&nbsp; We went up to the Stormont and &#8212; anyway, they &#8212; it was an interesting thing to watch &#8212; to watch the look on my mother&#8217;s face and my father&#8217;s face as we toured Ireland, to see both the things that they had heard that were consistent with what they heard, because you never know whether they &#8212; you know, there&#8217;s exaggeration about, “Well, when &#8212; when this happened and that happened.”&nbsp; But they came back more hopeful than they had ever been as opposed to &#8212; and that was a while ago.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But my generic point is that, you know, now you have Ireland and Great Britain, and, you know, the Republic standing together against a murderous dictator, a pure thug, who is waging an immoral war against the people of Ukraine.</p>



<p>And, by the way, the Republic is paying a big price for this, a big number for supporting the strategy &#8212; for supporting the sanctions, including aircr- &#8212; a whole range of things.&nbsp; This &#8212; it’s not a minor contribution they’re making in this effort.&nbsp; It’s significant.</p>



<p>Ireland and the United States are working together.&nbsp; For the first time now, they&#8217;re on the United Nations Security Council.&nbsp; Ireland is a part of the Security Council now and the European Union.&nbsp; And Putin is paying a big price for his aggression.&nbsp; And &#8212; and they are part of the reason this cost is going so high.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s a little &#8212; you know, everybody talks about Germany having stepped up and changed the notions about being more &#8212; more leaning forward.&nbsp; But &#8212; and they have.&nbsp; Well, so is Ireland.&nbsp; So is Ireland &#8212; a neutral country.&nbsp; Ireland has stepped up and taking a hit for what they&#8217;re doing.</p>



<p>And you &#8212; look, you know, ladies and gentlemen, the relationship between Ireland and the United States is a dynamic and, I think, essential partnership that &#8212; as much as it&#8217;s ever been.&nbsp; And, you know, it&#8217;s sustained and strengthened by the Friends of Ireland, in this room and all across the country.&nbsp; And, you know, the connections that link our people stretch back through history, and they forward &#8212; well forward, I believe, in the future.</p>



<p>You know, we &#8212; we share a common goal: a future of a greater peace, greater hope, greater security, and a greater sense of who we are as countries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, you know, I &#8212; my &#8212; my mother&#8217;s expression, gotten from her grandfather, was, you know: As long as you&#8217;re alive, you have an obligation to strive.&nbsp; And you&#8217;re not dead until you’ve seen the face of God.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s what I think of when I think of Ireland.&nbsp; All the troubles they&#8217;ve been through, they have never, ever, ever quit.&nbsp; Never, ever, ever, ever quit &#8212; not once.&nbsp; They&#8217;ve gotten up.&nbsp; And now they&#8217;re beginning to at least have the benefits of all the hard work and labor they&#8217;ve engaged in, and they’re becoming a real actor, Mr. Ambassador, on the world stage and at the United Nations.</p>



<p>And so, I want to thank you, Mr. Ambassador, and I thank the Taoiseach today.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I &#8212; I just &#8212; I should &#8212; I should probably tell you that my mother, when I took &#8212; when we went to Ireland, and we were &#8212; we were in the south, and my father was a real gentleman.&nbsp; And his greatest regret was he never had a college education.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But if I were &#8212; if you or any one of you were coming back to Delaware with me and my dad were around or retired, and I didn&#8217;t call him to tell him I was bringing you over to introduce him so he had a chance to put on a coat and a tie &#8212; because he would only see you that way &#8212; that was my dad.</p>



<p>And as we were going to Ireland &#8212; FitzGerald was the Taoiseach &#8212; and we walked in to have a picture taken.&nbsp; And my dad had his brand-new blazer that had a &#8212; a patch on of&nbsp;my brother-in-law, Jack Owens &#8212; who&#8217;s Irish from &#8212; like you, Neal.&nbsp; And it was this patch &#8212; this crest.&nbsp; And it had Latin written on it.&nbsp; And I never took the time to look at it, although I had to take four years of Latin &#8212; three years of Latin in the Catholic high school I went to.</p>



<p>And Taoiseach &#8212; we’re having our picture taken, and he said, “Oh, Mr. Biden” &#8212; he said, “I agree.”&nbsp; And what it said in Latin was, “Don&#8217;t let the bastards get you down.”&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Well, we can&#8217;t let them get us down.&nbsp; You can&#8217;t let them get us down.</p>



<p>Thank you for allowing me to come back home, come up here and speak.&nbsp; And thank you, Nancy, for the nice compliments.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>SPEAKER PELOSI:&nbsp; As the President has to make a clean exit to go back to work, I wanted all of us to lift our glass to toast the President on this St. Patrick&#8217;s Day.</p>



<p>Mr. President, this is a toast that I learned from my grandchildren; I&#8217;ve said it to our colleagues here before.&nbsp; And it goes like this.&nbsp; It&#8217;s an Irish toast:&nbsp; Sing as is if no one can hear you.&nbsp; Dance as if no one can see you.&nbsp; Love as if you&#8217;ve loved &#8212; never loved before.&nbsp; And live as if heaven is on Earth.</p>



<p>So when I said to them, “Is that a toast that is a tradition in the Kenneally family?” they say, “No, that&#8217;s a sign that is in the Shannon Airport.”&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>To the President.&nbsp; Happy &#8212;</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>SPEAKER PELOSI:&nbsp; Thank you, Mr. President.&nbsp; Happy St. Patrick’s Day.</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Well, my grandmother had one.&nbsp; She said, “May those who love us, love us.&nbsp; And those who don&#8217;t, may they turn their ankle so we know they&#8217;re coming by their limp.”&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;</p>

<p>President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. met virtually today with Taoiseach Micheál Martin of Ireland, upholding a longstanding White House tradition on St. Patrick’s Day that symbolizes the deep ties and historic partnership between our countries. The President expressed regret that he and the Taoiseach were unable to meet in person and wished him a speedy recovery. The leaders discussed the coordinated international response to Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified war in Ukraine, including the imposition of significant economic costs on Russia and the provision of humanitarian assistance to the people of Ukraine who are displaced by the conflict. They welcomed the growing trade and investment ties between our countries, as well as our close cooperation on shared global challenges, including through the United Nations Security Council. &nbsp;The leaders also underscored their enduring commitment to the Good Friday Agreement (also known as the Belfast Agreement) and the importance of preserving political and economic stability in Northern Ireland.</p>



<p>After the bilateral meeting, the President attended the traditional St. Patrick’s Day Speaker’s Lunch on Capitol Hill, hosted by Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi. In the evening, the President and the First Lady will host at the White House the presentation of the shamrocks, a gesture of friendship and goodwill between the United States and Ireland that dates back to 1952.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Via Teleconference</p>



<p>11:22 A.M. EDT</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PRESIDENT BIDEN:&nbsp; Well, Taoiseach, I&#8217;m really deeply sorry you &#8212; for the inconvenience that we’re having to meet virtually again this year, although I did, at a little distance, for seven and a half minutes get to see you yesterday, but &#8212; and your beautiful wife.&nbsp; But &#8212; and especially after your flying all the way here to Washington and with a lot going on up in the Hill and the rest.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But just as we did last year, the tradition of this beautiful bowl, the tradition of these beautiful shamrocks I have here with me.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And we&#8217;re meeting in a moment when demands on unity in the world are really accelerating.&nbsp; And we have to be united, and we certainly are.&nbsp; And &#8212; but I &#8212; Putin&#8217;s brutality and what he&#8217;s doing and his troops are doing in Ukraine is just inhumane.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And so, you know &#8212; as you know, your predecessor and you occasionally kid me about always quoting Irish poets.&nbsp; But &#8212; but Yeats had a great line in “Easter Sunday, 1919” [sic].&nbsp; He said, “All has changed, changed utterly: A terrible beauty has been born.”&nbsp; He was talking about his Ireland and what was going to come, which had turned out to be better than &#8212; than worse.<br>&nbsp;<br>But all has changed.&nbsp; I think that your leadership on the global stage has really been noticeable and impressive.&nbsp; You&#8217;re now a member of &#8212; temporarily for the &#8212; as you are a member of the Security Council.&nbsp; Your leadership on the global stage within the EU as well. &nbsp;And &#8212; and your condemnation of Putin&#8217;s aggression and support of the &#8212; of the sanctions.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s costing Ireland.&nbsp; It’s costing Ireland.&nbsp; But as usual, you&#8217;re basing it on principle and moral standing of the country.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And &#8212; but I also want to emphasize this administration&#8217;s unequivocal support for the Good Friday accords &#8212; for the Good Friday Agreement.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve made that clear, as you probably heard, to the Prime Minister and others: I think it&#8217;s &#8212; too much blood, sweat, and tears have been shed to get that done.&nbsp; And this is no time to change it.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And we have a full agenda to discuss, I know.&nbsp; And &#8212; but deepening our cooperation &#8212; Ireland and the United States &#8212; bilaterally and through the European Union is &#8212; is &#8212; and taking on climate change, looking at economic opportunities we both have, and combating COVID combined is something that we&#8217;re going to work closely together on.<br>&nbsp;<br>We have a lot to talk about, but I&#8217;m talking too much.&nbsp; Let me yield the floor to you, Taoiseach.&nbsp; And &#8212; and you have my best wishes for &#8212; I know you&#8217;re looking good, feeling good, but I&#8217;m looking forward to you getting cleared as quickly as you can.<br>&nbsp;<br>PRIME MINISTER MARTIN:&nbsp; Well, thank you very much indeed, President.&nbsp; And last year, we met virtually across the Atlantic.&nbsp; This year, we&#8217;re meeting virtually across the road.&nbsp; (Laughs.)&nbsp; So, we&#8217;re getting closer.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>But I&#8217;m feeling good.&nbsp; And I think that reminds us of the importance of vaccines, and &#8212; because vaccines prevent severe illness.&nbsp; And it reminds us of that can- &#8212; central message we give to people: Get vaccinated if you&#8217;re not vaccinated.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, of course, it is unfortunate, but it&#8217;s no more than that.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I share with you our horror at the barbaric attack on the civilians of Ukraine.&nbsp; And I want to take this opportunity to genuinely salute your leadership &#8212; it&#8217;s firm, it&#8217;s determined, it&#8217;s strong, it&#8217;s measured in the teeth of this crisis &#8212; and, particularly, your capacity to marshal like-minded democracies.&nbsp; The U.S., the European Union, the United Kingdom, the other &#8212; Canada, and other like-minded democracies are coming together to respond in an unprecedented way to this barbaric attack on the women and children of Ukraine.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our thoughts are with them and all the young people who are dying because of this unjustifiable and immoral war on their people by the regime of Vladimir Putin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I think it&#8217;s extremely important that we keep this unity of purpose over the coming while.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And Ireland stands ready to do everything we possibly can on the humanitarian front and in supporting the broadest and widest sanctions possible to keep the pressure on and to get this war ended, because there&#8217;s simply too much suffering.&nbsp; And it’s heartrending to see the appalling loss of life and also the terrible trauma on the children of Ukraine and their mothers as they flee this war zone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And we&#8217;re very seized by this in Ireland.&nbsp; And the response has been &#8212; has been great to behold, in terms of the people of Ireland who want to do everything they possibly can here.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May I also just thank you again, in respect of the Good Friday Agreement, your steadfast support, and that of Speaker Pelosi and our friends on the Hill, in giving a very clear message in respect of how important the Good Friday Agreement is in respect of &#8212; of stability and peace on the island of Ireland.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And over the vast number of days, as I&#8217;ve been here, we&#8217;ve also witnessed once again that two-way, very robust economic relationship between the United States and &#8212; and Ireland.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a two-way relationship.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I met Irish companies yesterday who are creating 100,000 jobs in the U.S. now.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s because of that partnership between Ireland, Europe, and the U.S.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I look forward to discussing these issues in greater detail.&nbsp; But, again, to say that it&#8217;s wonderful to meet with you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And we met in Glasgow recently.&nbsp; We had a good chinwag there, in respect of a number of issues.&nbsp; But, again, that &#8212; that also illustrated that partnership between Europe and the U.S. in terms of the existential crisis of our time &#8212; climate change.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, great to have this opportunity to meet with you, President.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PRESIDENT BIDEN:&nbsp; I want to say one thing while the press is here before they leave, and that is: What Ireland is doing now, what you are doing, taking in Ukrainian refugees, speaks so loudly about your principles.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s amazing, and I want to publicly compliment you for it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think you&#8217;ve already brought in over 7,000 or so refugees from Ukraine, and you&#8217;re prepared to do more.&nbsp; So you’ve &#8212; thank you.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; I just want to make sure everybody knows that.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PRIME MINISTER MARTIN:&nbsp; It’s our duty.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>Earlier this month, the Biden-Harris Administration released the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/covidplan/">National COVID-19 Preparedness Plan</a>, a roadmap to move the country forward safely and continue to fight COVID-19 as Americans get back to their more normal routines. &nbsp;Today the Administration is launching the Clean Air in Buildings Challenge, a key component of the President’s Plan, that calls on all building owners and operators, schools, colleges and universities, and organizations of all kinds to adopt key strategies to improve indoor air quality in their buildings and reduce the spread of COVID-19.&nbsp;<br><br>The Clean Air in Buildings Challenge is a call to action for leaders and building owners and operators of all types to assess their indoor air quality and make ventilation and air filtration improvements to help keep occupants safe. As part of the Challenge, today, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published a best practices guide for improving indoor air quality and reducing the risk of spreading dangerous airborne particles. <a href="https://www.epa.gov/indoor-air-quality-iaq/clean-air-buildings-challenge" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">This guide</a>&nbsp;– developed in collaboration with the Department of Energy, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and other federal agencies – contains a set of clear recommendations organized into four groups:</p>



<ol><li><em>Create a clean indoor air action plan</em> that assesses indoor air quality, plans for upgrades and improvements, and includes HVAC inspections and maintenance.</li><li><em>Optimize fresh air ventilation</em> by bringing in and circulating clean outdoor air indoors.</li><li><em>Enhance air filtration and cleaning</em> using the central HVAC system and in-room air cleaning devices.</li><li><em>Engage the building community</em> by communicating with building occupants to increase awareness, commitment, and participation.</li></ol>



<p>Under each of these recommendation areas, EPA’s best practices guide lays out clear-cut actions building owners and operators can implement. The best practices guide is designed to serve as a menu of improvements to choose from. The guide includes quick steps that all organizations can take right away as a starting place, as well as resources to help plan for longer-term investments and improvements.&nbsp;<br><br>The Biden Administration and Congress have provided hundreds of billions of dollars in federal funds that can be used in schools, public buildings, and other settings to improve indoor air quality. The American Rescue Plan provided <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/coronavirus/assistance-for-state-local-and-tribal-governments/state-and-local-fiscal-recovery-funds">$350 billion for state and local governments</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.ed.gov/improving-ventilation-schools-colleges-and-universities-prevent-covid-19">$122 billion for schools</a>, that can be used to support making ventilation and filtration upgrades. These American Rescue Plan dollars are being put to work in communities around the country in improving Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems. Funding within the State and Local Fiscal Recovery Fund program and the Elementary and Secondary School Education Relief program can be spent on inspection, testing, and maintenance of current ventilation systems; purchasing portable air filtration units, with HEPA air filters; purchasing MERV-13 (or higher) filters for HVAC system and air conditioners; purchasing fans; repairing windows and/or doors; servicing, upgrading, or replacing HVAC systems consistent with industry standards; and more.<br><br>As detailed in the National COVID-19 Preparedness Plan, the Administration will continue to advance indoor air quality in buildings in additional ways, including:</p>



<ul><li>Supporting state, local, and Tribal governments as well as school districts to make ventilation improvements and upgrades using American Rescue Plan (ARP) and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funds.&nbsp; The Administration will work closely with public sector partners like schools to provide guidance and technical assistance to make these improvements and connect them to agency resources on indoor air quality.<br></li><li>Building public awareness around ventilation and filtration improvements to reduce disease spread in buildings. The Administration will build public awareness and communicate with the public on how ventilation and good indoor air quality are key factors in keeping Americans safe while inside buildings. The Administration will launch efforts to explain what good ventilation and air filtration look like as an important component of helping to reduce disease spread, and how buildings of any kind can pursue improvements to their ventilation and air filtration strategies.<br></li><li>Highlighting actions taken by buildings to achieve clean, healthy air quality through a recognition program. While the Administration invites all buildings to take actions from the Clean Air in Buildings Challenge, the Administration will also foster ways to recognize steps taken by buildings to improve indoor air quality and protect their communities. Similar to how programs like LEED, Fitwel, and WELL recognize buildings for their environmental and health impacts, this new effort between the federal government and external experts will develop ways to recognize steps taken by building owners for the health and safety of their communities and their achievements in improving air filtration and ventilation systems to protect and promote public health.<br></li><li>Catalyzing science and technology innovation to reduce indoor disease transmission. The Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), in coordination with other partners through the Pandemic Innovation Task Force, is identifying opportunities to drive innovation and implementation of technologies to support clean indoor air in buildings and reduce disease transmission. OSTP will also host a series of public engagements to provide the latest science, tools, and best practices on improving indoor air quality.</li></ul>

<p>I called on Jeff Zients to lead my Administration’s COVID-19 response because there is no one better at delivering results than Jeff.</p>



<p>COVID-19 is the greatest public health crisis we’ve faced in my lifetime and it required the country to build from scratch an emergency response infrastructure that could quickly and equitably get people life-saving protections. Jeff put his decades of management experience to work formulating and executing on a plan to build the infrastructure we needed to deliver vaccines, tests, treatment, and masks to hundreds of millions of Americans.</p>



<p>When Jeff took this job, less than 1% of Americans were fully vaccinated; fewer than half our schools were open; and unlike much of the developed world, America lacked any at-home COVID tests.&nbsp; Today, almost 80% of adults are fully vaccinated; over 100 million are boosted; virtually every school is open; and hundreds of millions of at-home tests are distributed every month.&nbsp; In addition, the US leads the global effort to fight COVID, delivering more free vaccines to other countries than every other nation on Earth. &nbsp;The progress that he and his team have made is stunning and even more important consequential.&nbsp;Lives have been saved.</p>



<p>Jeff spent the last 14 months working tirelessly to help combat COVID.&nbsp; He is a man of service and an expert manager. I will miss his counsel and I’m grateful for his service.</p>



<p>Thanks to all the progress we’ve made, Americans are safely moving back to more normal routines, using the effective new tools we have to enable us to reduce severe COVID cases and make workplaces and schools safer.&nbsp; But our work in combatting COVID is far from done.&nbsp;&nbsp; We must continue the effort to provide more vaccines and boosters.&nbsp; We must get a vaccine approved for the youngest children.&nbsp; We must continue to improve how our schools and workplaces cope with COVID.&nbsp; We must take special care to protect the vulnerable from COVID, even as many restrictions are lifted.&nbsp; We need to provide tests, and treatments, and masks.&nbsp; We must fight the virus overseas, prepare for new waves, and new variants – all of which can be coming.&nbsp; And we must work with Congress to fund these vital steps, as time is running out to stay ahead of the virus.</p>



<p>To lead this effort, I am excited to name Dr. Ashish Jha as the new White House COVID-19 Response Coordinator. Dr. Jha is one of the leading public health experts in America, and a well known figure to many Americans from his wise and calming public presence. And as we enter a new moment in the pandemic – executing on my National COVID-19 Preparedness Plan and managing the ongoing risks from COVID – Dr. Jha is the perfect person for the job.</p>



<p>I appreciate both Jeff and Dr. Jha for working closely to ensure a smooth transition, and I look forward to continued progress in the months ahead.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">National Building Museum<br>Washington, D.C.</p>



<p>7:39 P.M. EDT<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Hello, hello, hello.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Thank you, thank you, thank you.&nbsp; Thank you, thank you, thank you.&nbsp; Really.&nbsp; Please.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Please. &nbsp;Thank you very much.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Caitriona, thank you for that introduction.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s good to be back at this wonderful event to see so many friends &#8212; from members of Congress to leaders of faith, business, philanthropy, and the arts and the sciences.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>I&#8217;ve &#8212; to everyone at the Ireland Funds: Thank you for deepening the ties of the Irish diaspora throughout the world. Your work proves that the Irish are home everywhere &#8212; everywhere.&nbsp; And as &#8212; Taoiseach and Mrs. Martin I hope feel at home here in America.&nbsp; It&#8217;s an honor to welcome you back, Taoiseach.&nbsp; (Applause.) &nbsp;It’s an honor to welcome you back.&nbsp;<br><br>In 2009, at the White House Shamrock Ceremony, when you were foreign minister and I was vice president.&nbsp; The following year, my wife Jill and I were honored to host you both at the &#8212; at the Naval Observatory at a St. Patrick&#8217;s Day breakfast.&nbsp; And I look forward to continuing our friendship and discussing our partnership tomorrow at the White House when we both have come full circle.&nbsp; You&#8217;re Taoiseach and I&#8217;m President; what the hell are we going to do?&nbsp; (Laughter and applause.) &nbsp;Well, it’s &#8212; it’d be pretty personal for me.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>It’s been 165 years, like many of you &#8212; 165 years since my great-great-grandparents left County Mayo and County Louth aboard coffin ships to cross the Atlantic.&nbsp; Not sure all what &#8212; they knew what they were leaving.&nbsp; They weren&#8217;t sure what they were going to be seeing.&nbsp;<br><br>The Blewitts and the Finnegans eventually settled in Scranton, Pennsylvania.&nbsp; And &#8212; and that&#8217;s where my parents met and were married.&nbsp; It was where my mother, Catherine Eugenia Finnegan Biden, was born and later met &#8212; married my father, Joseph R. Biden, Sr.&nbsp; He has &#8212; he had the saving grace, on his mother&#8217;s side, of having a Hanafee from Galway.&nbsp; That&#8217;s the only thing that saved him.&nbsp; And you all think I&#8217;m kidding.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not.&nbsp; (Laughter.) &nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>And it was in Scranton where I was born, and I inherited my mother&#8217;s side of the family&#8217;s overwhelming pride &#8212; overwhelming pride in being Irish &#8212; a pride that spoke to both continents’ heart and soul, and drew from the old and the new.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>One of my great-great-uncles wrote his “Amerikay” letter back to his loved ones in Ireland, yearning to be home.&nbsp; And he said &#8212; he wrote, “If the road was made of furze…” &#8212; which is a yellow flower with thorns &#8212; he said, “If a road were made of furze from America to Ireland, I&#8217;d walk it in my bare feet.”&nbsp;<br><br>My great-grandfather, Edward Francis Blewitt, was only the second Catholic in the history of the state of Pennsylvania to be elected to the State Senate at that time in 1906 &#8212; at a time when many Catholics weren&#8217;t elected to office, especially coming out of the coal mine regions of Scranton.<br><br>You know, we had a &#8212; he had an engineering degree from Lafayette College and the heart of an Irish poet.&nbsp; In 1919, one of his over 100 poems that he wrote &#8212; and thankfully my uncle left them to me &#8212; he wrote of “his Ireland.”&nbsp; And the concluding stanza he wrote was:&nbsp;<br><br><em>“From the fairest land, except my own,</em><br><em>‘Neath stars and moon and sun,</em><br><em>a citadel of liberty,</em><br><em>My mother&#8217;s land, a rún.”</em><br><br>A lot has happened since his “mother&#8217;s land,&nbsp;<em>a rún</em>.”&nbsp; Things are so much better in Ireland today.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Like so many Americans, that pride has been passed down in every generation of our family.&nbsp; And I might add, my family &#8212; I don&#8217;t know where they&#8217;re sitting &#8212; my brother Jimmy; his wife, Sara; and my niece, Missy.&nbsp; Where are you guys?&nbsp; They&#8217;re here.&nbsp; What table are you at?&nbsp; (Applause.) &nbsp;There you go.&nbsp;<br><br>Unfortunately for Jimmy, we&#8217;re often mistaken as the same person.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Early on when I was Vice President &#8212; true story &#8212; there was a threat as I was driving from &#8212; from the Vice President’s Residence to the White House, to work.&nbsp; And they suggested that Jimmy ride in the front limousine.&nbsp; (Laughter.) &nbsp;You&#8217;re a hell of a brother, Jim.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; You&#8217;re a hell of a brother.&nbsp;<br><br>As a matter of fact, Taoiseach, Micheál &#8212; I &#8212; when I was Vice President, I hosted one of your predecessors, Enda Kenny, who I got to know in the Naval Observatory.&nbsp; I&#8217;d always have a St. Patrick&#8217;s Day breakfast.&nbsp; And afterwards, I took him to the Oval Office to meet with Barack, which was the usual deal, which will &#8212; and he turned to Barack after &#8212; I think it was the fifth year or sixth year in.&nbsp; And he turned to Barack and said, “God, Barack, let the boy come home.&nbsp; Send him home, will you?”&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; And Barack said, “Get the hell home to Ireland.”&nbsp;<br><br>I’d been to Ireland many times but never to make a connection with my heritage and my family.&nbsp; In fact, six years ago, three generations of my family walked along Garden Street in Ballina, in County Mayo, like our ferbea- &#8212; our forebears, the Blewitts, did.&nbsp; We visited a church in County Louth, where the Finnegans were baptized, at Cooley Peninsula, down at the tip near Carlingford, where they made their living in both the land and the sea.&nbsp; And we also went to Lily Finnegan’s pub &#8212; (laughter) &#8212; for spirits and to meet some of my distant relatives.<br><br>(Audience member whistles.)&nbsp; (Laughter.)<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; You know it.<br><br>And I got to speak to the Irish people at Dublin Castle and thought about my Grandpa Finnegan.&nbsp; We also visited Trinity College.&nbsp; And my Grandpa Finnegan was a student of Irish history &#8212; a magnificent place &#8212; but he always would point out to me Trinity College was built to wipe out Catholicism in the island.&nbsp;<br><br>And so, I had the great honor of being &#8212; being given an honorary degree &#8212; an honorary doctorate degree.&nbsp; And I spoke to the graduating class at a magnificent place, and I must admit I started &#8212; I said, “Grandpa Finnegan, forgive me but it&#8217;s no longer &#8212; no longer a mortal sin.&nbsp; It&#8217;s okay.”&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; And I received the honorary doctorate so I could catch up with my wife, Dr. Jill Biden.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br><br>And a great and unexpected honor: I was inducted into the University Philosophic Society, the oldest one in the world.&nbsp; And that night, the Ireland Fund &#8212; you guys hosted the dinner for my family in Ireland.&nbsp; And &#8212; and I just want to thank you.&nbsp; A hundred thousand welcomes.&nbsp; I never pronounce it correctly, but it&#8217;s<em>Céad míle</em>&nbsp;&#8212; I got to remember it now &#8212;<em>Céad míle fáilte</em>.&nbsp; Is that right?<br><br>AUDIENCE MEMBER:&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Céad míle fáilte</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Fáilte</em>.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; A hundred thousand welcomes.&nbsp; I have trouble speaking Gaelic and English.&nbsp; (Laughter.)<br><br>But it was a trip I’ll always remember.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even made &#8212; it even made clear what my mother imbued in her children and her grandchildren: an absolute certitude that we were equal to every person, and every person was equal to us.&nbsp; That was my mom &#8212; the Speaker has heard me say this before.&nbsp; My mom would say, “Remember, nobody is better than you.&nbsp; And everyone is your equal.”&nbsp; That everyone deserved to be treated with a word, I think, the Irish use more than any other group of people &#8212; treated with “dignity.”&nbsp; Dignity.<br><br>My father would no more walk by the Chairman of the Board of the DuPont Company or the shoeshine guy in the DuPont Hotel without saying “hello” to both.&nbsp;<br><br>It’s a certitude built on both our nations that we’ve always shared a deep spark.&nbsp; Everything between us runs deep &#8212; the literature, the poetry, the sadness, the joy, but, most of all, our resilience.&nbsp; Despite everything, we’ve never stopped being dreamers.&nbsp; And I think we Irish are the only people in the world who actually are nostalgic for the future.&nbsp; (Laughter.)<br><br>Think about it.&nbsp; You think I’m kidding.&nbsp; Think about it.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br><br>But, of course, that means dealing with the present.&nbsp; At this time, in our time, we’ve seen more change and challenge, I believe, than any time in generations.&nbsp; A once-in-a-century pandemic.&nbsp; An economic unease and anxiety.&nbsp; An existential threat of the climate crisis.&nbsp; And what we see today in Ukraine: an unprovoked war of aggression and just a vicious, vicious, vicious treatment of the Ukrainian people &#8212; bombing hospitals and homes and nurseries.&nbsp;<br><br>A march of reactionary forces of nationalism, nativism, and isolationism; of autocracies, not just in Europe &#8212; we’ve see it around the world; we’ve seen it here in America.<br><br>But I also see this: the strength, necessity, and endurance of democracy.&nbsp; That we, the people &#8212; we’re the most unique nation in the world because of our backgrounds.&nbsp; We’re the only nation built on the notion of an idea &#8212; not ethnicity, not geography, but an idea that we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men and women are created equal, endowed by their Creator.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; I really mean it.&nbsp;<br><br>We’ve never lived up to it completely, but we have never walked away from it.&nbsp; Wa- &#8212; opportunity, the rule of law of equal rights and dignity for everybody.<br><br>And while terrible things have happened on both sides of our shores &#8212; violence, civil unrest, racial and religious discrimination &#8212; we’re nations and a people that are self-reflective and self-corrective.&nbsp; Nations where hope runs deep and optimism reigns.&nbsp; Optimism that’s brave and digs deep.<br><br>My mother used to have an expression &#8212; for real. &nbsp;She’d say, “Joe, remember: As long as you’re alive, you have an obligation to strive.&nbsp; And you’re not dead until you’ve seen the face of God.”&nbsp; That was her anthem.&nbsp; And I can tell you, every one of my siblings and cousins &#8212; it was beat into our heads.&nbsp;<br><br>That’s what I see in the Republic of Ireland today &#8212; a global force in culture and in the arts; leaders on the world stage; members of the United Nations Security Council; a country with a past that tugs at our hearts and a future that’s going to shape the world.<br><br>Eavan Boland, the late Irish poet, who fought &#8212; who taught here in America at Stanford University, she wrote of today’s Republic of Ireland.&nbsp; She said:<br><br><em>“Our island that was once</em><br><em>Settled and removed on the edge</em><br><em>Of Europe is now [the] bridge</em><br><em>To the world.”&nbsp;</em><br><br>It has that capacity.&nbsp;<br><br>Tonight, let us salute that bridge to the world.&nbsp; A bridge that for generations has gone back and forth between Ireland and the United States, and that grows stronger and more necessary as every year passes.&nbsp; And I mean it.&nbsp; I mean it.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>We feel it across America, especially during the week of St. Patrick’s Day in cities and towns big and small.<br><br>And the White House tomorrow will be decked in green.&nbsp; And I’ll also be thinking about the Friendly Sons of St. Patrick’s Day event in Scranton and Lackawanna County, which my great grandfather helped found &#8212; where it started for my family here in America.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>I’ll be thinking about the annual morning mass at St. Patrick’s Church in Wilmington, Delaware, where my son Beau and my son Hunter were members.&nbsp; And we called it St. Patrick’s Day Society that supported the church and community.&nbsp; The society was started in 1990 by a dear friend, late Father Jim Trainor, who gathered a group of friends in a tough neighborhood.&nbsp; It used to be an all Irish neighborhood back at the turn of the 18- &#8212; excuse me &#8212; in the turn of the 20th century, but it’s now a minority neighborhood; it’s in trouble.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>And in his home &#8212; he’d invite us &#8212; we found a way to ground a day of celebration with a greater sense of purpose.&nbsp; And we built a sense of community to restore hope in those struggling, to thread that common bonds of respect, dignity, and love for &#8212; among all people, in every station.<br><br>Over the years, our St. Patrick’s Day Society in Wilmington, Delaware, has raised millions of dollars, like you have done &#8212; and so much more &#8212; for countless people of all backgrounds in the community.&nbsp;<br><br>It all started with an idea &#8212; with a spark of passion and compassion. &nbsp;And it grew and grew ever since.&nbsp; A proud tradition of my hometown that reflects the souls of two great nations, and providing that when you’re Irish &#8212; proving it when you’re Irish, when you’re American: Home is everywhere.&nbsp; What a gift.&nbsp; What a blessing.<br><br>Let me close with this: By the time my great-great-grandfather Owen Finnegan, a shoemaker, boarded a coffin ship in 1844, another shoemaker named Joseph Kearny from Moneygo- &#8212; excuse me &#8212; from Moneygall &#8212; ship &#8212; on another ship, five weeks before &#8212; he was President Obama’s great-great-grandfather.&nbsp; There’s a good chance they knew each other, I’m told when I was in Ireland, because they were both &#8212; there were both shoemakers.&nbsp; And they left everything behind for an uncertain future.<br><br>But I wonder, in all their dreams, whether they could have ever dreamt that each of their grandsons would one day be President of the United States of America.&nbsp; That’s America.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp; That’s America.&nbsp; Or as my grandfather Ambrose Finnegan would say, “That’s the Irish of it.”&nbsp; (Laughter.)<br><br>And now it’s up to all of us to keep the sense of possibility for every person who gives up everything in search of a better life.&nbsp; That’s been our history.&nbsp; It’s our present.&nbsp; And if we&#8217;re lucky, it will be our future.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>A thousand thanks to all of you.&nbsp; One night in advance: Happy St. Patrick’s Day.&nbsp;<br><br>May God bless you all.&nbsp; And may God protect our troops.&nbsp;<br><br>Thank you so very much.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>7:55 P.M. EDT</p>
