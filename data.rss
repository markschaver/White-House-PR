<p>President Yoon Suk Yeol welcomes President Joseph R. Biden to the Republic of Korea (ROK), marking the earliest meeting in a ROK President’s term in office with the President of the United States (U.S.). Founded in our shared sacrifice and honed by our deep security ties, the Alliance between the Republic of Korea and the United States continues to evolve and expand. The linchpin for peace and prosperity in the region, the Alliance has grown far beyond the Korean peninsula, reflecting the pivotal role of our countries as global leaders in democracy, economy, and technology. Faced with existential challenges like climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic, and growing threats to the rules-based international order, foremost among which is Russia’s further aggression against Ukraine, the Republic of Korea and the United States are unified in common determination to deepen and broaden our political, economic, security, and people-to-people ties.</p>



<p>The two Presidents deeply appreciate the recent accomplishments of the Alliance and pledge to continue building off of its rock solid foundation.</p>



<p><strong>The Linchpin for Peace and Prosperity</strong></p>



<p>President Yoon and President Biden reaffirm their mutual commitment to the defense of the Republic of Korea and the combined defense posture under the ROK-U.S. Mutual Defense Treaty. President Biden affirms the U.S. extended deterrence commitment to the ROK using the full range of U.S. defense capabilities, including nuclear, conventional, and missile defense capabilities. The two Presidents also agree to reactivate the high-level Extended Deterrence Strategy and Consultation Group at the earliest date. Both leaders commit to further strengthen deterrence by reinforcing combined defense posture, and reiterate commitment to a conditions-based transition of wartime operational control. With this in mind, and considering the evolving threat posed by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK), both leaders agree to initiate discussions to expand the scope and scale of combined military exercises and training on and around the Korean Peninsula. Both leaders also reaffirm the commitment of the U.S. to deploy strategic U.S. military assets in a timely and coordinated manner as necessary, as well as to enhance such measures and identify new or additional steps to reinforce deterrence in the face of DPRK destabilizing activities. In this vein, the United States and ROK will significantly expand cooperation to confront a range of cyber threats from the DPRK, including but not limited to, state-sponsored cyber-attacks.</p>



<p>President Yoon and President Biden reiterate their common goal of the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and agree to further strengthen the airtight coordination to this end. The two Presidents share the view that the DPRK’s nuclear program presents a grave threat not only to peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula but also the rest of Asia and the world. Both leaders condemn the DPRK’s escalatory ballistic missile tests this year, including multiple launches of intercontinental ballistic missiles, as clear violations of United Nations Security Council resolutions and reaffirm their joint commitment to work with the international community to urge the DPRK to abandon its weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs.Both leaders urge all UN Member States to fully implement all United Nations Security Council resolutions and also call on the DPRK to abide by its obligations under UN Security Council resolutions as well as its previous commitments and agreements.</p>



<p>President Yoon and President Biden emphasize that the path to dialogue remains open toward peaceful and diplomatic resolution with the DPRK and call on DPRK to return to negotiations. President Yoon outlined his vision to normalize inter-Korean relationship through an audacious plan aimed at a denuclearized and prosperous Korean peninsula and President Biden expresses his support for inter-Korean cooperation. Both leaders underscore the importance of ROK-U.S.-Japan trilateral cooperation for responding to the DPRK’s challenges, protecting shared security and prosperity, upholding common values, and bolstering the rules-based international order.</p>



<p>President Yoon and President Biden express grave concern over the human rights situation in the DPRK. The two Presidents also reaffirm their commitment to facilitate the provision of humanitarian aid to the most vulnerable North Koreans. Both leaders express concern over the recent COVID-19 outbreak in the DPRK. The ROK and the U.S. are willing to work with the international community to provide assistance to the DPRK to combat the virus.</p>



<p><strong>A Strategic Economic and Technology Partnership</strong></p>



<p>President Yoon and President Biden recognize that the future of the Alliance will be defined by common efforts to address 21<sup>st</sup> century challenges. In this vein, the two Presidents pledge to deepen and broaden cooperation on critical and emerging technologies, and cyber security. Both leaders also pledge to develop, use, and advance technologies in line with shared democratic principles and universal values.</p>



<p>President Yoon and President Biden recognize the importance of deepening cooperation on economic and energy security, which are critical to safeguarding our prosperity, shared security, and collective interests. To support these initiatives, the two Presidents will direct respective National Security Councils to launch an economic security dialogue aimed to align the bureaucratic and policy approaches between the two governments.</p>



<p>Fully recognizing that scientists, researchers, and engineers of the ROK and the U.S. are among the most innovative in the world, the two Presidents agree to leverage this comparative advantage to enhance public and private cooperation to protect and promote critical and emerging technologies, including leading-edge semiconductors, eco-friendly EV batteries, Artificial Intelligence, quantum technology, biotechnology, biomanufacturing, and autonomous robotics. Moreover, the two Presidents also reaffirm their active support for people-to-people exchanges between experts in these fields. To this end, the two Presidents agree to work together to enhance partnership on these critical and emerging technologies in both countries through the promotion of investment as well as research and development cooperation. Recognizing the growing potential for ROK-U.S. cooperation in the defense industry, the two leaders agree to strengthen partnerships in areas such as defense sector supply chain, joint development and manufacturing, including beginning discussions on a Reciprocal Defense Procurement agreement.</p>



<p>Secure, sustainable, and resilient global supply chains are foundational to these efforts. Building upon international cooperation fostered by the U.S.-led Summit on Global Supply Chain Resilience, and by working closely together in the upcoming Ministerial-level summit, the two Presidents agree to continue working together to tackle immediate and long-term challenges in the supply chain ecosystem. Both leaders agree to strengthen the resiliency and diversity of these networks including by cooperating on early warning systems to detect and address potential supply chain disruptions and working together to address sourcing and processing of critical minerals. The two Presidents also agree to establish a regular ministerial-level Supply Chain and Commercial Dialogue to discuss promotion of resilient supply chains of key products, including semiconductors, batteries, and critical minerals. Both leaders also agree to enhance cooperation between our foreign investment screening and export control authorities related to critical technologies, which is necessary to prevent the use of advanced technologies to undermine our national and economic security.</p>



<p>Recognizing the importance of energy security as well as commitment to address climate change given the rapid increase of volatility in the global energy market as a result of Russia’s further aggression against Ukraine, the two Presidents will work to strengthen joint collaboration in securing energy supply chains that include fossil fuels, and enriched uranium, acknowledging that true energy security means rapidly deploying clean energy technology and working to decrease our dependence on fossil fuels.</p>



<p>The two leaders recognize the importance of nuclear energy as a critical and reliable source of carbon-free electricity, an important element to grow our clean energy economy, and an integral part of enhancing global energy security. The two leaders commit to greater nuclear energy collaboration and accelerating the development and global deployment of advanced reactors and small modular reactors by jointly using export promotion and capacity building tools, and building a more resilient nuclear supply chain. The two Presidents reaffirm that both countries will engage in global civil-nuclear cooperation in accordance with the highest standards of nuclear nonproliferation, including the IAEA Additional Protocol as the standard for both international safeguards and for nuclear supply arrangements. Acknowledging the shared goals of deepening strategic ties, while respecting each country’s intellectual investments, both leaders commit to using tools such as the ROK-U.S. Memorandum of Understanding on Nuclear Technology Transfer and Export Cooperation to provide a solid foundation for strengthened cooperation in the U.S., ROK and overseas nuclear markets and the High-Level Bilateral Commission, to further cooperation for spent fuel management, nuclear export promotion, assured fuel supply and nuclear security. The U.S. welcomes the ROK’s decision to join the U.S.-led Foundational Infrastructure for Responsible Use of Small Modular Reactor Technology (FIRST) program.</p>



<p>President Yoon and President Biden commit to strengthening the ROK-U.S. alliance across all sectors of space cooperation. Building on the ROK’s previous commitment to participate in the Artemis program, the two Presidents agreed to foster joint research in space exploration and to support the ROK’s development of the Korean Positioning System (KPS). Both leaders agree to hold “the 3<sup>rd</sup> U.S.-ROK Civil Space Dialogue” by the end of the year, and to strengthen cooperation on the two countries space industries. They also commit to continue cooperation to ensure a safe, secure, and sustainable space environment including through the bilateral space policy dialogue and committed to strengthen defense space partnerships including through joint exercises.</p>



<p>President Yoon and President Biden agree that the Korea-U.S. Free Trade Agreement (KORUS), which celebrated its 10<sup>th</sup> anniversary this year, remains the foundation of our economic relationship. To promote sustainable growth and financial stability, including orderly and well-functioning foreign exchange markets, the two Presidents recognize the need to consult closely on foreign exchange market developments. The two Presidents share common values and an essential interest in fair, market-based competition and commit to work together to address market distorting practices.</p>



<p><strong>Global </strong><strong>Comprehensive Strategic Alliance: Beyond the Korean Peninsula</strong></p>



<p>Faced with increasingly complex global challenges including the threats posed by climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic, President Yoon laid out the ROK’s initiative for a global pivotal state that envisions a heightened role in advancing freedom, peace, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond. The two Presidents reaffirm their commitments to a global comprehensive strategic alliance firmly rooted in the shared values of promoting democracy and the rules-based international order, fighting corruption, and advancing human rights. President Biden appreciated President Yoon’s initiative to embrace greater regional and global responsibilities, and enthusiastically welcome the ROK taking a leadership role in <em>the Summit for Democracy </em>process.</p>



<p>Acknowledging the existential threat posed by climate change, President Yoon and President Biden reaffirm their commitments to their announced nationally determined contributions under the Paris Agreement including the 2030 greenhouse gas reduction targets and 2050 net zero emission goals with strong efforts to align policies across sectors. The two Presidents also agree to enhance cooperation to address methane emissions globally, recognizing the importance of the Global Methane Pledge and rapid global action needed to address methane. The two Presidents also decide to strengthen cooperation in clean energy fields such as hydrogen, clean shipping, accelerated deployment of zero-emissions vehicles (ZEVs) and aligning international financial flows with global net zero emissions by 2050 and deep reductions in the 2020s.</p>



<p>President Yoon and President Biden pledge to support in strengthening multilateral efforts to prevent, prepare, and respond to infectious disease threats. President Yoon underscored President Biden’s leadership in convening the Global COVID-19 Summit in May 2022, and President Biden appreciated President Yoon’s active participation and ROK’s announced pledges, including funding for the Act-Accelerator to combat COVID-19 and support for the Financial Intermediary Fund for pandemic preparedness and global health security at the World Bank. President Biden welcomes the ROK’s decision to host a Global Health Security Agenda ministerial meeting this Fall and establish a GHS coordinating office for global and regional sustainable health security in Seoul. Our countries will also increase efforts bilaterally and in multilateral fora to promote biosafety and biosecurity norms. The U.S. and ROK will also strengthen health systems and build on successful health sector collaboration to accelerate cooperation and innovation in cancer research, cutting edge cancer treatments, mental health research, early detection, and treatment of mental health disorders.</p>



<p>President Yoon and President Biden highlight their shared belief in the extraordinary benefits afforded by an open, free, global, interoperable, reliable, and secure Internet. To combat the rising threats posed by digital authoritarianism, they committed to defend human rights and foster an open “network of networks” that ensures the free flow of information globally. To achieve this, the ROK is ready to join the U.S. in endorsing <em>the Declaration for the Future of the Internet</em>. The two Presidents also reaffirm the need to ensure that the Internet continues to play a positive role in promoting equity, equality and safety for women and girls in both our societies. To this end, the U.S. and the ROK joined the Global Partnership for Action on Gender-Based Online Harassment and Abuse as founding members. Recognizing the importance of telecommunications security and vendor diversity, the leaders also commit to work together to develop open, transparent, and secure 5G and 6G network devices and architectures using Open-RAN approaches, both at home and abroad.</p>



<p>President Yoon and President Biden will continue to deepen ROK-U.S. cooperation on regional and international cyber policy, including cooperation on deterring cyber adversaries, cybersecurity of critical infrastructure, combatting cybercrime and associated money laundering, securing cryptocurrency and blockchain applications, capacity building, cyber exercises, information sharing, military-to-military cyber cooperation, and other international security issues in cyberspace.</p>



<p>President Yoon and President Biden oppose all activities that undermine, destabilize, or threaten the rules-based international order and stand together with the international community in condemning Russia’s unprovoked further aggression against Ukraine. Both countries, alongside other international partners, have responded resolutely to this clear violation of international law, by imposing their own financial sanctions and export controls against Russia and Russian entities, along with the vital provision of humanitarian aid to Ukraine. Both leaders affirm that they will ensure the effective implementation of their country’s respective measures to deter further Russian aggression and maintain our commitment to the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity.</p>



<p>The two Presidents recognize the importance of maintaining a free and open Indo-Pacific that is prosperous and peaceful, and agree to strengthen mutual cooperation across the region. In this regard, President Biden shares his support for President Yoon’s initiative to formulate ROK’s own Indo-Pacific strategy framework. President Yoon also welcomed the U.S. Indo-Pacific Strategy. The two Presidents commit to cooperate closely through the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF), based on the principles of openness, transparency, and inclusiveness. Both leaders agree to work together to develop a comprehensive IPEF that will deepen economic engagement on priority issues, including the digital economy, resilient supply chains, clean energy, and other priorities geared toward promoting sustainable economic growth.</p>



<p>President Yoon and President Biden also reaffirm their strong support for ASEAN centrality and the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific. The two Presidents commit to increase cooperation with Southeast Asia and the Pacific Island Countries to promote sustainable development, energy security, and high-quality, transparent investment, including in quality infrastructure. President Biden welcomes President Yoon’s interest in the Quad, and noted complementary ROK strengths including tackling the pandemic, fighting climate change and producing critical technologies. The two leaders also agree to cooperate on infrastructure financing, including digital infrastructure, in third countries. The two Presidents emphasize the importance of ROK-U.S.- Japan trilateral cooperation to effectively address common economic challenges.</p>



<p>President Yoon and President Biden reaffirm their commitment to maintain peace and stability, lawful unimpeded commerce, and respect for international law including freedom of navigation and overflight and other lawful use of the seas, including in the South China Sea and beyond. The two Presidents reiterate the importance of preserving peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait as an essential element in security and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region. Sharing our mutual concerns regarding human rights situations in the Indo-Pacific region, both leaders commit to promote human rights and rule of law globally. The two Presidents resolutely condemn the coup in Myanmar and the military’s brutal attacks on civilians, and commit to press for the immediate cessation of violence, the release of those who are detained, unfettered countrywide humanitarian access, and a swift return to democracy. The two Presidents call on all nations to join us in providing safe haven to Burmese nationals and in prohibiting arms sales to Myanmar.</p>



<p>President Yoon and President Biden share the view that the Alliance has matured into a deep and comprehensive strategic relationship. Through our close ties between the two dynamic populations, extensive economic and investment links, and commitment to democracy, human rights, and the rules-based international order, the ROK and the U.S. are charting a path toward a relationship that is capable of meeting any challenge and seizing all the opportunities presented before us. President Yoon and President Biden jointly recognize the importance of our shared commitments and pledge to work tirelessly to broaden and deepen our ties to position us to succeed in a rapidly changing world.</p>



<p>President Biden expressed his gratitude for President Yoon’s warm hospitality and extended an invitation for President Yoon to visit Washington at a time of mutual convenience.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Via Teleconference</p>



<p>9:12 A.M. KST</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Good morning, everybody.&nbsp; I hope you all had a restful night in Seoul.&nbsp; Apologies for the delay.</p>



<p>Thanks so much for joining us today on this background call.&nbsp; As mentioned on the invite, this call will be on background, attributable to &#8220;senior administration officials,&#8221; and embargoed until the call&#8217;s conclusion.</p>



<p>Not for reporting for just for everyone&#8217;s knowledge, joining us on this call is [senior administration official].&nbsp;</p>



<p>[Senior administration official] has some remarks to make off the top, and then we will take some questions before our speaker has to run into another commitment.</p>



<p>So, with that, I will turn it over to [senior administration official].</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Good morning, everyone.&nbsp; And thanks for joining both the trip and then joining us this morning.&nbsp; I’ll try and keep this as short as possible and take some questions.</p>



<p>So, as I&#8217;m sure all of you know, today the President has a packed day.&nbsp; But before I get into it, I do want to very quickly highlight yesterday’s tour of the Samsung Pyeongtaek facility by the President, President Yoon, and Secretary Raimondo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think as you all are aware, this is essentially the model of the facility that Samsung has &#8212; is starting to build in Taylor, Texas, that will create 3,000 new good-paying jobs.&nbsp; And it’s also an example of the strong partnership between the United States and the ROK, as well as the value of the relationship in terms of generating investment in the United States.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s an example of how the Biden administration is deepening our economic ties with the region to deliver for U.S. workers, businesses, consumers, and of course for people everywhere, including in the ROK.</p>



<p>You’ll see us continue to deepen our economic ties on this trip, including with the launch of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework.&nbsp; We firmly believe that much of what happens in the coming decades will depend on how well governments harness innovation &#8212; and especially the transformations afoot in clean energy and digital and tech sectors &#8212; while fortifying our economies from a range of vulnerabilities that we&#8217;ve seen, in particular, driven home by the impacts of the pandemic.&nbsp; And this ranges from fragile supply chains, to the vulnerabilities to disruption, to corruption, to tax havens.</p>



<p>And from our view, this requires a new model that we can move on quickly, and that&#8217;s what IPEF will do.&nbsp; We are pleased to see the very strong interests in the region for IPEF and for our economic engagement in the region, which we think reflects the continuing importance of an affirmative U.S. vision for the region, which we highlight in our Indo-Pacific strategy, as well as the desire in the region for continued U.S. economic leadership.</p>



<p>So, very quickly, to walk over today’s schedule.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We&#8217;ll start on &#8212; the first event will be: The President will participate in a wreath-laying ceremony to pay his respects to those who died to defend the Republic of Korea, many of whom died &#8212; many of those who died fought alongside U.S. forces in the Korean War.&nbsp; And I think this reflects the deep commitment to our joint security and to our alliance, and the President&#8217;s deep respect for those who paid the ultimate price to defend our freedoms.</p>



<p>I think that this also reflects what we see as one of the major things from the visit &#8212; or outcomes from the visit, which is continued collaboration in strengthening our alliance to deal with today&#8217;s challenges.</p>



<p>The President will then participate in a bilateral meeting with President Yoon Suk Yeol.  They will have extensive discussions on a range of issues, as I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;d expect.  We expect that there will be a joint statement. </p>



<p>And we expect that, you know, really, what we&#8217;re doing in this, as much as anything else, is building on the strong alliance &#8212; to expand it; to take it to deal with global issues and the issues and challenges of today; and, I think, also to take advantage of the visit, which comes so early in President Yoon&#8217;s time in office &#8212; I mean, this is unprecedented, as you all know &#8212; to really build a strong personal relationship between the two leaders that we think will help propel the relationship going forward.</p>



<p>And as you all know, the relationship between the U.S. and the ROK is something that is extraordinarily important to both countries but, we believe, is increasingly important for the region and to promote peace and stability and prosperity throughout the Indo-Pacific, as well as around the world.</p>



<p>So, you know, I think some of the key things that we expect the presidents to discuss will be the ROK&#8217;s role and the U.S.-ROK alliance&#8217;s role as a lynchpin for peace and security.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think that we expect that there will be some discussions on how to deal with some of the most recent threats and developments that have occurred.</p>



<p>We also believe that there will be discussion on how we can find ways to further expand our cooperation to make sure that we&#8217;re ready and &#8212; as ready as possible to deal with the threats of today.</p>



<p>I think that, you know, as you would expect, the presidents will discuss DPRK and, you know, reaffirm the continuing commitment to the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.</p>



<p>We believe that there will be discussion on how we can manage and address the most recent threats, particularly posed by the nuclear program, as well as the ongoing missile program.&nbsp; And very confident the leaders will stress the importance and agree on the importance of all countries fully enforcing U.N. Security Council resolutions.&nbsp; And also, we&#8217;re going to call on the DPRK to abide by its obligations under the U.N. Security Council resolutions.</p>



<p>I think the will discuss ways forward in &#8212; on a variety of issues associated with DPRK.&nbsp; And, you know, I don&#8217;t want to prejudge and get ahead of the discussions, but we&#8217;re very confident it will be very thorough, it will be very wide-ranging, and very detailed.<br><br>The presidents will also recognize the future of the alliance.&nbsp; It’s not just going to be defined by security, as has been the case in the past, but it’s also going to be defined by creating a strategic economic and technology partnership that really will reflect the importance of innovation and technology to both countries and to our work in the region going forward.</p>



<p>I think that the &#8212; we expect that there will be some work on how we can better support innovation, how we can support partnership on critical emerging technologies, and, you know, find ways to strengthen cooperation on defense industry issues.&nbsp;<br><br>I think that there will be work on &#8212; there&#8217;ll be discussion of secure supply chains and their importance.&nbsp; And I think that we’re very confident that we will have a discussion about the impact on global economic iss- &#8212; on the global economy of Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine.&nbsp; And that we know that there is great interest in both countries on how we can better make ourselves more resilient in the face of disruptions in global energy as well as other economic issues linked to Russia&#8217;s invasion.<br><br>I think that you can expect some discussion of both nuclear cooperation as well as other technology-related issues.&nbsp; And I think that you can also expect that there will be discussion of the importance of our own economic relationship bilaterally and how we can work together to bring prosperity to the region through the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework.<br><br>I think that we also recognize that, you know, as I said before, part of this visit is about turning a bilateral alliance into something that was traditionally very much focused on peace and stability in the Korean Peninsula, and then immediately in Northeast Asia, to something that really looks to the region &#8212; to the Indo-Pacific region &#8212; and to the world.<br><br>I think that there&#8217;s &#8212; there&#8217;ll be discussion about the threats posed by climate change, by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the importance of promoting democracy and shared values.<br><br>I think that we recognize that we also need to better work together to deal not just with the current pandemic but prepare for future ones.&nbsp; And so, I think that we&#8217;ll be looking for ways in which we can better cooperate, and I think the presidents will discuss that.<br><br>I think that we will have some discussion on other technology issues, including the importance of a free, open, secure Internet.&nbsp; I think that there&#8217;ll be some discussion about cyber.&nbsp; And I think that we will stress the importance of all countries standing together against efforts to destabilize the &#8212; or threaten the rules-based international order and, first and foremost, Ukraine.&nbsp; And we expect some pretty extensive discussions on Ukraine.&nbsp;<br><br>And I think the U.S. and the President will highlight the great U.S. appreciation for the Republic of Korea’s strong stance on Ukraine, both in terms of imposition of sanctions and taking of economic steps, and we&#8217;ll look for ways to expand that.</p>



<p>I think the ROK has been particularly strong on this, because I think they recognize that, because of their own history and our shared history together, the importance of a strong international reaction to invasions of this kind.</p>



<p>I think the presidents are going to discuss the importance of promoting a free and open Indo-Pacific, look for areas in which we can expand cooperation with both Southeast Asia as well as on the Pacific Islands, and look for ways in which we can better integrate our efforts across the entire range of Indo-Pacific issues.</p>



<p>I think that there will be some discussions about other issues involving regional security.&nbsp; And I don&#8217;t want to prejudge those, but I think that you will see that there &#8212;&nbsp;there is a great commonality in terms of our vision of the importance of a strong response to threats to the international order, particularly in the Indo-Pacific.<br><br>And I think that we strongly believe that this visit will highlight both what &#8212; how strong our alliance is today.&nbsp; But really, this is about building for the future, building a much stronger bilateral alliance and one that deals with strategic and issues globally, but also building a strong personal relationship with the leaders that will propel this going forward.<br><br>So, with that, I&#8217;ll take a few questions.</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Thanks so much, [senior administration official].&nbsp; If you have a question, please use the “raise hand” function of the Zoom interface.&nbsp; And we&#8217;ll try to get through as many questions as we can.<br><br>Why don&#8217;t we start with Aamer Madhani from the Associated Press?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hello.&nbsp; I&#8217;m sorry, I was having trouble with the mute button there.&nbsp; But so &#8212; hopefully, you can hear me.</p>



<p>Is there going to be an explicit message to Kim Jong Un today in what the President says in his public comments?&nbsp; And I was also wondering what, if any, assurances Jake Sullivan got from Yang Jiechi about addressing the North Korean issue in their talk?</p>



<p>And finally, do you &#8212; [senior administration official], do you believe there is any connection between the rise in COVID rates inside North Korea and Kim&#8217;s seemingly increased saber-rattling?&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Thanks very much.&nbsp; And I&#8217;m very sympathetic to problems with muting and unmuting.<br><br>So let me address a couple of things.&nbsp; I think, first of all, you know, I don&#8217;t want to get ahead of the discussions between the leaders.&nbsp; But I think you can expect that there will be extensive discussion about DPRK issues.<br><br>I think that we are very concerned about the COVID situation in the DPRK.&nbsp; We&#8217;re very sensitive to the fact that they’re &#8212; they appear to be facing a quite serious situation.&nbsp; And I think you&#8217;ve seen we are &#8212; we stand ready to work with others in the international community as needed to provide assistance.&nbsp; And that includes, obviously, the ROK, but it includes others and using the existing international mechanisms, but this is something that is of deep concern to us.</p>



<p>I think that in terms of, you know, your characterization of the increased saber-rattling, what we&#8217;ve seen is a fair amount of saber-rattling throughout the year.&nbsp; There have obviously been quite a few tests of ballistic missiles, some of which have been successful.</p>



<p>And I think that, you know, from our standpoint, we are ready.&nbsp; We &#8212; you know, we, at the same time, it is very much our desire that we find ways to have a diplomatic approach with the DPRK.&nbsp; We have made very clear we&#8217;re prepared to talk to them and with no preconditions, and we&#8217;re also prepared to take steps to address their domestic challenges, including COVID.</p>



<p>I think that in terms of the discussion with Yang Jiechi, as you&#8217;d expect, there was discussion about the challenges of the DPRK, including their domestic situation, the COVID issue.</p>



<p>I think that, you know, we&#8217;re looking for ways in which we and others in the international community can work together to provide assistance as needed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I think that the key thing is that we recognize that the DPRK has to make decisions about what they&#8217;re willing to do.&nbsp; It is our hope that they will make decisions that will allow for the maximum amount of support in this time of great need and great crisis.</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Thanks so much, [senior administration official].&nbsp; Next, let&#8217;s go to Trevor Hunnicutt with Reuters.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey, thanks so much for doing this.&nbsp; So, just wanted to follow up on what Aamer asked about a little bit there &#8212; was just if there was any level of commitment from China to help on the North Korea situation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And also, do you expect this joint statement to deal with what you&#8217;ve described as China&#8217;s destabilizing policies towards Taiwan, its human rights issues?</p>



<p>And also, if you could talk a little bit about what the President is doing this morning.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thank you.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Yeah. &nbsp;So, you know, I think, first, with regard to the joint statement, I don&#8217;t want to prejudge the discussions, but I think that, you know, we expect extensive discussions about regional security issues.&nbsp; And the fact that, in our view, both leaders of both countries strongly support preserving peace and stability in the region.</p>



<p>I think that with re- &#8212; I don’t want to get into the specifics of the discussions between Jake Sullivan and Yang Jiechi, but just to say that, of course, we are looking for ways in which it is possible to provide assistance and support to the DPRK as they deal with this COVID outbreak.</p>



<p>I think that, in terms of the broader issues that you raised, I think that we want to find ways to work with the international community to provide support to the DPRK.&nbsp; I think we also want to make clear that the international community stands united in opposition to their violations of U.N. Security Council resolutions and their destabilizing and threatening behavior.</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Thanks so much.&nbsp; Next, why don&#8217;t we go to Esther Oh with NHK.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, thank you so much for doing this.&nbsp; Just two questions.&nbsp; I know previously the administration says it has no plans to share vaccines with North Korea directly, but is the President planning to discuss with President Yoon ways that the U.S. and South Korea can work together to provide any sort of direct COVID aid to North Korea?</p>



<p>And my second question is: Will the President directly address the immediate need for South Korea and Japan to improve their bilateral ties?&nbsp; Because the relationship between the two countries &#8212; it&#8217;s deteriorated significantly in the last several years.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Thank you very much.&nbsp; Those are both, obviously, very good and very important questions.&nbsp; I think that you could expect that the leaders will discuss the COVID situation.&nbsp; I think that it&#8217;s &#8212; it&#8217;s very clear that we have a common interest in doing whatever we can to address this challenge and working through the international &#8212; with the international communities through whatever mechanism is appropriate.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t want to get ahead of those discussions, but I think that you can expect that this is something that&#8217;s very topical and we recognize that this is of great importance to the DPRK&#8217;s neighbors, as well as to us.</p>



<p>I think that with regard to the ROK-Japan relations, I think, you know, we strongly support improved ROK-Japan relations.&nbsp; At the same time, we recognize this is something that both countries are &#8212; it&#8217;s sensitive and important for both countries.&nbsp; And I think the President will make clear his support while also making clear his understanding of the need for this to be done in a way that&#8217;s mutually acceptable and agreeable to both countries.</p>



<p>However, it&#8217;s very clear that from the U.S. perspective &#8212; and we&#8217;ve been clear about this in the past &#8212; it is not in our interest for the relationship between the two of our closest and most political allies to not be strong.&nbsp; And so we want &#8212; we very much hope and support efforts by either sides, by both sides to take steps to improve the relationship.</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Thanks so much.&nbsp; I think we have time for just a couple more questions before our speaker has to hop.&nbsp; Why don&#8217;t we go to Paris Huang with the Voice of America next.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hello.&nbsp; Hi, thank you for doing this.&nbsp; So, earlier you mentioned about the &#8212; part of this visit is for us to ensure the peace and stability in East Asia.&nbsp; I just would like to clarify: Is that specifically means Taiwan?&nbsp; And what is your assessment on President Yoon&#8217;s attitude toward issues around China and Taiwan?&nbsp; And will the language be clearly written in a joint statement?&nbsp; So, that&#8217;s the first question.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The second, on the Quad: Is the Biden administration &#8212; on the expansion of &#8220;Quad Plus&#8221; &#8212; or is South Korea directly involved with the Quad summit on this time?&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Okay, great.&nbsp; So, let me take the first question.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Look, when we talk about maintaining peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region, we&#8217;re clearly talking about the entire Indo-Pacific region.&nbsp; There are a number of areas where there are challenges, and I would note that, you know, very clearly the leaders will be talking about one that is closer to where we are now.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But I think that it&#8217;s clear that, you know, both countries have a very strong interest in preserving peace and stability.&nbsp; I think you can expect the leaders to talk about that and to look for ways in which we can work more effectively together to do that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think, on the issue of the Quad, I don&#8217;t want to get ahead of the discussions.&nbsp; Obviously, you know, I think that this is a topic of great interest.&nbsp; I think that we don&#8217;t want to get ahead of the discussion with the leaders, but, also, I think that we have to recognize that the Quad is still developing, and so we&#8217;re looking for ways in which we can reinforce and strengthen what we&#8217;ve done so far.&nbsp; But at the same time, I think that we welcome any support for the Quad.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But I think that the issue of participation is one that we will still be working on.&nbsp; I think that you can expect &#8212; you know, I am biased, but I think you can expect that a joint statement will be clear.&nbsp; And I think we look forward to being able to, you know, really highlight how much we have in common, how similar our viewpoints are on a very wide range of issues, how close the two countries are, and how much we expect them to come closer on a very wide range of issues dealing with the challenges of today, but also challenges that we have (inaudible) to working on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think one of the things that, you know, for us &#8212; and this is not just a visit in Seoul today; this is about the entire trip &#8212; this is about demonstrating the unity and resolve and strengthening the coordination between our closest allies and &#8212; or two of our closest allies, and also strengthening our alliances to deal with problems that we are all dealing with today.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, I think that we&#8217;re very optimistic that we are &#8212; you know, we&#8217;ve done a great deal of groundwork.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think we have to really recognize &#8212; and I&#8217;d ask everyone to just be very sensitive to this &#8212; this is day 11 for the Yoon administration.&nbsp; This is the earliest that we&#8217;ve ever had an American President visit an ROK President in an ROK President&#8217;s time in office.&nbsp; It is normal that in &#8212; you know, in 11 days, it takes a while for an administration to come up to speed.&nbsp; We&#8217;re very impressed with what the Yoon administration has done.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We&#8217;re very happy with the work we&#8217;ve been able to do together, but I think it&#8217;s also important to recognize that it is unrealistic to expect any administration to have fully settled in only 11 days.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So we think that we&#8217;ve done quite well.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re very, very impressed by what&#8217;s been done and by the spirit of partnership, the spirit of tru- &#8212; of really genuine allies who are used to being together when times are bad, as well as when times are good.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re confident that that&#8217;s going to continue, and that we&#8217;ll be able to highlight the way forward for the alliance.</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Thanks so much.&nbsp; And I think we&#8217;ve got time for one last question.&nbsp; So last question.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s go to MJ Lee with CNN.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Given that this bilateral meeting comes, as you just said, 11 days into President Yoon’s presidency and particularly given that he doesn&#8217;t have much of a foreign policy background: Are there areas you can point to where you all think, you know, there are serious question marks in terms of President Yoon’s positions on major foreign policy issues and where just the President &#8212; President Biden is keen on trying to draw him out today and gain a better understanding of where he stands?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Look, I would push back very hard against the premise of that.&nbsp; I think we are very impressed with the cohesion, the coherence, and the clarity of the Yoon administration&#8217;s vision for its &#8212; for the ROK, for the ROK-U.S. relationship and the ROK role in the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think that what &#8212; in our discussions with them &#8212; and look, I&#8217;ve done &#8212; I&#8217;ve been doing this for a long time &#8212; I think we&#8217;ve been very, very impressed with how focused and how clear they&#8217;ve been, how decisive they&#8217;ve been.&nbsp; And I think that reflects, in our view, a great deal of potential to really strengthen the alliance going forward.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think that, in terms of the President&#8217;s engagement with President Yoon, I think that, clearly, they’re going to &#8212; this &#8212; part of the purpose here is two leaders of countries who have a very, very vital relationship, a close alliance getting to know each other.&nbsp; I think you all know: There is no substitute for that kind of direct engagement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I think we got off to a very good start last night at the Samsung plant.&nbsp; I think that their interaction was very positive.&nbsp; And I think that, you know, it went very well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I know that the President was quite satisfied and quite impressed.&nbsp; We&#8217;re looking forward to more of that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think that part of this is obviously getting to understand each other &#8212; I think to understand each other&#8217;s worldviews.&nbsp; I think that the President has &#8212; looks forward to doing that and getting to know President Yoon.</p>



<p>But I think that this is done in the context of tremendous confidence in the Yoon administration’s commitment to the alliance and clarity of their vision on foreign policies issues.&nbsp; And I think that, you know, from our standpoint, this is about building on a very strong foundation, rather than trying to lay any groundwork.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Thanks so much.&nbsp; And thanks so much everybody for joining this morning.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a reminder, this call was on background, attributable to “senior administration officials,&#8221; and embargoed until the call concludes, which will be shortly.</p>



<p>Thanks so much for joining.&nbsp; And we, of course, will be in touch throughout the rest of the trip.&nbsp;</p>

I also thank my entire team at OSD Public Affairs. When I messed up, they fixed it. When I did well, they made it so. I’ve never known a better team of professionals.

<p>The Administration disagrees with the court’s ruling, and the Department of Justice has announced that it will appeal this decision. The authority to set public health policy nationally should rest with the Centers for Disease Control, not with a single district court.&nbsp; However, in compliance with the court’s injunction, the Biden Administration will continue to enforce the CDC’s 2020 Title 42 public health authority pending the appeal.&nbsp; This means that migrants who attempt to enter the United States unlawfully will be subject to &nbsp;expulsion under Title 42, as well as immigration consequences such as removal under Title 8.</p>



<p>As the appeal proceeds, the Department of Homeland Security will continue planning for the eventual lifting of Title 42 in light of CDC’s public health judgment, at which point anyone who attempts to enter the country unlawfully will be subject to Title 8 Expedited Removal proceedings, if they do not have grounds to remain in the United States.</p>

<p>Americans across the country are back to work at a historic level. Right now, workers in Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, West Virginia, and Wisconsin are less likely to be unemployed than in any other time on record.&nbsp;The unemployment rate did not increase in any of our 50 states.</p>



<p>This news comes on the heels of new data showing that the number of Americans who are forced to rely on unemployment insurance programs for their support fell to its lowest level in over 52 years and that the economy has added more than 8 million jobs since I took office – more jobs on average per month than under any other President in history.</p>



<p>​This job creation is no accident – it’s the direct result of my economic plan to rebuild the economy from the bottom up and the middle out through the historic American Rescue Plan and a nationwide vaccination strategy. There is more work to do to build an economy that works for all Americans. Tackling inflation is my top priority. But we cannot lose sight of the fact that millions of workers are now able to better provide for themselves and their families and enjoy the dignity that a good-paying job provides.</p>

<p>From sea to shining sea, whether in still or raging waters, America has always been a Nation of maritime travel.  Across our 25,000 miles of waterways and over 360 commercial ports, the United States Merchant Marine is integral to our Nation&#8217;s prosperity.  From helping move goods throughout the supply chain to supporting our troops wherever they are deployed, the Merchant Marine plays a vital role in the economic security and defense of our country.  On National Maritime Day and every day, we honor the Merchant Marines for their service and sacrifice and acknowledge their crucial role in protecting our Nation&#8217;s security and commerce.</p>



<p>Today, our Merchant Marine remains inextricably linked to our national and economic security and competitiveness.  Merchant mariners&#8217; legacy of perseverance and dedication is carried on by today&#8217;s civilian mariners.  As tyranny and violence again cause the tragic loss of innocent lives and senseless destruction in Europe, our merchant mariners have answered the call of duty by crewing vessels of our United States Ready Reserve, moving vital military cargo to help the Ukrainian people in their defense of freedom.</p>



<p>We also salute the remarkable efforts of our entire maritime industry throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.  They put the well-being of the American people first, risking their lives to ensure that essential cargoes of medical supplies and personal protective equipment were delivered to those in need across our Nation.</p>



<p>As we continue to build a better America, our Merchant Marine plays a pivotal role in securing our coastal and inland waterways so that they are open to trade.  No matter the hardship, mariners provide a smooth passage for America&#8217;s critical domestic goods and serve as stewards of our Nation&#8217;s trading gateways with the rest of the world.  My Administration continues its unwavering support of the United States Merchant Marine, as well as the Jones Act, which protects the integrity of our domestic maritime industry, supports hundreds of thousands of jobs, and contributes over $150 billion in economic benefits.</p>



<p>We also know that the future success of the vital maritime industry depends on its ability to attract the talent of all Americans and reflect the diversity of the Nation it serves.  That is why we are resolved to continue the urgent work of advancing diversity, equity, and inclusion in the ranks of the Merchant Marine and to end sexual assault, sexual harassment, and bullying in the workplace.</p>



<p>Our Nation&#8217;s merchant mariners serve with honor and integrity each and every day.  Today, we recognize their service and sacrifice and recommit ourselves to fulfilling the promises and uplifting the values that they continue to protect.</p>



<p>The Congress, by a joint resolution approved May 20, 1933, has designated May 22 of each year as &#8220;National Maritime Day&#8221; to commemorate the first transoceanic voyage by a steamship in 1819 by the S.S. Savannah.&nbsp; By this resolution, the Congress has authorized and requested the President to issue annually a proclamation calling for its appropriate observance. &nbsp;I also request that all ships sailing under the American flag dress ship on that day.</p>



<p>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 22, 2022, as National Maritime Day.  I call upon all Americans to observe this day and to celebrate the United States Merchant Marine and maritime industry with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.</p>



<p>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twentieth day of May, in the year of our Lord two&nbsp;thousand&nbsp;twenty-two, and of the Independence of the United&nbsp;States of&nbsp;America the two&nbsp;hundred and forty-sixth.</p>

<p>On Armed Forces Day, we share our unending appreciation for the proud patriots who answer the call to serve, taking the sacred oath to defend our Constitution. &nbsp;The brave members of our Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Space Force, Coast Guard, and National Guard and Reserve forces represent the best of our Nation.&nbsp; Today and every day, we honor their immeasurable service on behalf of our grateful Nation.&nbsp;</p>



<p><br>On this special day of tribute, we recognize the sacrifices that our service members and their families make on our behalf, and we recommit to our solemn duty to support them as they protect us.&nbsp; Our Nation has a sacred obligation to properly equip and prepare our troops when we send them in to harm&#8217;s way and to support them &#8212; both while they are serving abroad and when they return home &#8212; as well as their families, caregivers, and survivors.&nbsp; We must meet this obligation.&nbsp;</p>



<p><br>My Administration&#8217;s unity agenda focuses on key issues that bring Americans together: &nbsp;supporting our veterans, beating the opioid epidemic, addressing our national mental health crisis, and ending cancer as we know it. &nbsp;Each of these issues impact our military community, and each is essential to meeting our obligation to our troops, their families, caregivers, and survivors.&nbsp; Mental health issues pose a real challenge to our service members and their families, and my Administration will continue to strengthen the tools, resources, and support for our military community so our brave service members, who have answered the call to serve, can thrive.&nbsp; This includes taking bold action to reduce suicide among service members, veterans, and their families.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><br>The success of our Armed Forces also rests on every member of our military community feeling that their safety and ability to prosper is prioritized as they defend our Nation.&nbsp; That is why my Administration is so focused on addressing the potential adverse consequences related to toxic exposures or exposures to other environmental hazards during deployment or in garrison. &nbsp;</p>



<p><br>Safety for our troops also means addressing the scourge of sexual harassment and sexual assault in our military. &nbsp;We have already taken important steps. &nbsp;In December, I was proud to sign into law historic military justice reforms as part of the 2022 National Defense Authorization Act. &nbsp;The Department of Defense is working to implement these critical changes, alongside recommendations from the Independent Review Commission on Sexual Assault in the Military for prevention, climate and culture, and victim care and support. &nbsp;Much work still lies ahead to deliver the progress that our troops deserve, and this will remain a top priority for my Administration. &nbsp;</p>



<p><br>Our diversity is one of our greatest strengths as a Nation, and we will continue to strive for our Armed Forces to reflect society at every level within its ranks. &nbsp;Ensuring equal opportunity and greater inclusivity will bolster the strength of our military and make sure every American knows they can succeed and thrive as a member of the United States Armed Forces.&nbsp; We&nbsp;are renewing our efforts to address the recruitment, retention, and well-being of women in the military as well as providing a path to service for other under-represented groups.&nbsp;</p>



<p><br>As we look around the world today, we are reminded again that freedom comes at great cost.&nbsp; Throughout our history, brave Americans have always stepped forward to defend our liberties &#8212; willing to pay the price to keep our country safe. &nbsp;Our Nation&#8217;s Armed Forces are the best in the world.&nbsp; And we know that it is not only the person who wears our Nation&#8217;s uniform that serves. Their loved ones serve as well.&nbsp; Today, we also honor the families, caregivers, and survivors of our Armed Forces &#8212; all those who sacrifice on our behalf and who give their all to support the service members they stand behind.</p>



<p>On Armed Forces Day, we salute our brave service members, whose dedication and sacrifice ensure that our Nation&#8217;s Armed Forces are unmatched in strength, unity, and resilience.&nbsp; They&nbsp;are the greatest fighting force the world has ever known.</p>



<p>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, and Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces of the United States, continuing the precedent of my predecessors in office, do hereby proclaim the third Saturday of each May as Armed Forces Day.</p>



<p><br>I direct the Secretary of Defense, on behalf of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Space Force, and the Secretary of Homeland Security on behalf of the Coast Guard, to plan for appropriate observances each year, with the Secretary of Defense responsible for soliciting the participation and cooperation of civil authorities and private citizens.&nbsp; I invite the Governors of the States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and other areas subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to provide for the observance of Armed Forces Day within their respective jurisdictions each year in an appropriate manner designed to increase public understanding and appreciation of the Armed Forces of the United States.&nbsp; I also invite veterans, civic leaders, and other organizations to join in the observance of Armed Forces Day each year.</p>



<p><br>Finally, I call upon all Americans to display the flag of the United States at their homes and businesses on Armed Forces Day, and I urge citizens to learn more about military service by attending and participating in the local observances of the day.</p>



<p><br>Proclamation 10210 of May 14, 2021, is hereby superseded.</p>



<p><br>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twentieth day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-sixth.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>Exploring America&#8217;s magnificent lakes, rivers, ponds, bays, and oceans has long been a favorite pastime for recreational boaters and a memorable way to discover our Nation&#8217;s natural treasures.&nbsp; As we prepare for warmer weather, and as more Americans take to the water, National Safe Boating Week reminds us of the importance of following responsible and safe boating practices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So many Americans enjoy recreational boating, and most trips are safe.  But many preventable accidents occur each year that result in tragic deaths and injuries.  Observing boating safety precautions is essential for all boaters, whether you are fishing, sailing, kayaking, or motoring.</p>



<p>Safe boating practices start well before the hull breaks the water&#8217;s surface.  Experts agree that taking a State-offered boating safety course is one of the best ways to minimize accidents.  Most boating fatalities involve boats whose operators &#8212; including paddlers in rentals &#8212; did not have proper boating safety education.  I urge all Americans to use the free assistance of the Coast Guard Auxiliary and America&#8217;s Boating Club to ensure that your vessels are safe and that operators have the tools they need to operate them safely.</p>



<p>I also call upon Americans to follow basic boating safety procedures and to always wear a life jacket to protect yourself and your loved ones.  In 2020, three-quarters of boating deaths were drownings, and nearly 7 out of every 8 drowning victims were not wearing a life jacket.  In addition, avoid using alcohol or drugs when operating a boat.  Alcohol continues to be a significant contributing factor in boating deaths, and its effects are compounded by water movement, exposure to the elements, and dynamic operating conditions.  Finally, wearing an engine cut-off switch link will stop the boat&#8217;s engine in the event the operator falls overboard, protecting everyone from vessel and propeller strikes.  By adhering to safe boating practices, Americans will be safer on the water while enjoying the boating season. </p>



<p>This week, we also pay tribute to the United States Coast Guard and the Federal, State, Tribal, and local partners who help save lives and protect us from accidents on the water.  This season, let us recommit to following basic boating safety procedures to prevent boating fatalities, avoid property damage, and help boaters stay safe as they enjoy the beauty of the open water. </p>



<p>In recognition of the importance of safe boating practices, the Congress, by joint resolution approved on June 4, 1958 (36 U.S.C. 131), as amended, has authorized and requested the President to proclaim annually the 7-day period before Memorial Day weekend as &#8220;National Safe Boating Week.&#8221;</p>



<p>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim May 21 through May 27, 2022, as National Safe Boating Week.  I encourage all Americans who participate in boating activities to observe this occasion by learning more about safe boating practices, and by taking advantage of boating safety education opportunities.  I also encourage the Governors of the States and Territories, and appropriate officials of all units of government, to join me in encouraging boating safety in every community.</p>



<p>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twentieth day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-sixth.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-right">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.</p>
