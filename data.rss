										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>In his first State of the Union, the President spoke directly to the American people about his vision to build a better America. He reminded the country that our best days lie ahead, and that his Presidency is about giving everyone a fair shot – because when given half a shot, ordinary people can do extraordinary things. The Biden-Harris Administration’s domestic agenda represents an historic shift from the old, outdated trickle-down approach to one that puts workers, families, and small businesses first.</p>



<p>The President also announced his unity agenda, consisting of four areas where we have historically been able to come together and find agreement regardless of party. He has called on Congress to send bills to his desk to deliver progress for the American people: to beat the opioid crisis, address mental health, support our veterans, and end cancer as we know it.</p>



<p>Over the next year, the Biden-Harris Administration will continue working to make communities safer, combat COVID, and create good-paying jobs through revitalized domestic manufacturing.</p>



<p>A wide range of constituencies and community leaders championed the President’s remarks.</p>



<p><em>Here’s what they are saying:</em></p>



<h3>Asian Americans and Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders</h3>



<p><strong>Sung Yeon Choimorrow, Executive Director, National Asian Pacific American Women’s Forum (NAPAWF): </strong>“We applaud President Biden for bringing visibility and support to the Asian American and Pacific Islander community during a time of heightened anti-Asian violence and rhetoric. We have been advocating for the President and other elected officials to acknowledge hate crimes against the AAPI community and it’s disproportionate impact on Asian American and Pacific Islander women. The recent tragic deaths in New York City and Albuquerque, nearly one year after the Atlanta Spa shootings, is yet another sobering reminder of the current state of safety for AAPI women.” [<a href="https://www.napawf.org/press-releases/030122">Statement</a>, 3/1/22]</p>



<p><strong>Christine Chen, Executive Director, Asian and Pacific Islander American Vote (APIA Vote): </strong>“Tonight, President Biden made two things clear: ending violence against Asian American and Pacific Islander communities, and fighting for voting rights remain high priorities for this administration. Despite the several challenges presented to the United States since he took office, we are pleased that our communities’ livelihood and our freedom to vote are at the forefront of his agenda. Anti-Asian hate has existed long before COVID-19, but the ongoing pandemic has exacerbated discrimination and violence towards AAPIs to dangerous levels. We were pleased when President Biden signed the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act into law last year, and reauthorized the White House Initiative on Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders. We look forward to continuing to work with the White House on the issues that impact AAPIs’ everyday lives.” [<a href="https://www.apiavote.org/press/SOTU2022">Statement</a>, 3/1/22]</p>



<p><strong>Juliet K. Choi, President and CEO, Asian &amp; Pacific Islander American Health Forum (APIAHF):</strong> “President Biden’s State of the Union highlighted historic firsts that his Administration has achieved, including the enactment of the bipartisan law to address anti-Asian hate. We applaud and echo the President’s calls on Congress to reform our country, making it affordable, safe and healthy for all Americans. This includes permanently reducing the cost of health insurance premiums, prescription drug prices and investing in mental health. The Biden-Harris administration has continuously put racial equity at the forefront of its policies, and we are encouraged to see the investments to ensure every community has access to the resources and tools to address our collective challenges, from COVID-19 to hate incidents to the cancer moonshot. We are inspired by President Biden’s vision for a better, healthier America, and look forward to continuing progress toward equity and justice.” [<a href="https://www.apiahf.org/press-release/apiahf-response-to-president-bidens-first-state-of-the-union/">Statement</a>, 3/1/22]</p>



<p><strong>Southeast Asia Resource Center (SEARAC): </strong>“President Biden’s vision for America is in stark contrast to the previous Administration, which actively undermined the health and wellbeing of Southeast Asian Americans. In particular, the President’s emphasis on parity between physical and mental health would help Southeast Asians who continue to struggle with trauma from the war, the ensuing generational trauma that lingers in our communities, and mental harm from increased anti-Asian violence. Holistic, well-funded health resources for Southeast Asian Americans that address the concerns of all community members – from increased access to mental health services for students, to support for older adults and those who are care for them – are essential to our community’s success in society, especially as we navigate the twin pandemics of COVID-19 and anti-Asian hate.” [<a href="https://www.searac.org/national/searac-responds-to-state-of-the-union/">Statement</a>, 3/2/22]</p>



<p><strong>Japanese American Citizens League (JACL): </strong>“Yesterday, President Joe Biden delivered his first State of the Union address, in which he called for bipartisanship and support for Ukraine. We applaud President Biden and his team for signing 80 bipartisan bills into law last year, including the Covid-19 Hate Crimes Act introduced by Representative Grace Meng and Senator Mazie Hirono.&nbsp; We extend our appreciation for his commitment to &#8220;protecting Asian-Americans from still-too-common hate crimes,” and we look forward to continuing our work to monitor and ensure that elements of the Hate Crimes Act are implemented to best support and protect our Asian Pacific American communities. Japanese Americans have a long tradition of service to our country, most notably during WWII when Japanese American men served while their families remained incarcerated in American concentration camps. We praise President Biden’s pledge to provide comprehensive health care and benefits to veterans. Every veteran deserves the highest quality care, and we as a nation have too long neglected fulfilling this promise. Just as so many veterans struggle with mental health, so too have many more Americans due to the COVID pandemic, particularly children. We join the Biden Administration in their efforts to address the mental health pandemic that has accompanied COVID and affected our most vulnerable populations disproportionately.&#8221; [<a href="https://jacl.org/statements/jacl-responds-to-the-state-of-the-union">Statement</a>, 3/2/22]</p>



<p><strong>Seema Agnani, Executive Director, National CAPACD: </strong>“There has been a seismic shift in our country, which has presented the opportunity for real change and strong leadership; we have witnessed the Administration step into this role through unprecedented appointments to key agencies and boards, bold action against hate and racism, and advocacy on climate change. We commend the President for the spirit of hope and promise in the State of the Union, and we will continue to work closely with the Administration to deliver on the promise of opportunity, access, and inclusion for all Americans, as well as the commitment to advance racial justice.” [Statement, 3/2/22]</p>



<p><strong>OCA – Asian Pacific American Advocates:</strong> “Since day one, the Biden-Harris administration has worked to earn the trust of Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander families, and their support is especially meaningful as our communities continue to combat tragic violence and pandemic health disparities. In less than a year, the president appointed a senior White House AANHPI community liaison, expanded the White House Initiative on AANHPIs, and signed the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act into law. Tonight’s brief but historic nod to our communities is important, and we look forward to engaging with the administration on the racial profiling of scholars of Asian descent and the work that lays ahead to truly protect AANHPI women, elders, and children.” [<a href="https://www.ocanational.org/press-releases/oca-responds-after-biden-delivers-nod-to-asian-american-communities-in-first-state-of-the-union-address">Statement</a>, 3/1/22]</p>



<p><strong>National Asian Pacific American Women’s Forum (NAPAWF):</strong> “1/ BREAKING: Tonight, President Joe Biden took the unprecedented step of including the surge and escalation of violence and hate towards the AAPI community in his first #StateOfTheUnion address.” [<a href="https://twitter.com/NAPAWF/status/1498856878750814208?s=20&amp;t=FVXsGa0Wc34gCBC72bVV4w">Tweet thread</a>, 3/1/22]</p>



<p><strong>John C. Yang, Executive Director, Asian Americans Advancing Justice – AAJC:</strong> “As you can tell, I care deeply about what is being said right now.&nbsp; I very much appreciate @POTUS recognizing that anti-Asian violence is &#8220;still too common.&#8221; [<a href="https://twitter.com/johncyangdc/status/1498856064212733959?s=20&amp;t=Qrc2N73TOe9VwUHmXdZJnw">Tweet</a>, 3/1/22]</p>



<p><strong>Asian Americans Advancing Justice – AAJC:</strong> “Thank you @POTUS for turning a spotlight during #SOTU22 on the continued hate and violence against Asian Americans, and recognizing that what our community has been experiencing is &#8220;still-too-common.&#8221; #StateOfTheUnionAddress” [<a href="https://twitter.com/AAAJ_AAJC/status/1498868403372761089?s=20&amp;t=5wf-ooMb9HpeZyfCMTbI-g">Tweet</a>, 3/1/22]</p>



<p><strong>Southeast Asia Resource Action Center (SEARAC):</strong> “Parity between physical and mental health care? Yes, @POTUS! 👏 We support President Biden&#8217;s vision for a country where our diverse communities get the mental health care they desperately need.” [<a href="https://twitter.com/SEARAC/status/1498859173261418499?s=20&amp;t=Qrc2N73TOe9VwUHmXdZJnw">Tweet thread</a>, 3/1/22]</p>



<p><strong>Asian &amp; Pacific Islander American Health Forum (APIAHF):</strong> “Let&#8217;s close the coverage gap and make these savings permanent.&#8221; &#8211; @potus #SOTU #SOTU2022” [<a href="https://twitter.com/APIAHF/status/1498849891208294402?s=20&amp;t=RlMhF1amtkXV_Kb7_OwjhA">Tweet</a>, 3/1/22]</p>



<p><strong>Indian American Impact: </strong>“Less than half of Americans with mental health conditions receive treatment, and South Asian Americans are disproportionately undertreated. We’re thrilled to hear @POTUS share his national strategy for addressing the national mental health crisis. #SOTU.” [<a href="https://twitter.com/IA_Impact/status/1498856239085895688?s=20&amp;t=-BteTXRQFDoBPGKzrBKrhg">Tweet</a>, 3/1/22]</p>



<p><strong>The Asian American Foundation:</strong> “TAAF thanks President Biden for his leadership on lifting up the importance of protecting 23 million Asian Americans in his State of the Union address.” [<a href="https://twitter.com/taaforg/status/1499184358992662528?s=20&amp;t=fCsYuBQnohIUPgLTC0rWpw">Tweet</a>, 3/1/22]</p>

<p><strong>AAPI Victory Alliance:</strong> “Our right to vote is under attack. More than a dozen states have passed laws making it hard for people to vote.

<p><strong>African American Mayors Association: </strong>“@OurMayors&nbsp; support the Biden administration’s response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and we stand united with @POTUS and our allies in holding president Vladimir Putin accountable for this unprovoked war.&nbsp; #StateOfTheUnion #SOTU2022” [<a href="https://twitter.com/OurMayors/status/1498843720979996673">Tweet</a>, 3/1/22]</p>

<p><strong>Billy Mitchell, President, National Black Caucus of State Legislators: </strong>“President’s Biden speech last night regarding the state of our union offered hope, stability, and a plan we can count on to help all Americans now and in the future. His vision for rebuilding our economy so that it helps our middle and low-income families aligns with the goals of NBCSL. As state legislators, we work every day in our state houses to ensure affordability for African American families and other minority families across this nation.&nbsp; We applaud President Biden for the promises he has kept in his first year of office, such as providing critical COVID-19 relief to Americans. We support the President fully in getting Americans vaccinated to combat COVID-19 and end this pandemic.&nbsp; Furthermore, we look forward to the continued work on our nation’s infrastructure. We support the bipartisan effort to invest in our roads, bridges, affordable broadband, and clean water in all our communities—including rural communities. We must rebuild America—a task that NBCSL has been committed to over the years and will remain committed.&nbsp; Many of our constituents are suffering from high drug prices and cannot afford their medication that is essential to them living a healthy life. We applaud President Biden’s efforts to lower the drug prices and encourage permanent savings through the American Rescue Plan and Affordable Care Act. NBCSL stands with this nation and stand up for democracy across the world. We are against Russian aggression and stand with Ukraine.&nbsp; Lastly, after the failed attempt to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to Vote Act, NBCSL is still committed to ensuring everyone has the right to vote. We continue to put the pressure on President Biden and his administration to make sure that these two pieces of legislation pass the Senate or some form of voter protection legislation will pass and put into law. We look forward to President Biden’s continued leadership in this nation and NBCSL looks forward to continuing to work with this administration to help our constituents and achieve the mission and goals of NBCSL.” [<a href="https://nbcsl.org/media-center/press-releases/item/2352-nbcsl-president-billy-mitchell-statement-on-president-biden%E2%80%99s-sotu-address.html">Statement</a>, 3/1/22]</p>



<p><strong>Dr. Michael Lomax, President &amp; CEO, United Negro College Fund</strong>: “The Biden administration will push for a $2,000 increase to the maximum for a Pell Grant, which is the nation’s effort to assist students coming from lower socio-economic backgrounds to fund their higher education pursuits.&nbsp; Increasing HBCU funding is a priority on which the Biden-Harris White House and UNCF have long collaborated.&nbsp;This is a continuation of our shared goals. We have worked with this White House, even before they moved in, to formulate these asks. I applaud the president for including both HBCUs and a Pell Grant increase in his State of the Union address, and I hope both items will be championed by both sides of the aisle.”&nbsp;[Statement, 3/1/22]</p>



<p><strong>Lodriguez V. Murray, Senior Vice President for Public Policy and Government Affairs, United Negro College Fund:</strong> “This is historic. For the president of the United States to not only mention HBCUs in his State of the Union address, but to call for increased funding along with joining our effort to increase, and hopefully soon double the Pell Grant, is something we cannot help but be excited about. “It is rare in Washington for a leader to stand by priorities. It is rarer for HBCUs to be that priority. President Biden is really showing that he stands with students from vulnerable backgrounds and the institutions that best serve their needs, and those are HBCUs. UNCF hopes Congress will pass the FY 2022 appropriations bills at the highest levels for HBCUs and the Pell Grant, and then let’s do even better in FY 2023.” [Statement, 3/1/22]</p>



<p><strong>Spencer Overton, President, The Joint Center</strong>: “.@POTUS to US Senate: Confirm my @federalreserve nominees.&nbsp; Yes, please confirm @drlisadcook! #SOTU” [<a href="https://twitter.com/SpencerOverton/status/1498852068668362752">Tweet</a>, 3/1/22]</p>



<p><strong>NAACP: </strong>“Tonight, we witnessed the President deliver a State of the Union that spoke to policing in America, healthcare, the cost of education, geopolitical warfare, inflation, childcare, and more. In addition, he offered up firm ideals of what he envisions for the future of our country when it comes to leveling the playing field for low to middle-income families. His words were impactful, but we look forward to the actions that will answer the continued needs of all who aspire to reach this nation&#8217;s promise.”&nbsp; [<a href="https://naacp.org/articles/naacp-responds-state-union">Statement</a>, 3/1/22]</p>

<h3>Business</h3>



<p><strong>Mary Barra, CEO, General Motors and Chair, Business Roundtable: </strong>“We face unprecedented challenges that require bold solutions. Business Roundtable is committed to working with the Biden Administration and both parties in Congress to preserve U.S. economic strength and global leadership and to expand opportunity for all Americans. We will continue to work to address pandemic-related challenges, including labor market and supply chain disruptions, and to advocate for sound economic policies that position the United States to compete and thrive over the long term. We believe there are many opportunities to work with policymakers of both parties to advance policy solutions that meet the needs of our country, U.S. businesses, workers and families over the year to come.” [<a href="https://www.businessroundtable.org/business-roundtable-chair-we-face-unprecedented-challenges-that-require-bold-solutions">Statement</a>, 3/1/22]</p>



<p><strong>Liz Fairchild, Executive Director, Business Forward: </strong>“Since President Biden took office last year, America’s 32.5 million small businesses have made it clear what issues matter to their business, their employees, and their communities. Last night, the President spoke directly to these key issues, including rising costs, attacks on our democracy, and upholding America’s rule of law. President Biden highlighted the urgent need to confirm his nominees to the Federal Reserve, which he emphasized would play a “critical role” in fighting inflation and explained how a timely confirmation process will advance his plan to bring costs down for working families and lower the deficit. Local business leaders know that a responsive government is essential to a strong economy, and amid a critical moment for democracies around the world, the President reiterated the importance of prioritizing transparency in democracy. He called on the Senate to pass both the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. Less than a week since Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson’s nomination to the Supreme Court, small businesses have already vocalized widespread support, including within our network. President Biden used last night’s address to describe Judge Jackson as a “consensus builder” who has immediately received broad support from across the aisle. I urge our elected officials to take these critical measures in support of the small business community, the backbone of our nation’s economy.” [<a href="http://https/www.businessforward.org/press/statement-from-liz-fairchild-on-the-state-of-the-union/">Statement</a>, 3/2/22]&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Rhett&nbsp;Buttle, Founder, Public Private Strategies: “</strong>In tonight’s State of the Union address, the President laid out a plan to build upon the economic progress made over the last year and continue America’s leadership for democracy, at home and abroad. The American Rescue Plan and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal have contributed to the fastest economic growth our country has experienced in 40 years, including the creation of nearly 6 million jobs, the lowest rate of unemployment claims since 1969, and a $90 billion increase in retail sales. This is crucial progress we&#8217;ve made in overcoming the economic challenges presented by the pandemic, but there is more work to do. Small businesses across the country need policies that will continue to give them a fighting chance, like lowering the cost of healthcare and prescription drugs, increasing access to capital, and modernizing our economy to support small business employees. This includes delivering paid leave programs and affordable childcare for owners and employees, which will help build a stronger, more resilient workforce.&#8221; [Statement, 3/1/22]&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Cristina Morales Heaney, Board Chair, National Association of Women Business Owners:</strong>&nbsp;&#8220;NAWBO is pleased to see the President putting the need for workforce training in the forefront of his economic policy agenda,&#8221; said &#8220;In a recent survey of NAWBO&#8217;s women business owners, 40% of NAWBO&#8217;s women business owners reported difficulty hiring last fall. We truly believe our nation must provide training to close the skills gap or reskill our workforce to ensure that women business owners have access to talent and can compete to build sustainable businesses. We hope bipartisan efforts will work to bring this idea to fruition.&#8221; [<a href="https://www.nawbo.org/press-release/nawbo-responds-presidents-state-union" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Statement</a>, 3/1/22]&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Anne Zimmerman, C0-Chair, Small Business for America’s Future: </strong>“During his first State of the Union address, President Biden rightfully highlighted the strong economic progress we have been made, but we were most heartened that he did not shrink from the need to do more to help Main Street small businesses recover from the biggest shock they’ve experienced in a century … We also support President Biden’s call on Congress to provide the resources needed to expand prosecutions of egregious pandemic fraud. PPP loans were meant for small businesses facing layoffs and closures due to the pandemic—individuals who fraudulently obtained loans meant for struggling entrepreneurs should be held accountable. As we look ahead, we are optimistic about the work the Biden-Harris Administration is doing to help entrepreneurs and urge Congress to take up the policies the president proposed to help our small business community. To maximize our economic recovery, we must seize opportunities to enact policies that help our small business community, which creates two-thirds of all new jobs and employs half of all workers, succeed. With the proper policies—addressing the cost of childcare, creating paid leave programs and bringing down healthcare and drug costs chief among them— in place, America’s small businesses will flourish and lead our economy to prosperity.&#8221; [<a href="https://www.smallbusinessforamericasfuture.org/small-business-group-biden-harris-administration-making-substantial-progress-in-support-of-main-street-still-more-work-to-do">Statement</a>, 3/1/22]</p>

From the climate provisions in reconciliation to the bipartisan Recovering America’s Wildlife Act, the president should make it clear that his Administration can meet the moment we face and bridge Washington’s partisan divide.&nbsp;President Biden should speak to this notable recent history and challenge Congress to join with him to pass solutions as big as the problems facing people and wildlife today.” [<a href="https://www.nwf.org/Latest-News/Press-Releases/2022/3-1-22-SOTU-Statement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Statement</a>, 3/1/22]&nbsp;</p>

We join him in his call for Congress to pass his bold and transformative climate and energy agenda that will deliver good-paying jobs, lower costs for families, provide cleaner air and water, and fight climate change. The Biden Administration has already demonstrated its commitment to a ‘whole of government’ approach to climate action. Under the president’s leadership, America has rejoined the Paris Climate Agreement, federal agencies are implementing ambitious climate strategies, and the federal government is implementing the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, including investments that will help drive meaningful climate progress. Now Congress needs to act. Congress has the power to enact the bold, transformative legislation laid out by the president. For the sake of America’s families, communities and future, Congress must get this done.&#8221; [<a href="https://www.edf.org/media/president-biden-reaffirms-his-commitment-transformative-clean-energy-economy-bill">Statement</a>, 3/1/22]</p>

Now, with Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine, we have even more reason to accelerate our country’s transition to clean energy. Our national security is linked directly to our energy security. The more we wean ourselves off oil as well as gas and use more advanced energy, the safer we will be. Global conflict in recent decades has revolved around fossil fuels. The way to put an end to the power of those who use these fuels as a weapon is to stop buying their products.&nbsp; We need a transition to clean energy for our economy too. Continued dependence on oil and gas puts our households and businesses at risk of energy price spikes like the ones now hitting Americans in their heating bills and at the gas pump right now. That’s because these fuels are commodities traded in global markets, making them volatile by nature.&#8221; [<a href="https://www.aee.net/articles/aee_ceo_statement_sotu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Statement</a>, 3/1/22]&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Gene Karpinski, President, League of Conservation Voters: </strong>“As we heard from President Biden tonight, we can strengthen the state of our union by making transformative investments in clean energy, climate, justice and jobs at home in the United States. We couldn’t agree more with the President that Congress needs to meet the moment on climate by enacting the House-passed $555 billion investments in climate, clean energy and environmental justice into law. These investments will save families $500 a year on energy bills, provide greater economic stability, and protect our national and climate security. We must break our dependence on dirty, dangerous and unreliable fossil fuels.</p>

<p><strong>Lori Lodes, Executive Director, Climate Power: </strong>&#8220;Tonight, President Biden laid out his plan to provide relief for American families that have been living in a world in flux – a plan that will grow the economy, lower household costs, create jobs and address environmental injustices by investing in clean energy and tackling the climate crisis. Clean energy is the future of our economy.</p>



<p>&#8220;We can and must take these steps now to lower energy costs, provide energy independence and secure our nation. Instead of keeping the American economy tethered to fossil fuels that makes us dependent on the ambitions of authoritarian leaders and the greed of oil and gas CEOs, let’s invest in a clean energy economy built right here in America.</p>



<p>&#8220;Tackling climate action is a huge opportunity for our nation – cutting household energy costs by $500 and saving families another $80 a month at the pump. We can speed up the production of cheap, clean and reliable energy that’s made in America. We’ll create millions of new good-paying jobs by investing in wind, solar and other clean energy sources that won’t run out.</p>

Investing in clean energy, in clean air and water, and in a safe, livable climate will create millions of jobs, help address inflation, and build a better America. The House of Representatives has taken action; it’s past time the Senate passes legislation investing in climate, jobs, and justice too. But the work cannot end there – Washington must invest in our democracy. The John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to Vote Act are more important than ever. And the Senate must confirm President Biden’s nominee to the Supreme Court: Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. It’s time Washington addresses the interlocking crises we face and invests in the people, our democracy, and the country.

<h3>Gun Violence Prevention Advocates:</h3>



<p><strong>John Feinblatt, President, Everytown for Gun Safety: “</strong>During his first year in office, President Biden has led the strongest gun safety administration we’ve seen, and this speech is further proof that he remains fully committed to keeping Americans safe from gun violence.

<p><strong>Shannon Watts, Founder, Moms Demand Action: </strong>“President Biden showed the leadership we need to unify our country and save lives. As a candidate, Joe Biden ran on the strongest gun safety platform in history and his Administration continues to follow through on that promise.

<p><strong>Kris Brown, President, Brady:</strong> “We are heartened by President Biden’s words tonight, but we need continued and increased action and attention to ending America’s gun violence crisis. President Biden has already taken extensive and historic action, but he cannot let up. He also cannot solve this problem alone. His calls for legislative fixes such as universal background checks, banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, and repealing PLCAA, the liability shield for gun manufacturers, are common-sense and will save lives. Congress must also pass the $200 million for community violence interventions the President has asked for in Fiscal Year 2022 appropriations, and the proposed investment of $5 billion over eight years that was included in the Build Back Better Act, arguably the largest investment in gun violence prevention ever. Over 81 million Americans voted for President Biden because of his ability to handle the many problems facing our nation. He and Congress must not let the crisis that kills over 100 Americans every day fall to the wayside. His speech tonight reiterated his commitment to this issue tonight. We need him to remain steadfast and to make gun violence an even greater priority in the year ahead.” [<a href="https://www.bradyunited.org/press-releases/biden-state-of-the-union-gun-violence-continue-action-2022">Statement</a>, 3/1/22]</p>

<p><strong>Jo Ann Jenkins, CEO, AARP:</strong> “AARP is encouraged that President Biden continues to urge Congress to act on our nation’s skyrocketing prescription drug prices. If the prices for household goods grew as fast as drug prices over the last 15 years, gas would now cost $12.20 a gallon and milk would be $13 a gallon. For all those years, politicians made promises to lower drug prices, but they just kept going up. Allowing Medicare to negotiate the price it pays for prescription drugs will help protect seniors from inflation by lowering their drug prices and putting money back in their pockets. This policy proposal is strongly supported by vast majorities of Democratic, Independent and Republican voters.</p>



<p>&nbsp;“How much longer will older Americans be forced to wait for the Senate to lower drug prices? Now is the time to get the job done. We urge the Senate to keep their promises to voters and lower drug prices, reduce seniors’ drug costs, and save taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars.</p>



<p>“We were also encouraged to hear the President describe new actions to ensure that residents in nursing homes will receive the safe, high-quality care they deserve. For years, AARP and AARP Foundation have sounded the alarm about problems in America’s nursing homes. The COVID-19 pandemic exposed the chronic, ongoing issues with our long-term care system and emphasized the need for reform. It is a national disgrace that more than 200,000 residents and staff in nursing homes and other long-term care facilities died. AARP urges the federal government to act swiftly to ensure minimum staffing standards, increase transparency, and hold nursing homes accountable when they do not provide quality care.” [<a href="https://press.aarp.org/2022-3-1-AARP-CEO-Jo-Ann-Jenkins-Responds-to-State-of-the-Union">Statement</a>, 3/1/22]</p>

<p><strong>David Mitchell, Founder, Patients For Affordable Drugs Now: </strong>“Tonight, President Biden once again called for legislation to lower prescription drug prices, including Medicare negotiation. For two decades, Americans have been targeted by drug companies that established a system that prevents our government from negotiating on our behalf. It is imperative that the Senate pass a package of reforms that will couple copay and out-of-pocket caps with provisions that drive down prices by empowering Medicare to negotiate lower prices and limiting year-to-year price increases to truly lower costs — not just shift them around. Otherwise, Americans will wind up paying more through higher premiums and taxes.</p>



<p>“With inflation at record levels and Americans facing rising costs, Big Pharma’s price gouging forces Americans to pay almost four times what people in other nations pay for the same brand-name drugs. The drug price reforms from the House-passed Build Back Better package allow Medicare to negotiate lower prices, curb Big Pharma’s price gouging, cap out-of-pocket costs, and deliver long overdue relief to millions of Americans. The reforms have the support of all 50 Democratic senators, offering a clear path to passage through reconciliation. The provisions are the most popular element of the original package, and more than 90 percent of voters list drug pricing reform as a top issue for the midterms.</p>



<p>“It is time for the Senate to advance a reconciliation package with these drug price reforms. Americans need help now.” [Statement, 3/1/22]</p>

This blueprint could not come at a more auspicious time, as our nation and our young people in particular are experiencing a mental health crisis. This plan is transformative and we urge Congress to get behind all the elements in this plan, invest substantially in critical research, and enact the measures needed to make it a reality. We must also remember the tireless work of mental health practitioners during the pandemic and the need to remove the administrative obstacles that can prevent them from providing services to people who most need their help.” [Statement, 3/1/22]</p>

<h3>Labor Leaders</h3>



<p><strong>Ray Curry, President, United Auto Workers:</strong> <strong>“</strong>Under President Biden’s leadership, we have seen unprecedented job growth and rising wages. The President has directly confronted the coronavirus pandemic that has taken lives of almost nine hundred and fifty thousand of our fellow citizens. Through his leadership, we are now better protected, and the number of infections is declining. Of course, challenges remain and there is more work to do. Congress must act on the President’s priorities. For starters, the Senate should pass the PRO Act and Confirm Ketanji Brown Jackson to the highest court in the land. Together with the Biden Administration, we are working to ensure that the transition to electric vehicles supports good union jobs by passing the Stabenow/Kildee electric vehicle tax credit and complementary policies into law. We are working together to strengthen our supply chain, so we no longer face a crippling chip shortage that has hurt our members&nbsp;who&nbsp;build&nbsp;consumer vehicles, Heavy Truck&nbsp;vehicles and Agricultural and Construction Equipment. By laying out this agenda, President Biden offers a clear path forward that builds America back better than ever. UAW and working families need lower prescription drug costs and more affordable quality healthcare, so no one is forced to choose between putting food on the table and affording life-saving drugs or going to the doctor. We must make childcare affordable, so parents can work knowing their children are safe. Equally important to UAW members and working families are the attacks on our democracy occurring across our country as falsehoods about the 2020 election continue to spread, and dozens of states enact restrictive voting laws that threaten to disenfranchise lawful citizens from the ballot. It is troubling that legislation to protect our most fundamental democratic rights as voters was filibustered in the Senate. Make no mistake – these attacks do more than threaten an idea of democracy; they cripple the foundation that grants our members their right to organize and secure higher standards of living for themselves and their families. Finally, President Biden addressed the unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, which is an affront to all democratic forms of government and all people of goodwill. We stand with President Biden and our allies in defending the hardworking families of Ukraine and their democracy. It is long past time we unite to address these issues as a country. The UAW is prepared to work with Congress and the Biden Administration to meet this moment as we have throughout our history.” [<a href="https://uaw.org/statement-uaw-president-ray-curry-president-bidens-state-union-address/">Statement</a>, 3/1/22]</p>



<p><strong>Jimmy Williams, President, IUPAT:</strong> “President Biden continued his strong advocacy for the working class tonight during his State of the Union Address. The President’s focus on bread and butter issues for the IUPAT member, such as passing the Protecting the Right to Organize Act (PRO Act), expanding registered apprenticeship programs, and creating a comprehensive paid family and medical leave program are a breath of fresh air. And our union stands ready from coast to coast to work on projects which are funded by the historic infrastructure package recently signed into law by President Biden, the largest infrastructure bill passed in our nation’s history. His determination to lower inflation, raise working standards, and give every worker the opportunity to join or form a union shows his strong commitment to creating an economy that works for all. Now is the time for the US Congress to do their job and get these bills to his desk. The President is echoing what IUPAT members have known for a long time: when we have an economy that works for working people, our nation thrives.” [<a href="https://www.iupat.org/news/statement-2022-sotu/">Statement</a>, 3/1/22]</p>



<p><strong>Randi Weingarten, President, American Federation of Teachers:</strong> “Tonight, Joe Biden proved why Americans were right to elect him as president. He met a moment in history with gravity and empathy. He urged unity to recover from the immense economic challenges of the pandemic, with a laser focus on boosting wages and cutting costs to help American families recover and thrive. And he made the case against the threat posed by autocrats and those who excuse them, both here and abroad. Democracy and freedom are worth fighting for—as the Ukrainian people are showing us every day.The president laid out just how far we’ve come in a year—from closed schools, millions of COVID-19 cases and soaring unemployment, to record growth, jobs, vaccines and the return of reliable and safe in-person learning. But we are still dealing with the pandemic’s terrible effects, and the president outlined a plan to curb prices, increase pay and create a better economy that puts American workmanship and creativity front and center and American workers first. We commend his specific, practical measures that would reduce costs for families right now, including child care, pre-K and prescription drugs. And we echo the need to take rapid action on climate change after yesterday’s U.N. warning that the world is at a tipping point. Our members are on the frontlines of the pandemic, and we were honored to have progressive care unit nurse Refynd Duro of Ohio in the audience with the first lady tonight. Our healthcare heroes know what it will take to emerge stronger and healthier. The health, well-being and academic recovery of students is every teacher’s priority, and the pandemic has multiplied the stresses and strains on us all. We share the president’s concerns over the mental health crisis facing our young people, including the negative effects of unbridled social media because we live with the fallout every day. Our journey will be difficult, but our direction is clear. And with the president’s leadership, now is the time to broaden the tent—to unify and organize for a better life for all Americans and to fight for and defend democracy, at home and around the world.” [<a href="https://www.aft.org/press-release/afts-weingarten-president-bidens-state-union-address">Statement</a>, 3/1/22]</p>



<p><strong>Chris Shelton, President, CWA:</strong> In his first State of the Union address, President Biden made it clear that creating jobs through investment in our country’s infrastructure and empowering workers has been the foundation of his agenda to strengthen our country. CWA commends President Biden for presenting a clear plan to improve the lives of working families, boost our economy and address rising costs. We agree that Congress must pass legislation to reduce prescription drug, health care and child care costs and to make higher education more affordable and that this can be done by making sure that corporations and the wealthiest Americans start paying their fair share. As union members, we know that overcoming the relentless and coordinated corporate attack on workers’ rights is a difficult task and there is much left to be done. President Biden left no doubt that he believes that every worker in every state must have a free and fair choice to organize or join a union, and the right to bargain collectively with their employer, without fear of intimidation, coercion, threats, and anti-union propaganda. He also pointed out the insufficiency of our current labor laws, calling on Congress to pass the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act. CWA applauds President Biden’s focus on worker empowerment and we will continue to support the Administration in its effort to create more good union jobs, support workers’ organizing for better pay and working conditions and reform weak and outdated labor laws.

<p><strong>Marc Perrone, President, UFCW:</strong> “Working Americans are rightly concerned about the state of the world. While the country is thankfully emerging from the latest wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, it now faces another global crisis with Russia’s invasion into Ukraine. Tonight, President Biden laid out a clear plan to provide relief to hard-working Americans and their families by reducing costs and eliminating barriers to good jobs. Currently, the U.S. is seeing one of the strongest labor markets in recent history but many workers still face hurdles when it comes to accessing good-paying jobs that can support a family. As the nation’s largest private sector union, UFCW strongly endorses President Biden’s initiatives to increase access to apprenticeships and training, support paycheck fairness, provide paid family and medical leave, and protect workers’ rights to join a union. We believe this – along with plans to protect consumers and reduce the cost of everyday expenses – will provide working families with the ability to build better lives they have earned and deserve. UFCW calls on Congress to take immediate action to move these crucial initiatives forward.” [<a href="https://www.ufcw.org/press-releases/following-the-state-of-the-union-ufcw-echoes-president-bidens-call-to-improve-the-lives-of-working-people/">Statement</a>, 3/1/22]</p>

<p><strong>Greg Regan, President, TTD:</strong> “From the passage of the American Rescue Plan to the biggest investment in infrastructure in&nbsp;our nation’s&nbsp;history, the first year of the Biden Administration was a capstone year of legislative victories for transportation labor unions and working people.

We welcome the progress of the White House Task Force on Worker Organizing and Empowerment, which recently released a&nbsp;report&nbsp;outlining 70 recommendations to empower workers, including an initiative to increase worker awareness of their federally protected rights to organize and establish a resource center for information on unions and collective bargaining. We urge Congress to heed the President’s call to pass the Richard L.

We look forward to continuing to work with President Biden and the Administration to create good union jobs, invest in America’s transportation infrastructure, and expand collective bargaining for every transportation worker in the nation.” [<a href="https://ttd.org/news-and-media/transportation-labor-reacts-to-bidens-state-of-the-union-address/">Statement</a>, 3/1/22]</p>

<p><strong>Lee Saunders, President, AFSCME:</strong> “When President Joe Biden took office, COVID cases were soaring. Millions of Americans had lost their jobs. The unemployment rate was well above 6%, and states and local governing bodies were on the brink of budget crises. America has seen a dramatic reversal. Today, we are diminishing COVID’s impact on our lives through science. America is hiring again. And best of all, working people have more power than ever, bolstered by an administration that supports their right to organize and strike to demand better pay, benefits and working conditions. How did President Biden get America back on track? He listened to working people and then he delivered. When public service workers — the everyday heroes who have kept our communities running throughout the pandemic — had their jobs threatened by budget cuts, President Biden showed leadership. By signing the American Rescue Plan, he brought our public services back from the brink, saving jobs and preventing waves of layoffs. He signed an infrastructure bill that is making historic investments in our roads, bridges, water systems and broadband. He has chosen Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, a jurist with an indisputable record of standing with working people, as the first African American woman ever nominated to the Supreme Court. He has rebuilt the federal judiciary with a diversity never seen before, whether measured by professional background or by race and gender. And with a revamped and empowered National Labor Relations Board, workers can finally be confident that their rights will be safeguarded, following four years in which they were gutted or just ignored. But the State of the Union can’t just be about achievements so far; tonight’s speech must answer the question of what comes next. We must advance the rights and freedoms of both public and private sector workers by passing the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act and the Public Service Freedom to Negotiate Act. We must finally allow Medicare to negotiate lower prescription drug prices, invest in child care to support working families and providers alike, curb climate change before it’s too late and ensure that the ultra-wealthy and large corporations pay their fair share in taxes so we can make investments in strong communities. And finally, our democracy is under attack. We must respond in kind by protecting the right of every citizen to cast a ballot and make it easier to vote. The foundation of our nation depends on it. Working people want this administration to level the playing field and deliver more fundamental change. Now is the time to get it done.” [<a href="https://www.afscme.org/press/releases/2022/saunders-on-state-of-the-union-america-has-seen-a-dramatic-reversal-working-people-have-more-power-than-ever-now-is-the-time-to-deliver-fundamental-change">Statement</a>, 3/1/22]</p>

The president’s first year in office has already resulted in major victories, including the passage of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the creation of the White House Task Force on Worker Organizing and Empowerment. These initiatives will help ensure good-paying union jobs for millions of American workers in the years to come. While the recent events in Ukraine clearly highlight our need to focus on foreign as well as domestic priorities, we must remember that to be strong around the world, we must first be strong at home. That means bolstering domestic supply chains for vital goods, providing education and job training to ensure that manufacturers have the skilled workers they need, building up our health care system, passing labor protections like the PRO Act and extending benefits like paid family and medical leave to all workers. The president today laid out an ambitious agenda that will make our nation more secure, provide good-paying jobs to millions of workers, support struggling families, keep rising prices under control and ensure that communities will continue to thrive for generations to come.

When he says that we need to strengthen our supply chains by making more things in America it is not just empty rhetoric. He has already taken executive action to close loopholes in existing Made in America requirements. Funds from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will facilitate economic development by improving our transportation capacity and bringing high-speed internet connections to communities across the country while creating good jobs in the industry.</p>

The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will create even more good jobs, while investing in our aging airports, public transit systems and more. But as the President said tonight, there is far more work to be done. As the Russian invasion of Ukraine makes even more clear, we must immediately strengthen our domestic supply chains, especially in the defense industry. We must take measures to lower consumer prices, broaden access to apprenticeship programs, create a national paid family and medical leave program, and protect our sacred right to vote.

<p><strong>LABOR: Eric Dean, President, Ironworkers</strong>: In his speech, President Biden did not shy away from the challenges and uncertainty that many Americans are living with. But his words remind us that America has overcome challenges before through unity and determination. The president highlighted his administration’s initiatives that meet the country’s challenges head-on and bring us together. The American Rescue Plan offered a lifeline to working people during the middle of the pandemic. The ARP kept state governments afloat and their infrastructure funds full, preserving and creating thousands of ironworker jobs. The Rescue Plan’s investments powered the recovery that has kept unemployment low all the way to today.The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is a historic investment that will transform America’s transportation, water and energy systems for the better. The ongoing rollout promises good union jobs and opportunity for every community in America. The bipartisan majorities that passed the law in both houses of Congress are proof that we can still work together. President Biden emphasized his administration’s substantial focus on domestic manufacturing as an important tool to create jobs, secure supply chains and lower costs. Since Biden entered office, the Iron Workers have seen an explosion of investment in factories for semiconductors, electric vehicles and other manufactured goods. The administration’s policies will foster and expand this manufacturing renaissance. The Iron Workers support these and other policies to help working-class Americans and will continue to work with the administration to help them succeed. This is an opportunity to reflect on the past year’s achievements and plan to meet the challenges of the present. If we are united, as a union and as Americans, there is nothing we cannot accomplish.” [<a href="http://www.ironworkers.org/news-magazine/news/2022/03/02/iron-workers-salute-president-biden-s-state-of-the-union-message">Statement</a>, 3/2/22]</p>

We appreciate that the president also articulated his commitment to a stronger recovery, despite the obstacles and challenges in Congress. Latinos and our country cannot afford to return to the pre-pandemic status quo of entrenched social and economic disparities. Our nation’s 62 million Latinos need continuing support from the president and from Congress to improve the lives and futures of their children and families, including—among other things—the expanded Child Tax Credit, targeted mental health services, improved health care, nutrition services, quality education, affordable housing, and access to better jobs. And the Senate should heed the president’s call to immediately pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to Vote Act. Finally, we commend the president for making the moral and economic case for a path to citizenship for Dreamers, farmworkers, TPS holders, essential workers and many other immigrants who have stood up for America during the pandemic, which will only make America stronger. The vast majority of Americans agree. These workers play a key role in fueling our economic recovery, and legalizing immigrant workers with deep family and economic ties to the United States will reduce labor shortages and supply chain bottlenecks. The proof of the president’s commitment, though, will be in his actions following these remarks, including using his own executive authority to act on behalf of immigrant essential workers, should Congress fail to act.” [<a href="https://www.unidosus.org/press-releases/biden-2022-state-of-the-union-unidosus-statement/">Statement</a>, 3/1/22]</p>

<p><strong>Frankie Miranda, President and CEO, Hispanic Federation:</strong> “Hispanic Federation applauds President Biden&#8217;s accomplishments in his first year as President. We recognize that he is leading the nation through one of the most challenging foreign and domestic policy moments in decades. In the last year, his accomplishments have been significant. More American jobs have been created in one year than at any time in U.S. history. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act is rebuilding America&#8217;s roads, bridges, and rails and increasing access to clean drinking water and high-speed internet. The American Rescue Plan provided pandemic and economic relief by lowering taxes on the middle class and expanding social infrastructures through programs like the expanded Child Tax Credit, Unemployment Insurance, and SNAP. The Biden administration also began unraveling the destructive Trump-era laws targeting immigrants and refugees and rebuilding America&#8217;s reputation abroad. Most recently, the choice of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, the first Black woman to be nominated to the Supreme Court, signals the continued priority of inclusiveness in his administration and his judicial nominees.” [<a href="https://preview.hispanicfederation.org/media/press_releases/the_state_of_the_union_is_strong_but_serious_latino_issues_persist/">Statement</a>, 3/1/22]</p>

<p><strong>Arturo Vargas, CEO, National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials (NALEO)</strong>: “Over the past few years, the world has lived through a series of unprecedented historic events that have affected us globally, as a nation, as comunidades, and as individuals.&nbsp; Understandably, these events have brought us together in some ways but further divided us in others. Just when we were beginning to see the light at the end of the tunnel on COVID-19, Russia started an unprovoked war in Ukraine.&nbsp; Tonight, as the president said, our hearts are with the Ukrainian people.&nbsp; While this war is being waged overseas, its fundamental implications for human rights and access to a fair and representative democracy ring close to home. During President Biden’s first year in office, NALEO was thrilled to see the instances where Republicans and Democrats came together to make life better for all Americans. We encourage the White House to continue its people-before-politics work, particularly in the areas of immigration reform and naturalization, voting rights, and continued COVID-19 health and safety precautions.&nbsp; Our leaders must put American values, the common good, and humanity before hubris, crafting legislation that extends beyond party lines. We commend the president for reiterating the critical importance of the right to vote and the invaluable contributions that immigrants make to our society — from our economy to our global status as a nation that advances liberty and justice for all.” [<a href="https://naleo.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/3_1_22_-_NALEO_Release_-_Biden_SOTU_-_Final.pdf">Statement</a>, 3/1/22]</p>

His leadership in the passage of the $1.2 trillion Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the single-largest investment in our nation’s transportation system in our lifetime, exemplifies his determination to create good union jobs and build the middle-class. While the pandemic has posed incredible challenges for our economy and the very health and well-being of ourselves and our families, this Administration is acting with decisiveness and determination to confront inflation, restore our economy, ensure Americans have access to vaccines and testing, and reduce child poverty to historic lows.&nbsp; The President also laid out his vision to fix our broken immigration system and provide a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers and TPS-holders. LIUNA urges Congress to act on the President’s proposals and provide relief to hundreds of thousands of hard-working immigrant families – many of whom are union members, working in the construction industry. LIUNA commends the Biden Administration for prioritizing the needs of working men and women by reversing anti-worker policies, and implementing worker-friendly, union-friendly initiatives. With more good union jobs, a stronger, more robust economy, and a federal government committed to allowing workers the right to join unions, LIUNA members look forward to standing shoulder to shoulder with the President and his Administration to continue this impressive momentum.&#8221; [Statement, 3/2/22]</p>

Rainbows for All Children supports President Biden’s strategy to:“build system capacity, connect more people to care, and provide support to Americans.” The President’s plan specifically outlines support in regards to our nation’s youth, which are in desperate need of increased mental health care. All children deserve access to high-quality, affordable, and culturally competent mental health care. Approximately 68% of children living in the United States (or 50 million children) will experience a life-altering event triggering profound grief before they turn 18 (known as an Adverse Childhood Experience). This including death in the family, divorce, abandonment, military deployment of a loved one, incarceration, or diagnosis of a life-threatening illness. These children are at an increased risk for learning, emotional, and behavioral issues; physical health problems; aggression; and substance and alcohol abuse. These statistics have not been updated to recognize the over 203,649 children who have experienced the loss of a parent or caregiver to the COVID-19 pandemic, and time will only tell how our children will respond to the shared trauma of the pandemic. Children often do not have the ability to cope with their feelings and experiences around a traumatic event or a loss. A child’s reactions to Adverse Childhood Experiences can interfere with their daily life and ability to function and interact with others. Symptoms can include nightmares, depression, physical symptoms such as stomachaches and headaches, self-harm, insomnia, fatigue, appetite disturbances, abrupt changes in personality, poor emotional control, lack of motivation, substance abuse, truancy, academic problems, peer problems, anxiety, and more. Other children may hide their emotions, acting as though nothing has happened. Long-term effects can continue to surface for decades to come. Research has shown that Adverse Childhood Experiences are strongly related to the development and prevalence of a wide range of behavioral and health problems throughout a person’s lifespan, including substance abuse, mental health issues, depression, obesity, learning and behavioral issues, aggression, and more.However, the negative effects of Adverse Childhood Experiences are preventable, and children can learn coping skills to help them develop greater resiliency, which President Biden’s addresses in his unity agenda. Assuring the healthy development of all children is essential for societies seeking to achieve their full health and potential. Finding early remedies to shared trauma and loss is critical to the flourishing of our communities. We all need to work harder to promote conditions that reduce or eliminate risky behavior and develop healthy children. The founder of Rainbows, Suzy Yehl Marta, said that she, “would never stop until every grieving child had a voice.” We are committed to ensuring her mission lives on with the same compassion and commitment, providing guided peer support to youth throughout 38 states and 12 countries at no cost to the children or families we serve.” [Statement, 3/1/22]</p>



<p><strong>Schroeder Stribling, President and CEO, Mental Health America: </strong>“Mental Health America applauds President Biden for highlighting mental health in tonight’s State of the Union and calling for all Americans to have access to the mental health services they need. We had a pre-existing mental health crisis in America before COVID-19 which the pandemic has dramatically amplified. After two years of grief, loss, and isolation, Americans are in desperate need of more mental health supports and services. The strategy the White House has laid out in its fact sheet is a necessary beginning – and it will save lives. Their approach will meet people where they are and will reduce disparities and promote equity across the mental health landscape. Advancing equity in mental health requires that everyone – regardless of race, socioeconomic status, gender identity or sexual orientation, geography, or any other demographic – has equal access to affordable, effective, and culturally responsive mental health care. Through peer support, workforce expansion, and social and human services provider training, we are excited to see the Biden administration empowering community members to take an active role in providing mental health support. The overwhelming need for mental health support in this country cannot be met by the current workforce alone. More than 50% of people will be diagnosed with a mental health condition at some point in their lifetime, and many will not receive any services until many years after first experiencing symptoms. To that end, we appreciate the administration&#8217;s focus on prevention and early intervention, including a commitment to early childhood and school services and a more proactive approach to social media.As more of the plan unfolds, we hope to see a fierce dedication to mental health reforms in our public and private insurance programs. We look forward to working with the administration on this new mental health agenda.” [<a href="https://www.mhanational.org/statement-president-bidens-state-union-remarks-regarding-mental-health">Statement</a>, 3/1/22]</p>



<p><strong>Daniel H.

From expanding our mental health workforce and reimagining our response to mental health crises to increasing access to care and supporting the mental health of our youth and young adults, the President is proposing bold investments in our mental health infrastructure. These investments and policy solutions could not come at a more critical time. As our mental health crisis continues to intensify at an alarming rate, we must put bipartisan, common-sense solutions into practice. We thank the President for his leadership in advancing this effort and we call upon Congress to pass legislation meeting the nation’s mental health needs.” [<a href="https://nami.org/Press-Media/Press-Releases/2022/NAMI-Applauds-President-Biden-s-Focus-on-Mental-Health-in-the-State-of-the-Union-Address">Statement</a>, 3/1/22]</p>

We celebrate the inclusion of the Peer Support Workforce in the Administration’s strategy. We stand ready to partner with the Biden administration on improving the health of all Americans including through policy related to the peer support profession.” [Statement, 3/1/22]</p>



<p><strong>American Association of Suicidology (AAS)</strong>: “The American Association of Suicidology (AAS) expresses its gratitude to the Biden Administration for taking action to address a number of critical mental health initiatives and specifically addressing suicide in this bold, inclusive, and comprehensive agenda. In 2018, we called on legislators and lawmakers to fully fund suicide prevention at $1 billion annually – this public health-oriented agenda is finally on par with that request and makes huge strides in meeting the scope of the problem head on. AAS has consistently advocated for youth mental health programs and progressive initiatives that allow young people in the US to access life-saving care. Additionally, it’s promising to see this Administration directly tackle the difficult issue of the intersection of social media with the behavioral health of youth. While social media also carries many advantages in allowing youth to connect with their peers and to provide support, we’re happy to see the Administration target data collection and other examples of users’ digital shadows that can lead to potential harm to this vulnerable population. At the beginning of the pandemic, AAS highlighted the importance of behavioral health for our frontline and healthcare workers and we praise the President for signing the bipartisan Dr. Lorna Breen Health Care Provider Protection Act into law “which will invest $135 million over three years into training health care providers on suicide prevention and behavioral health while launching an awareness campaign to address stigmatization, promote help-seeking and self-care among this workforce.” Again, we applaud the Administration in directly addressing the crisis infrastructure in this country and for fully appreciating the scope of the problem, including prevention, intervention, and outreach across the full continuum of care. Over the last few years, AAS has consistently played a role in developing legislation to further advance the creation and implementation of 988. AAS is the home of many members in the crisis services industry as well as providing accreditation for over a hundred crisis centers taking part in the 988 and National Suicide Prevention Lifeline network. As such, we’ve strongly advocated for funding crisis centers to fully provide the capacity to meet the demand of the impending volume of contacts through 988. This Administration’s agenda takes another major step in the direction of ensuring this will take place and we could not be more grateful. We look forward to continuing to collaborate with this Administration and other suicide prevention and mental health organizations to reduce suicides in this country.” [Statement, 3/1/22]</p>



<p><strong>Eating Disorders Coalition:</strong>&nbsp;&#8220;Social media has fueled the pediatric mental health crisis and has been conducting a “national experiment” on our children for years. Platform algorithms knowingly promote harmful eating disorders and other mental health content to youth in return for boosted engagement and profits. Sadly, social media platforms have increasingly taken advantage of youth during the pandemic as isolation has spawned increased social media usage. In particular, social media algorithms have placed extreme eating disorder, depression, and self-harm content next to youth-targeted advertising and served these messages to vulnerable users to maximize engagement and spending. Frequent and prolonged social media use has been correlated with depressed mood and negative appearance comparison in youth, leading to increased risk of disordered eating. These impacts have been reflected in eating disorder emergency room hospitalizations for teen girls increasing by 50% since 2019.1 While sharing steps to address the effects of social media platform predation, President Biden will also focus on preventive action to create accountability for social media platforms under the administration’s existing authority.&#8221; [<a href="http://eatingdisorderscoalition.org.s208556.gridserver.com/couch/uploads/file/sotu-press-release-3.pdf">Statement</a>, 3/1/22]&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Jim Steyer, Founder and CEO, Common Sense: </strong>“The significance of the President’s State of the Union message about our national mental health crisis cannot be overstated. Kids and teens are suffering from mental health issues at alarming rates, exacerbated by the pandemic and also by social media platforms that have seized the opportunity to keep kids addicted to screens at all costs. The American people want to see the government act to protect them and their children. If Congress and the President work together now to, as the president called for, strengthen children’s privacy and ban targeted advertising for children online, stop discriminatory algorithmic decision-making that limits opportunities for young Americans, and invest in research on social media’s mental harms, it would be a game-changer for creating a better and safer online world for kids, teens, and all consumers.” [Statement, 3/1/22]</p>

By prioritizing these areas and more, we can bridge the dangerous divide between mental health and physical health, and benefit society for years to come. We applaud President Biden and his administration for shining a much-needed spotlight on the mental health crisis and we call on every member of Congress to act with great urgency.” [<a href="https://www.thekennedyforum.org/press-releases/joint-statement-from-former-congressman-patrick-j-kennedy-and-amy-kennedy-on-white-house-strategy-to-address-mental-health-crisis/">Statemen</a>t, 3/2/2022]</p>

<h3>Progressives</h3>



<p><strong>Danielle Melfi, Executive Director, Building Back Together: </strong>“Tonight, President Biden made clear that even as we faced unprecedented crises in the last year, America is stronger and more resilient today than we were when he took office. In his speech, the President emphasized America’s leadership in rallying our allies to stand up for democracy and with the Ukrainian people by enacting swift and severe costs on Russia in the face of Putin’s premeditated war. President Biden also highlighted the significant steps the Biden-Harris Administration has taken to combat the COVID-19 pandemic and build our economy from the bottom up and the middle out — not the top down. Under President Biden’s leadership, we have the tools to keep Americans safe and fight COVID-19, have laid the groundwork for a historic economic recovery that has already created millions of jobs, and have leaders in the White House who are using every tool at their disposal to bring down costs for working families. Through the American Rescue Plan, the Biden-Harris Administration secured relief funding to get shots in arms, safely reopen schools, and get Americans back to work. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which President Biden signed into law in November, is already delivering much-needed investments to create good-paying jobs rebuilding America with goods that are made in America. And the President is just getting started. Along with these historic accomplishments, President Biden underscored the importance of unity as we turn to the work that lies ahead. He knows, as we do, that there is more that unites us than divides us, and that there is nothing Americans can’t do when we do it together. As the President said tonight, ‘It is never a good bet to bet against the American people.’ In the coming months, working and middle class Americans can trust that the Biden-Harris Administration will continue to build on the progress made so far and rebuild a stronger America for all of us.” [Statement, 3/1/22]</p>

The President also recognizes that corporations and the wealthiest Americans, who have seen their gains skyrocket during the pandemic, can do more to pay their fair share of taxes and support expanded access to health care and other services that help average families make ends meet.President Biden has delivered on his promises to increase access to affordable health care, create jobs and update basic infrastructure like roads, broadband and water systems in his first year as president. As many as 5 million more Americans have gained access to health care, COVID-19 tests and vaccines have been distributed widely, and families around the country have received much-needed financial relief payments. What’s more, the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act he signed will further boost our economy and provide long-overdue improvements in transportation, clean air and water and the expansion of telehealth services that make doctor’s appointments and treatments more convenient and accessible. Congress should finish the job by passing the rest of President Biden’s broadly popular proposals to negotiate lower prescription drug prices, close the Medicaid coverage gap and make affordable health care premiums permanent.” [<a href="https://www.healthcareforamericanow.org/bidens-sotu-proposals-will-tackle-inflation-by-lowering-health-care-costs-for-families">Statement,</a> 3/1/22]</p>

<h3>Women and Families Advocates</h3>



<p><strong>Kristin Rowe-Finkbeiner, Executive Director and CEO, MomsRising: </strong>“At this time when the country’s moms and families are struggling with the pandemic, fast-rising prices, and our need to create the kind of care infrastructure every country needs, we are very pleased to learn President Biden will take time during his State of the Union address tomorrow night to discuss the importance of lowering families’ costs – including child care, pre-K, and prescription drugs – and adopting a comprehensive national paid leave program, as well as ensuring paycheck fairness, raising the minimum wage, and providing direct tax relief to struggling families. These are the policies that matter most to America’s moms because they support economic security and stability for families, strengthen businesses, and help our economy thrive. President Biden and Vice President Harris are delivering the leadership America’s moms want and need. The U.S. Senate must step up now. For America’s moms, care simply can’t wait any longer.” [<a href="https://www.momsrising.org/newsroom/this-is-the-leadership-americas-moms-want-and-need">Statement</a>, 3/1/22]</p>



<p><strong>Alexis McGill Johnson, President, Planned Parenthood: </strong>“As state legislatures across the country escalate relentless attacks on abortion rights and the Supreme Court gearing up to rule on a case this spring that could overturn Roe v. Wade, we need President Biden and all our leaders to step up and fight back. We thank the president for making important calls tonight to protect reproductive, LGBTQ+ and voting rights, advance maternal health, expand health care access, and to confirm Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court. Now is the time to be as bold and strong as possible. We are at a breaking point for reproductive freedom, and we need lawmakers at all levels of government to act. There is no more time to waste.” [Statement, 3/1/22]</p>



<p><strong>Sarah Rittling, Executive Director, First Five Years Fund (FFYF): </strong>“The president’s message tonight was clear: child care and early learning should be included in whatever reconciliation package Congress sends to his desk for signature. President Biden understands that the high cost and limited supply of child care and pre-K has held working families back for too long. We have an opportunity to provide relief to parents and build an early learning system that meets the needs of families, providers, and our economy. So as we think about addressing today’s challenges and building a stronger economic future for this country, there’s no question that early care and education must be central to the conversation. It’s time we address America’s early learning crisis head on to ensure children have the opportunity to start kindergarten ready to learn, and parents know that they can contribute to our economic recovery without the added worry of whether they find quality, affordable care for their children. The good news is that we have never been closer to passing strong, federal legislation to fortify America’s child care and early learning sector. We F look forward to continuing to work with Congress and heed the President’s call this evening to enact these desperately-needed reforms and investments.” [Statement, 3/1/22]</p>



<p><strong>Jordan Brooks, Executive Director, United State of Women: </strong>“Today, the United State of Women feels heard. During the State of the Union address, the President showcased the progress we’ve made to emerge from this pandemic, and his deep commitment to continuing to build an economy and a country where women can succeed. In a time of crisis, he offered a message of unity and hope.&nbsp; Tonight, the President laid out a vision for our nation where childcare doesn’t break the bank, where everyone has paid family leave to take care of a child or loved one, and where we finally pass the Paycheck Fairness Act. In the face of unprecedented attacks on abortion access, the President reaffirmed his commitment to protecting and advancing reproductive justice and maternal health care. He urged Congress to pass critical legislation to extend the child tax credit, reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act, protect voting rights, and raise the minimum wage. As we said in our letter to Congress this week, women don’t live our lives in silos – we need all of these policies to build a country where women and families can thrive. We stand ready to work with the President and with Congress to get this agenda passed. The women, girls and families of our country are counting on us.” [Statement, 3/1/22]</p>



<p><strong>Miriam Calderón, Chief Policy&nbsp;Officer, ZERO TO THREE: </strong>“Tonight, before the nation, President Biden spoke directly to the importance of investing in our families and the care economy. For too long, parents have been burdened with painfully high child care costs while providers struggle to stay in business or care for their own families, have not had the paid leave they need to bond with their new baby or heal from childbirth, and have lacked access to the resources they need for their families to thrive. Families are consistently forced to make impossible choices between caring for young children or a loved one and putting food on the table. But as the President made clear tonight, we can and will fight to ensure that we are giving all families what they need to help their children thrive. We made great strides last year to support parents with young children through historic investments in child care and the expansion of the Child Tax Credit, but there is too much at stake to let up now. It is past time for Congress to reengage on these critical issues for our infants and toddlers, and we echo President Biden’s call for them to do so at once. Additionally, we were heartened to hear the President highlight the importance of mental health for all ages during tonight’s address. Our systems were not built with the mental health needs of babies and toddlers in mind. We look forward to working with the Administration and Congress to make certain that young children and their caregivers are at the center of this new plan.” [<a href="/www.zerotothree.org/resources/4319-early-childhood-advocates-praise-president-biden-for-highlighting-family-issues-during-state-of-the-union%3c">Statement</a>, 3/1/22]</p>



<p><strong>Marcela Howell, In Our Voice, National Black Women&#8217;s Reproductive Justice Agenda: </strong>“We were overjoyed on January 20, 2021, as we watched a new administration being sworn in. We voted for change and cheered when Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, a Black and Asian woman, were sworn in as president and vice president of the United States. We were looking forward to the changes that would help families thrive whether they lived in cities, suburbs, or rural areas. We applauded as President Biden took steps to restore civil and human rights that were weakened or destroyed by the last administration. But the president is not an island, he needs the support and partnership of Congress to effect deep-rooted and sustainable change. Instead, conservatives in Congress, especially in the U.S. Senate, have shamefully obstructed the president and his administration, particularly on civil and human rights initiatives.[<a href="https://blackrj.org/black-women-applaud-biden-harris-administrations-leadership-on-civil-and-human-rights-demand-congress-defend-the-constitution/">Statement,</a> 03/01/22]</p>



<p><strong>National Domestic Workers Alliance, Caring Across Generations, and Care in Action: </strong>“President Biden’s first State of the Union Address outlined in stark detail the challenges facing our country and concrete steps we can take towards a brighter future for working people. Now, it is critical that Congress do its part. The President’s plan to make a historic investment in the future of our care infrastructure has now been stalled in Congress for several months. Family caregivers and care workers are beyond exhausted physically, emotionally and financially and have had to duct-tape together care for their children, older family members and loved ones with disabilities. This investment will provide much-needed relief for home care workers who have sacrificed so much throughout the pandemic and the families who depend on their care. There are common sense steps Congress can take to lessen the economic pain that our country will face in the coming months. As President Biden outlined in his address, investing in workers and their families, lowering costs for families by investing in home and community based services, cutting childcare costs for families, and passing a federal paid leave policy are critical to an economy that works for all of us, not just the wealthy. It’s time for Congress to stand behind the President and realize the potential of an economy that centers care and allows all workers to provide for their families without the worry of making impossible choices.” [<a href="https://www.domesticworkers.org/press-releases/statement-on-president-joe-bidens-first-state-of-the-union-address">Joint statement</a>, 3/2/22]</p>



<p><strong>Mini Timmarju, President, NARAL: </strong>“President Biden’s State of the Union comes at a moment when the stakes for reproductive freedom could not be higher. The constitutional right to abortion is hanging on by a thread and state lawmakers across the country are determined to eviscerate abortion access through a barrage of bans and restrictions. It’s clear that the Biden-Harris administration recognizes that reproductive freedom is under attack and this moment requires bold action. We’re grateful that President Biden noted this pivotal moment for our movement during his address.” [<a href="https://www.prochoiceamerica.org/2022/03/01/naral-pro-choice-america-responds-to-president-bidens-state-of-the-union-address/">Statement</a>, 3/1/222]</p>



<p><strong>Amanda Brown Lierman, Executive Director, Supermajority: </strong>“Women are the backbone of our democracy. We came together across age, race, and background to vote President Biden into office with a mandate to prioritize the issues that we care about. We’ve raised our voices to demand paid leave, affordable child care, reproductive freedom, and voting rights. Tonight, President Biden made it clear that he will continue working to answer our call to build a better country for our daughters than the one we inherited. With the historic nomination of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court of the United States, President Biden took a giant step towards ensuring that our government represents us at every level. He fulfilled a crucial campaign promise to nominate a Black woman to our country’s highest court, and Judge Jackson will be a vital advocate for our rights on the bench. We are also heartened by his successful appointment of more than 40 federal judges, including numerous brilliant women, who represent the diversity of our country. We are encouraged by President Biden’s commitment to helping working families, which will provide women—especially women of color—relief we need to recover from the pandemic. We look forward to President Biden delivering for the millions of women who voted him into office by fulfilling his promise to work with Congress to lower costs for all Americans. We still have work to do. We will continue to push for paid leave, because no woman should have to choose between caring for herself or a loved one and earning a paycheck. We will continue to advocate for legislation protecting the freedom to vote, which is critical for the health of our democracy, our representation, and our progress. And we will keep fighting for our reproductive freedom, which has never been in greater danger. We will continue to demand a world where our lives, bodies, work, and families are valued and our government represents us. Women are the supermajority of voters in America, and we are powerful. We will not rest until our voices are heard and progress is made.” [Statement, 3/1/22]</p>

<p><strong>Kristin McGuire, Executive Director, Young Invicibles:</strong> “The President addressed the nation tonight with a backdrop of global crisis, but also one of national progress. The challenges we confront are ever-present. Our fight is a marathon, not a sprint, and today we reflected on our race toward progress and the work that lies ahead. It is undeniable the Biden Administration has made significant progress in the battle against the pandemic. Young Invincibles is proud to be a part of that nationwide effort with our Generation Vaxxed campaign. We were pleased to see the President highlight the measures the Administration and Congress have taken to expand access to health care, including tonight’s announcement on access to comprehensive care for mental health. Now it is time we make these changes permanent and cement our progress. A critically important theme of the President’s address was safeguarding democracy. We must remain committed to the fight to protect the vote. The future of young people and the nation depends on it.” [Statement, 3/1/22]</p>



<p><strong>Los Angeles Community College District (LACCD):&nbsp;</strong>&#8220;President Biden continues to be a stalwart supporter of higher education, and a true visionary for underserved students to attain a college degree and a leg up in the global economy. We echo his call for Congress to expand much-needed aid to Minority-Serving Institutions (MSIs), as well as his request to increase the maximum Pell Grant award by more than $2,000 to address the rising cost of college attendance. Bold moves like this promote college access and equity and help us build a more prosperous and inclusive future. We stand by, committed and ready to help the President advance his agenda forward.&#8221; [Statement, 3/1/22]&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>United Negro College Fund (UNCF):</strong> “In Tuesday’s State of the Union message, President Biden will call on Congress to increase funding for Pell Grants for students and funding specifically for historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs). The Biden administration will push for a $2,000 increase to the maximum for a Pell Grant, which is the nation’s effort to assist students coming from lower socio-economic backgrounds to fund their higher education pursuits. Increasing HBCU funding is a priority on which the Biden-Harris White House and UNCF have long collaborated. “This is a continuation of our shared goals,” said Dr. Michael L. Lomax, president and CEO of UNCF. “We have worked with this White House, even before they moved in, to formulate these asks. I applaud the president for including both HBCUs and a Pell Grant increase in his State of the Union address, and I hope both items will be championed by both sides of the aisle.”</p>



<p>“This is historic,” said Lodriguez V. Murray, senior vice president for public policy and government affairs at UNCF. “For the president of the United States to not only mention HBCUs in his State of the Union address, but to call for increased funding along with joining our effort to increase, and hopefully soon double the Pell Grant, is something we cannot help but be excited about. “It is rare in Washington for a leader to stand by priorities. It is rarer for HBCUs to be that priority. President Biden is really showing that he stands with students from vulnerable backgrounds and the institutions that best serve their needs, and those are HBCUs.&nbsp; UNCF hopes Congress will pass the FY 2022 appropriations bills at the highest levels for HBCUs and the Pell Grant, and then let’s do even better in FY 2023.” [<a href="https://uncf.org/?p=57639&amp;post_type=news&amp;preview=1&amp;_ppp=3055755882">Statement</a>, 3/1/22]</p>



<p><strong>Bruce Lesley, President, First Focus on Children:</strong> “I have attempted to tweet all references to children in the State of the Union for years now. This was, by far, the most references to children ever. We were pleased to hear President Biden announce initiatives to combat child poverty, lower the cost of child care,&nbsp;boost our children’s mental health, combat gun violence, continue efforts to vaccinate all kids, and to put forward other proposals that will help address longstanding issues and inequities among children.” [Statement, 3/1/22]</p>

<p>5:42 P.M. EST<br> <br>THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Good afternoon everyone.  Good afternoon.  Please have a seat.  Good afternoon.  (Applause.) <br> <br>President Joe Biden, members of Congress, and my fellow Americans: Today, we are gathered to celebrate the passage of a law that will make our nation&#8217;s workplaces more safe and more just.<br> <br>Forced arbitration silences survivors of sexual assault and harassment.  It shields predators instead of holding them accountable and gives corporations a powerful tool to hide abuse and misconduct.  And it compels the people of our nation &#8212; and most often the women of our nation &#8212; to sign away one of their most fundamental rights: the right to seek justice in court.<br> <br>The legislation the President will sign today will end forced arbitration in all cases of sexual abuse.  (Applause.)  And &#8212; and almost equally as important, it will apply retroactively &#8212; (applause) &#8212; invalidating every one of these agreements, no matter when they were entered into.<br>And as many of you know, it has been a long road to get to today.  <br> <br>I co-sponsored this legislation five years ago when I was a senator.  And we would not have reached this very moment were it not for a bipartisan group of legislators, many of whom are here today.<br> <br>These leaders &#8212; they saw clearly: This is not a partisan issue.  This is not about Republicans or Democrats.  This is about right and wrong.<br> <br>As I think about the future, our administration will work with Congress on broader forced arbitration legislation to &#8212; (applause).  And we will do that to also protect the rights of workers in cases of wage theft, racial discrimination, and unfair labor practices.  (Applause.) <br> <br>So, I will conclude today by thanking all of the people who are here &#8212; and all that your represent to make this day possible &#8212; and, in particular, all the survivors and their allies who spoke out and demanded change.  (Applause.)  Thank you for your courage and your resilience and for your leadership.  <br> <br>And now I will now welcome to the podium a woman who was instrumental in the passage of this law: Gretchen Carlson.  (Applause.) <br> <br>                        END                5:45 P.M. EST<br> </p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Cabinet Room</p>



<p>2:10 P.M. EST</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Before I begin the Cabinet meeting today, I want to give you an update on Ukraine.&nbsp; We continue to impose very severe &#8212;</p>



<p>(A chandelier above the meeting rattles.)</p>



<p>(Laughter.)&nbsp; Well, at least it&#8217;s in the middle.&nbsp; It will drop in the middle.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; I shouldn&#8217;t be &#8212;</p>



<p>&#8212; the severe economic sanctions on Putin and all those folks around him, choking off access to technology as well as cutting off access to the global financial system.&nbsp; It&#8217;s had a profound impact already.</p>



<p>And the goal was to maximize the impact on Putin and Russia, and to minimize the harm on us and our allies and friends around the world.</p>



<p>Our interest is in maintaining the strongest unified economic impact campaign that &#8212; on Putin in all of history, and I think we&#8217;re well on the way to doing that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the State of the Union Address, I announced that the Department of Justice is going after the crimes of Russian oligarchs &#8212; the Attorney General spoke to that earlier &#8212; who line their pockets with Russian people’s money and &#8212; while Ukraine and the people are hiding in subways from missiles that are being fired indiscriminately in Russian cities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, I’m announcing that we’re adding dozens of names to the list, including one of Russia’s wealthiest billionaires.&nbsp; And I’m banning travel to America by &#8212; by more than 50 Russian oligarchs, their families, and their close associates.</p>



<p>And we&#8217;re going to continue to support Ukrainian people with direct assistance.</p>



<p>I had a &#8212; a meeting this morning with the &#8212; with the quartet down in Southeast Asia, including India and Japan.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re going to continue to support the people with direct &#8212; direct assistance.</p>



<p>And on Tuesday night at the Capitol, we saw America united in support of Ukraine and in our work to hold Putin accountable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And now, to today’s meeting, we’re going to discuss how we&#8217;re going to keep the economy growing by bringing costs down for the American people as well as &#8212; we know that people are feeling the pinch, and we&#8217;re going to do everything we can to make everyday things more accessible and more affordable for the American people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And we&#8217;re also going to discuss the Unity Agenda I announced, and there was bri- &#8212; broad bipartisan agreement: trying to end the opioid epidemic; ending cancer as we know it; providing support for veterans; and mental health, especially for children.</p>



<p>Response &#8212; as you all know, because I read your polls &#8212; has been overwhelming on all four of those issues and &#8212; because they&#8217;re of great concern to the American people.</p>



<p>And today, I have progress to announce on two of them.&nbsp; Just this morning, the House passed a bill to provide healthcare to veterans suffering from toxic exposure, like burn pits.&nbsp; And 34 Republicans joined with Democrats to make bipartisan project &#8212; bipartisan progress on this project, keeping our sacred obligations that we have to veterans who we send to war and they come and we care for them.</p>



<p>And when it comes to the mental health of our children, today I’m instructing the Departments of Education, Health and Human Services to develop initial guidance to schools that will help them provide mental health support for students in our schools.&nbsp; And this is going to include enabling schools to use Medicaid funds to deliver those important services.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And because, to me, the State of the Union was more than a speech to me, it was an action plan &#8212; an action plan to lower costs, to address our critical needs.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s for the American people, because they&#8217;re confused out there, understandably.&nbsp; The world is changing so rapidly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And we have a lot to cover in this meeting today, but &#8212; I am going to invite my friends in the press to depart in a minute.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the bottom line is: I meant what I said when I said I&#8217;m optimistic.&nbsp; I&#8217;m optimistic if we are &#8212; if we use the kind of ability to unite the country, I think, that exists and I think we saw at the State of the Union, I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s anything we can&#8217;t do.&nbsp; I really don&#8217;t.</p>



<p>And we are at one of those inflection points in world history where we have an opportunity.&nbsp; If we act swiftly and we act with courage, we can change the dynamic the world is moving in.&nbsp; If we don&#8217;t, we&#8217;re going to be in real trouble.</p>



<p>And I am &#8212; but I think it presents an opportunity, as well as a problem.</p>



<p>Like I said, my mother used to always say, &#8220;Out of everything bad is something good if you look hard enough for it.&#8221;&nbsp; We&#8217;re looking hard, and I think we found some answers.</p>



<p>So, at any rate, thank you all for being here, and we&#8217;re going to get on with the meeting.</p>



<p>Thank you.</p>



<p>2:16 P.M. EST</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">James S. Brady Press Briefing Room</p>



<p>1:19 P.M. EST</p>



<p><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Hi, everyone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; It’s so nice to see everybody’s beautiful faces.&nbsp; You too, Steve Holland.&nbsp; David Sanger.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Just calling out some especially beautiful faces in the room.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Handsome devils.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Okay.</p>



<p>Just wanted to note one thing before we get started.&nbsp; As you all know, later today the President will sign the Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act into law.&nbsp; The bill amends the Federal Arbitration Act to make it easier for victims of sexual assault or harassment to go to court instead of being forced into arbitration by their employer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This law will affect the more than 60 million workers who are subject to mandatory arbitration clauses in the workplace, often without realizing it until they come forward with a claim against their employer.</p>



<p>President Biden has long spoken against forced arbitration clauses in employment contracts, and today marks an important milestone in empowering survivors of sexual assault and sexual harassment and protecting employee rights.</p>



<p>The bill would not have been possible without bipartisan work, including from those members of Congress who will be in attendance today: Representatives Bustos and Representative Griffith, and Senator Gillibrand and Senator Graham.</p>



<p>I also wanted to note, it is Ayesha Rascoe’s last day in the briefing room &#8212; (applause) &#8212; seat, before &#8212; yes, thank you for all of your work.&nbsp; And she&#8217;s going on &#8212; I mean, you&#8217;ve already announced this; I feel like I&#8217;m announcing news, but it&#8217;s been announced &#8212; to host “Weekend Edition” for NPR.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As an NPR listener, I look forward to being in my sweatpants and coffee and listening to you this weekend.</p>



<p>So, congratulations, and thank you for all of your work on behalf of the American people.</p>



<p>With that, Colleen, why don&#8217;t you kick us off?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All right.&nbsp; So, I wanted to ask about oil prices.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They’re already above 111, or so, dollars a barrel.&nbsp; Pelosi has come out also in support of banning Russian oil.&nbsp; So why keep the carveout, you know, especially when oil &#8212; with the argument that Putin is bene- &#8212; is going to not benefit from oil?&nbsp; You know what I&#8217;m trying to say.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yes, I think I do know what you&#8217;re trying to say.</p>



<p>Well, our objective and the President&#8217;s objective has been to maximize impact on President Putin and Russia, while minimizing impact to us and our allies and partners.</p>



<p>And I know you&#8217;ve heard me say this a few times before, but we don&#8217;t have a strategic interest in reducing the global supply of energy.&nbsp; And that would raise prices at the gas pump for the American people, around the world, because it would reduce the supply available.&nbsp; And it’s as simple as: Less supply raises prices.&nbsp; And that is certainly a big factor for the President in this &#8212; at this moment.</p>



<p>It could also &#8212; it also has the potential to pad the pockets of President Putin, which is exactly what we are not trying to do.</p>



<p>So, as the President has said, we carved out payments for energy, trade, and transport from our financial sectors &#8212; sanctions with that in mind.</p>



<p>I would also note that we are also take &#8212; we have been taking steps to degrade Russia&#8217;s status as a leading energy supplier over time.&nbsp; That includes, of course, shutting down Nord Stream 2 or preventing Nord Stream 2 from operating.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re surging LNG to Europe to help accelerate its diversification from Russian gas.&nbsp; And I think you&#8217;ve also seen European leaders talk about the need to reduce their reliance and to diversify.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And we are continuing to look at other options we could take right now to cut U.S. consumption of Russian energy.&nbsp; I mean, for us, if you look at publicly available data, it&#8217;s only about 10 percent of our imports.&nbsp; But again, reducing the supply out there would have an impact on prices and on prices at the gas pump.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I guess the question is: If oil is already so expensive, isn&#8217;t he already benefiting from a very &#8212; from the &#8212; from an already costly, you know, price of oil?&nbsp; How does he stand to benefit if you continue to allow that?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; If it reduces further, it makes it more expensive.&nbsp; So I think we look at it through that prism.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the cost of this, I mean, the President has sort of braced American people for this, right?&nbsp; He said that defending democracy and liberty is never without a cost.&nbsp; So is it just that banning all Russian oil and gas imports &#8212; that&#8217;s just a cost that he thinks is too much for the American people to bear?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I think there&#8217;s two different pieces here: banning royal &#8212; royal? &#8212; banning Russian imports &#8212; right? &#8212; or what he has done is carved out payments for energy, trade, and transport from our financial sanctions.&nbsp; They&#8217;re slightly two different things.</p>



<p>And the President &#8212; the volatility in the oil markets, as the President has been predicting and as you referenced he talked about in the speech he gave last week, is a direct result of the fact that President Putin invaded Ukraine, and that has created volatility.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the &#8212; the big reason, of course, that the President announced the release of the strategic &#8212; of 30 million barrels from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and the coordinated release is to address that and ensure we are doing what we can to put more in the marketplace.</p>



<p>But again, our &#8212; his prism he looks at this through is how can we maximize impact on President Putin while minimizing it on the American people.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And President Zelenskyy has called on Russia to be stripped of its ability to vote in the U.N. Security Council.&nbsp; Does the U.S. want Russia to be removed as a permanent member?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We don&#8217;t see that happening.&nbsp; We certainly understand &#8212; you know, they have a permanent seat on the Security Council.&nbsp; Of course, that is why it is so particularly disturbing that Russia, given its particular responsibility for upholding the U.N. Charter, is actively subverting the Charter and abusing its position.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The fact is, they have a permanent &#8212; we don&#8217;t &#8212; we&#8217;re really focused on isolating them, really &#8212; on isolating Russia and holding them accountable.&nbsp; And, as you know, that&#8217;s what we and our allies are focused on doing.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; President Zelenskyy is calling, again, for a no-fly zone over Ukraine.&nbsp; Is that something you&#8217;re giving any thought to at all?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Again, the reason why that has not been a step the President has been willing to take or we have been interested in taking is because a no-fly zone requires implementation.&nbsp; It would require, essentially, the U.S. military shooting down Russian planes and causing a &#8212; prompting a potential direct war with Russia, something &#8212; the exact step that we want to avoid.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the President of Finland visits tomorrow.&nbsp; Does the President want to talk to him about joining NATO?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, the President is looking forward to welcoming the President of Finland tomorrow to the White House to continue their conversations about enhancing our strong bilateral relations.</p>



<p>I would note that they have spoken twice in the last few months &#8212; once on December 13th and again on January 18th.&nbsp; I would expect they will discuss the U.S.-Finnish defense relationship, which is very strong and, in fact, complements Finland&#8217;s close partnership with NATO.&nbsp; Along with Sweden, Finland’s status is as an Enhanced Opportunity Partner for the Alliance, which helps ensure strong defense and close security ties in the Baltic Sea region.</p>



<p>But it remains &#8212; for any country &#8212; up to that country and up to members of NATO to determine any path forward there.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And lastly, Russia has been cracking down on independent media and dissent at home.&nbsp; What&#8217;s your reaction to that?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We have seen that and are deeply concerned.&nbsp; Let me give you some specific examples because, as journalists yourself, I think it will &#8212; you will hear it as quite jarring.</p>



<p>One moment.&nbsp; Sorry, I just want to find all the specifics in here.&nbsp; Thank you for your patience.&nbsp; One second.&nbsp; Okay.</p>



<p>Okay.&nbsp; The Kremlin right now is engaged in a full assault on media freedom and the truth.&nbsp; Let me give you some examples.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today independent media sites, such as Ekho Moskvy radio and TV Rain are off the air and threatened to block &#8212; or they kicked them off the air and they threatened to block online platforms such as VOA Russia.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They have &#8212; we’ve seen Russia prohibit Russian media from referring to what they are doing in Ukraine as, quote, a “war,” or, quote, an “invasion,” or, quote, an “attack.”&nbsp; They are banning their use of terms even, allowing media to use only&nbsp; government-sourced information to report on the war.</p>



<p>They’ve called a spesial [sic] &#8212; special session of the parliament to consider a bill to make “unofficial” reporting on Russia’s further invasion punishable by up to 15 years in prison.</p>



<p>They have arrested more than 7,300 protestors &#8212; some immediately after they began to protest Putin’s war of choice.</p>



<p>They have b- &#8212; they have blocked and shut down social media sites, such as Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram.</p>



<p>And they have limited the amount of dollars citizens can take out of the country.</p>



<p>What they are trying to do is block any information about what they are doing to invade a sovereign country, and they’re taking severe steps to do exactly that.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just to follow up, is the administration moving closer to banning Russian oil imports?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have any assessment of that for you.&nbsp; I just wanted to note the difference between them, or that there are several different components of options.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I guess the question is: What’s the calculus in waiting if it&#8217;s ultimately the step that the United States is going to take?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, there&#8217;s an &#8212; there&#8217;s a policy process that is undergone for any decision that is made.&nbsp; Sometimes those move rapidly.&nbsp; And often there are a range of factors that are discussed as those decisions are made.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Pentagon noted today that that Russian convoy that’s about 40 miles, at least, long is still stalled largely, they believe.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does the President still think though that ultimately Russia is successfully going to take Kyiv?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; That continues to be their aspiration.&nbsp; I think the Pentagon also noted that they now have 90 percent of their military combat power pre-staged at the Ukrainian border &#8212; is now in Ukraine.</p>



<p>They&#8217;ve launched more than 480 missiles at Ukraine in the invasion.&nbsp; That&#8217;s about &#8212; up from 450 Thur- &#8212; since Thursday.&nbsp; So, they are continuing to make &#8212; take aggressive steps and move towards their ultimate objective, which is taking over Kyiv and taking over the country.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any assessment on timing for that?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have an assessment to offer from here.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last question.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Oh, go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there any situation where President Biden would sit down with President Putin in person again, so long as Russian forces are in Ukraine?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I can&#8217;t make an assessment of that, Kaitlan.&nbsp;&nbsp; Right now, they&#8217;re invading a sovereign country and continuing to escalate every day.&nbsp; We’re never going to take diplomacy ever off the table.&nbsp; But again, now is not the moment for that.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But why not rule out an in-person meeting if he &#8212; his forces are in Ukraine, a sovereign country?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Again, we have discussions internally about what the best steps are to deescalate what is clearly a horrific conflict on the ground.&nbsp; Now is not the moment.&nbsp; We’re not planning a meeting between them or an engagement or a call.&nbsp; The President has been very, very clear about that.&nbsp; But we’ll have those discussions internally and weigh the range of factors.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; We understand that new U.S. sanctions against oligarchs are going to be announced this afternoon &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; and individual oligarchs might be named.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yes.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How is the White House choosing which oligarchs to sanction?&nbsp; Do you start with the richest ones or the ones with the closest ties to Vladimir Putin?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We look &#8212; one of the big factors is, of course, the proximity to President Putin.&nbsp; We want him to feel the squeeze.&nbsp; We want the people around him to feel the squeeze.&nbsp; I would &#8212; I don&#8217;t believe this is going to be the last set of oligarchs.&nbsp; Making them a priority and a &#8212; and a focus of our individual sanctions is something the President has been focused on.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I understand that a travel ban is going to be but one component of this announcement.&nbsp; What about oligarchs who are already here?&nbsp; Will they have to leave the country immediately?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Let me check on that for you.&nbsp; I think we&#8217;ll have some sort of backgrounder on this to get you more details. And the President will have more specifics himself in about 30 to 45 minutes &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Got it.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; &#8212; depending on how close we are in time.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; The President announced the other night a ban on Russian aircraft traveling over U.S. airspace.&nbsp; As far as you know, have there been any incursions on U.S. airspace by the Russians since then?&nbsp; And what would the U.S. do if a Russian aircraft were to violate that airspace?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I&#8217;m not aware of any incursions.&nbsp; I&#8217;m certainly happy to check on that.&nbsp; And I can check &#8212; I&#8217;d really point you to the FAA on that, but &#8212; and I&#8217;ll see if there&#8217;s more we can offer.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; And then, finally, you know, we all saw the news about the January 6th &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; committee and, you know, their belief that there was criminal activity.&nbsp; I wanted to get your reaction to that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And also, does the President believe that former Vice President Pence should volunteer to testify before the committee?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, let me first reiterate something you heard the President say: The former President subverted the Constitution in an attempt to overturn a lawful and fair election.&nbsp; His actions represent a unique and existential threat to our democracy.&nbsp; And the President has been clear that these events warrant a full investigation.&nbsp; Part of this is what we&#8217;re seeing play out.&nbsp; And what you just mentioned has been reported over the course of the morning.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We, of course, respect the independence of the Department of Justice.&nbsp; That gives confidence to the American people.&nbsp; That&#8217;s how it should always be.&nbsp; And they will make a decision &#8212; a decision about how to move from here.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As it relates to Vice President Pence, I would say: The President believes that anyone who is asked should participate in the process of getting to the bottom of what happened on January 6th.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; On gas, you just said that, you know, “less supply raises prices,” it&#8217;s not in our strategic interest to reduce the supply.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We also know, you know, the President, as recently as yesterday, talked about increasing domestic manufacturing to bring down prices on inflated items like goods.&nbsp; So why not apply the same logic to energy and increase domestic production here?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, there are 9,000 approved oil leases that the oil companies are not tapping into currently.&nbsp; So I would ask them that question.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there nothing that the administration can do to get those providers back to pre-pandemic levels?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Do you think the oil companies don&#8217;t have enough money to drill on the places that have been pre-approved?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just asking.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I would &#8212; I would point that question to them. And we can talk about it more tomorrow when you learn more.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you think that opening the Keystone Pipeline and having more energy-friendly policies might do that?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; The Keystone Pipeline has never been operational.&nbsp; It would take years for that to have any impact.&nbsp; I know a number of members of Congress have suggested that, but that is a proposed solution that has no relationship or would have no impact on what the problem is we, here, all agree is an issue.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So during that &#8212; those years where it would, you know, take to bring down prices, as you&#8217;re saying, we should just continue to buy Russian oil?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, again, Jacqui, I think you&#8217;re familiar with a number of steps we&#8217;ve taken: a historic release from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But that didn’t bring down prices &#8212; last time or this time.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, we can &#8212; well, let me finish.&nbsp; What we can do over time and what this is a rema- &#8212; reminder of, in the President&#8217;s view, is our need to reduce our reliance on oil.</p>



<p>The Europeans need to do that; we need to do that.&nbsp; If we do more to invest in clean energy, more to invest in other sources of energy, that&#8217;s exactly what we can do to prevent this from happening in the future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We welcome any Republicans from joining us in that effort.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As long as we&#8217;re buying Russian oil, though, aren&#8217;t we financing the war?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, Jacqui, again, it&#8217;s only about 10 percent of what we&#8217;re importing.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve not made any announcement about any decision on that front, but our objective here and our focus is making sure that any step we take maximizes the impact on President Putin and minimizes it on the American people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And anyone who&#8217;s calling for an end to the carveout should be clear that that would rise &#8212; raise prices.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; On the oligarchs sanctions: I know they haven&#8217;t even been announced yet &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; but I&#8217;m wondering if you could tell us like if there are criteria that you&#8217;ve laid out for them to eventually get unsanctioned.&nbsp; So the idea being that you would incentivize them to pressure Vladimir Putin to end the war by laying out certain criteria that would essentially &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; get them unsanctioned.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; That&#8217;s an interesting question.&nbsp; I mean, right now, obviously, we&#8217;re in the middle of an invasion, so I don&#8217;t think now is the moment where we are giving anybody that sort of an off-ramp, but I can certainly check if there&#8217;s more that we have conveyed to them.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What about the broader universal sanctions?&nbsp; I mean, the same answer that there&#8217;s no real criteria being laid out of, like, what steps the Kremlin needs to take for them to get unsanctioned too?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I mean, I think right in this moment, they&#8217;re marching toward Kyiv with a convoy and continuing to take reportedly barbaric steps against the people of Ukraine.&nbsp; So, no, now is not the moment where we are offering options for reducing sanctions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then one more on the domestic front.&nbsp; Senator Manchin had laid out something of a counteroffer to what the President had described during the State of the Union on his domestic agenda.&nbsp; It was involving a deficit reduction, tax reform, and drug price cuts, and some climate provisions.&nbsp; Have you heard from him about his ideas or is there communication? And what did you think &#8212; what did the White House think of that proposal from Senator Manchin?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; There have been ongoing communications with every member of the Senate &#8212; Democratic Senate and many, many, many Republicans.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not going to detail those from here.&nbsp; The President has conveyed that he sees a lot of components where there should be broad agreement on in what he has proposed, and he talked about them the other night.&nbsp; Some of them is the ability to negotiate the cost of prescription drugs.&nbsp; Everybody thinks the cost of prescription drugs should be lower.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The President certainly believes in taking steps to reduce the deficit.&nbsp; He &#8212; this government, we reduced the deficit over the course of last year.&nbsp; That&#8217;s something he already has a record of doing.&nbsp; And, obviously, taking steps to make the tax system more fair is something he believes in.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But there are a lot of components that there&#8217;s a lot of passion behind on Capitol Hill, and there needs to just be continued conversations about that.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to ask you about this suppl- &#8212; the emergency funding request &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; that was sent up to the Hill this morning.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About a third of it would go toward medical countermeasures &#8212; the antivirals the President talked about in &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; the State of the Union, the &#8212; and the antibodies.&nbsp; Do you see us getting to a point where the availability of these treatments might mean that vaccine requirements are neither necessary nor justifiable?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t think I can make a prediction of that at this point in time.&nbsp; I mean, the vaccine is still the best and most effective way &#8212; and the doctors will say this, right? &#8212; to protect people from hospitalization and death.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The pills are certainly an important development &#8212; scientific development.&nbsp; But the best step anyone can take continues to be to get vaccinated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A quick question &#8212; a follow-up to Jordan’s here about Manchin’s proposal to Build Back Better that Manchin says is dead.&nbsp; Is it &#8212; is the transformation formalized here?&nbsp; Is it no longer “Build Back Better” and now “Building a Better America”?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; That is formal.&nbsp; But no one cares about the type &#8212; the name in the American public.&nbsp; They care about what&#8217;s in it and what it&#8217;s going to do.&nbsp; And so, that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re most focused on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, thank you.&nbsp; I have a couple.&nbsp; I want to try &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; one more on the potential oil ban.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yep.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It feels like &#8212; because you now have Republicans and Democrats calling on the administration to ban oil from Russia. As you&#8217;ve laid out, there are a range of different options under consideration.&nbsp; What would the administration need to see in order to make a final decision?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Need to see how?&nbsp; Tell me more.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Happening on the ground.&nbsp; What would need to happen in order to prompt a final decision on an oil ban?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know that we look at it exactly through that prism.&nbsp; Obviously, we have not held back in taking significant historic steps that are crippling the Russian economy right now.&nbsp; I think there&#8217;s no question about that.&nbsp; And the President has led the world in doing exactly that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But what factor we&#8217;re looking at here is the impact on the gas pump for Americans and reduction of supply in the marketplace.&nbsp; A reduction of global supply would have an impact on raising prices.&nbsp; So that&#8217;s the prism we look at it through.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is &#8212; there are some interim steps that could be taken instead of a full outright ban that would potentially mitigate the costs on gas prices.&nbsp; Is there a sense that this is at a tipping point and that some of those interim options (inaudible)?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We are continuing, Kristen, to look at other options we could take right now to cut U.S. consumption of Russian energy, but in the context of maintaining a steady global supply of energy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re trying to balance.</p>



<p>Q    Okay.  Let me ask you: Is there any discussion about sharing U.S. intelligence with the Ukrainians about what is happening on the ground in real time?<br><br>     MS. PSAKI:  We have been sharing it real time.<br><br>     Q    You have been?  Okay.  And is there a sense that the communication has been enough to give them what they need in order to be in a defensive posture, in order to fend off the Russian forces to the best of their abilities to the extent that they can (inaudible)?<br><br>     MS. PSAKI:  Well, without getting too far into details of what we do, for obvious reasons, we have consistently been sharing intelligence that includes information the Ukrainians can use to inform and develop their military response to Russia’s invasion.  That has been ongoing, and reports that suggest otherwise are inaccurate.<br><br>     Q    The world is watching as this convoy is lined up outside of Kyiv.  The U.S. has been very clear you are not going to send in military forces.  Is there anything the West can do to stop the convoy in its tracks, short of military action?  Are there any possibilities that are under discussion?<br><br>     MS. PSAKI:  Well, one of the reasons the President pushed to expedite the delivery &#8212; or the approval and delivery of a security package over the weekend was to give them &#8212; the Ukrainians &#8212; more support, more equipment, more defensive weapons to utilize in this moment.  But we are not reconsidering or taking steps that would prompt a war between the United States and Russia.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And if I could, there was a little bit of breaking news as we were coming out here &#8212;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Okay.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; and you may or may not be aware of it.&nbsp; Ukraine has said it has agreed with Russia to create safe corridors, backed by ceasefires, to evacuate civilians, deliver aid.&nbsp; Is the U.S.&nbsp; aware of this?&nbsp; Will the U.S. assist in this?&nbsp; What can you tell us about this?<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We will continue to assist efforts by &#8212; efforts supported by the Ukrainians.&nbsp; I obviously haven&#8217;t talked to our national security team about this yet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I will venture to do that.&nbsp; And we can get you all any more specifics from here after the briefing if that&#8217;s helpful.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.&nbsp; President Putin spoke today with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman about the sanctions Russia is facing and specifically about global energy supply.&nbsp; Given the volatility of oil prices, does President Biden have any plans to talk to the Saudi Crown Prince?<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I &#8212; a couple of weeks ago, I would note, Brett McGurk and Amos Hochstein made a trip to Saudi Arabia to talk about a range of issues, including global market &#8212; global energy markets, as well as Yemen.&nbsp; And we will continue to have a range of ways we engage with the Saudis.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the President has no plans to talk to the Saudi Crown Prince?<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have anything to predict for you at this point in time.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And President Zelenskyy has said Russia&#8217;s actions clearly constitute a war crime.&nbsp; UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson also said that Russia&#8217;s targeting of civilians fully qualifies as a war crime.&nbsp; The President wouldn&#8217;t go that far when he was asked yesterday.&nbsp; Why has he been reluctant to label Russia’s actions a war crime?<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, there is a process and we have stood up a process internally &#8212; an internal team &#8212; to assess and look at and evaluate evidence of what we&#8217;re seeing happen on the ground.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is a standard part of our process in the U.S. government.&nbsp; I would note that we work very closely with our international partners, and we will provide any information that we surface through that process.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You know, I think we&#8217;ve seen on the ground that &#8212; that a &#8212; reports of a range of barbaric tactics, reports of targeting civilians.&nbsp; That&#8217;s all factors that we look at.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And again, that interag- &#8212; that process that has been stood up would provide any information to the ICC or any other international body taking a look at this.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go ahead.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Clears throat.)&nbsp; Excuse me.&nbsp; Are there any discussions now, or have you guys had in the &#8212; in recent weeks &#8212; recent days, I guess &#8212; it feels like weeks &#8212; with European allies about preparing staging zones for Ukrainian insurgency, perhaps to provide training and other assistance?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, there&#8217;s &#8212; right now our focus is on supporting the current Ukrainian government and leadership.&nbsp; And that includes expediting assistance, expediting military defense assistance, engaging closely with them.&nbsp; And we’ll stay focused there.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Representative Adam Smith today on MSNBC said that we &#8212; the United States &#8212; are providing some intelligence to the Ukrainians, but not providing the type of real-time and targeting that you see the U.S. military getting in war.&nbsp; So why is arming the Ukrainians with Stingers and Javelins appropriate but not providing them targeting intelligence for those weapons?<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I think this is similar to what Kristen just asked.&nbsp; I would just say that there’ve been a range of reports out there that are false.&nbsp; We can&#8217;t get into details of all of our intelligence sharing for obvious reasons.&nbsp; But we&#8217;ve continued and consistently shared a significant amount of detailed, timely intelligence on Russia&#8217;s plans and activities with the Ukrainian government to help Ukrainians defend themselves.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We&#8217;ve been doing that for months.&nbsp; This includes information that should help them inform and develop their military response to Russia&#8217;s invasion.&nbsp; That&#8217;s what&#8217;s happening &#8212; or has been happening.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go ahead, Ayesha.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; I know people have asked a lot about, you know, the price of oil, but I want to come at it in a little bit of a different way.&nbsp; The fact is that the price of oil is high, it is very unlikely to go down anytime soon, and more than likely will go up.&nbsp; What is the White House looking at?&nbsp; I know that there was the strategic release of oil, but are there other things that the White House is looking at to help consumers at the pump &#8212; maybe to, you know, direct subsidies, maybe more biofuels, maybe easing the Jones Act?<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like what is the plan for Americans who are going to have to be living with these high oil prices?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would say, first, on the release of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, it first goes to an auction, and it&#8217;s a process that will proceed.&nbsp; And a lot of that will happen over the course of the coming week.&nbsp; So we haven&#8217;t seen, obviously, all of the direct impact of the announcement that was just made two days ago.&nbsp; But a range of options remain on the table.&nbsp; I can&#8217;t get into all the details of those.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the President is quite focused on making sure that we are taking steps to reduce the impact, to ensure there is supply necessary out there.&nbsp; Obviously, tapping the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is part of that; engaging with global partners around the world who may be big global suppliers about putting more oil in the system &#8212; that is part of the discussion; ensure there are a range of domestic options.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But there have been ongoing discussions and consideration, some of that you&#8217;ve saw with the announcement of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve released just two nights ago.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And what does the White House say to American consumers?&nbsp; Like should American consumers right now be thinking, “Okay, I&#8217;m going to have to pay a lot more at the pump going forward”?&nbsp; Should they be taking that into consideration when they&#8217;re buying cars?&nbsp; Or, you know, should they try to buy more fuel-efficient cars or saving their money?&nbsp; Like what should they be doing practically at this moment, considering the price of gas is going to affect them?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Of course it is, as I&#8217;ve been saying.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s why we&#8217;ve been focused on it for weeks, if not months, to ensure we are taking every step, the President is taking every step to reduce that impact.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The release of the &#8212; his Strategic Petroleum Reserve &#8212; 30 million barrels that he announced just the other night &#8212; again, that process is just starting.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a bit of a process to get that going.&nbsp; And that will hopefully have an impact in getting more supply out there.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We &#8212; but we would say directly to consumers: The President is going to do everything we can to reduce the impact, to make sure that we are working with our partners around the world to address the volatility in the global oil markets, to consider a range of options that he can continue to take to reduce the impact that they&#8217;re feeling at the pump.&nbsp; And this has been front and center on his mind since the beginning of this conflict.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And just &#8212; there was a call with Quad leaders &#8212;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; today.&nbsp; India has a military relationship with Russia.&nbsp; Is that &#8212; was that discussed at all?&nbsp; Is there talk of &#8212; you know, talking to India about that relationship that it has with Russia?&nbsp; Is there anything that the U.S. plans to do on that?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, what I can tell you about the call &#8212; and we&#8217;ll have a more comprehensive readout soon if it&#8217;s not already out &#8212; is that the President felt it was a constructive conversation.&nbsp; He asked members &#8212; he suggested &#8212; or they all discussed, I should say &#8212; having members of their national security team follow up from there.&nbsp; But I&#8217;m not going to get into more details about the conversation beyond that.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; Pivoting to the Supreme Court.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you respond to some of the criticisms that Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell laid out about Ketanji Brown Jackson?&nbsp; I think he said that she won&#8217;t shun court packing and that she&#8217;s only had two opinions on the D.C. circuit level.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; So, as I think you&#8217;re referencing, Ketanji Brown Jackson &#8212; Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson has obviously started to have meetings on Capitol Hill that have been ongoing.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would note that, as it relates to the first question, the Constitution is clear that the number of questio- &#8212; of Justices is a question for Congress, not the Judiciary.&nbsp; And a number of you have actually pointed out this morning that during Justice Amy Coney Barrett’s confirmation hearing, she was asked a question about court packing or court enlargement.&nbsp; And she said, quote, “That is a question left open to Congress.”<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#8217;d also note that, yesterday, Senator McConnell also said that there was, quote, “no question” that Judge Jackson was qualified for the Supreme Court.&nbsp; And earlier in the day, he said they&#8217;d had a good meeting.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think there&#8217;s no question that, as a judge who has been confirmed three times by &#8212; by the Senate, someone who has a long record as both a jurist who has ruled in the direction of Democrats and Republicans, that she is someone who&#8217;s eminently qualified for this job, which is why the President nominated her.<br><br><br></p>



<p>Yeah.</p>



<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One more on the State of the Union.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The President repudiated the phrase “defund the police.”&nbsp; And I wonder if you can talk a little bit about the genesis of that line in the speech.&nbsp; Was it about rising crime in American cities or Republican attacks?<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And there&#8217;s also been criticism, you know, that he did not talk about police accountability more in the State of the Union.&nbsp; I wonder if you can respond to that as well.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; Well, on the first part of the question, that&#8217;s been the President&#8217;s view for decades.&nbsp; He&#8217;s never been a supporter of defunding the police.&nbsp; He made that clear on the campaign.&nbsp; There has been attempts to mischaracterize his position and the position of, frankly, a number of his Democratic colleagues.</p>



<p>And, yes, it is true that in the State of the Union the President felt it was important to speak to safe communities, the steps that he would continue to support to ensure there was funding for local police departments.&nbsp; But that has been his position for decades.&nbsp; It was simply a restatement of that.</p>



<p>On the second part of your question, I would say that the President has been clear many times that he believes that we need to continue to ensure police departments have the funding they need, that there are strong relationships and partnerships built with communities, but that there also needs to be steps that are taken to ensure there are accountability measures put in place.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He was a strong supporter of the bipartisan discussion about police reform that unfortunately stalled but remains &#8212; you know, a consideration of an executive order remains under consideration.</p>



<p>I would also note that there are a number of steps that the Department of Justice has taken &#8212; banning chokeholds, et cetera &#8212; at the federal level that the President is proud that he &#8212; that has happened in his administration.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, I wanted to return to this question of finding off-ramps for Putin that we discussed.&nbsp; So, from your many years in the State Department in a situation like this, that&#8217;s the first thing that diplomats begin to try to think about.&nbsp; You need something face saving if you were going to get him to reduce the amount of violence and going into Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What kind of ideas are you kicking around here that might provide a way for him to find a more graceful way out of this before you&#8217;ve got the kind of large-scale civilian casualties you&#8217;re clearly worried about?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah, I think one, David, we have had &#8212; provided many off-ramps to President Putin through the course of the last several months.&nbsp; I know there have been a range of discussions about transparency measures, about positions of missile defense systems that have been undertaken for the last several weeks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s going to be very hard to have a &#8212; for diplomacy to succeed without military de-escalation.&nbsp; And whatever we do, we&#8217;re going to do that in lockstep with our partners and allies.</p>



<p>Secretary Blinken is leaving today for Brussels.&nbsp; He&#8217;s going to meet with NATO, the EU, and the G7 allies and partners to continue our close coordination before heading to Poland, Moldova, and the Baltic countries.</p>



<p>But, again, our effort and our focus right now is continue to work with our allies and partners to implement these sanctions, put the pressure on, and leave the door open to diplomacy, of course.&nbsp; But it&#8217;s difficult to do that in the middle of a war.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So if there is de-escalation, if you could get a ceasefire, for example, in &#8212; before Kyiv turned into more of a ruin, is the administration willing to then suspend some of the sanctions that they&#8217;ve recently announced?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I&#8217;m not going to lay out conditions from here.&nbsp; I think those are conversations &#8212; there’s a range of conversations, if there are de-escalatory steps, that we would have with our European partners.&nbsp; And obviously Secretary Blinken will be playing a front-and-center role in doing exactly that.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One last one for you.&nbsp; President Zelenskyy, in a news conference he gave a few hours ago, said that the West should recognize that where Putin is headed toward, he said, was Berlin.&nbsp; His point being that he wanted to take this war beyond Ukraine. Is that the administration&#8217;s current assessment based on what Putin has said in public, in his conversations with Macron, with the President, and so forth?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I think we all watched the speech &#8212; which now feels like it was a year ago, but was only last week &#8212; where he made clear he had broad ambitions of what he wanted to achieve.</p>



<p>It is also true, though, that NATO has never been more unified, thanks in part to President Putin&#8217;s aggression.&nbsp; And there are a range of countries that are exactly in that region who are NATO partners and Allies.&nbsp; And President Putin would have to make a decision to go into a country where there is a NATO Alliance, where there&#8217;s Article 5 obligations, you know, should he decide he wants to proceed beyond.</p>



<p>So, I don&#8217;t have a new assessment from here, other than &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But he could go to Moldova or Georgia.&nbsp; They&#8217;re not NATO members.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Certainly, I understand that.&nbsp; But, you know, again, David, I don&#8217;t have a new assessment to offer.&nbsp; But we are also closely watching, of course, what President Putin does and is doing since he delivered that speech last week.&nbsp; But I don&#8217;t have anything new beyond what he has himself said publicly.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pivoting back to the President’s State of the Union speech.&nbsp; On Tuesday, he said that he wants to secure our border and fix the immigration system.&nbsp; That&#8217;s a bit of a shift from last year&#8217;s speech to Congress, where he spoke more about trying to find the root causes of why people are migrating.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Why was there this sort of shift in messaging, kind of focusing on securing the border?&nbsp; And is that a new priority or is &#8212; has &#8212; have priorities changed on immigration for the administration?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; No, I would say, first, the bill that the President proposed on his first day in office included smarter security and border protections.&nbsp; And also, it included a more humane path for migrants entering the country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Both of those remain priorities for the President.&nbsp; He believes that the sys- &#8212; the immigration system is broken, it&#8217;s long overdue to fix it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He also believes &#8212; and worked on this very closely as Vice President &#8212; that addressing the root causes is one of the central steps we need to remain focused on, even as we&#8217;re trying to address the current circumstances at the border.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then why was it important for the President to say to sec- &#8212; you know, advocate for securing our border?&nbsp; I know he&#8217;s been criticized heavily, you know, by Republicans, by certain folks on how he&#8217;s handled immigration at the border.&nbsp; So, was that important for him to say in his speech?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;Well, that&#8217;s part of his bill that he proposed, so it&#8217;s consistent with his policies.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And one last question: Has there been any discussion on ending Title 42?&nbsp; I know we&#8217;ve talked &#8212; the President even talked about it on Tuesday &#8212; about how we&#8217;re moving past the pandemic.&nbsp; This is obviously a policy that’s been kept in place because of the pandemic.&nbsp; Has there been any discussions on ending that?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, that is a decision for the CDC to make.&nbsp; I believe Dr. Walensky said yesterday that she&#8217;s reviewing that decision.&nbsp; So, I can&#8217;t get ahead of any decision she makes, but she is looking at that, and that&#8217;s an assessment they make from the CDC.</p>



<p>Go ahead, Karen.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; Back to oligarchs and the sanctions: You had said earlier that you want Putin to &#8220;feel the squeeze&#8221; and the people around him to &#8220;feel the squeeze.&#8221;&nbsp; How does the administration feel that these sanctions could actually change his behavior and result in de-escalation?&nbsp; You know, what evidence is there that the sanctions like this would work for what you want to achieve right now?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, it&#8217;s a factor.&nbsp; It’s not the only factor.&nbsp; Right?&nbsp; But what we&#8217;re talking about here is seizing their assets, seizing their yachts, and making it harder for them to send, you know, their children to colleges and universities in the West.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These are significant steps that will impact the people who are closely around President Putin.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not the only step we&#8217;re taking.&nbsp; Obviously, the financial sanctions and the steps we&#8217;ve taken have crippled the financial sector so much in Russia that they&#8217;ve kept the stock market closed for a couple of days.</p>



<p>So, it&#8217;s just an effort to get close to the people around President Putin.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And Canada announced a new program to expedite refugee arrivals and says there&#8217;s no limit on how many can apply.&nbsp; Is there a conversation in the administration about raising the refugee cap to accommodate Ukrainians that would want to come here?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; You know, I have to check and see if the cap would actually need to be raised.&nbsp; We have said that we continue to be open to receiving refugees, of course; that what our focus is on, given the vast majority of them have expressed an interest in going to European countries and neighboring countries, is being the largest provider of humanitarian assistance in the world, something that we increased over the course of the last several days &#8212; and Samantha Power made an announcement about that &#8212; and continuing to provide assistance that way.&nbsp; But we remain open as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think it&#8217;s just, again, important to note what the preference is of the vast majority of the refugees who are leaving Ukraine.</p>



<p>Go ahead.&nbsp; Oh, we got to wrap up in a second, but go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; President Zelenskyy, earlier, said &#8212; you know, calling for a no-fly zone again &#8212; said, “If you don&#8217;t have the strength to close the sky, then give me planes.”&nbsp; Is the United States open to sending more air support to Ukraine?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Again, I&#8217;m not going to get into more details of what the Department of Defense may or may not consider.&nbsp; But what I will tell you is that we&#8217;ve continued to provide a range of defensive assistance, something we have increased only &#8212; only increased &#8212; over the last several days.&nbsp; But we are not considering taking steps that would put us in direct conflict with Russia.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there any concern with &#8212; you know, you&#8217;ve laid out the explanation for why steering clear of sanctioning Russia&#8217;s energy sector at this point.&nbsp; Is part of the calculation &#8212; in terms of how much to ratchet up &#8212; you know, worrying that Putin will at some point determine that the U.S. has already joined the conflict everywhere but the battlefield and will retaliate?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Is that part of &#8212; is that a factor in the administration&#8217;s decision-making, in terms of how far to go?&nbsp; Or is that already factored in?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I&#8217;m not sure I understand the question.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, the sense that Putin may retaliate against the United States, whether through cyberattack, some &#8212; you know, some other measure.&nbsp; Is trying to avoid that and trying to maybe not go past a certain line, potentially &#8212; is that something the administration is &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I would say that the sanctions &#8212; the financial sanctions that we have issued are on par with what we have done to Iran.&nbsp; They are significant, they are historic, and they are crippling the sector.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, I don&#8217;t think we have held back in any capacity, aside from making sure we&#8217;re prioritizing the impact on the American people.&nbsp; So, no, I would not say that&#8217;s how we view it.</p>



<p>Okay, everyone.&nbsp; I&#8217;m sorry.&nbsp; I&#8217;m sorry, guys.&nbsp; We&#8217;ll do this again tomorrow, and we&#8217;ll be here.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thanks, everyone.&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; I forgot I don’t have a mask.&nbsp; I looked for it.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Thanks, everyone.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Today, Jennifer Klein, White House Gender Policy Council Director, Julie Chavez Rodriguez, White House Intergovernmental Affairs Director, and Danielle Conley, Deputy White House Counsel, hosted a roundtable discussion with Florida reproductive rights advocates and elected leaders to discuss Florida’s House Bill 5, which severely restricts access to abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy. The bill is expected to pass soon and become law. &nbsp;</p>



<p>During the meeting, Florida leaders shared their efforts opposing HB 5 and the steps they are taking to support women’s access to reproductive health care. Senior Administration Officials emphasized the Administration’s support of Floridians’ reproductive rights and thanked the leaders for their efforts. They also discussed the larger trend of state laws restricting access to critical reproductive health care in states across the country. To date, over 265 bills restricting access to abortion have been filed during the 2022 legislative session. This week marked six months since Texas law SB 8 went into effect, a law that violates Texans’ constitutional rights under <em>Roe v. Wade</em>. In the face of these challenges, Administration Officials reiterated the Administration’s commitment to exploring every option to protect reproductive health care.</p>



<p>In his State of the Union address on Tuesday, President Biden declared that the constitutional right affirmed by <em>Roe v. Wade</em> is under attack as never before and reiterated his commitment to protecting women’s access to health care.</p>



<p>Florida reproductive rights advocates and state legislators and their staff who participated in today’s meeting included:</p>



<ul><li>Senate Democratic Leader Lauren Book</li><li>Incoming House Democratic Leader Fentrice Driskell</li><li>Sen. Lori Berman</li><li>Sen. Gary Farmer</li><li>Sen. Jason Pizzo</li><li>Rep. Anna Eskamani</li><li>Rep. Dotie Joseph</li><li>Rep Michele Raynor</li><li>Rep. Kelly Skidmore</li><li>Rep.

<p>Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, within 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President publishes in the <em>Federal Register</em> and transmits to the Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the anniversary date.&nbsp; In accordance with this provision, I have sent to the <em>Federal Register</em> for publication the enclosed notice stating that the national emergency with respect to Iran that was declared on March 15, 1995, is to continue in effect beyond March 15, 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The actions and policies of the Government of Iran continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the&nbsp;national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United&nbsp;States.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For these reasons, I have determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency declared in Executive Order&nbsp;12957 with respect to Iran and to maintain in force comprehensive sanctions against Iran to respond to this threat.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-right">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>On March 15, 1995, by Executive Order 12957, the President declared a national emergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706), to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States constituted by the actions and policies of the Government of Iran.&nbsp; On May 6, 1995, the President issued Executive Order 12959, imposing more comprehensive sanctions on Iran to further respond to this threat.&nbsp; On August 19, 1997, the President issued Executive Order 13059, consolidating and clarifying those previous orders.&nbsp; The President took additional steps pursuant to this national emergency in Executive Order 13553 of September 28, 2010; Executive Order 13574 of May 23, 2011; Executive Order 13590 of November 20, 2011; Executive Order 13599 of February 5, 2012; Executive Order 13606 of April 22, 2012; Executive Order 13608 of May 1, 2012; Executive Order 13622 of July 30, 2012; Executive Order 13628 of October 9, 2012; Executive Order 13645 of June 3, 2013; Executive Order 13716 of January 16, 2016, which revoked Executive Orders 13574, 13590, 13622, 13645, and provisions of Executive Order 13628; Executive Order 13846 of August 6, 2018, which revoked Executive Orders 13716 and 13628; Executive Order 13871 of May 8, 2019; Executive Order 13876 of June 24, 2019; Executive Order 13902 of January 10, 2020; and Executive Order 13949 of September 21, 2020.</p>



<p>The actions and policies of the Government of Iran &#8212; including its proliferation and development of missiles and other asymmetric and conventional weapons capabilities, its network and campaign of regional aggression, its support for terrorist groups, and the malign activities of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and its surrogates &#8212; continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For these reasons, the national emergency declared on March&nbsp;15, 1995, must continue in effect beyond March 15, 2022.&nbsp; Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1&nbsp;year the national emergency with respect to Iran declared in Executive Order 12957.&nbsp; The emergency declared by Executive Order 12957 constitutes an emergency separate from that declared on November 14, 1979, by Executive Order 12170, in connection with the hostage crisis.&nbsp; This renewal, therefore, is distinct from the emergency renewal of November 9, 2021.</p>



<p>This notice shall be published in the <em>Federal Register </em>and transmitted to the Congress.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-right">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.</p>

<p>On March 8, 2015, the President issued Executive Order&nbsp;13692, declaring a national emergency with respect to the situation in Venezuela, including the Government of Venezuela&#8217;s erosion of human rights guarantees, persecution of political opponents, curtailment of press freedoms, use of violence and human rights violations and abuses in response to antigovernment protests, and arbitrary arrest and detention of antigovernment protesters, as well as the exacerbating presence of significant government corruption.</p>



<p>The President took additional steps pursuant to this national emergency in Executive Order 13808 of August 24, 2017; Executive Order 13827 of March 19, 2018; Executive Order 13835 of May 21, 2018; Executive Order 13850 of November 1, 2018; Executive Order 13857 of January 25, 2019; and Executive Order&nbsp;13884 of August 5, 2019.</p>



<p>The circumstances, as described in Executive Order&nbsp;13692 and in subsequent Executive Orders issued with respect to Venezuela, have not improved, and they continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.&nbsp; Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13692.</p>



<p>This notice shall be published in the <em>Federal&nbsp;Register </em>and transmitted to the Congress.</p>
