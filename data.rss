<p class="has-text-align-center">Via Teleconference</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">(June 14, 2021)</p>



<p>7:06 P.M. EDT<br>&nbsp;<br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Hello, everybody.&nbsp; This is [senior administration official].&nbsp; Thank you very much for making time to talk tonight as we approach the release of the first National Strategy for Countering Domestic Terrorism tomorrow morning.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>As you&#8217;ll recall, President Biden indicated that we would be releasing this strategy in his remarks in Tulsa recently.&nbsp; And so what I&#8217;m going to give you tonight is a sense of how we have done this work and what the main lines of effort are in the national strategy that will be released tomorrow.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Since January 20th, the President has focused on addressing the elevated threat of domestic terrorism.&nbsp; And he has been equally focused on ensuring that our efforts to counter it take place within the context of upholding American civil rights and civil liberties.&nbsp; Those are the very freedoms that make us unique.<br>&nbsp;<br>He has discussed this issue many times with key Cabinet members, including with Attorney General Garland, Homeland Security Secretary Mayorkas, Secretary of Defense Austin, Secretary of State Blinken, and others.&nbsp; And he has emphasized the necessity to conduct this work in a way that never undermines those freedoms, those values, and those legal guardrails.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>In order to get objective and fast at &#8212; in order to get an objective and fact-based review of the threats that we face, President Biden tasked the intelligence and law enforcement communities during his first week in office to produce a comprehensive assessment of today&#8217;s domestic violent extremist threat.&nbsp; The goal underpinning that assessment was to establish a factual basis about the risk that domestic terrorists pose upon which we could then formulate a strategy and an implementation plan for countering domestic terrorism.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>An unclassified summary of that baseline study was released in March, and it found that domestic violent extremists, motivated by a range of ideologies, pose an elevated threat to our country in 2021, with racially or ethnically motivated violent extremists &#8212; and specifically those who espouse the superiority of the white race &#8212; and anti-government militia violent extremists posing the most lethal threat.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Further, it found that violent extremists to promote the superiority of the white race have the most persistent transnational connections and may be in frequent contact with violent extremists abroad.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>However, it&#8217;s important to underscore that the study provided to us by ODNI did not find a robust nexus between domestic terrorism and foreign actors.&nbsp; This is largely today an inside-out problem, not an outside-in problem, although we do know that our adversaries are seeking to sow divisions in our society.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The strategy, which builds upon this fact-based assessment, seeks to organize U.S. government efforts to counter domestic terrorism into four pillars.&nbsp; This overarching goal is the prevention, disruption, and deterrence of domestic terrorism.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>What I&#8217;ll do now is outline for you the main lines of effort in these four pillars.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The first pillar seeks to understand and analyze and share domestic-terrorism-related information.&nbsp; It builds directly off of the ODNI threat assessment that I described.&nbsp; Our goal is to enhance domestic terrorism analysis and improve information sharing throughout law enforcement at the federal, state, local, Tribal, and territorial level, and where appropriate with private sector partners.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation has implemented a new system to methodically track domestic terrorism cases nationwide.&nbsp; The Department of State, as well as the intelligence and law enforcement communities, will continue to learn more from foreign partners about the international dimensions of this threat.<br>&nbsp;<br>Pillar two involves the prevention of domestic terrorism recruitment and mobilization to violence.&nbsp; Drawing on the expertise of a variety of federal departments and agencies, we will work with communities to help them become more resilient to prevent individuals from ever reaching the point of committing terrorist violence.&nbsp; To do this, we&#8217;ll be strengthening domestic terrorism prevention resources and services.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>For the first time, the Department of Homeland Security has designated domestic violent extremism as a national priority area within the Department of Homeland Security grant program. &nbsp;And that means that more than $77 million will be allocated to state and local and other partners to prevent, protect against, and respond to domestic violent extremism.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>In addition, the Department of Defense is incorporating training for servicemembers separating or retiring from the military, who may potentially be targeted by those who seek to radicalize them.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>We will work to improve public awareness of federal resources to address concerning or threatening behavior before violence occurs.&nbsp; And on that, I would just note that one of the things we&#8217;re talking about is the need to do something in this space, like the “See something” &#8212; “If you see something, say something” concept that has been promulgated previously by DHS.&nbsp; This involves creating contexts in which those who are family members or friends or co-workers know that there are pathways and avenues to raise concerns and seek help for those who they have perceived to be radicalizing and potentially radicalizing towards violence.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>We will also be (inaudible) efforts to address online terrorist recruitment and mobilization to violence through increased information sharing with the technology sector and through the creation of innovative approaches to fostering digital literacy and building resilience to terrorist recruitment and mobilization.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>One of the principal tools now at our disposal is our decision to join the Christchurch Call to Action to Eliminate Terrorist and Violent Extremist Content Online.&nbsp; This is an international partnership between governments and technology companies that works to develop new solutions to eliminating terrorist content online while safeguarding the freedom of online expression.&nbsp; The previous administration had decided against participation in this important endeavor, and we determined that it was in our interest to join it and to work collaboratively with countries that share our values and the private sector in countering these pernicious developments in which online platforms are used to promote radicalization and violence.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Pillar three involves the disruption and deterrence of domestic terrorist activity.&nbsp; The work of federal law enforcement, as well as our state, local, Tribal, and territorial law enforcement partners, is critical to countering domestic terrorism.&nbsp; The U.S. government will increase support to these law enforcement partners in addressing domestic terrorism nationwide.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>U.S. attorney&#8217;s offices and FBI field offices across the country have formally made domestic terrorism a top priority and are tracking comprehensively domestic-terrorism-related cases, reallocating or requesting appropriate funding and resources as needed to target the threat.&nbsp; That includes over $100 million in additional resources for the Department of Justice, the FBI, and the Department of Homeland Security that are included in the President&#8217;s fiscal year 2022 budget to ensure that we have the analysts, investigators, prosecutors, and other personnel, and resources that we need to thwart domestic terrorism and bring domestic terrorists to justice when the law has been broken.&nbsp; State, local, Tribal, and territorial law enforcement will have access to increased intelligence sharing and training on domestic terrorism and associated threats as well.<br>&nbsp;<br>Within the federal government, we have a special responsibility to ensure that we address the possibility of insider threats, especially among those who have the opportunity to be working in law enforcement or in the military.&nbsp; The Office of Personnel Management will consider updates to the forms used to apply for sensitive roles in the federal government that could assist investigators in identifying potential domestic terrorism threats.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The Department of Defense, Department of Justice, and Homeland Security Department are similarly pursuing efforts to ensure that domestic terrorists are not employed within our military or law enforcement ranks, and that they improve their screening and vetting processes.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Training and resources will be developed for state, local, Tribal, and territorial law enforcement partners, as well as for sensitive private sector partners, to enable them to enhance their own employee screening program and to prevent individuals, who pose domestic terrorism threats, from being placed in positions of trust.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The fourth pillar of this strategy involves confronting long-term contributors to domestic terrorism.&nbsp; It&#8217;s important to recognize that there are broader efforts that must be pursued in tandem to the work that we will do specifically to counter the domestic terrorism challenge.&nbsp; This work has to happen in parallel to the strategy to address some of the long-term drivers and enablers of domestic terrorism, including economic inequality, those who feel left behind by the 21st century economy, structural racism, and the proliferation of guns.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>That is work that will be data across our administration over the years of our time in service and will be an essential contributor to the outcomes that we seek on this front.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So with that, I&#8217;m going to hand the mic over to [senior administration official] and ask if he has any additional remarks that he wants to make before we open this up to questions.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; No, thank you.&nbsp; I appreciate people joining and I&#8217;ll hand it back to [senior administration official] to facilitate questions.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; We can turn it back over to the moderator now for Q&amp;A.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, there.&nbsp; Thanks so much for having the call.&nbsp; Hopefully you can hear me.&nbsp; I wanted to &#8212; so, a couple of questions.&nbsp; One, you mentioned the request the Biden administration has made through the budgetary process.&nbsp; I mean, is this strategy basically acknowledging that the federal government does need to hire, recruit, you know, additional investigators, analysts, and prosecutors in order to really combat this issue?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Secondly, I know there was some talk earlier about potentially examining the authorities around the no-fly list and adding some extremist groups to those lists.&nbsp; Can you provide us an update on that as well?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And then I&#8217;m hoping you can just provide a bit more specifics in terms of the relationship with tech companies.&nbsp; We often hear that a lot &#8212; that the government is trying to work with social media companies. &nbsp;What is being done specifically?<br>&nbsp;<br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Great, thank you for the questions.&nbsp; And I&#8217;ll take them in order.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>To start out, I think what the budget request, as well as the strategy document, reflects is a sense that this threat is &#8212; as the professionals and experts in our government conveyed in that March assessment and at other opportunities &#8212; is elevated.&nbsp; That’s their word, not mine.&nbsp; And that tackling it means ensuring that we do have the resources and personnel to address that elevated threat.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>That, of course, can&#8217;t wait for the process of ensuring that we get additional resources, recruiting and training individuals; that is already happening.&nbsp; And, of course, you see manifestations of that, including in the pretty extraordinary pace and scope of work done by investigators and prosecutors in the wake of the January 6 events.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>But the sense that this threat is going to remain persistent, that we will continue to step up and augment our efforts to address it, I think is captured, in part, by that budget request, by the strategy, and by the desire to ensure that FBI &#8212; as well as broader DOJ and DHS, among others &#8212; have the personnel and resources they need to tackle this threat specifically, even while addressing international terrorism and all the other threats they&#8217;re charged with protecting Americans from.<br>&nbsp;<br>On your second question: The strategy will have a brief mention of the sort of watch-listing issue that you flagged.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll say that the strategy and our work under it leaves in place preexisting law and preexisting policy in this area while clarifying what its implementation means in light of the current threat environment.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Now, what I mean by that is this: When individuals who meet the existing standards &#8212; meaning, known or suspected terrorists with international connectivity &#8212; when they meet those standards, they will be considered for appropriate watch-listing, regardless of their ideology.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>That&#8217;s the goal here, is being ideologically neutral.&nbsp; And those who pose a threat to public safety and air travel, or other forms of public safety, meet the relevant thresholds, whatever their particular political motivation, ideological motivation might be &#8212; we want to ensure we&#8217;re offering the necessary protection from the threat they might pose.<br>&nbsp;<br>That ideological neutrality is being carried across the watch-listing enterprise while also leaving in place the sort of mechanisms for anyone who believes an error has been committed &#8212; the redress procedures available to individuals in appropriate circumstances to seek a correction if they believe one is appropriate.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Finally, you asked about tech companies, and it&#8217;s an important part of the strategy because a great deal of the relevant recruitment, radicalization, mobilization to violence does happen online.&nbsp; Again, that&#8217;s not me saying that; that&#8217;s the experts and professionals who assessed that in that March 2021 report assessment and continue to assess that.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So, there are a number of ways in which we&#8217;re trying to augment our efforts to get at that challenge.&nbsp; One is by enhancing, augmenting the information-sharing the government does with tech companies so as to facilitate their more assertive voluntary enforcement of their terms of service on their platforms to protect other users from those who might pose threats of violence.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>We, as a government, see different things from what any particular tech company might see.&nbsp; Any particular tech company often knows its own platform very well.&nbsp; But the government sees things &#8212; actually, threats of violence &#8212; across platforms.&nbsp; They see the relationship between online recruitment, radicalization, and violence in the physical world.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And so, helping to illuminate these threats is a process that has already begun between the government and the tech sector.&nbsp; And it will continue, again, specifically on this issue set, given the priority we’re placing in addressing it.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The second piece of this is, as [senior administration official] mentioned, our recent endorsement of the Christchurch Call.&nbsp; That forum allows us to leverage other governments that share our concerns in this area, as well as our commitment to free expression online in addressing some of these challenges with tech companies, and doing so with civil society stakeholders fully integrated into the conversation.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And then the third piece I&#8217;ll flag in this area &#8212; and this gets mentioned in the strategy as well &#8212; is fostering programming that can build digital literacy and other forms of resilience to domestic terrorist recruitment online and, frankly, other forms of malicious content online that bad actors deliberately try to disseminate.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>You&#8217;ve seen this in DHS’s recent call for grant proposals where they specifically invited digital literacy programming.&nbsp; And you&#8217;ll see other efforts in this area to try to help build that digital fitness across the (inaudible).&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you very much for doing this.&nbsp; The strategy mentions that the Defense Department is reviewing it and updating its definition of “prohibited extremist activities.”&nbsp; So we&#8217;re clear: Does that mean the Defense Department is looking into whether participating in an extremist group is grounds for separation?&nbsp; Because right now, simply being a member of, say, a white supremacist group is not enough to get a service member involuntarily separated.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Yeah, thanks for the good question.&nbsp; And, obviously, the Defense Department has really shown a lot of leadership on this, starting early in this administration, to ensure that those critical and sensitive positions &#8212; positions of trust that service members and others within the Defense Department hold &#8212; can&#8217;t be abused or exploited for the sort of nefarious purposes that domestic terrorists would like to see them exploited for.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So, as the strategy indicates, they are relooking at a number of things, and one of those is the one you rightly flag, which is how they understand &#8212; quite literally how they define “extremism” for these purposes.&nbsp; They are working that quite hard, both as a policy matter with the security experts and with lawyers at the Defense Department and elsewhere, to ensure they&#8217;re doing this in a way they feel ratchets up the protections but also respects expression and association protections, again, for service members and for others.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And so, I know that they will have more to say as they complete their review.&nbsp; But in a sense, the work &#8212; the critical work that they&#8217;re doing through their Countering Extremism Working Group is something of an implementing arm within the Defense Department for the overall U.S. government&#8217;s strategic approach that you&#8217;ll see laid out (inaudible).<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey, guys.&nbsp; Thanks for the opportunity.&nbsp; I wonder if you could talk a little bit about why this strategy doesn&#8217;t take a position on what may be the biggest public policy question in the domestic terrorism arena, which is whether there should be a new statute criminalizing domestic terrorism.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And then, also, could you talk about what is going to be the inevitable criticism on the right &#8212; that this strategy calls for using the tools of counterterrorism against, essentially, far-right extremists?&nbsp; Even though you&#8217;re saying it&#8217;s going to be ideologically neutral, we&#8217;re already hearing a lot of rhetoric from Republicans and Trump supporters who fear that that&#8217;s not the case.<br>&nbsp;<br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; On the first question, the President wanted his Justice Department and his new Attorney General to take a hard look at the question of whether new authorities are necessary based on facts and analysis.&nbsp; And so the strategy request that the Justice Department review this question and come back to him with a recommendation &#8212; based upon that, we can move forward.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>But we concluded that we didn&#8217;t have the evidentiary basis yet to decide whether we wanted to proceed in that direction or whether we have sufficient authority, as they currently exist at the federal level in conjunction with possible in all 50 states, to continue as we are currently organized in the pursuit of prosecution in this arena.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And, [senior administration official], I’ll let you answer another.<br>&nbsp;<br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Yeah, sure.&nbsp; Thanks for the good questions.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So, on the second: You know, we have been rigorous here in grounding this work and the work of the experts and the professionals.&nbsp; Their threat assessment that guided us in our strategy and policy development is &#8212; that&#8217;s part of why we ensured that Congress had that threat assessment in full when it was delivered in March, and that the public &#8212; including you all, of course &#8212; had the opportunity at least to see the unclassified executive summary, which establishes that this is a real threat, an elevated threat, in the words of those professionals, and that therefore formulating a strategy to tackle it makes sense.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And we have been rigorous not just in the crafting of the strategy, but also in its implementation, which is well underway, in remaining laser-focused on violence and the threat of violence.<br>&nbsp;<br>This is a strategy that is agnostic as to political ideology or off the spectrum.&nbsp; What matters is when individuals take their political or other grievances and turn that &#8212; unacceptably, unlawfully &#8212; into violent action.&nbsp; That&#8217;s where it comes within the sway of &#8212; so, in the document, that&#8217;s where it&nbsp;becomes something that is &#8212; deemed domestic terrorism, it requires the sort of response that cannot only protect public safety, but in a sense, protect threats to our democratic integrity.<br>&nbsp;<br>You&#8217;ll notice,&nbsp;in the document, that when we list some of the recent incidents that speak to the elevated threat level, that they come across the political spectrum.&nbsp; We acknowledge the shooting at the Congressional baseball game, the attack on police officers in Dallas, just as we acknowledge the attack in Charlottesville and the attack on the Capitol on January 6th.<br>&nbsp;<br>So, it&#8217;s not motivating politics or ideology that matters for us or, more importantly, for the strategy and implementation; it&#8217;s when political grievances become acts of violence.&nbsp; And we remain laser-focused on that, and that&#8217;s how we&#8217;ll continue.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey, guys, thanks very much.&nbsp; Two questions &#8212; one on the Pentagon.&nbsp; You talked about how the Pentagon is going to be training for those departing the military.&nbsp; The services have resisted some of that training and some of that acknowledgement that there&#8217;s a threat.&nbsp; Can you talk about whether you think this strategy overcomes that resistance, or you think that resistance is lowering?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And then to zoom out a little bit and talk about a question that the Europeans are asking about the current trip: A lot of experts in this space say that, you know, there have been people focused on this issue for years, and they just haven&#8217;t had the political top cover in the last few years.&nbsp; You&#8217;re obviously trying to provide that political top cover now.&nbsp; What guarantee can you try and make that that political top cover will outlast these four years?&nbsp; Thanks.<br>&nbsp;<br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; On the first question: Look, Secretary Austin has made this a priority, and as you know, the Pentagon is one of the most disciplined and hierarchical organizations in the world.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And so, the efforts to pursue this in a rigorous way, to develop a plan that will enable the Department of Defense to ensure that if people are both, as they are recruited into the military and as they leave the military, and within those two bounds, when they&#8217;re in the military &#8212; that they are people who are worthy of the role of a military member if &#8212; and to, when they leave, are not preyed upon &#8212; is something that we trust that all those who are leading the services will support, if that&#8217;s the direction that the Secretary of Defense asked them to move.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And on the second: Look, we have based this strategy on hard evidence.&nbsp; And what we will continue to do, as I indicated at the outset, is provide the facts, as they&#8217;re developed, to our country, to American citizens, to understand what we&#8217;re up against here and to do our work to counter, as [senior administration official] just said, those who seek to use violence to achieve their political ends.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And that is going to be a project for us for the foreseeable future and in which we are investing many agencies of the government and resourcing them appropriately and asking our citizens to participate.&nbsp; Because, ultimately, this is really about homeland security being a responsibility of each citizen of our country to help us achieve.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And so, we will do our very best in the years that we have in service and seek to embed this pattern of action and behavior in a way that will create conditions of public safety and, at the same time, ensure that people can express their political views as is appropriate in a democracy.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, thanks.&nbsp; On page 18 of the strategy document, it talks about finding ways to identify and analyze financial activity associated with domestic terrorists, including those through existing provisions of the Bank Secrecy Act.&nbsp; I&#8217;m curious what specifically would you be doing with the Bank Secrecy Act.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Yeah, thanks for the question.&nbsp; And, look, the Treasury Department has, under the Bank Secrecy Act and otherwise, some important authorities that help them be a part of the overall U.S. government approach to understanding illicit financial flows.&nbsp; That&#8217;s something we have tried to bring to bear with respect to counterterrorism, generally.&nbsp; It&#8217;s been a significant part of how we&#8217;ve made some progress in addressing international terrorist threats, like al Qaeda and ISIS and others since 9/11.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And as we ensure that we are bringing the full suite of tools &#8212; the appropriate ones &#8212; to bear on the domestic terrorism problem, there is, of course, the possibility that there may be those sorts of financial flows be identified, and once identified, the possibility they can be disrupted.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So that is, as with a number of pieces of this strategy, something whose full impact, I think, we&#8217;ll see as we move forward with implementation.&nbsp; (Inaudible) emphasize implementation is well underway, but in some ways, it takes time to see which pieces pay the biggest dividends.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>But I think what that is an acknowledgement of in the strategy is the role that Treasury can help play in identifying when funds are being used in illicit ways to support this, ultimately, unlawful activity.&nbsp; And to the extent that&#8217;s determined to be happening, they and law enforcement have various tools at their disposal to clamp down on that.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; I want to thank you all for joining us.&nbsp; We have to hop off now.&nbsp; Attorney General Garland will speak tomorrow morning at 11:00 a.m.&nbsp; I hope you&#8217;ll be able to tune into his speech.&nbsp; And other members of the Cabinet will also be participating in various events.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So, thanks again, and look forward to talking soon.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>7:35 P.M. EDT</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Europa Building, European Council<br>Brussels, Belgium</p>



<p>12:13 P.M. CEST</p>



<p>PRESIDENT MICHEL: &nbsp;Well, Mr. President, dear Joe, we are so pleased to welcome you in Brussels. &nbsp;You are back in Brussels, and America is back on the global scene. &nbsp;It’s great news. &nbsp;It’s great news for our Alliance. &nbsp;It’s also great news for the world. &nbsp;And we are really delighted to work with you in order to tackle, together, some important global challenges.</p>



<p>PRESIDENT BIDEN: &nbsp;Well, I think we have a great opportunity to work both with the EU, as well as NATO. &nbsp;And we’re &#8212; we&#8217;re feeling very good about it. &nbsp;We found the reception to be good, and I &#8212; and America is back. &nbsp;</p>



<p>We are &#8212; (inaudible) we&#8217;ve never fully left, but we are reasserting the fact that it’s overwhelmingly in the interest of the United States of America to have a great relationship with NATO and with the EU. &nbsp;I have a very different view than my predecessor did. &nbsp;</p>



<p>So, I’m looking forward to talking with you all about what we&#8217;re about to do, and &#8212; and I&#8217;m anxious to begin.</p>



<p>PRESIDENT VON DER LEYEN: &nbsp;And a very warm welcome for my part, too. &nbsp;What a pleasure to have you here. &nbsp;What an honor to have you here. &nbsp;</p>



<p>So, the fact that you are coming so early in your mandate, I think, underlines your personal attachment to Europe, and we really appreciate that.</p>



<p>And indeed, the last four years have not been easy. &nbsp;The world has dramatically changed. &nbsp;Europe has changed. &nbsp;But we wanted to reassure you: We are friends and allies and we are very much looking forward to working together. &nbsp;(Inaudible.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>PRESIDENT BIDEN: &nbsp;Well, what a great opportunity. &nbsp;(Inaudible.) &nbsp;Thank you.</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;Mr. President, did you agree on a Turkish presence in Afghanistan?</p>



<p>PRESIDENT BIDEN: &nbsp;Did I agree on a &#8212; what?</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;Turkish presence in Afghanistan, after you met with Mr. Erdoğan yesterday.&nbsp;</p>



<p>PRESIDENT BIDEN: &nbsp;Did I agree on a Turkish &#8212;</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;Did you discuss or agree on any kind of Turkish presence in Afghanistan after your withdrawal?</p>



<p>PRESIDENT BIDEN: &nbsp;Oh, we had &#8212; we had long discussions, and I feel very good about our meeting. &nbsp;And I’ll let the &#8212; I’ll let the Turks tell you about it.</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;Mr. President, do you have an agreement on Airbus and Boeing?</p>



<p>(The President crosses his fingers.)</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;Mr. President, what do you like about EU the most?</p>



<p>PRESIDENT BIDEN: &nbsp;I like the presidents. &nbsp;(Laughter.)&nbsp;</p>

<p>Today, the United States and the European Union made a major breakthrough in the Boeing-Airbus trade dispute, which has lasted more than 16 years. Both the U.S. and EU agreed to suspend our tariffs for five years, and we committed to ensuring a level playing field for our companies and our workers. Significantly, we also agreed to work together to challenge and counter China’s non-market practices in this sector that give China&#8217;s companies an unfair advantage. The U.S. and EU will work together in specific ways that reflect our high standards, including collaborating on inward and outbound investment and technology transfer. It’s a model we can build on for other challenges posed by China’s economic model.<br><br>This week, at the G7, at NATO, in my meeting with the leaders of the European Union, and in all my bilateral meetings with world leaders, I’ve been making the case that the U.S. and Europe—and democracies everywhere—are stronger when we work together to advance our shared values like fair competition and transparency. Today&#8217;s announcement demonstrates exactly how that can work in practice.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>United States and EU Reach Agreement to Address Shared Challenges from China</em></p>



<p><br>At the outset of his trip, the President was clear that his goal was to demonstrate the capacity of democracies to both meet the challenges and deter the threats of this new age. And, he was clear that he wanted to demonstrate that the United States could lead the world’s democracies in a foreign policy for the middle class. Today’s announcement that the US and European Union (EU) have reached an agreement in the Boeing-Airbus dispute and agreed to address shared challenges from China does just that. The US and EU will suspend tariffs for five years and work together to challenge and counter China’s non-market practices in this sector in specific ways that reflect our standards for fair competition. This includes collaboration on inward and outbound investment and tech transfer.  <br><br>Today’s agreement represents a model the US can build on for other challenges posed by China. The President routinely says that we are strongest when we work with our friends and allies — today’s announcement is a demonstration of that in action. <br><br>And, this deal will shore up the longer-term competitiveness and innovation of a key sector that is one of most important sources of middle-class jobs at home. The aerospace sector employs over 500,000 workers directly and supports over 700,000 jobs in related industries. Boeing itself employs over 140,000 workers across all 50 states. Through its supply chain, it purchases over a billion parts from over ten thousand American businesses.<br><br>The US and the EU are home to 780 million people who share democratic values and the largest economic relationship in the world. Together, we wrote the rules of the road based on democratic values, fair competition, and transparency after World War II and we need to work together to update these rules. This announcement comes on the day of the US-EU Summit, an opportunity to rebuild U.S.-EU ties, raise the ambition of the relationship, and commit to working together on the global stage.<br><br>The United States and the European Union agreed to a framework to promote a level playing field, overcome longstanding differences, and address common challenges — including our shared concerns with China’s unfair and coercive economic practices. The strengthening of our trade and investment relationship with the European Union is a top priority for the Administration, and our early efforts have been successful.<br><br>Both sides agreed to the following general principles to guide their future cooperation:<br><br><strong>Suspend the tariffs related to this dispute for five years. </strong>This signals a mutual determination to embark on a fresh start in the relationship. The agreement also retains flexibility for the United States to reapply tariffs if we’re no longer competing on a level playing field. <br><br><strong>Establish a Working Group to analyze and overcome any disagreements that may arise between the sides.</strong> The Working Group will collaborate on and continue discussing and developing these principles and appropriate actions. The Trade Ministers leading the Working Group will consult at least yearly. The Working Group will meet on request or at least every 6months.<br><br><strong>Ensure that our workers and industries can compete on a level playing field.</strong> The U.S. and EU agreed to clear statements on acceptable support for large civil aircraft producers that affirm the outcomes of the disputes and the intention of the parties to ensure that our workers and industries can compete on a level playing field.<br><br><strong>Confront the threat we face from China’s ambitions to build a sector upon non-market practices, including:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Meaningful cooperation on&nbsp;countering&nbsp;(1) investments in the EU and the United States by non-market actors, which can lead to the appropriation of technology; and (2) outward investments into China that are influenced by non-market forces.&nbsp;<br></li><li>Identifying where joint work is needed to take parallel action against non-market practices.<br></li><li>Sharing information regarding these and other areas&nbsp;to forge a common approach&nbsp;in the large civil aircraft sector.</li></ul>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Via Teleconference</p>



<p>11:09 A.M. CEST</p>



<p>MODERATOR: Good morning, everyone. Thank you so much for joining us today on this briefing with United States Trade Representative Ambassador Katherine Tai. This will be an on-the-record briefing, and it will be embargoed until the conclusion of the pool spray that will take place at the top of the U.S.-EU Summit meeting with President Biden.</p>



<p>By joining this call, you are agreeing to these ground rules. With that, I&#8217;m going to go ahead and pass it off to Ambassador Tai, who is here to provide you an update on some Boeing Airbus news.</p>



<p>Ambassador Tai, off to you.</p>



<p>AMBASSADOR TAI: Thank you so much, Vedant. Let me just do a tech check here and make sure that you can hear me.</p>



<p>MODERATOR: Loud and clear.</p>



<p>AMBASSADOR TAI: Super. Thank you. At the outset of this trip, the President has been clear that his goal is to demonstrate the capacity of democracies to both meet the challenges and deter the threats of this new age. And he was also clear that he wanted to demonstrate that the U.S. could lead the world’s democracies in a foreign policy for the middle class. Today’s announcement that the U.S. and EU have reached a 5-year agreement in the 16-year-long Boeing-Airbus dispute does just that.</p>



<p>Today’s announcement resolves a longstanding trade irritant in the U.S.-Europe relationship. Instead of fighting with one of our closest allies, we are finally coming together against a common threat. We agreed to work together to challenge and counter China’s non-market practices in this sector in specific ways that reflect our standards for fair competition. This includes collaboration on inward and outbound investment and technology transfer.</p>



<p>This is a model that we will use to build on for other challenges posed by China and non-market economic competition. The President routinely says that we are strongest when we work with our friends and allies. Today’s announcement is a demonstration of just that in action.</p>



<p>The U.S. and EU’s agreement marks significant progress towards achieving a long-term solution to this 16-year dispute. This deal will shore up the longer-term competitiveness and innovation of a key sector &#8212; aircraft &#8212; that is one of the most important sources of middle-class jobs at home.</p>



<p>The airspace sector employs over 500,000 workers directly and supports over 700,000 jobs in related industries. Boeing itself employs over 140,000 workers across all 50 of the United States. Through Boeing&#8217;s supply chain, it purchases over a billion parts from over 10,000 American businesses. Supporting Boeing means supporting good-paying jobs and a strong supply chain here at home.</p>



<p>The United States and the European Union are home to 780 million people who share democratic values and the largest economic relationship in the world. Together, after World War Two, the U.S. and countries in the EU wrote the rules of the road based on democratic values, fair competition, and transparency. The President believes that, today, we need to work once again with our like-minded allies to update these rules.</p>



<p>This agreement comes during the U.S.-EU Summit &#8212; an opportunity to rebuild the U.S.-EU ties, raise the ambition of our relationship, and commit to working together on common challenges.</p>



<p>A renewed trade and investment partnership with the European Union is a top priority for the administration, and our early efforts have been successful thanks to the work of President Biden and the rest of the administration.</p>



<p>This deal will ensure that our workers and companies in this key sector can compete on a level playing field. And this deal allows us to start turning the page on this longstanding dispute, to work together to address our shared concerns with unfair and coercive economic practices, and to ensure standards for fair competition.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m going to walk through part of this deal and try to be as clear as I can presenting this orally. As part of this deal, we have, first of all, suspended the U.S.-EU tariffs that were authorized by the WTO that are related to this dispute for a total of five years, while retaining flexibility for the United States &#8212; let me take a step back.</p>



<p>These tariffs will remain suspended so long as EU support for Airbus is consistent with the terms of this agreement. Should EU support cross a red line and U.S. producers are not able to compete fairly and on a level playing field, the United States retains the flexibility to reactivate the tariffs that are being suspended.</p>



<p>We have also, with the EU, agreed to clear statements on acceptable support for large civil aircraft producers and a cooperative process to address that support between our two parties and to overcome our longstanding differences.</p>



<p>With respect to China &#8212; this particular piece &#8212; we have committed to meaningful cooperation on countering investments in the aircraft sector by non-market actors in our economies to acquire technology know-how and also outward investments into China that are made pursuant to non-market forces.</p>



<p>We have also pledged to identify where joint work is needed to take parallel action against other non-market practices. And we have committed to sharing information regarding these and other areas to forego [sic] &#8212; sorry &#8212; to forge a common approach in the large civil aircraft sector.</p>



<p>Let me stop here and turn this back over to you, Vedant.</p>



<p>MODERATOR: Thanks so much, Ambassador Tai. The Ambassador has a very tight schedule and limited time, but is happy to take a couple of questions. So, if you have a question, please use the &#8220;raise hand&#8221; function on the Zoom interface, and we’ll get through what we can.</p>



<p>Why don’t we start with Jennifer Jacobs from Bloomberg. Please unmute yourself.</p>



<p>Q Good morning. Yes, can you say &#8212; will Airbus have to repay the subsidies? Will Airbus have to pay back those subsidies? And also when does the deal go into effect exactly?</p>



<p>AMBASSADOR TAI: So, this deal will go into effect, I think &#8212; let me take your second question first.</p>



<p>I mean, in terms of the particular interest with respect to the tariffs, as you know, on March 11, the U.S. and the EU agreed to a four-month suspension of the tariffs to create room for this negotiation and for this agreement to come together. So the implementation of this agreement will occur in terms of extending that suspension for five years by July 11.</p>



<p>Your other question relates to the Airbus subsidies. Now there are a number of subsidies, but, again, I’ll interpret your question related to ones that are outstanding. And the answer there is that the agreement provides for continued discussion between the parties on outstanding and current subsidies to Airbus for the existing aircraft, which remain a concern for the United States.</p>



<p>We’ll continue to confer to address these outstanding support measures.</p>



<p>MODERATOR: Thanks, Ambassador Tai.</p>



<p>Next, let’s go to Michael Shear with The New York Times.</p>



<p>Q Hey, thanks a lot. I guess I just wanted to know – you’ve talked about what the United States has agreed to do vis-à-vis the tariffs on the EU. I assume the agreement has the reciprocal &#8212; the same reciprocal agreement on their counter tariffs, correct?</p>



<p>AMBASSADOR TAI: That’s correct. And I’m sorry, I’m &#8212; I appreciate that when I say “we” &#8212; sometimes it’s unclear if I mean “we,” the United States, or “we,” the U.S. and the EU.</p>



<p>And that’s right, the commitment to extend the tariffs applies to both sides.</p>



<p>MODERATOR: Thanks so much, everybody. Unfortunately, that is all the time that we have this morning.</p>



<p>Again, as a reminder, this call was on the record, but embargoed until the conclusion of the pool spray that will take place at the top of the U.S.-EU Summit meeting with President Biden. Again, this is on the record, but embargoed until the conclusion of the pool spray at the top of the U.S.-EU meeting.</p>



<p>Thank you all for joining us, and we’ll talk to you all soon.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>On his first full day in office, President Biden directed his national security team to lead a 100-day comprehensive review of U.S. Government efforts to address domestic terrorism, which has evolved into the most urgent terrorism threat the United States faces today. As a result of that review, the Biden Administration is releasing the first-ever <strong><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/National-Strategy-for-Countering-Domestic-Terrorism.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Strategy for Countering Domestic Terrorism</a></strong> to address this challenge to America’s national security and improve the federal government’s response.</p>



<p>Domestic terrorism is not a new threat in the United States, yet it is a threat Americans have endured too often in recent years. The comprehensive strategy provides a nationwide framework for the U.S. Government and partners to understand and share domestic terrorism related information; prevent domestic terrorism recruitment and mobilization to violence; disrupt and deter domestic terrorism activity; and confront long term contributors to domestic terrorism. Our approach will protect both the nation and the civil liberties of its citizens.</p>



<p>Under Federal law, “<strong>domestic terrorism</strong>” is defined as “activities that involve acts dangerous to human life that are a violation of the criminal laws of the United States or of any State; appear to be intended to intimidate or coerce a civilian population, to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion, or to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping; and occur primarily within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States.”</p>



<p>The review was <strong>rooted in an expert assessment of the domestic terrorism threat</strong> provided by the intelligence and law enforcement communities. An unclassified summary of that assessment was released in March so the public could see the key findings. It found that the two most lethal elements of today’s domestic terrorism threat are (1) racially or ethnically motivated violent extremists who advocate for the superiority of the white race and (2) anti-government or anti-authority violent extremists, such as militia violent extremists.</p>



<p>To develop a government-wide strategy to counter domestic terrorists, the Biden Administration consulted extensively with a wide array of experts across the U.S. Government as well as with leaders in Congress, state and local governments, academia, civil society, religious communities, and foreign governments. Throughout the process, <strong>we embraced the protection of civil rights and civil liberties as a national security imperative</strong>. The strategy we are releasing today is carefully tailored to address violence and reduce the factors that lead to violence, threaten public safety, and infringe on the free expression of ideas. It is organized around four pillars – the core elements of how the Biden Administration will improve the U.S. Government’s response to this persistent, evolving, and lethal threat to our people, our democracy, and our national security:</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">PILLAR 1: UNDERSTAND AND SHARE DOMESTIC TERRORISM-RELATED INFORMATION</span></p>



<p><strong>The U.S. Government will enhance domestic terrorism analysis and improve information sharing throughout law enforcement </strong>at the federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial levels, and, where appropriate, private sector partners. The Department of Justice (DOJ) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) have implemented a robust system to methodically track domestic terrorism cases nationwide. The Department of State as well as the intelligence and law enforcement communities are learning more from foreign partners about the international dimensions of this threat.</p>



<p><br>The Department of State will continue to <strong>assess whether additional foreign entities linked to domestic terrorism can be designated </strong>as Foreign Terrorist Organizations or Specially Designated Global Terrorists under relevant statutory criteria. The Department of the Treasury, in coordination with law enforcement, is exploring ways to enhance the identification and analysis of financial activity of domestic terrorists. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is enhancing its analysis of open-source information to identify threats earlier and will create a structured mechanism for receiving and sharing within government credible non-governmental analysis.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">PILLAR 2: PREVENT DOMESTIC TERRORISM RECRUITMENT AND MOBILIZATION TO VIOLENCE</span></p>



<p>Drawing on the expertise of a variety of departments and agencies,<strong> the U.S. Government has revamped support to community partners who can help to prevent individuals from ever reaching the point of committing terrorist violence</strong>. The U.S. Government will<strong> strengthen domestic terrorism prevention resources</strong><strong>and services</strong>. For the first time, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has designated “Domestic Violent Extremism” as a National Priority Area within the Department’s Homeland Security Grant Program, which means that over $77 million will be allocated to state, local, tribal, and territorial partners to prevent, protect against, and respond to domestic violent extremism. DHS and FBI are working to strengthen local prevention, threat assessment, and threat management frameworks. The Department of Defense (DOD) is incorporating training for servicemembers separating or retiring from the military on potential targeting of those with military training by violent extremist actors. The U.S. Government will <strong>improve public awareness</strong> of federal resources to address concerning or threatening behavior before violence occurs.</p>



<p>The U.S. Government will augment its efforts to <strong>address online terrorist recruitment and mobilization to violence by domestic terrorists</strong> through increased information sharing with the technology sector and the creation of innovative ways to foster digital literacy and build resilience to recruitment and mobilization. <strong>The United States also recently joined the <em>Christchurch Call to Action to Eliminate Terrorist and Violent Extremist Content Online</em></strong>, an international partnership between governments and technology companies that works to develop new multilateral solutions to eliminating terrorist content online while safeguarding the freedom of online expression.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">PILLAR 3: DISRUPT AND DETER DOMESTIC TERRORISM ACTIVITY</span></p>



<p>The work of Federal law enforcement as well as our state, local, tribal, and territorial law enforcement partners is critical to countering domestic terrorism. The U.S. Government will increase<strong> support to Federal, state, and local law enforcement in addressing domestic terrorism nationwide</strong>. U.S. Attorney’s Offices and FBI field offices across the country have formally made domestic terrorism a top priority and are tracking comprehensively domestic terrorism-related cases, reallocating or requesting appropriate funding and resources as needed to target the threat. That includes over $100 million in additional resources for DOJ, FBI, and DHS included in the President’s Fiscal Year 2022 Budget to ensure that the Federal Government has the analysts, investigators, prosecutors, and other personnel and resources it needs to thwart domestic terrorism and do justice when the law has been broken. State, local, tribal, and territorial law enforcement will have access to increased intelligence sharing and training on domestic terrorism and associated threats. <strong>DOJ is closely examining whether new legislative authorities that balance safety and the protection of civil liberties are necessary and appropriate.<br><br></strong>The U.S. Government is improving employee screening to enhance methods for <strong>identifying domestic terrorists who might pose insider threats</strong>. The Office of Personnel Management will consider updates to the forms used to apply for sensitive roles in the Federal Government that could assist investigators in identifying potential domestic terrorism threats. DOD, DOJ, and DHS are similarly pursuing efforts to <strong>ensure domestic terrorists are not employed</strong> within our military or law enforcement ranks and improve screening and vetting processes. Training and resources will be developed for state, local, tribal, and territorial law enforcement partners as well as sensitive private sector partners to enable them to enhance their own employee screening programs and prevent individuals who pose domestic terrorism threats from being placed in positions of trust.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">PILLAR 4: CONFRONT LONG-TERM CONTRIBUTORS TO DOMESTIC TERRORISM</span></p>



<p><strong>Every component of the government has a role to play in rooting out racism and bigotry</strong> and advancing equity for all Americans. The U.S. Government, in close partnership with civil society, will <strong>address the long-term contributors that are responsible for much of today’s domestic terrorism.</strong> This includes reducing and protecting Americans from racial, ethnic, and religious hatred, and stemming the flow of firearms to individuals intending to commit acts of domestic terrorism. <strong>We will work to ensure that law enforcement operates without bias</strong> in countering domestic terrorism and provides for the public safety of all Americans. In a true democracy, <strong>violence cannot be an acceptable mode of seeking political or social change</strong>.</p>



<p>The U.S. Government is committed to <strong>strengthening trust in</strong> American democracy and its ability to deliver for the American people, including through relief and opportunity provided by the American Rescue Plan, the American Jobs Plan and the American Families Plan. The U.S. Government will also work to find ways to <strong>counter the polarization often fueled by disinformation, misinformation, and dangerous conspiracy theories online</strong>, supporting an information environment that fosters healthy democratic discourse.</p>



<p>In implementing this strategy, and at the direction of President Biden, we will remain focused on addressing violence and reducing the threat of violence while vigilantly safeguarding peaceful expression of a wide range of views and freedom of political association.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Domestic terrorism – driven by hate, bigotry, and other forms of extremism— is a stain on the soul of America. &nbsp;It goes against everything our country strives for and it poses a direct challenge to our national security, democracy, and unity.<br><br>To meet this serious and growing threat, on my first day in office I directed my national security team to confront the rise in domestic terrorism with the necessary resources and resolve.&nbsp; Today, I am releasing the first-ever National Strategy for Countering Domestic Terrorism.&nbsp; It lays out a comprehensive approach to protecting our nation from domestic terrorism while safeguarding our bedrock civil rights and civil liberties – values that make us who we are as Americans. &nbsp;We have to take both short-term steps to counter the very real threats of today and longer-term measures to diminish the drivers that will contribute to this ongoing challenge to our democracy.<br><br>This is a project that should unite all Americans.&nbsp; Together we must affirm that domestic terrorism has no place in our society.&nbsp; We must work to root out the hatreds that can too often drive violence.&nbsp; And we must recommit to defending and protecting our basic freedoms, which belong to all Americans in equal measure, and which are not only the foundation of our democracy – they are our enduring advantage in the world.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Via Teleconference</p>



<p>(June 14, 2021)</p>



<p>3:08 P.M. CEST</p>



<p>MODERATOR: Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you so much for joining us for this background briefing previewing tomorrow&#8217;s U.S.-EU Summit. This call will be on background, attributable to &#8220;senior administration officials,&#8221; embargoed until 7:00 a.m. Central European Summer Time tomorrow.</p>



<p>By joining this call, you are agreeing to these ground rules. Not for reporting or attribution, but just for your knowledge, on today&#8217;s call, we will have joining us [senior administration official].</p>



<p>Before we dive into the embargoed session of the preview of the U.S.-EU Summit, our speaker is going to also provide a brief, unembargoed, on-background update of some of President Biden&#8217;s engagements today at NATO, including the President&#8217;s meeting with Baltic leaders. So, I&#8217;ll turn it over to him to kick us off on that. [Senior administration official], go ahead.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Thanks, everybody, for joining the call. And greetings from NATO headquarters, where I&#8217;ve just stepped out of the session of the leaders here at the summit that is currently ongoing.</p>



<p>President Biden has delivered his remarks a short while ago, and other leaders are now speaking. On the margins of the NATO Summit, he had the opportunity to meet with the leaders of the three Baltic countries: Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. And he got the chance to discuss with them and coordinate with them in advance of his meeting with Putin on Wednesday to talk about the threat that Russia poses to NATO&#8217;s eastern flank, to talk about common commitment to Article 5 and collective defense, to coordinate on the resilience of those states in the face of multiple dimensions of the threat posed by Russia &#8212; from cyber, to provocative military exercises on their borders, to information warfare.</p>



<p>He was able to communicate to them what he has communicated publicly, which is that the United States seeks a stable and constructive relationship with Russia, but also will respond in the face of Russia&#8217;s harmful activities and will always stand up for NATO Allies.</p>



<p>They also discussed the emerging security challenge posed by China, including in the domain of technology. And he thanked the three leaders for the steps that they have taken to support a trusted 5G platform &#8212; to not accept Huawei within their systems.</p>



<p>They also had the opportunity to confer on Belarus and, in particular, the recent egregious air piracy that occurred with respect to a flight that was actually bound for Vilnius, Lithuania. And they had the opportunity to talk more broadly about and an affirmative agenda around emerging technologies and innovation.</p>



<p>It was a constructive, warm, vigorous engagement between him and the three leaders, and a real symbol of solidarity and unity with NATO&#8217;s eastern flank.</p>



<p>In that vein, he also had the opportunity to do a brief meeting with the Presidents of Poland and Romania, who are the co-chairs of the Bucharest Nine, the same group of eastern flank Allies that he engaged with at their virtual summit a few weeks ago. He was able to speak with the two of them about his commitment to (inaudible) security; his commitment, again, to stand up in the face of the threat posed by Russia; and to let them know his intentions for the summit in Geneva on Wednesday.</p>



<p>He had a separate encounter &#8212; an engagement with President Duda of Poland, where they got to go a little bit deeper into the questions of America&#8217;s security and military cooperation and engagement with Poland and the United States&#8217; strong support for the defense of Poland and our common collective commitment to NATO.</p>



<p>He had the chance to talk to a number of other leaders as well, just very briefly &#8212; from the Prime Minister of Spain to the Prime Minister of the Netherlands &#8212; on a range of different issues &#8212; and, of course, to see his colleagues who have just come with him from Cornwall and the G7 &#8212; President Macron, Chancellor Merkel, Prime Minister Draghi, Prime Minister Johnson.</p>



<p>So, that&#8217;s on that. And now, I will now switch to previewing tomorrow and the U.S.-EU Summit.</p>



<p>MODERATOR: And this preview is embargoed until 7:00 a.m. tomorrow &#8212; again, as a reminder to everyone. Go ahead.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: So, the U.S.-EU Summit is an opportunity for President Biden to meet with President Ursula von der Leyen and President Charles Michel to cover a broad-ranging agenda facing the United States and the European Union, from climate, to health, to foreign policy challenges, to the global economy.</p>



<p>One of the most significant outcomes of this meeting and a very important initiative that will serve as a platform for U.S.-EU cooperation in the years ahead will be the launch of a Trade and Technology Council.</p>



<p>The notion here is that the United States and Europe laid the foundation for the world economy after World War Two and now have to work together to write the rules of the road for the next generation, particularly in the areas of economics and emerging technologies.</p>



<p>The Trade and Technology Council will cover a number of significant areas of priority for both the United States and the European Union, from coordinating on standards for new technologies like artificial intelligence, quantum computing, biotechnology; to coordinating on supply chain resilience; to coordinating on import &#8212; or investment screening and export controls; to coordinating on how best to reform the WTO.</p>



<p>Addressing regulations of technology platforms, competition policy, the intersection between climate and trade &#8212; all of these will also be on the agenda for a Trade and Technology Council that will be co-chaired by Secretary Blinken, Secretary Raimondo, and Ambassador Tai.</p>



<p>So this will be a joint undertaking, at the President&#8217;s direction, by the State Department, the Department of Commerce, and the U.S. Trade Representative.</p>



<p>And the basic cadence of the Trade and Technology Council will be intensive work in all of these areas, leading to regular leader-level engagement to ratify outcomes and develop a common strategy and way forward.</p>



<p>The Trade and Technology Council is fundamentally about setting out an affirmative vision to the world rooted in our shared values and our shared economic interests.</p>



<p>Of course, we also have to take account of the fact that China poses a significant challenge in both of these areas. And dealing with China&#8217;s nonmarket practices, its economic abuses, and, of course, its efforts to shape the rules of the road on technology for the 21st century will be important &#8212; an important part of the work of this council.</p>



<p>And this fits with President Biden&#8217;s fundamental strategy of managing competition with China by coordinating closely with and developing common approaches with likeminded democratic partners and allies.</p>



<p>The summit will also cover the steps that the U.S. and the EU can take together to combat COVID-19 and prepare for the next pandemic. They will address and reinforce commitments announced at the Leaders Summit on Climate for how the U.S. and the EU can work together on the climate crisis.</p>



<p>And, of course, they will discuss a number of significant foreign policy challenges, including the Iranian nuclear issue, where the EU has played an important role over the course of the past several years.</p>



<p>The President will also, tomorrow, meet with the King of Belgium and the Prime Minister, and have the opportunity to speak to them about advancing all of the priorities in the bilateral relationship between the U.S. and Belgium.</p>



<p>Let me pause there for the moment, and I&#8217;d be happy to answer any of your questions.</p>



<p>MODERATOR: Thanks again, everyone. Everybody, by now, I&#8217;m sure, is quite familiar: Use this &#8220;raise hand&#8221; function on Zoom. Raise your hand, and we&#8217;ll try to get through a few questions before [senior administration official] has to run. So again, please use the &#8220;raise hand&#8221; function.</p>



<p>All right, why don&#8217;t we start with Franco Ordoñez with NPR.</p>



<p>Q Hey, sorry about that. I wanted to ask about &#8212; two questions, if I can. One, if you can give an update on discussions about steel and aluminum tariffs. What&#8217;s the status of those? Second question (inaudible): Do you expect that China will be mentioned in those &#8212; the joint statements, communiqués coming out of NATO and the EU? And how do you anticipate that will play back in the States in, you know, kind of making foreign policy work for domestic &#8212; you know, foreign policy being domestic policy for middle America. Thanks.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I&#8217;m sorry. Your first question, I couldn’t hear what you were asking. It cut out briefly. You were asking about the status of what?</p>



<p>Q So, I was hoping for an update on the President&#8217;s discussions or your &#8212; the administration&#8217;s discussions with Allies about steel and aluminum tariffs.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Oh, steel and &#8212; okay. Okay.</p>



<p>Q What&#8217;s the &#8212; what&#8217;s the status of those &#8212;</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yeah.</p>



<p>Q &#8212; and what progress you made?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: So, as you know, on the 232 tariffs, there was a determination made by the European Union not to raise tariffs as they had previously intended to do, to hold on for six months to provide time for the two sides to work together on the fundamental issue of overcapacity, and to come up with a common way forward to deal with what is &#8212; what is a challenge from China of dumping, subsidization, and overcapacity.</p>



<p>And so those negotiations and discussions are ongoing. They&#8217;ve been very constructive. They will take some time. So, I don&#8217;t anticipate that you&#8217;ll see an outcome this week on the 232 tariffs, but the direction of travel is positive, and we &#8212; we do believe that there is a way to resolve this that works for both the United States and the European Union.</p>



<p>In terms of the communiqués, the NATO communiqué will discuss China &#8212; that&#8217;s unusual &#8212; but (inaudible) Allies recognize that China represents a growing and evolving security challenge, as well as an economic and technology challenge to the Euro-Atlantic. And that will be reflected and spoken to in the &#8212; in the NATO communiqué.</p>



<p>Similarly, in the EU-U.S. Summit statement, China will be addressed, but I want to let the two leaders &#8212; or the three leaders &#8212; have the opportunity to consult and interact before I go further in previewing the precise outcome on China, although it certainly will be reflected &#8212; the agreement and convergence on issues related to China will be reflected in the summit outcome there.</p>



<p>And then, finally, on the foreign policy for the middle-class issue: You know, we took a huge step forward with the agreement on the global minimum tax, and the EU played a &#8212; an important role in getting there. That is &#8212; was one of the President&#8217;s biggest priorities in terms of delivering on foreign policy for the middle class.</p>



<p>And so, he will obviously consult with them on how we take the G7 commitment and bring on board the rest of the world in order to make that a full reality.</p>



<p>In other areas &#8212; from supply chain resilience, to competition policy, to how we deal with the issue of investment screening and intellectual property protection, and the nature of WTO reform so that the WTO is better protecting the rights of workers and middle-class communities in both the United States in Europe &#8212; across all of those dimensions, foreign policy for the middle class will be front and center in &#8212; in his dialogue with European Union leaders.</p>



<p>MODERATOR: Thanks so much. Next, let&#8217;s go to Yamiche Alcindor with PBS.</p>



<p>Q Hi, thanks so much for taking my question. I have a follow-up on the foreign policy for the middle class. Can you talk about anything else that &#8212; that hasn&#8217;t been mentioned that you want to highlight specifically as it relates to foreign policy and the middle class?</p>



<p>And another question I had was: Could you talk a little bit about how all of these summits work together? I think there are a lot of Americans who kind of see these summits and maybe &#8212; maybe even get a little confused about that there&#8217;s been G7 and EU. Obviously, there are different member nations &#8212;</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yeah.</p>



<p>Q &#8212; but I wonder how &#8212; you could talk a little bit about how they all work together.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Sure. So, the G7 &#8212; particularly in the format that came together in Cornwall, which was the G7+ &#8212; the G7 plus South Africa, India, Australia, and South Korea &#8212; reflects the world’s largest democracies from multiple continents coming together on strategic and economic issues to set out a vision for how democracies can deliver against the most significant challenges of our time, namely COVID-19 and future pandemics, climate change, economic opportunity, and economic fairness.</p>



<p>And they delivered particular, specific, tangible outcomes in each of those areas that, you know, that we spent the last three days describing &#8212; from the billion-dose commitment and the plan to end the pandemic, to the global minimum tax commitment, to the new Build Back Better World Partnership for infrastructure investment in low- and middle-income countries, to the collective commitment by the G7 to end overseas financing of coal by the end of this year.</p>



<p>So, the G7+ is really about the big global challenges and how democracies from around the world come together to solve them.</p>



<p>NATO is fundamentally about security &#8212; the security dimension of the Euro-Atlantic, the transatlantic partnership. And so, today is about issues like cyber and Russia and Afghanistan and &#8212; and the growing security challenge that China poses.</p>



<p>The U.S.-EU Summit is fundamentally about two very large economies. I mean, the European Union economy in &#8212; in total is about the size of the U.S. economy. And the fundamental decisions about that economy are made by the European Union in Brussels. And so, you got to have coordination between those two economies on a critical set of foundational issues in both trade and technology.</p>



<p>That has more of a direct negotiating element to it. The U.S. and the EU will, in fact, work out particular outcomes on particular issues, including the steel overcapacity issue I just described, including aligning export controls, including aligning climate policy.</p>



<p>And so, it has much more of a feeling of a bilateral dimension, even though the EU is comprised of more than two dozen states.</p>



<p>So, that&#8217;s how we think about the three. But they all fit together under a single banner, and that banner is: key democracies converging around a strategy for dealing both with great power competition and with solving the significant transnational challenges of our time.</p>



<p>And they each bring different vectors to doing that. But when you add up three summits, the whole &#8212; we believe &#8212; will be greater than the sum of its parts. It will be the United States rallying the world&#8217;s democracies around a tangible agenda to make real differences in the lives of the American people in terms of their health, their economic wellbeing, their physical security, and the planet that we live on.</p>



<p>In terms of other areas, with respect to foreign policy for the middle class, I’d just say maybe three or four things.</p>



<p>First, we believe that foreign policy for the middle class fundamentally comes down to the proposition that everything we do in our foreign policy should ultimately be judged by the metric of whether it is making life better, safer, and easier for families in the United States.</p>



<p>And against that metric, there&#8217;s a range of different priorities the President has been pursuing on this trip. One of them is to take the single-biggest impact on the lives and livelihoods of Americans in recent memory, which is a global pandemic, and say, “What can we put in place to make sure that does not happen again?”</p>



<p>Another has been to adjust our approach to trade so that we put the middle class at the center of it, rather than multinational corporations or making the world safe for corporate investment. And that has to do with everything from how we deal with currency policy, to tax policy, to protecting American supply chains in a way that builds manufacturing capacity and creates jobs in the United States, to protecting our intellectual property so that industries are not siphoned off and jobs are not siphoned off elsewhere.</p>



<p>So if you actually look across, particularly the G7 and the U.S.-EU Summit, you&#8217;ll see at the heart of both of those communiqués is the American middle class.</p>



<p>And we believe that what works for the American middle class also, frankly, ends up working for middle classes across Europe and around the world and that this is the most effective and sustainable way to pursue an international economic policy and a foreign policy more broadly.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ll stop there.</p>



<p>MODERATOR: Thanks. It looks like [senior administration official] probably has time for one more question, so why don&#8217;t we go to Andrew Restuccia with the Wall Street Journal?</p>



<p>Q Thanks, [senior administration official], for doing this. I was hoping you could speak to the issue of Afghanistan and whether any of the NATO members raised concerns with Biden about the withdrawal. And then separately, I would just ask, broadly, on behalf of the media here, if we could get these bilats on the schedule or delivered to the press because we were unaware of several of them today, and also that we could get some access to them, which has been a pretty tradition &#8212; a tradition of both parties in the past. Thanks.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yeah, on the second thing, you know, this was at the initiative of President Biden today that he wanted the opportunity to seek out key leaders, particularly on the eastern flank, to be sure he had the time &#8212; the opportunity to spend time with them, especially given the fact that for the key Western European countries, he&#8217;s just spent three days with them, and he wanted to maximize this opportunity to talk to the Poles, the Romanians, the (inaudible), et cetera. So, a lot of this was evolving in real time and there was not an effort to –- frankly, we would have loved to had &#8212; have more press access to them. But we’ll endeavor always to do better as we go forward.</p>



<p>In terms of Afghanistan, I listened –- I was in the room for the first hour of the summit and heard many of the significant troop-contributing countries speak and speak to the issue of Afghanistan. And each of them said that they ultimately agreed with the decision to come &#8212; to draw down this year. They understood that the time had come.</p>



<p>And the real focus in the room was not on the question of staying or going in 2021; the real focus was on how we work together as an Alliance to continue to provide support to the Afghan National Security Forces, the Afghan government, and the Afghan people.</p>



<p>And there is a considerable amount of practical work being done on that and strategic alignment on the desire to keep embassy presences, to maintain the necessary security to do that, and to work together as an alliance on everything from training &#8212; you know, particularly on over-the-horizon training; to counterterrorism and how we keep suppressing the terrorist threat in Afghanistan; to the provision of economic assistance in various forms to government.</p>



<p>So I&#8217;ve read some of the stories about this question of support or nonsupport for the drawdown from Afghanistan, and I&#8217;ve got to tell you that that is not the vibe in the room today. And, you know, it is &#8212; there is an incredible amount of warmth and unity around the entire agenda, including the &#8220;in together, out together&#8221; aspect of the Afghanistan drawdown.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Thanks so much, again, everybody, for taking the time and hopping on this call. Really appreciate it.</p>



<p>Again, the contents of this call will be embargoed until 7:00 a.m. Central European Summer Time, tomorrow, on background, from a senior administration official.</p>



<p>And we&#8217;ll talk to you all, again, more later today and tomorrow. Thank you.</p>

<p>The United States and the European Union represent 780 million people who share democratic values and the largest economic relationship in the world.  Together the U.S. and EU laid the foundations of the world economy and the rules-based international order after World War II.  We share a deep commitment and investment in the multilateral system, which was built based on enduring universal values, including the strong protection of human rights, and which remains indispensable to addressing global challenges.  The U.S. and EU also wrote the rules of the road based on openness, fair competition, transparency, and accountability.  The U.S.-EU Summit will begin the work of updating those rules—to protect our health, to protect our climate, and to ensure democracy delivers and technology improves our lives.<br><br>President Biden’s participation underscores the U.S. commitment to a strong Transatlantic partnership based on shared interests and values.  The United States is committed to working with the EU to ensure global health security, stimulate global economic recovery, tackle climate change, enhance digital and trade cooperation, strengthen democracy, and address mutual foreign policy concerns. <br><br><strong>Launching the U.S-EU Trade and Technology Council:</strong>  The leaders will launch the U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council to write the rules of the road for the economy of the 21st century. They will expand and deepen trade and investment ties, align key policies on technology and standards, launch a new initiative on biotechnology and genomics, and drive a digital transformation that boosts innovation and is based on democratic values. <br><br><strong>Fight and End the COVID-19 Pandemic and Drive a Sustainable Global Economic Recovery:</strong> The leaders will reiterate support for COVAX and commit to reforming the World Health Organization. They are also launching an expert working group to determine how best to reopen travel safely.<br><br><strong>Protect Our Planet and Foster Green Growth:</strong> The leaders will commit to leading by example in the fight against climate change, including by becoming net zero greenhouse gas economies by 2050.  They will re-affirm their commitment to the Paris Agreement, and to conserving at least 30 percent of land and sea areas by 2030. To this end, the U.S.-EU Climate Working Group will tackle climate change and environmental degradation, promote green growth, and urge ambitious action by all other major players. Additionally, the EU-US Energy Council will continue to coordinate on strategic energy issues, including decarbonization of the energy sector, energy security, and sustainable energy supply chains.<br><br><strong>Build a Stronger, More Democratic, and Peaceful World:</strong>  The leaders will commit to support democracy, uphold transparency, combat corruption, end forced labor, and protect the human rights of all people.  The U.S. will work with the EU on shared foreign policy priorities, including Belarus, China, the Eastern Mediterranean, Ethiopia, Iran, Russia, Venezuela, and the Western Balkans. They will launch U.S.-EU dialogues on Russia, on cyber issues, and migration.<br></p>
