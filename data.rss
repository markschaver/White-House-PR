<p class="has-text-align-center">Seward Park<br>Seattle, Washington</p>



<p>11:07 A.M. PDT<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Hello, everybody.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; My name is Joe Biden.&nbsp; I work for Patty Murray.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Been doing it for a long time.<br><br>I can’t think of a better place to celebrate Earth Day &#8212; this magnificent park.&nbsp; I’ve only been here once before.&nbsp; I came to speak years ago, and, on my own, I came up here to take a look.&nbsp; And it’s really quite beautiful.<br><br>Governor Inslee, who is known where I’m from as the “Environmental Governor,” and Mayor&nbsp;<s>Harley</s>&nbsp;[Harrell], Senator Murray, Senator Maria Cantwell, and all &#8212; I mean, you’ve got everybody here.&nbsp; You got Representatives Smith, Larsen, DelBene, Schrier.&nbsp; And it’s an honor to be here in this beautiful park with you all.<br><br>You know, Edward Abbey, the writer who once worked as a Park Ranger &#8212; I didn’t know he had been a Park Ranger, to tell you the truth &#8212; wrote the following: “Every man, every woman, carries in heart and mind [an] image of [an] ideal place, the right place, the one true home, known or unknown, actual or visionary.”<br><br>For many Seattle families, I think we’re in that place right now, here in this park and places like this.&nbsp; There are not that many like this, unfortunately.<br><br>And all around this country, there used to be a hell of a lot more forests like this.&nbsp; But we’re doing everything we can.&nbsp; Everybody behind me and all of you want desperately to protect what we have and increase what we have.<br><br>You know, our natural wonders are, you know, inspired &#8212; they’re a reflection that inspires us to take action.<br><br>You know, my mother had an expression &#8212; and I apologize to my colleagues, they’ve heard me do two things my whole career: quote my mother and father and quote Irish poets.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; But I’m not going to quote any Irish poets today, okay?&nbsp; But, you know, she’d say, “Out of everything difficult, something good will come if you look hard enough for it.”<br><br>And I think that we’re in one of those moments in world history and in American history where we’ve reached the point that the crisis on the environment has become so obvious, with the notable exception of the former President, that we &#8212; we really have an opportunity to do things we couldn&#8217;t have done 2, 5, 10 years ago.<br><br>And I want to &#8212; I want to talk about that today with leaders who understand that to their core, the folks standing behind me.&nbsp; I wish you didn&#8217;t have to stand.&nbsp; Don’t you guys have any chairs?&nbsp; (Laughter.)<br><br>AUDIENCE MEMBER:&nbsp; We’re good.<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; I’m not used to them standing for me, you know.&nbsp; Anyway.<br><br>But here&#8217;s the deal: As I said, Governor Inslee is the climate governor, and I&#8217;ve gone to him throughout asking him for advice and counsel.&nbsp; And thanks for welcoming me back to Washington State, Gov.&nbsp;<br><br>And to Mayor &#8212; Mayor Harrell, the passport to the city is very much appreciated.&nbsp; I hope I don&#8217;t do anything to have it revoked.&nbsp; (Laughs.)&nbsp;<br><br>And, Congressman Smith, thank you for your commitment to the environment, including helping our Armed Forces transition to clean energy technologies.&nbsp;<br><br>One of the things I found out as the President of the United States: I get to spend a lot of that money.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; I get to decide where &#8212; no, I&#8217;m not joking.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re going to completely &#8212; but before &#8212; we&#8217;re &#8212; I’m going to start the process where every vehicle in the United States military &#8212; every vehicle is going to be climate friendly.&nbsp; Every vehicle.&nbsp; We&#8217;re going to have &#8212; (applause) &#8212; no, I mean it.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; We’re spending billions of dollars to do it.&nbsp;<br><br>And &#8212; and it&#8217;s going to matter.&nbsp; You know, it matters.&nbsp; You know, in my view, this crisis, as I said, is a genuine opportunity &#8212; an opportunity to do things we wanted to do, and only now it’s become so apparent.&nbsp;<br><br>On this day, 52 years ago, millions of Americans of every age and background rallied together on Earth Day.&nbsp;<br><br>A guy I worked with as a young senator back in those days was a guy named Gaylord Nelson from Wisconsin.&nbsp; And the guy who helped organize Earth Day was a guy who was from Delaware and worked for me as well, and &#8212; Mike McCabe.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>And, you know, it was &#8212; they had a vision, a vision for a healthier and more prosperous America.&nbsp; And over time, they delivered.&nbsp; They delivered. &nbsp;Cleaner water.&nbsp; Proof that a sustainable environment can mean a stronger economy.&nbsp; You know, I &#8212; and one of the things I&#8217;m proudest of in our administration: Before I went into detail with my, quote, “Green Agenda,” I got all the unions together.&nbsp; Literally, got all the unions.&nbsp; (Inaudible) the unions view it as against their interests.<br><br>And starting with the IBEW Electrical, because they endorsed it.&nbsp; And every union has stepped up because they figured it out.&nbsp; Their jobs &#8212; they&#8217;re the ones who can help us transition in ways like never before.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not going to cost them jobs; it&#8217;s going to increase jobs.&nbsp; The IBEW is going to be building&nbsp;<s>50,000</s>[500,000] electric stations &#8212; electric charging stations all across America, for example.<br><br>And so, look, change continues today, and the new generation of Americans are helping us lead the way against the threat of climate change.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>You know, every time I get a little down &#8212; I don&#8217;t know about my colleagues; I suspect they’re the same &#8212; I just turn on a television or take a look at all the young people.&nbsp; This young generation is not going to put up with the &#8212; all that stuff.&nbsp; No, they’re not.&nbsp; I mean, they&#8217;re &#8212; they are really, really energized, whether it&#8217;s basic human rights or it&#8217;s the environment.&nbsp; They&#8217;re just not stopping.&nbsp; And from day one of my administration, we&#8217;ve stood with them.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Governor, I hate to admit it, but I was part of that early Earth Day.&nbsp; I was only seven years old, but &#8212; (laughter).&nbsp; God, I &#8212; oh, my Lord, I can&#8217;t even believe I said that.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>But anyway, it&#8217;s been a passion of mine as long as I&#8217;ve been involved in public life.&nbsp; The first thing &#8212; what got me involved in politics &#8212; not that it matters to you all, but I was thinking about it on the way over here.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; I was a young attorney in Delaware, and they wanted &#8212; across the top of my state, they wanted to connect two highways, and it’s through what is the most beautiful part of the state.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>But instead of being willing to do it in an area that, in fact, had no consequence for the environment, they decided to put it through areas that were &#8212; that were straighter and &#8212; but more damaging.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>And I got involved to try to stop the construction of that highway, which I did.&nbsp; That&#8217;s what got me involved.&nbsp; And it caused me great problems because I ended up having to run for the county council, which was the hardest job I ever had.&nbsp; (Inaudible.)&nbsp; At any rate &#8212;<br><br>But as a matter of fact, in 1986, in the United States Senate, I introduced and we passed the first Global Climate Protection Act &#8212; the first time &#8212; and it was a warming legislation in the Senate.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>And on Earth Day, you know, we convened last year over 40 leaders from around the globe, reasserting America&#8217;s leadership on climate after four years of an administration denying that there was a climate crisis, denying that there was any need to do anything about the environment.&nbsp;<br><br>And the commitments galvanized that meet- &#8212; at that meeting, including our own goal of cutting emissions from 50 to 52 percent below&nbsp;<s>‘25</s>[‘05] levels by 2030 and reaching net-zero emissions by 2050, taking the steps the United States needs to limit the planet&#8217;s warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius.&nbsp; And the rest of the world started to come along.&nbsp; We did more than set bold goals; we acted to achieve them.<br><br>Last year, with all the disappointments we faced &#8212; but last year, the United States deployed the most solar, wind, and battery storage in American history.&nbsp; And we made record-setting investments in clean energy in rural America.<br><br>For example, we have a $1 billion program that no one knows about except the Department of Agriculture &#8212; the grants and loans for farmers and rural co-ops to deploy solar and storage and powerlines to carry clean energy across the country.&nbsp;<br><br>We&#8217;re investing in technology so you can &#8212; you can heat and cool your home when the sun doesn&#8217;t shine and the wind doesn&#8217;t blow, because out here in Silicon Valley, you&#8217;re developing the battery technology I &#8212; they showed me one that is about a little bit wider than this podium, about that thick, and about this wide that, in fact, you can install in your home.&nbsp; And when the sun ain&#8217;t shining, that stored electricity runs the whole deal.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>And by the way &#8212; by the way, windmills don&#8217;t cause cancer.&nbsp; (Laughter.)<br><br>And across the country, we have enough clean energy capacity to power now 56 million homes.&nbsp;<br><br>Now, here&#8217;s what we&#8217;re doing with automobiles.&nbsp; I &#8212; I&#8217;m an automobile buff.&nbsp; I have a ‘68 Corvette that does nothing but pollute the air.&nbsp; But I don&#8217;t drive it very much.&nbsp; (Laughter.)<br><br>And &#8212; but I brought together the automobile manufacturers.&nbsp; And Mary&nbsp;<s>Berry</s>[Barra], who was &#8212; who runs General Motors, is a fine, fine person.&nbsp; At the time, she was suing the state of California &#8212; General Motors &#8212; for their increased mileage requirements that exceeded the federal standard &#8212; I mean, exceeded &#8212; yes, the federal standard.&nbsp; And the argument Ford &#8212; General Motors was making was you couldn&#8217;t exceed the federal standard locally.&nbsp;<br><br>And we had a long talk.&nbsp; And I didn&#8217;t suggest it, but she dropped that suit and contacted me and said, “I&#8217;m going to make a commitment.”&nbsp; I brought together the American automobile industry and they agreed on an ambitious goal: 50 percent electric vehicles by &#8212; sales by the year 2030.”&nbsp;<br><br>That&#8217;s the commitment they made.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t make it for them.&nbsp; They made it, because they realized what the future is.&nbsp;<br><br>I saw it when I drove Ford&#8217;s all-electric 150 pickup truck, which, I might add &#8212; this was disappointing &#8212; is faster than my Corvette.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Now, you think I&#8217;m kidding.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a (inaudible).&nbsp; You know, although I did suggest if I&#8217;m out of office and they had the first electric Corvette, I want to buy it.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; But at any rate, you know &#8212; and my &#8212; when I &#8212; I drove the electric Jeep Wagoneer around the South Lawn of the White House.&nbsp;<br><br>You know, to date, automakers have announced investments of more than $100 billion in EV manufacturing &#8212; $100 billion.&nbsp;<br><br>That’s along with us setting ambitious standards to cut pollution in cars and trucks to boost fuel economy standards, which we’re going to be announcing very soon, upping the mileage requirement that &#8212; for the minimum mileage requirement.&nbsp;<br><br>But that’s not all.&nbsp; The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law &#8212; which the folks behind me are the reason why that occurred &#8212; I signed provides billions of dollars for a nationwide network of 500,000 charging stations &#8212; 500,000.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>And will &#8212; and with electric school buses &#8212; by the way, I went down to North Carolina.&nbsp; You should see the factory down there.&nbsp; These buses &#8212; they have electric vehicles.&nbsp; It has a platform, folks, from me to you, about that thick; weighs about six zillion pounds.&nbsp; No engine.&nbsp; Nothing else.&nbsp; That’s it.&nbsp;<br><br>And &#8212; but it’s all electric.&nbsp; All electric.&nbsp; And guess what?&nbsp; We’re going to eliminate tens of thousands of diesel school buses, which pollute the air and pollute the lungs.&nbsp;<br><br>And, look, industry &#8212; this industry and union workers are all stepping up.&nbsp; And there&#8217;s a lot more.<br><br>Here in Washington State, you&#8217;re going to triple the federal commitment to your Link &#8212; we’re going to triple the federal commitment to your Link Light Rail system, speeding progress on the largest transit &#8212; (applause) &#8212; as my colleagues in the Senate will recall, I was referred to as “Mr. Amtrak.”&nbsp; I&#8217;ve taken over 1,200,000 miles in Amtrak commuting &#8212; commuting every single day &#8212; you think I’m joking &#8212; for 36 years every single day when the Senate was in session to go home and see my kids.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>And &#8212; but the folks &#8212; you know, it’s a simple proposition.&nbsp; Most people don’t realize it.&nbsp; Given a choice to go from point A to point B and rail &#8212; electric rail &#8212; or drive your automobile, if you can get there fast &#8212; as fast or faster on rail, you take the rail.&nbsp; The estimates take &#8212; will take millions of vehicles off the road.&nbsp; The largest transit construction project in the country that runs entirely on clean energy.<br><br>The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provides $66 billion &#8212; it’s passed &#8212; $66 billion for freight rail; $39 billion for public transit; $10.6 billion for clean electric buses; and $2.5 billion for clean ferries on my coast of Delaware and out here for you all.&nbsp;<br><br>This will take millions of cars worth of pollution off the road and get people to places quicker.<br><br>You know, look, I think one Amtrak train carries as many passengers &#8212; I know this statistic &#8212; as six lanes of a major interstate highway.&nbsp; That’s how many passengers it carries.&nbsp;<br><br>Look, it matters.<br><br>We saw new standards &#8212; we set new standards.&nbsp; We slashed methane and brought over 100 nations together when I was at the &#8212; at the big meeting we had in Europe.&nbsp; A hundred nations around the globe.&nbsp; And I got them to &#8212; I &#8212; there&#8217;s two things I was able to accomplish.&nbsp; One, I got a pledge &#8212; a pledge from a hundred &#8212; I think it was 144 of them &#8212; that they would eliminate methane and do the same thing we’re doing to keep it.&nbsp; It’s the most damaging of all the pollutants that are going up.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>We also set new standards for super-polluting HFC emissions.&nbsp; Remember the big fight we had?&nbsp; I know it, because when I almost lost an election because the DuPont company makes &#8212; long story.&nbsp; Anyway.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;<br><br>But, look, we set new standards for cleaner cement.&nbsp; You say, “What the hell are you talking about, Joey?”&nbsp; This is probably the only audience to understand &#8212; cleaner cement.&nbsp; Cement is an incredible pollutant &#8212; an incredible pollutant.&nbsp; And it matters because cement is responsible for 8 percent of the global climate emissions.&nbsp; Cement.&nbsp; I got to admit to you, as long as I&#8217;ve been involved in this, until two years ago, I didn&#8217;t know that.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re delivering across the country.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Lots of folks have promised it, but my administration is actually delivering and revitalizing communities across Appalachia.<br><br>Look, folks, I come from Scranton, Pennsylvania, where I was raised.&nbsp; The reason I got to Delaware is coal died.&nbsp; My dad was not in the coal mines; he was in sales &#8212; but the whole economy died.&nbsp; And, you know, you can understand why in places like West Virginia and Southeastern Pennsylvania, why people were worried about doing away with coal.&nbsp; You know, but it&#8217;s their jobs; they wonder what they&#8217;re going to do.&nbsp;<br><br>But guess what?&nbsp; In the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill, the law is going to help us cap and seal abandoned mines &#8212; thou- &#8212; there’s thousands of abandoned mines &#8212; cap and seal them.&nbsp; They’re no longer going to see pollution in the air or the water.&nbsp; The laws putting abandoned mine workers to work at the same salary they were working digging the mines in the first place.&nbsp; There are several thousand of these wells that have to be capped.&nbsp; And they have to harvest the energy.&nbsp; And they’re going to get paid.<br><br>So, we’ve provided alternatives.&nbsp; They are manufacturing and installing solar panels where they once dug for coal.<br><br>Look, here out &#8212; out here in the West, we are repowering retired power plants and clean ener- &#8212; clean hydrogen and advanced nuclear, making them economic hubs again.<br><br>And in the Heartland, in fields that feed our country, we’re planting cover crops to pull carbon out of the air and out of the atmosphere.&nbsp; You know, they’re becoming carbon sinks.&nbsp;<br><br>Look, across the country, we set the first-ever national conservation goal and protected more land and water than any other administration on record in our first year, because we can do it.&nbsp; And now the farmers are beginning to realize, “If I put things in conservation, I get paid for putting cover crops down that absorb carbon.&nbsp; It makes sense to me.”&nbsp; It keeps the land open, and it makes the environment much better.&nbsp; And they get paid for it.&nbsp; And they should get paid for it.&nbsp; It’s their land.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>We’re protecting natural wonders and cultural treasures, national monuments.&nbsp;<br><br>I remember a little girl came up to me with her &#8212; I don’t know where &#8212; how it happened, but I was walking outside and a woman came up with her little girl and said &#8212; she said, “Mr. Pwesident, please protect Bears Ears.”&nbsp; I said, “I beg your pardon, honey.”&nbsp; She said, “Please protect Bears Ears.”&nbsp; I said, “Bears Ears?”&nbsp; She said, “Yes.”&nbsp; And I knew what Bears Ears was because I’ve tried to take my kids to almost every national park.&nbsp; And I said, “Okay, honey.”&nbsp; She said, “Pwomise me.&nbsp; Pwomise me.”&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>And we did.&nbsp; Bears Ears.&nbsp; Forests like the Tongass Forest.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br><br>And, by the way, we got some of the conservative Republicans to support it in their state.&nbsp; We got some support for it.&nbsp;<br><br>And now we’re working to restore the salmon runs here in the Northwest.<br><br>Look, we’re putting America on the cutting edge.&nbsp; We’ve approved the first commercial-scale offshore wind project in federal waters, which has already broken ground with U.S workers and U.S. steel, who are going to be building these facilities.<br><br>By the way, I was up in &#8212; in Colorado and looking at the facilities we have there.&nbsp; You know, we now have &#8212; we now have windmills that the blades on those windmills &#8212; 102 yards long.&nbsp; You hear me?&nbsp; 102 yards long.&nbsp; They can be placed way out in the ocean.&nbsp; And, you know &#8212; and, by the way, I made it clear to my friends up in Nantucket and that area, “I don’t want to hear anymore about you don’t like looking at them.”&nbsp; (Laughter and applause.)&nbsp; They’re pretty.<br><br>But seriously.&nbsp; It’s incredible the breakthroughs that we’re making.&nbsp; Once you tell a nation that “We can do this, go do it,” it’s amazing what happens.&nbsp; It’s amazing what happens.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br><br>We’ve launched the first-ever commercial flight powered by 100 &#8212; 100 percent sustainable aviation fuel.&nbsp; It lifted off with fuel grown here in America.&nbsp; Grown in America.<br><br>We set the first net-zero commitments for U.S. steel companies, and now we’re rewarded for clean air &#8212; clean production through our first-ever international carbon-based trade deal, which makes clean American steel cheaper to buy than dirty steel from other countries.&nbsp; And we’re making it clear to the rest of the world that’s what we’re going to do.&nbsp;<br><br>We’ve put environmental justice at the center of what we do, addressing the disproportionate health, environmental, and economic impacts that have been borne primarily by communities of color &#8212; places too often left behind.<br><br>I grew up when &#8212; when coal died in Scranton, I moved &#8212; we moved to Delaware, where my dad had grown up.&nbsp; We moved to a little steel town called Claymont, Delaware, which was right at that arch that goes up into the Pennsylvania area there.&nbsp; And it’s near a place called Marcus Hook, where there were more &#8212; at the time, more oil refineries than in Houston &#8212; in Houston.&nbsp; Because of 10 million people in the Delaware Valley up there.<br><br>And I &#8212; we &#8212; I went to the small little school that was about a mile from the apartment complex we lived in, and &#8212; a little school called Holy Rosary.&nbsp; And I &#8212; you couldn’t walk to school because, although it was a four-lane access highway, it was just too dangerous to cross some of the streets.<br><br>And my mother would get &#8212; and when it came spring &#8212; I mean it became the fall &#8212; this is the God’s truth &#8212; and you’d get in the car, there’s a little frost on the window, turn on the windshield wiper, there’d be an oil slick.&nbsp; Not a joke.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>I have asthma, and 80 percent of the people who, in fact, we grew up with have asthma.&nbsp; That’s what you call a fenceline community.&nbsp; I understand what it’s like.&nbsp; I &#8212; we only lived there &#8212; I went to school there for 12 years.&nbsp; But I didn’t live there that whole time.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>My generic point is: If you take a look, my state used to be &#8212; thank God it&#8217;s no longer &#8212; had the highest cancer rate of any state in the nation because we have fenceline communities going down Route 9, and going down along the Delaware River &#8212; major facilities, oil plants, and the like.&nbsp; And the people that get hurt are the people who live on the other side of those fences.&nbsp;<br><br>I made a commitment: They’re the people who are going to get helped as we move this.&nbsp; They&#8217;re the people where the money is going to go to help their neighborhoods.&nbsp; They’re &#8212;<br><br>And this Bipartisan Infrastructure Law gives communities the money they need to get forever chemicals &#8212; PFAS &#8212; off &#8212; out of their water.&nbsp; They’re deadly, deadly.&nbsp; And a lot of it’s responsible because we, the government, and the fe- &#8212; and the military has engaged in activities that we didn’t realize how it was dangerous, over the years.&nbsp; But we’re going to get rid of it all.&nbsp;<br><br>We started replacing 100 percent &#8212; 100 percent of all the lead pipes and poison &#8212; that poison our water in America.&nbsp; Four hundred thousand schools and daycare centers &#8212; their kids can’t turn on that water without getting &#8212; or worried about there’s lead in that &#8212; in that water.&nbsp; Ten million homes in America and here in this city and this state.<br><br>Because every American and every child should be able to turn on a faucet and drink clean water, which will also create thousands of good-paying jobs for plumbers and pipefitters and others.&nbsp;<br><br>Look, look &#8212; all you got to do is look around: Cities and states are acting, businesses are acting, I&#8217;m acting.&nbsp; We need Congress to act as well.&nbsp; And the people behind me are pushing Congress hard.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; They are pushing Congress hard, calling them to pass new investments and tax credits aimed directly at lowering costs for families.&nbsp;<br><br>Look, you talk about, you know, a couple &#8212; there’s only two senators that occasionally don&#8217;t vote with me.&nbsp; That&#8217;s right, right?&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Literally, 48 &#8212; they talk about the split in the Democratic Party.&nbsp; There&#8217;s virtually no split in the Democratic Party.&nbsp; We just happen to have 50 presidents.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; You know, you have 50 senators and 50 Democrats and 50 Republicans.&nbsp; I mean, any one can change the dynamic.&nbsp; Right?&nbsp;<br><br>But all kidding aside, 48 percent of my Democratic colleagues in the Senate vote with me 94 percent of the time.&nbsp;&nbsp;So it&#8217;s not like we have a split, but we don&#8217;t have &#8212; we have virtually no Republicans.&nbsp;<br><br>There&#8217;s some.&nbsp; We get up to as many as seven or eight will vote.&nbsp; This ain&#8217;t your father&#8217;s Republican Party.&nbsp; Not &#8212; not a joke.&nbsp; All you got to do is look what is being played on &#8212; played this morning about the tape that was released.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Anyway.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>You know, but all kid- &#8212; kidding aside, this is the MAGA party now.&nbsp; It&#8217;s &#8212; you know, you got the senator from Texas and others.&nbsp; These guys are a different breed of cat.&nbsp; They&#8217;re not like what I served with for so many years.&nbsp;<br><br>And the people who know better are afraid to act correctly, because they know they&#8217;ll be primaried.&nbsp;<br><br>I&#8217;ve had &#8212; I won&#8217;t mention any of them; I promised I never would, and I won’t &#8212; but up to six come to me and say, “Joe, I want to be with you on such and such but I can&#8217;t.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll be primaried.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll lose my race.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll lose my race.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>So, folks, we got to &#8212; this is going to start to change.&nbsp;<br><br>Look, that bill that we talked about that is the infrastructure bill, there were two pieces of it.&nbsp; And it was one bill initially.&nbsp; And that bill had about 800,000 &#8212; $800 million in it for environmental-related issues.&nbsp;<br><br>Well, the one that didn&#8217;t pass &#8212; the part that didn&#8217;t pass yet is the one that has $531 million for environmental.&nbsp; But we got lot done though in the bill that passed, called the Infrastructure Bill, that has to do with the environment, including tax credits for purchases of electric and fuel-cell vehicles now &#8212; new or used.&nbsp;<br><br>But you’re going to save a typical driver about 80,000 &#8212; 8 &#8212; $80 a month from not having to pay gas at the pump.&nbsp; Tax credits for folks to buy solar panels and heat pumps and more efficient windows, saving each an average of $500 a year to do this &#8212; just making your home tighter so you don&#8217;t leak the heat and leak the air conditioning going out.<br><br>You know, and my pen is ready.&nbsp; My pen is ready to sign.&nbsp; I&#8217;m anxious to sign these.&nbsp; Get some of these bills to my desk.<br><br>And we can’t forget &#8212; (applause) &#8212; we can’t forget that achieving our ambitious climate goals is going to require nature itself to play a role.<br><br>You know, if you compare the map of North America in 1620 &#8212; and we have some of these maps &#8212; with America today, you’ll see much of our devas- &#8212; how much we’ve devastated our forests.&nbsp;<br><br>I mean, it used to be &#8212; if you’d look, from the Atlantic Coast almost to the Mississippi River was heavy forests, and we took it all down over those years.<br><br>That’s why today I&#8217;m signing an executive order to conserve our forests that do so much to protect us.&nbsp;<br><br>You know, our forests are our planet&#8217;s lungs.&nbsp; They literally are recycling and cycling CO2 out of the atmosphere.&nbsp; That&#8217;s what they do.&nbsp;<br><br>By the way, more the &#8212; I spent time down in the Amazon and in Colombia and in Brazil, and guess what?&nbsp; More carbon is taken out of the air in the Amazon &#8212; that carbon sink &#8212; than every bit of carbon that is generated on a daily basis in the entire United States from every source.&nbsp;<br><br>So what we should be doing and I&#8217;m trying to get done &#8212; and they&#8217;re not going to maybe like this &#8212; we should be paying the Brazilians not to cut down their forest.&nbsp; We got to cut ours down.&nbsp; We got to cut ours down.&nbsp; We got the benefit of it.&nbsp; Because we’ve got these third-world countries &#8212; not third world; some are &#8212; in Africa and in &#8212; and in South America &#8212; we got to &#8212; the industrial countries have to help.<br><br>Scientists estimate that the protection and restoration of our natural lands and waters can provide more than one third of the solution to climate change, just &#8212; just that, if we did nothing else.&nbsp;<br><br>So today, I&#8217;m about to sign an executive order to strengthen our forest on federal lands and make them and the local economies they support more resilient in the face of wildfires.&nbsp;<br><br>I&#8217;ve flown over every major wildfire in this country with FEMA since &#8212; not every; a couple I didn&#8217;t, but the vast majority of them &#8212; and it&#8217;s devastating.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve seen it from helicopters with FEMA just flying over here and Idaho.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t get to go to Oregon, but California.&nbsp; It&#8217;s absolutely devastating.&nbsp;<br><br>So we&#8217;re going to work with state and local and Tribal governments to map, catalog, and then conserve old-growth forests on our public lands.&nbsp;<br><br>These are the forests &#8212; (applause) &#8212; we&#8217;re going to do this.&nbsp; These are the forests that store, sequester incredible amounts of carbon, and help us fight climate change.&nbsp; The forests that are &#8212; are home to majestic trees, like the ones here in the &#8212; this park’s “Magnificent Forest.”&nbsp;<br><br>You know, the executive order I&#8217;m going to sign is going to make good on the international forest protection commitments from the proposal I made in Scotland, at&nbsp;<s>Glasgow</s>[COP] 26.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>I got 140 countries to sign up and say that, together &#8212; and we represent 90 percent of the world&#8217;s forest.&nbsp; And this includes our own effort to crack down on trafficking of illegal logged wood and prod- &#8212; and products like the ones illegally deforesting areas around the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>In addition to that, I put in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill a &#8212; that we&#8217;re going to plant 1.2 billion trees &#8212; 1.2 billion trees across this country to begin the vital work of reforesting America.&nbsp; It makes sense and it also makes a big difference &#8212; (applause) &#8212; including in our cities and on our city streets.&nbsp;<br><br>The executive order also recognizes that when it comes to protecting our communities from floods and storms, nature can help us as well.&nbsp; For example, when it comes to stopping flooding, sometimes a wetland is more effective than a seawall.&nbsp; I live along a state where it&#8217;s only &#8212; the average &#8212; three feet above sea level &#8212; the state of Delaware, the Delaware River, the Delaware Bay, and the Atlantic Ocean.&nbsp;<br><br>Well, you saw what happened, by the way, down on the Gulf.&nbsp; You saw what happened in Louisiana when they had that &#8212; you know, it matters whether that &#8212; there&#8217;s a wetlands.&nbsp; They&#8217;re significantly more consequential than seawalls.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>In order to help bring more of those nature-based solutions into our planning, we have to move quickly.<br><br>And with this executive order on Earth Day, we&#8217;re also showing this moment of maximum threat and urgency can also be a moment of enormous hope and enormous opportunity.&nbsp;<br><br>You know, that we &#8212; you know, that we carry “in heart and mind the image of the ideal place, the right place, the one true home, known or unknown, actual or visionary.”<br><br>I know you all feel it.&nbsp; And you wouldn&#8217;t be sitting here in the cold with your coats not on if you didn’t.&nbsp;<br><br>So I&#8217;m now going to sign this executive order.&nbsp; And I think we&#8217;re going to make &#8212; I just think this is the beginning of a new day.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re going to just have to overtake the opposition on this.&nbsp; I really mean it.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>So thank you all for being here.&nbsp; I&#8217;m going to sign this executive order.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br><br>“Strengthening the Nations Forests, Communities, and Local Economies”.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s all about planting about 1,200,000,000 trees.&nbsp;<br><br>So &#8212; and, by the way, anybody bring their shovels?&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; All right.<br><br>(The executive order is signed.)&nbsp;<br><br>Is this a state park or is this a city park?<br><br>GOVERNOR INSLEE:&nbsp; City.&nbsp;<br><br>MAYOR HARRELL:&nbsp; City park.<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Mr. Mayor?&nbsp;<br><br>MAYOR HARRELL:&nbsp; Yes, sir?<br><br>SECRETARY HAALAND:&nbsp; On Tribal land!&nbsp; (Laughter.)<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Let me give you this.&nbsp;<br><br>GOVERNOR INSLEE:&nbsp; Right here.&nbsp; Right here.&nbsp; He’s right behind you.&nbsp;<br><br>(Signing pen is handed to the Mayor.)<br><br>MAYOR HARRELL:&nbsp; Thank you.<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; There you go.&nbsp;<br><br>And, by the way, notice who runs the Department of Interior now.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>All right.&nbsp; Well, thanks.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>11:37 A.M.

					<description><![CDATA[By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows: Section&#160;1.&#160;&#160;Policy.&#160;&#160;Strengthening&#160;America&#8217;s forests, which are home to cherished expanses of mature and old-growth forests on Federal lands, is critical to the health, prosperity, and resilience of our communities &#8212; particularly&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>



<p>Section&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Policy.&nbsp;&nbsp;Strengthening&nbsp;America&#8217;s forests, which are home to cherished expanses of mature and old-growth forests on Federal lands, is critical to the health, prosperity, and resilience of our communities &#8212; particularly in light of the threat of catastrophic wildfires.&nbsp;&nbsp;Forests provide clean air and&nbsp;water, sustain the plant and animal life fundamental to combating the global climate and biodiversity crises, and hold special importance to Tribal Nations.&nbsp;&nbsp;We go to these special places to hike, camp, hunt, fish, and engage in recreation that revitalizes our souls and connects us to history and nature.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many local economies thrive because of these outdoor and forest management activities, including in the sustainable forest product sector.</p>



<p>Globally, forests represent some of the most biodiverse parts of our planet and play an irreplaceable role in reaching net-zero greenhouse gas emissions.&nbsp;Terrestrial carbon sinks absorb around 30 percent of the carbon dioxide emitted by human activities each year.&nbsp;&nbsp;Here at home, America&#8217;s forests absorb more than 10 percent of annual United States economy-wide greenhouse gas emissions.&nbsp;&nbsp;Conserving old-growth and mature forests on Federal lands while supporting and advancing climate-smart forestry and sustainable forest products is critical to protecting these and other ecosystem services provided by those forests.</p>



<p>Despite their importance, the world&#8217;s forests are quickly disappearing; only a small fraction of the world&#8217;s mature and old-growth forests remains.&nbsp;&nbsp;Here at home, the primary threats to forests, including mature and old-growth forests, include climate impacts, catastrophic wildfires, insect infestation, and disease.&nbsp;&nbsp;We can and must take action to conserve, restore, reforest, and manage our magnificent forests here at home and, working closely with international partners, throughout the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is the policy of my Administration, in consultation with State, local, Tribal, and territorial governments, as well as the private sector, nonprofit organizations, labor unions, and the scientific community, to pursue science-based, sustainable forest and land management; conserve America&#8217;s mature and old-growth forests on Federal lands; invest in forest health and restoration; support<a> </a>indigenous traditional ecological knowledge and cultural and subsistencepractices; honor Tribal treaty rights; and deploy climate-smart forestry practices and other nature-based solutions to improve the resilience of our lands, waters, wildlife, and communities in the face of increasing disturbances and chronic stress arising from climate impacts.  It is also the policy of my Administration, as outlined in <em>Conserving and Restoring America the Beautifu</em>l, to support collaborative, locally led conservation solutions.</p>



<p>The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) I signed into law provides generational investments in ecosystem restoration and wildfire risk reduction.  As we use this funding, we will seek opportunities, consistent with the IIJA, to conserve our mature and old-growth forests on Federal lands and restore the health and vibrancy of our Nation&#8217;s forests by reducing the threat of catastrophic wildfires through ecological treatments that create resilient forest conditions using active, science-based forest management and prescribed fires; by incorporating indigenous traditional ecological knowledge; and by scaling up and optimizing climate-smart reforestation.  My Administration also is committed to doing its part to combat deforestation around the world and to working with our international partners toward sustainable management of the world&#8217;s lands, waters, and ocean.</p>



<p>Sec. 2.  Restoring and Conserving the Nation&#8217;s Forests, Including Mature and Old-Growth Forests.  My Administration will manage forests on Federal lands, which include many mature and old-growth forests, to promote their continued health and resilience; retain and enhance carbon storage; conserve biodiversity; mitigate the risk of wildfires; enhance climate resilience; enable subsistence and cultural uses; provide outdoor recreational opportunities; and promote sustainable local economic development.  Science—based reforestation is one of the greatest opportunities both globally and in the United States for the land sector to contribute to climate and biodiversity goals.  To further conserve mature and old-growth forests and foster long-term United States forest health through climate-smart reforestation for the benefit of Americans today and for generations to come, the following actions shall be taken, in consultation with State, local, Tribal, and territorial governments and the public, and to the extent consistent with applicable law: </p>



<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;The Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture (Secretaries) &#8212; the Federal Government&#8217;s primary land managers &#8212; shall continue to jointly pursue wildfire mitigation strategies, which are already driving important actions to confront a pressing threat to mature and old-growth forests on Federal lands:&nbsp;&nbsp;catastrophic wildfires driven by decades of fire exclusion and climate change.</p>



<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;The Secretary of the Interior, with respect to public lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management, and the Secretary of Agriculture, with respect to National Forest System lands, shall, within 1 year of the date of this order, define, identify, and complete an inventory of&nbsp;old-growth and mature forests on Federal lands, accounting for regional and ecological variations, as appropriate, and shall make such inventory publicly available.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;Following completion of the inventory, the Secretaries shall:</p>



<p>(i)    coordinate conservation and wildfire risk reduction activities, including consideration of climate-smart stewardship of mature and old-growth forests, with other executive departments and agencies (agencies), States, Tribal Nations, and any private landowners who volunteer to participate;</p>



<p>(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;analyze the threats to mature and old-growth forests on Federal lands, including from wildfires and climate change; and</p>



<p>(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;develop policies, with robust opportunity for public comment, to institutionalize climate-smart management and conservation strategies that address threats to mature and old-growth forests on Federal lands.</p>



<p>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;The Secretaries, in coordination with the heads of other agencies as appropriate, shall within 1 year of the date of this order:</p>



<p>(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;develop a Federal goal that charges agencies to meet agency-specific reforestation targets by 2030,&nbsp;including an assessment of reforestation opportunities on Federal lands and through existing Federal programs and partnerships;</p>



<p>(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;develop, in&nbsp;collaboration with Federal, State, Tribal, and private-sector partners,&nbsp;a climate-informed plan (building on existing efforts) to&nbsp;increase Federal cone and seed collection and to ensure seed and seedling nursery capacity is sufficient to meet anticipated reforestation demand;&nbsp;and</p>



<p>(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;develop, in coordination with the Secretary of Commerce, with State, local, Tribal, and territorial governments, and with the private sector, nonprofit organizations, labor unions, and the scientific community, recommendations for community-led local and regional economic development opportunities to create and sustain jobs in the sustainable forest product sector, including innovative materials, and in outdoor recreation, while supporting healthy, sustainably managed forests in timber communities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sec.&nbsp;3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Stopping International Deforestation.&nbsp;&nbsp;As described in the&nbsp;<em>Plan to Conserve Global Forests:&nbsp;&nbsp;Critical Carbon Sinks</em>, my Administration has committed to deliver, by 2030, on collective global goals to end natural forest loss and to restore at least an additional 200 million hectares of forests and other ecosystems, while showcasing new economic models that reflect the services provided by critical ecosystems around the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;The plan recognizes that conserving and restoring global forest and peatland ecosystems, particularly in the Amazon, Congo Basin, and Southeast Asia, can provide significant global greenhouse gas emissions mitigation, both by preventing the emissions caused by deforestation and by increasing the amount of carbon dioxide captured from the atmosphere and stored in soils and forest biomass.&nbsp;&nbsp;My&nbsp;Administration is also committed to combating illegal logging and stopping trade in illegally sourced wood products pursuant to the Lacey Act, as amended, 16 U.S.C. 3371&nbsp;<em>et seq.</em>, and to addressing the related importation of commodities sourced from recently deforested land.&nbsp;&nbsp;To further advance these commitments, conserve these critical ecosystems, and address drivers of global deforestation &#8212; including illegal forest clearing to produce agricultural commodities &#8212; the following actions shall be taken:</p>



<p>(a)  within 1 year of the date of this order, the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Homeland Security (through the Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection), the Administrator of the Small Business Administration, the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development, the United States Trade Representative, and the Special Presidential Envoy for Climate, shall submit a report to the President evaluating options, including recommendations for proposed legislation, for a whole-of-government approach to combating international deforestation that includes:</p>



<p>(i)   an analysis of the feasibility of limiting or removing specific commodities grown on lands deforested either illegally or after December 31, 2020, from agricultural supply chains; and</p>



<p>(ii)  an analysis of the potential for public-private partnerships with major agricultural commodity buyers, traders, financial institutions, and other actors to voluntarily reduce or eliminate the purchase of such commodities and incentivize sourcing of sustainably produced agricultural commodities. </p>



<p>(b)  within 1 year of the date of this order, the Secretary of State, in coordination with other appropriate agencies, shall submit a report to the President on how agencies that engage in international programming, assistance, finance, investment, trade, and trade promotion, can, consistent with applicable law, accomplish the following:</p>



<p>(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;incorporate the assessment of risk of deforestation and other land conversion into guidance on foreign assistance and&nbsp;investmentprogramming related to infrastructure development, agriculture, settlements, land use planning or zoning, and energy siting and generation;</p>



<p>(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;address deforestation and land conversion risk in new relevant trade agreements and seek to address such risks, where possible, in the implementation of existing trade agreements;</p>



<p>(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;identify and engage in international processes and fora, as appropriate, to&nbsp;pursue approaches to combat deforestation and enhance sustainable land use opportunities in preparing climate, development, and finance strategies;</p>



<p>(iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;engage other major commodity-importing and commodity-producing countries to advance common interests in addressing commodity-driven deforestation; and</p>



<p>(v)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;assess options to direct foreign assistance and other agency programs and tools, as appropriate, to help threatened forest communities transition to an economically sustainable future, with special attention to the participation of and the critical role played by indigenous peoples and local communities and landholders in protecting and restoring forests and in reducing deforestation and forest degradation.</p>



<p>Sec.&nbsp;4.&nbsp;&nbsp;Deploying Nature-Based Solutions to Tackle Climate Change and Enhance Resilience.&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as forest conservation, restoration, and adaptation&nbsp;generate broad benefits related to climate change and other areas, other nature-based solutions can&nbsp;advance&nbsp;multiple benefits.&nbsp;&nbsp;These solutions include actions that protect coasts and critical marine ecosystems, reduce flooding, moderate extreme heat, replenish groundwater sources, capture and store carbon dioxide, conserve biodiversity, and improve the productivity of agricultural and forest lands to produce food and fiber.&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure that agencies pursue nature-based solutions, to the extent consistent with applicable law and supported by science, the following actions shall be taken:</p>



<p>(a)  The Chair of the Council on Environmental Quality, the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, and the Assistant to the President and National Climate Advisor shall, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense (through the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works), the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary of Commerce (through the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration), the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, the Secretary of Transportation, the Secretary of Energy, the Secretary of Homeland Security (through the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency), the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Administrator of the Small Business Administration, and the heads of other agencies as appropriate, submit a report to the National Climate Task Force to identify key opportunities for greater deployment of nature-based solutions across the Federal Government, including through potential policy, guidance, and program changes. </p>



<p>(b)  The Director of the Office of Management and Budget shall issue guidance related to the valuation of ecosystem and environmental services and natural assets in Federal regulatory decision-making, consistent with the efforts to modernize regulatory review required by my Presidential Memorandum of January 20, 2021 (Modernizing Regulatory Review).</p>



<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;Implementation of the United States Global Change Research Program shall include an assessment of the condition of nature within the United States in a report carrying out section&nbsp;102 of the Global Change Research Act of 1990, 15 U.S.C. 2932.</p>



<p>Sec.&nbsp;5.&nbsp;&nbsp;General Provisions.&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:</p>



<p>(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or</p>



<p>(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;the functions of the Director of the Office of&nbsp;Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.</p>



<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.</p>



<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-right">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>On <em>Yom HaShoah</em>, Holocaust Remembrance Day, and throughout this week of remembrance, we reflect on the horrors of the Holocaust when the Nazi regime systematically murdered 6 million Jews and millions of other innocents, including Roma, Sinti, Slavs, persons with disabilities, LGBTQI+ individuals, political dissidents, and many others.&nbsp; We stand with Jewish people in the United States, Israel, and around the world in grieving one of the darkest chapters in history.&nbsp; We honor the memories of the victims. &nbsp;We embrace the survivors. &nbsp;We commit to keeping alive the promise of &#8220;never again.&#8221;</p>



<p>The world must never forget the truth of what happened across Europe during the Holocaust or forget the horrific crimes and suffering the Nazi regime inflicted on millions of innocent people.  Entire families were wiped out.  Communities were shattered.  Survivors were left with agonizing memories and fading tattoos etched into their skin by the Nazis, reducing them to numbers.  It is forever recorded into the history of mankind, and it is the shared responsibility of us all to ensure that the <em>Shoah</em> is never erased from our collective memory &#8212; especially as fewer and fewer survivors remain.  The truth must always be known and shared with future generations in perpetuity.</p>



<p>I have taught my own children and grandchildren about the horrors of the Holocaust, just as my father taught me.  I have taken my family to bear witness to the darkness at the Dachau concentration camp so that they could understand why we must always speak out against antisemitism and hatred in all of its pernicious forms.  The legacy of the Holocaust must always remind us that silence in the face of such bigotry is complicity.</p>



<p>Remembrance is our eternal duty, but remembrance without action risks becoming an empty ritual.  As individuals, we must never be indifferent to human cruelty and human suffering.  As nations, we must stand together across the international community against antisemitism, which is once again rearing its ugly head around the world.  We must combat other forms of hatred and educate new generations about the Holocaust.  We must reject those who try to deny the Holocaust or to distort its history for their own ends.  We recognize that, just as the Holocaust was an act of pure antisemitism, so too Holocaust denial is a form of antisemitism.  We watch with dismay as the term &#8220;Nazi&#8221; is deployed to make flawed historical parallels.  Efforts to minimize, distort, or blur who the Nazis were and the genocide they perpetrated are a form of Holocaust denial and, in addition to insulting both the victims and survivors of the Holocaust, spread antisemitism.</p>



<p>My Administration has stepped up our efforts to counter all the ugly forms antisemitism can take, including Holocaust denial and distortion.  We co-sponsored a United Nations resolution that charged the international community with combating Holocaust denial through education.  We are partnering with the German government to improve Holocaust education and counter Holocaust denial and distortion.  A renowned scholar of the Holocaust and antisemitism, Deborah Lipstadt, was recently confirmed as Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Antisemitism.</p>



<p>In addition to speaking out against the evils of antisemitism, I signed &#8212; and my Administration continues to implement &#8212; legislation that gives us more tools to combat crimes that are based on a victim&#8217;s actual or perceived race, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity or disability.  We issued the first-ever National Strategy for Countering Domestic Terrorism.  My Administration has implemented increased funding for a program that helps threatened nonprofits &#8212; including houses of worship and other religious affiliated entities &#8212; to improve their safety and security.  On International Holocaust Remembrance Day, I met with Bronia Brandman and the Vice President met with Ruth Cohen &#8212; both Auschwitz survivors &#8212; at the White House so we could bear witness to their stories, combat Holocaust denial and distortion, and give life to the lessons of that most terrible period in human history.</p>



<p>Those like Bronia and Ruth who survived the Holocaust and went on to build new lives inspire our Nation and the world, and they are living testaments to the enduring resilience of the human spirit.  It is the responsibility of all of us to recognize the pain that they carry and to support them by ensuring that the cruelty of the Holocaust is never forgotten.  Today and every day, we stand against antisemitism and all other forms of hate and continue our work to ensure that everyone can live in a world that safeguards the fundamental human dignity of all people.  </p>



<p>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 24 through May 1, 2022, as a week of observance of the Days of Remembrance of Victims of the Holocaust, and call upon the people of the United States to observe this week and pause to remember victims and survivors of the Holocaust.</p>



<p>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-second day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-sixth.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>Forty years ago, the President&#8217;s Task Force on Victims of Crime was established to help those who had experienced crime and their families &#8212; an important step toward the protection of and support for victims&#8217; rights.&nbsp; Over the years, crime victims&#8217; rights have evolved.&nbsp; Dedicated professionals have worked to develop support and services for survivors that are more holistic, trauma-informed, and effective at overcoming systemic barriers that certain communities face in prosecuting offenders and obtaining justice.&nbsp; However, more work remains to be done to&nbsp;advance these goals. &nbsp;During National Crime Victims&#8217; Rights Week, our Nation renews our commitment to providing survivors of crime the support they need to heal. &nbsp;We honor the dedicated victim service providers who support crime victims, and we continue to advance this important cause for all people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Delivering true justice requires that we provide all victims with the support they need.  Persistent barriers still prevent many survivors from receiving the services they need and the justice they deserve.  Many crimes &#8212; including violent crimes, such as rape and sexual assault &#8212; often go unreported to law enforcement because, among other concerns, victims fear placing themselves in further danger and negative interactions with the criminal justice system.  My Administration is also working to tackle the epidemic of gun violence, which is a public health and public safety crisis.  In the absence of necessary Congressional action, my Administration is taking action to get illegal guns &#8212; and those who would use them to commit crimes &#8212; off of our streets. </p>



<p>Victims of crime not only face physical and emotional costs, they often suffer a serious economic toll as well, and this is another area in which my Administration is making progress.  The Crime Victims Fund, established through the Victims of Crime Act (VOCA), helps provide critical resources for victim services and victim compensation programs throughout the country.  That is why, last July, I signed the VOCA Fix to Sustain the Crime Victim Fund Act into law to strengthen VOCA and increase the revenues to support survivors of crime and victim services organizations.  My Administration is supporting innovative programs like sexual assault telehealth services and hospital-based victim assistance, enabling providers to quickly reach more survivors and reduce repeated victimization.  I am also proud to have recently signed into law the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), which funds programs that provide services to survivors of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking.  This reauthorization of VAWA also expands the rights of victims of technology-facilitated gender-based violence and also includes historic Tribal provisions to protect Native communities and help them pursue justice. </p>



<p>Strengthening public safety also means addressing the trauma and inequality of victimization experienced by communities of color, Native American communities, the LGBTQI+ community, the Asian American community, and other historically marginalized groups.  People of color suffer higher rates of victimization, and violence is disproportionally concentrated in neighborhoods that have been harmed persistently by racial discrimination, segregation, redlining, and disinvestment.  Breaking the cycle of violence enhances public safety, public health, and equity.  We also know that members of the LGBTQI+ community are more likely to be victims of violent crime.  </p>



<p>My Administration is committed to using all tools at our disposal to ensure every survivor of crime has equal access to the resources and services they need to recover from their ordeals and regain a feeling of safety.  To address a surge in hate crimes and bias-motivated attacks &#8212; and to provide law enforcement with the resources to identify and investigate hate crimes, I signed the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act into law.  As part of this law, we have funded a new Center for Culturally Responsive Victim Services to help local programs better serve historically marginalized communities.  </p>



<p> In addition to supporting crime victims, we must also hold offenders accountable.  That is why the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security are committed to investigating and enforcing our criminal and civil laws and ensuring that Federal, State, local, territorial, and Tribal law enforcement officers and prosecutors receive the training and resources they need to deliver justice to victims.</p>



<p> It takes enormous courage and extraordinary strength to emerge from life&#8217;s most painful moments.  As a Nation, let us all work together to stop crimes before they happen and to give victims the support they need to restore a sense of trust and safety and to move toward healing and justice.</p>



<p>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 24 through April 30, 2022, National Crime Victims&#8217; Rights Week.  I call upon all Americans to observe this week by participating in events that raise awareness of victims&#8217; rights and services and by volunteering to serve victims in their time of need.</p>



<p>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-second day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-sixth.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-right">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.</p>

<p>President Biden is announcing five new nominees to serve as U.S. Attorneys across the country, as wel as three new nominees to serve as U.S. Marshals. These are officials who will be indispensable to upholding the rule of law as top federal law enforcement officials.</p>



<p>These individuals were chosen for their devotion to enforcing the law, their professionalism, their experience and credentials in this field, their dedication to pursuing equal justice for all, and their commitment to the independence of the Department of Justice.</p>



<p>The President has proposed a budget that would significantly increase funding for law enforcement as part of a comprehensive approach to tackling the rising crime rate this administration inherited last year.</p>



<p>The President has also launched a comprehensive effort to take on the uptick in gun crime that has been taking place since 2020—putting more cops on the beat, supporting community prevention programs, and cracking down on illegal gun trafficking. Confirming U.S. Attorneys as the chief federal law enforcement officers in their district is important for these efforts.</p>



<p>The President has now announced 48 nominees to serve as U.S. Attorneys, and 5 nominees to serve as U.S. Marshals.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/20/executive-order-advancing-racial-equity-and-support-for-underserved-communities-through-the-federal-government/">Executive Order on Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the federal government</a>&nbsp;(“Equity EO”) launched a whole-of-government effort to incorporate the principle of equity throughout the federal government. Recognizing that the ability to conduct&nbsp;equity assessments—i.e., to understand the impact of federal policies on equity outcomes—and identify and remove barriers to equitable access to government programs is contingent on gathering the necessary data, President Biden ordered the formation of the Equitable Data Working Group (“Working Group”). The President directed the Working Group to study existing federal data collection policies, programs, and infrastructure to identify inadequacies and provide recommendations that lay out a strategy for increasing data available for measuring equity and representing the diversity of the American people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Working Group, chaired by Dr. Alondra Nelson (Office of Science and Technology Policy) and Dr. Margo Schwab (Office of Management and Budget), consulted&nbsp;with a range of advocates and experts from civil society, including academic researchers and community leaders who leverage federal data,&nbsp;&nbsp;federal department and agency leads for data, statistics, privacy, and program evaluations, and our colleagues leading related equity efforts (e.g., the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/03/08/executive-order-on-establishment-of-the-white-house-gender-policy-council/">White House Gender Policy Council</a>,<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/01/27/fact-sheet-president-biden-takes-executive-actions-to-tackle-the-climate-crisis-at-home-and-abroad-create-jobs-and-restore-scientific-integrity-across-federal-government/">&nbsp;Justice40</a>,&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/whiaanhpi/index.html">White House Initiative on Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islanders</a>&nbsp;(WHIAANHPI)). The Working Group was also informed by agency efforts to implement the President’s policies on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/27/memorandum-on-restoring-trust-in-government-through-scientific-integrity-and-evidence-based-policymaking/">scientific integrity and evidence-based policymaking</a>, and related&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/nstc/scientific-integrity-task-force/">OSTP</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bing.com/newtabredir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.whitehouse.gov%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2021%2F06%2FM-21-27.pdf">OMB</a>&nbsp;guidance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These stakeholders and officials identified three priority uses for equitable data:&nbsp;<strong>generating disaggregated</strong>&nbsp;<strong>statistical estimates to characterize experiences</strong>&nbsp;of historically underserved groups using survey data;&nbsp;<strong>increasing non-federal research and community access to disaggregated data</strong>&nbsp;for the evidence-building that supports equity efforts; and&nbsp;<strong>conducting robust equity</strong><strong>&nbsp;assessments of federal programs&nbsp;</strong>to identify areas for improvement. The Working Group also pursued a series of case studies to identify what progress could be made using existing program data to answer equity-centered questions in areas such as economic recovery and pandemic or environmental disaster response.</p>



<p><strong>A Vision for Equitable Data</strong></p>



<p><a>Equitable data are those that allow for rigorous assessment of the extent to which government programs and policies yield consistently fair, just, and impartial treatment of all individuals. Equitable data&nbsp;illuminate opportunities for targeted actions that will result in demonstrably&nbsp;improved outcomes for underserved communities.&nbsp;</a>The following practices will allow us to&nbsp;<strong>achieve our equitable data vision:</strong></p>



<p><strong><em>Make Disaggregated Data the Norm While Protecting Privacy&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></strong></p>



<p><a></a><a>To ensure that historically underserved populations are empowered by and benefit from federal data, surveys, and equity assessments, the federal data system should support disaggregation, directly or through statistical estimates. However, a</a>s the federal government expands its use of disaggregated demographic data, it must be intentional about when data are collected and shared, as well as how data are protected so as not to exacerbate the vulnerability of members of underserved communities, many of whom face the heightened risk of harm if their privacy is not protected.<a></a></p>



<p><strong><em>Catalyze Existing Federal Infrastructure to Leverage Underused Data</em></strong></p>



<p>Although many federal programs do not report disaggregated data, they may partner with the thirteen&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/information-regulatory-affairs/statistical-programs-standards/">federal statistical agencies</a><a></a>&nbsp;(agencies whose principal mission is to produce official federal statistics) that have the experience, and many of the tools necessary, to allow departments and agencies to generate disaggregated estimates of program participation in ways that protect against inadvertent disclosure of identifiable information. Policy support for generating the legal and logistical agreements necessary for productive interagency data-sharing partnerships will help to avoid historical roadblocks and address underutilization of existing federal data by facilitating quick and safe access to disaggregated data for equity assessment. Data sharing must be done in a manner that explicitly addresses the tension between the public’s trust in data confidentiality and increasing data access for equity efforts.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>Build Capacity for Robust Equity Assessment for Policymaking and Program Implementation&nbsp;</em></strong></p>



<p>Equitable policymaking and program implementation require an approach to evaluation and data analysis that allows for robust assessment of compounded experiences and overlapping identities. Such analysis is critical because it recognizes how the interconnectedness of identities and experiences (e.g., as a Black woman, or as a transgender immigrant) shape the need for particular federal programs and services and the barriers that may prevent access. Agencies and program offices will need to invest in the statistical, evaluation, and data science expertise necessary to design and conduct robust equity assessments using their administrative data, consistent with the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/4174/text">Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act of 2018 (&#8220;Evidence Act</a>”)&nbsp;and the Equity EO.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>Galvanize Diverse Partnerships Across Levels of Government and the Research Community</em></strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Durable equitable data infrastructure requires fostering collaborations across all levels of government, as well as with a diverse community of external organizations in order to address specific challenges of mutual priority and interest. It will be necessary to create incentives and pathways for increased representation among research community participants interested in generating equitable data and to engage representatives of the communities that access and participate in federal programs in the design of research collaborations about those programs. Agencies must also look for opportunities to create mutually beneficial uses of the data that they request from grantees, in order to encourage providing good quality data.</p>



<p><strong><em>Be Accountable to the American Public&nbsp;</em></strong></p>



<p>Providing tools that allow civil society organizations and communities to use and visualize federal data and chart government’s progress toward equitable outcomes is crucial for strengthening accountability and credibility with the American public. Such tools encourage community participation in government equity efforts, but must meet individuals where they are in terms of data analysis capacity and resources. The government should support platforms and partnerships that enable the public to easily find meaningful data about the well-being of their communities and the services provided to them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>On April 22, a high-level U.S. delegation – led by National Security Council Indo-Pacific Coordinator Kurt Campbell, Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Daniel Kritenbrink, Deputy Commander INDOPACOM&nbsp;Lieutenant General&nbsp;Stephen Sklenka , and USAID Acting Senior Deputy Assistant Administrator for Asia Craig Hart – visited Honiara, Solomon Islands. The delegation met for ninety minutes with Prime Minister&nbsp;Manasseh&nbsp;Sogavare, along with two dozen members of his cabinet and senior staff. While there, the delegation also met with prominent religious leaders on the island and with key members of the political opposition.</p>



<p>This visit to&nbsp;Solomon Islands was the final leg of the delegation’s trip across the Pacific. It followed stops in Hawaii, where the delegation met with senior officials from Australia,&nbsp;Japan,&nbsp;and New Zealand; Fiji, where they met with Prime Minister&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;Bainimarama, as well as&nbsp;leadership of the Pacific Island Forum, and held the&nbsp;U.S.-Fiji Strategic Dialogue; and Papua New Guinea, where they met with Prime Minister James Marape and senior defense officials to discuss ways to enhance security ties. Across these engagements, the United States reiterated that it will seek to further deepen our enduring ties with&nbsp;the Pacific Islands&nbsp;and take tangible&nbsp;steps to advance a free, open, and resilient Indo-Pacific. The United States will do so by fulfilling and strengthening its commitments in the region, working to advance regional unity, coordinating with allies and partners on meeting twenty-first century challenges, and protecting the sovereignty of Pacific Island states.</p>



<p>In the meeting with Solomon Islands’ Prime Minister Sogavare, the delegation reiterated the key priorities animating the trip and also outlined specific steps&nbsp;the United States&nbsp;would take to advance the welfare of the people of&nbsp;Solomon Islands. The United States will expedite the opening of an embassy in&nbsp;Solomon Islands; advance cooperation on unexploded ordinance; launch a program on maritime domain awareness; dispatch the Mercy hospital ship to address public health; advance a dialogue on the return of the Peace Corps; deliver additional vaccines;&nbsp;and advance initiatives on&nbsp;climate, health,&nbsp;and people-to-people ties.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The United States respects the right of nations to make sovereign decisions in the best interests of their people. The two sides engaged in substantial discussion around the recently&nbsp;signed&nbsp;security agreement between&nbsp;Solomon Islands and the People’s Republic of China (PRC). Solomon Islands representatives indicated that the agreement had solely domestic applications, but the&nbsp;U.S. delegation noted&nbsp;there are potential regional security implications of the accord, including for the United States and its allies and partners. The U.S. delegation outlined clear areas of concern with respect to the purpose, scope, and transparency of the agreement.</p>



<p>If steps are taken to establish a de facto permanent military presence, power-projection capabilities, or a military installation, the delegation noted that the United States would then have significant concerns and respond accordingly. In response to these enumerated concerns, Prime Minister Sogavare reiterated his specific assurances that there would be no military base, no long-term presence, and no power projection capability, as he has said publicly. The United States emphasized that it will follow developments closely in consultation with regional partners.</p>



<p>At this critical juncture, the United States and Solomon Islands agreed to launch a high-level strategic dialogue, co-chaired on the U.S. side by the White House and the Department of State. Its purpose will be to enhance communication, address mutual concerns, and drive practical progress. In particular, both sides agreed to discuss in greater detail security issues of mutual concern, economic and social development, public health, and finance and debt. Each side committed to take the necessary steps in the intervening period to prepare for a successful engagement.</p>
