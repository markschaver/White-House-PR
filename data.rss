										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>1.&nbsp; On January 11, 2018, the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) transmitted to the President a report on the Secretary&#8217;s investigation into the effect of imports of steel mill articles (steel articles) on the national security of the United States under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1862). &nbsp;The Secretary found and advised the President of his opinion that steel articles are being imported into the United States in such quantities and under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the United States.</p>



<p>2.&nbsp; In Proclamation 9705 of March 8, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Steel Into the United States), the President concurred in the Secretary&#8217;s finding that steel articles, as defined in clause 1 of Proclamation 9705, as amended by clause 8 of Proclamation 9711 of March 22, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Steel Into the United States), are being imported into the United States in such quantities and under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the United States, and decided to adjust the imports of those steel articles by imposing a 25 percent ad valorem tariff on such articles imported from all countries except Canada and Mexico. &nbsp;The proclamation further stated that any country with which we have a security relationship is welcome to discuss with the United States alternative ways to address the threatened impairment of the national security caused by imports from that country, and noted that, should the United States and any such country arrive at a satisfactory alternative means to address the threat to the national security such that the President determines that imports from that country no longer threaten to impair the national security, the President may remove or modify the restriction on steel articles imports from that country and, if necessary, adjust the tariff as it applies to other countries, as the national security interests of the United&nbsp;States require.</p>



<p>3.&nbsp; The United States and Ukraine have developed a close security relationship.&nbsp; Ukraine has expressed its willingness to work with the United States to address the global excess capacity for producing steel. &nbsp;Ukraine&#8217;s steel industry has been significantly disrupted by the Russian Federation&#8217;s unjustified, unprovoked, unyielding, and unconscionable war against Ukraine. &nbsp;The significant disruption in Ukraine&#8217;s steel production is expected to decrease the total amount of steel produced by Ukraine as well as the amount of steel imported into the United&nbsp;States from Ukraine, which in 2021 accounted for less than 1 percent of all steel imports into the United States.&nbsp; At the same time, the steel industry has been historically important to Ukraine, and both the United States and Ukraine have an interest in maintaining that industry as an economic lifeline while the country recovers.</p>



<p>4.&nbsp; The United States and Ukraine have recently engaged in broad security discussions.&nbsp; The current disruption of Ukrainian steel production has been part of those discussions, and the ongoing discussion is anticipated to include alternative measures to prevent imports of steel from Ukraine from threatening the national security of the United States as Ukraine&#8217;s steel production recovers from the significant disruption caused by the war.</p>



<p>5.&nbsp; In light of the ongoing security discussions and significant disruption of Ukraine&#8217;s ability to produce steel, I conclude that Ukraine&#8217;s present situation presents a special case.&nbsp; I have determined to suspend the tariffs set forth in Proclamation 9705 for the import of steel articles and derivative steel articles from Ukraine for 1 year.&nbsp; The Secretary shall monitor the situation in the domestic steel industry and developments in Ukraine&#8217;s steel industry and inform me of any need to terminate or extend this suspension.</p>



<p><a>6.&nbsp; </a>In light of my determination to adjust the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9705 as applied to eligible steel articles and derivative steel articles that are the product of Ukraine, I have considered whether it is necessary and appropriate in light of our national security interests to make any corresponding adjustments to such tariff as it applies to products of other countries.&nbsp; I have determined that it is necessary and appropriate, at this time, to maintain the current tariff level as it applies to products of other countries.</p>



<p>7.&nbsp; Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, authorizes the President to take action to adjust the imports of an article and its derivatives that are being imported into the United States in such quantities or under such circumstances as&nbsp;to threaten to impair the national security.</p>



<p>8.&nbsp; Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19&nbsp;U.S.C. 2483), authorizes the President to embody in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) the substance of statutes affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction.</p>



<p>Now, Therefore, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United&nbsp;States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section&nbsp;232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, section 301 of title 3, United States Code, and section&nbsp;604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, do hereby proclaim as follows:</p>



<p>(1)&nbsp; Clause 2 of Proclamation 9705, as amended, is revised to read as follows:&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;(2)(a) &nbsp;In order to establish certain modifications to the duty rate on imports of steel articles, subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTSUS is modified as provided in the Annex to this proclamation and any subsequent proclamations regarding such steel articles.</p>



<p>(b) &nbsp;Except as otherwise provided in this proclamation, or in notices published pursuant to clause 3 of this proclamation, all steel articles imports covered by heading 9903.80.01, in subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTSUS, shall be subject to an additional 25 percent ad valorem rate of duty with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, as follows: &nbsp;(i) on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on March 23, 2018, from all countries except Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, South Korea, and the member countries of the European Union; (ii) on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on June 1, 2018, from all countries except Argentina, Australia, Brazil, and South Korea; (iii) on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on August 13, 2018, from all countries except Argentina, Australia, Brazil, South Korea, and Turkey; (iv) on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on May 20, 2019, from all countries except Argentina, Australia, Brazil, South Korea, and Turkey; (v) on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on May 21, 2019, from all countries except Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, and South Korea; (vi) on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern standard time on January 1, 2022, from all countries except Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, and South Korea, and except the member countries of the European Union through 11:59 p.m. eastern standard time on December 31, 2023, for steel articles covered by headings 9903.80.65 through 9903.81.19, inclusive; (vii) on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on April 1, 2022, from all countries except Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, and South Korea, and except the member countries of the European Union through 11:59 p.m. eastern standard time on December 31, 2023, for steel articles covered by headings 9903.80.65 through 9903.81.19, inclusive, and from Japan, for steel articles covered by headings 9903.81.25 through 9903.81.80, inclusive; and (viii) on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on June 1, 2022, from all countries except Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, South Korea, and except from Ukraine through 11:59 p.m. eastern daylight time on June 1, 2023, and except the member countries of the European Union through 11:59 p.m. eastern standard time on December 31, 2023, for steel articles covered by headings 9903.80.65 through 9903.81.19, inclusive, and from Japan through 11:59 p.m. eastern standard time on December 31, 2023, for steel articles covered by headings 9903.81.25 through 9903.81.80, inclusive. &nbsp;Further, except as otherwise provided in notices published pursuant to clause 3 of this proclamation, all steel articles imports from Turkey covered by heading 9903.80.02, in subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTSUS, shall be subject to a 50 percent ad&nbsp;valorem rate of duty with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on August 13, 2018, and prior to 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on May 21, 2019. &nbsp;All steel articles imports covered by heading 9903.80.61, in subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTSUS, shall be subject to the additional 25 percent ad valorem rate of duty established herein with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern time on the date specified in a determination by the Secretary granting relief. &nbsp;These rates of duty, which are in addition to any other duties, fees, exactions, and charges applicable to such imported steel articles, shall apply to imports of steel articles from each country as specified in the preceding three sentences.&#8221;</p>



<p>(2)  The first two sentences of clause 1 of Proclamation 9980 of January 24, 2020 (Adjusting Imports of Derivative Aluminum Articles and Derivative Steel Articles Into the United States), are revised to read as follows:</p>



<p>&#8220;In order to establish increases in the duty rate on imports of certain derivative articles, subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTSUS is modified as provided in Annex I and Annex II to this proclamation. &nbsp;Except as otherwise provided in this proclamation, all imports of derivative aluminum articles specified in Annex I to this proclamation shall be subject to an additional 10 percent ad valorem rate of duty, and all imports of derivative steel articles specified in Annex II to this proclamation shall be subject to an additional 25 percent ad&nbsp;valorem rate of duty, with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, as follows: &nbsp;(i) on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern standard time on February 8, 2020, these rates of duty, which are in addition to any other duties, fees, exactions, and charges applicable to such imported derivative aluminum articles or steel articles, shall apply to imports of derivative aluminum articles described in Annex I to this proclamation from all countries except Argentina, <a>the Commonwealth of Australia (Australia)</a>, Canada, and the United Mexican States (Mexico) and to imports of derivative steel articles described in Annex II to this proclamation from all countries except Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, and South Korea; (ii) on or after 12:01&nbsp;a.m. eastern standard time on January 1, 2022, these rates of duty, which are in addition to any other duties, fees, exactions, and charges applicable to such imported derivative aluminum articles or steel articles, shall apply to imports of derivative aluminum articles described in Annex I to this proclamation from all countries except Argentina, Australia, Canada, the member countries of the European Union, and Mexico and to imports of derivative steel articles described in Annex&nbsp;II to this proclamation from all countries except Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, the member countries of the European Union, Mexico, and South Korea; (iii) on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on April 1, 2022, these rates of duty, which are in addition to any other duties, fees, exactions, and charges applicable to such imported derivative aluminum articles or steel articles, shall apply to imports of derivative aluminum articles described in Annex I to this proclamation from all countries except Argentina, Australia, Canada, the member countries of the European Union, and Mexico and to imports of derivative steel articles described in Annex&nbsp;II to this proclamation from all countries except Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, the member countries of the European Union, Japan, Mexico, and South Korea; and (iv) on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on June 1, 2022, these rates of duty, which are in addition to any other duties, fees, exactions, and charges applicable to such imported derivative aluminum articles or steel articles, shall apply to imports of derivative aluminum articles described in Annex I to this proclamation from all countries except Argentina, Australia, Canada, the member countries of the European Union, and Mexico, and to imports of derivative steel articles described in Annex&nbsp;II to this proclamation from all countries except Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, the member countries of the European Union, Japan, Mexico, and South Korea, and except from Ukraine through 11:59 p.m. eastern daylight time on June 1, 2023.&#8221; &nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this</p>

<p>Yesterday, the White House commemorated National Foster Care Month with a roundtable highlighting seven young people with lived experience in the child welfare system. The meeting was convened by Assistant Secretary of the Administration for Children and Families January Contreras, White House American Rescue Plan Coordinator Gene Sperling, White House Office of Management and Budget Associate Director for Education, Income Maintenance and Labor Sherry Lachman, Deputy Assistant to the President for Racial Justice and Equity Chiraag Bains, Deputy Assistant to the President for Economic Mobility Carmel Martin, and Domestic Policy Advisor to Vice President Harris Rohini Kosoglu. The participants came to the White House from Florida, Kentucky, Maine, New Jersey, New York, Virginia, and Washington, D.C.</p>



<p>Participants discussed the importance of increased mental health services and trauma support for children in the child welfare system, the importance of kinship care, sibling connections, peer mentorship, and culturally competent placement, the need for continued resources for foster youth as they transition out of care, and the link between the child welfare system and the criminal justice system. Participants noted the disproportionate impact of the child welfare system on children of color, especially Black and Native youth, and on LGBTQI+ youth.</p>



<p>Administration officials highlighted the President and Vice President’s commitment to child welfare reforms, including the $10 billion increase in funding proposed in the President’s fiscal year 2023 Budget, which includes investments to support prevention and kinship care, expand support for youth aging out of foster care, and reduce reliance on congregate care. Administration officials also highlighted the President’s whole-of-government commitment to equity, strategy to address the national mental health crisis, and resources available to foster youth and transition-aged youth through the American Rescue Plan.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>10:37 A.M. EDT</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT: &nbsp;Hello, Naval Academy!&nbsp; Whoa.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before I begin my speech, a thought crossed my mind as I was told the Class of ‘72 is here.&nbsp; I was appointed to the Academy in 1965 by a senator who I was running against in 1972.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Never planned it that way.&nbsp; I wasn&#8217;t old enough to be sworn in.&nbsp; I was only 29 years old when I was running. &nbsp;He was a fine man, and his name was J. Caleb Boggs.</p>



<p>I didn&#8217;t come to the Academy because I wanted to be a football star.&nbsp; And you had a guy named Staubach and Bellino here.&nbsp; So I went to Delaware.</p>



<p>But all kidding aside, the best line of the debate was &#8212; after it was all over, the announcer &#8212; the questioner who was a good guy but supported my opponent &#8212; who was a good man as well, I might add &#8212; and he said, “Senator Boggs, you have anything else you want to say?”&nbsp; And he said, “Yes, just one thing.”&nbsp; And he took the microphone.&nbsp; He said, “You know, Joe, if you had accepted my commission to the Aca- &#8212; my appointment to the Academy,” he said, “you&#8217;d still have one year and three months active duty, and I&#8217;d have no problems right now.”&nbsp; (Laughter.)</p>



<p>So, the Class of ’72 &#8212; (laughs) &#8212; welcome.&nbsp; You guys must be very proud of all you&#8217;ve seen and done.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Well, midshipmen, you made it!&nbsp; You made it!&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>I’ll bet there were times you wondered if you’d ever see this day &#8212; (laughter) &#8212; especially in those early days when you had to chop everywhere, memorize every Reef Point to make it through the Sea Trials, so &#8212; and even &#8212; even passing chemistry, for God’s sake.&nbsp; (Laughs.)</p>



<p>Well, this education has at times pushed the edge of what you thought would be possible in order to develop you morally, mentally, and physically.</p>



<p>And it was worth it.&nbsp; It was worth it all because today you stand ready to assume the title you’ve been working toward for so long: Ensign, the United States Navy.&nbsp; Second lieutenant, the United States Marine Corps.</p>



<p>Members of the greatest fighting force in the history of the world.&nbsp; And that’s no exaggeration.&nbsp; You have earned it.&nbsp; Congratulations.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>I mean it &#8212; you really are.&nbsp; I’ve been in and out of Iraq and Afghanistan over 40 &#8212; I think 38 times.&nbsp; My son spent a year in Iraq, won the Bronze Star, Conspicuous Service Medal.&nbsp; I lost him.</p>



<p>But any rate, I’ve seen you in action.&nbsp; This is the finest military &#8212; not a joke.&nbsp; We have the finest military in the history of the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And thank you, Admiral &#8212; Admiral Buck, for the work you and your team have done to put these young men and women in shape, when they arrived here four <s>days</s> [years] ago on I-Day, into officers of the Armed Services of the United States of America.</p>



<p>And, Secretary Del Toro, Admiral Gilday, General Berger, you know better than anyone how important this &#8212; these missions are that we’re going to ask these young officers to carry out.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And looking out at this field, it’s clear to me we’re going to be sending our finest.</p>



<p>Congressman Ruppersberger, it’s great to see you here.&nbsp; I’m told you’re here.</p>



<p>I also want to recognize Congressman DesJarlais and &#8212; who &#8212; and Congressman Crowley, both here today as proud parents of commissioning midshipmen.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>And, by the way &#8212; and I know &#8212; you know that all midshipmen here are holding in their hearts the memory of two classmates who tragically did not live to see this day.&nbsp; I hope I’m pronouncing Duke’s last correctly &#8212; Carillo.&nbsp; And Michael &#8212; and Michael Myles James.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Folks &#8212; midshipmen, this is your day.&nbsp; But I want to start by recognizing the people who got you here: your parents, your family &#8212; everyone here that shows their support to get you here, it’s their day as well.</p>



<p>So, midshipmen, stand up and clap for them.&nbsp; For them!&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; I mean it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, moms and dads and grandparents, thanks for instilling such honor and integrity in these young women and men.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>Class of 2022, you’ve made incredible memories &#8212; please, have a seat &#8212; during your time in the Yard.</p>



<p>After all this &#8212; after all this, the class holds one of the fastest Herndon Climbs in history &#8212; (applause) &#8212; upholding a tradition set by the “link in the chain” &#8212; class chain &#8212; 50 years ago.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is a class that earned a record number of wins against the Army in the “N-Star” Competition.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>I hope my son up in heaven doesn’t hear me saying that part.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; He’s Army.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>So many wins, you ran out of room on that flagpole, man.&nbsp; (Laughs.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Look, this is a class of Midshipman Diego Fagot, who wasn’t expecting that snap in this year’s Army-Navy Game.&nbsp; But once he got the ball, he knew what the hell to do with it, didn’t he?&nbsp; You won the game.&nbsp; You won the game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The class of Midshipman Sarah Skinner, the 54th Rhodes Scholar from the United States Naval Academy &#8212; (applause) &#8212; 54th &#8212; and led the Women’s Rugby team to a national title.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Stand up.&nbsp; I want you standing up.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; And now Sarah is on the Olympic Development team.&nbsp; I can’t wait to see you, kid.&nbsp; I can’t wait to see you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When I couldn’t play football anymore, I played rugby in law school.&nbsp; I should’ve spent more time in law school.&nbsp; (Laughter.)</p>



<p>But at any rate, class of Midshipman, First Class, Andre Rascoe, Delta Company &#8212; your class president.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; I don’t know, but somebody told me you may have questions for me.&nbsp; (Laughter.)</p>



<p>I think only the class understands that one.</p>



<p>You’ve all got so much to be proud of.&nbsp; You really do.&nbsp; (Laughter.)</p>



<p>And, by the way, once you’re commissioned, remember: I’m your Commander-in-Chief.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; So don’t ask me too tough a question, okay?</p>



<p>Look &#8212; and I know, unlike me, when I graduated from the University of Delaware &#8212;</p>



<p>AUDIENCE MEMBER:&nbsp; Wooo!</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; &#8212; I had a few &#8212; thank you &#8212; I had a few minor infractions, like hosing down an RA in a &#8212; anyway.&nbsp; (Laughter.)</p>



<p>Unfortunately, this &#8212; we didn’t have the same tradition you have here.&nbsp; So, before I take care of you, let’s not forget: This is also the class that also got rowdy during the Air Force week in plebe year, and they’re still trying to clean the chocolate syrup off the ceiling in King Hall.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>You lived through “Red Beach Massacre.”&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; And that helped &#8212; and that helped the printers “earn their jump wings.”&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; If anyone wants to fess up to getting a printer onto the Chapel Dome, now’s your moment.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; No one is going to admit it, huh?&nbsp; Okay.</p>



<p>Because as your Commander-in-Chief, in keeping with longstanding tradition, I hereby absolve all those serving restrictions for minor infractions.&nbsp; You are absolved.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I &#8212; as I said, I wished all my graduation speakers would’ve been able to do that.&nbsp; (Laughs.)&nbsp; You all think I’m kidding; I’m not.&nbsp; (Laughter.)</p>



<p>Midshipmen, above all, the Academy has trained you to be leaders.&nbsp; Easy word to throw around, but hard to accomplish.&nbsp; You didn’t take the easier route when you chose the Academy and, again, when you signed your Two for Sevens.</p>



<p>You chose a life of service and purpose.&nbsp; You chose trial and sacrifice.&nbsp; You chose to be part of a mission that is greater than any individual.</p>



<p>While every class of midshipmen is tested, you faced added challenges to maintain a sense of mission and community and purpose when the global pandemic forced everything &#8212; literally everything &#8212; to change.</p>



<p>When you were told not to return after spring break as “youngsters.”</p>



<p>When in your second year you weren’t allowed to see any other &#8212; anybody other than your roommate.&nbsp; Hope to hell you picked right.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>And when you had to take your classes over Joom [sic] &#8212; Zoom, I should say, sitting in your uniforms and mesh shorts.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Oh, I figured that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And then coming back to the Yard as Firsties not only to reform, but to remember what this place and what this time is supposed to be like; to return to the brigade to what it was pre-COVID and rebuild morale.</p>



<p>You had the responsibility to right the ship.&nbsp; And all of you stepped up, I’m told.&nbsp; You came together.&nbsp; You learned the first and most important lesson of leadership: to always, always care for your people, to respect everyone’s talents, to be inclusive, and to make sure that the United States Navy and the United States Marine Corps draw from the full strength and diversity of this nation.&nbsp; Everybody.</p>



<p>Midshipmen, for the rest of your careers, you’re going to face challenges unforeseen.</p>



<p>You’re going to have to adapt and be ready to lead your people through whatever lies ahead.&nbsp; To state the obvious: No generation of graduates gets to pick what world they’re going live &#8212; they’re going to graduate into.&nbsp; It’s already been formed for you.&nbsp; But you must change it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>No officer knows the range of challenges they’ll face when they commission.</p>



<p>And, Class of 2022, you are graduating at an inflection point not only in American history but in world history.&nbsp; And I mean it.&nbsp; The challenge we face and the choices we make are more consequential than ever.</p>



<p>Things are changing so rapidly that the next 10 years will be the decisive decade of this century, because they’re going to shape what our world looks like and the values that will guide it not just for the immediate future, but for generations to come.&nbsp; And that is not hyperbole.</p>



<p>Over the past few years, we’ve seen how interconnected the world is.&nbsp; The deadly pandemic has impacted not just our own schooling, but almost every aspect of our lives &#8212; impacts of disruptions to the global supply chain causing significant inflation; accelerating the climate crisis that’s leading to rising seas and more severe weather patterns arou- &#8212; around the globe.</p>



<p>And Putin’s brutal, brutal war in Ukraine: Not only is he trying to take over Ukraine, he’s literally trying to wipe out the culture and identity of the Ukrainian people, attacking schools, nurseries, hospitals, museums with no other purpose than to eliminate a culture.&nbsp; A direct assault on the fundamental tenets of rule-based international order.</p>



<p>That’s what you’re graduating into.&nbsp; That’s the world in which ensigns and second lieutenants &#8212; a world that more than ever requires strong, principled, engaged American leadership; where America leads not only by the example of its power, but the power of its example.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Think of why most nations agreed to support us.&nbsp; It’s the example &#8212; it’s the example we set.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>And you’ll learn to crew the most advanced ships in the world, train the most elite combat units, conduct undetected submarine missions, fly the most advanced fighter planes.</p>



<p>But the most powerful tool that you’ll wield is our unmatched network of global alliances and the strength of our partnerships &#8212; which, since I got elected, I’ve been trying to re-establish in detail.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Earlier this week, I returned from my first trip as President &#8212; been there before &#8212; as President though &#8212; to the Indo-Pacific, a region that will be vital to the future of our world.</p>



<p>I met with the leaders of Japan &#8212; the heads of state of Japan, the Republic of Korea.&nbsp; I participated in a meeting of the Quad, which I restarted over China’s objection &#8212; including Australia, Japan, India, and the United States &#8212; four leading democracies in the Indo-Pacific.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I launched, together with 13 other countries across the region, the new Indo-Pacific Economic Framework to help write the rules of the road for the 21st century.</p>



<p>Before I departed Asia &#8212; before I left for Asia, I should say, I got a phone call from the Prime Minister of Sweden and the President of Finland &#8212; could they come and see me in the Oval.&nbsp; They came to ask me whether I would support them joining NATO.&nbsp; The actions taken by Putin were an attempt to &#8212; to use my phrase &#8212; to “Findalize” all of Europe &#8212; make it all neutral.&nbsp; Instead, he “NATOized” all of Europe.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>And all of this is illustrative of a foreign policy that is built around the power of working together with Allies and partners to amplify our strength, to solve problems, to project our power beyond what we can do alone, and to preserve stability in an uncertain world.</p>



<p>This is the work that will be asked of you.&nbsp; This is not hyperbole.&nbsp; I’m being deadly earnest with you, because it will be.</p>



<p>As sailors and Marines, submariners and SEALs, Navy aviators and surface warfare officers, we’re going to look to you to ensure the security of the American people, to build connections and strengthen interoperability of &#8212; with our allies and partners around the world.</p>



<p>You’ve already started that work here at the Academy, where today we are graduating 12 international midshipmen, representing 10 countries, who will commission as officers in the militaries of their nations.</p>



<p>Graduates, you will be the symbol and the strength of your commitment to lead the world.</p>



<p>You’re going to stand sentinel, often shoulder-to-shoulder, with our allies and partners in critical regions of the world &#8212; like the service women and men I just visited in the Republic of Korea or the troops I spent time with in Poland in March who are making real our commitment to the security of our NATO Allies.</p>



<p>In the Indo-Pacific, a maritime theater, [you] will be the leading edge of our response to natural or humanitarian disasters, showing people throughout the region the unmatched ability of the United States to be a force for good.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You’ll defend the international rules of the road and underwrite the future for the Indo-Pacific that is free and open, ensure freedom of navigation of the South China Sea and beyond, and make sure the sea lanes remain open and secure.</p>



<p>These longstanding, basic maritime principles are the bedrock of a global economy and global stability.&nbsp; And you&#8217;re going to help knit together our allies in Europe with our allies in the Indo-Pacific.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For the first time &#8212; if I can hesitate for a second here &#8212; did anybody think, when I called for sanctions against Russia, that in addition to NATO, that Australia, Japan, <s>North</s> [South] Korea, some of the ASEAN countries, would stand up and support those sanctions?&nbsp; The world is moving so rapidly.&nbsp; I need not tell you aviators.&nbsp; Within the next decade, you&#8217;re going to be able to circumvent the world in &#8212; within the atmosphere in a little less than &#8212; a little more than an hour.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Things are changing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>And Putin’s brutal assault on Ukraine has spurred a truly global response not just from Europe, but from Japan, Korea, Singapore, New Zealand, and more &#8212; standing with us to impose sanctions on Russia.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Australia, sending military aid.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Germany, for the first time, significantly upping their budget.&nbsp; Germany.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fiji, assisting the FBI in seizing the yacht of an oligarch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’re seeing the world align not in terms of geography &#8212; East and West, Pacific and Atlantic &#8212; but in terms of values.</p>



<p>We’re living through a global struggle between autocracies and democracies.&nbsp; And I will note &#8212; and my co- &#8212; I&#8217;ve met more with Xi Jinping than any other world leader has.&nbsp; When he called me to congratulate me on election night, he said to me what he said many times before.&nbsp; He said, “Democracies cannot be sustained in the 21st century.&nbsp; Autocracies will run the world.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Things are changing so rapidly.&nbsp; Democracies require a consensus, and it takes time, and you don’t have the time.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>He&#8217;s wrong.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Each of you, as you go out into the world, will not only be a proud member of the Armed Forces of the United States of America, you’ll be representatives and defenders of our democracy.&nbsp; It sounds corny but, literally, our democracy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s why you swear an oath not to me as your Commander-in-Chief or to any political leader, but to the Constitution.</p>



<p>Our nation is placing in you great trust and great faith.&nbsp; A young we- &#8212; man with me today, carrying in town the football.&nbsp; All the responsibility given to so many of you, so consequential.&nbsp; Because you’ve chose &#8212; you’ve chosen the honorable path that few before you have done.</p>



<p>And you&#8217;re going to look to uphold the honor of this institution and the generation of proud patriots who’ve passed this way before you.&nbsp; Patriots like a dear friend of mine, John McCain.</p>



<p>John and I went after each other hammer and tong on the Senate floor.&nbsp; We disagreed politically on things.&nbsp; But being here, I can’t help think of John and how the Naval Academy meant so much to him.&nbsp; He chose these grounds for his final resting place.</p>



<p>John was an American hero who withstood torture, years of being held as a prisoner of war.&nbsp; And when he came home, he decided to continue &#8212; he wanted to continue to serve.&nbsp; We traveled tens of thousands of miles together as he &#8212; staffing me as a senator.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I&#8217;m one of the reasons &#8212; and I used to always get kidded by my Democratic friends &#8212; I talked him into running.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He was a man of great principle and capacity.&nbsp; He always lived by a code &#8212; the same code that you all have been taught.&nbsp; It’s not just words, it’s real: duty, honor, loyalty.</p>



<p>He kept that code throughout his years as a prisoner of war, all the time he served in the United States Congress.&nbsp; As I said, we often disagreed, but we were close friends.&nbsp; John and I, we knew one another.</p>



<p>In March of 2018, I was honored that John asked me &#8212; because he wasn’t physically able &#8212; to come to the Naval Academy and receive on his behalf the Alumni Association&#8217;s Distinguished Graduate Award and speak for him.</p>



<p>Shortly after that, when John was on his deathbed in his home in Arizona, I went to see him.</p>



<p>I was leaving, after the visit, and in a voice barely above a whisper, he called me over to his bedside.&nbsp; He said, “Joe, will you do my eulogy?”&nbsp; I said, “Yes, John.”&nbsp; And literally at the same time, two guys who think they&#8217;re hardass guys looked to one another and said, “I love you.”</p>



<p><br>Class of 2022, John McCain’s memorial was one of the first</p>



<p>experiences you had at the Academy back in 2018.</p>



<p>Your class motto, “Not all of me shall die,” I can’t help but think must be a reflection &#8212; some reflection of that moment in your lives, a reminder of the responsibilities you have taken on and the legacy you will leave behind.</p>



<p>It’s a promise &#8212; a promise you made to each other and to this institution, because what lives on will be the service you will give to others and the timeless principles that you’re willing to sacrifice everything to defend.</p>



<p>In this moment, we must steer our nation and our world through this decisive decade.&nbsp; I hope you’ll keep the memory of the example of Academy graduates, like my friend John McCain, close in your hearts as you embark on your commissions.</p>



<p>I cannot promise you the way will be straight or the sailing will be easy, but I can promise you that you all have the tools needed to navigate any waters you encounter.</p>



<p>This great academy has prepared you to face every challenge and overcome any obstacle.&nbsp; You are ready.</p>



<p>For my wish to you is fair winds and following seas, because I know you will remain always faithful.</p>



<p>May God protect you all and may He set you on your journey.&nbsp; And may God protect all those who wear the uniform of the United States of America.</p>



<p>Thank you.&nbsp; Thank you for your service.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>

<p>On Memorial Day, we remember the patriots who gave their lives in the service of America, in the service of freedom, and in the service of justice.  They made the ultimate sacrifice to defend our Constitution and our democracy.  We are free because they were brave, and we live by the light of the flame of liberty they kept burning.  They are all heroes, and our Nation is forever grateful.<br><br>Those who wear the uniform of the United States Armed Forces know the pride of service and what it means to dedicate themselves to a cause greater than themselves.  These women and men put their lives on the line for an idea &#8212; the idea of America. They are the best of us.  On this day, as we honor the fallen angels who consecrated this great Nation and the ideals that we stand for with their blood, we rededicate ourselves to the unending work of bringing our country ever closer to that more perfect Union for which they died.  <br><br>Today and every day, we ask God to protect our troops, to shine light perpetual upon the fallen, and to bring comfort to their families.  To those who mourn a loved one, and to America&#8217;s Gold Star Families who have lost a loved one in conflict, my heart aches for you.  Our Nation owes you and those you have lost a tremendous debt that we can never fully repay.  On Memorial Day, we vow to honor their memories and support the families, caregivers, and survivors they left behind. <br><br>As we honor the memories of our fallen heroes, we are grateful for the future they made possible for us and rededicate ourselves to seeking enduring peace.  Our heroes gave their lives for our country, and they live forever in our hearts &#8212; forever proud, forever honorable, and forever American.<br> <br>In honor and recognition of all of our fallen service members, the Congress, by a joint resolution approved May 11, 1950, as amended (36 U.S.C. 116), has requested that the President issue a proclamation calling on the people of the United States to observe each Memorial Day as a day of prayer for permanent peace and designating a period on that day when the people of the United States might unite in prayer and reflection.  The Congress, by Public Law 106-579, has also designated 3:00 p.m. local time on that day as a time for all Americans to observe, in their own way, the National Moment of Remembrance.<br><br>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim Memorial Day, May 30, 2022, as a day of prayer for permanent peace, and I designate the hour beginning in each locality at 11:00 a.m. of that day as a time when people might unite in prayer and reflection.  I urge the press, radio, television, and all other information media to cooperate in this observance.  I further ask all Americans to observe the National Moment of Remembrance beginning at 3:00 p.m. local time on Memorial Day.<br><br>I request the Governors of the United States and its Commonwealths and Territories, and the appropriate officials of all units of government, to direct that the flag be flown at half-staff until noon on this Memorial Day on all buildings, grounds, and naval vessels throughout the United States and in all areas under its jurisdiction and control.  I also request the people of the United States to display the flag at half-staff from their homes for the customary forenoon period.<br><br>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-seventh day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-sixth.<br> </p>

<p>This morning’s decline in inflation is a sign of progress, even as we have more work to do. The report showed annual inflation declining and average monthly core inflation at around 4% at an annual rate, down from around 6% in the three months before it. At the same time, inflation is still too high and Putin’s price hike continues to impact food and energy prices. There is more work to do and tackling inflation is my top economic priority. My plan is to give The Federal Reserve the independence it needs to do its job, lower families’ costs, and lower the federal deficit. Congressional Republicans have a different economic plan, which would increase taxes on working families and put programs like Social Security and Medicare on the chopping block every five years. That’s not the way forward to transition from what has been an historic economic recovery to stable, steady growth that works for working families.</p>

<p>President Biden welcomes Fiji’s decision to join the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF) as a founding member, the 14<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;nation and first in the Pacific Islands to do so. IPEF now reflects the full regional diversity of the Indo-Pacific, with members from Northeast and Southeast Asia, South Asia, Oceania, and the Pacific Islands. Across geography, we are united in our commitment to a free, open, and prosperous Indo-Pacific region. A close partner to the United States and a leader in the region, Fiji will add vital value and perspective to IPEF, including on our efforts to tackle the climate crisis and build a clean economy that creates good paying jobs. The future of the 21st century economy is going to be largely written in the Indo-Pacific, and IPEF will help to drive sustainable growth for all our economies. The United States thanks Prime Minister Bainimarama, and we look forward to deepening our partnership for the benefit of our countries, the Pacific Islands, and the Indo-Pacific.</p>

<p>4:10 P.M. EDT<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Hey, good afternoon, everybody.&nbsp; Okay, I have a few toppers, so please bear with me.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over the past 15 months, we’ve made tremendous progress in our fight against COVID, with 220 million Americans fully vaccinated and over 100 million people boosted.</p>



<p>We’ve also moved quickly to ensure Paxlovid, an oral antiviral pill that reduces risk of hospitalization and death by almost 90 percent, is widely available.<br><br>Importantly, because of all the work the Biden administration has done on vaccines, boosters, treatments, and more, daily COVID-19 deaths are down by 90 percent from when the President took office, even as infections are rising.<br><br>So the tools that the administration has made widely available to the American people are working to prevent serious illness, to keep people out of the hospital, and to save lives.<br><br>And while COVID isn’t over, it’s critical that Americans know that we now have more tools than ever to protect ourselves.&nbsp; We can now prevent most COVID deaths, and that’s ma- &#8212; that’s major progress.<br><br>To drive further progress, today we announced new federal &#8212; federally supported test-to-treat sites.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, the first of these launches in &#8212; launches in Providence, Rhode Island.&nbsp; In the coming days, we’ll deploy clinical personnel to help transform several of Minnesota’s state-run testing sites into test-to-treat sites.&nbsp; And in the coming weeks, we will work to open more in places like New York and Illinois.<br><br>These build on the more than 2,500 sites we’ve already set up at local pharmacies and community healthcare centers.<br><br>Yesterday afternoon, the Governor of Oklahoma signed into law the most extreme piece of legislation to undo a woman’s fundamental right to make her own reproductive choices since Roe became law.&nbsp; This law will go into effect immediately.<br><br>Not only does this law ban abortion from the moment of fertilization, but it also adopts Texas’s &#8212; Texas plan to allow private citizens to sue their neighbors for providing reproductive healthcare and helping women to exercise their constitutional rights.<br><br>This law is the latest in a growing effort by ultra-MAGA officials across the country to roll back freedoms that should not be taken for granted.&nbsp; Roe has been the law of the land for almost 50 years, and it is under serious threat.<br><br>They are starting with reproductive rights, but the attack on our fundamental rights, including the right to contraception and marriage equality, is growing.&nbsp; And these rights are increasingly at risk.<br><br>The President believes that women have the fundamental right to make their own reproductive health choices, and he and the Vice President and the entire administration are committing to protecting these constitutional rights and fundamental freedoms.<br><br>Today, the Department of Agriculture announced new steps to strengthen food supply chains, increase competition in the meat processing sector, and lower prices for American consumers.<br><br>The Department is making $200 million available to create a new processing capacity expansion program, providing $25 million for workforce training and releasing the first of three planned rules designed to bolster enforcement of the Packers and Stocks&#8212; Stockyards Act which will increase transparency.<br><br>These actions will combat &#8212; combat market dominance by a small number of major meat and poultry processors in key markets, where excessive concentration and control has led to lower prices paid to poultry producers and higher prices by consumers.<br><br>After the severe and sweeping sanctions on the Central Bank of Russia, the Department of Treasury issued General License 9 to provide for an orderly transition so that the bond holders could get paid.<br><br>We’ve announced that we will not be renewing the license.&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that the &#8212; this means that Russia will likely fail to meet its obligation and face default, an enduring sign of their status as a pariah in the global financial system.<br><br>We expect the impact of the U.S. and the global economy to be minimal given Russia has already been isolated financially.&nbsp;<br><br>That being said, Treasury Department continues to monitor and have conversations with the global financial community.<br><br>I have two scheduling updates.<br><br>Next week, the President will welcome Prime Minister of New Zealand to the White House &#8212; another example of our continued commitment to the Indo-Pacific.&nbsp; We’ll have more details on this as we get closer.<br><br>And as you all saw, we announced that on Sunday the President and the First Lady will travel to Uvalde to grieve with the community that lost 21 lives in the horrific elementary school shooting.<br><br>We &#8212; we’ll have more to share as we get closer, but while he’s there, the President will meet with the community leaders, religious leaders, and the families of the victim.<br><br>The President and First Lady believe it is important to show their support for the community during this devastating time and to be there for the families of the victims.<br><br>And lastly, on Tuesday, as you all know, the parents of 19 kids did what so many of us parents do every morning: They gave their kids a kiss, told them they loved them, and wished them a good day at school.&nbsp; They figured their kids would spend their day reading, writing, doing math; playing with friends at recess.&nbsp; These kids never came home.<br><br>Some of these parents needed to give DNA samples to be able to identify their own children.&nbsp;&nbsp;These were elementary school kids.&nbsp;&nbsp;They should be losing their first teeth, not losing their lives.&nbsp;&nbsp;They should be at little league, softball, and soccer practices this weekend.&nbsp;&nbsp;These parents should be planning their kid’s summer, not their child’s funeral.</p>



<p>As &#8212; as a parent, it is unfathomable to me that this happened.&nbsp;&nbsp;These kids had their whole lives in front of them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our hearts ache for their families.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our hearts ache for the family and loved ones of the teachers who were killed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Schools should be sanctuaries of learning, not battlefields.&nbsp;&nbsp;And teachers should be there to teach, nurture, prepa- &#8212; and prepare our children for the future, not to be gunned down or asked to sacrifice their own lives for the kids they love.&nbsp;&nbsp;But that is what two heroic teachers did in Uvalde &#8212; killed while trying to protect their students.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m a parent of an elementary school student.&nbsp;&nbsp;I know many of you in this room are as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot become numb to this.&nbsp;&nbsp;We will not accept this.&nbsp;&nbsp;A grocery store, a church, an elementary school.&nbsp;&nbsp;And this is just in the last few days.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is unacceptable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As the President said the other night, why are we willing to live with this carnage?&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do we keep letting this happen?&nbsp;&nbsp;Where in God&#8217;s name is our backbone?</p>



<p>So I ask, how is protecting our children a partisan issue?&nbsp;&nbsp;How is preventing innocent people from being slaughtered controversial?</p>



<p>Commonsense gun safety laws work.&nbsp;&nbsp;We know this.&nbsp;&nbsp;They save lives.</p>



<p>As the President said Tuesday night, when the assault weapons ban passed, shootings went down.&nbsp;&nbsp;They tripled after it was lifted.</p>



<p>And let&#8217;s be clear: The public supports this; they are behind this &#8212; even gun owners.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ninety percent of gun owners support universal background checks.&nbsp;&nbsp;Eighty-four percent of Republicans and eighty percent of NRA members support background checks.</p>



<p>As the President said this week, it is time to turn this pain into action.&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#8217;s time for Congress to act.</p>



<p>And with that, Darlene, I will take your question.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you.&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there any reaction here from &#8212; at the White House to the Senate Republicans blocking the domestic terrorism bill, which was supposed to open the door for some debate and discussion about gun safety, as you were just talking about?<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp;&nbsp;So we&#8217;re disappointed that Congress did not move forward with the legislation that would strengthen our response to domestic terror incidents like we saw in Buffalo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We need Congress to act on that.&nbsp;&nbsp;And we need Congress to advance commonsense measures that we know will save lives when it comes to gun violence.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And secondly, the NRA is opening its convention in Houston tomorrow, three days after the massacre in Uvalde.&nbsp;&nbsp;Former President Trump, Texas Governor Abbott, and others are set to speak there.&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the White House think it is appropriate for that convention to move forward?&nbsp;&nbsp;Should it be postponed, cancelled, given the events of the last few days?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp;&nbsp;So it&#8217;s not about the convention.&nbsp;&nbsp;What is inappropriate is that the leadership of the National Rifle Association has proven time and time again that they are contributing to the problem of gun violence, not trying to solve it.</p>



<p>They represent the interests of the gun industry, the gun manufacturers who are marketing weapons of war to young adults.&nbsp;&nbsp;They don&#8217;t represent gun owners who know that we need to take action.&nbsp;&nbsp;And it&#8217;s shameful that the NRA and their allies have stood in the way of every attempt to advance measures that will &#8212; that will &#8212; that we all know will save lives from gun violence, measures that we know would keep weapons off &#8212; of war out of the hands of people who are terrorizing our community.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So that is what matters, and it is shameful.<br><br>Go ahead, Nancy.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks, Karine.&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the President believe that there should be an investigation into the police response to this school shooting?<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp;&nbsp;So we&#8217;ve heard of &#8212; (member of the press coughs) &#8212; we&#8217;ve &#8212; need some water?&nbsp;&nbsp;You okay?&nbsp;&nbsp;(Laughs.)&nbsp;&nbsp;Just let us know.</p>



<p>The President &#8212; we&#8217;ve &#8212; we&#8217;ve been watching the reporting on this.&nbsp;&nbsp;The President has the utmost respect, as you all know, for the men and women of law enforcement.&nbsp;&nbsp;Just days ago, he honored the memory of the former police officer, Aaron Salter, in Buffalo who was killed bravely while trying to stop the shooter at the supermarket.</p>



<p>I know that right now authorities are working to piece together more details of what happened in Uvalde, so we won&#8217;t prejudge the results from here at this time.</p>



<p>It is al- &#8212; it is always a good idea to look back and try to find any lessons we can learn, especially from trag- &#8212; tragedies like this, so that we can prevent them from moving forward, including law enforcement response.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And is the President considering calling on Congress to stay in town to work on this issue instead of going home for a week-long recess?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; So we have been in close touch with Congress &#8212; even before this shooting and, clearly, what we saw in Buffalo &#8212; about gun reform.&nbsp; This is something that has been a priority from the Pre- &#8212; for the President since day one of his administration.&nbsp; And we also have been in close touch and we really appreciate what Senator Schumer and Speaker Pelosi have been doing.</p>



<p>You know, the President has been very clear that it&#8217;s time to act, it&#8217;s time for Congress to act.&nbsp; The President has long urged Congress to take action to fight gun violence, including by expanding background checks.&nbsp; He supports Leader Schumer&#8217;s plan to bring legislation forward.</p>



<p>They &#8212; the Congress would clearly handle the mechanics of all of this.&nbsp; And, you know, during &#8212; as you all may remember, during the State of the Union, the President asked Congress to pass proven measures to reduce gun violence, pass universal background checks.&nbsp; Why should anyone on &#8212; on the terrorist list be able to purchase a weapon?</p>



<p>Those were what &#8212; is what he said just a couple of months ago.&nbsp; So we have an opportunity to do that right now.&nbsp; And we encourage Congress to act.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, finally, the average age of suspects at school mass shootings is 18.&nbsp; Would the President support raising the age at which someone can buy a gun to 21?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; So the President was very clear about this just recently when he said that the &#8212; that &#8212; in his remarks, just on Tuesday, that it doesn&#8217;t make sense for an 18-year-old to legally buy an assault weapon.<br><br>And so, he made very clear on Tuesday when he &#8212; after he landed from Asia and had to deal with such a devastating news that happened in Texas.<br><br>Yeah, go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Karine.&nbsp; There was a bipartisan group of senators &#8212; nine senators &#8212; that met today.&nbsp; Does the White House have any confidence that this group could reach a meaningful agreement?&nbsp; And does the White House plan to get involved with those negotiations?&nbsp; Would the President bring that group down while they&#8217;re having these talks and meet with them?<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; So, I don&#8217;t have anything to preview for you as to any meetings &#8212; upcoming meetings that may be happening at the White House this week or next week or in the coming weeks.<br><br>We really, truly, as I said, leave it to &#8212; the mechanics up to Senator Schumer and Speaker Pelosi.&nbsp; We are confident in &#8212; in that they will &#8212; that Senator Schumer will bring this forward.<br><br>And again, it is time for Congress to act.&nbsp; This is what the President has been calling for since the beginning of his administration, and that&#8217;s what we want to see and that&#8217;s what we encourage Congress to do.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And Senator Schumer has signaled that they have roughly 10 days to get to a conclusion.&nbsp; Is that a timeline that the White House wants to see?&nbsp; And if at the end of that 10 days there is no agreement, the White House wants to see the Senate move forward on the two House-passed bills?<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Again, we leave the mechanics to Senator Schumer.&nbsp; We want to see action.&nbsp; That is what we&#8217;re calling for.<br><br>And &#8212; but again, we leave it to the leadership &#8212; the Democratic leadership to figure out how they&#8217;re going to move this forward.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And just one quick one: Can you give us any sense &#8212; has the President talked to other officials in Texas since Tuesday &#8212; or who he&#8217;s talked to on the phone about what happened down there?<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have any &#8212; any calls to preview.&nbsp;<br><br>Clearly, the President is very much &#8212; and the First Lady &#8212; is looking forward to meeting with the families, community leaders when they&#8217;re there on Sunday.<br><br>We have been trying to give the families some time to grieve, as this just happened two days ago.&nbsp; But again, he&#8217;s going to see them on Sunday and have that opportunity to offer comfort.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karine, are you getting any sense that this time is different, that there&#8217;s a different climate on Capitol Hill that might be inclined to do some &#8212; some things?<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; So, I&#8217;ll say this, Steve: You know, we have seen two horrific tragedies in just two weeks.&nbsp; Hours before the shooting, many of the 19 kids who were killed in Texas, Uvalde, were being awarded certificates of the Robb &#8212; of the Robb Elementary’s Honor Roll ceremony as part of the end of the school year.&nbsp; Today would have been their last day of school and &#8212; for the school year.<br><br>In Buffalo, on the same day &#8212; on the same day that this happened just two days ago, 2 of the 10 people who were killed while going to the grocery store on a Sunday, like many of us do, were being buried and honored by their families.&nbsp; I&#8217;m talking about Aaron Salter, the security officer who first responded, and Celestine Chaney, a mother and grandmother of six, were being buried by loved ones right in Buffalo on that same day.<br><br>So, America has more guns than people in this country.&nbsp; If more guns were indeed the solution, we would be the safest country in the world, but we are not.<br><br>And so, the President has been very clear he wants action &#8212; he wants Congress to take action.&nbsp; He wants to turn this pain into action.&nbsp;<br><br>And I hope the Senate, and particularly those who have been unwilling to act in the face of previous tragedies, will act now.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s what we are hoping and urging Congress to do.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the President considering some unilateral actions on guns?&nbsp; There are a number of gun safety advocates who are pushing for things like a gun czar or a state of emergency declaration.<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; So, on your first part, you know, while we&#8217;ve been calling for Congress to act, and the President has done that since the first couple of days of the White House, he has been waiting, right?&nbsp; We have talked about the things &#8212; the comprehensive approaches that he&#8217;s taken.<br><br>We recently announced how over $10 billion from the Rescue Plan has been spent or committed on ways to fight gun &#8212; gun crime and gun violence.&nbsp; The President wants cities and states to use even more.&nbsp; The department &#8212; the Justice Department issued a tough new rule to stem the flow of ghost guns, which are increasingly being found at the crime scenes and which are the weapons of choice for terrorists and criminals.<br><br>So, the administration &#8212; the administration issued a zero-tolerance policy for gun dealers who willfully sell guns illegally.&nbsp;<br><br>So, this President has done more via executive actions than any other President during their first year of office.&nbsp;<br><br>Now, what we are asking for is for Congress &#8212; we are urging them to take action.&nbsp;<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Karine.&nbsp; How does the President view his role in this moment?&nbsp; You know, we talked yesterday about changing a dynamic &#8212; a dynamic that&#8217;s been entrenched for decades now at this point.<br><br>I understand the legislative details are Capitol Hill&#8217;s prerogative.&nbsp; How does he view his role in trying to change that dynamic?<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Well, I think he &#8212; he views his role has as he has been doing.<br><br>You know, if you think about his remarks on Tuesday, it was &#8212; it was compassion, it was sadness, it &#8212; it was outrage.<br><br>And you heard that from &#8212; from the President of the United States, basically saying “enough is enough.”&nbsp; And this is something that he understands personally.&nbsp; This is a President who has worked on gun violence during his Senate years, as Vice President, and has leadership already from the first couple of days of stepping into this administration.<br><br>So, we have done &#8212; we have done our part.&nbsp; Will there be more executive actions and will we do more?&nbsp; We&#8217;ll look into that.&nbsp; We&#8217;re always looking to do more.&nbsp; But, right now, we need the help of Congress.&nbsp; We need them to step in and to deal with this gun violence that we&#8217;re seeing that&#8217;s tearing up not just families but communities across the country.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You were on &#8212;<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Oh &#8212;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just one more quick one.<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah, yeah.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You were on Air Force One.&nbsp; Can you talk about the President&#8217;s reaction when he got the news,&nbsp;when more details started to come out over the course of those hours &#8212; those final hours on the flight, and as he prepared for his remarks on Tuesday night, which he echoed on Wednesday?<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; As you said, Phil, I was with the President on the plane, on Air Force One, because we were coming back from Asia, and I got to see him right before he delivered the speech.&nbsp;<br><br>Honestly, I will &#8212; would leave the speech to stand for itself.&nbsp; You heard his emotion.&nbsp; You heard what he said very, very clearly.&nbsp; And again, you heard the outrage, which we heard &#8212; which we saw from some of you on TV, from some of you who &#8212; some of your colleagues who are in Texas who were talking to families on the ground, the communities on the ground &#8212; the outrage, the sadness, the grief.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s what you heard from this President.&nbsp;<br><br>And, you know, he said a couple of things that I think it&#8217;s important to reiterate, as we &#8212; as we really think about what happened &#8212; is that, you know, there are parents who will never see their child again, parents who will never be the same.&nbsp; And the President said, “To lose a child is like having a piece of your soul ripped away…It’s suffocating.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s never quite the same.&nbsp; And it’s a feeling shared by…their family members, and the community that&#8217;s left behind.”&nbsp;<br><br>So that is the Pres- &#8212; the President’s focus right now.&nbsp; He’s going to go, clearly, on Sunday to offer his comfort, to grieve with the family and the community.&nbsp; But at the same time, he is going to call on Congress to take action because it&#8217;s been too long.&nbsp; And now is the time to act.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two quick things.&nbsp; First, apparently the company that sold the shooter his rifles received a $3 million PPP loan under the last administration.&nbsp; Do you know if there&#8217;s any effort by this administration to claw that money back?<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; So I &#8212; this is the first I’m hearing about this, so I would have to go back to the team and look into it.&nbsp; Do you know the name of the company?<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah, the name of the company is Daniel Defense &#8212; D-A-N-I-E-L Defense.&nbsp;&nbsp; Apparently, they received a, I think, $3.1 million PPP loan right at the beginning.&nbsp; My colleagues have been writing about it apparently today.&nbsp; But if &#8212; if &#8212; assuming that is confirmed, would the President, do you think, support the idea of trying to claw that money back?<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; I &#8212; honestly, Michael, I need to &#8212; to check with the team and just make sure that is actually factual.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; And then &#8212;<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; But I need to check with the team.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; I would appreciate that.&nbsp; And then &#8212;<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; And we’ll get back to on that.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; And then just, you know, going back to the question that I&#8217;m sure, you know, everybody has been asking, which is the, sort of “what is the President going to do and can do,” you talk a lot about the outrage.&nbsp; You talk a lot about that he wants Congress to act.&nbsp; You talk a lot about the emotion.&nbsp; I was in this room &#8212; I think a lot of the other people &#8212; a lot of people here were too &#8212; when the President Obama cried at that very podium hours after the Newtown &#8212; Newtown shootings.&nbsp;<br><br>There have been a million shootings since then, lots of expressions of outrage, lots of expressions of wanting the &#8212; wanting Congress to act.&nbsp; They haven&#8217;t.&nbsp;<br><br>I mean, there are people out there &#8212; saw several of them on TV today &#8212; who say this President needs to do more than all of that.&nbsp; This President needs to declare a national emergency.&nbsp; He needs to create task forces.&nbsp; He needs to create, you know, a czar of gun things.&nbsp; He needs to say he&#8217;s not leaving this building, cancel his vacations.&nbsp; Tell Congress &#8212; you know, members from Congress to get in a room and not &#8212; not leave until they &#8212; you know, until they got a solution, and not accept some of the sort of half measures that, you know, are sort of being offered.<br><br>And I guess the question is: Why &#8212; why isn’t he doing of that?<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; So, on the public health &#8212; on the emergency, he has already done that.&nbsp; The President has already declared gun violence to be a &#8212; to be a public health epidemic.&nbsp; He has done that already.&nbsp; And he has mobilized our federal departments and agencies, including the Department of Health Services, to respond.&nbsp; So that is &#8212; has been done.&nbsp;<br><br>Look, this is a President, as I&#8217;ve said already, who has been working on gun violence, gun reform &#8212; comprehensive gun reform since he was a senator.&nbsp; And he also was there, as you were talking about &#8212; you know, what President Biden &#8212; I mean, President Obama had to deal with.&nbsp; He was there.&nbsp; He was his partner in that and took on that &#8212; that portfolio of dealing with gun violence.&nbsp; He was there at the table.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But isn’t that more of an indictment than it is a plus to say that the current President has been involved in this for more than &#8212; you know, more than &#8212; you know for decades and it&#8217;s not being fixed?&nbsp; These things are happening over and over again.&nbsp;<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; But look, Michael, we are frustrated as well.&nbsp; We are angry as well.&nbsp;<br><br>Look, I said this earlier and I&#8217;ll say it again: This is a President who has done more via executive actions &#8212; this is how much of a priority this is for him, because we&#8217;re a year into his presidency &#8212; more via executive actions than any president in their first year.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But many &#8212; but many of those are not directly related to &#8212;<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Right.&nbsp; Which is why &#8212;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; the issues of mass shootings.&nbsp; They &#8212;<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Which &#8212;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; may be directly related &#8212;<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; I hear you.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; to guns, but &#8212; and that’s important &#8212; I’m not saying &#8212; but &#8212;<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Right.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; they’re not directly related to &#8212;<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Well, this is why we&#8217;re calling on Congress to act.&nbsp; The President is doing what &#8212; the President is your &#8212; the President is doing what he can &#8212; right? &#8212; from here, from the White House.&nbsp;<br><br>And now &#8212; and he has said he cannot do this alone.&nbsp; He has been very clear.&nbsp; We &#8212; he understands we need to do more, but Congress also has to act.&nbsp; He has done a comprehensive plan on gun &#8212; on gun violence.&nbsp; We have listed that out.<br><br>Every couple of months, we talk about what he&#8217;s doing, what executive action he&#8217;s taking.&nbsp; And now he is saying, “Congress needs to act.”&nbsp; And &#8212; but he has been saying that for some time.<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Go ahead, Kristen.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karine &#8212;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To the back please?<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Give me one second, please.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I just &#8212; I want to follow up on this idea, because the President campaigned on a promise to be able to bring Democrats and Republicans together to get the hard things done.&nbsp; Why has he not been able to bring them together to make this a legislative priority to even get a small measure done when it comes to (inaudible)?<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Well, I think that&#8217;s what Senator Schumer is trying to do.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah, but why not do that in the early days of his presidency?<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Well, we have been talking to Congress before these two shootings that have been clearly very public and very devastating and horrific in this past two weeks.&nbsp; We&#8217;re doing it now.&nbsp;<br><br>Look, we know that this is not easy.&nbsp; We&#8217;re not saying that this is easy.&nbsp; And the President is doing everything that he can to get this done, but we have &#8212; we&#8217;re going to continue to call on Congress to act.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does this now move to the top of his &#8212;<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; It’s a priority.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; legislative priorities, above Build Back Better &#8212;<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; It’s &#8212;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; above COVID relief?&nbsp; Does this now need to be the singular focus of &#8212;<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; I’ve &#8212;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; all of Washington D.C.?<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Kristen, I would argue that this has been a top priority from the &#8212; from the time &#8212;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the singular focus for the President and lawmakers?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; I&#8217;m &#8212; I&#8217;m not going to list out his &#8212; the one, two, or three of priority.&nbsp; What I can tell you is this has been a top priority.&nbsp; Literally, he &#8212; he started working on this the first couple of days he walked into the &#8212; into &#8212; into this office.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And you’re getting a lot of questions about the czar.&nbsp; I guess, just to ask more spe- &#8212; to ask in a different way: Former President Obama appointed then-Vice President Biden to take control of this issue.&nbsp; Are there any discussions &#8212; is the President considering tasking his Vice President with trying to get something done on this issue?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Look, we &#8212; we have Ambassador Susan Rice, who is the President&#8217;s domestic policy advisor, as you all know, and she is coordinating the President&#8217;s whole-of-government approach to reducing gun violence.</p>



<p>She has decades of experience coordinating interagency processes in the federal government.&nbsp; There is no one better at bringing department heads to the table to drive the process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She has a team of 12 staff under the Domestic Policy Council who are working on gun violence reduction, taking an interdisciplinary approach that recognizes that we need all sorts of expertise at the table, from mental health to criminal justice to housing to education, to address the issue.</p>



<p>In addition to the Domestic Policy Council, there&#8217;s the Executive Office of the President, the White House Counsel&#8217;s Office, the Office of the Intergovernmental Affairs, and the Office of Public Engagement.&nbsp; All are playing key roles in gun violence prevention, as do several of the federal agencies, which I&#8217;ve listed out already.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karine, given everything you just laid out, and the President said yesterday he will use every tool that&#8217;s available, I guess, why hasn&#8217;t he stood up a task force &#8212; an interagency task force on preventing gun violence?&nbsp; He has done it dozens of times on everything from COVID to unionizing since the start of his presidency.&nbsp; There&#8217;s also an outstanding request, I believe, from House Democrats over the past year that he appoint a national director &#8212; I guess a czar, as Kristen said &#8212; and start a task force.</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Well, I just &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is that something he is going to consider?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; I just walked through a whole-of-government approach that we&#8217;re taking &#8212; that&#8217;s how important this is &#8212; across departments here at the White House and also with several agencies.&nbsp; We&#8217;re talking about the DOJ &#8212; Department of Justice.&nbsp; We&#8217;re talking about HHS.&nbsp; All very much involved here on &#8212; on how we&#8217;re moving forward.</p>



<p>You know &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, I guess, why not make an official interagency task force?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Because we have a whole-of-government approach.&nbsp; We have a whole-of-government approach that I just mentioned, that Ambassador Susan Rice is leading, along with other departments.</p>



<p>And &#8212; and with that whole-of-government approach, we have been able to put forth executive actions at a level that we have not seen from any other presidents.&nbsp; We have been able to deal with this in a comprehensive way.</p>



<p>What we are saying right now is that we need help.&nbsp; We need assistance.&nbsp; The President cannot do this alone.&nbsp; The Congress needs to act.&nbsp; They need to pass legislation so that we can deal with this on a federal level &#8212; legislative level.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last question: Is the President making any &#8212; or is he considering calling or reaching out to the BORTAC agent who was injured in Uvalde while he was protecting students during the shooting?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have any &#8212; I don&#8217;t have anything to preview or read out for you.&nbsp; As I &#8212; as you know &#8212; as you know, he&#8217;s going to &#8212; on Sunday, he&#8217;s going to be meeting with community leaders, he&#8217;s going to be meeting with victims and family members.&nbsp; And so, we&#8217;ll have more to share.&nbsp; I just don&#8217;t have anything to share at this time.</p>



<p>Okay.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll go to the back.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Go ahead.&nbsp; Go ahead.&nbsp; Go ahead.&nbsp; It’s hard to &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to ask you a question about the school shooting.&nbsp; But before that, I want to ask you a quick one about the FDA and the baby formula shortage there.&nbsp; It&#8217;s lasted months, and we&#8217;re not just talking about baby formula, either.&nbsp; There are infants, children, and adults with different metabolic disorders who are risking permanent, irreversible damage the longer they go without special formulas that are manufactured at Abbott Nutrition.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m wondering, does the President have confidence in the FDA’s ability to deal with situations like this?&nbsp; And as he&#8217;s been monitoring the situation, does he still have confidence in his FDA director?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Yes and yes.&nbsp; So the FDA has an important mission, right?&nbsp; It’s to make sure that the infant formula on the shelf isn&#8217;t just available but also that it&#8217;s safe.&nbsp; And as a parent, I understand the frustration, I understand the fear of not mak- &#8212; not knowing if you have safe and healthy food, baby formula in this case, to &#8212; for your kids.</p>



<p>Unlike, you know, Republicans in Congress and the previous administration, the President believes that FDA, and particularly its food division, needs to be well resourced to do its critical work and do regular annual inspection.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So we have to just take a little bit of &#8212; just give me a second here &#8212; take a step back.</p>



<p>The current shortage exists because Abbott closed, as you &#8212; as you know, a facility in Michigan due to safety concerns from the FDA &#8212; a facility that was a major producer of specialty formula, as you&#8217;re asking me about, right?&nbsp; And so FDA has an obligation to protect the American people, and that&#8217;s what Dr. Califf is going to be doing at the helm.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then the second que- &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; But &#8212; go ahead.&nbsp; Go ahead.&nbsp; You have a follow-up.&nbsp; Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second question.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve been having a lot of conversations about specifics when it comes to mass shootings, whether it&#8217;s red flag laws or background checks.&nbsp; Getting down to, though brass tacks, what does the President believe, at this point, is the purpose of the Second Amendment?&nbsp; And does he think that, given some of the tragedies that we&#8217;ve seen, that there should be a discussion about, you know, its ultimate purpose and whether or not it&#8217;s currently in date?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; So the President has been very clear: What he is calling for is commonsense gun reform.&nbsp; That&#8217;s it.&nbsp; He&#8217;s calling for commonsense gun reform to make sure that if you go to a church, you go to elementary school, you go to a grocery store, that you&#8217;re not gunned down.&nbsp; That&#8217;s what he&#8217;s asking for.</p>



<p>It has &#8212; we&#8217;re not talking about the Second Amendment or &#8212; or doing anything to &#8212; to get rid of the Second Amendment.&nbsp; We&#8217;re talking about making sure &#8212; 19 &#8212; 19 kids and two teachers died.&nbsp; That&#8217;s the second major mass shooting that has &#8212; has occurred in two weeks.&nbsp; And that &#8212; we&#8217;re not even talking about the crime that we see, the gun violence that we see across the country on a regular basis.</p>



<p>So we have to make sure that we have gun reform.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re &#8212; we&#8217;re calling on Congress to act.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Karine.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karine?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Okay, okay.&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Go ahead, April.&nbsp; I’m trying to stay in the back.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karine, I want to ask you about an issue that&#8217;s been in the news nationally and internationally: the grains issue.<br><br>House Foreign &#8212; House Foreign Affairs Committee Chair Greg Meeks is in Europe meeting with world leaders on the issue.&nbsp; He says that&#8217;s all people are really talking about right now, is the grains issue.&nbsp; And as you know, there&#8217;s a blockade of the Black Sea.&nbsp; Russia’s blocked &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Yeah, the export.&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; there’s a blockade of the Black Sea for the exports of grain, and also India is having problems.&nbsp; So the issue is Russia.</p>



<p>Will this White House look at relenting when it comes to issues of sanctions against Russia to allow the grains to go out?&nbsp; Because, right now, Meeks is saying the issue is starvation, as well as prices in the grocery store.<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; So, I th- &#8212; so the question that you&#8217;re asking about, if I&#8217;m getting this right, is, like, Russia is &#8212; has made a proposal to us to &#8212; to allow exports in exchange for lifting the sanctions?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes.</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; And so, you know, we want to be very, very clear here, because this is very important: This is Russia who is actively blocking the export of food from Ukrainian ports and is increasing world hunger.&nbsp; This is on them.</p>



<p>Russia should immediately cease its war on Ukraine, which is devastating global food security, and allow the free flow of Ukrainian food.</p>



<p>Before Russia attacked Ukraine in February, Ukraine was the world&#8217;s largest export of sunflower oil; the fourth largest export of corn, which is what you&#8217;re asking about, April, with the wheat; and one of the largest exports of wheat, this &#8212; what you&#8217;re asking about.</p>



<p>Now, there are tons of products sitting in se- &#8212; in silos in Ukraine and on ships that are unable to set sail due to Russia&#8217;s naval blockade.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So &#8212; and to be clear about some- &#8212; something that has been the subject of Russian disinformation: Sanctions from the United States and its allies and its partners are not preventing the export of Ukrainian or Russian agriculture, including food and fertilizer, nor are they preventing the ordinary transactions that are necessary for these exports, such as banking or shipping.</p>



<p>Therefore, even according to the terms of their own apparent proposal that they have presented &#8212; presented us, Russia should immediately allow Ukrainian agricultural exports.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So there is no &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; there is no conversation at all about lifting sanctions?&nbsp; You’re saying &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; No.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; no?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; There &#8212; there is not.&nbsp; Remember, again, this is Russia’s doing.&nbsp; This is on Russia.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karine?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karine?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Oh, my gosh.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On formula?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All the way back.&nbsp; All the way back.&nbsp; (Laughter.)</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Go ahead, Nadia.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you so much.&nbsp; I have two foreign policy questions.</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Sure.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, a team from the White House is visiting Saudi Arabia, led by Brett McGurk.&nbsp; Is the President still trying to convince the Saudis to increase the production of oil?&nbsp; And is this part of preparation for the President&#8217;s visit to Saudi Arabia?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; So, I don&#8217;t have anything to preview at this time on &#8212; on a &#8212; on a trip or a visit from the President.&nbsp;<br><br>I will confirm that Brett McGurk and Amos Hochstein were in the region to follow up on conversations on a range of &#8212; range of issues, including Iran&#8217;s disab- &#8212; destabilizing activities, ensuring stable global energy supplies, and other regional issues.<br><br>On your question about oil, you know, it’s &#8212; this trip is to review engagement with Saudi Arabia on energy security, as asking for oil is simply wrong &#8212; that’s the way that we see it &#8212; and a misunderstanding of both the complexity of that issue, as well as our multifaceted discussions with the Saudis.</p>



<p>OPEC-Plus will make its own decision as it relates to this, the oil, and as it always has.&nbsp; We are in consultation with all relevant producers about market conditions, including Saudi Arabia.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have one more, please, on Syria.&nbsp; The head of the Lebanese intelligence chief have met with people at the White House.&nbsp; He told me in an interview that you raised the question of American hostages in Syria held by the Syrian regime.&nbsp; Can you update us on the case on &#8212; specifically on Austin Tice and whether his release is imminent?&nbsp; I know it&#8217;s sensitive because you’re talking to the families.</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; So, as you know, this &#8212; it&#8217;s a very sensitive issue.&nbsp; And so, this is not &#8212; it&#8217;s not something that I want to comment from here, so I won&#8217;t.&nbsp; I just can&#8217;t.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t want to do that just because of &#8212; it’s diplomatic negotiations, and I want to leave it in that space.</p>



<p>(Cross-talk by reporters.)</p>



<p>I’ll come back.</p>



<p>Go ahead.&nbsp; Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Has the White House detected any mood shift that makes you optimistic after this shooting that something is finally going to happen, that something is finally going to get passed after 19 children were shot down?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; So, you know, we don&#8217;t have our finger on the pulse of &#8212; on the mood.&nbsp; What we can do is continue to fight for American families, for American communities, as we see the violence that has &#8212; especially the two major &#8212; major tragedies that we&#8217;ve seen these last two weeks &#8212; and call on Congress to act.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The President, again &#8212; and I&#8217;ve stated this &#8212; he has taken executive actions over this past year and a half, which is more &#8212; again, more than any President has done in its first term.&nbsp; And he cannot do this alone.&nbsp;<br><br>And so, he &#8212; he is going to leave it to Senator Schumer, who is doing the &#8212; going through the mechanics of what that&#8217;s going to look like moving &#8212; moving legislation forward.&nbsp;<br><br>And so, we appreciate their efforts.&nbsp; We appreciate his effort.&nbsp; We appreciate the Speaker&#8217;s effort.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re going to continue to have those conversations, as we have been throughout this past year and a half.&nbsp;<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Karine.&nbsp; So, after the President visited with families in Buffalo, he was asked, “What more can you do on guns via executive action?”&nbsp; And he said, quote, “Not much on executive action.”<br><br>As Steve said, there are multiple gun safety groups that disagree with that statement and have pages of &#8212; of executive actions that they think the President can take.&nbsp; Does the President have any plans to meet with gun safety advocates?&nbsp; I know when he was Vice President, he had hundreds of meetings in the EEOB in his office there with groups.&nbsp; Does he plan to meet with them?&nbsp; And if not, why not?<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; So, I don&#8217;t have anything to preview.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not &#8212; not at this time.&nbsp;<br><br>I &#8212; you know, I just talked about Susan Rice and her team, the Domestic Policy Council.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve talked about the public engagement team and others, DOJ and also HHS.&nbsp;<br><br>And those teams have been regularly talking to outside experts, outside groups over the course of this past year and a half.&nbsp; That&#8217;s how we were able to put forward these executive action, comprehensive effort to deal with gun reform.&nbsp; So, that conversations &#8212; those conversations are going to continue.&nbsp; I just don&#8217;t have anything to preview for you on this one.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Inaudible) on the meetings, but just in terms of that sentiment where &#8212; where the President says there&#8217;s not much more on executive action that he can do.&nbsp; Does this shooting in Texas change that at all?<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; I think what he is &#8212; I &#8212; just to speak to that: Look, the President has done a lot.&nbsp; He really has.&nbsp; The fact that I&#8217;m able to state this historical fact of how much &#8212; how much he&#8217;s done in his first year and a half.<br><br>But, you know, we&#8217;re always looking at what else we can do.&nbsp; But we have done &#8212; you know, we have done so much.&nbsp; I just read it out &#8212; including stemming the flow of ghost guns, cracking down on gun trafficking, and using the American Rescue Plan funds to invest in keeping officers on the beat to fight gun crime and gun violence.<br><br>And so, we&#8217;re going to continue constantly looking at additional executive action so we can move forward.<br><br>But the President, again, cannot solve this problem alone.&nbsp; He needs Congress to do its job and to act.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On that point: What role do you guys expect Senator McConnell to play on any sort of bipartisan gun legislation?&nbsp; Does the President plan to contact him or speak with him at all?&nbsp; And what are you hoping for from the Senate Minority Leader?<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Look &#8212; you know, again, we&#8217;re going to leave the mechanics to how this gets done to the leadership &#8212; to the leadership in Congress, Senator Schumer and Speaker Pelosi.<br><br>We have had several conversations before these major shootings that occurred these last two weeks.&nbsp; This is an issue that has been a priority for this President since the moment he walked in &#8212; into this office and, as I mentioned, as a senator, as a Vice President, and now as President.<br><br>So, there&#8217;s an array of issues that we talk to Congress on a regular basis.&nbsp; And again, we&#8217;re going to continue to have those conversations.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the gun issue, just a quick follow-up: Is one of the concerns of the White House that moving ahead with executive actions right now while there are talks in Congress could sink those talks in Congress?&nbsp; Is that why you’re holding &#8212; one of the reasons you might be holding back on moving forward with the executive actions?<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; No.&nbsp; I mean, we’ve been very clear: It’s time for Congress to act.&nbsp; We cannot do this alone.&nbsp; The President cannot do this alone.&nbsp; So, we’re asking Congress to act so we can have federal laws to actually deal with reforming &#8212; reforming &#8212; doing gun reform &#8212; comprehensive gun reform.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the Summit of the Americas, President Bolsonaro of Brazil has said he plans to attend now.&nbsp; AMLO, of Mexico, is still making mixed signals.&nbsp; Can you say whether those invitations have now formally gone out to all of those leaders?&nbsp; And are the governments of Venezuela and Cuba and Nicaragua going to be excluded?<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; So, we&#8217;re still considering additional invites, and we&#8217;ll share them when &#8212; when it &#8212; we feel it&#8217;s appropriate &#8212; when it&#8217;s final.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s when we&#8217;ll share them.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have anything right now to share as far as a fi- &#8212; as a list.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then just one last one.<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Mm-hmm.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The CBO came out with a report earlier this week that showed inflation was going to remain above target toward the &#8212; well, going down but still above target to the end of this year and then into next year.&nbsp; I mean, has the White House, sort of, painted too rosy a picture on how quickly inflation is going to go down, given the projections that came out from CBO this week?<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; So, a couple of things.&nbsp; So, as you mentioned, the CBO report came out yesterday.&nbsp; It projects stable, steady economic growth in the year &#8212; in the years ahead, as inflation eases, the deficit falls dramatically this year.<br><br>On the deficit, the CBO projects that our deficit this year will fall by $1.7 trillion, after it fell by $350 billion just last year.&nbsp; That’s after the deficit increased every single year President Trump was in office.&nbsp; And it is a lower deficit for 2022 than the CBO projected before passage of the American Rescue Plan.&nbsp; That means that our econo- &#8212; our strong economic recovery, powered by the President’s economic and vaccination policies also improved our nation’s fiscal position and reduced our deficit.<br><br>On growth and inflation, CBO projects the economy to grow by 3.1 percent this year and 2.2 percent next year, with core personal con- &#8212; consumption <s>exemption</s> [expenditures] &#8212; that’s PCE &#8212; inflation falling to 2.3 percent by the end of next year.&nbsp; This is the kind of transition from a historic economic recovery &#8212; again, steady, stable economic growth that works for working families &#8212; that President &#8212; that the President’s policies are designed to bring about.&nbsp;<br><br>So that’s how we’re &#8212; how we’re viewing the CBO report.&nbsp;<br><br>Go ahead, you had something on formula you said?<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; Can you tell us if there are any more flights planned from &#8212; foreign flights for formula?<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have anything to &#8212; to preview at this time.&nbsp; But we will have some more information in the upcoming days.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is that because you all are working on it and the details are not there or can we expect more flights?<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Yeah, definitely, you&#8217;ll expect more flights.&nbsp; I just don&#8217;t have anything to announce at this time.&nbsp; And, as you know, the second flight landed in Dulles yesterday.&nbsp; The First Lady was there to receive the &#8212; the formula and the &#8212; and the package that landed.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then on the FDA question: You said &#8212; you brought up the Abbott plant, and it was kind of put on them.&nbsp; But Senator Patty Murray &#8212; today, she told the FDA head that she gives the FDA an “F” on not realizing the warning signs of the crisis.&nbsp; And she also says that they have not given her a plan that she&#8217;s requested about how to stabilize a food safety program.&nbsp; So is there anything the White House can ensure that the FDA has been in response to Senator Murray and those on Capitol Hill?<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; So, let me just first say this &#8212; this is &#8212; they’re hearing &#8212; during the hearing yesterday, Dr. Califf has said, “It’s important we get to the bottom of what happened with the &#8212; with the Sturgis facility and the root of what has caused the issues we’re facing today.”&nbsp; He has designated someone to lead an after-action report.<br><br>But we have to take a step back here and look at the dynamics of what we&#8217;re dealing with: We have fau- &#8212; four companies that make up 98 percent of the market.&nbsp; An industry that’s &#8212; that’s concentrated means more vulnerability to the supply shocks and fewer options for consumption.<br><br>And because of Abbott’s vol- &#8212; voluntary recall, there have been huge disruptions to formula supply of a highly concentrated market.&nbsp; So we have to fix this.<br><br>So, our focus right now is on getting more infant formula supply to families across the country as quickly as possible, as well running a historic agenda to diversify markets and grow the number of companies competing for &#8212; for your business.&nbsp; This is what &#8212; this is what will &#8212; will help avoid situations like this in the future.<br><br>But he has said it is important to get to the bottom of this and has appointed someone to do that.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Karine.&nbsp;<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Thank you, everybody.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
