<p>As we approach the 20<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, we must never forget the enduring pain of the families and loved ones of the 2,977 innocent people who were killed. For them, 9/11 was not only a national and international tragedy; it was a personal devastation. For 20 years, children have grown up without parents. Husbands and wives have had to find a way forward without their partners in life. Brothers and sisters, mothers and fathers, have celebrated 20 years of birthdays, family gatherings, and milestones, all with a hole in their hearts. I know well the all-consuming grief of losing someone you love so suddenly. I can only imagine the added pain these families have endured, spending 20 years pursuing accountability and justice.<br><br>As I promised during my campaign, my Administration is committed to ensuring the maximum degree of transparency under the law, and to adhering to the rigorous guidance issued during the Obama-Biden Administration on the invocation of the state secrets privilege. In this vein, I welcome the Department of Justice’s filing today, which commits to conducting a fresh review of documents where the government has previously asserted privileges, and to doing so as quickly as possible.<br><br>My heart and my prayers continue to be with the 9/11 families who are suffering, and my Administration will continue to engage respectfully with members of this community. I welcome their voices and insight as we chart a way forward.</p>

<p>I strongly support Secretary Austin’s message to the Force today on the Department of Defense’s plan to add the COVID-19 vaccine to the list of required vaccinations for our service members not later than mid-September. Secretary Austin and I share an unshakable commitment to making sure our troops have every tool they need to do their jobs as safely as possible. These vaccines will save lives. Period. They are safe. They are effective. Over 350 million shots have been given in the United States alone. Being vaccinated will enable our service members to stay healthy, to better protect their families, and to ensure that our force is ready to operate anywhere in the world. We cannot let up in the fight against COVID-19, especially with the Delta variant spreading rapidly through unvaccinated populations. We are still on a wartime footing, and every American who is eligible should take immediate steps to get vaccinated right away. I am proud that our military women and men will continue to help lead the charge in the fight against this pandemic, as they so often do, by setting the example of keeping their fellow Americans safe.</p>

<p>One year ago today, the people of Belarus sought to make their voices heard and shape their own future through that most basic expression of democracy—an election. Rather than respect the clear will of the Belarusian people, the Lukashenka regime perpetrated election fraud, followed by a brutal campaign of repression to stifle dissent. From detaining thousands of peaceful protesters, to imprisoning more than 500 activists, civil society leaders, and journalists as political prisoners, to forcing the diversion of an international flight in an affront to global norms, the actions of the Lukashenka regime are an illegitimate effort to hold on to power at any price. It is the responsibility of all those who care about human rights, free and fair elections, and freedom of expression to stand against this oppression. The United States will continue to stand up for human rights and free expression, while holding the Lukashenka regime accountable, in concert with our allies and partners. Toward that end, today, we are issuing a new Executive Order that enhances our ability to impose costs on the regime and announcing new sanctions against Belarusian individuals and entities for their role in attacks on democracy and human rights, transnational repression, and corruption. As I told the leader of the Belarusian opposition, Svyatlana Tsikhanouskaya, we stand with the people of Belarus as they bravely pursue their democratic aspirations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>Today, on the anniversary of the fraudulent Belarusian election of August 9, 2020, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. signed an Executive Order (E.O.) imposing further consequences upon Alyaksandr Lukashenka and his regime for their ongoing assault against the democratic aspirations and human rights of the Belarusian people, transnational repression and abuse, affronts to international norms, and corruption.</p>



<p>This E.O. provides strengthened authorities that empower the United States to raise the costs on the Lukashenka regime. Specifically, this E.O. expands the scope of the national emergency declared in E.O. 13405 of June 16, 2006, by authorizing the imposition of blocking sanctions on persons operating in certain identified sectors of the Belarus economy, including the&nbsp;defense and related materiel sector, security sector, energy sector, potassium chloride (potash) sector, tobacco products sector,&nbsp;construction sector, transportation sector, or any other sector of the Belarus economy as may be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State.</p>



<p>The U.S. Department of the Treasury is also issuing its largest round of sanctions to date against Belarusian individuals and entities pursuant to E.O. 13405 as well as the E.O. of August 9, 2021, including:</p>



<ul><li>Belaruskali OAO, which is one of Belarus’s largest state-owned enterprises, one of the world’s largest producers of potash, and a source of illicit wealth for the regime;<br></li><li>The Belarusian National Olympic Committee, which is accused of facilitating money laundering, sanctions evasion, and the circumvention of visa bans, and which the International Olympic Committee has publicly reprimanded for its failure to protect Belarusian athletes from political discrimination and repression;<br></li><li>Prominent businesspeople who support the Lukashenka regime as well as fifteen companies with which they are affiliated – including Absolutbank, a private Belarusian bank; and,<br></li><li>Additional entities that operate in the tobacco products, construction, energy, and transportation sectors of the Belarus economy.</li></ul>



<p>Democratic countries are strongest when we stand together. The United States welcomes the coordinated steps taken today by the United Kingdom and Canada against the Lukashenka regime and measures announced by the European Union on June 24.</p>



<p>In May, when Belarus forced the diversion of a commercial Ryanair flight, President Biden pledged to “develop appropriate options to hold accountable those responsible” and “to stand with the people of Belarus in their struggle.” Since then, the regime has only further expanded it repression, including by threatening the safety of an Olympic athlete outside its borders. With today’s actions, President Biden is abiding by his pledge to hold the Belarussian regime accountable for its abuses. The Biden administration’s position remains clear: the Lukashenka regime must permit a legitimate international investigation into the Ryanair flight diversion; it must immediately release all political prisoners; it must stop targeting activists and dissidents, including across borders, and it must initiate a genuine and comprehensive political dialogue with democratic opposition and civil society figures that results in a free and fair presidential election under OSCE observation.</p>



<p>Absent such steps, the U.S. government will continue to use this E.O. and other authorities to impose costs on the Lukashenka regime and its support network for enabling corruption, human rights abuses, transnational repression, and attacks against democratic freedoms and international norms.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>Dear Madam Speaker: (Dear Madam President:)<br><br>Pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 <em>et seq.</em>), I hereby report that I have issued an Executive Order to expand the scope of the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13405 of June 16, 2006 (Blocking Property of Certain Persons Undermining Democratic Processes or Institutions in Belarus), finding that the Belarusian regime&#8217;s harmful activities and long-standing abuses aimed at suppressing democracy and the exercise of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Belarus &#8212; including illicit and oppressive activities stemming from the August 9, 2020, fraudulent Belarusian presidential election and its aftermath, such as the elimination of political opposition and civil society organizations and the regime&#8217;s disruption and endangering of international civil air travel &#8212; constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.  The order augments the sanctions designation criteria for current threats to United States national security and foreign policy interests posed by the Belarusian regime.  All executive departments and agencies are directed to take all appropriate measures within their authority to implement this order.<br><br>I am enclosing a copy of the Executive Order I have issued. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>New Funding Opportunities Will Target Disadvantaged Communities While Creating Good-Paying Jobs</em></p>



<p>Today, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is announcing three pre-disaster funding opportunities to help states and communities prepare for major disasters that are costing lives and livelihoods and devastating local communities and businesses. These programs will allow communities to apply for nearly $5 billion to increase their preparedness in advance of climate-related extreme weather events and other disasters, and improve their ability to recover after these events. In particular, FEMA is announcing the following:</p>



<ul><li>$1 billion in funding for its <a href="https://www.fema.gov/grants/mitigation/building-resilient-infrastructure-communities"><strong>Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC)</strong></a> program for Fiscal Year 2021. This new program, launched in 2020, provides grants to states, local communities, tribes, and territories to proactively reduce their vulnerability to natural hazard events before they occur, and make themselves and the nation more resilient. This year, the Biden Administration is doubling the program’s funding and implementing a number of changes to enhance funding opportunities for tribes and disadvantaged communities, including by changing program selection criteria and providing a larger allocation for tribes.</li></ul>



<ul><li>$3.46 billion in funding for its <a href="https://www.fema.gov/grants/mitigation/hazard-mitigation"><strong>Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP)</strong></a>. The 59 states, tribes, and territories that received a major disaster declaration in response to the COVID-19 pandemic will be eligible to receive 4% of the disaster costs related to their declaration to invest in mitigation projects that will help better prepare and protect communities from natural disasters and the impacts of climate change. The influx of funding will help communities prioritize mitigation needs for a more resilient future, including underserved communities that are often most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.</li></ul>



<ul><li>$160 million in funding for its <a href="https://www.fema.gov/grants/mitigation/floods"><strong>Flood Mitigation Assistance (FMA)</strong></a> grant program for Fiscal Year 2021 to reduce or eliminate the risks of repetitive flood damage to homes and buildings insured by the National Flood Insurance Program.</li></ul>



<p>These new funding opportunities support the President’s Build Back Better Agenda. This agenda includes historic investments to make our aging infrastructure more resilient in the face of increasingly severe floods, wildfires, droughts, hurricanes, and other risks. It also supports the President’s <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/briefing-room/2021/07/20/the-path-to-achieving-justice40/">Justice40 Initiative</a>, which set a goal of delivering at least 40% of the overall benefits of Federal investments in climate and clean energy to disadvantaged communities. Through these investments, we will advance environmental justice and equity, reduce the vulnerability of communities to disasters, promote individual and community safety, strengthen our ability as a nation to adapt to changing conditions, and reduce the burdens these changes place on our first responders.</p>



<p><strong><em>The High Costs of Extreme Weather and Climate-Related Disasters</em></strong></p>



<p>Climate change is a major driver for the increased frequency, duration, and severity of extreme weather and climate-related disasters. Millions of Americans feel the effects of these extreme events when their roads and schools flood, and hospitals lose power. Over the past few years, the frequency of extreme weather and climate-related disaster events with losses exceeding $1 billion has skyrocketed. From 2000 to 2009, these billion-dollar disasters occurred 6 times a year on average. From 2010 to 2020, that number increased to an average of 13 events per year, causing more than $975 billion in disaster damages over the decade. Last year alone, the United States faced $100 billion in damages to homes, businesses, and public infrastructure due to disasters. Annual deaths and monetary losses from these events have more than doubled.</p>



<p>Chronic underinvestment in American infrastructure has impacted our resilience. Failure to properly invest in our transportation systems can lead to disrupted service, unsafe travel conditions, severe damage, and increased maintenance and operating costs, deficiencies which disproportionately burden disadvantaged urban, rural, and tribal communities. Underinvestment in resilient electrical grids and water systems can leave people without power or clean water, create immediate peril, cause substantial economic dislocation, and impede swift recovery from a disaster.</p>



<p>Fortunately, we can decrease these human and infrastructure costs through smart pre-disaster investments. Studies have consistently shown FEMA hazard mitigation investments are cost effective and result in communities that are safer and more resilient to natural hazards, including impacts from climate change. Many of these investments will also create jobs in building and improving our infrastructure. An analysis of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act showed that investments in community resilience generated 15 to 33 jobs per million dollars spent and an economic return of $2.40 for every $1 invested.</p>



<p><strong><em>A Whole-of-Government Approach to Resilience and Equity</em></strong></p>



<p>The Biden Administration is taking steps to ensure that underserved communities will receive access to needed funds from these programs. As program pilots of the Justice40 Initiative, both the BRIC and FMA programs will immediately begin enhancing benefits for disadvantaged communities.</p>



<p>For example, FEMA has refined the BRIC program project selection criteria to send more benefits to those most in need. It will double the number of communities that can receive non-financial direct technical assistance in FY2021, through hands-on support with project development and other needs that help level the playing field for up to 20 disadvantaged communities. Pursuant to President Biden’s <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/20/executive-order-advancing-racial-equity-and-support-for-underserved-communities-through-the-federal-government/">Executive Order 13985, on <em>Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities through the Federal Government</em></a>, FEMA is also conducting an equity assessment for all of its hazard mitigation grant programs to address barriers and expand access for disadvantaged communities. In addition, the FMA program will employ the Social Vulnerability Index to prioritize funding in disadvantaged communities and utilize mapping assessment tools at the census tract level.</p>



<p>In addition to today’s FEMA announcements, we are coordinating efforts across agencies as part of the Biden Administration’s whole-of-government approach to increase resilience, get funding, and address the needs of communities across the country, including through task forces like the Department of Homeland Security’s DHS Climate Change Action Group. Through <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/27/executive-order-on-tackling-the-climate-crisis-at-home-and-abroad/">Executive Order 14008, on <em>Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad</em></a>, the President established the National Climate Task Force. The Task Force created five interagency working groups to support communities in addressing resilience strategies tied to <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/21/readout-of-the-third-national-climate-task-force-meeting/">drought</a>, wildfires, extreme heat, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/ceq/news-updates/2021/07/30/readout-of-the-white-house-coastal-resilience-interagency-working-group-convening/">coastal</a>, and flood risks. In addition, key agencies are supporting climate action by preparing plans to outline strategies to improve climate resilience. Under Executive Orders 14030,<em> Climate-Related Financial Risk,</em> and 14008, agencies are preparing reports on climate finance risk, improving climate forecasting, and providing information products to the public.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Via Teleconference<br>Wilmington, Delaware</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">(August 7, 2021)</p>



<p>6:06 P.M. EDT<br>&nbsp;<br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Well, thank you so very, very much.&nbsp; You know, I &#8212; I know you have a sense of it, but I don&#8217;t think you’ll appreciate until you get home how proud you made America &#8212; not just the winning more medals than anyone, and you may end up with as many gold before this is over as China.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>But here&#8217;s the deal: You really represented America.&nbsp; You represented the soul of the country, whether it was was &#8212; I mean, I thought when &#8212; when you were getting knocked down by an &#8212; an opponent on track and you ba- &#8212; you stop and then go back and pick him up and walk through the finish line with him &#8212; come on.&nbsp; That’s &#8212; that’s what America is supposed to be about.&nbsp; And you represented every single thing that we stand for.&nbsp; You really did.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And I just think that &#8212; you know, look, it wasn&#8217;t just &#8212; for a lot of the ath- &#8212; a lot of you, it wasn&#8217;t just your athletic ability; it was your moral courage &#8212; the courage you showed, the courage of those who were under real pressure and intellec- &#8212; and pressure &#8212; psychological pressure and being able to, like &#8212; like what Katie Ledecky &#8212; what Ledecky did.&nbsp; She wasn’t under the pressure; she just went out and won.&nbsp; She just won everything that was in front of her.&nbsp; And I &#8212; I don&#8217;t know if she&#8217;s online &#8212; I can&#8217;t see her &#8212; but, Katie, if you&#8217;re on here, I realize that you can probably swim a mile quicker than most people could run a mile.&nbsp; It&#8217;s just amazing all &#8212; just all you’ve done.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And, you know, when we talk about &#8212; all of us &#8212; like Simone Biles.&nbsp; I mean, the courage you had to get back up on that beam after &#8212; at the very end, and you still win the bronze.&nbsp; I mean, you showed everything about who we are as a people.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And watching your families &#8212; watching your families was as exciting almost as watching you guys.&nbsp; I mean, they were<br>overjoyed.&nbsp; And they were &#8212; I mean &#8212; and &#8212; and I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s harder Olympics to get &#8212; get ready for.&nbsp; You guys are &#8212; you know, you&#8217;re &#8212; you practiced for four years.&nbsp; You got ready and then COVID hit, and you had to wait another year.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And I just think you&#8217;re &#8212; I just can&#8217;t tell you how &#8212; you know, you remind us of what an amazing country we are, and you make us look so good as a country.&nbsp; These are the things that people look at around the world, more than anything that I do as your President or other people do in public life.&nbsp; They get the impression of who we are as Americans &#8212; who we are.&nbsp; And you&#8217;re &#8212; and you handled yourself with such grace and such &#8212; such &#8212; such decency.&nbsp; It just &#8212; you made me so damn proud.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>THE FIRST LADY:&nbsp; And I &#8212; I wanted &#8212; I wanted to just say thank you for the warm welcome that I received when I went to Tokyo.&nbsp; And so I saw a first: I saw the three-on-three basketball game.&nbsp; Everything &#8212; everything I saw, we won.&nbsp; I was so &#8212; I was so happy.&nbsp; And I saw the soccer game, and I saw the swimming, and I saw softball.&nbsp; And it was just &#8212; I mean, it was so exciting just to watch &#8212; just to watch you compete.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And like Joe said, you did it with such dignity and grace with all that you’ve been through these past few years &#8212; you know, the training and waiting and waiting.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And &#8212; and we just &#8212; you know, as the President and First Lady, I mean, we just could not feel more proud of all of you and everything you did in representing our country.&nbsp; And the &#8212; and all Americans feel the exact same way.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>When you come home, you&#8217;ll see everybody is glued to their TVs to see what&#8217;s going to happen next.&nbsp; And you made us proud, and I want to thank you so much.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And it was just great.&nbsp; I couldn&#8217;t talk to a lot of you, but at least I could wave from the sidelines and &#8212; and represent our country.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So, thank you for the opportunity, for allowing me to &#8212; to be there to represent you.<br>&nbsp;<br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; And, by the way, the Japanese Prime Minister is a very smart guy.&nbsp; He&#8217;s a friend.&nbsp; I know him.&nbsp; But he asked Jill to come and represent the country &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>THE FIRST LADY:&nbsp; (Laughs.)<br>&nbsp;<br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; &#8212; not me.&nbsp; So, you know, he really knows what he&#8217;s doing.&nbsp; He knows how to get things done.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>But I &#8212; I just can&#8217;t tell you, you all &#8212; you just made our hearts swell.&nbsp; Not a joke.&nbsp; You restored the soul of America in so many ways.&nbsp; You really, really did.&nbsp; That&#8217;s not hyperbole; that&#8217;s a fact.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>But I need a promise from all of you: You’ll all come see us in the White House in the fall.&nbsp; We&#8217;ll set a date you &#8212; and I&#8217;d love to have you all come to the White House if you&#8217;re &#8212; if you&#8217;re willing to do that, so the nation can see and I can brag more on you.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And the amba- &#8212; you know, our ambassador to the United Nations is Linda Thomas-Greenfield &#8212; was there.&nbsp; But I just want you to know she&#8217;s got &#8212; I don&#8217;t know, ju- &#8212; you&#8217;re just incredible.&nbsp; I mean &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>THE FIRST LADY:&nbsp; Can&#8217;t wait to see you.<br>&nbsp;<br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; (Laughs.)&nbsp; That’s a fact.&nbsp; We’re probably keeping you too long already.&nbsp; But there&#8217;s about 10 events I&#8217;d like to talk about, but I’ll wait until you get to the White House.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. HIRSHLAND:&nbsp; Well, thank you President Biden and First Lady Dr. Biden.&nbsp; And I&#8217;d love &#8212; I know we have so many of Team USA athletes on the line, but I&#8217;d love to take just a moment and introduce you to &#8212; to three special athletes.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The first is track and field star, and four-time<br>Olympian, Kara Winger, who will serve as our closing ceremony flagbearer, carrying our flag as they march this evening to close the ceremony.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So, Kara, can I ask you &#8212; tell us how it feels to walk with the flag tonight, to know that’s what&#8217;s coming up for you today.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. WINGER:&nbsp;&nbsp; I really &#8212; thank you, Sarah.&nbsp; First of all, happy to be here.&nbsp; I really can&#8217;t even imagine still what it&#8217;s going to be like to walk into that stadium with the flag.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>I&#8217;ve had more disappointment in my career than victory, and to be voted on by this incredible Team USA for this honor is more amazing than I can put into words.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So just incredibly honored, very excited, really amazed that I get to have this closure moment because these teammates voted for me in my last Olympic Games since I&#8217;ve never been on that podium.<br>&nbsp;<br>But I&#8217;m so proud to represent them because it&#8217;s such an honor that they chose me.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; They picked you because of your character, kid.<br>&nbsp;<br>THE FIRST LADY:&nbsp; Yeah.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. WINGER:&nbsp;&nbsp; It&#8217;s &#8212; it&#8217;s wild.&nbsp; It&#8217;s the biggest honor of my life.&nbsp; I&#8217;m so, so proud.&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; Thank you.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. HIRSHLAND:&nbsp; Wow, terrific.&nbsp; Congratulations.&nbsp; And &#8212; and, Mr. President, I can vouch for her character.&nbsp; You&#8217;re exactly right, she&#8217;s an amazing woman.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Let&#8217;s talk about someone else whose character is pretty extraordinary and move to track and field athlete Isaiah Jewett.&nbsp; Isaiah caught our attention from his act of sportsmanship after being tripped in the qualifying round of his 800-meter heat.&nbsp; His moment of kindness is one we will all remember.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Isaiah, can you take us through a little bit about what happened?<br>&nbsp;<br>MR. JEWETT:&nbsp; Hi, yes, of course.&nbsp; First, I would love to &#8212; I just want to address &#8212; love you guys.&nbsp; Big fan &#8212; love what you&#8217;re doing.&nbsp; I&#8217;d love to come to the White House too.&nbsp; Just want to throw that out there.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>But &#8212; (laughter) &#8212; in the &#8212; in terms of the race: I don&#8217;t know, I was really feeling pretty good about the race and how I was executing, and I felt like I was really into the zone.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And then, as soon as I came into the turn, I felt a knee hit my foot, and it made me trip over my leg.&nbsp; And then, when I tried to recover, I felt another foot hit me again.&nbsp; And I knew, like, as soon as I got onto the ground, like my dreams of getting to the final and placing were done.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And I felt kind of hurt for a second while I was laying down.&nbsp; And I actually looked at the other runner, and I saw how defeated he looked.&nbsp; And, for some reason, I just felt like, “In some way, I want to help out.&nbsp; In some way, like, this is &#8212; this is bigger than me.&nbsp; Like, I know that he&#8217;s been here a couple of times, and this is probably a couple of his last ones.”&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>But I just wanted to do whatever I could to say, like, “Hey, man, it&#8217;s okay.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s &#8212; let&#8217;s finish this race together.”&nbsp; Like, I wanted to be some type of hero and show that, you know &#8212; just some good sportsmanship at the end of the day, because I felt like that&#8217;s what&#8217;s important &#8212; like not dwelling on these thing &#8212; not dwelling on these problems that happen, but finishing what we started and making sure everybody is okay.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Because at the end of the day, we&#8217;re all people and we all go through the same nervousness and we all go through the same pains.&nbsp; So might as well finish what we started and just be happy that we&#8217;re actually here in the moment because not a lot of people made it here.<br>&nbsp;<br>So, I was just so happy in the fact that I was able to be a hero to a lot of people and even just be at the Olympic Games.&nbsp; It&#8217;s just such a blessing, even to be here talking to you guys.&nbsp; It&#8217;s just such a blessing meeting all you guys.&nbsp; And sorry if I&#8217;m rambling on.&nbsp; It&#8217;s just so crazy being in the present &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Come on.<br>&nbsp;<br>MR. JEWETT:&nbsp; &#8212; in the present moment of, like,<br>this Olympics, like just seeing different people and competing and being noticed.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s what I really loved about being heard and being shown, like, your true character.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Isaiah, let me say something.<br>&nbsp;<br>THE FIRST LADY:&nbsp; He&#8217;s our &#8212; you are our hero.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; And, by the way, Isaiah &#8212; all kidding aside &#8212; America, when it leads the world leads not by the example of our power, but by the power of our example.&nbsp; That&#8217;s the God&#8217;s truth, and you are an epitome of that.&nbsp; And we thank you for it.&nbsp;&nbsp; We thank you for it.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>MR. JEWETT:&nbsp; (Inaudible.)<br>&nbsp;<br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; On the power of our example.&nbsp; I really mean it.&nbsp; It had profound impact around the world.&nbsp; It really did.<br>&nbsp;<br>Thank you.<br>&nbsp;<br>MR. JEWETT:&nbsp; Thank you.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. HIRSHLAND:&nbsp; Speaking of profound impact, our last athlete really needs no introduction.&nbsp; Simone Biles exemplifies what it means to be a true Olympic champion.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>We have been blown away by Simone&#8217;s accomplishments in the gym, and are now forever inspired and grateful to her for prioritizing mental health and wellbeing, and continuing to serve as a role model for Team USA and for the country.<br>&nbsp;<br>Simone, thank you for being here.&nbsp; How does it feel to be home?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. BILES:&nbsp; Yes, hi.&nbsp; It feels amazing to be home.&nbsp; It&#8217;s been a long journey.&nbsp; The Olympics was not how I expected it to go, but putting my mental and my physical health first will probably be one of my greatest accomplishments.<br>&nbsp;<br>If you would’ve asked me in my younger years, I would have probably been too stubborn.&nbsp; But at that point, I knew that I just had to take a step back, let the other girls go up and do their job.&nbsp; And I&#8217;m very proud of the way they handled everything, especially last minute with me having to step back.<br>&nbsp;<br>But to have mental health be talked about more in sports is really nice because, at the end of the day, we are humans before athletes.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So, it is nice to be back home, though, yes.<br>&nbsp;<br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Well, you’ve set an example.&nbsp; I really mean it, Simone.&nbsp; I mean &#8212; you know, one of the things that Mrs. Biden &#8212; Jill and I have worked on is we work with a lot of soldiers who are coming home with post-traumatic stress.&nbsp; And they&#8217;re like you athletes.&nbsp; They&#8217;re &#8212; you &#8212; you never say no, you never give up, you never say you can&#8217;t do it, you just keep going.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. BILES:&nbsp; Right.<br>&nbsp;<br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; But &#8212; and so for &#8212; for a military person to say “I need help” is incredibly, incredibly difficult, but it shouldn&#8217;t be.&nbsp; It&#8217;s just &#8212; it’s &#8212; it’s no different than if you broke your finger or broke your arm or had a physical injury.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And you&#8217;re one of the greatest athletes in the world.&nbsp; You had the courage &#8212; no, I really mean it.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not &#8212; I&#8217;m not (inaudible).<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. BILES:&nbsp; Thank you.<br>&nbsp;<br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; You had the courage to say, “I need some help.&nbsp; We need some help.&nbsp; I need some time.”&nbsp; And you gave an example to everybody.&nbsp; And guess what?&nbsp; You got back up on that damn beam.&nbsp; And, by the way, you know, what frightens me the most is the beam.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. BILES:&nbsp; Yes.<br>&nbsp;<br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; I &#8212; I always thought I was a pretty good athlete.&nbsp; I was a pretty good baseball and football player, and I &#8212; you know, in high school.&nbsp; My Walter Mitty dream was playing in the pros.&nbsp; You think I&#8217;m kidding.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not.&nbsp; I had to give it up because I &#8212; you know, I become President.&nbsp; What the hell?&nbsp; I settled.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. BILES:&nbsp; (Laughs.)<br>&nbsp;<br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; But all kidding aside &#8212; all kidding aside, it was &#8212; it&#8217;s just amazing to watch you all, and just to watch even those of you who did not get involved in a particularly focused iss- &#8212; you know, dilemma.&nbsp; But just the way you treated one another.&nbsp; Just the way you could see it.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>I guess you knew the cameras were on you in all the events that are watching you get in and out of the pool, on and off the track, on and off the high &#8212; the parallel bar &#8212; the uneven parallel bar.&nbsp; I mean, all of it.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>But I’ll tell you what, doing a flip on a four-inch beam is my idea of going to purgatory.&nbsp; I’ll tell you &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. BILES:&nbsp; (Laughs.)<br>&nbsp;<br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; &#8212; I’ll try almost anything else before I try that.&nbsp; Anyway.<br>&nbsp;<br>THE FIRST LADY:&nbsp; So, you brought us joy, and I think this country has really been through just &#8212; you know, has needed healing.&nbsp; And I think that all the athletes in the games really brought Americans together and brought us joy again.&nbsp; And for that, I thank you.<br>&nbsp;<br>And I have to mention, I love that we have so many moms on the screen, you know, holding their babies.&nbsp; So that&#8217;s so great to see that too, that &#8212; I think there are 10 moms who competed, so good for you.&nbsp; Good for you.<br>&nbsp;<br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; God love you all.<br>&nbsp;<br>David, you could smile, man.&nbsp; It&#8217;s okay.&nbsp; David Hughes, I see you on the &#8212; how come you haven’t smiled yet?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>THE FIRST LADY:&nbsp; (Laughs.)&nbsp; There you go.<br>&nbsp;<br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; There you go.&nbsp; Thank you, man.&nbsp; You&#8217;re a hell of an athlete.&nbsp; You&#8217;re one hell of an athlete.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Anyway, I should get going.&nbsp; I can get myself in trouble here.&nbsp; But I (inaudible) in trouble for things I say, I know.&nbsp; No one ever doubts I mean what I say; the problem is I sometimes say all that I mean.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Well, anyway.&nbsp; But thank you, thank you for the joy, the pride, the hope &#8212; the hope you gave us all.&nbsp; That&#8217;s what you did, you gave people so much hope.&nbsp; Thank you.<br>&nbsp;<br>See you in the White House.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>THE FIRST LADY:&nbsp; See you in the White House.<br>&nbsp;<br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Thanks.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. HIRSHLAND:&nbsp; Thank you so much for being with us.<br>&nbsp;<br>THE FIRST LADY:&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; Thanks, Sarah.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. HIRSHLAND:&nbsp; We&#8217;ll see you soon in the White House.<br>&nbsp;<br>THE FIRST LADY:&nbsp; Yeah.<br>&nbsp;<br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; We’re counting on it.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>6:22 P.M. EDT</p>

<p>Fifty-six years ago today &#8211; surrounded by Democrats and Republicans, activists and leaders including Dr. Martin Luther King, John Lewis, and Rosa Parks &#8211; President Lyndon Baines Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act of 1965 into law. The Voting Rights Act remains one of the most important pieces of legislation in our nation&#8217;s history. It is estimated that in the five years after passage, almost as many Black Americans registered to vote in some southern states as in the 100 years prior to 1965. <br><br>On the anniversary of its signing, we honor the generations of Americans who marched, organized, and sacrificed, and we commit to continuing the fight. Today, voting rights are once again under attack. Over the past decade, the Voting Rights Act has been gutted by Supreme Court decisions. As a result, states have passed anti-voter legislation. Just this year, 18 states have passed 30 laws that make it more difficult for Americans to vote, including by limiting vote-by-mail, early voting, and other restrictive measures. We must fight back, and we are.<br><br>There are two landmark pieces of federal legislation moving through Congress now that our Administration fully supports—the For the People Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. Just as leaders recognized 56 years ago, we are in a critical moment, and that is why we must pass these bills.<br><br>It will not be easy. But the struggle over voting rights has never been easy. Each generation has fought to expand voting rights, and we owe it to the next generation to fight for every American’s right to vote and have their vote counted.</p>
