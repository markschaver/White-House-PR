<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>San Francisco International Airport</em><em><br><em>San Francisco, California</em></em></p>



<p>Q    Two questions for you, to start.</p>



<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; (Inaudible).&nbsp; (Laughs.)</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay, two questions for you.&nbsp; First, do you have any reaction to the latest sanctions from Russia that would bar your entry into the country?</p>



<p>And then, second, on Title 42, would you be in favor of delaying the ending of it, especially as a few members of your own party have kind of pushed back?&nbsp; Is that something that’s under consideration?</p>



<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; So, let’s be very clear about where we stand in terms of Russia: As far as I’m concerned — and I think, objectively, many people will agree — that their invasion of Ukraine has not only been steeped in atrocities but will proof to be a strategic failure for Russia.</p>



<p>What we have done most recently, and the President did a speech this morning talking about what we will continue to do as a — one of our highest commitments to continue to support the Ukrainian people, President Zelenskyy with what we can in terms of economic assistance, humanitarian assistance.&nbsp; But also, with equal fervor, we are absolutely committed to continuing with the serious consequences and costs to Russia of its act of aggression and, as the President has rightly said, with its criminal conduct.</p>



<p>And so that has included what we will continue to do to issue sanctions, as we just announced, but all with an understanding that one of our highest priorities is sovereignty and territorial integrity as a — is solid principle that binds and unifies the NATO Alliance, to your point about NATO.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so we’re going to continue to do that work, and we’re not going to give up.</p>



<p>Thank you. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; END</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>Today, the U.S. Department of Energy announced that it has awarded contracts for <em>all </em>of the initial 30 million barrels it put up for sale as part of President Biden’s historic Strategic Petroleum Reserve Release. These barrels will be delivered in May and June, and are the first U.S. sale in the largest release from reserves from both the United States and the rest of the world in history. Together, these releases will put more than one million barrels per day on the market over the next six months, and will help address supply disruptions caused by Putin’s further invasion of Ukraine and the Price Hike that Americans are facing at the pump.</p>



<p>The initial sale of barrels from the release garnered strong interest and was substantially oversubscribed: DOE received bids for a total of 76 million barrels, or more than doublethe number of barrels put up for sale.</p>



<p>The Biden Administration also announced this week a set of <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/04/20/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-creates-cost-saving-clean-energy-opportunities-to-combat-climate-crisis/">new actions and programs</a> this week that support the President’s mission to accelerate America’s move towards true energy independence and lowering costs for Americans with a clean energy economy.</p>



<p>With these announcement, President Biden is demonstrating both his unwavering commitment to doing everything in his power to ease the pain American families are facing today at the pump as a result of Putin’s Price Hike, while continuing to take strong action – right now and without delay – to achieve lasting American energy independence.</p>



<p><strong><u>Actions to Immediately Increase Supply and Lower Prices at the Pump</u></strong></p>



<p><strong>Largest-Ever Release of Oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. </strong>President Biden announced the largest-ever release of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserves, which will put one million additional barrels on the market per day on average—every day—for the next six months. The release will provide a record amount of supply to the market until the end of the year, when domestic production is expected to increase by 1 million barrels per day. DOE will use the revenue from the release to restock the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in future years. This will provide a signal of future demand and help encourage domestic production today, and will ensure the continued readiness of the Reserve to respond to future emergencies.</p>



<p><strong>Historic Collective Release of Oil from the International Energy Agency</strong>. After around the clock diplomacy by the President and allies and partners, the International Energy Agency announced an unprecedented collective release with member countries outside the United States releasing an additional 60 million barrels. Together with the United States’ commitment, this will add a combined global amount of 240 million barrels to the market. It is the largest release from other IEA countries in history, and will support American consumers and the global economy.</p>



<p><strong>Expanding Americans’ Access to Affordable Fuel Options This Summer. </strong>President Biden announced that the EPA Administrator is planning to issue an emergency waiver allowing E15 gasoline—gasoline that uses a 15 percent ethanol blend—to be sold this summer. An emergency waiver can help increase fuel supplies, give consumers more choice to get lower prices, and provide savings to many families. At current prices, E15 can save a family 10 cents per gallon of gas on average, and many stores sell E15 at an even greater discount – adding up to real savings for working families. Allowing higher levels of blending will also reduce our dependency on foreign fuels as we rely more heavily on home-grown biofuels.</p>



<p><strong>Increasing Domestic Production Through a “Use it or Lose it” Policy. </strong>The United States is already approaching record levels of oil and natural gas production, with domestic production expected to increase by 1 million barrels per day this year and over 500,000 barrels per day next year. But too many companies aren’t doing their part and are choosing to make extraordinary profits and without investing to help with supply. Right now, the oil and gas industry is sitting on more than 12 million acres of non-producing Federal land with 9,000 unused but approved permits for drilling. President Biden called on Congress to make companies pay fees on idled wells and non-producing acres on Federal lands – so that companies that continue to sit on excess capacity will have to choose whether to start producing or pay a fee.</p>



<p><strong><u>Achieving Real Energy Independence and Lowering Costs for Families</u></strong></p>



<p>The President knows the true path to energy security runs through clean energy. This week, the Biden Administration announced <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/04/20/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-creates-cost-saving-clean-energy-opportunities-to-combat-climate-crisis/">new actions and programs</a> that accelerate and strengthen America’s move towards a clean energy economy and lower costs for consumers, furthering the path towards true U.S. energy independence. These actions build on the steps President Biden has taken this year to reduce energy costs for families: expanding clean energy, making clean energy more affordable and accessible, and increasing energy efficiency.</p>



<p><strong>Expanding Clean Energy</strong><strong></strong></p>



<ul><li>The Department of the Interior outlined a <a href="https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/interior-department-outlines-roadmap-continued-renewable-energy-progress-public-lands">roadmap</a> this week to reach the President’s target to double clean energy permits on public lands, reaching 25 gigawatts of renewable power by 2025.</li></ul>



<ul><li>The Department of Energy established a new <a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/president-biden-department-energy-establish-bipartisan-infrastructure-laws-20-million">rebate program</a> this week through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to provide utilities with the resources to upgrade critical equipment that supports a cleaner and more efficient power grid.</li></ul>



<ul><li>President Biden launched the American offshore wind industry through the Department of the Interior, approving the first large-scale projects, identifying new wind energy areas in the Atlantic and the Pacific, and holding a record-breaking $4.3 billion lease sale, putting us on track to meet his target of 30 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2030.</li></ul>



<ul><li>The Department of Energy fast-tracked clean energy projects by approving record levels of solar and other renewables on public lands and helping local governments advance community solar projects.</li></ul>



<ul><li>The Department of Energy advanced power grid upgrades to increase reliability, lower costs, and unlock more clean energy through the <a href="https://www.energy.gov/oe/articles/building-better-grid-initiative">Building a Better Grid Initiative</a>.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Making Clean Energy More Affordable and Accessible</strong></p>



<ul><li>The Department of Energy deployed a software tool – SolarAPP+ – to cut permitting times for residential solar to less than one day, helping to fast-track families’ access to cheaper, cleaner, and more secure energy.</li></ul>



<ul><li>The Department of Agriculture a new pilot program to help people in underserved rural communities cut energy costs via renewable energy, building on more than $450 million in investments in renewable energy fur rural communities last year.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Increase Energy Efficiency</strong></p>



<ul><li>The Biden Administration is advancing a series of <a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/doe-releases-energy-saving-rules-federal-buildings-and-proposes-new-standards-consumer">100 actions</a> to be completed this year, which together will save families $100 every year with more efficient home appliances and equipment.</li></ul>



<ul><li>The Department of Energy <a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/biden-administration-announces-investments-make-homes-more-energy-efficient-and-lower">opened applications</a> for more than $3 billion in new Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding—ten times the historical funding levels—for the Weatherization Assistance Program, providing energy efficiency and electrification upgrades in homes and saving families on their utility bills.</li></ul>



<ul><li>The Department of Transportation’s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration finalized <a href="https://www.transportation.gov/briefing-room/usdot-announces-new-vehicle-fuel-economy-standards-model-year-2024-2026">standards</a> for cars and trucks that will allow drivers to travel further on every gallon of fuel and save money at the pump.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Vice President Harris announced the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/04/04/fact-sheet-the-biden-harris-action-plan-for-building-better-school-infrastructure/">Biden-Harris Action Plan to Build Better School Infrastructure</a>, including a $500 million grant program at the Department of Energy to save schools money by tackling energy costs—the second-largest expense after teacher salaries.</li></ul>



<ul><li>The White House joined leaders from state and city governments, labor, and industry to launch the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/01/21/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-launches-coalition-of-states-and-local-governments-to-strengthen-building-performance-standards/">Building Performance Standards Coalition</a>, a first-of-its-kind partnership between more than 30 state and local governments covering nearly 20% of the nation’s building footprint, dedicated to deliver cleaner, healthier buildings with lower energy bills.</li></ul>

<p>President Biden is using all the tools at his disposal to address Putin’s Price Hike at the pump. Today, the Department of Energy announced that it has awarded contracts for <em>all </em>of the initial thirty million barrels it put up for sale as part of the emergency release of 1 million barrels per day in oil for the next 6 months. This is an important step to addressing the supply shortage and the Putin Price Hike Americans are facing. These sales will continue. And because of round-the-clock diplomatic efforts, our partners and Allies have committed to releasing an additional 60 million barrels. </p>



<p>This is just the latest result of the Biden Administration’s efforts to do everything in our power to lower energy costs for American families, including accelerating the deployment of cost-saving clean energy with the urgency this moment requires. Last week, the President announced that his Administration is planning to allow the sale of E15 gasoline in all parts of the country this summer, so that Americans have access to more choices and lower prices. And the Administration continues to work toward <em>real </em>energy independence by rapidly reducing our dependence on oil—including this week’s announcement of critical investments to deploy clean energy.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Fifty-two years ago, millions of people gathered across our&nbsp;country in a rally to protect our planet.&nbsp;&nbsp;This collective action gave birth to a new movement and spurred the creation of landmark environmental laws that protect the air we breathe and the water we drink.&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, we must recapture that spirit and, as I said in my Inaugural Address, heed&nbsp;a cry for survival that comes from the planet itself.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In their most recent report, the Intergovernmental Panel on&nbsp;Climate Change provided yet another round of evidence that climate change is no longer in the distant future &#8212; it is here.&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, extreme weather and climate disasters cost our communities $145 billion and claimed hundreds of lives.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the summer of 2021 alone, nearly 1 out of every 3 Americans experienced a weather disaster.&nbsp;&nbsp;The climate crisis is upending lives across the country and around the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;Environmental injustices continue to exact a toll on&nbsp;the health of communities of color, low-income communities, and&nbsp;Tribal and Indigenous communities.&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of wildlife species in the United States and around the world are facing an&nbsp;extinction crisis unparalleled in human history.&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;environmental challenges of our time call for historic action, and we intend to meet the moment.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why my Administration has launched the most ambitious environmental and climate agenda in history.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have made the bold&nbsp;commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the United States by 50 to 52 percent by 2030, reach 100 percent carbon pollution-free electricity by 2035, and achieve net zero emissions economy-wide by no later than 2050.&nbsp;&nbsp;To work toward these goals, we have taken action across every sector of the economy, including setting the strongest-ever standards for greenhouse gas emissions from passenger vehicles, tackling super-pollutants like methane and hydrofluorocarbons, investing billions in the deployment of clean technologies, and launching the American offshore wind industry.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, I was proud to start the &#8220;America the Beautiful&#8221; initiative, our first-ever voluntary national conservation goal to conserve 30 percent of America&#8217;s lands and waters by&nbsp;2030.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to build on these actions and accelerate our Nation&#8217;s ability to confront the environmental and climate challenges we face.&nbsp;&nbsp;It will allow us to remediate and reclaim abandoned mine lands and oil wells leaking methane while putting Americans to work in good paying jobs; invest in coastal wetlands and habitats that can protect infrastructure and homes during storms; replace lead pipes that plague underserved communities and remove dangerous chemicals from our drinking water; restore watersheds and rivers; create fish passage to protect iconic species, such as salmon;&nbsp;restore forests as carbon sinks; build resilience to climate impacts including droughts, heat, floods, and wildfires; and build a national network of electric vehicle charging stations to accelerate our transition to electric mobility.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As my Administration implements this agenda, we are following through on our commitment to ensuring that our investments advance equity and justice and reach communities across the country &#8212; including rural communities, communities of color, and low-income communities.&nbsp;&nbsp;We will be guided by the steadfast conviction of Earth Day founder Gaylord Nelson, my friend and former colleague, that &#8220;every person has the inalienable right to a decent environment,&#8221; including those who&nbsp;have long been shut out of decisions that directly affect&nbsp;their lives and who are most likely to bear the brunt of pollution and climate change.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The responsibility to confront the climate crisis is not solely on the United States.&nbsp;&nbsp;It requires leaders across the world committing to a clean energy future.&nbsp;&nbsp;On my first day in office, I fulfilled my promise to rejoin our Nation to the Paris Agreement to tackle the climate crisis at home and abroad.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the future of our planet, for our health, and for our children and grandchildren, we must act now.&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us stand united in this effort to save our planet and, in the process, strengthen our economy and grow more connected to each other and&nbsp;the world we share.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 22, 2022, as Earth Day.&nbsp;&nbsp;I encourage all Americans to participate in programs and activities that will deepen their understanding of environmental protection, the urgency of climate change, and the need to create a healthier, safer, more equitable future for all people.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this&nbsp;twenty-first day of April, in the year of our Lord two&nbsp;thousand&nbsp;twenty-two, and of the Independence of the United&nbsp;States of&nbsp;America the two&nbsp;hundred and forty-sixth.</p>

<p>Jill and I believe that our nation has a sacred obligation to America’s veterans and their families. Among other things, this means providing veterans with the tools and resources for economic opportunity, security, and dignity. My Administration’s approach is working: today, the unemployment rate for veterans is 2.4 percent—tied for the lowest rate on record—and down from an average of 6.5 percent in 2020.</p>



<p>Veterans of all backgrounds are finally being cut in on the deal. Unemployment rates for white, Black, Asian, and Hispanic veterans—male and female—fell and were the same or lower than their nonveteran counterparts in 2021. And, the unemployment rate for veterans with a service-connected disability declined to 3.4 percent.</p>



<p>This historic progress is the result of my Administration’s efforts to rebuild America’s economy from the bottom up and the middle out. We are continuing to build on this record with initiatives to bring veterans into critical industries like trucking and ensure they are good-paying, quality jobs. And, we are continuing our work to reduce the costs veterans and working families face.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Roosevelt Room</p>



<p>10:01 A.M. EDT</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp;&nbsp;Good morning, everyone.&nbsp; Sorry to keep you waiting a little bit.&nbsp; I had the honor of spending some time with the Ukrainian Prime Minister, who’s in town today.&nbsp; And he is meeting with some of my Cabinet members, including the Secretary of Treasury and others.&nbsp;<br><br>And we had a &#8212; a good discussion.&nbsp; I talked about what I’m about to tell you about today, as well as &#8212; he was thanking the American people for their support, understands it’s significant, and was &#8212; we talked about keeping everyone together, in terms of Europe, the European Union, and others, in the effort to stop Putin’s brutality.&nbsp;<br><br>But before I head out to the West Coast, I want to quickly update the American people on the latest steps we’re taking to support the people of Ukraine and to hold Putin accountable for his brutal and bloody war.&nbsp;<br><br>Russian forces have retreated from Kyiv, leaving behind them a horrifying evidence.&nbsp; And you’ve seen it and you reported it &#8212; your folks.&nbsp; And, by the way, I &#8212; I don&#8217;t say this often, but I think we should give enormous credit to the folks in your agencies that are on the ground in Ukraine, in these spots.&nbsp; And they&#8217;re &#8212; they&#8217;re really &#8212; I&#8217;ve spoken to several of them.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a &#8212; we owe them.&nbsp; But uncovering these evidences of their atrocities and war crimes against the Ukrainian people &#8212; it’s so clear to the whole world now.<br><br>Now they’ve launched and refocused their campaign to seize new territory in eastern Ukraine.<br><br>And we’re in a critical window now of time where that &#8212; they’re going to set the stage for the next phase of this war.<br><br>And the United States and our Allies and partners are moving as fast as possible to continue to provide Ukraine the forces that they need &#8212; the weapons they need &#8212; excuse me &#8212; and the equipment they need &#8212; their forces need to defend their nation.<br><br>Last week, I signed an $800 million package of security assistance to Ukraine that included new capabilities like artillery systems and armored personnel carriers &#8212; equipment that is responsive to Ukraine’s needs and tailored to support the intensified fighting in the Donbas region, which is a different war than in other places because both &#8212; topographically it’s different.&nbsp; It’s flat, it’s not in the mountains, and it requires different kinds of weapons to be more effective.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Today, I’m announcing another $800 million to further augment Ukraine’s ability to fight in the east &#8212; in the Donbas region.<br><br>This package includes heavy artillery weapons &#8212; dozens of Howitzers &#8212; and 144,000 rounds of ammunition to go with those Howitzers.&nbsp; It also includes more tactical drones.<br><br>In the past two months, we’ve moved weapons and equipment to Ukraine at record speed.<br><br>We’ve sent thousands of anti-armor and anti-[air] missile[s], helicopters, drones, grenade launchers, machine guns, rifles, radar systems.&nbsp;More than 50 million rounds of ammunition had already been sent.&nbsp;<br><br>The United States alone has provided 10 anti-armor systems for every one Russian tank that’s in Ukraine &#8212; a 10 to 1 ratio.<br><br>We’re sharing and will continue to share significant, timely intelligence with Ukraine to help defend them against Russian aggression.<br><br>And on top of this, these direct contributions from the United States, we’re facilitating; we’re the outfit facilitating the significant flow of weapons and systems to Ukraine from other Allies and partners around the world, like the S-300 long-range, anti-aircraft systems that Slovakia recently transferred to Ukraine.&nbsp; We are getting them in there.&nbsp;<br><br>We won’t always be able to advertise everything we &#8212; that our partners are doing to support Ukraine in its fight for freedom.&nbsp;<br><br>But to modernize Teddy Roosevelt’s famous advice: Sometimes we will speak softly and carry a large Javelin.&nbsp; Because we’re sending a lot of those in as well.&nbsp;<br><br>You know, but we’re not &#8212; we’re not sitting on the funding that Congress has provided for Ukraine.&nbsp; We’re sending it directly to the frontlines of freedom, to the fearless and skilled Ukrainian fighters who are standing in the breach.<br><br>You got to admit, you have &#8212; must be amazed at the courage of this country, the resolve that they’re showing, not just the milit- &#8212; their military, but the average citizen: men and women, young &#8212; young men, young women as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>It’s &#8212; you know, the sustained and coordinated support of the international community, led and facilitated by the United States, has a &#8212; is a significant reason why Ukraine is able to stop Russia from taking over their country thus far.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Every American taxpayer, every member of our Armed Forces can be proud of the fact that our country’s generosity and the skill and service of our military helped arm and repel Russia’s aggression in Ukraine, to beat back Putin’s savagery that tried to seize Ukraine’s capital and wipe out Ukraine’s government.<br><br>The Battle of Kyiv was a historic victory for the Ukrainians.&nbsp; It was a victory for freedom, won by the Ukrainian people with unprecedented assistance by the United States and our Allies and our partners.&nbsp;<br><br>Now &#8212; now we have to accelerate that assistance package to help prepare Ukraine for Russia’s offensive that’s going to be more limited in terms of geography, but not in terms of brutality &#8212; not in terms of brutality.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Combined with our recent drawdowns, it will ensure a steady flow of weapons and equipment into Ukraine over the next few weeks.<br><br>However, with this latest disbursement, I’ve almost exhausted the drawdown authority I have that Congress authorized for Ukraine in a bipartisan spending bill last month.<br><br>In order to sustain Ukraine for the duration of this fight, next week I’m going to &#8212; have to be sending to Congress a supplemental budget request to keep weapons and ammunition flowing without interruption to the brave Ukrainian fighters and to continue to deliver economic assistance to the Ukrainian people.<br><br>Hope &#8212; and my hope is and my expectation is Congress would move and act quickly.&nbsp; And I want to thank the Congress &#8212; Democrats and Republicans &#8212; for their support for the people of Ukraine.<br><br>Our unity at home, our unity with our Allies and partners, and our unity with the Ukrainian people is sending an unmistakable message to Putin: He will never succeed in dominating and occupying all of Ukraine.&nbsp; He will not &#8212; that will not happen.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>In addition to bolstering Ukraine’s resistance on the battlefield, we’re also demonstrating our support for the people of Ukraine.<br><br>Today, the United States is announcing that we intend to provide an additional $500 million in direct economic assistance to the Ukrainian government.<br><br>This brings our total economic support for Ukraine to $1 billion in the past two months.<br><br>This is money the government can help use to help stabilize their economy, to support communities that have been devastated by the Russian onslaught, and pay the brave workers that continue to provide essential services to the people of Ukraine.&nbsp;<br><br>You know, these past weeks have seen a terrible human cost of Putin’s ambition for conquest and control.&nbsp; Approximately two thirds &#8212; two thirds &#8212; of all Ukrainian children have been displaced from their homes.&nbsp; More than 5 million Ukrainians have fled their country.&nbsp; It’s an absolute outrage.&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea this is happening approaching the second quarter of the 21st century is just &#8212; (sighs).<br><br>Last month, when I was in Europe, I announced that the United States would welcome 100,000 Ukrainians so that we share in the responsibility of supporting Ukrainians fleeing Putin’s war machine.<br><br>We’ve already welcomed tens of thousands of Ukrainians to the United States.<br><br>And today, I’m announcing a program, “Unite for Ukraine” &#8212; a new program to enable Ukrainians seeking refuge to come directly from Europe to the United States.<br><br>This new humanitarian parole program will complement the existing legal pathways available to Ukrainians, including immigrant visas and refugee processing.<br><br>It will provide an expedient channel for secure, legal migration from Europe to the United States for Ukrainians who have a U.S. sponsor, such as a family or an NGO.<br><br>This program will be fast.&nbsp; It will be streamlined.&nbsp; And it will ensure the United States honors its commitment to go to the Ukrainian people and need not go through our southern border.<br><br>We’re also continuing to ratchet up the pressure on Putin and further isolate Russia on the world stage.<br><br>Yesterday, the Treasury Department rolled out additional measures to crack down on the entities and individuals attempting to evade our unprecedented sanctions &#8212; not just ours, but throughout the West.<br><br>Today, I’m announcing that the United States will ban Russian-affiliated ships from our ports, as they did in Europe.<br><br>That means no ship &#8212; no ship that sails under the Russian flag or that is owned or operated by Russian interests will be allowed to dock in a United States port or access our shores.&nbsp; None.&nbsp; None.<br><br>This is yet another critical step we’re taking in concert with our partners in the European Union, the United Kingdom, and Canada and &#8212; further to deny Russia the benefits of the international economic system that they so enjoyed in the past.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>We don’t know how long this war will last.&nbsp; But as we approach the two-month mark, here’s what we do know:<br><br>Putin has failed to achieve his grand ambitions on the battlefield.&nbsp; After weeks of shelling Kyiv, Kyiv still stands.<br><br>President Zelenskyy and his democratically elected government still remain in power.<br><br>And the Ukrainian armed forces, joined by many brave Ukrainian civilians, have thwarted Russia’s conquest of their country.<br><br>They have been bolstered from day one by an unstinting supply of weapons, ammunition, armor, intelligence from the nations of the free world led by us, the United States.<br><br>As Russia continues to grind out the military advances and &#8212; their military advances and the brutalities against Ukraine, Putin is banking on us losing interest.&nbsp; That’s been my view; you’ve heard me say this from the beginning.&nbsp; He was counting on NATO, the European Union, our allies in Asia cracking, moving away.&nbsp; He’s betting on Western unity will crack.&nbsp; He’s still betting on that.<br><br>And, once again, we’re going to prove him wrong.&nbsp; We will not lessen our resolve.&nbsp; We’re going to continue to stand with the brave and proud people of Ukraine.&nbsp; We will never fail in our determination to defend freedom and oppose tyranny.&nbsp; It’s as simple as that.<br><br>So, again, I want to thank the American people &#8212; thank the American people for their support of the Ukrainian people.&nbsp; This is our &#8212; this is our responsibility, it seems to me, and we’ve been able to hold the whole world together in this effort.&nbsp;<br><br>So, thank you very much.&nbsp; Thank you.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. President &#8212;<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; I’m going to take just one or two questions.&nbsp; I’ve got a plane to catch.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What does &#8212; what does Putin claiming control over Mariupol mean?&nbsp; Is that &#8212; how significant is that?<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Well, first of all, it’s questionable whether he does control Mariupol.&nbsp; One thing for sure we know about Mariupol: He should allow humanitarian corridors to let people on that steel mill and other places that are buried under rubble to get out &#8212; to get out.&nbsp; That’s what any, any, any head of state would do in such a circumstance.<br><br>And so, there is no evidence yet that Mariupol has completely fallen.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. President, on Title 42, sir, are you considering delaying lifting Title 42?<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; No.&nbsp; What I’m considering is continuing to hear from my &#8212; my &#8212;<br><br>Well, first of all, there’s going to be an appeal by the Justice Department because, as a matter of principle, we want to be able to be in a position where if, in fact, it is strongly concluded by the scientists that we need Title 42, that we be able to do that.<br><br>But there has been no decision on extending Title 42.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. President, how long can the U.S. maintain the level and pace of this military support for Ukraine?<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; I &#8212; well, we have the capacity to do this for a long time.&nbsp; The question is: Are we going to continue to maintain the support of the international community and keep the pressure on Putin to prevent him from overrunning the country?&nbsp; Number one.&nbsp; And, number two, make sure we continue to maintain the economic sanctions, which, over time &#8212; and we’re beginning to see it &#8212; are devastating their economy and their ability to move forward.<br><br>So, the most important thing right now is maintain the unity.&nbsp; So far, so good.<br><br>Thank you very much.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How much money are you going to ask for in the supplemental?&nbsp; How much money in the supplemental, sir?<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; The answer &#8212; that’s being decided now.&nbsp; And I’m asking the Defense Department to put together what they think we need.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>10:14 A.M. EDT</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Total Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program Funding Reaches Record $8.3 Billion for Hard-Pressed American Families in Fiscal Year 2022</em></p>



<p>Today, the White House is announcing that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) will release more than $385 million to states to help families and individuals with their home energy costs – including summer cooling – through the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP). These funds are in addition to the $4.5 billion that the American Rescue Plan provided to LIHEAP and the<a href="https://www.acf.hhs.gov/media/press/2022/president-bidens-bipartisan-infrastructure-law-directs-100-million-lower-heating"> first $100 million installment</a>&nbsp;of a five-year, $500 million investment in LIHEAP from President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Altogether, this year the Biden-Harris Administration is providing more than $8.3 billion in LIHEAP assistance to reduce heating and cooling costs for low-income Americans – the largest investment in a single year since the program was established in 1981.</p>



<p>The President is traveling today to the Pacific Northwest, which saw record heat last year, where he will highlight actions he has taken to help lower costs for families, including home energy costs. These actions include:</p>



<p><strong>Record LIHEAP Funding for States:</strong> Today, HHS announced the expected final state-by-state allocation of over $8.3 billion in LIHEAP funding outlined below. For example, Oregon, where the President is traveling today, will receive an additional $3.8 million, bringing the total for Oregon – including American Rescue Plan funds – to $92.6 million in LIHEAP funding. Washington, where the President will travel tomorrow, will receive an additional $6.5 million, bringing its total to $151.2 million.</p>



<p><strong>The American Rescue Plan’s Historic Resources and Relief for Homeowners:</strong>&nbsp;The American Rescue Plan provided other critical resources that states and localities can use to address home energy costs. This includes Emergency Rental Assistance (ERA) programs, which received an additional $21.5 billion in funding from the American Rescue Plan, can provide help with past-due utility bills or ongoing assistance with energy costs to help distressed renters avoid shut-offs and keep current on expenses. Over $30 billion of ERA funds have been obligated to assist households with rent and utility costs. The Treasury Department is also working with states and tribes to distribute $9.8&nbsp;billion in funding for the Homeowners Assistance Fund, with a majority of approved plans&nbsp;including&nbsp;utility assistance to homeowners in need. State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds can also be deployed to help deliver energy relief to families. Jurisdictions – such as California; Maryland; Louisville, Kentucky; Mesa, Arizona; Burlington, Vermont; and the Menominee Tribe of Wisconsin – are already helping households eliminate unpaid bills, avoid shut-offs, and reduce their energy bills.</p>



<p><strong>The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law’s Historic Investments to Reduce Home Energy Costs:</strong>&nbsp;The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invested a historic <a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/biden-administration-announces-investments-make-homes-more-energy-efficient-and-lower">$3.5 billion in the Department of Energy’s Weatherization Assistance Program</a>, reducing energy costs for hundreds of thousands of low-income households by increasing their homes’ energy efficiency.</p>



<p><strong>Saving Families Money with Energy Efficiency Standards:</strong> The Biden-Harris Administration is continuing a series of 100 actions, to be completed this year, that together will save families $100 every year with more efficient home appliances and equipment. The Department of Energy recently <a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/doe-releases-energy-saving-rules-federal-buildings-and-proposes-new-standards-consumer">proposed new standards</a> for appliances like air conditioners to help consumers save on their utility bills, which is critical as communities cope with increasingly common and extreme heat events. The Administration will continue taking action to make homes, offices, schools, appliances, and more energy efficient to cut costs for consumers.</p>



<p>Today’s announcement also builds on the Administration’s previous actions to ensure these historic resources are distributed swiftly and equitably:</p>



<ul><li><strong><u>Encouraged States to Plan Early:</u></strong>&nbsp;In November 2021, the White House&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/11/18/fact-sheet-biden-administration-deploys-american-rescue-plan-funds-to-protect-americans-from-rising-home-heating-costs-calls-on-utility-companies-to-prevent-shut-offs-this-winter/">called on states, localities, and tribes to plan early</a>&nbsp;to distribute American Rescue Plan funds to address home energy costs.</li><li><strong><u>Secured Commitments from Utilities to Avoid Shut-offs and Expedite Aid:</u></strong>&nbsp;The White House has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/11/18/fact-sheet-biden-administration-deploys-american-rescue-plan-funds-to-protect-americans-from-rising-home-heating-costs-calls-on-utility-companies-to-prevent-shut-offs-this-winter/">called on utility companies</a>&nbsp;to prevent devastating utility shut-offs and help expedite the delivery of unprecedented federal aid.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/01/07/biden-administration-announces-state-by-state-funding-to-address-home-energy-costs/">In January, the White House announced</a> commitments from fourteen major utility companies across the country as well as a delivered fuel trade association.</li><li><strong><u>Called for Coordination of Home Energy Relief to Families:</u></strong>&nbsp;In November 2021, the White House called for coordination across programs to maximize the impact of home energy assistance. HHS and Treasury <a href="https://www.acf.hhs.gov/ocs/policy-guidance/liheap-im-2022-01-liheap-coordination-era-during-winter-fy22">issued guidance</a> and co-hosted webinars on LIHEAP and ERA best practices that attracted 500 administrators from across the country. By December 2021, more than half of these administrators reported that they are coordinating across these programs.</li><li><strong><u>Provided Best Practices on Coordination with Utility Providers:</u></strong>&nbsp;In January, HHS and Treasury hosted a webinar <a href="https://www.acf.hhs.gov/ocs/policy-guidance/liheap-dcl-2022-04-additional-training-opportunities-guidance-emergency-rental">with over 700 utility assistance program administrators and utility providers</a> from across the country to discuss how programs including LIHEAP and ERA can coordinate with utility providers to increase the efficiency and reach of their programs.</li><li><strong><u>Conducted Outreach and Celebrated National Energy Assistance Day:</u></strong>&nbsp;To celebrate the inaugural National Energy Assistance Day on February 1, HHS released a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.acf.hhs.gov/ocs/podcast/liheap-celebrates-national-energy-assistance-day-2022-audio-news-release">radio announcement in English</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.acf.hhs.gov/ocs/podcast/liheap-celebrates-national-energy-assistance-day-2022-spanish">Spanish</a>&nbsp;and a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XebYS0OEm0">video</a>&nbsp;to encourage families to apply for LIHEAP. The radio announcement aired over 5,000 times and reached more than 80 million listeners. HHS also <a href="https://www.acf.hhs.gov/ocs/policy-guidance/liheap-dcl-2022-06-national-energy-assistance-day-fy2022">encouraged LIHEAP Administrators to participate</a> in National Energy Assistance Day. Agencies across the Administration and the White House disseminated information about assistance programs and coordinated outreach.</li><li><strong><u>Released Brief on Using Pandemic Emergency Assistance Fund for Utility Assistance:</u></strong>&nbsp;The American Rescue Plan provided $1 billion for states, territories and tribes to distribute cash or targeted assistance to needy families. In February, HHS&nbsp;<a href="https://www.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/documents/ofa/peaf_energy_security_brief_1_27_2022_508.pdf">released a brief</a>&nbsp;on how to use these funds for utility needs.</li></ul>
