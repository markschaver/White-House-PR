<p class="has-text-align-center">James S. Brady Press Briefing Room</p>



<p>3:00 P.M. EDT<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Hi, everyone.&nbsp; Hello.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Welcome back, Jen.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Well, thank you.&nbsp; I know it’s a later briefing this afternoon.&nbsp; Good things are worth the wait.<br><br>And with that, we are &#8212; I’m pleased to be joined today by Gene Sperling, who probably doesn’t need a great introduction as the former NEC Director in two administrations and the person who’s overseeing our American Rescue Plan implementation.&nbsp; He’s going to talk a little bit about where we are on housing, take a few questions, and then we will proceed with our normal series of events.<br><br>With that, go ahead, Gene.<br><br>MR. SPERLING:&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; It’s good to be back.<br><br>You know, our President so deeply believes that every avoidable eviction of an American family hurt by this pandemic is an avoidable heartbreak and harm to a family’s economic security and dignity.&nbsp; And he has worked and instructed us, from day one, to do everything within our power to prevent unnecessary evictions for those who have been hurt through this pandemic.<br><br>What I wanted to do today is just give you a little background on the statement that is coming out today that deals with both evictions, our executive actions, and the emerge- &#8212; Emergency Rental Assistance Plan for state and local governments.<br><br>On evictions: The President has long fought for an eviction moratorium.&nbsp; He actually proposed extending the eviction moratorium until September 30th when he came into office, and I believe that was not possible due to reconciliation rules.&nbsp; But that was his initial policy position he put forward.<br><br>He has also supported the CDC extending the CD- &#8212; their eviction moratorium &#8212; first from June 20th to May 31st, then from May 31st until June 30th.&nbsp; And then, even when there was legal questions and legal risk, he supported them extending it through July 31st.&nbsp;<br><br>Unfortunately, the Supreme Court declared on June 29th that the CDC could not grant such an extension without clear and specific congressional authorization.&nbsp; But given the rising urgency of the spread of the Delta variant, the President has asked all of us, including the CDC, to do everything in our power to look for every potential legal authority we can have to prevent evictions.&nbsp;<br><br>To date, the CDC Director and her team have been unable to find legal authority, even for a more targeted eviction moratorium that would focus just on counties with higher rates of COVID spread.&nbsp;<br><br>But again, the President’s focus is for us to do everything within our power &#8212; or, I should say, everything within anyone&#8217;s power &#8212; to help prevent unnecessary, avoidable, and painful evictions.&nbsp;<br><br>One of the things that is &#8212; that he is requesting today is that state and local governments extend or pass eviction moratoriums to cover the next two months.&nbsp; Right now, one out of three renters who are behind in the rent are actually protected beyond the federal eviction moratorium by extended state and local evictions moratoriums.&nbsp; The President is asking that all governors and mayors follow suit and extend moratoriums for up to &#8212; for not “up to,” but for two months.<br><br>Two, this President is asking that his departments that provide mortgage-backed lending extend whatever eviction moratoriums they have the power to extend.&nbsp; So that covers USDA and VA and HUD.&nbsp;<br><br>Third, we have already announced that those with federally backed mortgages may not evict without 30 days of notice.&nbsp; But today, the President is going further in his statement Friday and in &#8212; by the Cabinet members.&nbsp; And in his instruction today,&nbsp;he is asking that USDA, VA, and HUD, and the Treasury Department as well make clear that those who benefit from government-backed mortgages or even tax relief related to housing should not seek evictions without first seeking the Emergency Rental Assistance funding that allows &#8212; that makes landlords completely whole; that can pay up to 18 months of forward and back rent and utilities &#8212; that we want anybody who&#8217;s got a government-backed mortgage to seek that type of relief.&nbsp;<br><br>Finally, as the congressional leadership discussed and asked, we are going to do an all-agency review to make sure that we understand any potential reason why state and local governments are not getting funds out and making sure that we are using all authorities &#8212; whatever federal authority that we have &#8212; to prevent evictions.&nbsp;<br><br>On the state and local relief, as you know, there was $25 billion in initial Emergency Rental Assistance.&nbsp; Again, this is the rental assistance that goes &#8212; can make landlords completely whole and also keep families safely housed.&nbsp; It is a win-win solution.&nbsp;<br><br>Unfortunately, on January 19th, the Trump administration left by putting in place a completely unworkable, high-documented &#8212; high documentation guidelines that would have never worked.&nbsp; So, immediately, Treasury cleared up those guidelines and got the remaining funds out.<br><br>After that, the President, as part of the American Rescue Plan, added another $21.5 billion of Emergency Rental Assistance.&nbsp;<br><br>Now, we have stressed and the President has continued to stress that state and local governments must do more &#8212; all of them &#8212; to accelerate the funding to these renters and landlords, particularly as we face the end of the eviction moratorium and the rise of the Delta variant.&nbsp;<br><br>Now, we recognize this is not an easy task.&nbsp; We, as a country, have never had a national infrastructure or national policy for preventing avoidable evictions.&nbsp; Matthew Desmond &#8212; many of you know, the author of “Evictions” &#8212; has estimated that 3.6 million evictions are filed every year in non-pandemic years and often for amounts as little as $500 or $600 of back rent.&nbsp;<br><br>So we realize the state and local governments are being asked to set up &#8212; are often being asked to set up some programs from scratch.<br><br>But we have listened to their concerns, we have listened to the concerns of others in the housing community, and we have responded.&nbsp; On May 7th and June 24th, we put forward significant guidance that made it clear that you can have simplified applications; you do not have to have documentation for income or non-traditional income or to show your hardship.&nbsp;<br><br>We put out things that allowed you to pay landlords in both payments or utilities for many tenants, and that you could use the funds not only to keep people in their homes, but to make sure that you could help people find new housing or help those homeless or at risk of being homeless.<br><br>With these reforms, we have seen many states and localities start to succeed, from Louisville to Houston, Harris County, to Virginia &#8212; to the state of Virginia.&nbsp; Many places are succeeding.&nbsp; We did see, in June, the numbers doubled to $1.5 billion in assistance that went out the door to renters and landlords helping 290,000 tenants.&nbsp; We expect these numbers to grow.&nbsp; But it will not be enough to meet the need unless every state and locality immediately accelerates funds to tenants.<br><br>The President is clear: If some states and localities can get this out efficiently and effectively, there&#8217;s no reason every state and locality can’t.&nbsp; There is simply no excuse, no place to hide for any state or locality that is failing to accelerate their Emergency Rental Assistance Fund.&nbsp;<br><br>So the President is asking today that, at the state and local court level, that they heed the call of the Department of Justice to pause evictions, to ensure that evictions are a last resort, not a first resort.&nbsp;<br><br>For those of you who remember, this is what we &#8212; the Department of Justice; Vanita Gupta &#8212; put out a major statement on and what we did &#8212; the White House summit with 46 cities &#8212; to work and encourage them to use these kind of diversionary proposals to avoid evictions.&nbsp;<br><br>At the request of the congressional leadership provi &#8212; mes- &#8212; mentioned, we&#8217;re investigating all reasons for any delay of state and local funds, and whether we have the power to compel more expeditious use.&nbsp;<br><br>He also is calling on utilities and landlords to use the funds that Congress has made available to them &#8212; the emergency eviction funds, but also other funds in water and heating that they can use before they move to evict.&nbsp;<br><br>And finally, he&#8217;s asking the Treasury Department to make clear: You cannot only use your Emergency Rental Assistance funds &#8212; the $46 billion &#8212; but any of the funds in the $300 billion state and local fund to help with dealing with housing needs of anyone hurt with the pandemic, and that includes working with courts and legal aid counselors, or to help give more incentives to landlords to cooperate with them, who are willing to house those who are homeless, those who are &#8212; have been evicted, or to provide more longer-term, stable housing to the most hard-pressed renters.<br><br>The message is very clear:&nbsp;This President wants to do everything within his power.&nbsp; We are still investigating what that legal authority is, whether there is any options that we can have on eviction moratoriums beyond what we&#8217;ve seen.&nbsp;<br><br>But you can be sure of one thing: Whatever is in the power of this President to do to prevent evictions, he is committed to doing.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Nancy.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you so much, Gene.&nbsp; So, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is still calling today for the administration to extend the eviction moratorium.&nbsp; She seems to believe that the administration can do it.&nbsp; So what is the disconnect here?&nbsp; Why does she believe you have the power to extend the moratorium but the administration is arguing you don’t?<br><br>MR. SPERLING:&nbsp; Well, I would say that on this particular issue, the President has not only kicked the tires; he has double, triple, quadruple checked.&nbsp; He has asked the CDC to look at whether you could even do targeted eviction moratorium &#8212; that just went to the counties that have higher rates &#8212; and they, as well, have been unable to find the legal authority for even new, targeted eviction moratoriums.&nbsp;<br><br>I mean, we share so much the goals of Speaker Pelosi and others on the Hill.&nbsp; You know, we mean this: This is a President who really understands the heartbreak of eviction.&nbsp; He is &#8212; the reason why he is pressing and pressing, even when legal authority looks slim, is because he wants to make sure we have explored every potential authority.&nbsp;<br><br>So, this is &#8212; again, this is a President who is double, triple, and quadrupling this, and is not just &#8212; and is responding by then saying, “If we don&#8217;t have legal authority in some place, then we need to do a wide administration and state and local look at where we do have the authority to act and prevent evictions.”<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But she and other House Democratic leaders said they got very little notice from the administration, that it felt that it was unable to extend the eviction moratorium.&nbsp; And Dick Durbin, the senator from Illinois, said a couple of hours ago, it looks like somebody “dropped the ball.”&nbsp; Did it take too long for the administration to determine that you weren&#8217;t going to be able to unilaterally extend the eviction moratorium?<br><br>MR. SPERLING:&nbsp; You know, I think the wording in the Supreme Court opinion was fairly, you know, clear that &#8212; they said the CDC did not &#8212; could not grant such extension without, quote, “clear and specific congressional authorization.”&nbsp; I think, really, what has happened, what we are all dealing with, is that the rise of the Delta variant is particularly harmful for those who are most likely to face evictions.&nbsp; And as that reality became more clear, going into the end of last week, I think all of us started asking, “What more could we do?”&nbsp;<br><br>And we were very focused and have been extremely focused on the state and local relief.&nbsp; Many of you might have saw that, on the 28th, we did a massive, wide effort to get news out to tenants and landlords where they could go.&nbsp; I compliment those like PayPal and Venmo who put it on the front of their app and tens of millions of people saw it.<br><br>But I think that when the Delta variant, you know, started to rise and that it hits this particular &#8212; you know, that it&#8217;s likely hit harder the people most likely to be low income, unvaccinated, that there was just an effort to go back and, again, double, triple, quadruple check.&nbsp; And I think &#8212; I think we&#8217;re &#8212; we were in that, and I think other people on the Hill have also been in.&nbsp;<br><br>So this was &#8212; this was us responding to a new reality and doing so with this aggressive set of actions that President Biden has asked, both at the state and local level, of his executive team, of even landlords, and those who run utilities.<br><br>But, I think, on the eviction moratorium issue, we have run into &#8212; we have run into, so far, what seems to be a very difficult obstacle from the Supreme Court ruling.&nbsp; And, again, the President went out of his way to push to the CDC today to look even at 30 days, even targeted to high &#8212; you know, counties with higher infections, and the CDC independently came back and said that they could not, at this time, find the legal authority.<br><br>I don&#8217;t think this means this President is going to give up.&nbsp; I think he&#8217;s going to keep looking and pushing and kicking the tires, and fifth, sixth looks.&nbsp; But we&#8217;re going to do everything we can.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But is there &#8212; is there any &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;Kaitlan.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; contention or any &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Kaitlan.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you very much.&nbsp; Thank you very much, Mr. Sperling.&nbsp; But the Delta variant has been around for weeks and has been the dominant strain in the United States for several weeks as well.&nbsp; So why did the President wait until Sunday to ask the CDC for a targeted moratorium focused on those areas with high case rates?<br><br>MR. SPERLING:&nbsp; I think what you&#8217;re seeing is a President who is just trying to do everything that he can in his power, and part of that is also going back to places where he has heard initially that we do not have legal authority.&nbsp; And he&#8217;s saying,<br>“This is so important I want to double and triple check.&nbsp; I want to ask the CDC independently, if they share that same reading of the Supreme Court&#8217;s view.”&nbsp; And I think he&#8217;s going to continue to look.<br><br>So I don&#8217;t think &#8212; I think this just reflects a continuation of a President who is looking at every possible authority we can do.&nbsp; And to be honest, when he is told there is not authority, his response is &#8212; because he cares so deeply &#8212; is to double, triple, quadruple check, and that&#8217;s exactly what him going to the CDC represented.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I just think the question from progressive &#8212; even progressive Democrats &#8212; is that you got this ruling from the Supreme Court at the end of June, so why did it take so long to call on Congress to act?&nbsp; If it is so important to him, why did it take so long to go to the CDC for this 30-day moratorium that he was seeking?<br><br>MR. SPERLING:&nbsp; Well, again, I think that the fact that the Supreme Court had ruled that way &#8212; I mean, remember, we knowingly faced some legal risk &#8212; supported extending the moratorium to July 31st.&nbsp; The Supreme Court ruled, chose not to strike that down.&nbsp; But the ruling said very, very clearly that that was because it was rolling off on July 31st and that extensions would require congressional authorization.&nbsp; That &#8212; that is clear &#8212; those wordings are nothing special for us; they&#8217;re something anybody here, you know, can read.&nbsp;<br><br>I think what you saw was that, as the Delta variant was worse, that there was just, you know, the passion to not only look for everything we knew we had the power to do, but a lot of what he&#8217;s doing is asking us to check &#8212; double check, triple, quadruple check.<br><br>And that&#8217;s also in terms of what he&#8217;s asking those of us in the White House to do with the agencies.&nbsp; Where agencies have given more narrow opinions on their authorities and powers, he&#8217;s asking us to go back and push.<br><br>On, you know, again, the state and local moratorium, this is not insignificant.&nbsp; Thirty-three &#8212; one in three people are in states where they have some additional length of protection due to state and local moratoriums.&nbsp; The Supreme Court does not affect that.&nbsp; So, he is asking to extend that as well.&nbsp;<br><br>So, again, I think, you know, what you&#8217;re seeing here is a consistent behavior.&nbsp; And I think the truth is many people came to the same realization, which was that even though the eviction moratorium was supposed to end on the 31st; even though the CDC had said it was their last extension; even though the Supreme Court had seemed to clearly state that, beyond that, had been &#8212; would require authorization, there was still a desire, a passion by this President to go back and say, “Are we sure?&nbsp; Are we sure?”&nbsp; And he is still asking that question.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s what he was pressing with the CDC.<br><br>So, it&#8217;s not a first &#8212; it&#8217;s not that this is the first he&#8217;s doing on this.&nbsp; He is at &#8212; this is part of a continuation of him looking down every corner, kicking every tire, doing everything we can for whatever authority we have or policies we can do to protect people &#8212; protect against unnecessary evictions, particularly of those who&#8217;ve been hurt by the pandemic.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Jonathan.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gene, is there any indication, or is it the contention of this administration, that the undistributed funds that the state and local governments haven’t distributed haven&#8217;t been done so for political reasons?&nbsp; And if so, what&#8217;s your reaction to that?<br><br>MR. SPERLING:&nbsp; I&#8217;m sorry, that they haven&#8217;t been distributed?<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That they haven’t been distributed.&nbsp; You are investigating the non-distribution of some of those funds.&nbsp; Is &#8212;<br><br>MR. SPERLING:&nbsp; I think much of it &#8212; I mean, again, I think that our country did not have a national infrastructure for doing this.&nbsp; I mean, $1.5 billion went out in June.&nbsp; That is not nearly enough.&nbsp; That is certainly more than has ever happened in a month in our country.&nbsp;<br><br>So Congress asked us to set that up, for that to be imposed at a state and local level.&nbsp; So it requires every state and local government, many of them to set up processes.&nbsp;<br><br>So I&#8217;m not tr- &#8212; again, I understand the challenges they were facing, but right now, there&#8217;s no excuse for somebody having a complicated application process.&nbsp; There&#8217;s no excuse for somebody to have excessive documentation.&nbsp; Your government has told you that you can create very simple application processes, and you are able to see that your peers in other states and cities are successfully implementing this.&nbsp;<br><br>And so, this is the time where we want to especially say: There&#8217;s no excuses.&nbsp; If it works in some places, there&#8217;s no reason it can&#8217;t work in every place.&nbsp;<br><br>If you ask me, I think there&#8217;s &#8212; there&#8217;s a lot of excessive cautiousness and conservativism.&nbsp; And, you know, at some point, you have to push people that we are giving you the flexibility to get these funds out.&nbsp; We are not telling you &#8212; you can rely on self-attestation for hardship, for income.&nbsp; You can rely on both payments.&nbsp; You can rely on factual predicates like how low-income the housing area or neighborhood is.&nbsp;<br><br>At this point, some places may still feel like they have to be overly careful and cautious.&nbsp; And we are saying, &#8220;No you don&#8217;t.&nbsp; You need to get these funds out.&#8221;&nbsp;<br><br>But I will say the following, too: This &#8212; the American Rescue Plan, in addition to this funds, gave people $350 billion in state and local funds.&nbsp; Those funds are also available.&nbsp; So, when people say, &#8220;Well, we need more counselors,&#8221; or, &#8220;We could do more mediation if we could hire mediators or legal services,&#8221; or, &#8220;We could help support the court systems, you know, helping to tell people to first seek Emergency Rental Assistance&#8221; &#8212; they fully have that ability.&nbsp; They, in fact, have two pots of money: They can go from the Emergency Rental Assistance, or they can go from the American Rescue Plan.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So what can you do about that?<br><br>MR. SPERLING:&nbsp; I&#8217;m not going to tell you that Congress gave us a lot of sticks and punitive measures and carrots, but we&#8217;re doing everything we can, and we have.&nbsp;<br><br>If you look at the May 7th guidance that we did, it was very significant and it was widely praised by advocates around the country.&nbsp; It sped up the time that you had to give funds to a tenant directly, if a landlord didn&#8217;t participate.&nbsp; It made clear you could do bulk payments.&nbsp; It made clear you could rely on self-attestation.&nbsp;<br><br>And then when we heard that there were issues, like they weren&#8217;t sure they could help people who were homeless, we came back on June 24th and made clear that you can &#8212; that you could for a future debt obligation.&nbsp;<br><br>So, again, I understand that &#8212; that hard is hard and setting up a national infrastructure on Emergency Rental Assistance, you know, immediately is a challenge.&nbsp; But I think we are now at the point where we feel people have had time, they have &#8212; we have listened to their concerns.&nbsp; We have given them enormous flexibility.&nbsp; They are seeing their peers, they&#8217;re seeing other states and cities succeeding, and there&#8217;s no excuse for them not doing so.<br><br>I will say that, on September 30th, the one stick you have is that the Treasury Department is allowed to reallocate among places that have not used 65 percent of their &#8212; of the first $25 billion. &nbsp;So that is something the Deputy Secretary of Treasury has made clear.<br><br>And we have reached out to so many cities, so many governors, so many meetings with the National League of Cities, national Conference of Mayors.&nbsp; And many of them are working very well with us.&nbsp; Many of them &#8212;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is happening with Florida, sir?<br><br>MR. SPERLING:&nbsp; &#8212; are doing but &#8212; but we &#8212; but we are &#8212; but we &#8212; but, you know, we are pressing harder now, as we should, with the end of the eviction moratorium.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I ask you about Florida, sir?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; We&#8217;re just going to have (inaudible).<br><br>Justin, why don&#8217;t you go?<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; Gene, are you saying that Congress dropped the ball here, essentially?&nbsp; I mean, you said that they&#8217;ve written the plan and you guys don&#8217;t have a lot of tools to fix it.&nbsp; So, is that &#8212; is that what you&#8217;re saying?<br><br>MR. SPERLING:&nbsp; No, not at all.&nbsp; I think what they did was historic.&nbsp;&nbsp; I think that we, as a country, have never had a policy to prevent avoidable evictions.&nbsp; Again, Matt Desmond says, in a normal year, you have over 300,000 month, and actually, August is one of the worst.&nbsp; That&#8217;s the average between 2000 and 2016.&nbsp; And he &#8212; and the Eviction Lab shows that many of those people were evicted for just five, six hundred dollars of back rent.<br><br>So, I think the idea that Congress pushed for us to create a national infrastructure that we could get this out is &#8212; and to put the &#8212; put the amount of money in there that could help make landlords whole.&nbsp;<br><br>Remember, the thing about the Emergency Rental Assistance that&#8217;s so important is that it helps struggling landlords and struggling tenants.&nbsp; It can pay up to 18 month, forward or backwards, of back rent or back utilities.&nbsp; So, it is a way to make a landlord, who is struggling, whole, while also keeping that tenant and their family safe and secure.<br><br>I&#8217;m just expressing the reality of why &#8212; of the fact that we do whatever we can with the tools we have.&nbsp; And we have found that the guidance has worked: listening to people, making clear you could use self-attestation, making clear you could have low documentation.&nbsp;<br><br>It has worked in many places.&nbsp; Again, I mentioned Louisville; Harris County; Virginia.&nbsp; That&#8217;s just a small sample of the places it&#8217;s working.&nbsp;<br><br>So we think what Congress did was historic, and we think it has the potential to help enormously.<br><br>And, look, people shouldn&#8217;t think that this is hopeless.&nbsp; You know, yes, people do reports of 6 million being behind, but when you look at the poll survey and the federal &#8212; in the Philadelphia Federal Reserve, they&#8217;re talking about, you know, a little less than 2 million really, really being a threat.&nbsp; We help nearly 300,000.&nbsp; If we can get those numbers up &#8212; imagine if you were at 500,000; that meant you to be helping one and a half million over a few-month period.&nbsp;<br><br>So, if states and local governments rise to this great resources that this Congress wisely gave to them, there is every reason to believe that they could have a substantial effect in mitigating these evictions.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s why we&#8217;re pressing so hard, and that&#8217;s why we&#8217;re going to look for every bit &#8212; bit of authority or persuasion or guidance that we can make.&nbsp;<br><br>I&#8217;m just saying that the reality is there&#8217;s not like a punitive stick.&nbsp; That doesn&#8217;t mean that there was anything wrong with the &#8212; with what I think is really a historic element of the American Rescue Plan that I think could not only be helpful now, but going forward in preventing unnecessary evictions that we know have often heartbreaking and longer-term impacts on families and their economic and health stability.&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I&#8217;m just going to go to Yamiche.&nbsp; We got to wrap it up after that.&nbsp; Let’s go to the farther back.&nbsp; Go ahead, Yamiche.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks so much for taking my question.&nbsp; And thanks, Jen &#8212;<br><br>MR. SPERLING:&nbsp; Sure.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; for adding one more.&nbsp; I guess my question is &#8212; it&#8217;s two part: One, why not force the Supreme Court to make this decision?&nbsp; And, two, is that decision not to actually go to the Supreme Court and force them to strike it down &#8212; does it have anything to do with fears that the Supreme Court might strike down the administration&#8217;s broad use of public health laws for other policies?<br><br>MR. SPERLING:&nbsp; You know, I do not neces- &#8212; I believe that people have been examining whether there is legal authority to go forward, period &#8212; whether it&#8217;s a legally available option.&nbsp;<br><br>For me personally: Yeah, I &#8212; you always have to worry about whether you do something that could create harm.&nbsp; That&#8217;s a factor to think about.&nbsp; Is it an overwhelming factor?&nbsp; I can&#8217;t tell you.&nbsp; But, you know, I think when you&#8217;re governing, you have to look at all these issues and &#8212; and see.<br><br>I think the President is still kicking every corner, because I think if there&#8217;s any chance that you could get this extension, he wants to know every available authority.&nbsp;<br><br>But it is a consideration that I think, you know, may have affected some of us.&nbsp; But I can&#8217;t say that that &#8212; I &#8212; you know, that &#8212; that I think, within our legal counsel in the CDC, I think they have spoken mostly about simply whether there is that legal authority to go forward.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you have an example (inaudible)?<br><br>MR. SPERLING:&nbsp; But again, I want to make clear: You&#8217;ve seen this President is continuing to double, triple, quadruple check on those issues and to ask all of us to look in every corner and kick every tire and double, triple, quadruple check if there&#8217;s any possible way that we can afford.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Could you give an example of what might be the things that you&#8217;re worried about the Supreme Court striking down?&nbsp; What unnecessary &#8212; what, maybe, unintended consequences &#8212;<br><br>MR. SPERLING:&nbsp; Are you trying to get me &#8212;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; might come from them?<br><br>MR. SPERLING: &nbsp;Are you trying to get me in trouble with Dana Remus? &nbsp;(Laughter.) &nbsp;Are you like &#8212; are you like trying to make me persona non grata with &#8212; (laughter) &#8212; with our General White House Counsel? &nbsp;I&#8217;ll pass. &nbsp;(Laughter.)<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it 2 million people though?&nbsp; Is that the number that this White House believes could end up losing their homes as a result of this?<br><br>MR. SPERLING:&nbsp; I am saying that those who are &#8212; no.&nbsp; Those are people &#8212; those are the estimates for &#8212; you know, 1.4 to 1.9 are people who fear that they could be at a deeper level.&nbsp; A large percent &#8212; a significant percentage of them are in states where there&#8217;s eviction &#8212; the moratorium is in increase.&nbsp;<br><br>We have lots of indications that the kind of diversionary policies that we are doing is helping.&nbsp; And also, remember we&#8217;re at almost 300,000.&nbsp; If we&#8217;re up to four or five hundred thousand, then you could be talking about helping well over a million people in a few-month period.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But how many people could lose their homes?<br><br>MR. SPERLING:&nbsp; But what I&#8217;m trying to say is that &#8212; what I was trying to say is that we are pushing hard because we do believe that if state and local governments were to accelerate &#8212; if all of them were to do as well as the best performers are &#8212; what I&#8217;m trying to say is that it could make a sizable impact<br>on mitigation because &#8212; you know, because you’re &#8212; because those type of numbers, over a few-month period, you could have a substantial impact.&nbsp; That said, not everyone.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But what’s the number that America should brace for?&nbsp; How many people does this White House believe could lose their home because of this?<br><br>MR. SPERLING:&nbsp; I do not &#8212; I do not have an estimate.&nbsp; What I was trying to discourage against was the use of just the largest &#8212; I mean, sometimes people are just using what is the percentage of $45 billion, or what is the percentage of everybody who says they didn&#8217;t back-pay.&nbsp; And it can make it seem like things &#8212; it can understate the degree of progress.&nbsp;<br><br>If you feel like being able to help several hundred thousand a month over a few months, you know, it could matter a lot.&nbsp; And if we could get all the states and local governments, I&#8217;m saying that you could make a sizable impact.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But millions?<br><br>MR. SPERLING:&nbsp; What&#8217;s that?<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you foresee millions of people losing their homes?&nbsp;<br><br>MR. SPERLING:&nbsp; No.&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Gene, thank you very much.&nbsp; He&#8217;s available.&nbsp; He works here, so &#8212;<br><br>MR. SPERLING:&nbsp; No, I &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; &#8212; he gets to help us out more.<br><br>MR. SPERLING:&nbsp; No, I don’t. &nbsp;I just was identifying what a more targeted num- &#8212; estimates are of the people who say in surveys that they feel, at some point, not ju- &#8212; you know, at some point.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s why this &#8212; and I&#8217;m saying that&#8217;s why the assistance is so important, because you could hit a sizable impact of people who could be at risk each month if everybody was operating.&nbsp; It would &#8212; could be a meaningful number, though, you know, every eviction is a heartbreaking.&nbsp;<br><br>You know, so I don&#8217;t want to play down those who might st- &#8212; who could still face it, but just to stress that the state and local governments accelerating &#8212; we’re at 290,000 &#8212; if it keeps getting larger and larger every month and sustains for several months, that it could have a sizable impact.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.<br><br>MR. SPERLING: &nbsp;Thank you.&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Thank you, Gene.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a native, though, it’s “<em>Loo-uh-vul</em>,” not “<em>Loo-ee-vil</em>.”&nbsp; (Laughs.)<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Okay.<br><br>MR. SPERLING:&nbsp; They’re just the team that beat Michigan in the finals.&nbsp; (Laughter.)<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Learning new things every day.&nbsp;<br><br>Okay, a couple things for you all at the top, in addition.&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, the Department of Education released their Return to School Roadmap, of great interest to many parents, students, educators, and communities across the country.&nbsp; It outlines their &#8212; the community resources and support they need for a safe and healthy school year this fall.&nbsp; Thanks to the American Rescue Plan, every school has the resources they need to ensure every student can learn in person, which is &#8212; absolutely remains our objective.&nbsp;<br><br>The Roadmap addresses three landmarks and provides strategies and resources to get communities there, including health and safety; vaccinations for Americans 12 and older and indoor masking; social, emotional, and mental health support for students; and accelerating academic achievement.&nbsp;<br><br>The President has been clear that it is a top priority to have children in school, in person, full-time this fall, and he has secured the resources to help ensure we can do that safely. &nbsp;<br><br>I&#8217;ll also note that I&#8217;ve invited Secretary Cardona to come join us in the briefing room this week, so we&#8217;re working to schedule that, as well, to give you all a briefing and an update.&nbsp;<br><br>I also wanted to note that with Congress on recess for most of August, we are launching a huge push throughout the month to promote President Biden&#8217;s Build Back Better agenda and highlight the success of the President&#8217;s first six months in office, especially in delivering economic relief to the American people, creating record number of jobs for an administration&#8217;s first five months, and spurring on the fastest economic growth during the first half of the year in almost four decades.&nbsp;<br><br>In addition to a regular cadence of White House messaging to support the Build Back Better agenda, key principals &#8212; including the Vice President, the First Lady, the Second Gentleman &#8212; will fan out to hold events in communities across the country, touting the President&#8217;s Build Back Better plan to drive more economic growth and invest in America&#8217;s middle-class families by cutting taxes for families with children, lowering healthcare costs, and meeting with mom- &#8212; meeting the moment on climate change.&nbsp; The President also promote his agenda throughout the month.&nbsp;<br><br>They&#8217;ll be joined in that effort by the Cabinet, which will be stumping in every corner of the country on the importance of passing both the bipartisan infrastructure bill &#8212; can we call it the “BIB” now?&nbsp;&#8212; I’m going to try &#8212; and the Build Back Better agenda to invest in our economy’s strength, make life better for all families, and confront the existential challenge of climate change.&nbsp;<br><br>As part of that, in the first two weeks of August alone, 14 Cabinet secretaries will travel to at least 26 cities in 13 states and the District of Columbia, with additional events being added.&nbsp;<br><br>As just one example, Secretaries Walsh and Raimondo will be heading to New York City this Wednesday to highlight the broad support from both labor and business community for the President&#8217;s economic vision.<br><br>With that, Jonathan, kick us off.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; First, one follow-up to the evictions thing, and then moving on to &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; foreign policy.&nbsp; Quickly, on this: From the briefing we just received, it seems like the White House does not want to challenge this in court.&nbsp; But lawmakers &#8212; Democratic lawmakers who are unhappy with the response so far are basically saying &#8212; I&#8217;m paraphrasing &#8212; “Don&#8217;t let Brett Kavanaugh stand in the way of this.”&nbsp; Why not take executive action now to direct the CDC and deal with the court later on?&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I think what you should have taken from the statement that was put out right before the briefing, and also Gene joining us in the briefing today, is that the President has not given up the option of legal action.&nbsp; He has asked his team to look, to kick the tires &#8212; just to keep the analogy going &#8212; and look at every authority, every option we have to keep more people in their homes.&nbsp; That is his objective.<br><br>At the same time, he&#8217;s also focused on the policy options that are at play, whether it&#8217;s encouraging states to use funding; to get the funding out; to extend the moratorium by 30 days, 60 days in some states, that can keep people in their homes; and to see what other policy options we have at our disposal.<br><br>So we are using every tool we can.&nbsp; He is still &#8212; we are still kicking the &#8212; looking at legal authorities to see what is possible.&nbsp; But he&#8217;s not going to take a step without legal authority to do so.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And how much more time is he going to kick the tires?&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, it&#8217;s clearly a priority to the President, given the statement &#8212; the extensive statement we put out this afternoon.&nbsp; He was laser-focused on this all weekend &#8212; I can confirm for you &#8212; and has been from the beginning of the administration.<br><br>I mean, as a reminder, I know Gene touched on this, but he wanted to see an extension in January in the American Rescue Plan.&nbsp; It obviously wasn&#8217;t in there. &nbsp;The CDC extended the moratorium not once but three times.&nbsp; We made clear when we did the last extension that that would likely be the last extension because of the legal limitations.&nbsp; But, you know, he&#8217;s going to keep pushing to see what the options are available to him and if there are any additional options available.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then the foreign policy matter: Now that the United States &#8212; per the Secretary of State&#8217;s statement yesterday &#8212; agrees with Israel and the UK that Iran was behind the attack against the ship, would the U.S. support an Israeli retaliatory strike on Iran?&nbsp; And how does this matter impact at all the U.S. position in the indirect nuclear talks, if they restart?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, as a sovereign country, Israel is going to make their own decisions.&nbsp; But I will say that as it relates to our own engagement in nuclear talks &#8212; which we, of course, do have authorities over or do have decisions to make there &#8212; our view is that every single challenge and threat we face from Iran would be made more pronounced and dangerous by an unconstrained nuclear program.&nbsp;<br><br>So, put another way, constraining Iran’s nuclear program by returning to the JCPOA will put us in a better position to address these other problems.&nbsp; It doesn&#8217;t mean that it will take care of the other issues that had been ongoing concerns we&#8217;ve had with Iran.&nbsp; They are a bad actor on the global stage.&nbsp; They have threatened our own military, as we all know.&nbsp; But we continue to believe that pursuing a diplomatic path forward, that pursuing an opportunity to make sure we have greater visibility into what their nuclear capabilities are is in our national interest.&nbsp;<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; Just quickly: On Friday, the President was asked whether Americans should expect more guidelines coming out because of COVID, because of the Delta variant.&nbsp; And he said, “In all probability.”&nbsp; So what&#8217;s on the table right now?&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I’m not &#8212; obviously, the President is keeping the option open of making sure that he is &#8212; that the CDC and our public health officials can make recommendations on what&#8217;s needed to keep the American people safe.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not in a position to preview that or to get ahead of any decisions they may make.<br><br>What I can reiterate, though, is &#8212; and you heard Dr. Fauci and Dr. Collins reiterate this, this weekend &#8212; we&#8217;ve been clear we&#8217;re not going back to the shutdowns of March of 2020.&nbsp; We are not going back to the economy shutting down.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve made too much progress.&nbsp; Too many people are vaccinated.&nbsp; There&#8217;s been too much progress on the economic front.&nbsp;<br><br>But, again, he has said from the beginning that we&#8217;re going to be guided by the science, guided by our public health experts, and we&#8217;re not going to take options off the table of what they may recommend.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then just on Israel, but different topic: The NIH Director says he doesn&#8217;t see a need for booster shots, yet we&#8217;re seeing this model out of Israel suggesting that boosters are beneficial.&nbsp; So is Israel ahead of the curve on this one?&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, if you&#8217;re referring to the Israel data from a couple of weeks ago &#8212; is that the data? &#8212;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mm-hmm.&nbsp; Mm-hmm.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; &#8212; which was not fully extensive and fully published at the time; I&#8217;m not sure if there have been additional details since then &#8212; our health experts continue to look at whether there would be a need for boosters.&nbsp;<br><br>I would remind you, too: We have, from the beginning, planned for a range of contingencies as we have purchased supply of vaccines, just in case there are boosters needed. &nbsp;There hasn&#8217;t been a decision made by our public health experts that it is needed, even for a portion of the population.&nbsp; If that decision is needed, we will be prepared as a government.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, also following up: Last week, President Biden was asked about the Justice Department or &#8212; additional things that can be done for vaccine mandates.&nbsp; And he said that the Justice Department was looking at that.&nbsp; He didn&#8217;t have an answer yet.<br><br>Can you elaborate what the Justice Department may be looking at or exploring, in terms of mandating vaccines?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I think Karine said this on Thursday or Friday &#8212; that a federal mandate from the federal government is not on the table.&nbsp;<br><br>So, I think what the President was referring to is the fact that employers can take that step, just as the federal government &#8212; and you&#8217;ve seen agencies do that &#8212; has the authority to take that step, according to the OLC.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, he&#8217;s not looking at it the way that the administration did with mask mandates, where it was mandated on federal property that you had to have a mask.&nbsp; There&#8217;s not a similar exploration of doing vaccines that way to encourage more people to get the vaccine?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Not across the country, no.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; And, just to be clear, can vaccinated people be indoors with other vaccinated people?&nbsp; I mean, is that the &#8212; is that okay for people to be doing in &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I know Dr. Collins spoke to this during one of his interviews this weekend, and the good news is there&#8217;s a COVID briefing coming up this afternoon where you can ask questions of our public health experts.&nbsp; But they&#8217;ve not changed that guidance in their &#8212; in their &#8212; the guidance from last week.&nbsp; They updated guidance on masks, but I certainly would encourage you to ask them that during the briefing.<br><br>Go ahead.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; Back to the evictions.&nbsp; Several states, including New York and Florida, have been slow to disburse available federal aid to landlords and renters.&nbsp; In Florida, some 2 percent of available funding has been disbursed.<br><br>So I&#8217;m wondering: Has the White House been in touch with Governor DeSantis, for instance, and other state leaders to see what the holdup is?&nbsp; And what do those discussions look like?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We certainly &#8212; I can&#8217;t speak to any &#8212; any contact specifically with Governor DeSantis about this, but we have been in touch with state authorities and localities about what the holdup is or what the delay is in getting this funding out.<br><br>And as Gene conveyed very clearly, $1.5 billion has been &#8212; was distributed in June.&nbsp; That was faster &#8212; that was greater than the five months prior or the four months prior.&nbsp; That&#8217;s a good step.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not nearly enough.<br><br>And certainly, getting the additional funding out there will help keep more people in their homes, which is our goal, which is Speaker Pelosi&#8217;s goal.<br><br>So, absolutely, we&#8217;re in touch with local housing authorities and leaders and states to ensure they&#8217;re moving this ball forward.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, in light of the ACLU&#8217;s decision to go back to court over Title 42 and push the administration to roll that back, does the President view it as a Trump-era restriction that he just needs more time to unwind?&nbsp; Or after roughly six months of using it, does he now view it as a necessary tool to maintain control of the border?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Neither.&nbsp; The President views it as a public health measure where the CDC is going to continue to provide guidance on how long it needs to be in place.<br><br>We have not given a timeline of when we will &#8212; they will lift Title 42, but we will look for them to provide us that guidance.&nbsp;<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And about public health at the border, is the President concerned that migrants who are coming in, in great numbers, are not being tested for COVID at their first point of contact with Border Patrol?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, let me give you a little bit of an understanding of what actually happens when people come across the border.&nbsp;<br><br>First, as &#8212; to Katie&#8217;s earlier question, there&#8217;s been no change in Title 42, so families and single adults are expelled, if possible, when apprehended at the southern border.&nbsp; That&#8217;s step one.&nbsp;<br><br>Those who can&#8217;t be expelled are often placed &#8212; and this, I think, goes to your question &#8212; in alternatives to detention programs while their cases are being reviewed.<br><br>CBP provides migrants with PPE from the moment they are taken into custody, and migrants are required to keep masks on at all times, including when they are transferred or in the process of being released.<br><br>Our other protocol is if anyone exhibits signs of illness in CBP custody, they&#8217;re referred to local health systems for appropriate testing, diagnosis, isolation, and treatment.&nbsp; That is our process.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; And then just about COVID safety: Is President Obama setting the wrong example about how serious COVID-19 is by hosting a big birthday party with hundreds of people this week?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would certainly refer you to the team who is working for my former boss to give you more specifics of what the protocols are in place.<br><br>But I would note, first, that former President Obama has been a huge advocate of individuals getting vaccinated.&nbsp; When CDC provided guid- &#8212; has provided &#8212; what CDC has provided guidance on is for indoor settings in high or substantial high zones of COVID cases.&nbsp;<br><br>This event, according to all the public reporting, is outdoors and in a moderate zone.&nbsp; But in addition, there is testing requirements and other steps they are taking, which I&#8217;m sure they can outline for you in more detail.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But is there any concern, just because &#8212; as you said here, and you&#8217;ve had people saying over the last couple days &#8212; vaccinated people can still spread this Delta variant around?&nbsp; So is there concern that this President Obama birthday party might become a super-spreader event?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I think, Peter, the guidance is about what steps people can take when they&#8217;re in public settings &#8212;&nbsp;indoor settings, specifically, was the new guidance &#8212; to keep themselves and others safe.<br><br>In terms of what protocols they are taking, I would refer you to them, and I&#8217;m sure they can give you more details.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And just last one.&nbsp; So, people who are watching this at home and they see, “Well, if President Obama can have a party with several hundred people,” should they think that it is okay for them to have a party with several hundred people now?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, we certainly advise everyone to follow public health guidelines, which I know the former President, who is a huge advocate of getting vaccinated, of following the guidance of public health experts, would certainly advocate for himself as well.<br><br>Go ahead, Kelly.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator Lindsey Graham has announced that he has tested positive for COVID after being vaccinated and will be doing some self-isolating, which could have an impact on &#8212; for example, the bipartisan infrastructure.&nbsp; So what is your reaction to that?&nbsp;<br><br>And, secondly, does the administration feel like they need to get more sources of information on breakthrough cases, given the anecdotal experience many people are having of seeing more incidents of that &#8212; beyond just the issue of hospitalizations and deaths, but more information about how much the breakthrough cases are spreading?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, let me first say that every single piece of available evidence shows that breakthrough infections are rare and mild, and that is according to a range of data.&nbsp; So according to new research from Kaiser Family Foundation from January to July, the rate of breakthrough cases reported to states is below 1 percent.&nbsp;<br><br>We&#8217;ve seen data come out from England, Scotland, Canada, and Israel showing that vaccines are about 80 percent effective in preventing illness from Delta and about 90 percent effective in prese- &#8212; preventing hospitalizations by Delta.&nbsp;<br><br>CDC is actively tracking tens of thousands of people in cohort studies &#8212; as I think you know and we&#8217;ve talked about a little bit in here &#8212; some of them doing weekly PCR testing, which includes healthcare professionals, first responders, hospitalized adults, and people in long-term care facilities.&nbsp; Also states and hospital associations are reporting their own data.&nbsp;<br><br>Now, we know there&#8217;s an interest in getting that data.&nbsp; We support that.&nbsp; Dr. Walensky says that they plan to release that as well, which we, of course, support as well and it&#8217;s important for you all to look at.<br><br>But I would note that &#8212; and I thought this was important because if you look at the power of vaccinations, you&#8217;re looking at specifically the numbers of &#8212; according to seven-day averages of January versus July.&nbsp; January is, of course, the lighter numbers, and then the darker number is July.&nbsp; And if you look at hospital admissions and deaths, this is really in &#8212; because of the impact of the vaccine and how effective it is at preventing people from being hospitalized and dying from COVID.&nbsp;<br><br>We certainly do hope that Senator Graham is &#8212; has a speedy recovery and is &#8212; experiences mild symptoms.&nbsp; And, you know, we wish him the best of health through that.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In places like Florida where hospitalizations are at a record level &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; is there any concern about the number of resources available, rationing of care, additional equipment that needs to be sent in, or personnel to assist?<br><br>MS. PSAKI: Well, one, we are &#8212; we stand ready and available to provide any assistance that is needed, whether that is Florida or any other part of the country.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve done these strike forces.&nbsp; We are at a very different point in the pandemic than we were a couple of months ago.&nbsp; We have ample vaccine.&nbsp; We have ample experts.&nbsp; We have ample resources to provide them.<br><br>You know, I will note, as you touched on there, 20 percent of the cases we&#8217;re seeing are in Florida.&nbsp; There are steps and precautions that can be taken, including encouraging people to get vaccinated, encouraging people to wear masks, including allowing &#8212; allowing schools to mandate masks, and allow &#8212; allowing kids to wear masks, which is not the current state of play in Florida.<br><br>So, you know, at a certain point, leaders are going to have to choose whether they&#8217;re going to follow public health guidelines or they&#8217;re going to follow politics, and we certainly encourage all governors to follow the public health guidelines.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; As you know, UK and EU are now reopening to vaccinated travelers from the U.S.&nbsp; Can you give us an update on the decision-making process here in the U.S. about whether and when to reciprocate?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Certainly understand the question.&nbsp; I know there&#8217;s a lot of people out there who are eager to see loved ones, to travel, to return to flights between our country and many countries in Europe.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have an update.&nbsp;<br><br>There&#8217;s ongoing discussions, on a policy level, with public health officials.&nbsp; As you know, we have these ongoing working groups, but I don&#8217;t have an update on the timeline of a decision.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then the HHS Inspector General announced today that they are opening an investigation into this large tent camp at Fort Bliss that houses migrant children because of reports that kids were having panic attacks and exhibiting self-harm.&nbsp; I&#8217;m wondering: Have any changes been made already to address some of those concerns?&nbsp; And how big of a concern has this been for HHS and the White House?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, thank you for the question.&nbsp; Secretary Becerra did speak to this last week.&nbsp; HHS does take every allegation for wrongdoing seriously and swiftly report allegations not only to the officer &#8212; Office of the Inspector General, but to the appropriate local authorities.<br><br>I would say that there have been actions that &#8212; some of &#8212; some of the reports of conditions are several weeks old or even longer than that, and so there have been steps that have been taken to make improvements on the ground &#8212; including children at Fort Bliss meet with a case manager on a weekly basis, and we have close to 60 mental health and behavioral counselors on site working with the children.<br><br>One of the issues that was raised was the lack of mental health access, so that&#8217;s a step we&#8217;ve &#8212; that the HHS team has worked to improve.&nbsp; More than 1,000 staff at the ORR, at Fort Bliss, have received required training, including child best welfare practices, behavior management, trauma-informed care, cultural competence, and reporting.&nbsp; Training is ongoing as well.&nbsp;<br><br>And this is certainly an issue we take quite seriously.&nbsp; These reports were made directly to the Office of the Inspector General, and improvements have been made.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, we’re told you have a hard out soon, so maybe, like, two more.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.&nbsp; A couple of quick questions &#8212; one on vaccine misinformation.&nbsp; Since President Biden and the Surgeon General, you know, have spoken about the issue &#8212; you’ve spoken about it as well &#8212; has the White House seen the companies, specifically Facebook and the other social media companies, take any steps to address vaccine misinformation? &nbsp;Any notable changes that you have seen?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; It&#8217;s a really great question.&nbsp; I will have to talk to our team and see if there&#8217;s any specific &#8212; specific notes of improvement that we can call out.&nbsp; I&#8217;m happy to do that or connect you with them directly.&nbsp;<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so the reason I ask is obviously because, you know, they &#8212; we&#8217;re seeing this increase in vaccinations again, and that seems to be tied to the number of cases going up.&nbsp; But we&#8217;re just sort of wondering if there is anything that we can tie back to maybe some of the misinformation campaigns being contained.&nbsp;<br><br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, look, I think that it&#8217;s hard to draw a connection to one specific step in any local community.&nbsp; But there&#8217;s no question &#8212; you see this anecdotally through a lot of your reporting &#8212; which is where people see their neighbor got a vaccine, their friends got a vaccine, and they&#8217;re okay.&nbsp; And on the flip side of it, they had a friend or a neighbor who was hospitalized, and it made them go and get a vaccine.&nbsp;<br><br>So, certainly, it&#8217;s an ongoing battle against misinformation.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not just on Facebook &#8212; though that is a mechanism for misinformation traveling, no question.&nbsp; It is through a range of mediums.&nbsp; We all have a responsibility.<br><br>But we are certainly seeing &#8212; in the states where there are higher case rates, we&#8217;ve seen record rates of enc- &#8212; I should say, very encouraging rates of vaccination.&nbsp; And that can be because of a number of factors.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sorry, I just had one more on voting rights quickly.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are 100 state legislators who are converging in D.C. today from over 20 states.&nbsp; They&#8217;re going to be meeting with Texas Democrats.&nbsp; We did see the Vice President meet with Texas Democrats earlier.&nbsp; I just was curious if the President and the Vice President plan to meet with these lawmakers and if they have any message for them.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, first, I would say the President and Vice President &#8212; the message to them is: We stand with you and believe that voting rights are a fundamental right for the American people across the country.&nbsp; And the President would love to sign voting rights legislation into law.&nbsp; He will continue to &#8212; this will continue to be a fight of his presidency, and that&#8217;s why he&#8217;s asked the Vice President to lead this effort.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two quick ones for you.&nbsp; The U.S. has now hit the President&#8217;s July 4th goal to get 70 percent of American adults with one shot.&nbsp; What is his reaction to that goal being a month late?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, his &#8212; it was a goal that he set &#8212; we set as an administration because we believe in bold, ambitious goals.&nbsp; I would say it&#8217;s a significant step that we have hit 70 percent of people in this country &#8212; of adults who are vaccinated.&nbsp; That&#8217;s a good sign.&nbsp; It will help protect communities.&nbsp; It will help protect families and save more lives.<br><br>But we&#8217;ve said from the beginning: Even when we set this goal, our work would not be done even when we reached it, and so we&#8217;re forging ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I want to follow up on something from Friday, which is that &#8212; that was said on Friday &#8212; agencies are going to be paying the cost of testing for workers who choose not to get vaccinated.&nbsp; Does that mean taxpayers are going to be paying for the tests of federal workers who chose not to get vaccinated?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I am &#8212; certainly, I can check with federal &#8212; with each agency.&nbsp; It may be different agency to agency, but it&#8217;s typically &#8212; probably would be a part of their funding.&nbsp; But I can check and see if there&#8217;s more clarification on that front.<br><br>I know we have to wrap, but, Mona, I know you came in and came out.&nbsp; So why don’t you end us off here?<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Thank you so much.&nbsp; I appreciate it, Jen.&nbsp; A couple of things.&nbsp; I wanted to follow up: I was asking the President on Friday before his departure why hasn’t he &#8212; I have an inkling, but for the American people &#8212; why hasn’t he signed an executive order on the VRA?&nbsp; That’s the one thing.<br><br>And then, to follow up on the eviction moratorium, for context, there are &#8212; of course, you probably know there is landlord state rentals [sic] &#8212; renters state type of situations.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so, in the state of Florida, it is a landlord state, meaning the law favors landlords.&nbsp; Some of my research has indicated that renters are having a difficult time, in a general sense, and now that they have these tools that they can take advantage of from the government, they are facing more stress and lack &#8212; a lack of cooperation from these landlords.<br><br>I&#8217;ve gotten a lot of that over this past week.&nbsp; I have been following this since a month or so ago &#8212; reporting on this weekly.&nbsp; And what I&#8217;m hearing more and more is that people are afraid that they&#8217;re just not going to get the support because of that lack of cooperation.&nbsp; And I know it&#8217;s been addressed, but what do you think we can do &#8212; or the government can do even further to make sure that these states and local municipalities are cooperating?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, Mona, I think one thing that&#8217;s really important is to make sure that communities understand best practices and that they know how to get this funding out.<br><br>As Gene touched on, there&#8217;s, unfortunately, a dispersed system across the country on how to distribute this funding to renters.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not just &#8212; we&#8217;re not &#8212; the issues in the housing market &#8212; or the hous- &#8212; or keeping renters in their homes is not a new issue; it&#8217;s one that has existed for quite some time, as it sounds like you know well.&nbsp;<br><br>So, one of the things we&#8217;ve done is we&#8217;ve hosted these two summits with 46 of the cities with most tenants at risk to help jurisdictions set up these new eviction prevention programs.&nbsp; And certainly, we want to provide renters with the understanding of what their rights are in this regard &#8212; that this funding can go out until 2025; that this funding is something that the federal government has advocated for because we want people to stay in their homes.<br><br>There&#8217;s no question there&#8217;s more work to be done, but the President advocated for this because he wants to make sure more people can stay in their homes.<br><br>And you&#8217;re asking about the &#8212;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The VRA.&nbsp; Just principally, people want to know: If the President can sign an executive order for transgender rights, for example, why can&#8217;t he find the same power &#8212; does he have the same power to sign an executive order for the VRA?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, he &#8212; the Voting Rights Act?<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, Voting Rights Act.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; First of all, I would say that the &#8212; in order to make change permanent, you need legislation and you need laws passed.&nbsp; And the President is looking forward to and eager to sign voting rights legislation into law.&nbsp; There have been ongoing discussions many of you have reported on, and he&#8217;s going to keep at it.<br><br>He did sign a voting rights executive order early on in the administration &#8212; a historic voting rights &#8212; voting rights executive order, which provided &#8212; which, you know, he wanted to tap into every authority he had from the federal government to protect people&#8217;s rights.&nbsp; But certainly, making laws permanent will protect them longer term.<br><br>I know &#8212; we&#8217;ll have a longer briefing tomorrow.&nbsp; Thanks so much, everyone, for your time.<br><br>3:59 P.M. EDT</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>Today, President Biden is taking further action to prevent Americans from experiencing the heartbreak of eviction. Thanks to State eviction moratoria, almost 33% of the country will be spared evictions for the rest of this month. But in the remaining States, action is needed.</p>



<p>Thanks to the bipartisan COVID relief act Congress passed in December 2020 and the American Rescue Plan Congress and the Biden Administration enacted in March 2021, State and local governments long ago received Emergency Rental Assistance—a $46.5 billion plan to protect millions of Americans facing deep rental debt and potential eviction during the pandemic. Some cities and States have demonstrated their ability to release these funds efficiently to tenants and landlords in need. But even though funds began to be distributed in February by the Biden Administration, too many States and cities have been too slow to act.</p>



<p>As the Administration made clear last week, there is no excuse for any State or locality not to promptly deploy the resources that Congress appropriated to meet the critical need of so many Americans. This assistance provides the funding to pay landlords current and back rent so tenants can remain in their homes or apartments, not be evicted. No one in America should be evicted when Federal funds are available, in the hands of State and local government, to pay back rent due.</p>



<p>Last week the Administration also made clear that given the spread of the Delta variant among those Americans most likely to face eviction and lacking vaccinations, the President would have strongly supported a decision by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to further extend its eviction moratorium to protect renters at this moment of heightened vulnerability. Unfortunately, the Supreme Court declared on June 29<sup>th</sup> that the CDC could not grant such an extension without “clear and specific congressional authorization (via new legislation).”</p>



<p>Given the rising urgency of containing the spread of the Delta variant, on Sunday, the President asked the CDC to consider once again the possibility of executive action. He raised the prospect of a new, 30-day eviction moratorium—focused on counties with High or Substantial case rates—to protect renters. This temporary measure would spur States and localities to ramp up Emergency Rental Assistance programs to full speed this month, giving every landlord the opportunity to collect the rent they are owed and ensuring no eligible family gets evicted.</p>



<p>To date, CDC Director Rochelle Walensky and her team have been unable to find legal authority for a new, targeted eviction moratorium. Our team is redoubling efforts to identify all available legal authorities to provide necessary protections.</p>



<p>In the meantime, the President will continue to do everything in his power to help renters from eviction. The Administration has provided States and local governments with the flexibility to get funds out efficiently without burdensome documentation; to use funds to help those who are homeless or in need of new housing; and to use American Rescue Plan State and local funds to expand any effort to help those whose housing is at risk due to the pandemic.</p>



<p>Today, the President is taking these additional measures:</p>



<ul><li>Directing his White House policy, implementation, and legal teams to assemble all Federal agencies to reexamine whether there are any other authorities to take additional actions to stop evictions.</li><li>Calling on States and localities to extend or put in place evictions moratoria for at the least the next two months. Among those behind on their rent, 1 in 3 renters live in States that have already extended protections against evictions due to State eviction moratoria—which are not covered by the Supreme Court’s ruling. The rest of the States should follow course by also extending eviction moratoria.</li><li>Calling on State and local courts to heed the call of the Justice Department to pause eviction proceedings until tenants and landlords can first seek to access Emergency Rental Assistance—making evictions a last, not first—resort.</li><li>Directing his Cabinet Departments to use their powers to prevent evictions and tell landlords: If your government is backing your mortgage or providing you housing tax relief, you should not be choosing eviction over the Emergency Rental Assistance we have provided to make you whole and keep your tenants and their families safely housed.</li><li>Challenging every landlord to hold off on evictions for the next 30 days and instead seek out the Emergency Rental Assistance Congress and the Administration meant for them.</li><li>Challenging utilities providers to work with State and local governments to access Emergency Rental Assistance and other resources made available by Congress and the Administration to avoid cutting off services for those behind in payments due to the pandemic and at risk of eviction.</li><li>Directing the Treasury Department to make clear that States and localities can use emergency housing and State and local relief to support eviction prevention efforts by courts, legal aid, and housing counselors, as well as to give incentives to landlords who cooperate in these efforts by offering housing to those who have been evicted or are homeless, or by offering leases to the most hard-pressed tenants at a length that ensures true housing stability.</li><li>At the request of Congressional leadership, directing the White House, Treasury Department, and other relevant Federal agencies to continue examining why State and local governments have failed to distribute rental assistance Congress has provided, and explore any authorities the Federal government has to press the States and localities to make these distributions.</li></ul>



<p>The Administration remains deeply committed to doing everything in its power to keep people safely and securely housed, which is essential to the health, well-being, and dignity of us all.</p>

<p>The Administration has taken decisive action to support the safe reopening of schools for in-person instruction and to address <a href="https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/20210608-impacts-of-covid19.pdf">the pandemic’s disparate impact on students of color and other underserved students</a>. As families across the country eagerly anticipate a return to school, the Administration is determined to ensure that our schools and students not only recover from the pandemic, but that we Build Back Better for the future.<br><br><strong><u>Prioritizing safe reopening</u></strong><br><br>The President made clear on <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/21/executive-order-supporting-the-reopening-and-continuing-operation-of-schools-and-early-childhood-education-providers/">Day One of this Administration</a> that safely reopening schools was a national priority, signing the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/21/executive-order-supporting-the-reopening-and-continuing-operation-of-schools-and-early-childhood-education-providers/">Executive Order on Supporting the Reopening and Continuing Operation of Schools and Early Childhood Education Providers,</a> which launched a comprehensive effort across the White House, Department of Education, and Department of Health and Human Services to safely reopen schools for in-person instruction. The Department released two volumes of its COVID-19 Handbook focused on safely reopening schools and meeting the needs of students, and <a href="https://bestpracticesclearinghouse.ed.gov/">launched a clearinghouse</a> of best practices for safely operating in-person and addressing the needs of students and staff. Secretary Cardona’s National Safe School Reopening Summit highlighted best practices from districts across the country to support safe in-person learning.<br><br>Vaccination is our leading strategy to end the pandemic, and—combined with the layered mitigation strategies recommended by the CDC—has the greatest potential to allow schools to reopen fully this fall and stay open for in-person learning. That’s why, in March the President prioritized teachers and school staff for access to the COVID vaccine. As a result, almost 90 percent of educators and school staff are now vaccinated. To get more of our students ages 12 and older vaccinated, the President is now calling on school districts nationwide to host at least one pop-up vaccination clinic over the coming weeks and directing pharmacies in the federal pharmacy program to prioritize this and to work with school districts across the country to host vaccination clinics at schools and colleges.<br><br>Heroic efforts from teachers, parents, and school staff, combined with the Administration’s aggressive vaccination push, has demonstrated that safe in-person learning is possible. <a href="https://ies.ed.gov/schoolsurvey/">Since January, the percentage of K-8 schools offering remote-only instruction decreased from 23 percent in January to only 2 percent in May.</a><br><br>However, there is still work to be done.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7026e2.htm">During the pandemic, students of color have been less likely to be enrolled in in-person instruction</a>. Data shows that on <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/stoken/default+domain/CIGQDAR3XPJUMKYTSTDX/full">average students in remote learning report poorer well-being than those in in-person instruction</a>. A continued reliance on remote learning threatens to further widen disparities. The Administration will continue to address the concerns of families, and provide support to states in creating safe, inclusive, and supportive learning environments.<br><br><strong><u>Investing historic resources in equitable reopening</u></strong><br><br>With the passage of the American Rescue Plan, the Biden-Harris Administration has invested a historic $130 billion to support schools safely reopening and addressing the needs of students, including $122 billion through the <a href="https://oese.ed.gov/offices/american-rescue-plan/american-rescue-plan-elementary-and-secondary-school-emergency-relief/">American Rescue Plan’s Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief Fund</a> (ARP ESSER). ARP ESSER funding supports efforts to get students back in the classroom safely for in-person learning, to safely keep schools open once students are back, and to address the social, emotional, mental health, and academic needs of all students. This funding is being used to help <a href="https://oese.ed.gov/offices/american-rescue-plan/american-rescue-plan-elementary-and-secondary-school-emergency-relief/stateplans/">schools safely operate, implement high-quality summer learning and enrichment programs, hire nurses and counselors, support the vaccination of students and staff, and invest in other measures to take care of students.</a><br><br><strong>Ensuring funds address the needs of students.</strong><em><strong> </strong></em>Districts and states must spend a combined minimum of 25 percent of the state’s total ARP ESSER funds, totaling nearly $30.5 billion, to address the impact of lost instructional time through summer learning or enrichment, extended day instruction, comprehensive afterschool programs, or other evidence-based practices. Funded strategies must also respond to students’ social and emotional needs and account for the disproportionate impact of the coronavirus on underserved students. The Administration recognizes that the communities that support our students have a critical understanding of what their students need and are key to ensuring funds have the greatest impact on students. As they put together their plans for the use of funds, states and school districts are required to engage a wide range of stakeholders during the planning process, including educators, school leaders and staff, students, families, civil rights organizations, and stakeholders representing the interests of students with disabilities, English learners, students experiencing homelessness, children in foster care, migratory students, students who are incarcerated and other underserved students.<br><br><strong>Protecting high-poverty districts from funding cuts.&nbsp;</strong>The American Rescue Plan’s ARP ESSER program includes a first-of-its-kind <a href="https://oese.ed.gov/offices/american-rescue-plan/american-rescue-plan-elementary-and-secondary-school-emergency-relief/resources/">maintenance of equity</a> requirement to ensure that high-poverty school districts and schools are protected in the event of funding cuts. These requirements will ensure that school districts and schools serving a large share of students from low-income backgrounds will not experience disproportionate budget cuts—and that the school districts with the highest poverty levels do not experience any decrease in state per-pupil funding below their pre-pandemic level.<br><br><strong>Ensuring states continue to fund education<em>.&nbsp;</em></strong>The Department has emphasized the importance of the American Rescue Plan’s <a href="https://oese.ed.gov/files/2021/04/MOE-Chart_with-waiver-FAQs_FINAL_4.21.21Update.pdf">maintenance of effort requirement</a>, which ensures that states continue to fulfill their commitments to fund their education systems, and has worked with states to ensure that they meet these requirements. The maintenance of effort requirement helps protect students by making sure that federal pandemic relief funds are used to meet the immediate needs and impacts of the pandemic on students and schools&nbsp;to the greatest extent possible, rather than to supplant general state funding for K-12 education.</p>



<p><strong>Supporting effective implementation.<em> </em></strong>The Department of Education has worked aggressively to support states and school districts in implementing education relief funding. This includes providing <a href="https://oese.ed.gov/offices/american-rescue-plan/american-rescue-plan-elementary-and-secondary-school-emergency-relief/resources/">resources on how ARP ESSER funds can be used</a>, including to <a href="https://www.ed.gov/coronavirus/improving-ventilation">support effective ventilation in schools</a>, <a href="https://oese.ed.gov/files/2021/07/FAQ-21.pdf">vaccination efforts</a>, creating and expand <a href="https://oese.ed.gov/files/2021/07/21-0138-ARP-Community-Schools-OMB-and-OS-Approved-071421-1.pdf">full-service community schools </a>, hiring nurses and counselors, and providing high-quality summer programs and high-dosage tutoring to students. With critical partners like the National Governors Association and Council of Chief State School Officers, the Department launched the <a href="https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-launches-national-summer-learning-enrichment-collaborative-help-students-most-impacted-pandemic">Summer Learning and Enrichment Collaborative</a> to support states providing high-quality summer learning and enrichment.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Stabilizing and ensuring access to child care.<em> </em></strong>High-quality early care and education helps ensure that children can take full advantage of education and training opportunities later in life. The pandemic <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/early-childhood/reports/2020/09/03/489900/true-cost-providing-safe-child-care-coronavirus-pandemic/">significantly disrupted</a> the child care sector, threatening access to this critical support and threatening economic security for childcare workers, who are disproportionately women of color. The American Rescue Plan invested $24 billion in stabilizing the child care sector, and is helping to provide this essential industry—which provides vital opportunities for children—with more flexible funding to help more low-income working families access high-quality care, increase compensation for early childhood workers, and help parents to work. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br><strong><em><br></em>Addressing the needs of students experiencing homelessness. </strong>The pandemic <a href="https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_Housing_insecurity_and_the_COVID-19_pandemic.pdf">increased housing insecurity</a>, and disproportionately impacted the education of students experiencing homelessness, who were less likely to be able to successfully engage in remote learning due to lack of reliable access to the internet. The Department of Education has released all $800 million in American Rescue Plan <a href="https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/education-department-announces-state-allocations-800-million-american-rescue-plan-funds-support-students-experiencing-homelessness">funds for identifying and addressing the needs of students experiencing homelessness</a>, including by providing wraparound services and support ranging from afterschool to mental health services.<br><em><br><strong>Supporting students with disabilities.</strong></em><strong><em> </em></strong>The pandemic created serious challenges for many students with disabilities, who struggled to access special education and related services according to their individualized services plan. The American Rescue Plan provides support to students with disabilities and infants and toddlers with disabilities through the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. To ensure states can deliver the necessary services and supports to young children and youth with disabilities, the American Rescue Plan devotes nearly $2.6 billion in grants to states to support elementary and secondary education students with disabilities, $200 million for preschool children with disabilities, and $250 million for infants and toddlers with disabilities and their families.<br><br><strong>Bolstering Tribal education. </strong>The Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) is using $535 million in American Rescue Plan funds to support 183 BIE-funded K-12 schools, providing much-needed financial support to help Tribal communities recover more quickly from the pandemic’s wide-ranging impact.<br><br><strong>Funding COVID testing.</strong> The American Rescue Plan includes $10 billion to support COVID-19 testing in schools. This funding will help to reopen schools, including in communities of color, which have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Protecting the rights of students.</strong><em><strong>&nbsp;</strong></em>Protecting the rights of students to equal opportunity is an essential part of ensuring educational equity.&nbsp;The Department of Education has provided resources to school leaders, students, families and other stakeholders to ensure students’ rights are protected, including information about&nbsp;<a href="https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/qa-reopening-202105.pdf">civil rights and school reopening</a> and <a href="https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/correspondence/stakeholders/educator-202105-aapi.pdf">confronting COVID-19-related harassment</a> against AAPI students. The Department of Education has moved swiftly to implement the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/03/08/executive-order-on-guaranteeing-an-educational-environment-free-from-discrimination-on-the-basis-of-sex-including-sexual-orientation-or-gender-identity/">President’s Executive Order on Guaranteeing an Educational Environment Free from Discrimination on the Basis of Sex, Including Sexual Orientation or Gender Identity</a>; implement a <a href="https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/correspondence/stakeholders/20210406-titleix-eo-14021.pdf">comprehensive plan</a> to address sexual harassment, including sexual violence, in schools; and make clear that it will enforce Title IX to <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/06/22/2021-13058/enforcement-of-title-ix-of-the-education-amendments-of-1972-with-respect-to-discrimination-based-on">prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity</a>, including for <a href="https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/lgbt.html">LGBTQ+ students</a>. The Department has also worked to address <a href="https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/crdc-exclusionary-school-discipline.pdf">the disproportionately high rates of school discipline for students of color and students with disabilities that removes them from the classroom</a>. The Department held a <a href="https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/conferences/brown-67yl.html">public convening on school discipline</a> in May and launched a major, <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/06/08/2021-11990/request-for-information-regarding-the-nondiscriminatory-administration-of-school-discipline">ongoing effort to address racial, disability-based and other disparities in the administration of school discipline</a>.<br><em><br><strong>Closing the digital divide.</strong> </em>The American Rescue Plan included $7.2 billion for the E-Rate program, which helps support American schools by funding programs to help ensure K-12 students and teachers have the appropriate internet connections and devices for distance learning, a particular challenge in low-income and rural communities.<br><br><strong>Supporting nutrition security.</strong> It is hard for students to learn successfully when they are experiencing hunger. Black and Latino households face food insecurity at <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5823283">twice the rate</a> of white households. The American Rescue Plan <a href="https://www.fns.usda.gov/coronavirus">guards against food hardship</a> among students this summer by allowing states to continue the Pandemic-EBT program, which provides grocery benefits to replace meals for students who are eligible for free and reduced priced meals when schools are closed. It also increases SNAP benefits by 15 percent through September 2021, maintaining the increase through the summer, when <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26203095/">childhood hunger spikes</a> due to a lack of school meals. The U.S. Department of Agriculture likewise acted to offer flexibility for the 2021-2022 school year by providing waivers that allow schools to serve free meals to all students.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>For more information on how President Biden’s Build Back Better agenda builds on this work by investing historic and vitally-needed resources that unlock opportunity for millions of Americans, please see the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/23/fact-sheet-how-the-biden-harris-administration-is-advancing-educational-equity/">White House Fact Sheet on How the Biden-Harris Administration is Advancing Educational Equity</a>.</p>

<p>National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan spoke today with President Kais Saied of Tunisia. In an hour-long discussion, he conveyed President Biden’s strong support for the people of Tunisia and for Tunisian democracy based on fundamental rights, strong institutions, and a commitment to the rule of law. In this spirit, the call focused on the critical need for Tunisian leaders to outline a swift return to Tunisia’s democratic path. National Security Advisor Sullivan underscored that this will require rapidly forming a new government, led by a capable prime minister to stabilize Tunisia’s economy and confront the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as ensuring the timely return of the elected parliament. As Tunisia’s leaders answer the widely expressed demands of Tunisians for improved standards of living and honest governance, the United States and other friends of the Tunisian people stand ready to redouble our efforts to help Tunisia move toward a secure, prosperous, and democratic future.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">James S. Brady Press Briefing Room</p>



<p>2:35 P.M. EDT</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Hello.&nbsp; Here&#8217;s my mask from yesterday.&nbsp; I was wondering where that went.</p>



<p>Good afternoon, everybody.&nbsp; Happy Friday.&nbsp; I have a couple things for all of you at the top.</p>



<p>Today, the President and the Vice President met with governors to discuss the worsening 2021 wildfire season and ongoing efforts to strengthen prevention, preparedness, and response activities.</p>



<p>This was a follow-up to the meeting the President convened last month with Cabinet officials, governors from Western states, and private sector partners.</p>



<p>During today’s event, the President highlighted the heroism of our firefighters who undertake dangerous work to keep Americans safe, and he discussed the actions his administration is taking to improve emergency preparedness and keep Americans safe.</p>



<p>The President and the Vice President then received an update from the governors about the situation on the ground. They discussed what their administration can do to support state and local response efforts and ensure the federal government’s response is as quick and effective as possible.</p>



<p>Driven by extreme heat, prolonged drought, and the changing climate, as well as decades of forest management decisions, the 2021 wildfire season continues to outpace the devastating 2020 season in terms of large fires to date.</p>



<p>Already this year, FEMA has approved 20 Fire Management Assistance Grants to help states pay for the cost of fighting these fires.</p>



<p>The President has been receiving regular reports on how wildfires are impacting communities across the country, and he will continue to close &#8212; to closely monitor the severity of this situation.</p>



<p>Cuba.&nbsp; On the Cuba meeting today that the President is having: Since the historic protests we witnessed in Cuba on July 11, the President has been watching the events closely.&nbsp; As we have stated before, he’s made clear that Cuba is led by a failed and repressive regime and that communism is a universally failed ideology.&nbsp; That’s why, from the start, the President has said that addressing this moment was a priority for the administration.</p>



<p>We have said many times that Cuban-Americans are the best ambassadors for freedom and prosperity in Cuba.&nbsp; As part of that, today the President will host Cuban-American leaders at the White House to discuss the demonstrations and the administration’s response.</p>



<p>In addition, we also announced yesterday that the President is nominating Cuban American Frank Mora to be the next U.S. Ambassador to the Organization of American States, a vital forum where we have and will continue to regularly urge the countries of the hemisphere to support a fundamental freedom &#8212; the fundamental freedoms of the Cuban people.</p>



<p>And I know you love these.&nbsp; This is our vaccination update.&nbsp; They&#8217;re so great.&nbsp; We are always happy to share them with you.</p>



<p>So, today, we recorded over half a million new shots in arms, the highest number since the 1st of July.&nbsp; And the average number of people getting their first shots each day is up 30 percent over the past week alone.&nbsp; And this is the third week that states with the highest cases have the highest vaccination rates.</p>



<p>Every day, Americans are making the choice to get vaccinated.&nbsp; This is an encouraging sign, but we need everyone across the country to have the conversation with someone they know who is unvaccinated about getting the shot.&nbsp; This is how we will stop the spread of the Delta variant and, as we all know, save lives.</p>



<p>Finally, I have a quick preview of the week ahead for all of you.</p>



<p>The next week &#8212; this next coming week, the President will continue engaging with members of Congress to pass the bipartisan infrastructure deal, which will deliver historic infrastructure investments that will drive economic growth and create good-paying, middle-class jobs.</p>



<p>Also next week, the President will meet with Dr. Eric Lander, his Science Advisor and Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, about his plan for preparing for future pandemics.</p>



<p>On Tuesday, the President will deliver remarks on the administration’s progress delivering vaccines to the world to fight this pandemic globally.</p>



<p>On Friday, we will deliver remarks on the July jobs report, as you all know, it&#8217;s the first Friday of the month.</p>



<p>And, lastly, President Biden will then travel to Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, where he will remain over the weekend.</p>



<p>Alex, please take it away.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; So I know we have a hard out at 3:10, so I have a couple quick questions on Congress.&nbsp; First, the eviction moratorium.&nbsp; Lawmakers are scrambling to find a legislative solution, but Speaker Pelosi said today that she&#8217;d like to see the CDC extended.</p>



<p>I know you all have cited the Supreme Court decision as the reason Congress needs to deal with.&nbsp; But why not just extend it, have that legal fight, and give Congress a little bit more room to work?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; So, as &#8212; as we&#8217;ve stated, Alex &#8212; and to your point about Pelosi, you know, the &#8212; the Supreme Court said that it could only be extended with congressional authorization.&nbsp; That was their decision.&nbsp; That&#8217;s how they were able to strike it down, and that&#8217;s what they said needed to happen.</p>



<p>And so, this &#8212; this bill that Pelosi is asking for &#8212; this would meet that requirement if successful.&nbsp; So, this is an important &#8212; important &#8212; it&#8217;s incredibly important to &#8212; to move forward.</p>



<p>And so the administration is working &#8212; is going to work together with leaders in Congress on potential avenues to extend the eviction moratorium to protect these vulnerable renters and their families.&nbsp; We understand how critical that is, how important that is.&nbsp; It has been a lifeline to so many, so many Americans here.</p>



<p>So this is a public health concern, as you can imagine, that we think should be supported by both Republicans and Democrats.&nbsp; So we support the Speaker&#8217;s effort, and we will do everything that we can to move this forward.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, on voting rights, can you tell us any more information about how the President&#8217;s meeting with Schumer and Pelosi on the, sort of, efforts around voting rights went?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Absolutely.&nbsp; Oh, go ahead.&nbsp; I&#8217;m so sorry.&nbsp; Go ahead, Alex.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No, no, no.</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; That was it?&nbsp; Okay, great.</p>



<p>So, as you stated. the President and the Vice President are hosting Speaker Pelosi and Leader Schumer at the White House today, later this afternoon.&nbsp; And this is &#8212; they&#8217;re doing this because they want to make sure that they continue having the conversation on protecting the sacred right to vote because it&#8217;s such incredibly &#8212; it&#8217;s an incredible priority for them.</p>



<p>The President and the Speaker, the &#8212; Leader Schumer are regularly in touch about this, but they wanted to have this meeting in person to talk about the next step.</p>



<p>This is both personal to the President, as we&#8217;ve talked about many times, having fought for voting rights his entire life.&nbsp; He spoke about it in Pennsylvania at &#8212; not too long ago, just a couple of weeks ago.&nbsp; And he&#8217;s going to just continue having those conversations.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, one more on the CDC document that was just leaked.&nbsp; The Washington Post obtained the CDC PowerPoint that suggested the situation surrounding the Delta variant is more dire than, you know, the administration has characterized it.</p>



<p>I wanted to read a few quotes from it.&nbsp; It said, quote, &#8220;Given the higher transmissibility and current vaccine coverage, universal masking is essential to reduce transmission of the Delta variant.&#8221;&nbsp; Delta variant breakthrough infections &#8220;may be as transmissible as unvaccinated cases.&#8221;&nbsp; &#8220;Risk of infection is reduced threefold in the vaccinated population.&#8221;</p>



<p>And so, President Biden has repeated over and over that this is a pandemic of the unvaccinated, but this PowerPoint seems to raise questions about that.</p>



<p>He&#8217;s also promised to level up with the American people.&nbsp; So his comments yesterday &#8212; I mean, was he being completely upfront about the challenges of the Delta variant?&nbsp; This PowerPoint would suggest it&#8217;s a little bit more dire than he laid it out to be.&nbsp; And why wasn’t that PowerPoint made public?&nbsp; Why did it have to be (inaudible) the public?</p>



<p>And then lastly &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wow.</p>



<p>(Laughter.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; I mean, why aren’t we seeing universal &#8212; recommendations for universal masking?&nbsp; Why is it just in areas of high transmission when the CDC seems to be suggesting universal masking is needed?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Okay, Alex.&nbsp; That was a lot.&nbsp; (Laughs.)&nbsp; No, I appreciate the question.&nbsp; It’s actually a very important question, and we need to &#8212; and I’m happy to address all of them.</p>



<p>So, since May &#8212; I just wanted to step back a little bit &#8212; since May, the CDC and the administration have been crystal clear about the increased risk of the Delta variant in our pandemic response.&nbsp; And so I just want to run through a couple of examples because this is such an important moment that we&#8217;re in, in fighting this pandemic.</p>



<p>So, in May, out of the concern of the spread of Delta, we restricted travel to India, where it was growing.&nbsp; That is something that we did in May, and so that &#8212; as you know, that was many months ago at this point &#8212; or a couple months ago at this point.</p>



<p>In the month of June, doctors from the admin blitzed local constituency and national media with over 400 media interviews with a clear message: Delta is a serious threat, and getting vaccinated is the clear solution.&nbsp; So that was in the month of June &#8212; for the month of June.</p>



<p>Throughout June, the President, Jeff Zients, and our medical experts spoke dozens of times to the threat of Delta &#8212; the threat that Delta poses.</p>



<p>On July 4th, the President made clear that COVID-19, quote, “has not been vanquished, and Delta is a powerful variant.&nbsp; This is what the President said on July 4th.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And in light of recent reporting, it is worth noting that Dr. Walensky said eight days ago that the Delta variant is the most infectious respiratory disease she&#8217;s been &#8212; she has seen in the last 20 years &#8212; her 20 years of her career.</p>



<p>Our message has always been clear throughout: We need more people to get vaccinated to stop the spread of this variant, and so we have to continue to make that effort.</p>



<p>Vaccinated and unvaccinated people infected with Delta have higher viral loads, meaning more virus in their body than with previous variants.&nbsp; The last two did not have that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so this is what we&#8217;re seeing in the Delta: High viral loads mean you are more likely to spread it.&nbsp; So, in the rare occasions that vaccinated people get Delta in a breakthrough infection, they may be contagious.&nbsp; And this is what we heard from CDC this week.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so the most important takeaway &#8212; and I want to be really clear about this because this is critical for all of you who report about this and for those who are watching.&nbsp; We should have &#8212; the takeaway is &#8212; we should have from this guidance and any follow-up reporting &#8212; is actually pretty simple: We need more people to get vaccinated.&nbsp; That&#8217;s the answer.&nbsp; We need more people to get vaccinated.&nbsp; That&#8217;s if we want to stop the spread of this variant and avoid mutations, we can.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So we just need to get more people vaccinated.&nbsp; And the good news is that the vaccinations &#8212; the vaccines work, so we got to get out there and make sure people get vaccinated.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karine, the President said, for the early months of this administration, that those who are vaccinated and wearing masks and doing all those steps could look toward the Fourth of July as that independence opportunity.&nbsp; We now know the CDC is basing some of this new science on a Fourth of July party that happened in Massachusetts where the Delta variant was predominant; we saw that vaccinated people were passing it and so forth.</p>



<p>Does this give the President pause about making recommendations about what the public can do?&nbsp; Because he encouraged people who were vaccinated to gather on the Fourth of July.&nbsp; A group that did so is now sort of the poster example for the CDC of what can happen with this variant.</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; I mean &#8212; you know, Kelly O, his &#8212; the President has always said he&#8217;s going to follow the science and he&#8217;s going to listen to public health experts.&nbsp; That&#8217;s what we do, right?&nbsp; That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re &#8212; we are all following the CDC guidance on masking.&nbsp; And so that&#8217;s &#8212; that&#8217;s our North Star, as we &#8212; as Jen has said earlier this week.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Look, the job of all of us in this room is to communicate the truth about where we are in the pandemic, and this is something the President has said from day one, and also highlight how we can get out of this pandemic.</p>



<p>So the vaccines work.&nbsp; That&#8217;s the truth.&nbsp; We know masks work.&nbsp; That&#8217;s the truth.&nbsp; They save lives and prevent spread of this dangerous Delta variant.&nbsp; So we need to help in communicating the actions we are telling the American people to take and getting vaccinated and wearing a mask.&nbsp; If you&#8217;re in an area where there&#8217;s lots of virus circulating, it&#8217;s more contagious.&nbsp; You have to wear a mask.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I know I have one more question that I actually didn&#8217;t get to for Alex that I want to make sure that I answer, which is, will the CDC release more data publicly or this data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So just wanted to say that the CDC’s first and foremost priority is getting the American people information as quickly as possible.&nbsp; And so, that&#8217;s what they did on Tuesday: They got it as quickly as they can.&nbsp; They&#8217;re going to be releasing this data today, as you know.&nbsp; And it was clear that the vacc- &#8212; it was clear that vaccinated people had the ability to transmit an action needed to be taken quickly.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s why they did it.&nbsp; They did it ahead of releasing the data, and they&#8217;re going to do that today, as I just mentioned.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But part of this is also in terms of getting information out.&nbsp; Like, why are the doctors not here in the briefing room to take our questions?&nbsp; Why have we not had a COVID briefing?&nbsp; When we got some update from Dr. Walensky, that was a phone briefing.&nbsp; It provides information, but the public is eager to know more about what the Delta variant can do.</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; You know what, Kelly O?&nbsp; I would &#8212; I would argue that we had the President of the United States speak to this yesterday.&nbsp; He gave a more than 30-minute speech about where we are as a country.&nbsp; I mean, he is a trusted voice; he&#8217;s the leader of our country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But he’s not a scientist.</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; No, but we heard from him, right?&nbsp; We heard from the President yesterday.&nbsp; We heard from the President about the Delta variant and vaccinations, in general, the day before yesterday, when he was in Pennsylvania, when he was supposed to talk about Buy American, which he did, but he led off talking about the vaccinations.</p>



<p>We have had our doctors on your networks, on many of the networks that are here, talking &#8212; probably all of them &#8212; talking about the Delta variant all throughout these last couple of days.&nbsp; So they have been out there.&nbsp; They have been talking about it.&nbsp; And, yeah, we heard from &#8212; directly for Dr. Walensky herself, you know?&nbsp;</p>



<p>So this is something that we&#8217;re going to continue to do.&nbsp; We&#8217;re going to continue to make sure that we communicate directly with the American people and also hand &#8212; work hand in hand with local governments and state governments as well.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Just to follow up on all of that &#8212; you mentioned the CDC’s data that was released on Tuesday.&nbsp; I think the question is: Why doesn&#8217;t that guidance match the internal memos guidance?&nbsp; Because, on Tuesday, they updated the mask guidance to say you only have to wear it in places that have high or moderate transmissibility.&nbsp; The internal memo that was leaked says, “Given higher transmissibility and current coverage” &#8212; vaccine coverage &#8212; “universal masking is essential to reduce transmission.”</p>



<p>So, one, why don&#8217;t the recommendations match?&nbsp; And, two, should the American public anticipate updated guidance that includes universal masking and also new items about large gatherings and how many people should gather, given what we are seeing from Provincetown?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Well, as you know, Weijia, we do not make those types of, you know, decisions from here when it comes to the science, when it comes to guidance.&nbsp; That comes from CDC.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So the questions that you just asked me, I refer you to CDC.&nbsp; About those slides and the &#8212; what you saw in the slides specifically, that comes from them, and they all have that specific, you know, kind of information for you that you&#8217;re trying to get here.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I will say, though, I think the most important thing &#8212; and I don’t want to get away from this because this is what&#8217;s the most critical thing here &#8212; is that people need to get vaccinated.&nbsp; That&#8217;s the answer.&nbsp; If we want to make sure that we curb this pandemic, that we curb this &#8212; the COVID-19, that we fight &#8212; that we win this fight that we&#8217;re in, we have to get people vaccinated.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why the President calls this a pandemic for the unvaccinated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have to make sure that we take care of each other and that they take &#8212; not just take care of themselves, but take care of each other.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re talking about our kids who are 12 and under who can&#8217;t get vaccinated.&nbsp; We&#8217;re talking about our grandparents.&nbsp; Right?&nbsp; We&#8217;re talking about older people in our lives that we want to make sure are taken care of.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so that is &#8212; if anything, that is &#8212; should be one of the main reasons people get vaccinated: to make sure they take care of their families and their community.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Has the White House reviewed CDC&#8217;s internal memo and slides?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; I don’t have anything to say about that.&nbsp; I could look into that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Because the language is &#8212; the analogies are helpful to understand, like, you know, there &#8212; that the Delta variant is as contagious as chickenpox, or more contagious than the common cold or Ebola.&nbsp; Are these things that they&#8217;re going to present to the public to help us understand &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Well, the data is being released today, I believe, right?&nbsp; Right?&nbsp; So, it&#8217;ll be &#8212; it&#8217;ll be available.&nbsp; It&#8217;s being released today.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Got it.</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And one more just follow-up on Kelly.&nbsp; Of all the weeks not to have a COVID briefing, why this week?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; I mean, I know that&#8217;s the question you all are asking me, but they &#8212; the doctors have been on national television all week, speaking to this, answering the questions on your networks.&nbsp; So, they&#8217;ve been out there talking about it.&nbsp; They&#8217;re not hiding.&nbsp; They&#8217;re actually having the conversations with anchors and hosts, and answering the hard questions about the Delta variant, about the CDC masking.&nbsp; And so they&#8217;ve been out there; they&#8217;re not hiding.&nbsp; They&#8217;re actually speaking to this almost every day.</p>



<p>So, you know, and &#8212; and we heard from the President of the United States yesterday for a more than 30-minute speech that many of you were in.&nbsp; So &#8212;</p>



<p>Go ahead, Peter.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Building off of your point that vaccines work, then why is the President asking vaccinated people to mask up if there have been just 0.0035 percent of the 161 million fully vaccinated Americans who have had a breakthrough case?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Let me give you the facts about the Delta variant, and maybe this will help, Peter.&nbsp; It spreads more than twice as easily from one person to another, and it&#8217;s spreading rapidly.&nbsp; It is, really, just across the country, and that is just the fact.</p>



<p>Two months ago, only 1 percent of COVID in the U.S. were Delta.&nbsp; Now, more than 80 percent are Delta.&nbsp; And so this is where we are today with this vaccine, and so it is &#8212; we are listening to the experts, the CDC guidance, and this is what they are telling us.</p>



<p>If you live in an area that has &#8212; that is highly contagious and that has high levels, you have to &#8212; they are saying &#8212; they are, you know, giving the guidance of wearing a mask to protect yourself and to protect your community and your family.&nbsp; That is the guidance that we&#8217;re getting.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And some of the preliminary stuff we&#8217;ve seen from the CDC says this new guidance for vaccinated people to mask up is based on data from people who got sick partying in Provincetown, Massachusetts.&nbsp; Has the White House seen any proof that COVID is spreading &#8212; vaccinated people are spreading COVID who are not going to big parties?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Here&#8217;s what we know, and I&#8217;m just going to repeat again: We need to get people vaccinated.&nbsp; That is really the answer here.&nbsp; That is what we&#8217;re seeing from &#8212; that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re hearing from CDC, that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re even seeing from these slides is that people need to get vaccinated.&nbsp; That is how we fight the Delta &#8212; the Delta variant.&nbsp; That is how we fight COVID.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, last one: The President said yesterday it is “still a question whether the federal government can mandate the whole country” to get vaccinated.&nbsp; He said, “I don&#8217;t know that yet.”&nbsp; Does that mean he has asked the Justice Department to see if it&#8217;s legal to make everybody get a vaccine?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; So, when he said that across &#8212; about the mandate across the country, you know, I would encourage you to read his statement and make sure you read the contents of his remarks.</p>



<p>So, a national vaccine requirement is not under consideration at this time.&nbsp; That&#8217;s where we are with that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But has he asked the Justice Department to see if it&#8217;s even possible?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have any more to add to that.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A lot of questions, obviously, about the super- spreader event in Provincetown.&nbsp; More than 800 cases, but 74 percent of people there fully vaccinated.&nbsp; So doesn’t that at least suggest that maybe breakthrough cases aren’t rare?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; But that’s not what the &#8212; that&#8217;s not what the data shows us.&nbsp; That’s not what we&#8217;ve gotten from CDC. We&#8217;ve been told &#8212; we &#8212; we know that it is the breakthroughs that do happen with vaccinated people are rare.</p>



<p>And so, right now, what the CDC has told us is, because they do know that there are some breakthrough cases, we have to &#8212; we have to make sure we&#8217;re masked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so, again, we just have to continue to make sure people get vaccinated.&nbsp; That is the answer.&nbsp; That&#8217;s how we got to move forward.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re focused on here at the White House.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So we&#8217;re supposed to see that as more of a one-off event, an outlier?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; No, that&#8217;s &#8212; well, I&#8217;m &#8212; what I&#8217;m saying is that what we&#8217;re focused on &#8212; our message is very, very clear &#8212; is that we want to make sure that people get vaccinated.&nbsp; That is &#8212; yes, that is one event, but what the CDC &#8212; that what the CDC guidance tells us is that the breakthroughs have been where &#8212; this is what the public health officials have said.&nbsp; Like, yes, there are breakthroughs, but they have been rare.&nbsp; But the problem is that they are &#8212; it is now contagious.&nbsp; Right?&nbsp; And so that&#8217;s why they&#8217;re asking us to wear a mask.</p>



<p>Where before, with the last two variants that we&#8217;ve seen, we weren&#8217;t seeing that.&nbsp; We weren&#8217;t seeing vaccinated people pass that along.&nbsp; And so, now, that has changed with the Delta variant.&nbsp; That is how serious this variant is.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why our message continues to be: Please, get vaccinated.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the eviction moratorium, Speaker Pelosi, in her statement, said that only $3 billion out of an allocated $46.5 billion has actually going out the door.&nbsp; So what is the administration doing to help get more money out the door faster?</p>



<p><a>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Yeah, so that&#8217;s a good question because that shouldn&#8217;t be happening.&nbsp; Right?&nbsp; We are aware that the monies are taking some time to get to the &#8212; some time from the &#8212; it&#8217;s already out in the states &#8212; some time getting to where the folks who really need it: the renters and lawmakers [landlords].</a></p>



<p>So, what we have done these past couple of days is we made an announcement last week that $1.5 billion of that ERA went out in the month of June, and that was the most that we saw in the last five months.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so, we continue to &#8212; continue to work to make sure that people are being made aware that this is &#8212; this is in existence.</p>



<p>Look, this &#8212; this shouldn&#8217;t be happening.&nbsp; States should be making sure that these monies are getting out as quickly as possible.&nbsp; And so, we &#8212; and just yesterday &#8212; just this week, we had a Day of Action to promote the availability of the rental assistance, which reached tens of millions of Americans.</p>



<p>Last week, the Treasury released new data, which I just mentioned with the $1.5 billion.</p>



<p>And then &#8212; so what we know is that these funds can continue to be dispersed to renters and landlords until 2025. And so these Emergency Rental Assistance are so critical, they&#8217;re so important, and so we&#8217;re making sure that we continue to work with local governments to get that out.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; But I think people are applying.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve heard tens of thousands of people have applied.&nbsp; They&#8217;re just waiting for the funds to be dispersed.</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Yeah, I hear you.&nbsp; And that’s why we&#8217;re encouraging the states to get that out as soon as possible.&nbsp; They have it.&nbsp; They need to get that out.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yeah, go ahead, Jeff.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karine, given the seriousness of the Delta variant, are there conversations in the White House, or between the White House and scientific advisors, about more lockdowns, partial lockdowns, or anything along those lines?</p>



<p><a>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; So that is something that &#8212; you know, I know this was asked to me yesterday.&nbsp; The way we see this is that we have the tools in our toolbelt to fight this &#8212; this variant, to fight this vaccine [virus].&nbsp; </a>And we &#8212; we are not &#8212; we are not going to head towards a lockdown.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We want to make sure that we&#8217;re doing everything that we can because, after passing the historic Rescue Plan, we have the resources to make sure that doesn&#8217;t happen.&nbsp; So our role, again, is to make sure that we get &#8212; that we get people vaccinated as quickly as possible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Look, this vaccine &#8212; these vaccines are free.&nbsp; They&#8217;re easy to get.&nbsp; They’re never been easier to get vaccinated.&nbsp; So that is the number one thing that we&#8217;re trying to do is making that happen.&nbsp; We have the resources to do that.&nbsp; That&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve been able to do this past six months.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve been able to get more than 160 million people fully vaccinated.&nbsp; Eighty percent of that are &#8212; are people who are over the age of 65.&nbsp; And so that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re going to continue to do.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so our goal is to make sure that we are not headed towards that.&nbsp; That is not going to be the direction that we take, because we have the tools to prevent that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You said yesterday that the federal &#8212; new requirements for federal workers could be an example for other employers.&nbsp; Can you just explain: Will federal employees’ data be collected when they submit their vaccination status?&nbsp; And will the federal government be paying for the tests that they take if they do not attest to being vaccinated?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; So, the agencies will pay for the cost of regular federal employee screening tests, so that&#8217;s how that&#8217;s going to move forward.&nbsp; And they&#8217;re going to implement &#8212; the agencies are going to be implementing this program themselves.&nbsp; So, they&#8217;ll be in charge of that &#8212; how that moves forward.&nbsp; And so that&#8217;s kind of how that&#8217;s going to be dispersed &#8212; the program.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And just on another topic, lastly: The New York Times is reporting, and others, that President Trump pressed the Justice Department last year to declare falsely that the election was corrupt.&nbsp; Do you have a reaction &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; to that?&nbsp;&nbsp;And would &#8212; you know, would your Justice Department, the Biden Justice Department, do anything about that?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; So President Biden has been clear that he believes it is absolutely vital to have a Department of Justice that is free from undue political influence, and these revelations underscore why that&#8217;s important.</p>



<p>Go ahead, Phil.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Karine.&nbsp; Just to follow up on MaryAlice’s question: Your number, at least percentage wise, was right, from the CDC study.&nbsp; It says about 74 percent of 346 cases had been fully vaccinated in that cluster.&nbsp; So, just to clarify, it&#8217;s still the belief of the administration and the public health officials that breakthrough cases are rare on that?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; So, what we&#8217;ve been &#8212; what we&#8217;ve been told by CDC and what we know from our public health expert is that they are rare.&nbsp; But here&#8217;s &#8212; I mean, but here&#8217;s the thing, and this is what we keep trying to say, is that: We got to get people vaccinated.&nbsp; That is &#8212; that is what we have to focus on.&nbsp; That is why we&#8217;re seeing the Delta variant.&nbsp; And so that is what we&#8217;re working on as an administration.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That&#8217;s what the President talked about.&nbsp; He talked about incentives.&nbsp; He talked about ways to do this in a more robust way.&nbsp; And this is the way we&#8217;re going to be focused on, is making sure people get vaccinated.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So that actually &#8212; that was my follow-up, which is, you know, very clear that those who are vaccinated see fewer symptoms, hospitalizations, death; there’s no question about it when you look at the data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How concerned are you guys that people see a headline like that about breakthrough cases or a headline from the slide about transmissibility and it undercuts your efforts to say “Vaccination is the answer.&nbsp; Vaccination is the solution”?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Well, I just talked about what we&#8217;ve seen the last couple of days: the rise in numbers of people getting vaccinated.&nbsp; And so, if anything, we&#8217;re seeing people are &#8212; are out there, who are unvaccinated, clearly getting vaccinated.&nbsp; And so that&#8217;s &#8212; that&#8217;s critical.&nbsp; That&#8217;s important.&nbsp; The numbers and the data shows that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re going to continue to do, is making sure that people continue to get vaccinated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You know, we were all being tested every single day.&nbsp; At a certain point, we were not being tested.&nbsp; I&#8217;m curious what the current status of staff &#8212; White House staff testing is,&nbsp;and whether, given this news about transmission, there are plans to ramp up that testing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; So we&#8217;re going to continue to follow the guidance that&#8217;s been laid out, that&#8217;s been &#8212; that&#8217;s been handed.&nbsp; And so all of that is going to be determined &#8212; our testing is going to be determined by the White House Medical Unit.</p>



<p>We continue to get tested here &#8212; the staff does; so does the President.&nbsp; And so that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re going to &#8212; that&#8217;s what &#8212; that&#8217;s &#8212; that&#8217;s how we&#8217;re going to continue to move forward.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So when you say “guidance,” is that &#8212; I think the current guidance is “only if there are symptoms” if you&#8217;re vaccinated.&nbsp; Is that the current status?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Yeah, but we’ve also &#8212; we also have stated in the past, like, when we &#8212; when you’re around &#8212; when a staffer is around the President, they get tested.&nbsp; And because of &#8212; we’re around the President of the United States, we get tested pretty regularly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That&#8217;s something that we have shared in the past.&nbsp; There&#8217;s nothing new there.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re going to continue to follow what the White House Medical Unit entails for us to do as staff and for the President.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the eviction moratorium: Why did the White House wait until yesterday to publicly inform Congress that it was them who needed to extend it legislatively?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; So let me just first say, about the eviction moratorium, because this is, I think, really important:&nbsp;We know that this has a disproportionate effect on those Americans, both most likely to face evictions and lacking vaccinations.&nbsp; And President Biden would have strongly supported a decision by the CDC to further extend this eviction moratorium to protect renters at this &#8212; at this moment of heightened vulnerability.</p>



<p>But like we&#8217;ve all said today, unfortunately, the Supreme Court has made clear that this option is no longer available.&nbsp; So, the Supreme Court&#8217;s ruling stated that clear and specific congressional authorization would be necessary for the CDC to extend the moratorium through July.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, one of the things that I do want to say that we have been doing: We have had this whole-of-government effect to get the word out about the availability of the rental assistance, and to support grantees to ramping up their efforts.&nbsp; And so that is our focus because we know that getting that funding to renters and landlords is incredibly key and important.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So we&#8217;ve been doing that since day one.&nbsp; And now &#8212; what we&#8217;re saying right now, what we have been saying, is that we&#8217;re going to work with Congress to make sure that we&#8217;re able to extend it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We support Speaker Pelosi in her &#8212; in her efforts.&nbsp; And what she is trying to do actually speaks to what the Supreme Court laid out in making sure that there is a continuation of the eviction moratorium.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right, but the Supreme Court ruling was more than a month ago, and you waited until this week to tell Congress that they need to do it.&nbsp; And you effectively jammed them two days before &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; But we&#8217;ve been &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; the moratorium ended.</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; &#8212; we&#8217;ve been &#8212; we&#8217;ve been having conversations with Congress for some time about this.&nbsp; This is something that we have been working with them on some &#8212; with some time about how do we move forward.&nbsp; And so this is &#8212; so this is &#8212; we&#8217;re going to continue to do that.&nbsp; And we appreciate Speaker Pelosi’s efforts.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re going to work closely with her on getting that done.</p>



<p>And, again, from day one, this administration has been working to make sure that we &#8212; we really take care of the most vulnerable in this country who’s been affected by COVID-19.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was some confusion over military service members being mandated to get the vaccine.&nbsp; The President said yesterday it was all about timing and recommended the DOD study it.&nbsp; The DOD later put their own statement out.</p>



<p>What did he mean that it’s all about “timing,” when he also said that the numbers are going to get worse before it gets better?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; So, I&#8217;ll say this: The President is asking the Department of Defense to look into how and when &#8212; and when they will add COVID to the list of mandatory vaccinations for their &#8212; for our armed forces.&nbsp; Anything else, I refer you to the DOD.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For both civilian and military service members?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; I just know it’s the Department of Defense.&nbsp; That&#8217;s who &#8212; that&#8217;s who he&#8217;s &#8212; he&#8217;s been talking to about getting that done.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; And just on a separate note, it was reported this morning that Senator Sinema &#8212; a key Dem swing vote &#8212; said she will be &#8212; not be putting off August vacation plans to vote on your $3.5 trillion reconciliation bill.&nbsp; What&#8217;s your reaction to that?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Look, I know that this has come up, and I just want to be really clear about this and what she actually &#8212; what Sinema actually said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so, you know, I&#8217;m not going to clearly negotiate or anything like that at the podium, but it&#8217;s important to be clear about what the senator said.&nbsp; She is going to vote to proceed with the debate on the budget resolution.&nbsp; She expressed reservations about the topline, which she&#8217;s been clearly clear about, and other senators have said the same.&nbsp; But she is stand &#8212; she&#8217;s not standing in the way of moving this process forward.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Karine.&nbsp; You&#8217;ve been clear that the position of the administration is around the importance of getting vaccinated, but I have a follow-up to Alex&#8217;s question earlier.&nbsp; Because a lot of Americans do not know if they are in an area with substantial or high levels of transmission.&nbsp; So while you are trying to get vaccination rates up, is it the position of the administration that local officials in those affected areas should bring back mask mandates?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Well, local officials are going to look at the vaccination rate in their area, and they have the flexibility to put that into place &#8212; to put mandates into place, as we&#8217;ve seen across the country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That is not our role here as the federal government.&nbsp; We are not mandating mask wearing.&nbsp; We&#8217;re following, again, CDC guidance, and we encourage &#8212; we encourage local governments and states to adhere or to take a look at the guidance and make sure that they keep people safe &#8212; right? &#8212; they keep their community safe and they keep people in their state safe.&nbsp; So that is what we encourage.</p>



<p>And at the same time &#8212; I&#8217;m going to be a broken record on this because this is true, this is the case &#8212; we have to make sure we continue to get people vaccinated.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And a question with respect to Cuba and the ongoing policy review.&nbsp; I know there&#8217;s a meeting today, but has there been any movement on actionable steps?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Specifically, does the President plan to lift travel restrictions between the U.S. and Cuba, and make it easier for Cuban Americans to send money to their relatives on the island, both of which are issues he campaigned on?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Yeah, no, and both important issues that we understand to the Cuban people.&nbsp; So we&#8217;re not going to preview any specific actions here.&nbsp; That is not something that I&#8217;m going to do from the podium.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I will say that on the remit- &#8212; remittances, this is a complex issue that requires coordination with experts that will help to inform the administration&#8217;s policy.&nbsp; So, at the President&#8217;s direction, the Department of Treasury and State will form a remittance working group to review available options to establishing those channels.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karine, may I follow up, please, on Cuba?&nbsp; Right &#8212; right back here.&nbsp; May I follow up on Cuba, please?&nbsp; Thank you so much.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You may have noticed those protests last week across the street from the White House.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know if you or anybody from the White House happened to speak to those protesters, but I did.&nbsp; And it’s anecdotal, of course, but they say they see no difference between the policy of President Biden towards Cuba and the policy of former President Obama towards Cuba.&nbsp; Is the approach the same of those two Presidents &#8212; of President Biden currently and the former President, President Obama?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; So, I&#8217;m going to be really clear here.&nbsp; So, since day one, we have said many times &#8212; many, many times &#8212; that the Cuban Americans are the best ambassadors for freedom and prosperity in Cuba, is what I said at the beginning.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, the President is going to sit down and &#8212; to meet with Cuban Americans, leaders at the White House &#8212; that&#8217;s what he&#8217;s going to do in just a few hours &#8212; to discuss the demonstrations and the administration&#8217;s response.&nbsp; And so &#8212; including applying new sanctions on Cuba &#8212; on Cuban leaders and establishing Internet access for the Cuban people.&nbsp; So, we want to lift up the Cuban people, and that is going to be our focus.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On July 22nd, The Treasury &#8212; the Treasury&#8217;s Office of Foreign Assistant [Assets] Control sanctioned one of the Cuban individuals and one Cuban entity for serious human rights abuses and the repression of peaceful pro-democratic protests in Cuba that began on July 11th.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So we are going to continue to lift up the Cuban American people that &#8212; I&#8217;m sorry, the Cuban people &#8212; and we&#8217;re going to have a conversation.&nbsp; As I just mentioned, the President will have one today, and we&#8217;ll probably have more to read out from that.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karine.</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Go ahead.&nbsp; Go ahead, Jenny.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Karine.&nbsp; Just, really quickly, following up on someone&#8217;s question on the eviction moratorium.&nbsp; You said that you&#8217;ve been working with Congress for some time now.&nbsp; Is there anything you can share in terms of who you&#8217;ve been talking with and when that started?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because Democratic leaders, quite frankly, seem pretty surprised that it&#8217;s now their responsibility.&nbsp; Obviously, we know the Supreme Court decision has been out for a month.&nbsp; So, what can you share in terms of that?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t &#8212; I don’t have specific meetings or conversations to share.&nbsp; Look, I &#8212; what I want to be make &#8212; make really clear is that we are going to cont- &#8212; we&#8217;re going to work with Congress on &#8212; to get this done because we understand the importance of the eviction moratorium to everyday people, especially after what we have seen this past year with COVID-19.&nbsp; That is a priority for us, and we work with Congress on so many different issues and have so many different conversations, and this is going to be a priority.&nbsp; And so, we support what Speaker Pelosi is trying to do now.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you have any response to Congresswoman Ocasio- Cortez calling your handling of the situation “reckless and irresponsible” because you &#8212; the White House hasn’t shown leadership on this before?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; I disagree with the congresswoman.&nbsp; Because, as I stated and I&#8217;ve laid out, from day one, we have been working on the Emergency Rental Assistance.&nbsp; We have been making sure, working with local &#8212; local governments to get those funds out.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just last month, we saw $1.5 billion in just one month in rental assistance that &#8212; which was more than the last five months.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So we have been working very hard in a whole-of-government approach that we do here at this &#8212; at this White House and this administration, and we&#8217;ll continue to do that.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Back to Senator Sinema&#8217;s comments, which you noted, her reservations about the price tag: Do White House negotiators and the President support Senate Democrats scaling back the reconciliation deal?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Look, this is a process that we&#8217;re going through.&nbsp; This is a negotiation process.&nbsp; We&#8217;re going to continue to have &#8212; to engage congressional members on the Hill when it comes to reconciliation, and also, clearly, the bipartisan infrastructure deal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, we&#8217;re not going to &#8212; I&#8217;m not going to stand here and trying to negotiate from the podium; I&#8217;m going to let congressional members do that.&nbsp; We&#8217;ll work closely with them.&nbsp; We understand this is how incredibly critical this is.&nbsp; This is part of a Build Back Better plan that the President has put forward, his economic policy, for this country.&nbsp; And he is all in on this.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He brought people here &#8212; right? &#8212; to work with both sides of the aisles to bring this bipartisan deal on the hard infrastructure, and we&#8217;re going to continue as well with the whole Build Back Better plan.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And back to COVID.&nbsp; I know you said it&#8217;s up to the CDC and health officials to lead on new recommendations.&nbsp; But has the White House or the President asked them to look at new restrictions &#8212; possible restrictions surrounding large group gatherings, given the Delta variant transmission?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; We &#8212; again, we follow the science and we listen to public health officials.&nbsp; That&#8217;s how we move forward with this.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karine &#8212; speaking of the science, Karine &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, switching topics.</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Biden administration, earlier this week, laid out their plan on addressing root causes in Central America, including combating corruption in the region.&nbsp; It comes days after Guatemala’s Special Prosecutor Against Impunity was fired.&nbsp; The State Department has suspended cooperation with Guatemala’s Attorney General.&nbsp; So, I guess, how does this affect the White House&#8217;s work in the region?&nbsp; And does this cause any setbacks?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:Yeah, thank you for the question.&nbsp; Yes, this is something that we are very aware of.&nbsp; So, the situation in Guatemala &#8212; look, it&#8217;s important to us to make sure that &#8212; you know, that &#8212; that corruption is &#8212; as we&#8217;re dealing with the Northern Triangle &#8212; is dealt with.</p>



<p>Hold on.&nbsp; Yeah, I did have something that I wanted to share with all of you if I can find it really quickly.&nbsp; Just give me a second.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t have it with me.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But it&#8217;s something that we&#8217;re aware of.&nbsp; And as you can imagine, as we&#8217;re dealing with the Northern Triangle, as you just stated, it&#8217;s critical and important that when we&#8217;re dealing with these countries and talking about how we&#8217;re going to help them with the root causes; that corruption, you know, is not is &#8212; is something that doesn&#8217;t affect the process that we&#8217;re trying to make.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, you know, when we &#8212; when we do deal with the Northern Triangle countries, it&#8217;s not giving money directly to the government, it&#8217;s working as well with the organizations on the ground.&nbsp; So that is also critical and important.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so, we&#8217;re going to keep an eye on that.&nbsp; We&#8217;re going to stay focused on that as well.&nbsp; And we should have more to share on the Guatemala situation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karine &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You have the person.</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Oh, my gosh.&nbsp; I totally forgot.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Oh, my goodness.&nbsp; Give me one second.&nbsp; Our Fun Friday.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Okay, for our last question for our Fun Friday Zoom, a reporter hailing from Black Information Network, Vanessa. Vanessa.&nbsp; Hey, Vanessa Tyler.&nbsp; How are you?</p>



<p>(Reporter via Zoom denoted in <em>italics</em> is only heard via livestream. Audio is not played in the Press Briefing Room.)</p>



<p><em>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, Karine.&nbsp; Thank you so much for taking my question.</em></p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Oh, we cannot hear you.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you hear me?</em></p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Can&#8217;t hear you, Vanessa.</p>



<p><em>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you hear me?&nbsp; Hello?</em></p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have questions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; I know.&nbsp; There are questions in the room, for sure.</p>



<p><em>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you hear me now?</em></p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One more question.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karine, how do you test if that is the Delta variant &#8212; that COVID is the Delta variant?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t understand the question.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, how do you test, when that is the dominant strain in the area &#8212; when people just test whether they&#8217;re COVID positive or &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Well, we don&#8217;t &#8212; we don&#8217;t &#8212; we don&#8217;t test the &#8212; we don’t test it.&nbsp; We listen to public health and scientists, and they tell us that it&#8217;s the Delta variant.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have they explained their process on that?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t even understand, why would they explain &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was saying, how do they explain their process and how they&#8217;re determining it&#8217;s the Delta variant?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; I mean, that&#8217;s what they are telling us.&nbsp; I laid out why &#8212; why they &#8212; I laid out how contagious it was and I laid out why we needed to act on the Delta variant.&nbsp; I laid out &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I get that, but a lot of what &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; &#8212; what I &#8212;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; the answers we get is, “Because they say so,&#8221; without a lot of (inaudible).</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Well, they&#8217;re the experts.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not just “they.”&nbsp; These are scientists.&nbsp; These are experts.&nbsp; I just said that &#8212;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know, but they&#8217;ve contradicted &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Hold on one second.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; themselves &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; I &#8212; hold on one second.&nbsp; I just said that Dr. Walensky said just recently, in her 20-year career, she had never seen a variant that was so contagious.&nbsp; So, this is 20 years of her career.&nbsp; So this is absolutely, absolutely a major, major problem that we are trying to deal with.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That&#8217;s why we heard from the President yesterday.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why we keep talking about people need to get vaccinated.&nbsp; So, that is &#8212; that is the &#8212; that is the way that we&#8217;re trying to move in this administration: making sure that we are protecting people here, making sure that we&#8217;re dealing with this pandemic in a way that is effective.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s how we&#8217;re going to move forward.&nbsp;</p>



<p>(Cross-talk from reporters.)</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; I&#8217;ll take another question.&nbsp; Go ahead.&nbsp; Go ahead.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The question is &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Go ahead, Eugene.&nbsp; Go ahead, Eugene.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In April, the Chief of Staff told Playbook that the Education Department was reviewing whether the President could forgive student debt, and that review would be done in a matter of weeks, rather than a matter of months.&nbsp; I&#8217;m just wondering where that review stands.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; So, this is the student &#8212; the student &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Student debt relief.&nbsp; So, the President is signing away $10,000 or $50,000, which is a big ask for (inaudible).</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; So I think we&#8217;ve been &#8212; you know, the President, as you know, supports Congress providing $10,000 in student relief &#8212; in debt relief, and he continues to look into what the debt relief actions can be taken administratively.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have an update on that at all right now, at this moment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Look, the Department of Education is working in partnership with colleagues at the Department of Justice and the White House to review options with respect to debt cancellation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so, again, I don&#8217;t &#8212; I don&#8217;t have any update.</p>



<p>(Cross-talk from reporters.)</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Afghanistan &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a question on &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; We&#8217;re going to have to wrap up.&nbsp; We&#8217;re going to have to wrap up, guys.&nbsp; We&#8217;re going to have to wrap up.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thank you so much.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did she ever get to ask?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Thank you, everybody.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What about the (inaudible) reporter?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Oh, my gosh.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Can we hear you now?&nbsp; We still can’t hear you?</p>



<p>(Audio does not play in the room.)</p>



<p><em>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you hear me now?</em></p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; I&#8217;m so sorry.&nbsp; Are you on mute?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No, she&#8217;s not.</p>



<p><em>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I’m not on mute, no.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah, it&#8217;s something in the room.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Okay, so we&#8217;re &#8212; we&#8217;re trying to &#8212; we&#8217;re trying to hear you and we cannot.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Vanessa, I&#8217;m so sorry.&nbsp; I&#8217;m so sorry.&nbsp; Do you want to write a note?&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Let us know what your questions is?&nbsp;</p>



<p>All right.&nbsp; All right, Vanessa, we&#8217;ll try next Friday.</p>



<p><em>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay, thank you.&nbsp; Yeah, next Friday will be fine.&nbsp; I can hear you.&nbsp; I can hear you perfectly.&nbsp; I can hear you, and I understand &#8212;&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; All right, guys.&nbsp; Vanessa, we’ll see you &#8212; we’ll try and do it next week.&nbsp;</p>
