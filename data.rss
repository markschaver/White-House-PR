<p class="has-text-align-center">Via Teleconference<br>(May 11, 2022)</p>



<p>6:06 P.M. EDT</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Good evening.&nbsp; And thank you for joining our background call previewing tomorrow&#8217;s Global COVID Summit.&nbsp; This call will be held on background, attributable to a “senior administration official.”&nbsp; And it will now be embargoed until 7:00 a.m. tomorrow, May 12th.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For your awareness, not for your reporting, the officials on this call are [senior administration official] and [senior administration official].&nbsp;</p>



<p>With that, I will pass it off to [senior administration official].  Thank you.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Welcome, everyone.&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; Thanks so much for taking the time today to join us.&nbsp; I’m &#8212; our office’s mission is to coordinate across the government to prevent, detect, and respond to pandemic and infectious disease threats that face America and the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And today, we want to brief you on the sum- &#8212; on the Global COVID Summit that the United States will cohost tomorrow.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As you know, the United States has delivered over 500 million doses of vaccines to over 100 countries as part of the 1.2 billion doses committed by the United States at the last summit in September.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The U.S. has also led the world in COVID-19 funding, committing over $19 billion in funding to date in vaccinations, tests, treatments, oxygen, and humanitarian assistance.&nbsp; And we&#8217;ve partnered with countries to improve their capacity to make their own vaccines.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This has truly been an unprecedented public health effort to save lives around the world and keep Americans safe from the next variant.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On Thursday, the United States will continue our leadership globally by cohosting the Global COVID-19 Summit with Belize, which is serving as the CARICOM chair, with Germany as the G7 presidency, with Indonesia as the G20 presidency, and Senegal as the Africa Union chair.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have made great progress since the last summit, but the pandemic is not over.&nbsp; And now is the time to continue to respond and also prepare for the next variant and the next pandemic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The overarching purpose of the summit are really twofold.&nbsp; One is to redouble our efforts to control COVID-19.&nbsp; And the second is to ensure the world is prepared for the next one &#8212; the next pandemic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We will be joined by partners from around the world, including governments, multilateral organizations, philanthropies, businesses, and civil society leaders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And there are really three priorities: &nbsp;</p>



<p>First, we want to prevent complacency.&nbsp; The pandemic is not over.&nbsp; We have the need to continue to address new subvariants, which continue to emerge, slowing vaccinations.&nbsp; We need funding both at home and from countries and other stakeholders to get more shots into arms and other vital lifesaving resources to the world.&nbsp; So the summit will focus on securing new resources and policy commitments to control COVID in 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Second, we want to prevent deaths, and that means focusing on the most vulnerable.&nbsp; Since January of 2021, when deaths were at their highest around the world and a seven-day average of 14,000 deaths a day &#8212; now they&#8217;re down to about 2,000 deaths per day.&nbsp; That is some progress that countries around the world have contributed to, health workers have contributed to, but we still have more to do.&nbsp; Two thousand deaths a day is still too many.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The summit will focus on getting vaccines, tests, and treatments to those at highest risk, like the elderly, the immunocompromised, and frontline and health &#8212; and other health workers around the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We do have the tools to control COVID &#8212; vaccines, tests, and now new antiviral medicines &#8212; but medical breakthroughs are not enough.&nbsp; We need more funds to hire vaccinators to support vaccination sites, to support fridges to store vaccines, to support fuel to &#8212; for vehicles to deliver vaccines to people out of reach.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We also need new funding to purchase new treatments and expand test and treatment strategies like we&#8217;ve done for HIV/AIDS and malaria, and like we&#8217;re doing for COVID here in America.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The third thing we want to do is to prevent future variants and pandemics.&nbsp; Delta and Omicron emerged in other parts of the world before they reached America.&nbsp; The next pathogen is also likely to emerge in another part of the world.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s not a matter of “if,” but “when.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The truth is we&#8217;ve learned we can stop outbreaks at their source by investing in the capacities of countries to carry out surveillance and detect the next variant and threat; to develop and manufacture medicines, vaccines, and test locally; and to equip local health workers, clinics, and hospitals to ensure that those lifesaving measures reach people who need them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To do that, the summit will call for countries to invest in the new Global Pandemic Preparedness and Health Security fund at the World Bank.</p>



<p>This is not a talk-the-talk summit, it&#8217;s a walk-the-walk summit.&nbsp; In advance of the summit, we&#8217;ve called on leaders of governments, civil society, businesses, and philanthropy to make significant new commitments to get shots into arms, expand access to tests and treatments, and enhance health security, and prevent future variants and pandemics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We are doing our part in this effort by securing funding to embark on responding to this pandemic, to continue to respond to it in an unprecedented fashion.&nbsp; We are doing our part by convening the world around a coordinated effort, an urgent effort to save lives.&nbsp; Other countries are doing their part by providing new resources.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the hard-fought progress we&#8217;ve made and the momentum we have is at serious risk without congressional action.&nbsp; Countries are declining our doses because they don&#8217;t have the resources they need to get shots into arms, whether they’d be fridges to store the doses or information campaigns to combat hesitancy.</p>



<p>The President, as you know, has requested $22.5 billion in emergency funding to continue our COVID response.&nbsp; That includes $5 billion that will ensure the continuation of our vital, proven work to get shots into arms globally and to expand access to therapeutics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tomorrow, you will hear a loud call from the United States for Congress to act with the urgency that this virus warrants.&nbsp; We know the virus is not waiting for Congress to act, so we need urgent, urgent action, not empty words.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I&#8217;m going to turn it now to my colleague, [senior administration official], who will give you a sense of what to expect at the summit tomorrow.&nbsp;</p>



<p>[Senior administration official], over to you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Hi, everyone.&nbsp; So what will we see tomorrow at the summit?&nbsp; First, you&#8217;ll see that countries and the private sector stepped up.&nbsp; The summit includes leaders from all over the world, as you can see from the advisory that we released yesterday.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During the summit, the U.S. will join the four cohost countries &#8212; again, those are Senegal, Germany, Indonesia, and Belize &#8212; to kick off this summit.</p>



<p>And then at least 10 world leaders and heads of state will speak, as well as at least a notable &#8212; many notable govern- &#8212;&nbsp; non-governmental speakers will speak throughout the summit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vice President Harris will also join world leaders during Thursday&#8217;s COVID Summit.&nbsp; She’ll give remarks on the devastating impacts of COVID on Americans and the steps we&#8217;re taking to manage the threat of new variants.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She’ll also call on the international community to continue to step up and take action to manage the current threat and prepare for future threats.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The U.S. government is bringing the full force of its power to bear.&nbsp; Secretary of State Blinken, Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield, Secretary of Health and Human Services Becerra, USAID Administrator Power, G7 and G20 Sherpa and Deputy National Security Advisor Daleep Singh, and COVID Response Coordinator Ashish Jha will all be participating tomorrow.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The opening session will be followed by three sessions that focus on major challenges that we face in moving from COVID-19 as an emergency to COVID-19 &#8212; eventually &#8212; as a controllable respiratory disease, and to a world that is truly prepared for the biological risks that we face and that are growing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These sessions include focusing on getting vaccines to the world and particularly to the most vulnerable, saving lives by expanding access to tests and treatments, and presen- &#8212; preventing future catastrophes by investing now in health security capacity and workforce.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To date, the summit has leveraged in new money more than $3.1 billion in commitments.&nbsp; These are additional to what has been raised at other points in 2022.&nbsp; They are on top of existing commitments.&nbsp; That’s $3.1 billion.&nbsp; That would not have happened without U.S. leadership.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But if the U.S. is to remain a leader protecting Americans and the world from dangerous disease threats, we need Congress to act now to provide more funding for the COVID response.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As [senior administration official] said, there&#8217;s a lot of chatter about what the U.S. is or isn&#8217;t bringing to the summit.&nbsp; It&#8217;s clear what we&#8217;re bringing: We&#8217;re bringing leadership and over $3.1 billion in leverage commitments that wouldn&#8217;t have arisen without us convening this summit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We come to this summit as the leader in the global COVID response.&nbsp; We’ve pioneered an unprecedented and urgent effort to navigate getting over half a billion lifesaving doses to hundreds of countries around the world with no strings attached.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re the first country to buy doses for the sole purpose of donations &#8212; not a small amount, a billion of them.&nbsp; And we&#8217;ve provided billions in funding for the “last mile” to work to get shots into arms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That didn&#8217;t happen overnight, and it didn&#8217;t happen by accident.&nbsp; It happened because countries and organizations want to step up to the United States and for the administration &#8212; because he has been a leader in this response, President Biden, from day one.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This week, you&#8217;re going to see important commitments of all types.&nbsp; You&#8217;ll see major countries and regional bodies.&nbsp; You&#8217;ll see Canada.&nbsp; You&#8217;ll see the European Commission.&nbsp; You&#8217;ll see the Republic of Korea.&nbsp; You&#8217;ll see Spain and France contributing hundreds of millions of new dollars to get shots into arms.&nbsp; And relatedly, you&#8217;ll see low-income countries committing to accelerations to vaccinate their most vulnerable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You&#8217;ll see political and substantial financial commitments to establish a new Health Security and Pandemic Preparedness fund at the World Bank so that it can stand up this summer.&nbsp; This is something the administration has personally championed.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve been ab- &#8212; we have to be able to walk and chew gum at the same time by preparing now, because the next pandemic could come at any time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And you&#8217;ll also see commitments from companies to look at setting lower prices for treatments and tests, to work with governments and international organizations to expand access for those most at risk &#8212; country by country, community by community.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And finally, you’ll see commitments to help provide facts to overcome the dis- and misinformation which has plagued &#8212; pardon the pun &#8212; this pandemic.</p>



<p>You’ll see companies and other groups stepping up in some really creative ways.&nbsp; We’ve been really heartened by the responses that we’ve gotten from all over the world.&nbsp; This is the power of the United States convening power.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But we’re also digging deep ourselves.&nbsp; So, in terms of what we’re bringing to the table:</p>



<p>We will be providing additional funding for the Global Health Security and Pandemic Preparedness fund at the World Bank.&nbsp; Building on our initial seed pledge of $250 million to establish that fund, we’ll be increasing our pledge by an additional $200 million, for a total of $450 million.&nbsp; The fund will provide sustained financing for improving local, national, and global capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to pandemics and other disease or infectious disease threats.</p>



<p>There is now a strong global consensus to establish this new Pandemic Preparedness and Global Health Security fund at the World Bank.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You may have seen several weeks ago that Indonesia, the G20 president, issued a strong statement from finance ministers signaling political consensus and directing those next steps for this fund to the World Bank and the WHO.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Secretary of the Treasury Yellen, WHO Director-General Tedros, and others have been very publicly vocal about amplifying why this fund is critical to lessen or prevent the next pandemic as part of the overarching reforms of the global health architecture.</p>



<p>Last week, the World Bank sent a memo to their board noting the concept of this is, in its own words, “opening for business by September of 2022.”</p>



<p>We’re also pleased to announce this week that the United States National Institutes of Health licensed 11 COVID-19 research tools and early-stage vaccine and diagnostic candidates to the Medicines Patent Pool under the World Health Organization COVID-19 Technology Access Pool.&nbsp; This includes licensing the NIH stabilized spike protein technology, which is a key component included in multiple existing COVID-19 vaccines. These licenses will enable manufacturers from all over the world to develop vaccines, treatments, and diagnostics for COVID-19 using these technologies, and to distribute them to low- and middle-income countries.</p>



<p>In addition to this important step taken by the NIH, the FDA is also committed to doing its part to facilitate greater global access to these lifesaving products, including through a rapid review of generic products for the global COVID response.</p>



<p>Through the FDA, we confirm our commitment to conduct thorough and efficient reviews of COVID-19 response products.&nbsp; While COVID-19 remains a public health emergency, FDA will prioritize the review of these COVID-19 therapeutics, including applications seeking tentative approval of generic products.&nbsp;</p>



<p>FDA grants tentative approvals for products that meet the requirements for FDA approval but cannot be approved for exclusivity or patent reasons.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Finally, the United States also will pilot test-and-treat strategies for the most vulnerable populations in low- and middle-income countries to help prevent deaths from COVID-19.&nbsp; The U.S. Agency for International Development will use $20 million in order to provide technical assistance and service delivery in up to eight countries to support rapid deployment of tests and treatments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This will leverage $80 million from the global fund that they will use to procure rapid test kits and oral COVID-19 antiviral drugs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It will build on an additional $22 million from Unitaid to provide &#8212; to produce over $120 million in investments to introduce test-and-treatment strategies in over 20 countries in 2022.&nbsp; This collaborative early investment will catalyze test-and-treat adoption and expansion in additional countries.</p>



<p>And this commitment to pilot test-and-treat activities is a down payment on U.S. leadership that can be fully realized if Congress acts to provide the President’s requested COVID-19 supplemental funding.</p>



<p>Despite these commitments to combat COVID-19 and to enhance future preparedness against health threats &#8212; I just want to end by underscoring: Our progress and momentum against COVID-19 is at serious risk without congressional action.&nbsp; We continue to urge the Congress to act promptly to provide supplemental resources.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Without additional emergency COVID-19 funding, the United States will be unable to purchase additional lifesaving treatments for the American people, the United States will be less able to stop the spread of dangerous new variants from around the world, and the United States will be unable to keep vaccinating the world against COVID-19 and getting shots in arms to save lives here, at home, and abroad.</p>



<p>Again, we’re grateful to the world for stepping up at this summit and this critical moment, and we’re optimistic that the commitments that we and others are making will save lives and better prepare us for future threats.</p>



<p>With that, I’ll turn it back over to [senior administration official].&nbsp;</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Thank you, [senior administration officials].&nbsp; Moderator, would you mind giving directions again on how to ask questions?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you so much for doing this.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t see the other two major global vaccine developers on the list of attendees.&nbsp; Were Russia and China invited by the U.S. or any of the other hosts, or did they decline?&nbsp; Or is there a reason that they&#8217;re not involved in this?&nbsp; And how does that affect your ability to reach more people on the globe?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Anita, thank you.&nbsp; We &#8212; in terms of whether Russia was invited: No, we did not extend a commitment ask to them.&nbsp; And with other countries, we have extended and asked for a financial or policy commitment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Your second part of your question was: “How does that affect our efforts to lead the world and for the global response?”&nbsp; Well, you know, I think you&#8217;ll &#8212; you heard from my colleague that we&#8217;re finding amongst the countries, the companies, the philanthropies, and the nonprofits that have committed to this effort that we&#8217;ve mobilized $3.1 billion of financing towards the global fight.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, it&#8217;s clear other countries are stepping up to do their part.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The administration is stepping up to do its part by virtue of cohosting this, by virtue of continuing to lead with the $19 billion of financing provided to us through the American Rescue Plan.&nbsp; And the fight is not done.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so now we really need Congress &#8212; specifically Republicans in Congress &#8212; to show up not with empty words, but with action, and to act on securing and enacting the supplemental while lives remain at risk here and around the world.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, thanks for holding this call.&nbsp; You said the Vice President will be participating.&nbsp; Is President Biden playing any role in this in any form?&nbsp; And can you give us any sense of conversations he&#8217;s had with some of these leaders in an effort to sort of engage them in adding value to the sum that you&#8217;re trying to collect?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Thanks, Peter, for your question.&nbsp; The Vice President will join leaders in the headline session at tomorrow&#8217;s summit.&nbsp; She&#8217;ll give remarks on the devastating impact of COVID on Americans and the steps that we&#8217;re taking to manage threats of new variants.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And that&#8217;s what this is partly about.&nbsp; It&#8217;s about saving lives abroad.&nbsp; But we also know new variants come from &#8212; have come from abroad, and this is about stopping those because that will also ensure the gains we&#8217;ve made in this country are protected and American lives are saved, and that businesses and schools continue to not be disrupted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The President will address participants, and he will have a resounding commitment to ensuring that the goals of the summit &#8212; to prevent complacency, to prevent deaths, and to prevent future variants and pandemics &#8212; are front and center.&nbsp; His team has been engaged with the teams of the other cohosts all the way up to their presidencies.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve been meeting almost every other day, if not every day, to plan this together.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so, you know, this summit &#8212; the commitment here and the progress we&#8217;ve made overall just wouldn&#8217;t be happening without the leadership of both the President, the Vice President, and several members &#8212; as you heard &#8212; of the Cabinet that are going to be speaking tomorrow.</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Thank you, [senior administration official].&nbsp; And thank you, everyone, again, for joining our call.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Again, this call is now embargoed until 7:00 a.m. tomorrow, May 12th, and it’s on background, attributable to a “senior administration official.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Also, for planning purposes only, the summit is scheduled to start at 9:00 a.m. tomorrow.&nbsp; And you can look at our advisory for the livestream link.&nbsp; And it will kick off with the President&#8217;s remarks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thanks to all.</p>



<p>6:27 P.M. EDT</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>South Court Auditorium<br><em>Eisenhower Executive Office Building</em></em></p>



<p>9:36 A.M. EDT<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Thank you, Madam Ambassador.&nbsp; And thank you, all of you, for co-hosting this very important convening: Prime Minister Briceño; the President, of course, Sall of Senegal; and Chancellor Scholz; and President Widodo.&nbsp; Thank you all.&nbsp; And I also see my friend, Prime Minister Trudeau.&nbsp; And, President Sánchez, I want to thank you as well and everyone who is here with us today.<br>&nbsp;<br>Today marks a solemn milestone for us in the United States: the loss of one million American lives due to COVID-19.&nbsp; One million lives.<br>&nbsp;<br>Today and every day, we remember them, of course, and we honor them.&nbsp; And I send my prayers to their loved ones.&nbsp; And I recognize all the pain that has been endured by them and those who have lost loved ones around the world.&nbsp;<br><br>I believe we owe it to their memories and to the millions of other lives lost around the world to renew our fight against this deadly virus, which brings me to why, of course, we are all gathered here today.<br>&nbsp;<br>Over the last two years, as we all know, COVID has had a devastating impact on people around the globe: economic shocks, a massive disruption to so many parts of our daily lives.<br>&nbsp;<br>And of course, yes, we have made remarkable progress.&nbsp; Yet without continued action, lives and livelihoods will continue to be at risk.&nbsp; This is why our administration is hard at work in Washington, D.C., doing everything we can.<br>&nbsp;<br>As you heard just a moment ago from President Joe Biden, there are a number of ways in which we have and will continue to take action.<br>&nbsp;<br>We have called upon the United States Congress for $22.5 billion dollars in additional emergency funding to battle COVID. &nbsp;Five billion dollars of that would be dedicated to continue our leadership in helping to save lives around the world.&nbsp;<br><br>We will continue to advocate for these lifesaving resources as part of our global commitment.<br>&nbsp;<br>All of you in this headliners session have also taken very important steps and have made key commitments, and we thank you.<br>&nbsp;<br>In our collective words and actions, we are all making clear complacency is not an option.<br>&nbsp;<br>As we gather today, our goals are twofold: One, we must continue to respond to the threat.&nbsp; And two, we must prepare for the future.<br>&nbsp;<br>As long as the COVID virus is present in one country, it impacts all of us.<br>&nbsp;<br>This pandemic, of course, knows no borders, and we must continue to work together to find solutions.<br>&nbsp;<br>We still &#8212; as has been said, we still need to make vaccines, tests, and new treatments accessible to all and especially to those who are highest at risk: the elderly, the immunocompromised, and healthcare workers.<br>&nbsp;<br>I am also aware that countries throughout the world need more training for doctors and nurses and community health workers; and more technical assistance, including freezers, to help get shots in arms.&nbsp; We look forward to partnering with all of you on this.<br>&nbsp;<br>We must also keep an eye to the future.&nbsp; We have learned key lessons in the past two years &#8212; lessons about the importance of early detection and surveillance; the need to leverage the private sector and non-profits to scale production of medicines and tests and vaccines; the transformative power of investments in health systems and health workers; the complicated mechanics of donating and distributing hundreds of millions of vaccines around the world; and the lifesaving benefits of a global health security fund.<br>&nbsp;<br>Last year, at this very summit, we discussed this particular lesson.&nbsp; And you’ll recall I urged us to work together to develop a new financing system and mechanism.<br>&nbsp;<br>Thanks to President Widodo and Prime Minister Draghi, through the G20, we have consensus to establish this fund.&nbsp; And I know we all know and have said it will help us on very critical issues like early detection and warning systems, and investments in rapid recovery and response.&nbsp; And this is just the beginning.<br>&nbsp;<br>The way I see it is this: As we think about moving forward, I believe we can also come together &#8212; in addition to everything we have discussed &#8212; come together to shape new international norms on these issues.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Together, we can establish common understandings that guide our collective action: that all countries, regardless of GDP, should have access to lifesaving vaccines, tests, and therapeutics; that nations should be transparent and share information early and often; that leaders should prioritize the most vulnerable and the overlooked; and that we must recognize and address inequities in our systems.<br>&nbsp;<br>The future, of course, will present other global health crises, but they don’t have to become catastrophes if we do this work together.<br>&nbsp;<br>Now is the time, we know, for bold thinking and concrete action.&nbsp; And I look forward to this discussion and continuing discussions, and the work we will do together to shape the future of global health and health security around the world.<br>&nbsp;<br>Thank you all.<br>&nbsp;<br>END&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

EDT</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Preventing Complacency and Prioritizing Preparedness</em></p>



<p>Today, the United States, Belize, Germany, Indonesia, and Senegal convened other heads of state and world leaders from international organizations, the private sector, philanthropies, non-government organizations, and other partners for the 2nd Global COVID-19 Summit. &nbsp;<br><br>The United States issued a call to redouble global efforts to control the COVID-19 pandemic and prepare for future health emergencies.&nbsp; The U.S. &nbsp;urged the world to prevent complacency and to keep political will strong. We also called on leaders to accelerate financial and policy commitments – country by country, community by community – to get shots into arms; expand access to tests and treatments; protect those at highest risk; and prevent future catastrophes by building and financing country capacity, health workers, disease surveillance, and medical countermeasures, including through the new health security fund at the World Bank<strong>.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Vice President Harris highlighted U.S. leadership and called on Congress to </strong><strong>continue to make Americans and the world safer by promptly providing the $22.5 billion in supplemental funding for responding to COVID-19 that the Administration requested on March 2, 2022, <u>including $5 billion to support the global effort</u> to stop the spread of potential new variants, get shots into arms, expand access to tests and treatments, and save lives here at home and abroad.</strong></p>



<p>U.S. leadership in vaccinating the world, saving lives, and building better health security</p>



<p>This Summit continues to highlight American leadership in the global COVID-19 response. &nbsp;As the world’s largest donor, the United States has to date provided more than $19 billion in health, humanitarian, and economic assistance and has committed to provide 1.2 billon vaccine doses to the world for free, of which we have already provided more than 535 million doses.</p>



<p>At the Summit, the United States called the world to action alongside co-hosts Belize, Germany, Indonesia, and Senegal. &nbsp;Leaders from around the world made bold new commitments to control COVID-19 and prevent future health crises.&nbsp; The U.S. announced new commitments to the global COVID-19 response and pandemic preparedness, building on substantial U.S. commitments made to date and during the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/09/22/fact-sheet-president-bidens-global-covid-19-summit-ending-the-pandemic-and-building-back-better/">last global COVID-19 Summit</a>:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Additional funding for a pandemic preparedness [and global health security] fund housed at the World Bank.&nbsp; </strong>Building on its initial commitment of $250 million previously announced at the first Global COVID-19 Summit, the United States intends to increase its initial contribution toward the establishment of the new pandemic preparedness and global health security fund at the World Bank by an additional $200 million, for a total of $450 million. Combined with funding pledged today by other donors, this funding makes a total of at least $960 million in seed funding in advance of the Fund’s launch this summer.&nbsp; The Fund will provide sustained financing for improving national, regional, and global capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to pandemics and other infectious disease threats.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Sharing U.S. Government COVID-19 vaccine-related intellectual property and research tools for greater global access. </strong>Through the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the United States has recently licensed research tools and the intellectual property for several COVID-19 technologies to the Medicines Patent Pool, through the WHO COVID-19 Technology Access Pool. The licenses include the patent for the stabilized spike protein used in multiple existing COVID-19 vaccines. These licenses will enable manufacturers from around the world to use these technologies.</li></ul>



<ul><li>The United States, through the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), confirms its commitment to conducting thorough and efficient reviews of COVID-19 response products. While COVID-19 remains a public health emergency, FDA will prioritize the review of COVID-19 therapeutics, including applications seeking tentative approval of generic products.&nbsp; FDA grants tentative approvals for products that meet the requirements for FDA approval but cannot be approved for exclusivity or patent reasons.&nbsp; <strong></strong></li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Test and Treat Strategy</strong>. The United States, alongside the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria (“Global Fund”), Unitaid, and other ACT-Accelerator partners, will promote “test-and-treat” strategies for the most vulnerable populations in low and middle-income countries to help prevent hospitalizations and deaths from COVID-19. The Global Fund will procure up to $80 million in COVID-19 rapid test kits and oral COVID-19 antiviral drugs, which would be linked to $20 million of American Rescue Plan Act funds that the U.S. Agency for International Development plans to use to quickly scale up test-and-treat implementation in up to eight countries globally in 2022, in coordination with other U.S. Government programs, including PEPFAR.&nbsp;It would build on an additional $22 million from Unitaid to produce over $120 million in investments to introduce test and treatment strategies in over 20 countries in 2022. This collaborative early investment would catalyze test-and-treat adoption and expansion in additional countries<strong>. This commitment is a down payment on U.S. leadership that can be fully realized if Congress acts to provide the President’s requested COVID-19 supplemental funding.</strong></li><li><strong>Additional vaccination support through Global VAX.</strong> Building on the more than $1.7 billion in funds committed to date, The United States, through the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), is providing an additional $15 million the U.S. Initiative for Global Vaccine Access (Global VAX), a whole-of-government effort to accelerate and expand vaccine readiness uptake in high-need countries, including 11 surge support countries. This funding will enable CDC to provide additional technical assistance and service delivery to countries for vaccination efforts, with a focus on high-risk populations. This will build upon $1.7 billion the United States is already providing through Global VAX.</li><li><strong>Expanded investments in&nbsp;bilateral global health security programs. &nbsp;</strong>To advance the Global Health Security Agenda and to accelerate the implementation of U.S. Global Health Security Strategy, the U.S. government will expand the number of global health security intensive support partner countries by eight this year, including to three new regions. This will improve countries’ capacities to prevent, detect, and respond to future COVID-19 variants and future health threats.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Expanding dose donation types to include boosters and pediatric doses to accelerate global vaccine coverage</strong>. The United States is <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2022/04/05/press-briefing-by-white-house-covid-19-response-team-and-hhs-public-health-officials-april-5-2022/">expanding Pfizer vaccine dose types</a> being donated globally to now include boosters and pediatric doses, as part of our 1 billion Pfizer dose donation commitment. This will help accelerate progress towards the 70% vaccination target and expand the availability of doses available for those at highest risk and for children globally.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Improving guidance for vaccine development to enhance protection. </strong>The United States, through the FDA, is committing to help align global health authorities and the WHO to provide advice to COVID-19 vaccine producers to inform which strains they use as the basis for vaccines, using predictions about the predominance of future strains and which strains will lead to vaccines that provide the broadest protection against unknown future variants.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Financing facility for COVID-19 vaccine and ancillary supply purchases and delivery through the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC). </strong> DFC has set up a vehicle to provide up to $1 billion to Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, to provide bridge financing guaranteeing commitments from other donors. This will allow COVAX to react immediately in a crisis to purchase and deliver ancillary supplies and vaccines on behalf of developing countries participating in the COVAX Advance Market Commitment.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Advancing COVID-19 vaccine research and development through the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI).&nbsp; </strong>At least $50 million of the U.S. Government’s <a href="https://www.usaid.gov/news-information/press-releases/mar-8-2022-usaid-announces-150-million-stimulate-and-accelerate-development">recent $150 million, 3-year pledge to CEPI</a> will support COVID-19 vaccine research in addition to the development of other vaccines and countermeasures for future emerging infectious diseases, with the goals of making vaccines more broadly protective and easier to administer in low-resource settings.</li></ul>



<p>Despite these commitments to combat COVID-19 and enhance future preparedness against health threats<strong>, there is more work to be done to ensure the United States can continue to lead, to make Americans and the world safer.</strong>&nbsp; President Biden continues to urge Congress to act promptly to provide supplemental resources. Without additional emergency funding, the United States will be unable to purchase additional life-saving treatments for the American people.&nbsp; The United States will be less able to stop the spread of possible new variants from around the world.&nbsp; The United States will be unable to keep vaccinating the world against COVID-19 and getting shots into arms, to save lives here at home and abroad.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>The United States of America and the European Union are implementing the <strong>U.S.-EU Agenda for Beating the Global Pandemic, Vaccinating the World, Saving Lives Now and Building Back Better Health Security </strong>of <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/09/22/a-u-s-eu-agenda-for-beating-the-global-pandemic-vaccinating-the-world-saving-lives-now-and-building-back-better-health-security/">September 22, 2021</a>. Today, Presidents Biden and von der Leyen reaffirmed milestones in their strong cooperation towards the five headline goals of the Agenda, and they previewed further joint action below:</p>



<p><strong><em>Vaccine equity and ‘shots-in-arms’. </em></strong>Having shared a combined total of more than one billion COVID-19 vaccine doses, and in line with a commitment to share a total of 1.9 billion doses around the world, the EU and U.S. seek to ensure ongoing <strong>deliveries are based on country demand, informed by best practices and reach ‘tarmac to arms’</strong>, with focus on sub-Saharan Africa. Through support from Team Europe and U.S. Global VAX programs, both sides recognise that vaccine equity starts with best practice donation principles including adequate and transparent planning in <strong>cooperation with governments, in-country partners, COVAX (as part of ACT-A), Africa Vaccine Acquisition Task Team (AVATT), World Health Organization (WHO), the COVID- 19 Vaccine Delivery Partnership (CoVDP), </strong>and others. Given that dose supply is currently not constrained, the partnership should pay particular attention to enhancing vaccine readiness, strengthening logistics, combating hesitancy, and building longer-term capacity by means of health systems strengthening, and immediate capability for vaccine uptake as part of the global COVID-19 Vaccine Delivery Partnership. To strengthen our partnership, the U.S. and EU will actively consult with partners including AVATT, CoVDP, and COVAX on strategies to accelerate vaccine absorption. The U.S. and EU will strengthen dialogues with multilateral development banks and global partners aiming towards better uptake of and sustainable financing for in-country vaccination operations.<br><br></p>



<p><strong><em>Strengthening global supply chains and manufacturing. </em></strong>The need to ensure vaccine and therapeutic dose supply and administration in the face of supply chain constraints led to the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/STATEMENT_21_4847">launch</a> of the joint <strong>EU-U.S. COVID-19 manufacturing and supply chain task force </strong>in September 2021. The leaders expect that the task force will extend its activities to provide <strong>early warning of supply chain bottlenecks </strong>that could hamper global availability of vaccines and treatments, and to coordinate efforts to sustain vaccine and therapeutics production capabilities for variants and future pandemics, including in Africa.<br><br></p>



<p><strong><em>Enhanced EU-US coordination to improve global health security architecture. </em></strong>Enhancing pandemic prevention, preparedness and response (PPR) capacities requires strong international cooperation, and the U.S. and the EU are committed to cooperate to this end, including under the lines of effort of the COVID-19 Prioritized Global Action Plan for Enhanced Engagement (GAP). Enhanced PPR requires a strengthening of the global health architecture, including of the WHO at the center, and sustainable financing. Presidents Biden and von der Leyen welcomed the support of the G20 under Indonesia’s leadership, and committed to cooperate on the establishment of a new <strong>Financial Intermediary Fund (FIF) for pandemic preparedness and global health security </strong>at the World Bank, including its <strong>sustainable capitalization</strong>, governance and structure. The U.S. and EU committed to support the early design and implementation of the FIF. The leaders will also cooperate towards the conclusion of a convention, agreement or other international instrument on pandemic prevention, preparedness and response at the WHO, and targeted amendments to the International Health Regulations, in order to <strong>strengthen the global rulebook for pandemic PPR</strong>. The EU and the U.S. are working together with <strong>expert dialogue </strong>to forge consensus on targeted IHR amendments and the content of a pandemic instrument. They also recognise the importance of engagement with other partners to take forward both sustainable financing for PPR and a strengthened WHO.<br><br></p>



<p><strong><em>Preparing for the future, pathogen detection and monitoring, joint threat assessment and response. </em></strong>The EU and U.S. will collaborate to improve pathogen monitoring and threat assessment, leveraging existing and novel approaches, providing integrated surveillance, real-time monitoring, early warning systems, forecasting and analytics, intelligence exchange, supporting rapid response networks, and an ‘always-ready’ health emergency workforce to prevent or mitigate cross-border outbreaks, all within a One Health approach.</p>



<p><strong><em>Research and development for new vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics. </em></strong>Acknowledging the importance of swiftly reacting to pandemics, the U.S. and EU support science to shorten the cycle for the development of safe and effective vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics from 300 to 100 days following the identification of such threats and work to make them widely available. In the near term, the EU and U.S. committed to deepen <strong>cooperation to identify and evaluate variant adapted, more broadly protective, and next generation vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics, while ensuring their safety and efficacy</strong>. The U.S. and the EU will work towards aligning R&amp;D investments with manufacturing and manufacturing capabilities development, and will conclude a formal administrative arrangement on preparedness and response for public health threats to be signed this month between the European Commission Health Emergency and Preparedness Response Authority (HERA) and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.</p>

<p>Today, we mark a tragic milestone: one million American lives lost to COVID-19. One million empty chairs around the dinner table. Each an irreplaceable loss. Each leaving behind a family, a community, and a nation forever changed because of this pandemic. Jill and I pray for each of them.</p>



<p>To those who are grieving, and asking yourself how will you go on without him or what will you do without her, I understand. I know the pain of that black hole in your heart. It is unrelenting. But I also know the ones you love are never truly gone. They will always be with you.</p>



<p>As a nation, we must not grow numb to such sorrow. To heal, we must remember. We must remain vigilant against this pandemic and do everything we can to save as many lives as possible, as we have with more testing, vaccines, and treatments than ever before. It’s critical that Congress sustain these resources in the coming months. &nbsp;</p>



<p>In remembrance, let us draw strength from each other as fellow Americans. For while we have been humbled, we never give up.&nbsp;We can and will do this together as the United States of America.</p>



<p>May God bless the one million American lives lost and their loved ones left behind.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Marriott Marquis Chicago<br>Chicago, Illinois</p>



<p>5:39 P.M. CDT<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Thank you, thank you, thank you, Gov.&nbsp; Gov, you’ve been a great friend and a great partner on COVID, the economy, and so much more.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>And like most everybody in this room who is involved in public life, I remember them that was there first.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Thank you, thank you, thank you.&nbsp; You made a big difference in my being able to stand here as President of the United States.&nbsp; Many of you in this audience did as well.&nbsp;<br><br>I know you&#8217;ve been here a long time, so I&#8217;m not going to make a long, formal speech to you.&nbsp;<br><br>But look, you know, I want to thank Jaime Harrison for his leadership.&nbsp; And, you know, if things were working okay until we got to South Carolina in the primary, then we won every single county.&nbsp; So thank you, Jaime.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br><br>I want to thank all of you for the support and generosity.&nbsp; I can go around the room and at least 15 of you were deeply involved with my campaign &#8212; and even before the campaign, in my career.&nbsp; So thank you for all you&#8217;ve done.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Look, you know, I&#8217;m proud of the progress we&#8217;ve made.&nbsp; There&#8217;s a lot more to do, but I&#8217;m proud of the progress we&#8217;ve made.&nbsp;<br><br>We&#8217;ve talked about how &#8212; you know, people say, “Well, you know, Biden won.”&nbsp; Well, it was a fairly low bar to get over because of the nature of how much the last guy changed American politics.&nbsp; He changed it in a way that made it more petty.&nbsp;<br><br>When I ran &#8212; you may remember &#8212; no reason why you should, but I remember I said, “I&#8217;m running to restore the soul of America; to rebuild the backbone of the country, the middle class of America; and to try to unite the country because democracies can&#8217;t function very well unless we can arrive at consensus.”&nbsp;<br><br>I also said at the time, and I&#8217;ve been saying since then, that we&#8217;re really in a battle worldwide between democracies and oligarchies.&nbsp; The fact of the matter is, I&#8217;ve spent a lot of time with Xi Jinping &#8212; they tell me more than any other world leader has.&nbsp; When he was vice president and I was vice president, I traveled 17,000 miles with him.&nbsp; Spent a lot of time since he&#8217;s been &#8212; since I got elected President talking to him.&nbsp; And he&#8217;s a very bright guy, but very &#8212; he doesn’t have a democratic &#8212; with a small “d” &#8212; bone in his body.&nbsp;<br><br>But he knows exactly what he wants.&nbsp; He knows exactly what he&#8217;s trying to do.&nbsp; And he&#8217;s very straightforward.&nbsp; He makes the point that, at this inflection point in history, world history &#8212; and it comes about every four or five generations &#8212; this fundamental change that takes place not because of any one particular leader, but because the nature of the change occurring in the world, whether it&#8217;s technology or anything else.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>And he thinks that democracies require consensus, they can&#8217;t operate quickly enough in this changing world.<br><br>Your children are going to see more change in the next 10 years than we&#8217;ve seen in the last 50 years &#8212; the last 100 years, possibly &#8212; in the world and in the United States.&nbsp; And so, there&#8217;s a lot at stake &#8212; a whole lot at stake.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>And I believe &#8212; and I come at this with an enormous sense of optimism.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s any nation in the world that’s better prepared to deal with the changing world than the United States of America.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>We&#8217;re the only nation in the world that has come out of every crisis stronger than we went into it.&nbsp; Not a joke.&nbsp; Think about it.&nbsp; Every crisis we&#8217;ve ever encountered &#8212; war, famine, whatever it was &#8212; we&#8217;ve come out stronger than when we went in.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s been my objective, because I believe the American public and the world is ready.&nbsp;<br><br>When I was first elected, I attended my first meeting of the G7 &#8212; the democracies in Europe and a few in Asia &#8212; in England.&nbsp; And I sat down and I said, “America is back.”&nbsp; And they looked at me &#8212; two of them, I will not, because it was &#8212; they were private meetings &#8212; not say who said it &#8212; but two of the world leaders looked at me and said, “But for how long?”&nbsp; “But for how long?”&nbsp;<br><br>One of the things I think we &#8212; we sort of underestimate is that imagine what we&#8217;d be thinking if tomorrow we went back and the news on television showed a group of hundreds of people &#8212; not at war &#8212; breaking down the doors of the British Parliament, killing two or three of the people who work there &#8212; guards there &#8212; and doing what was done on the 6th of &#8212; the 6th of January.&nbsp; Imagine what we’d think.&nbsp;<br><br>We are the democracy of the world.&nbsp; And it really is true.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not &#8212; that it&#8217;s not chauvinism about America.&nbsp; It&#8217;s just a fact.&nbsp;<br><br>One of the things I realized that &#8212; Senator Braun and I worked a long time together.&nbsp; One of the things I realized, Carol, was that I knew that we were the essential nation as &#8212; as the former Secretary of State, who we just buried, would say &#8212; but I didn&#8217;t fully appreciate it until I became President.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not about Joe Biden; it’s about the office of the presidency.&nbsp;<br><br>The rest of the world looks to us.&nbsp; They expect us to lead.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not joking.&nbsp; We are the essential nation.&nbsp; We are the essential nation.&nbsp;<br><br>And that gives us so many incredible opportunities if we&#8217;re not afraid to take them and move them, and take on this new sort of petty, mean-spirited notion that has guided the other team.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>There&#8217;s still a lot of good Republicans in the Senate.&nbsp; But it&#8217;s amazing to me how they&#8217;re cowered by Trump and how he has such concern.<br><br>I&#8217;ve had &#8212; I, obviously, will never name them, but I have &#8212; six of them have told me &#8212; senators I used to serve with; we served with; some of them you served with, Carol &#8212; said that, “You know, I agree with you on such and such a thing.&nbsp; But if I vote for it, they&#8217;ll primary and I&#8217;ll lose my seat.”&nbsp; Doesn&#8217;t go to political courage, but it goes to the recognition that there still are a lot of Republicans who want to get things done.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>But we have to take on the &#8212; MAGA Republicans &#8212; “Make America Great Again” Republicans.&nbsp; I think they&#8217;re the most extreme party.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s what the Republican Party is now.&nbsp; Not everybody Republican believes that.&nbsp; But the fact of the matter is, they run the show &#8212; the MAGA Republicans,<br><br>The idea that they do the things that they’re doing now, and the things that they’re saying &#8212; I think if we had sat down here five years ago, seven years ago, eight years ago, and said this was going to happen, you’d all look at me &#8212; and I would have thought myself &#8212; nuts saying some of the things that they’re saying.&nbsp; But it really is beyond the pale.&nbsp;<br><br>You know, one of the things that I think we have to do is not just talk about what we&#8217;ve done &#8212; and we don&#8217;t do that enough, and that&#8217;s my fault.&nbsp;<br><br>You know, I remember, with Barack, when we passed the Affordable Care Act.&nbsp; I said, “Barack, you ought to take a victory lap.”&nbsp; And I remember what he said to me.&nbsp; He said, “We don&#8217;t have time, Joe.&nbsp; There&#8217;s too much to do.”&nbsp; Everything but locusts has landed on his desk.&nbsp; Locusts landed on my desk.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;<br><br>But really, think about what we&#8217;ve done so far.&nbsp; You know, if you just do it in terms of just practical &#8212; practical application of what has usually been the mid- &#8212; the measures by which people measure whether or not an administration is functioning, we&#8217;re in a situation where we&#8217;ve gone from 2 million people with vaccinations when we took over office to 220 million fully vaccinated.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve gone from jobs &#8212; a jobs report to 428,000 jobs last month, 8.3 million jobs my first 15 months in office &#8212; more than any President has in American history.&nbsp; Well, it’s not about me.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br><br>Thank you, but it really isn’t about me.&nbsp; What it&#8217;s about is that &#8212; you know, the Republicans say that, well, the things we did with the Recov- &#8212; with the legislation we passed is causing inflation.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Well guess what?&nbsp; The first year in office, we&#8217;ve reduced the deficit by $350 billion.&nbsp; In fact &#8212; $350 billion &#8212; reduced the deficit.&nbsp; And this year, we&#8217;re on track, in the next two months, to reduce the deficit by 1 trillion 500 billion dollars.&nbsp; Never happened before in American history.&nbsp;<br><br>But look, the biggest investments that have ever been made &#8212; and the governor talks about it and does it really well on what he’s &#8212; and how he uses the funding &#8212; is in infrastructure.&nbsp; One&nbsp;<s>billion</s>&nbsp;[trillion] two hundred&nbsp;<s>million</s>[billion] dollars in infrastructure.<br><br>We used to have the number-one infrastructure in the world &#8212; the world.&nbsp; That&#8217;s what drove our growth.&nbsp; That&#8217;s what drove our prosperity.&nbsp; That&#8217;s what moved us.&nbsp; We&#8217;re now number 14 in the world &#8212; the United States of America.&nbsp; China is now number two.<br><br>And look, the idea that we&#8217;ve sat around and haven’t moved until now &#8212; but now, we &#8212; there’s, you know, 6,000 &#8212; 60,000 miles of road in your state that we&#8217;re going to be able to take care of.&nbsp; No, I mean it.&nbsp; I know you know it.&nbsp; You know it better than anybody.&nbsp; But there&#8217;s a whole range of &#8212;<br><br>(Cellphone rings.)<br><br>I know that’s Trump calling.&nbsp; He always does this when I talk.&nbsp; (Laughter.)<br><br>But &#8212; but all kidding aside, what we&#8217;re doing here is that we’ve made the biggest investments in infrastructure; historic investments in solar, wind, and battery technology &#8212; notwithstanding the fact that we still need one vote to get the $508 billion that is still left in my legislation that we thought we were going to get passed.&nbsp; We were one vote short, but we&#8217;re going to get it done.&nbsp; We&#8217;re going to get it done.&nbsp;<br><br>But here&#8217;s the deal: The historic investments are one thing, but, you know, one of the things I&#8217;ve tried to do when I got elected &#8212; and because I talked with many of you about this in detail beforehand &#8212; I said I&#8217;d have administration that looked like America &#8212; an administration that looked like America.&nbsp;<br><br>We have the most diverse administration in American history by a longshot &#8212; by a longshot.&nbsp; Over half our major appointees &#8212; both Senate confirmed as well as appointed &#8212; are women.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>We&#8217;re in a situation where we have a significant number of all minorities that are &#8212; look, I mean, we&#8217;ve appointed more &#8212; more circuit court of appeals judges who are Black women than every other President in American history.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>And we have a &#8212; we have an associate justice about to go on the Court, God willing, who is brilliant.&nbsp; But I tell you, she&#8217;s going to be the first &#8212; I made a commitment there’d be the first Black woman on the Supreme Court.&nbsp; And it matters.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>And I think because &#8212; because of how outrageous some of the things that former President Trump has done and said, I think we found ourselves at a position where it was almost like, “How could that happen?&nbsp; How can that be?”&nbsp; And I think, in a sense &#8212; until we got elected and we changed presidents, I think people started to lose faith in the capacity of the American government to deliver &#8212; to deliver, to make life better for people.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>We have so many opportunities available to us.&nbsp; So many opportunities.&nbsp;<br><br>We have to remember that we&#8217;re talking about a relatively small number of people who are the MAGA Republicans.&nbsp; We may be talking about as much as one third of the electorate.&nbsp; That&#8217;s more than I&#8217;d ever thought would occur.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>But we got to take the fight to them.&nbsp; We got to make our case and make it very strongly, in my opinion.&nbsp;<br><br>And, you know, we have a strong record to run on.&nbsp; The economy is &#8212; our economy is one of those that we believe is from the bottom up and the middle out.&nbsp; Because when the middle class does well, everybody does just fine.&nbsp; The wealthy do very well.&nbsp; The poor have a road up.&nbsp; And the middle class has built the country.&nbsp; That&#8217;s who&#8217;s built the country.&nbsp;<br><br>We find ourselves protecting and expanding civil rights.&nbsp; Well, we got to speak out more.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve got to make sure that we make our case and keep repeatedly making our case.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>And we have to have &#8212; you know, reasserting America&#8217;s leadership in the world, because we are.&nbsp;<br><br>Look at &#8212; I’ll bet you &#8212; I can tell you that there are &#8212; a vast majority of the foreign policy establishment and military establishment are surprised at how incompetent the Russians have been so far &#8212; looking at how they’ve conducted themselves.&nbsp; And yet, we &#8212; we tended to think they were 10 feet tall &#8212; many folks.&nbsp;<br><br>It doesn&#8217;t mean we won’t &#8212; I&#8217;m not going to put a single American troop in Ukraine.&nbsp; But we&#8217;re going to make sure Ukraine has what they need to be able to defend themselves.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>But here&#8217;s the deal: The point is that I think we have to start looking at the world as it really is.&nbsp; You&#8217;ve heard me say before, I think we&#8217;re &#8212; you know, about every &#8212; anywhere from three to five generations, we reach an inflection point of world history where things began to change, whether it&#8217;s because of technology, the environment, or changes in the relationship amongst nations.&nbsp; They change in a big way.&nbsp; And we have to be in a position to understand that we have the capacity to try to make sure that in this inflection point, we know what we&#8217;re doing.&nbsp;<br><br>And we have an opportunity to increase &#8212; increase not to decrease &#8212; the whole notion of equity in the world, the whole notion of how we look at one another, the whole notion of &#8212;&nbsp;<br><br>For example, you know, Putin is in a situation &#8212; and my last discussion with him was a while ago &#8212; was, you know, his &#8212; the tundra in the Arctic in Russia is burning, burning, burning.&nbsp; No, I mean, literally burning&nbsp; &#8212; leaking methane, which is so much more dangerous than any other thing that can affect the environment.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s not going to &#8212; it&#8217;s not&#8211; it&#8217;s not going to freeze again.&nbsp;<br><br>So, there&#8217;s so many things that have to be dealt with, but they present enormous opportunities if we are &#8212; and gather ourselves together and figure out who &#8212; remind ourselves of who we are and what we want to do.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>And look, the other thing I&#8217;d say is that, you know, the whole idea &#8212; if this draft opinion in the Supreme Court turns out to be the opinion of the Supreme Court, it is everything that some of us talked about before.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>You may remember I led the fight to defeat Robert Bork’s nomination as Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, because I was convinced &#8212;<br><br>When we started off that nominating hearing, I said &#8212; because I&#8217;d read everything he had ever written and every decision he’d ever written &#8212; and he was a bright &#8212; he was a brilliant guy.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>And I said to him &#8212; I said, “Judge…” &#8212; he had been a judge.&nbsp; And I said, “Judge, let me describe to you what I think your constitutional philosophy is and mine, and you tell me whether we &#8212; whether we differ, whether I accurately am portraying it.”&nbsp;<br><br>And I said, “Judge, you believe that the Constitution &#8212; the Ninth Amendment is an inkblot in the Constitution and, secondly, that there is no such thing as a right to privacy in the Constitution.&nbsp; And you believe the rights you possess are because the government gave them to you.&nbsp; They gave them to you.&nbsp; I believe the rights I possess are because I&#8217;m a child of God, because I just exist.&nbsp; And I, by implication, gave up some of those rights to the government for purposes of making society function.”&nbsp; And I went on from there.&nbsp; And he said, “I agree, it&#8217;s exactly the difference.”&nbsp;<br><br>Well, look, what we&#8217;re talking about here.&nbsp; It’s not only the brutality of taking away a woman&#8217;s right to control her own body and all the damage that does physically, psychologically, practically.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>But it also, if you read the opinion &#8212; if it turns out to be the same opinion &#8212; basically says there is no such thing as a right to privacy.&nbsp; Mark my words: If that decision holds, it&#8217;s not only we&#8217;re going to be fighting for a woman&#8217;s right to control her own body and the brutality that goes along with having to give birth in a circumstance that is something beyond what &#8212; that can be tolerated, but what else is going to happen?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Mark my words: They&#8217;re going to go after the right of the &#8212; Supreme Court decision on the right of same-sex marriage.&nbsp; They&#8217;re going to go after &#8212; they&#8217;re going to &#8212; we&#8217;re going to be back to Griswold vs. Connecticut, where there was a time in Connecticut law where it said a married couple, in the privacy of their own bedroom, cannot use contraception; it was a decision &#8212; the government can make the decision you can&#8217;t do that.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>You&#8217;re going to see these decisions up for grabs and further split the United States.&nbsp; We&#8217;re going to be arguing about things we shouldn&#8217;t have to argue about.&nbsp;<br><br>So I think it&#8217;s important that as we go forward &#8212; and you&#8217;re going to hear me talking more about not only what we&#8217;ve done, but what they&#8217;re trying to do.&nbsp;<br><br>For example, if you take a look at what the leader &#8212; their &#8212; the head of their campaign committee, the distinguished senator from &#8212; Republican senator from Florida &#8212; he talks about that what he has in mind is that they&#8217;re going to &#8212; he&#8217;s laid out the only plan put forward in the last years, what the Republican Party stands for, what they&#8217;re going to run on.&nbsp;<br><br>And what they say is &#8212; it&#8217;s really quite basic.&nbsp; They&#8217;re making the point that what happens is that what they&#8217;re going to be &#8212; we&#8217;re going to increase taxes on 90 percent of the American public, people making a &#8212; excuse me, 70 percent of the American public &#8212; people making under $100,000 a year are going to have tax, because the notion is everybody should pay something.&nbsp; Even a family that&#8217;s raising three kids, in fact is making 25-, 30,000 bucks a year, they should be paying federal taxes.&nbsp; Nothing for people who can afford to pay more.&nbsp;<br><br>Secondly, there is a provision in the bill they put forward &#8212; the law they&#8217;re proposing &#8212; that every five years, Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid will be on the chopping block, that Congress will have to affirmatively again vote to put them into the law.&nbsp; Otherwise, they will &#8212; it goes out of the law.&nbsp;<br><br>And you know what they&#8217;re going to do, those of you hold public office.&nbsp; If that were ever to pass and they were to take control, what they&#8217;re going to do is they&#8217;ll use that as a bargaining chip.&nbsp; They&#8217;ll say, “Unless you vote for such and such, unless you end your attempt to try to force environmental regulations in place, we&#8217;re going to cut the following elements of one of those programs.”&nbsp;<br><br>The idea that &#8212; and it&#8217;s in writing &#8212; that every five years you&#8217;d have to reauthorize Social Security, which you&#8217;ve paid into your whole life &#8212; have to reauthorize that?&nbsp; I won&#8217;t go through it all, and I&#8217;m going &#8212; taking too much of your time.&nbsp; But is really a genuinely radical agenda.&nbsp;<br><br>And I think we have to point out how radical it is &#8212; how radical it is &#8212; so people are reminded what&#8217;s at stake here, not only internationally, but domestically, in terms of people&#8217;s basic fundamental rights, in terms of education.<br><br>Did you ever think we&#8217;d be in a position in the year 2022 &#8212; we&#8217;d be talking about banning books in schools?&nbsp; I mean, you know, the idea that you cannot mention &#8212; you cannot mention to the school.&nbsp; What&#8217;s going to happen to a gay child, an L[G]BTQ child in school?&nbsp; I mean, this thing &#8212; it’s one thing to take on Disney World.&nbsp; They&#8217;re going to storm Cinderella&#8217;s castle before this is over.&nbsp;<br><br>But I mean it.&nbsp; Think about it.&nbsp; If I told you these things, I think you&#8217;d think I was crazy.&nbsp; You may think I&#8217;m crazy anyway, but &#8212; (laughter) &#8212; but &#8212;<br><br>So, folks, we got a lot of work to do.&nbsp; We got a lot of work.&nbsp; I think we can pick up three Senate seats.&nbsp; And I think we can increase our majority in the House, but we have to do it by more than just a couple of votes.&nbsp; We have to do it by more than a couple of votes, because it&#8217;s getting much too close.&nbsp;<br><br>If, in fact, they were to win back the House and/or the Senate, we got a different world we&#8217;re in.&nbsp; We got a different world we&#8217;re in.&nbsp;<br><br>And so, again, I&#8217;m taking too much of your time.&nbsp; But that&#8217;s why what you&#8217;re doing is so damn important.&nbsp; It really makes a difference.&nbsp; It makes a gigantic difference.&nbsp;<br><br>And so, we&#8217;re going to be hopefully having the DNC spend a lot more time and, quite frankly, money making the larger generic case.&nbsp; And we can do it honestly, without having to exaggerate or make up things that are not on the docket.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>And so, I want to thank you all so very, very much for the time and the effort.&nbsp; And I realize your time is even more valuable than your contribution because you all are people of consequence who are &#8212; have a lot you have to do.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>But, look, the &#8212; we have to make sure we keep this clear contrast on either side.&nbsp; This is &#8212; as I said, this is not your father&#8217;s Republican Party.&nbsp; This is a different breed of cat.&nbsp; I mean, all kidding aside, it really is.&nbsp; It really is.<br><br>There&#8217;s some really decent Republicans in the House and the Senate, but they&#8217;re so overwhelmed and intimidated.&nbsp; And some of them are just leaving.&nbsp; They’re giving up their seats and just moving &#8212; moving out of public life.<br><br>And, you know, if the Court follows this leaked opinion, it has the potential to generate significant enthusiasm to get out and vote, but it also has an enormous potential if &#8212; if we fail, what that will mean &#8212; what that will mean.&nbsp;<br><br>And so, folks, we &#8212; these guys are doing everything &#8212; I got involved in politics &#8212; I’ll end with this &#8212; because of civil rights.&nbsp; I come from a state that has the eighth-largest Black population in America as a percent of population: Delaware.&nbsp; We have &#8212; we&#8217;re the eighth-largest population.&nbsp;<br><br>As a matter of fact, we were one of those border states in the Civil War.&nbsp; We were a slave state, to our shame, like Maryland and &#8212; anyway.<br><br>And &#8212; and so it is &#8212; that&#8217;s what got me involved.&nbsp; I used to &#8212; we moved from Wilmington &#8212; from, excuse me, Scranton, Pennsylvania, where there were very few African Americans, down to Wilmington, to a place called Claymont, Delaware, which was a &#8212; it sits on the border of the Pennsylvania state line, where there are more oil companies and refineries than in Houston, Texas.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>And I went to a little Catholic school called Holy Rosary, which is &#8212; I was in third grade.&nbsp; And it was up what they call a Philadelphia pike, a four-lane access road.&nbsp; It was &#8212; where it went through the little town of Claymont.&nbsp; It was &#8212; I-95 is.&nbsp; It replaced it, in effect.&nbsp;<br><br>And I remember asking my mother &#8212; it was too dangerous to walk up because of the streets you had to cross.&nbsp; So my mother would drive me from this apartment complex we moved into.<br><br>And I remember, dropped off in the parking lot, I’d always see this bus go by.&nbsp; And they&#8217;re all Black kids in the bus.&nbsp; At the time, they weren&#8217;t called “Black kids”; there were “negroes” on the bus.&nbsp;<br><br>And I asked why.&nbsp; She told me they weren&#8217;t allowed to go to school &#8212; and this was before Brown vs. the Board in Delaware, which &#8212; and we were one of the cases &#8212; Delaware was &#8212; in Brown vs. the Board.&nbsp; And I thought to myself, “What&#8217;s going on?”<br><br>But the point is that &#8212; think about it.&nbsp; Think about it: where we are today, what we&#8217;re fighting over.&nbsp; There are more restrictive efforts to restrict the right to vote today than there’d been in my whole political career.&nbsp; I thought we were well by that.&nbsp;<br><br>I was chairman of the Judiciary Committee of the United States Senate, and I was able to extend the Voting Rights Act for 25 years.&nbsp; I got Strom Thurmond to vote to extend it.&nbsp; Not a joke.&nbsp;<br><br>And I thought, “Well, my God, we can do it.&nbsp; We can defeat hate.”&nbsp; But I made a big mistake, a lesson I learned: Hate never goes away; it just hides.&nbsp; It hides under the rocks.&nbsp; And when somebody breathes oxygen under those rocks, it comes out in ways that we never thought it would &#8212; I never thought I&#8217;d see again.&nbsp;<br><br>And look where we are now.&nbsp; Look at all the states that have changed the means by which people can vote, letting the states decide whether or not the vote counts, count the vote.&nbsp; I mean, come on.&nbsp; What in God&#8217;s name is going on?<br><br>So, there&#8217;s so much at stake.&nbsp; I&#8217;m convinced we will succeed if we make our case.&nbsp; I&#8217;m convinced that we will be able to do this.&nbsp; But we also have to understand that if we miss, what&#8217;s at stake?<br><br>A distinguished senator from your neighboring state of Wisconsin, Ron Johnson &#8212; he&#8217;s made it very clear.&nbsp; He&#8217;s going after &#8212; repeal the Affordable Care Act again.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve expanded it so people are saving 2,400 bucks a year on their &#8212; on their healthcare costs.&nbsp;<br><br>And, you know, we&#8217;re going to need to control the House and the Senate.&nbsp; And we need your support to reach out to those registered voters and convince them that it&#8217;s worth their effort, that it matters.&nbsp; It matters to us a great deal.&nbsp; It matters to them.&nbsp;<br><br>And I think that &#8212; it sounds a little melodramatic, but I can say this to a sophisticated audience involved in politics, as you all are.&nbsp; I really do think we&#8217;re still in the battle for the soul of America.&nbsp; Not a joke.&nbsp;<br><br>I wasn&#8217;t going to run again, as Billy Brodsky knows.&nbsp; We went to school together.&nbsp; I really wasn&#8217;t.&nbsp; I was a professor at the University of Pennsylvania.&nbsp; I was enjoying it.&nbsp;<br><br>But when those folks came marching out of the fields in Charlottesville, Virginia, carrying torches &#8212; torches, chanting the same anti-Semitic bile &#8212; the same anti-Semitic bile chanted in the streets of everywhere from Nuremberg to Berlin in the early ‘30s &#8212; exact language, by the way.&nbsp; Go check it out.&nbsp; Carrying swastikas, accompanied by the Ku Klux Klan.&nbsp; And a young woman was killed in the process.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>And the then-President of the United States was asked &#8212; was asked the question, “What do you think?”&nbsp; He said there are very good people on both sides.<br><br>We can&#8217;t let this happen, guys.&nbsp; So, we have to &#8212; we have to &#8212; and it&#8217;s going to be hard.&nbsp; It&#8217;s going to be hard, because inflation is going to scare the living hell out of everybody.&nbsp;<br><br>I was raised in a family where when gas prices went up significantly and food went up, it was &#8212; it mattered to my family.&nbsp; It mattered.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>We&#8217;re making progress, but there’s going to be a way to go.&nbsp; Our inflation rate is lower than almost any other nation &#8212; industrial nation in the world.&nbsp; We&#8217;re in a situation where we find ourselves with supply chain problems and Putin&#8217;s gas tax in the extreme.&nbsp;<br><br>But we have a problem we have to deal with.&nbsp; In the meantime, we can&#8217;t take our eye off all that could happen if we do not prevail.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>And so, I&#8217;m counting on you all.&nbsp; I really mean it. &nbsp;And the DNC is going to have to play an increasingly important role in how we get this done.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>I apologize for going on so long, but thank you very much for listening.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br><br>6:09 P.M. CDT<br><br></p>
