<p>President Biden met today with President Yoon Suk Yeol of the Republic of Korea and Prime Minister Fumio Kishida of Japan on the sidelines of the NATO Summit. This was a historic trilateral meeting in which the three Leaders discussed enhancing trilateral cooperation throughout the Indo-Pacific, particularly in regard to addressing the evolving threat posed by the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea’s unlawful weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs. They also followed up on their detailed and productive conversations in Seoul and Tokyo last month. President Biden underscored the United States’ unshakable commitment to the defense of both Japan and the Republic of Korea.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Institución Ferial de Madrid<br>Madrid, Spain</p>



<p>10:17 A.M. CEST</p>



<p>PRESIDENT BIDEN: Well, Jens, thank you very much for having me this morning. And, you know, we &#8212; we got a big agenda. And it’s great to be here with you to kick off the &#8212; I think is a history-making summit. And we talked about this for a year, and now we’re here.</p>



<p>Our meetings today &#8212; we’re going to approve a new NATO Strategic Concept and reaffirm the unity and determination of our Alliance to defend every inch of NATO territory. And Article 5 is sacrosanct, and we mean it when we say, “An attack against one is an attack against all &#8212; every inch.”</p>



<p>And so, at this summit, the full Alliance is going to welcome Finland and Sweden &#8212; their historic application for membership &#8212; and their decision to move away from neutrality and the tradition of neutrality to join NATO Alliance is going to make us stronger and more secure, and NATO stronger.</p>



<p>We’re sending an unmistakable message, in my view &#8212; and I think yours as well &#8212; that NATO is strong, united, and the steps we’re taking during this summit are going to further augment our collective strength.</p>



<p>To that end, today I’m announcing the United States will enhance our force posture in Europe and respond to the changed security environment, as well as strengthening our collective security.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, we surged 20,000 additional U.S. forces to Europe to bolster our Alliance in response to Russia’s aggressive move, bringing our force total in Europe to 100,000.</p>



<p>We’re going to continue to adjust our posture based on the threat, in close consultation with our Allies.</p>



<p>Here in Spain, we’re going to work with our Ally to increase U.S. Navy destroyers stationed in Spain’s Rota Naval Base from three to &#8212; from four to six &#8212; four to six destroyers.</p>



<p>In Poland, we’re going to establish a permanent headquarters for the U.S. Army Fifth Corps and &#8212; strengthening our U.S.-NATO interoperability across the entire eastern flank.</p>



<p>We’re going to maintain additional rotational Brigade &#8212; which is 3,000 fighters and another 2,000 personnel &#8212; Combat Team here in Europe, headquartered in Romania.</p>



<p>And we’re going to enhance our rotational deployments in &#8212; deployments in the Baltic states.</p>



<p>And we’re going to send two additional F-35 squadrons to the UK, and station additional air defense and other capabilities in Germany and in Italy.</p>



<p>And together, our Allies &#8212; we’re going to make sure that NATO is ready to meet threats from all directions, across every domain: land, air, and the sea.</p>



<p>In a moment when Putin has shattered peace in Europe and attacked the very, very tenets of the rules-based order, the United States and our Allies &#8212; we’re going to step up. We’re stepping up.</p>



<p>We’re proving that NATO is more needed now than it ever has been and it’s as important as it has ever been.</p>



<p>So I want to thank you, Jens, for leading the Alliance through this crisis and for your work to strengthen NATO for all the challenges that lie ahead. And I &#8212; I genuinely look forward to our discussion today.</p>



<p>And, again, thank you for your leadership. It’s important.</p>



<p>SECRETARY GENERAL STOLTENBERG: Thank you so much, President Biden, dear Joe. It&#8217;s really good to see you here in Madrid so soon after we met in the White House in Washington. And thank you for your personal leadership and the U.S. commitment to NATO, to European security demonstrated by the announcement &#8212; the announcements you just made to further increase U.S. presence in Europe.</p>



<p>And this really demonstrates your decisive leadership in strengthening the transatlantic bond, and also see that in the unwavering support from you and from the United States to Ukraine. That will be a main issue at the summit today.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ll meet with President Zelenskyy. He will address the summit. And as you said, this will be an historic summit. It will be a transformative summit where we will make decisions that will actually change this Alliance for many years to come.</p>



<p>We will agree a new Strategic Concept, the blueprint for NATO into the future &#8212; a more dangerous world, a more competitive world. We will agree the biggest overhaul of our collective defense deterrence since the end of the Cold War &#8212; and the U.S. is, of course, very much part of that.</p>



<p>And then we will invite Finland and Sweden to join NATO. And that demonstrates that NATO&#8217;s door is open. It demonstrates that President Putin has not succeeded in closing NATO’s door.</p>



<p>He is getting the opposite of what he wants. He wants less NATO; President Putin is getting more NATO by Finland and Sweden joining our Alliance.</p>



<p>We will agree a comprehensive assistance package for Ukraine. And then I also welcome the fact that we are able now to state that actually &#8212; that European Allies and Canada are stepping up with more troops, higher readiness, and also increased defense spending.</p>



<p>New figures shows that they have added 350 billion extra U.S. dollars for defense since we made the pledge back in 2014.</p>



<p>So, all in all, this demonstrates unity and the strength of our Alliance. So, thank you, Joe.</p>



<p>PRESIDENT BIDEN: Well, you know, I was asked about this one &#8212; about Finland and &#8212; and Sweden &#8212; when each of their leaders came to the White House. And I said Putin was looking for the “Finlandization” of Europe. He’s going to get the “NATO-ization” of Europe. And that&#8217;s exactly what he didn&#8217;t want, but exactly what needs to be done to guarantee security for Europe.</p>



<p>And I think it&#8217;s &#8212; I think it&#8217;s necessary, and I&#8217;m looking forward to it happening formally.</p>



<p>SECRETARY GENERAL STOLTENBERG: Thank you so much.</p>



<p>PRESIDENT BIDEN: Thank you.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Via Teleconference</p>



<p>12:06 P.M. EDT</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Thanks for joining us today.&nbsp; We wanted to take an opportunity to brief you guys.&nbsp; I know some of you had questions on the force posture announcements that were made today.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This briefing is on the record, and it is embargoed until the end of the call.&nbsp; Our speakers today are John Kirby, who many of you already know.&nbsp; And then we also have, from the Department of Defense, Celeste Wallander, who&#8217;s the Assistant Secretary for Defense for International Security Affairs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We&#8217;re going to have John Kirby start with some remarks at the top, and then Celeste Wallander will go, and then we&#8217;ll try to take as many questions as we can.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, John, over to you.</p>



<p>MR. KIRBY:&nbsp; Thank you, [moderator], and good afternoon, everybody.&nbsp; I just want to offer a couple of framing thoughts here before I turn it over to Celeste to speak in more detail about the force posture announcements that the President made today.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And the first thing is, I think it&#8217;s important to remember that today&#8217;s announcement just comes after several months of President Biden&#8217;s leadership when it comes to shoring up NATO&#8217;s eastern flank.&nbsp; And just to remind, I mean, just since the invasion itself, he ordered the deployment or extension of over 20,000 additional forces to Europe in response to the crisis, all across the domains &#8212; air, land, maritime, cyber, space, the whole swath of U.S. military capabilities &#8212; which brought our total to over 100,000 service members across Europe, up from where it was before, around 80.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, you know, to remind, that included a carrier strike group, additional fighter squadrons, an infantry brigade combat team, an armored brigade combat team, a host of enabling capabilities that went along with that, including an amphibious readiness group.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The President also ordered the entire U.S. commitment to the NATO Response Force put on heightened alert and readiness.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, of course, all of that came on top of the President&#8217;s decision to move forces around that were already in Europe, again, closer to the eastern flank, including a Stryker brigade combat team from Germany to Romania, Bulgaria, and Hungary; Patriot batteries from Germany to Slovakia; F-15s from the UK to Poland.&nbsp; All of those were already there, and the President saw fit that they needed to be moved around closer to the eastern flank to shore up that readiness and deterrence posture.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And then, all of that, of course, underscores how much the President realized, even before the invasion began, that the security environment in Europe had changed &#8212; not “was changing,” not “will change,” but “has changed.”&nbsp; And he recognized that back in the fall when he was talking to the leaders of Sweden and Finland about potential NATO accession.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That is why this particular NATO Summit is going to be so important.&nbsp; And there&#8217;s some key outcomes that we&#8217;re striving towards.&nbsp; I won&#8217;t go into great detail on all of them.&nbsp; I think you&#8217;re tracking this, but one has a new Strategic Concept, of course.&nbsp; Two, stronger deterrence and defense.&nbsp; Obviously, three, the invitation to Finland and Sweden to join the Alliance, to bring the Alliance to 32 nations.&nbsp; Greater resourcing from each of the nations, in terms of their defense spending.&nbsp; Obviously, support from Ukraine; they&#8217;re going to hear from President Zelenskyy at this summit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And then expanding and improving global partnerships.&nbsp; For the very first time, the leaders of Australia, Japan, New Zealand, and the Republic of Korea are going to participate.&nbsp; In fact, the President is going to be sitting down with the leaders of Japan and the Republic of Korea later this afternoon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, if you just look at those ma- &#8212; those six major outcomes, two of them here &#8212; before the first day is even half over, two of them have been realized: greater defense and deterrence along the eastern flank with these new announcements that the President made and, of course, now the path is clear to invite Sweden and Finland onboard the Alliance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s just an incredible amount of progress for a half a day already in the summit.&nbsp; And the President really has been at the forefront of driving these changes forward.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, with respect now to those changes on deterrence and defense, I&#8217;m going to kick it over to Celeste to walk you through a little bit more in detail, and then we&#8217;ll take some questions.</p>



<p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY WALLANDER:&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; Thanks, John.&nbsp; Happy to be here to help explain what I can and be helpful to you all.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I would just add to John&#8217;s framing that the posture decisions that are being announced today, that the President is announcing today are reflective of the United States government&#8217;s recognition that, as John said, that the security environment has changed and &#8212; in particular, in the NATO AOR &#8212; that the eastern flank countries are facing a heightened threat of a Russian leadership that has shown itself willing and capable of launching military attacks on bordering countries.</p>



<p>And the surge &#8212; crisis-surge activities and decisions that John has already laid out help to create a stronger deterrent capability and defense capability, in particular in those eastern flank countries &#8212; the eight eastern flank countries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And these decisions on posture now make those crisis-surge decisions and movements more sustainable and more combat-credible in several important respects.</p>



<p>First of all, the decision to keep a rotational Army brigade combat team in Poland and to now headquarter a Army brigade combat team in Romania creates the capability for the United States to sustain our rotational heel-to-toe presence in the eastern flank countries and in particular but not exclusively in the three Baltic countries: Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.</p>



<p>By having those two rotational BCTs located in Poland and Romania, the United States will be able to sustain the kind of surge contributions that we&#8217;ve made in the last couple of months.&nbsp; That&#8217;s number one.</p>



<p>Number two, by having those BCTs in Poland and Romania, the United States will be able to sustain for itself and for those Allies a very rigorous schedule of training, on training ranges, particularly in Romania, but also in Poland.</p>



<p>U.S. forces rotating in Europe will be able to maintain a very high readiness level because we will have those BCTs in Romania and in Poland.&nbsp; And we will have, therefore, a higher level of interoperability with NATO Allies by being able to train with them in the European AOR on a regular basis.</p>



<p>And those forces then &#8212; third, and along the same lines &#8212; will support robust exercises &#8212; both NATO and other multilateral exercises &#8212; which, again, enhance interoperability and sustain a high level of readiness.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s those elements of credible combat capability that is really important for sending a message of effective defense capabilities and, therefore, effective deterrence.&nbsp; So that&#8217;s, sort of, the first framing about the importance of the BCTs in Poland and in Romania.</p>



<p>On top of that, as you&#8217;ve seen in the factsheet, the United States has decided to permanently forward station the V Corps headquarters Forward Command Post and Army Garrison headquarters and Field Support Battalion in Poland.</p>



<p>This is a significant decision precisely because of the changed security environment and the recognition that the United States needs to have a longer-term capability to sustain our presence, our training, our activities, and our support to the countries of the eastern flank, both bilaterally and through the NATO battle groups &#8212; battle groups which are in those eight forward flank countries.</p>



<p>So the key element of American ability to sustain now this new world in which NATO (inaudible) defense and deterrence combat capability is forward in those eight flank countries is our bilateral relationship with Poland.&nbsp; And I want to highlight how important our bilateral relationship with Poland is.</p>



<p>Poland is a strong NATO Ally.&nbsp; It has made its own decisions on increasing defense spending, on increasing its own combat capability, on modernizing its defense forces.&nbsp; And so, the bilateral partnership that the United States has and the enhanced presence we will now have in Poland supports then the broader NATO capabilities.</p>



<p>And finally, I just want to point to a number of the non-ground forces &#8212; capabilities that are part of this posture decision.&nbsp; Specifically, the increase of destroyers that will be based in Rota, Spain, from four to six.&nbsp; And there are many I could point to in the factsheet, but I would also point to the significant air defense and air domain capabilities that will come along with these new posture changes to support the broader package of U.S. combat credibility in the NATO AOR.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So let me stop there and take your questions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi.&nbsp; Thanks for doing the call.&nbsp; I just want to clarify the number of groups that are going to be in the rotational presence in Romania.&nbsp; The President said during his meeting with Jens Stoltenberg that there&#8217;ll be 3,000 fighters and then 2,000 personnel.&nbsp; So is that 5,000 total personnel, including 3,000 fighters?&nbsp; Can you please clarify that figure?&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY WALLANDER:&nbsp; Hi.&nbsp; Yeah, I can&#8217;t get in &#8212; I won&#8217;t get into the precise numbers of a brigade combat team.&nbsp; Those precise numbers can vary depending on whether it’s, you know, on the exact formation of the combat team.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So I would, I would stick with: The presence of a brigade combat team headquartered in Romania with available elements, whether that be company, battalion, or other size enablers connected to that brigade combat team that will be available for a rotational presence.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey, Celeste.&nbsp; And, John, thanks for doing this.&nbsp; I think these are for you, but, John, if you want to jump in.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So you used the word “permanent.”&nbsp; Obviously, for the Fifth Corps in Poland, you used that word twice.&nbsp; Does that mean that U.S. policy has now concluded the NATO-Russia Founding Act &#8212; in which NATO promised not to station troops in Eastern European permanently &#8212; no longer applies?&nbsp; Because I&#8217;m pretty sure &#8212; and I think the factsheet points this out &#8212; you haven&#8217;t used that word before.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And you don&#8217;t use “permanent” again in the Baltics.&nbsp; You use, you know, persistent “heel-to-toe,” as we&#8217;ve been using.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And then on Romania, just a clarification: Making sure this is a U.S. BCT, not a U.S.-led NATO battlegroup that happens to be a brigade size.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thanks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY WALLANDER:&nbsp; Right.&nbsp; Both good questions.&nbsp; On &#8212; and I’ll &#8212; also, I’m sure John has (inaudible), but I &#8212; the NATO-Russia Founding Act makes a commitment for no substantial combat forces.&nbsp; And therefore, the decision to permanently forward station the V Corps Headquarters forward command post does not &#8212; you know, it’s consistent with that commitment and our understanding of the NATO-Russia Founding Act.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let me just check and make sure that&#8217;s John&#8217;s understanding as well, but that&#8217;s our understanding at DOD, I believe.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MR. KIRBY:&nbsp; Yes, of course.</p>



<p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY WALLANDER:&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the BCT that will be deployed &#8212; positioned in Romania: That is a U.S. bilateral contribution.&nbsp; It is &#8212; it does not replace or &#8212; the framework nation for the NATO battlegroup in Romania is France.&nbsp; And France &#8212; we support France&#8217;s leadership in that battlegroup.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That BCT could, in principle, be available for resourcing support to that battlegroup, you know, in future.&nbsp; We haven’t made any decisions along those lines.&nbsp; We would need to talk to France about that.&nbsp; But it is &#8212; it is separate from the French-led NATO battlegroup.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, thank you.&nbsp; What is the bottom line of how many new U.S. troops are part of this announcement?&nbsp; We just heard there&#8217;s about 100,000 U.S. troops in Europe currently.&nbsp; How many new troops will be part of this, and where are they coming from?</p>



<p>And lastly, how do these new troops fit into the 300,000 NATO Response Force troops that the Secretary announced the other day?</p>



<p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY WALLANDER:&nbsp; So I can&#8217;t get into the total numbers that would add up from the force posture decisions, nor where they&#8217;re coming from for security and operational planning reasons.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think we&#8217;ll be able to give numbers in the future as we, you know, identify the specific units.&nbsp; This &#8212; these force posture changes will take place over the coming months.&nbsp; But at this point, you know, we can&#8217;t really give you specific numbers on any of those questions, I&#8217;m afraid.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks for doing this.&nbsp; So, under your agreements with Russia, you are obliged to sort of notify these kinds of changes &#8212; any force posture changes.&nbsp; Has that happened?&nbsp; The Russians are saying that they haven&#8217;t received formal notification.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And can you also just &#8212; I realize you can&#8217;t give us numbers per se at this point.&nbsp; But can you give us a ballpark?&nbsp; Will it add thousands, tens of thousands?&nbsp; Just so we&#8217;ve got a, sort of, a ballpark figure.&nbsp; Thanks so much.</p>



<p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY WALLANDER:&nbsp; So, on the numbers, let me validate whether we can give you a ballpark number, because I don&#8217;t want to &#8212; I&#8217;m looking at the factsheet, and if I start adding up the numbers in my head, my math may go sideways.</p>



<p>On the requirement to notify Russia about changes in U.S. posture, I&#8217;m not tracking what agreement &#8212; what legally binding agreement we have with Russia that would require us to notify force posture changes.&nbsp; So can you either clarify or &#8212; I just &#8212; I don&#8217;t believe we are aware of one.&nbsp; But, again, I would defer to John if he&#8217;s aware of one.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MR. KIRBY:&nbsp; No, I know of no requirement to inform the Russians.&nbsp; I mean, we added &#8212; over the last several months, as I said, we went from around 80,000 to 100,000 troops in Europe, most of them, obviously, in a rotational, temporary basis, and there was no notification requirement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We were very public about those decisions as we made them, and we&#8217;re being public about these decisions as we make them now.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay, so there is no legal requirement, to your understanding?</p>



<p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY WALLANDER:&nbsp; There is no &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And has there been any communication direct &#8212;</p>



<p>MR. KIRBY:&nbsp; There has been no communication with Moscow about these changes, nor is there a requirement to do that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, again, back to Celeste’s point: You know, the vast, vast majority of these force posture changes we&#8217;re making are, as she described them, “heel-to-toe” rotational deployments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, the presence will stay persistent, but it won&#8217;t always be the same brigade combat team for years and years and years or &#8212; or any other aircraft squadron.&nbsp; They&#8217;ll be the &#8212; we&#8217;re setting this up in such a way that we can rotationally deploy at higher levels in Europe than we had before the invasion.</p>



<p>Q    Yes.  Thank you so much, guys, for doing this call.  As you think about the American-made weaponry that&#8217;s going to be dispatched around the region &#8212; obviously, there&#8217;s a very high stakes meeting with President Erdoğan later today.  And I&#8217;m wondering how the U.S. sees the potential sale of F-16s to Turkey &#8212; whether it has strategic merit in the times that we&#8217;re living in, and how the U.S. is thinking about it going into that meeting.  Thanks.</p>



<p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY WALLANDER:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; The &#8212; you know, Turkey is a highly capable, highly valued, strategic NATO Ally.&nbsp; And Turkish defense capability &#8212; strong Turkish defense capabilities contribute to strong NATO defense capabilities.</p>



<p>So, the U.S. Department of Defense fully supports Turkey&#8217;s modernization plans for its F-16 fleet.&nbsp; The &#8212; these plans are in the works.&nbsp;&nbsp; And, you know, they need to be worked through our contracting processes.&nbsp; But the United States supports Turkey’s modernization of its fighter fleet because that is a contribution to NATO security and therefore American security.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Two quick questions.&nbsp; Do we know yet if President Zelenskyy has addressed the leaders?&nbsp; And if so, can someone give us a feel on what he may have said?</p>



<p>And second, in the opening, I think it was John Kirby who mentioned the Strategic Concept.&nbsp; Can &#8212; is there any insight anyone can share into what language the United States is seeking in the Strategic Concept as it relates to China?</p>



<p>MR. KIRBY:&nbsp; Let me take the Strategic Concept one real quick, and then I&#8217;ll defer to Celeste on President Zelenskyy because I think she&#8217;s on site.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But it&#8217;s &#8212; there hasn&#8217;t been an updated Strategic Concept since 2010.&nbsp; And the world was much different in 2010 than it is in 2022.&nbsp; And so, obviously, all leaders believe it&#8217;s time to update the document and to make sure that it outlines NATO&#8217;s transformation with respect to the 2030 agenda that was adopted in last year&#8217;s summit.&nbsp; So it&#8217;s &#8212; it&#8217;s going to help guide efforts to safeguard our security &#8212; Euro-Atlantic security in response to Russia&#8217;s aggressions clearly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But it&#8217;s also going to mention for the first time the system &#8212; systemic challenges that are posed by China.&nbsp; And quite frankly, the deepening strategic partnership that we see evolving between Russia and China and how that affects our allies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I mean, I won&#8217;t get ahead of the exact language.&nbsp; But clearly, our Allies have likewise been concerned about this growing, burgeoning relationship between Russia and China.&nbsp; They have growing concerns about China&#8217;s unfair trade practices, use of forced labor, theft of intellectual property, and their bullying and coercive activities not just in the Indo-Pacific, but around the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And again, I won&#8217;t get ahead of the exact language, but it is significant that for the first time a Strategic Concept from NATO will specifically mention China.</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; And in regards to the President Zelenskyy question, he is set to speak at the session one, which is ongoing.&nbsp; We&#8217;re going to endeavor to read out that session to you all after it&#8217;s over.&nbsp; So, look out for that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anyways, thanks again for joining.&nbsp; As a reminder, this call was on the record.&nbsp; The embargo of the contents of this call lifts after the call ends.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thanks for joining.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>The June 29-30, 2022 NATO Summit in Madrid, Spain will be an historic moment for the Transatlantic Alliance. Building on the President’s first NATO Summit on June 14, 2021, and extraordinary Summits held on February 25, 2022 and March 24, 2022 in response to Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine, this Summit in Madrid will convene all 30 Allied leaders and key NATO partners from Europe and Asia. For the first time, it will include NATO’s Asia-Pacific partners at the leaders level. The Summit will provide an opportunity to advance collective efforts with these Allies and partners to strengthen the rules-based international order. President Biden will reaffirm the United States’ unwavering commitment to the Transatlantic bond and NATO’s Article 5 – that an attack on one is an attack on all. Alongside major new contributions from Allies, the President will also announce at the Summit new stationing of U.S. forces and capabilities in Europe to support NATO and to deter any aggression against our Allies.<br><br>Key Summit Outcomes:<br><br><strong>A New Strategic Concept: </strong>Allied leaders will endorse NATO’s next Strategic Concept, the first update since 2010 for this key public document which describes how NATO will address threats and challenges in its security environment in coming years. The new Strategic Concept outlines NATO’s transformation in line with the NATO 2030 agenda adopted at the 2021 Summit. It will also guide efforts to safeguard Euro-Atlantic security in response to Russia’s aggression, as well as the systemic challenges posed by the People’s Republic of China, and the deepening strategic partnership between Russia and China. The Strategic Concept outlines NATO’s core tasks as deterrence and defense, crisis prevention and management, and cooperative security. It will ensure NATO continues to develop appropriate tools and collective responses to transnational threats such as cyber attacks and the security implications of climate change, and recognizes the value of a human security approach to NATO’s work, such as the protection of civilians during conflict, and preventing and responding to conflict-related sexual violence.<br><br><strong>Stronger Deterrence and Defense: </strong>In response to the more dangerous European security environment caused by Russia’s aggression against Ukraine, NATO activated its defensive plans and over 40,000 troops are now under direct NATO command. Allies have also doubled NATO’s battlegroups on the eastern flank, ensuring strong defense from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea. At the Summit, Allied leaders will endorse a new strengthened defensive force posture, with a 360-degree view across land, air, sea, cyber, and space, and an emphasis on more combat-credible forward capabilities on the eastern flank. Leaders will also take decisions to strengthen NATO’s posture, readiness, and interoperability through more identified reinforcements and an enhanced exercise program.&nbsp;<br><br>In response to Russia’s aggression against Ukraine, and in order to ensure the defense of our Allies, the United States deployed or extended over 20,000 additional forces to Europe, and there are currently approximately 100,000 U.S. forces providing defense and deterrence throughout Europe. The United States will continue to adjust its posture as needed in response to the dynamic security environment. In close cooperation with our Allies and hosting nations, President Biden announced today that the United States will take the following additional actions to strengthen NATO’s deterrence and defense and European security:</p>



<ul><li>Establishment of a permanent V Corps Headquarters Forward Command Post in Poland, which will improve U.S.-NATO interoperability across the eastern flank.</li><li>Commitment to maintaining an additional rotational Brigade Combat Team in Europe, which the United States will position in Romania, with the ability to deploy subordinate elements for training and exercises across the eastern flank.</li><li>Enhanced rotational deployments in the Baltic region including armored, aviation, air defense, and special operations forces, building further interoperability and intensified training with these Allies, and enhancing our ability to quickly reinforce and provide combat-credible defenses. We will maintain a persistent, heel-to-toe presence in the region and will intensify training with our Baltic Allies.</li><li>An agreement to work with Spain to increase the number of U.S. destroyers stationed in Rota from four to six.</li><li>Two squadrons of F-35 aircraft to the United Kingdom.</li><li>Stationing of additional air defense and other enablers in Germany and Italy.</li></ul>



<p>Our Allies are stepping up as well, and have significantly enhanced their contributions to NATO through identified reinforcements and establishment of new combat-credible structures able to scale up to brigade size across the eastern flank. &nbsp;Our Allies will make additional announcements during the Summit on their contributions to NATO, demonstrating their support for shared responsibility for defense and security within the Transatlantic Alliance. We salute all our men and women in uniform from across North America and Europe who continue to serve daily to keep us safe.<br><br><strong>Membership Invitations for Finland and Sweden:&nbsp;</strong>On May 18, Finland and Sweden made the sovereign decision to apply for NATO membership, demonstrating the continued importance of NATO’s Open Door policy, which provides a path to membership for any European state in a position to further the principles of the Washington Treaty and to contribute to the security of the North Atlantic area. The United States welcomes the trilateral agreement signed on June 28 by Turkey, Sweden, and Finland that will pave the way for NATO leaders to issue an invitation during the Summit to Sweden and Finland. The United States strongly supports the applications by Sweden and Finland and has prepared all necessary materials for the U.S. Congress to carry out their advice and consent responsibilities, once accession talks have concluded and Allies sign the accession protocols, which is expected to occur in the coming days.<br><br><strong>Greater Resourcing for NATO: </strong>Allies submitted updated plans ahead of the Summit on their efforts to meet their commitment under the Wales Pledge to increase national defense expenditures and major equipment procurement. 2022 is projected to be the eighth consecutive year of increased defense spending by non-U.S. Allies, and many Allies now spend well above NATO’s benchmark of 2 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), which is increasingly seen as a floor and not a ceiling. Nine Allies will meet or exceed this commitment this year, 19 Allies have clear plans to meet it by 2024, and an additional five Allies have made concrete commitments to meet it thereafter. By the end of 2022, European Allies and Canada will have spent an additional $350 billion on defense in real terms since 2014. At the Summit, leaders will also decide on significant increases over coming years to NATO’s commonly-funded military and civilian budgets and security investment program, which will enhance the Alliance’s ability to do more together in support of our common security and defense.<br><br><strong>Support for Ukraine</strong>: At the Summit, Allied leaders will hear directly from Ukrainian President Zelenskyy and discuss their ongoing efforts to provide Ukraine with security, humanitarian, and economic assistance. The United States has led the world, providing since the start of the Biden Administration more than $6.3 billion in security assistance to support Ukraine’s right to defend itself.&nbsp; In order to better support Ukraine’s short and long-term needs, Allies will launch with Ukraine at the Summit an updated NATO Comprehensive Assistance Package for Ukraine, the mechanism by which NATO provides non-lethal assistance and support for defense reforms in Ukraine.<br><br><strong>Expanded Global Partnerships</strong>: For the first time ever, the leaders of Australia, Japan, New Zealand, and the Republic of Korea will participate in a NATO Summit. Allies and these Asia-Pacific partners will initiate a roadmap for expanded cooperation, ensuring closer political consultation and joint work on issues of mutual interest, including cyber and hybrid threats, maritime security, counterterrorism, and the impact of climate change on security. In recognition of the mutually-reinforcing roles of NATO and the EU in bolstering Euro-Atlantic and international security, the presidents of the European Council and European Commission will join the Summit’s discussions and the Transatlantic dinner hosted by Spain. Allies will also consult with Georgia to express support for its sovereignty, territorial integrity, and Euro-Atlantic aspirations. Allies will also approve expanded programs to support the defensive needs of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, and the Republic of Moldova.</p>



<p><strong>Safeguarding Democratic Values and Institutions</strong>: NATO’s founding treaty and its day-to-day work to secure our citizens make clear that NATO Allies are strongest when they stand united in their respect for the principles of democracy, individual liberty, and the rule of law. NATO’s Parliamentary Assembly has highlighted the importance of democratic resilience to NATO’s strength and unity, and the United States is working with Allies to support and bolster these efforts. At the Summit, leaders will receive a Progress Report on the Implementation of NATO’s successful Building Integrity program, which promotes transparency and reform in the defense and security sectors. The report also tasks NATO to continue working with Allies and partners to address good governance and the impact of corruption as key elements of the Alliance’s broader political and security agenda.</p>



<p><strong>Strengthened Cyber Resilience and Defense: </strong>Building on last year’s adoption of a new Cyber Defense Policy for NATO, Allied leaders will endorse a new action plan to strengthen cyber cooperation across the political, military, and technical levels. As an operational domain for NATO, cyber will also be a key component of NATO’s strengthened deterrence and defense posture. Building on lessons learned from the conflict in Ukraine, Allies will decide at the Summit to use NATO as a coordination platform for offering national assets to build and exercise a virtual rapid response cyber capability to respond to a serious cyber-attack. The United States will offer robust national capabilities as part of this support network.</p>



<p><strong>Preserving our Technological Edge: </strong>Leaders will offer pledges to help stand up a new Defense Innovation Accelerator for the North Atlantic<strong>, </strong>which will support NATO’s efforts to boost interoperability and ensure that every Ally has access to cutting-edge technological solutions for military needs. The U.S. will contribute by facilitating access to U.S. entities, such as test centers and accelerator sites, drawn from across the extensive and diverse U.S. innovation sector.<br><br><strong>Combating Climate Change and Promoting Energy Resilience: </strong>Ahead of the Summit, NATO hosted its first-ever high-level dialogue on climate change and related security implications. The U.S. has been a leader in the alliance on spurring NATO’s adaptation to these issues, including by mainstreaming climate considerations in intelligence analysis and assisting with development of a methodology for mapping the NATO enterprise’s greenhouse gas emissions. As part of implementing NATO’s new climate change and security action plan and reducing energy dependence, the United States will also continue to work with Allies to promote best practices for reducing energy demand in military procurement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>For years, the United States has invested in research on monkeypox and in tools to effectively respond to the disease. Monkeypox is a virus that is generally spread through close or intimate contact, with symptoms that include a rash and fever. It is much less transmissible than fast-spreading respiratory diseases like COVID-19, and this outbreak has not caused any deaths in the United States. &nbsp;The virus, however, is spreading in the United States and globally, and requires a comprehensive response from federal, state, local, and international governments and communities. Since the first United States case was confirmed on May 18, President Biden has taken critical actions to make vaccines, testing, and treatments available to those who need them as part of its whole-of-government monkeypox outbreak response.</p>



<p>Today, the Biden-Harris Administration announced the first phase of its national monkeypox vaccine strategy, a critical part of its monkeypox outbreak response. The vaccine strategy will help immediately address the spread of the virus by providing vaccines across the country to individuals at high risk. This phase of the strategy aims to rapidly deploy vaccines in the most affected communities and mitigate the spread of the disease.</p>



<p>This announcement is a critical component of the Administration’s broader public health response, which includes rapidly scaling up and decentralizing testing alongside continued provider education and community engagement across the country. The Administration’s monkeypox outbreak response is also informed by the multiple times over the last twenty years that the United States has effectively responded to the virus. The United States government’s response is coordinated by the National Security Council Directorate on Global Health Security and Biodefense – more commonly known as the White House Pandemic Office – which President Biden restored on day one of his presidency, in collaboration with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).</p>



<p>Collectively, the Administration’s efforts aim to <strong>expand vaccination for individuals at risk</strong> and <strong>make testing more convenient for healthcare providers and patients across the country</strong>. The Biden-Harris Administration remains committed to working with urgency to detect more cases, protect those at risk, and respond rapidly to the outbreak.</p>



<p><strong>Scaling and Delivering Vaccines to Mitigate New Infections</strong>: Thanks to prior investments in health security and the nation’s prior experience responding to the monkeypox virus, the United States has effective vaccines and treatments that can be used against monkeypox. To date, HHS has received requests from 32 states and jurisdictions, deploying over 9,000 doses of vaccine and 300 courses of antiviral smallpox treatments. <strong>With today’s national monkeypox vaccine strategy, the United States is significantly expanding deployment of vaccines</strong><strong>, allocating 296,000 doses over the coming weeks, 56,000 of which will be allocated immediately. Over the coming months a combined 1.6 million additional doses will become available.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Making Testing Easier</strong>: The new national monkeypox vaccine strategy builds on the Administration’s efforts to make testing more widely available and easier to access. On day one of this outbreak, providers had access to a high-quality, FDA-cleared test to detect monkeypox. The CDC has since scaled testing capacity to 78 sites in 48 states, primarily at state public health laboratories, with spare capacity to conduct nearly 10,000 tests per week nationwide. <strong>Last week, CDC </strong><a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2022/06/22/hhs-expanding-monkeypox-testing-capacity-five-commercial-laboratory-companies.html"><strong>began shipping&nbsp; tests to five commercial laboratory companies</strong></a><strong>, including some of the nation’s largest reference laboratories, to further increase monkeypox testing capacity and access in every community. </strong><strong>This action will dramatically improve convenience for patients and health care providers across the nation.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Activating Community Leaders and Stakeholders</strong>: The response to monkeypox requires a whole-of-society effort between federal, state, territorial, and local governments and communities. The Biden-Harris Administration is communicating with healthcare providers, public health officials, and affected communities on a daily basis to share information on what the virus is, how to treat it, and which communities are most at risk. The Administration is also sharing information on how to access testing, treatments, and vaccines, and how to prevent transmission with local, government, and community leaders in geographies and communities where transmission rates have been the highest. The Administration is grateful for the leadership and activism of advocates in the LGBTQI+ community who have thus far been most affected and have quickly mobilized to promote information and awareness.</p>



<p><strong><u>The </u></strong><strong><u>Biden-Harris Administration is</u></strong> <strong><u>providing vaccines to protect high-risk groups across America.</u></strong></p>



<p>As part of the monkeypox outbreak response, the Biden-Harris Administration is launching a national strategy to provide vaccines for monkeypox for individuals at higher risk of exposure. The strategy aims to mitigate the spread of the virus in communities where transmission has been the highest and with populations most at risk. This plan distributes the two-dose <a href="https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/jynneos">JYNNEOS</a> vaccine, which the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for protection against smallpox and monkeypox in individuals 18 years and older determined to be at high risk for smallpox or monkeypox infection. States will be offered an equitable allotment based on cases and proportion of the population at risk for severe disease from monkeypox, and the federal government will partner with state, local, and territorial governments in deploying the vaccines.</p>



<p>The goal of the initial phase of the strategy is to slow the spread of the disease. HHS will immediately allocate 56,000 vaccine doses currently in the Strategic National Stockpile to states and territories across the country, prioritizing jurisdictions with the highest number of cases and population at risk. To date, vaccines have been provided only to those who have a confirmed monkeypox exposure. With these doses, CDC is recommending that vaccines be provided to individuals with confirmed monkeypox exposures and presumed exposures. This includes those who had close physical contact with someone diagnosed with monkeypox, those who know their sexual partner was diagnosed with monkeypox, and men who have sex with men who have recently had multiple sex partners in a venue where there was known to be monkeypox or in an area where monkeypox is spreading.</p>



<p>In the coming weeks, HHS expects to receive an additional 240,000 vaccines, which will be made available to a broader population of individuals at risk. HHS will hold another 60,000 vaccines in reserve.</p>



<p>As additional doses are received from the manufacturer, HHS will make them available to jurisdictions to expand availability to the vaccine for individuals with elevated risk. HHS is increasing the availability of doses by leveraging its long-standing partnership with the manufacturer of JYNNEOS to expand vaccine supply and by accelerating completion and shipment of doses to the United States. &nbsp;HHS expects more than 750,000 doses to be made available over the summer. An additional 500,000 doses will undergo completion, inspection, and release throughout the fall, totaling 1.6 million doses available this year.</p>



<p>To supplement the supply of JYNNEOS, states and territories may also request a second vaccine, <a href="https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/vaccines/acam2000">ACAM2000</a>. ACAM2000 is FDA-approved for protection against smallpox, caused by the variola virus. ACAM2000 is also believed to confer protection against monkeypox, and is available under an expanded access investigational new drug protocol sponsored by CDC for vaccination of individuals at risk of monkeypox infection. However, ACAM2000 <a href="https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/vaccines/acam2000-smallpox-vaccine-questions-and-answers">carries greater risk of certain serious side effects</a> than JYNNEOS and cannot be provided to individuals who are immunocompromised or who have heart disease. The CDC will work with state, territorial, and local health departments requesting the ACAM2000 vaccine to ensure that individuals are fully informed on the benefits and the risks before receiving the vaccine.</p>



<p>HHS will work closely with local and state partners and health providers to continuously evolve and strengthen its vaccine strategy to ensure that vaccines are being made available to communities most at risk and where transmission has been highest.</p>



<p><strong><u>The Administration is expanding testing supply and availability.</u></strong></p>



<p>Last week, CDC began shipping its FDA-cleared orthopox test to five major commercial laboratory companies to rapidly increase monkeypox testing access across the country. This action will dramatically expand testing capacity nationwide and convenience for patients and health care providers. These laboratories will begin to come on board for testing in early July and increase capacity through the month.</p>



<p>This expansion reflects the latest, most significant increase in testing accessibility, building on the capacities already available within the Laboratory Response Network (LRN). CDC has worked with the LRN to increase public health testing capacity by more than 50% since the start of the outbreak, increasing testing capacity from 6,000 tests per week to approximately 10,000 test per week. This network continues to provide spare testing capacity to jurisdictions across the country. CDC is working with state, territorial, and local health departments to make the monkeypox testing process more accessible to health care providers.</p>



<p>To further expand access to testing early in the outbreak, CDC published its protocol from their <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/lab-personnel/lab-procedures.html">FDA-cleared test</a> on June 9, 2022 for any laboratory to test for monkeypox. The FDA is exercising enforcement discretion regarding CDC’s tests, which permits the use of tests beyond the current network. FDA has also authorized the use of additional reagents and automation to increase the capacity of laboratories using the CDC test.</p>



<p>Since the start of the monkeypox outbreak, the number of days from average symptom onset to test has decreased by approximately 35%, enabling patients to more quickly learn their diagnosis, access care, and prevent spread to others. The expansion of testing aims to facilitate further reductions in the gap between symptom onset and test result, maximizing access to treatment and vaccines for patients and high-risk contacts early in the course of disease.</p>



<p><strong><u>The Administration has launched a robust community and stakeholder engagement strategy.</u></strong></p>



<p>The most effective response to infectious disease outbreaks is a community-based response. The Biden-Harris Administration is communicating with healthcare providers, public health officials, and communities on a daily basis to raise awareness of the monkeypox outbreak and educate the public and local and community leaders about what the virus is, how it is transmitted, and which populations are most at risk of the virus. As part of its robust engagement strategy, the Administration is facilitating access to vaccines, treatments, and tests. The Administration will also continue to engage directly with leaders and stakeholders in the LGBTQI+ community to work together to prevent and combat stigma and bias, and promote testing and vaccine access and health equity for LGBTQI+ communities. Through its comprehensive stakeholder engagement strategy, the Administration is also creating a critical feedback loop &#8211; learning from the experiences of those most at risk and responding based on their insights and needs.</p>



<p>HHS has provided a range of public health information to inform providers and high-risk communities, including:</p>



<ul><li>Updating and expanding the monkeypox case definition by June 1<sup>st</sup> to encourage health care providers to consider testing for all rashes with clinical suspicion for monkeypox;</li><li>Releasing emergency information on May 20<sup>th</sup> and June 14<sup>th</sup> covering clinical testing, treatment, contact tracing, and other topics to health providers, sexual and community health centers, and public health officials across the nation;</li><li>Providing over 570 case consultations to healthcare providers and health departments;</li><li>Clarifying how to transport and dispose of medical waste that allowed healthcare facilities and waste management companies to operate confidently and safely; and,</li><li>Regularly speaking with global, community, clinical, and public health stakeholders to solve challenges and answer questions.</li></ul>



<p>HHS and CDC will continue to engage with the public and communities most impacted and at risk on a daily basis throughout the response.</p>



<p><strong><u>The Administration is leading efforts to combat monkeypox globally</u></strong></p>



<p>There is no domestic-only response to a global outbreak. The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to combatting monkeypox in the United States and around the world, including in countries where it has been historically endemic. The United States has also supported international efforts to combat monkeypox in endemic countries for years, including in Nigeria and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The Biden-Harris Administration is dedicated to assisting endemic and non-endemic countries combat their outbreaks and is exploring options to further support the international response.</p>



<p>The Administration is also developing key U.S. monkeypox research and evidence priorities, led by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, to drive efforts to improve our arsenal of medical countermeasures, strengthen real-time monitoring, enhance our understanding of the monkeypox virus, and energize the broader U.S. and global scientific community around urgent monkeypox research and evidence challenges.</p>



<p>The Biden Administration has been responding to the outbreak since the first domestic case was identified with urgency, humility, and transparency, adapting our approach as we learn more about how this virus is spreading. It will continue to ensure a whole-of-government response to the monkeypox outbreak moving forward, and will lead the government in adapting our response as the situation develops.</p>

<p>I congratulate Turkey, Finland and Sweden on signing a trilateral memorandum, which paves the way for Allies to invite Finland and Sweden to join NATO at the Madrid Summit. When I welcomed President Niinistö and Prime Minister Andersson to the White House last month, I told them that the United States strongly supports their membership. Finland and Sweden are strong democracies with highly capable militaries. Their membership will strengthen NATO’s collective security and benefit the entire Transatlantic Alliance. I look forward to working with NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg, our Allies, and with Congress to ensure that we can quickly welcome them into our Alliance. As we begin this historic NATO Summit in Madrid, our Alliance is stronger, more united and more resolute than ever.</p>

<p>Today, Julie Chavez Rodriguez, White House Intergovernmental Affairs Director, Jennifer Klein, White House Gender Policy Council Director, and Stacey Grigsby, Deputy White House Counsel, met with Attorneys General Dana Nessel of Michigan and Keith Ellison of Minnesota to discuss efforts underway in key states to protect reproductive rights. Vice President Harris later joined the meeting and reaffirmed the Administration’s commitment to fighting for reproductive rights. The Vice President discussed the pivotal role that Attorneys General play in safeguarding the rights of the people of their states, and she encouraged them to continue to use their authority to defend reproductive rights and freedoms.</p>



<p>Both Attorneys General have taken significant action to protect access to abortion. Attorney General Nessel pledged not to deploy state resources to enforce Michigan’s 1931 abortion ban, a relic of an era before <em>Roe</em> was decided.

<p class="has-text-align-center">Palace of Moncloa<br>Madrid, Spain</p>



<p>6:02 P.M. CEST</p>



<p>KING FELIPE VI:&nbsp; Mr. President, welcome.&nbsp; Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>(Speaks Spanish.)&nbsp; (No translation provided.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mr. President, as I said earlier on when I welcomed you at the Torrejón Air Force Base, it is truly a wel- &#8212; a pleasure to welcome you to Spain, to our nation&#8217;s capital, Madrid.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve had the opportunity actually to meet on previous occasions, in our previous capacities as well.</p>



<p>PRESIDENT BIDEN:&nbsp; (Laughs.)</p>



<p>KING FELIPE VI:&nbsp; And I always treasure those opportunities in my memory.&nbsp; And we&#8217;ve had chances to talk about things in the past, and I really look forward to that on this occasion as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Kingdom of Spain and the United States of America share profound historical and cultural ties &#8212; we all know that inside out &#8212; and we&#8217;re very proud of them.</p>



<p>But more importantly, we share common values and principles that are, today, the foundation of a rich and wide-ranging relationship and a sincere friendship which we highly value and which we want to continue strengthening every day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>President Biden and his delegation, with Secretary Blinken ahead of it &#8212; to which will also extend a warm welcome &#8212; are visiting us to attend a very important NATO Summit here in Madrid.&nbsp; This is without &#8212; without a doubt an especially relevant summit, one in which the Allied countries must continue to show unity and determination to defend our freedom and our democratic values.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mr. President, Queen Letizia and I, our government, the Spanish people are all delighted to have you here with us, together with your delegation and together with your wife, the First Lady, Dr. Jill Biden.&nbsp; And we wish you a very happy, albeit short, stay in Madrid.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thank you very much.</p>



<p>PRESIDENT BIDEN:&nbsp; Thank you very much.&nbsp; Well, thank you your Majesty.&nbsp; There’s an old expression in a little town in Delaware called Claymont, Delaware, a little steel town.&nbsp; And they say, “We’re like poor relatives.&nbsp; We show up when we’re invited and we stay longer than we should.”&nbsp; So, be careful.&nbsp; We may not go back.&nbsp;</p>



<p>KING FELIPE VI:&nbsp; (Laughs.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>PRESIDENT BIDEN:&nbsp; This is my second opportunity to be in this magnificent facility.&nbsp; And it’s &#8212; the royal palace is just incredible.</p>



<p>And notwithstanding the magni- &#8212; the majesty of this palace, we do have &#8212; share the same values.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, some suggest we wouldn’t be an independent country were not for you guys some years ago.&nbsp; And &#8212; but I’ve travelled to Madrid as Vice President.&nbsp; And, quite frankly, it’s wonderful to return here again to discuss the consequences of what particularly is happening today in the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is &#8212; we’re at a moment of historical &#8212; an inflection point in American &#8212; in world history.&nbsp; Things are changing.&nbsp; They’re changing drastically not only in terms of the politics of the world, but everything from pandemic diseases to dealing with &#8212; dealing with everything from climate change.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so, I want to thank you for hosting this NATO meeting because it’s been 40 years &#8212; 40 years now you’ve all been members of NATO.&nbsp; And we’re all better off for it.&nbsp; All of us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And today, NATO is united and as united and galvanized as, I believe, it’s ever been.&nbsp; And we’re ready to face the threats of Russian aggression because, quite frankly, there’s no choice.&nbsp; It’s been a &#8212; the most significant abuse of power since World War Two and an invasion of that many people under another country in Europe.&nbsp; Some people thought that was not likely to happen again, but it did.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But we responded.&nbsp; We responded in unison.&nbsp; And when we agreed we were going to respond, we acknowledged there was going to be some costs to our people.&nbsp; They were going to &#8212; in us im- &#8212; our imposition of sanctions on Russia.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But our people have stood together.&nbsp; They stood up and they’ve stood strong.&nbsp; And, you know, as I told President Sánchez, who I met with a moment ago, that &#8212; I want to thank you, your Highness, for &#8212; for the support of the Spanish people &#8212; and not only as it relates to what is going on in Europe and &#8212; but what&#8217;s happening in North Africa, as well as Latin America.&nbsp; The help and support and the &#8212; the input has been extremely valuable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You know, I tell people that the idea &#8212; we&#8217;ve always &#8212; we&#8217;ve had great migration flows into the United States over the years.&nbsp; We’re &#8212; we’re a nation of immigrants.&nbsp; But an interesting statistic, your Highness, that &#8212; I think it’s 24 out of every 100 students in grade 1 through 12 in America speaks Spanish &#8212; speaks Spanish as their original language.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so, the future of my country depends considerably on the assimilation of a population that is going to have all the same values that we possess and have.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And your help in Latin America is also extremely important and I look forward to &#8212; from here to &#8212; and Europe to Latin America to &#8212; to the Caribbean to Africa.&nbsp; The partnership between our countries is going to determine a good large part how well things look 10 years from now and 15 years from now.</p>



<p>So we have to stay together.&nbsp; The &#8212; the unity is important.&nbsp; And I think we’re off to a very, very good start demonstrating the power of democracies in the second quarter of the 21st century, because there is &#8212; there is a contest between autocracies and democracies, and we have to succeed.&nbsp; And I&#8217;m confident we will with your help.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Palace of Moncloa<br>Madrid, Spain</p>



<p>5:23 P.M. CEST</p>



<p>PRESIDENT SÁNCHEZ:&nbsp; Good afternoon, and welcome to Madrid.&nbsp; I would like to &#8212; to start by thanking President Biden for coming to Spain to participate in the Madrid NATO Summit.&nbsp; I&#8217;m also very, very glad to welcome you in the Moncloa Palace in your first visit as President of the United States.</p>



<p>(Speaks Spanish.)&nbsp; (As interpreted.)&nbsp; Spain and the U.S. are allies.&nbsp; We are strategic partners.&nbsp; We are friends.&nbsp; We are linked together by strong historical bonds and strong partnership in many topics.</p>



<p>Moreover, we share that desire to promote the principles of freedom, democracy, human rights, gender equality, and the state of law.&nbsp; And after over 20 years since the declaration that was signed by the Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and the then-Foreign Affairs Minister of Spain Josep Piqué in 2001, there&#8217;s obviously been numerous changes that have affected transatlantic relations and relations between Spain and the U.S.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And that is, dear Mr. President, why I&#8217;m so happy to announce this new joint declaration between the U.S. and Spain, which will help to strengthen the relations between Spain and the U.S.</p>



<p>In this declaration, we are doing a lot of different things.&nbsp; First of all, we are reinforcing our support for a rules-based international order.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s very important to say that today here in Madrid as a consequence of the holding of the NATO Summit here because Putin&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine is a clear violation of international law, a direct attack on our shared values, and it demonstrates the need to redouble our efforts to support that rules-based international order.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And one of the main consequences of Putin’s war has actually been the revitalization of the transatlantic Alliance.&nbsp; When Europe&#8217;s security was at stake, what every Ally has done, including Spain, has been to respond decisively, reinforcing our eastern flank while recognizing the threats that come from the southern flank and, therefore, the importance for the Alliance to develop everything that&#8217;s been called the “Alliance 360 strategy.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>And Spain has practically, dear Mr. President, doubled its military presence in Latvia with the recent deployment this very week of an anti-air defense system in the Lielvarde Air Force Base.&nbsp; The Spanish contingent in Latvia is now 592.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And we&#8217;re also taking part in the Baltic air police patrols.&nbsp; Our Navy ships are maintaining their presence in the Alliance’s permanent forces.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so, in total, Spain is participating with its deployments in five NATO missions with a total of 1,471 forces deployed.</p>



<p>And in this context in which we&#8217;re dealing, I think, with the biggest challenge to peace in Europe since the end of the Cold War, today the U.S. and Spain have committed to strengthen our cooperation in the areas of defense and security. </p>



<p>Specifically, we have spoken about the U.S.’s interest in increasing its presence in Rota’s Navy Base in order to strengthen the Alliance&#8217;s collective security. </p>



<p>And on the other hand, and as is set down in the joint declaration, we have agreed to strengthen the bonds between us in the areas of justice, cybersecurity, energy security &#8212; and, by the way, I&#8217;m very grateful to the U.S. government and the whole of the U.S. for all that LPG that we are receiving in Spain &#8212; and also the management of immigration flows, everything that has to do with climate change, technology, and digital transformation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, in this update of this joint declaration that was signed back in 2001, we are expanding and reinforcing our bilateral relations.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re also, of course, aware of the importance of the trade relations between our economies.&nbsp; And in our respective national recovery plans, we see an excellent opportunity for U.S. companies in Spain and Spanish companies in the U.S.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And in that context, I would like to thank President Biden for his role in redefining the transatlantic trade relations, which, over the last year, have been able to resolve past differences and embark on a much more positive track &#8212; forgetting that past and looking towards the future with hope.</p>



<p>We also agree on the importance of promoting a positive agenda in Latin America, a region which &#8212; in the most part, a region with shared values.&nbsp; And together, we will be able to better defend a rules-based international order.</p>



<p>Together, we&#8217;ve also discussed the increasing challenges of a very important region for Spain and Europe, which is the Sahel; also the role of China in the current geopolitical context, which will be discussed in the NATO Summit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, we will continue to work together in multilateral fora, like the U.N. and the G20, in order to promote a coordinated response to all the global challenges we have, including climate emergency, food security, or the architecture of global health after the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>



<p>So, overall, this visit, dear Mr. President, has been a significant turning point in the bilateral relations between our two countries.</p>



<p>(Speaks English.)&nbsp; Allow me to finish by thanking you for your leadership.&nbsp; We are pleased to have the U.S. back on the side of multilateralism.&nbsp; The Madrid NATO Summit will start tomorrow and the decisions that we will take will reinforce our transatlantic bond.&nbsp; You can count on Spain as a solid ally and friend.</p>



<p>Thank you very much, Mr. President.</p>



<p>PRESIDENT BIDEN:&nbsp; Well, thank you, Pedro.&nbsp; You can count on us as well.&nbsp; And, you know, thank you for welcoming me today here and for hosting the NATO Summit in Madrid.&nbsp; And we have a &#8212; we had a very warm and personal discussion upstairs.&nbsp; And one of the things I look forward to is having an hour together before we begin the whole conference.</p>



<p>You know, we&#8217;re marking 40 years &#8212; 40 years since Spain joined NATO in becoming an indispensable Ally.&nbsp; And today, we&#8217;re standing together to defend our shared security &#8212; and I emphasize shared security; strengthen our transatlantic alliance; and meet the challenge we face today and in the future.&nbsp; That&#8217;s one of the things we&#8217;re going to be talking about in this meeting this week.</p>



<p>And as President Sánchez and I want to talk to you &#8212; thank you for Spain&#8217;s hospitality for U.S. service members and their families stationed here in Spain.</p>



<p>Mr. President, you&#8217;re hosting a truly historic summit and the key moment in our Alliance when Russia&#8217;s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine was &#8212; shattered peace in Europe and shattered every norm since World War Two that’s has been in place.&nbsp; And I want to thank you personally &#8212; you &#8212; for your leadership.</p>



<p>Transatlantic unity has been and will continue to be the greatest strength in our response to Russia &#8212; transatlantic security.&nbsp; We&#8217;re standing as one to support Ukraine and to enhance our own deterrence and defense capabilities.</p>



<p>And as I said before the war started: If Putin attacked Ukraine, United States would enhance our force posture Europe and respond to the reality of a new European security environment.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, we &#8212; we surged additional U.S. forces to Europe to bolster our Alliance in response to Russia&#8217;s aggressive actions.&nbsp; And for months, we&#8217;ve been consulting closely on additional steps the United States will take alongside our Allies, who are also stepping up and strengthening our selective and collective security.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Together, the new commitments will constitute an impressive display of Allied unity and resolve and NATO&#8217;s 360-degree approach to our security.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to discussing all of this during the summit.&nbsp; But, Mr. President, you and I discussed today: We&#8217;re going to work on an agreement to increase the number of U.S. naval destroyers stationed at Spain&#8217;s Rota Naval Base, which will also enhance the bilateral defensive relationship between Spain and the United States.&nbsp; We expect that to occur much sooner than later.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I welcome the steps that Spain has taken in solidarity with our Allies that we’re facing heightened threats on their borders, including sending additional capabilities you referenced to Latvia.&nbsp; Thank you, Mr. President.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I&#8217;ll be laying out additional steps the United States is going to take with our NATO colleagues as our &#8212; in our summit tomorrow.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the bottom line is this: Together, the Alliance is threatening [sic] its posture &#8212; is dealing with the threats and strengthening our posture against the threats from the east and challenges from the south.  NATO is focused on all directions and domains: land, air, and sea. </p>



<p>And, Mr. President, we also discussed how the United States and Spain and other Allies are keeping needed weapons and equipment flowing to Ukraine so they &#8212; they&#8217;re &#8212; they&#8217;re standing up in ways that I don&#8217;t think anyone anticipated, showing enormous bravery, enormous resolve.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re continuing to tighten sanctions on Russia as well.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re providing assistance to the government and the people of Ukraine as they respond to this unprovoked assault on their lives and their democracies.&nbsp; Sometimes, I think Putin&#8217;s objective is just to literally change the entire culture, wipe out the culture of Ukraine &#8212; the kinds of actions he&#8217;s taking.</p>



<p>And I want to particularly thank you, Mr. President, and the people of Spain for the support you&#8217;ve shown in welcoming more than 140,000 Ukrainian citizens refuge here in Spain. That&#8217;s remarkable and a testament to your people.&nbsp; And it’s a testament to the spirit and resolve of not only the Spanish people, but of your leadership and to stand up for what is right at a moment of crisis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our shared democratic values, together with our long history of friendship, make Spain and the United States strong partners on all the issues that we face together.&nbsp; In the Western Hemisphere, Spain and the United States are working together with other countries in the Latin and Caribbean areas to reinforce democratic institutions, strengthen the rule of law, spread economic prosperity, and advanced transformative approaches to manage migration.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We&#8217;re looking to do more together in Africa as well to promote stability and economic growth.&nbsp; And we reaffirmed our joint commitment today to continue to work together on the biggest challenges that affect the people all around the world, from COVID-19 to climate change.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And we&#8217;re releasing a Joint Declaration that reaffirms our shared values, reflects the full breadth of our cooperation.&nbsp; And we have asked our teams to follow up on the substance of the Joint Declaration so they become known to everyone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so, thank you, again, Pedro, for your friendship and your close partnership.&nbsp; And we had a good discussion today, and I&#8217;m looking forward to continue good discussions for the remainder of this conference.&nbsp; But thank you for your hospitality.&nbsp;</p>
