<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>The United States is rallying the world’s democracies to deliver for our people, meet the world’s biggest challenges, and demonstrate our shared values</em></p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">Today, President Biden will meet with G7 leaders to discuss ways to forge a more fair, sustainable, and inclusive global economy that meets the unique challenges of our time. President Biden and G7 partners are committed to a global recovery that benefits the middle class and working families at home and around the world.</p>



<p>President Biden and G7 leaders agreed to continue providing policy support to the global economy for as long as necessary to create a strong, balanced, and inclusive economic recovery.&nbsp; In addition, leaders are expected to announce that the G7 is:</p>



<p><strong>Rallying around the US proposal for Strong Global Minimum Tax.  </strong>G7 leaders will endorse a strong global minimum tax of at least 15 percent. This U.S. priority is a critical step towards ending the decades-long race to the bottom that pushes nations to compete over who can offer the lowest tax rate to large corporations at the expense of protecting workers, investing in infrastructure, and growing the middle class.</p>



<p>This unprecedented progress reflects the Biden Administration’s commitment to building a global tax system that is equitable and equipped to meet the needs of the 21st century global economy. By making big multinational corporations pay their fair share and raising resources to fund priorities for domestic renewal – such as infrastructure, childcare, affordable housing, and education – a global corporate minimum tax is a key part of our efforts to deliver a foreign policy for the middle class, and will help support working families everywhere.&nbsp; This agreement is a clear illustration of how American leadership and commitment to multilateralism can produce results for American workers and businesses.<br><br>Today’s agreement paves the way for the removal of Digital Service Taxes (DSTs) and other discriminatory taxes. In addition to agreement on a global minimum tax, the G7 also reached historic agreement on a plan to replace DSTs with a broader reallocation of taxing rights to the places where the largest and most profitable multinational corporations are doing business and making money. Importantly, this applies to large multinationals broadly, both domestic and foreign, and not just the technology sector. This is an important principle for the United States, and will ensure that big multinational companies across the economy will pay a little more in the places where they operate, whether or not they have their headquarters there.<br><br><strong>Exploring a Major Reallocation of Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) to Countries in Need:&nbsp; </strong>The United States and our G7 partners are actively considering a global effort to multiply the impact of the International Monetary Fund’s proposed&nbsp; Special Drawing Rights (SDR) allocation to the countries most in need.&nbsp; At potentially up to $100 billion in size, the proposed effort would further support health needs &#8211; including vaccinations &#8211; and help enable greener, more robust economic recoveries in vulnerable countries, and promote a more balanced, sustained, and inclusive global recovery.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>More detail will be included in the G7 Leaders’ Communique.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>12:54 P.M. BST<br> <br>MODERATOR: And so, again, in the interest of time, we&#8217;re going to move on to this next section. <br> <br>I am now going to pass it back to [senior administration official], again, joined by [senior administration official], to preview the G7 Summit, as well as the economic deliverables to come out of that. <br> <br>A reminder that this section, unlike the other two, is embargoed until tomorrow morning, June 11th, 7:00 a.m. British Summer Time. <br> <br>So, [senior administration officials], we&#8217;ll pass it back to you.<br> <br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:   Thanks.  I&#8217;ll start and just point out, you know, this is the first G7 Summit in nearly two years.  It&#8217;s the first G7 Summit that President Biden is attending.  It is the first G7 Summit that has been held since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.  And we think it is an incredibly important moment for the G7 for all the reasons I was just describing. <br> <br>As the President has said many times, we are entering a period in which the question has been called between democracies and autocracies.  And pulling together the G7, plus our partner countries, we believe would demonstrate that we&#8217;re unified in our resolve to show that democracy and shared democratic values provide the single best path for delivering results for our people and for meeting the biggest challenges of the world. <br> <br>And I want to just reinforce that last point.  Top to bottom, the driving, animating purpose of this G7 Summit is to show that democracies can deliver against the biggest challenges we are facing in the world. <br> <br>So, on the global economy, the G7 will be spending its time here talking about how it can most effectively contribute to the global economic recovery and to global economic fairness, including through things like committing to this global minimum tax.<br> <br>On COVID-19, as we&#8217;ve already talked about, not only will there be a significant commitment of doses, but an embrace of a broader roadmap to help end the pandemic.<br> <br>On climate, we will have more to say over the next couple of days, but the G7 countries will not only recommit to what they&#8217;ve laid out at the President&#8217;s Leaders Summit on Climate, as well as their own national contributions, but there will be tangible action proposed and adopted at this G7, on climate. <br> <br>And then, in terms of infrastructure and the enormous need for low- and middle-income countries around the world to have their infrastructure requirements met, the G7+ will embrace a high-standards, transparent, climate-friendly, non-corrupt mechanism for investing in the physical, digital, and health infrastructure of low- and middle-income countries.  It will be an alternative to that which other countries, including China, are offering. <br> <br>And then, of course, there will be discussion of all of the hotspots and the key regional challenges, as well as the way in which new technologies are reshaping our world.  So they will discuss ransomware and how to set the rules of the road on all forms of emerging technology so that it’s democracies, and not autocracies, who are laying the foundation for standards as we go forward.<br> <br>All of this will end up getting enshrined in the G7 leaders communiqué that will be released at the conclusion of the summit.  There will be a few other leader-level documents as well, but that&#8217;s the broad basis of what we&#8217;re trying to accomplish: meaningful outcomes on COVID, on climate, on the global economy, on infrastructure, on ransomware, and cyber. <br> <br>And when you add it all up, I think a fair read of what will come out of these next few days is one of the most substantive, if not the most substantive, set of deliverables out of the G7 in long memory.  It&#8217;s &#8212; there&#8217;s going to be a lot packed into these three days and a number of significant, concrete outcomes.<br> <br>So, with that, let me turn it over to [senior administration official].<br> <br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yeah, thanks, [senior administration official].  So I&#8217;ll talk about the first working session of the G7, which is going to be tomorrow.  And it&#8217;s going to focus on the global economy. <br> <br>So, let me give some context, which is that the U.S. is once again leading the world economy into recovery from a position of strength at home. <br> <br>And as you know, this is a dramatic turnaround from when the President took office four months ago.  U.S. economic growth projections for this year have doubled since December; they&#8217;re projected to be the fastest in almost 40 years. <br> <br>The labor market is clearly gathering strength.  The economy has added over 540,000 jobs on average since the President took office, the most over four months of any presidency. <br> <br>Unemployment has fallen from above 14 percent to under 6 percent, and it&#8217;s expected to return to pre-pandemic levels by 2023, which is about seven years faster than compared to the post-2009 recovery.  Actually, if you look at the latest jobs report, it showed the largest one-month drop in long-term unemployment in a decade. <br> <br>And for context, long-term unemployment is especially pernicious to the labor force.  The longer one is unemployed, the more difficult, historically, it&#8217;s been to find new employment. <br> <br>So, you know, that&#8217;s the context.  And importantly, as we head into these G7 meetings, the strength of the U.S. economy is helping to power the global economic recovery.  Both the OECD and the IMF estimate that U.S. economic growth this year will add a percentage point to global growth.  And this is coming after 2020 &#8212; a year in which global growth contracted 3.5 percent, which is the worst peacetime recession since the Great Depression. <br> <br>So these economic outcomes, as [senior administration officials] both alluded to, they&#8217;re the result of deliberate choices: the wartime, whole-of-government effort that [senior administration official] described to beat back the pandemic, but also the bold and unflinching decision the President made to go big and upfront on fiscal support and the plans to make generational investments to address structural challenges and lift the economy&#8217;s growth potential by addressing longstanding disparities and by boosting the innovation and dynamism of the economy. <br> <br>So, here at the G7, we&#8217;ll continue to make efforts to accelerate the global growth recovery, which, in turn, will create long-term benefits to U.S. exports and U.S. jobs. <br> <br>So we&#8217;ll do that in three ways.  We&#8217;ll &#8212; leaders will encourage G7 partners to continue providing near-term fiscal support to create a balanced global recovery, as well as long-term structural investments to boost our innovation and dynamism together. <br> <br>We will also build on the commitment from finance ministers, last week, to give active consideration to channel a proportion of the IMF&#8217;s plans to allocate $650 billion in economic support through Special Drawing Rights to multiply the impact of that allocation to lower-income countries where the pandemic response needs are the greatest and where the economic recovery has been slowest. <br> <br>And the last thing I&#8217;ll mention before we can take questions is: Leaders will also endorse the historic agreement reached last week by finance ministers for a global minimum corporate tax of at least 15 percent.  It&#8217;s a major statement to have G7 unity on this effort.  It will serve as a springboard to getting broader agreement at the G20.  So we see this as a critical step towards ending the race to the bottom on corporate taxes that&#8217;s come at the expense of workers, at the expense of investments in domestic renewal, and at the expense of growing the middle class.<br> <br>I&#8217;ll stop there.<br> <br>MODERATOR:  Thanks so much.  So, we have time for a couple of questions.  So, if you&#8217;ve got a question on this recent G7 section or the economic deliverables, please use the “raise hand” function.<br> <br>Okay, no questions.  As a reminder that this most recent section &#8212; oh, coming in at the last second.  Well, why don&#8217;t we start with Andrew Restuccia with the Wall Street Journal.<br> <br>Q    Thanks.  I wanted to ask [senior administration official] about the Johnson meeting just because we only got one question on that.  Can you talk a little bit about Northern Ireland specifically and what the President might tell the Prime Minister on that subject?  And I would love for you to respond to this report in the Times of the UK, as well, if you could.  Thanks.<br> <br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  All right, sure.  On Northern Ireland, the President is going to say to the Prime Minister what he has said publicly for a long time now, including as recently as St. Patrick&#8217;s Day, which is that he believes that the Good Friday Agreement is the foundation for peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland; that a lot of progress has been made over the 20-plus years since the Good Friday Agreement came into force and that that progress must be protected; and that the outcome of the current discussions between the UK and the EU should ensure the continued vitality of the Good Friday Agreement.<br> <br>You know, the United States is not in those negotiations and not seeking to be in those negotiations.  And we are instead a strong and vigorous supporter of practical, creative, flexible, results-oriented negotiations that, at the end of the day, produce a result that protects all of the gains that the people of Northern Ireland &#8212; that all communities in Northern Ireland have made.  And that&#8217;s what he&#8217;s going to say.<br> <br>It will not be confrontational or adversarial or &#8212; you know, he didn&#8217;t come here to give a lecture.  He came merely to communicate what he believes very, very deeply about peace in Northern Ireland, about the priority the United States places on that, about the priority Joe Biden places on that.  And that&#8217;s the spirit with which he&#8217;ll approach the conversation.<br> <br>MODERATOR:  Thank you.  And so, in the interest of time, we&#8217;re going to have to conclude.  Thanks so much for everyone joining.<br> <br>As a friendly reminder, again, this most recent section on the G7 preview and economic deliverables is embargoed until tomorrow, June 11th, 7:00 a.m. British Summer Time.  And the other two sections on the COVID-19 vaccine announcement, as well as the preview of the President&#8217;s bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Johnson are embargoed until this call concludes, which will be momentarily.<br> <br>Thank you again for all your time.  And we&#8217;ll be in touch very soon.<br> <br>12:57 P.M. BST</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Tregenna Castle Resort<br>Cornwall, United Kingdom</p>



<p>6:28 P.M. BST<br><br>PRESIDENT BIDEN:&nbsp; Good evening, everyone.&nbsp; First, I want to express our condolences on behalf of Jill and I to Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II, the entire Royal Family, and the people of the United Kingdom.&nbsp; Today would have been Prince Philip’s 100th birthday, and I know there are a lot of people feeling his absence today.&nbsp;<br><br>In addition, I&#8217;d like to point out that the &#8212; the greet from the British government has been exemplary.&nbsp; We’ve had a good first full day here in the UK.&nbsp; Prime Minister Johnson and I had a very productive meeting.&nbsp; We discharged and discussed a broad range of issues on which the United Kingdom and the United States are working in very close cooperation.<br><br>We affirmed the Special Relationship &#8212; and it&#8217;s not said lightly &#8212; the Special Relationship between our people, and we renewed our commitment to defending the enduring democratic values that both our nations share &#8212; (clears throat) &#8212; that are the strong &#8212; excuse me &#8212; the strong foundation of our partnership.<br><br>Eighty years ago, Prime Minister Winston Churchill and President Franklin Roosevelt signed an agreement known as the Atlantic Charter.&nbsp; It was a statement of first principles &#8212; a promise that the United Kingdom and the United States would meet the challenges of their age and they would meet it together.<br><br>Today, we’ve built on that commitment with a revitalized Atlantic Charter updated to reaffirm that promise while speaking directly to the key challenges of this century: cybersecurity, emerging technologies, global health, and climate change.<br><br>We discussed our common goals for driving ambitious global action to address the climate crisis.&nbsp; The Climate Leaders Summit that I hosted in April was, in part, about helping drive forward the momentum toward the critical COP 26 that the UK will host in Glasgow later this year.<br><br>We talked about the shared sacrifices our service members have made, bravely serving side by side in Afghanistan for close to 20 years.&nbsp; The UK was with us from the start, as they always are, equally committed to rooting out the terrorist threat, and now we&#8217;re coordinating our withdrawal together.<br><br>And, of course, we talked about how our two nations can, together, lead the global fight against COVID-19.&nbsp; That’s been a major focus of the G7 under British leadership, particularly in focusing and coordinating our resources to help vaccinate the world.<br><br>And tonight, I&#8217;m making a historic announcement regarding America’s leadership in the fight against COVID-19.&nbsp; America knows firsthand the tragedies of this pandemic.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve had &#8212; we&#8217;ve had more people die in the United States than anywhere in the world: nearly 600,000 of our fellow Americans &#8212; moms, dads, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters, grandparents.&nbsp; More deaths from COVID-19 in the United States than from World War One, World War Two, the Vietnam War, and 9/11 combined &#8212; combined.&nbsp; We know the tragedy.<br><br>But we also know the path to recovery.&nbsp; The United States has now vaccinated 64 percent of our adults with at least one shot.&nbsp; Just four and half months ago, we were at only 5 percent with one shot.<br><br>It took a herculean effort on the part of our government to manage one of the biggest and, I would say, most complicated logistical challenges in our history.&nbsp; It took the ingenuity of scientists, building on decades of research, to develop a vaccine.&nbsp; It took the full capacity of American companies manufacturing and delivering the vaccines around the clock.<br><br>And as a result, we have the lowest number of daily deaths since the first day of this pandemic.&nbsp; Our economy is rebounding.&nbsp; Our vaccination program has already saved tens of thousands of lives, with that count growing each day.&nbsp; And it has allowed millions &#8212; millions of Americans to get back to living their lives.<br><br>And from the beginning of my presidency, we have been clear-eyed that we need to attack this virus globally as well.&nbsp; This is about our responsibility &#8212; our humanitarian obligation to save as many lives as we can &#8212; and our responsibility to our values.<br><br>We value the inherent dignity of all people.&nbsp; In times of trouble, Americans reach out to offer help and to offer a helping hand.&nbsp; That’s who we are.<br><br>And when we see people hurting and suffering anywhere around the world, we seek to help as best we can.&nbsp; That’s why,&nbsp;under both Republican and Democratic Presidents, the United States has made transformative commitments to bolster global health &#8212; commitments under President Bush, like PEPFAR, which changed the global fight against HIV/AIDS.&nbsp; And in this moment, our values call on us to do everything that we can to vaccinate the world against COVID-19.<br><br>It&#8217;s also in America’s self-interest.&nbsp; As long as the virus rages elsewhere, there is a risk of new mutations that could threaten our people.&nbsp;<br><br>We know that raging COVID-19 in other countries holds back global growth, raises instability, and weakens governments.&nbsp; And as we’ve seen in the United States, with the evidence clearer day by the day, the key to reopening and growing economies is to vaccinate your people.&nbsp;<br><br>Our vaccination program has helped the American economy begin to recover from the worst economic crisis in a century.&nbsp; Over 2 million new jobs created just in the last four months since I&#8217;ve become President.&nbsp; A historic decline in long-term unemployment.&nbsp; Businesses reopening and a projected economic growth of nine point &#8212; excuse me, 6.9 percent &#8212; the fastest in nearly four decades in America.<br><br>Just as the American economy is recovering, it is in all of our interests to have the global economy begin to recover as well.&nbsp; And that won’t happen unless we can get the pandemic under control worldwide.<br><br>That&#8217;s why, as I said in my address to the joint session of Congress in April, America will be the arsenal of vaccines in our fight against COVID- &#8212; COVID-19, just as America was the arsenal of democracy during World War Two.<br><br>Over the past four months, we have taken a number of steps toward this historic effort.&nbsp; We have contributed more than any nation to COVAX &#8212; a collective global effort that is delivering COVID-19 vaccines across the world.<br><br>We have supported manufacturing efforts abroad through our partnerships with Japan, India, and Australia &#8212; known as the &#8220;Quad.&#8221;&nbsp; We&#8217;ve shared doses with our neighbors Canada and Mexico.<br><br>And in addition, three weeks ago, with America’s vaccines &#8212; America&#8217;s vaccine supply secured and with confidence we have enough vaccines to cover every American who wants one, we announced that we would donate 80 million doses of our own vaccine &#8212; in house now &#8212; to supply the world by the end of June.&nbsp; Many of these doses are shipping to countries around the world as we speak.<br><br>And today, we&#8217;re taking a major step that will supercharge the global fight against this pandemic.&nbsp; At my direction, the United States will purchase an additional half billion doses from Pfizer &#8212; the Pfizer vaccine &#8212; that we&#8217;ll donate nearly 100 low- and lower-middle-income countries.&nbsp;&nbsp; They will be the beneficiaries.&nbsp;<br><br>Let me say that again: The United States will purchase a half a billion doses of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine to donate to nearly 100 nations that are in dire need in the fight against this pandemic.&nbsp; That&#8217;s a historic step.&nbsp; The largest single purchase and donation of COVID-19 vaccines by any single country ever.<br><br>Importantly, this is an mRNA vaccine, which is proven to be extremely effective against COVID-19 and every known variant of that virus thus far.<br><br>These half a billion vaccines will start to be shipped in August as quickly as they roll off the manufacturing line.&nbsp; Two hundred million of these doses will be delivered this year, in 2021, and 300 million more will be delivered in the first half of 2022.<br><br>Let me be clear: Just as with the 80 million doses&nbsp;we previously announced, the United States is providing these half million [billion] doses with no strings attached.&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me say it again: with no strings attached.<br><br>Our vaccine donations don’t include pressure for favors or potential conce- &#8212; concessions.&nbsp; We’re doing this to save lives, to end this pandemic.&nbsp; That&#8217;s it.&nbsp; Period.&nbsp;<br><br>I also want thank Albert Bourla, Pfizer’s CEO and Chairman, for joining me today.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve gotten to know each other over the last few months.&nbsp; He and I and his entire team have really &#8212; he&#8217;s really stepped up at this critical stage in our fight against the pandemic.<br><br>And the plan is for a half a billion doses that we&#8217;ll be sending around the world to be produced in the United States,<br>including at Pfizer’s manufacturing plant in Kalamazoo, Michigan.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Eighty years ago, not too far from that plant in Kalamazoo in the Detroit area, American workers built tanks and planes and vehicles that helped defeat the global threat of fascism in World War Two.&nbsp; They built what became known as the “arsenal of democracy.”<br><br>Now, a new generation of American men and women, working with the day&#8217;s &#8212; working with today’s latest technology, is going to build a new arsenal to defeat the current enemy of world peace, health, and stability: COVID-19.&nbsp;<br><br>Albert was gracious enough to welcome me to Kalamazoo plant back in February.&nbsp; It’s incredible the ingenuity, the care, the safety that goes into every single dose as I toured the entire plant.&nbsp;<br><br>Most of all, when you&#8217;re there, you feel the pride every worker there feels, how &#8212; the pride they feel in what they are doing.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve been to a lot of plants.&nbsp; I have worked &#8212; I&#8217;m a big union guy.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve been doing it my whole career.&nbsp; But you could see the looks on their faces; they were proud.&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean it sincerely, they were proud of what they were doing.&nbsp; They knew what they were doing.&nbsp;<br><br>American workers will now produce vaccines to save lives of people in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean.&nbsp; People they will never meet and have never met in places they&#8217;ve never visited and probably won&#8217;t have an opportunity to, but lives saved all the same thanks to American leadership and American workers&#8217; hard work and values.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Let me close with this: This is a monumental commitment by the American people.&nbsp; As I said, we&#8217;re a nation full of people who step up at times of need to help our fellow human beings, both at home and abroad.&nbsp; We&#8217;re not perfect, but we step up.&nbsp;<br><br>But we&#8217;re not alone in this endeavor, that&#8217;s the point I want to make.&nbsp; We&#8217;re going to help lead the world out of this pandemic, working alongside our global partners.<br><br>Under the UK chairmanship of the G7, democracies of the world are posed to deliver as well.&nbsp; This U.S. contribution<br>is the foundation for additional coordinated efforts to help vaccine the world &#8212; vaccinate the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>The British government, the Prime Minister has led a strong campaign to get people vaccinated across the UK, and I’m grateful they&#8217;re making their own generous donation.<br><br>Tomorrow, the G7 nations will be announcing the full scope of our commitment &#8212; &#8220;our,&#8221; meaning the G7.&nbsp; And I want to thank all of my G7 partners for stepping up to recognize our responsibility to meet the moment.&nbsp; I’m looking forward to working with my counterparts on these efforts in the coming days and much more.<br><br>One final point I want to make clear: This is not the end of our efforts to fight COVID-19 or vaccinate the world.&nbsp; We have to turn manufacturing &#8212; we have to turn manufactured doses into shots in arms to protect people and communities.<br><br>That’s why the United States is already providing hundreds of millions in funding to support last-minute vaccination efforts, including new funding from Congress as part of the American Rescue Plan and working with programs in Latin America, Asia, and Africa.<br><br>We’re going to keep manufacturing doses, donating doses, getting “jabs” &#8212; as they say here in the UK &#8212; in arms, until the world has beaten this virus.&nbsp;<br><br>I want to thank you all.&nbsp; Now, I&#8217;d like to turn it over to my friend, the CEO and Chairman of Pfizer, Aver- &#8212; Al- &#8212; Albert Bourla. &nbsp;<br><br>Albert, it&#8217;s all yours.&nbsp; And, again, personally, thank you for stepping up.&nbsp;<br><br>MR. BOURLA:&nbsp; Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Thank you.<br><br>MR. BOURLA:&nbsp; Thank you very much.&nbsp;<br><br>Thank you, Mr. President.&nbsp; And it is, of course, a great honor to be with you today for this historic announcement.<br><br>As the G7 countries come together for this critical summit, the eyes of the world are on the leaders of these powerful nations to help solve the ongoing COVID-19 crisis.&nbsp; While great progress has been made in many developed nations, the world is now asking the G7 leaders to shoulder the responsibility to help vaccinate people in all countries.<br><br>Mr. President, I know from our conversations that we agree that every man, woman, and child on the planet, regardless of financial condition, race, religion, or geography deserve access to lifesaving COVID-19 vaccines.&nbsp;<br><br>And once again, the United States has answered the call, and we are grateful to you and your administration for your leadership in this front.<br><br>Today, we are providing 500 million doses of the Pfizer–BioNTech vaccine to the world&#8217;s poorest nations.&nbsp; This will significantly enhance our ability to meet our goal of providing 2 billion doses of the vaccine to low- and middle-income countries over the next 18 months.<br><br>Thanks to the ingenuity of so many scientists and the dedication of so many manufacturing workers, today we can see clearly the light at the end of the tunnel.&nbsp; But we still have work to do.&nbsp; And I can assure you, Mr. President, that we will be relentless in pursuing more services to end the pandemic.<br><br>Just this week, we began dosing participants aged 5 to 11 years old in a global Phase 2/3 study.&nbsp; In this respect, we continue our studies in pregnant women.<br><br>We are also closely monitoring and addressing the emerging variants, we are testing our vaccine&#8217;s response to newly arising variants, and we are coordinating with public health authorities around the world on surveillance efforts.<br><br>So far, data saw that none of the existing variant strains has escaped the protection provided by our vaccine.&nbsp; I repeat: none.&nbsp; Not one.<br><br>Still, we have built a process to develop, within 100 days, a new vaccine if needed.&nbsp; God forbid.<br><br>Our scientists are also pursuing an oral treatment against COVID-19.&nbsp; Initial indications are promising.&nbsp; And if things goes well, we could apply for approval before the end of this year.<br><br>But I wanted to finish my &#8212; by coming back to the importance of your announcement today, Mr. President.&nbsp; In a pandemic, everyone is only as protected as their neighbors &#8212; their neighbors down the street, as well as their global neighbors around the world.<br><br>Today&#8217;s announcement with the U.S. government gets us closer to our goal and significantly enhances our ability to save even more lives across the globe.<br><br>Mr. President, I want to thank you for your leadership, vision, and partnership.&nbsp; We look forward to continue to work with your administration to ensure that science wins the battle against COVID-19.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>PRESIDENT BIDEN:&nbsp; Thank you.<br><br>MR. BOURLA:&nbsp; Thank you.<br><br>PRESIDENT BIDEN:&nbsp; Thank you all.<br><br>6:46 P.M. BST</p>

<p>Today, the President of the United States and Prime Minister of the United Kingdom reaffirm their commitment to work together to realise our vision for a more peaceful and prosperous future.<br><br>Our revitalised Atlantic Charter, building on the commitments and aspirations set out eighty years ago, affirms our ongoing commitment to sustaining our enduring values and defending them against new and old challenges.&nbsp;We commit to working closely with all partners who share our democratic values and to countering the efforts of those who seek to undermine our alliances and institutions.<br><br><strong>First</strong>, we resolve to defend the principles, values, and institutions of democracy and open societies, which drive our own national strength and our alliances.&nbsp;We must ensure that democracies – starting with our own –&nbsp;can deliver on solving the critical challenges of our time.&nbsp;We will champion transparency, uphold the rule of law, and support civil society and independent media.&nbsp;We will also confront injustice and inequality and defend the inherent dignity and human rights of all individuals.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Second</strong>, we intend to strengthen the institutions, laws, and norms that sustain international co-operation to adapt them to meet the new challenges of the 21<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;century, and guard against those that would undermine them.&nbsp;We will work through the rules-based international order to tackle global challenges together;&nbsp;embrace the promise and manage the peril of emerging technologies; promote economic advancement and the dignity of work; and enable open and fair trade between nations.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Third</strong>, we remain united behind the principles of sovereignty, territorial integrity, and the peaceful resolution of disputes.

<p>As President Biden travels overseas to engage with global counterparts, recent economic data reinforce that U.S. fiscal policy and vaccination progress are positioning the economy for growth and job creation. Today we learned that, since January, the four-week moving average for state unemployment insurance claims have fallen by more than 50% &#8212; from more than 834,000 to 402,500. That’s the lowest level since the pandemic began. &nbsp;This news comes as independent analysts project that economic growth in the United States will outpace growth for our peer nations and reach the fastest pace in nearly four decades.&nbsp; Earlier this week, the World Bank increased their projection for U.S. economic growth this year by 3.3% to 6.8%. The 3.3% upward revision in the United States compares to a 2.1% revision in other advanced economies. &nbsp;Another analysis last week found that the United States is the only major industrialized nation to have its growth projection through 2025 revised upward. These data underscore the leading role the U.S. is playing in building towards a global recovery.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>Today, President Biden visited the U.K. at the invitation of the Prime Minister and in advance of the G7 Summit. The President and the Prime Minister set out a global vision in a new Atlantic Charter to deepen cooperation in democracy and human rights, defence and security, science and innovation, and economic prosperity, with renewed joint efforts to tackle the challenges posed by climate change, biodiversity loss, and emerging health threats.</p>



<p><strong>DEMOCRACY, HUMAN RIGHTS, &amp; MULTILATERALISM</strong></p>



<ol><li>Building on the U.K. G7 Presidency’s focus on open societies, and looking ahead to the U.S.-hosted Summit for Democracy, the U.S. and U.K. will continue to make practical efforts to support open societies and democracy across the globe.&nbsp;We will do this by defending media freedom, advancing a free and open internet, combatting corruption, tackling disinformation, protecting civic space, advancing women’s political empowerment, protecting freedom of religion or belief, and promoting human rights of all people.&nbsp; The United Nations remains the cornerstone of the international system, and its foundational principles reflect our shared values.&nbsp; In the 75 years since the UN’s creation, international security has been increasingly challenged by threats that do not recognise borders: climate change, pandemics, famine, migration, organised crime, and terrorism. The U.K. and U.S. will work with the UN and our international partners to continue to adapt and reform the international system to tackle these evolving threats and to build back better for the 21st century, while remaining true to the universal founding principles of the UN and the core values of its Charter. We commit to promoting peaceful and inclusive societies to reduce injustice, inequality, poverty, and hunger worldwide. We carry responsibility for creating sustainable and viable conditions to global economic challenges through our commitment to the G7 Agenda and 2030 Agenda on Sustainable Development, and we will work together to address pre-existing inequities and inequalities being exacerbated by COVID-19, ensuring they no longer go unaddressed.&nbsp;The U.S. and U.K. are committed to promoting the advancement of gender&nbsp;equity and&nbsp;equality as a key pillar of foreign policy and national security, including through educating girls, empowering women socially, economically, and politically, and ending violence against women and girls.&nbsp;</li></ol>



<p><strong>DEFENCE &amp; SECURITY</strong></p>



<ol start="2"><li>We commit&nbsp;to enhance further the world’s strongest bilateral defence, security, and intelligence partnership to overcome the evolving threats of the twenty-first century. This includes&nbsp;threats and challenges associated with: cyberspace, foreign interference, harmful influence campaigns, illicit finance, violent conflict and extremism, and terrorism in all its forms. To this end, we will continue our partnership on those challenges, including working together closely on cyber security, countering&nbsp;illicit finance, and tackling all forms of terrorism by working&nbsp;together&nbsp;to address it online&nbsp;and enhance international collaboration on thwarting violent extremism that is racially, ethnically or ideologically motivated, including a range of hateful and white supremacist ideologies.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Through strong and principled leadership we will work to shape and secure the international order of the future with NATO as the bedrock of our collective defence.&nbsp;We will work together to further strengthen and modernise NATO, and increase its common funding, so the Alliance can harness the full range of military and non-military capabilities to contest existing and new threats, including malicious cyber activity and attacks that test the resiliency of our societies.&nbsp;We intend to take operational measures to modernise and integrate our armed forces, and strengthen bilateral cooperation on next generation capabilities. Last month, the U.K.’s new aircraft carrier, HMS QUEEN ELIZABETH, sailed on her first operational mission with U.S. and U.K. F-35 aircraft on board – a demonstration of the unique interoperability of our Armed Forces.&nbsp;&nbsp;As we maintain close alignment on our nuclear deterrence and modernisation programs, we reaffirm our commitment to effective arms control and nuclear security, and to the goal of a world without nuclear weapons. We will draw on our extensive diplomatic, defence, security, civil and scientific cooperation to ensure Space is a safe and secure environment for all.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li><li>We look forward to bringing into force a robust bilateral data access agreement, to be based on a mutual recognition that both countries have an appropriately high level of data protection, that allows law enforcement investigations on both sides of the Atlantic to obtain the evidence needed to bring offenders to justice, whilst maintaining rigorous privacy standards. We will work together to maintain tightly-controlled lawful access to communications content that is vital to the investigation and prosecution of serious crimes including terrorism and child abuse.&nbsp;And we will work in partnership with technology companies to do this, protecting the safety of our citizens.</li></ol>



<p><strong>SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY</strong></p>



<ol start="5"><li>We will develop a new landmark bilateral technology partnership in 2021/22.&nbsp;It will enable a new era of strategic cooperation to guarantee: the safety and security of our citizens; that we continue to lead the world in R&amp;D; wealth creation and tackling inequality; the values of liberal democracies, open societies and open markets; and that all of these are codified in and threaded throughout the design and use of technology globally We will strengthen cooperation in areas such as: ensuring the diversity, resilience and security of our critical supply chains; enabling our industries and research institutions to develop and apply existing and emerging technologies such as AI, quantum, and battery technologies; and reducing barriers to the accessibility and flow of data to support economic growth, public safety and scientific &amp; technological progress.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>We will continue to strengthen collaboration in science and technology.&nbsp;This will facilitate increased joint world-class research, as well as encourage the development of rules, norms and standards governing data sharing, technology, and the digital economy that reflect our values and principles.&nbsp;We will cooperate on the basis of openness, transparency, and reciprocity, and in hope of ensuring that our collaborative research benefits our people.&nbsp;We will combine our expertise to tackle global challenges, such as cancer, antimicrobial resistance, climate change, and pandemic preparedness. We will do this through closer coordination between the Prime Minister’s Council for Science and Technology and the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, and through closer collaboration between U.S. and U.K. senior science and technology advisers.</li></ol>



<p><strong>TRADE &amp; PROSPERITY</strong></p>



<ol start="7"><li>We commit to deepening and strengthening our vital economic and trading partnership. We commit to the rapid settlement of the Large Civil Aircraft dispute.&nbsp; Both countries recognise that trade, when done right, can support our mutual interest in sustainable and green growth, good jobs for our workers, new opportunities for our innovators and businesses, and high labour and environmental standards.&nbsp; We will therefore work closely to identify and pursue opportunities to deepen our already extensive trade relationship.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li><li>We reaffirm our commitment to spur economic regeneration and build back better in a way that benefits all communities that have experienced the pain of economic change and advances equality for all &#8211; not just in cities, but also small towns and post-industrial areas.&nbsp; Mindful of the distributional consequences of economic policy and that current economic models do not serve all equally in society or adequately tackle issues such as the climate crisis, and recognising the need for equality of opportunity, we intend to launch a new joint initiative that brings together experts, practitioners and officials to advance a new “common sense” about how the economy works and the goals it should promote; the initiative will share best practice and review the evidence around public policies to tackle structural inequalities across the economy and deliver prosperity across society.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>We are proud to welcome G7 leaders’ discussions around&nbsp;a values-driven, high-standard and&nbsp;transparent,&nbsp;infrastructure&nbsp;partnership that seeks to&nbsp;collectively mobilise private-sector capital through catalytic investments &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in low- and middle-income countries from our development finance tools. We look forward to discussing the outline of this new partnership with our G7 partners in Carbis Bay.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>We also welcome the efforts underway through the G20/OECD Inclusive Framework to address the tax challenges arising from globalisation and the digitalisation of the economy and to adopt a global minimum tax. We commit to reaching an equitable solution on the allocation of taxing rights, with market countries awarded taxing rights on at least 20% of profit exceeding a 10% margin for the largest and most profitable multinational enterprises. We will provide for appropriate coordination between the application of the new international tax rules and the removal of all Digital Services Taxes, and other relevant similar measures, on all companies. We also commit to a global minimum tax of at least 15% on a country by country basis. We agree on the importance of progressing agreement in parallel on both Pillars and look forward to reaching an agreement at the July meeting of G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors.</li></ol>



<p><strong>CLIMATE &amp; NATURE</strong></p>



<ol start="11"><li>Together we will work to: rally all countries to strengthen their climate ambitions; achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement; keep within reach the goal of limiting global average temperature rise to no more than 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels; and bend the curve of biodiversity loss by 2030.&nbsp; We will champion the best available science – particularly reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services – and welcome global partnerships, including&nbsp; the COP26 Policy Dialogue on a Transition to Sustainable Agriculture and the Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate to increase and accelerate research and development for innovation in agricultural food systems; and support a resilient transition to decarbonised economies with quality job opportunities; and make progress on climate action in a gender responsive manner.&nbsp; We underscore our commitment to achieving net zero emissions by 2050 at the latest, and call on all other countries to do likewise.&nbsp; We welcome the G7’s creation of an Industrial Decarbonisation Agenda (IDA), which will help drive innovation in, and lower costs of, the decarbonisation of heavy industrial sectors around the world.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li><li>We are committed to achieving an ambitious outcome at COP26 and to the collective developed country goal of mobilising $100 billion annually through to 2025 from a wide variety of public and private sources in the context of meaningful mitigation actions and transparency on implementation.&nbsp; We are both increasing our climate finance from 2020, including for adaptation, and are continuing to pursue additional opportunities to increase climate finance mobilisation.&nbsp; We intend to provide support to countries to enable adaptation, and address the effects of climate impacts, including through finance for nature-based solutions, and by scaling up disaster risk-management, including through the Risk-Informed Early Action Partnership. We are committed to mainstreaming nature across all sectors and into economic decision-making.&nbsp;&nbsp; We also commit to working even more closely together on forests, including through the Forest Agriculture, and Commodity Trade (FACT) Dialogue, the ocean, and finance for nature to conserve, protect and restore natural ecosystems including by championing an ambitious post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Recognising the impact that energy has on our national security, economy, net-zero ambitions, and shared prosperity, we are launching a new ‘Strategic Energy Dialogue’, led by the U.K. Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy and the U.S. Department of Energy. This dialogue aims to deepen our cooperation in areas such as the development and deployment of innovative, clean energy technologies, industrial decarbonisation, nuclear energy, energy security and resilience, joint priorities in multilateral energy forums, and shared science, research, and innovation cooperation.</li></ol>



<p><strong>HEALTH</strong></p>



<ol start="14"><li>We are determined to work together to overcome the current pandemic, which has reversed progress on improving the human condition, and to be better prepared in the future.&nbsp; Reflecting our shared strength in science and technology, we commit to enhancing our cooperation on tackling variants of concern and emerging infectious disease threats with pandemic or epidemic potential. This will be underpinned by collaboration between the new U.K. Health Security Agency (U.K.HSA) Centre for Pandemic Preparedness and the new U.S. National Center for Epidemic Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics.&nbsp; Our collective strength in science will allow us to: scale up surveillance and genomic sequencing capacity, as well as variant assessment capabilities; adopt a One Health approach to account for animal health, and zoonotic and environmental risk; and support others without these capabilities.&nbsp; We welcome the plan to establish an integrated global surveillance system &#8211; the Global Pandemic Radar &#8211; and commit to working with the WHO and other partners to take this forward. Enhancing global surveillance is critical to achieving our collective ambition to deliver safe, effective and affordable vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics within 100 days of a future pandemic threat being identified.&nbsp; We are committed to working together with fellow G7 chief scientists to drive progress toward the bold 100 day ambition and report back to G7 leaders on next steps later this year.&nbsp; We will strengthen collaboration on G7 action on clinical trials for vaccines and therapeutics, through more coordinated research agendas and better sharing of data and results.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li><li>We look forward to normalising two-way travel between our two countries.&nbsp; We will establish a joint U.K.-U.S. Experts’ Working Group, which will share expertise and provide recommendations to leaders on the return of safe and sustainable international travel, demonstrating the commitment of both countries to tackle COVID-19 together.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>We will work together to help increase global vaccine supply through investments in manufacturing of safe and effective vaccines and the materials needed to produce them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will promote the timely availability of vaccines, key components and equipment by encouraging bilateral trade and investment and avoiding export restrictions or other supply chain disruption. We will work together to strengthen multilateral vaccine initiatives, in particular COVAX and its partner organisations CEPI, Gavi, UNICEF and WHO. We will support resource mobilisation for partner financing needs, and work with international financial institutions to build delivery capacity in-country and develop long term, sustainable financing models to increase pandemic preparedness and response and global health security. To this end, the U.K. and U.S. will work together with likeminded countries to explore options for a new sustainable, catalytic health security financing mechanism. We will bring together government and industry to encourage further investment to tackle COVID-19 and prepare for the next health security threat, including by strengthening preparedness and resilience, increasing R&amp;D spending, and tackling new variants. We will continue to help allies and partners accelerate implementation of, and compliance with, the International Health Regulations (IHR). To move towards this goal, we will both strive to promote and advance the Global Health Security Agenda and its bold 2024 target, including through capacity building to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease threats.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>The U.K. and U.S. recognise the central importance of the WHO in global health security. The U.K. and the U.S. will work together and with like-minded Member States to implement the WHO strengthening resolution adopted at the World Health Assembly in May 2021. We will also support a timely, transparent and evidence-based independent process for the next phase of the WHO-convened COVID-19 origins study, including in China, and for investigating outbreaks of unknown origin in the future. We will take account of the recommendations of the International Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response as we work together to learn the lessons from the pandemic and strengthen future preparedness.&nbsp; We commit to advancing critical areas in global health, including strengthening health systems and building regional and country capacity to better withstand future shocks; expanding the availability, accessibility, and quality of essential health services among the world’s most vulnerable, marginalized, and inadequately-served; and prioritizing maternal, neonatal and child health, nutrition, malaria, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS.&nbsp; We will also establish an institution-to-institution partnership to strengthen our approach to reducing health inequalities.&nbsp;&nbsp; We will elevate our partnership on Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights advancing our renewed commitment throughout the 76<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;United Nations General Assembly. .&nbsp; We call on regional, local and national actors to support these efforts.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>We will convene the first U.S.-U.K. Bilateral Cancer Summit and bring together researchers, patients, and other stakeholders to share ideas and identify opportunities for collaboration to accelerate advances in lifesaving approaches to cancer, which remains a leading cause of death worldwide.</li></ol>



<p><strong>COMMITMENT TO NORTHERN IRELAND</strong></p>



<ol start="19"><li>Northern Ireland has taken huge strides forward since its courageous leaders put reconciliation and progress before violence and division 23 years ago. We are proud of the achievements of the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement, and we remain fully committed to its three strand approach, that: established the democratic institutions in Northern Ireland; provided for consultation, co-operation and action across the island of Ireland; and created structures for British-Irish engagement.&nbsp;It took a deep partnership between the U.K., Ireland, and the U.S. to support the people of Northern Ireland in bringing the Troubles to an end, and it will take a continued and ongoing partnership to advance and safeguard Northern Ireland’s stability and prosperity into the future.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Today, the U.K. and U.S. reaffirm their commitment to working closely with all parties to the Agreement to protect its delicate balance and realise its vision for reconciliation, consent, equality, respect for rights, and parity of esteem. Unlocking Northern Ireland’s tremendous potential is a vital part of safeguarding the stability created by the Agreement, and the U.K. and the U.S. will continue working together towards that shared goal.</li></ol>

<p><br>MODERATOR: So, in the interest of time, we&#8217;re going to now move on to the next section of this call. <br><br>So I am going to pass it back to [senior administration official] to preview the President&#8217;s bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the review of the Atlantic Charter.<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Can you hear me?<br><br>MODERATOR:  Yes, go ahead. <br><br>We can&#8217;t hear you if you&#8217;re saying anything.  Are you there?  Apologies, everybody, while we figure out these technical difficulties.  One moment, please. <br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Sorry, guys.  Sorry, sorry.  I&#8217;m here.  I apologize.  I was &#8212; somehow my phone just cut out for a minute, and I was shouting into the void. <br><br>Anyway, on the UK bilateral today, as you all know, the President is meeting with Prime Minister Boris Johnson this afternoon.  And we think it makes all the sense in the world for the President&#8217;s first trip overseas to be to the United Kingdom and for his first foreign leader meeting abroad to be with Prime Minister Johnson because the U.S. and the UK share a Special Relationship that is the foundational aspect of U.S. foreign policy. <br><br>The historic alliance between our two countries is founded on shared values and common beliefs and has worked for decades to ensure that the security and prosperity that we seek to deliver not just for the U.S. and UK, but for the entire world.  And it has become a truly global relationship.<br><br>So, today, the Prime Minister and the President will talk about every aspect of that relationship.  There&#8217;s the security dimension, with an unparalleled defense and security alliance promoting stability worldwide.  There&#8217;s an economic dimension &#8212; the robust economic partnership between our countries sees the UK as our largest investment partner and the fourth-largest trading partner for the United States.<br><br>And, of course, the relationship is also about democratic values.  Together, we &#8212; (audio drop).<br><br>MODERATOR:  Apologies.  I think we lost [senior administration official] for a second.  Give us one moment.<br><br> Thanks for your patience, everyone, as we&#8217;re waiting to get reconnected with [senior administration official].  It should be momentarily.<br><br> I think we have [senior administration official] back on the line now.  If you want to hit &#8220;*6&#8221; and unmute yourself, you can dive right back in.<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Can you guys hear me?<br><br>MODERATOR:  Yes, go ahead.<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I&#8217;m so sorry, guys.  The digital infrastructure here is not agreeing with me. <br><br>I was talking about democratic values.  So, let me just shift to the program.  In terms of the program &#8212; you know, start with a greeting and an official photo.  The two leaders will then review the original Atlantic Charter, which was signed between President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill in 1941 &#8212; so, 80 years ago this year.<br><br>And then, after that, they will have the formal bilateral meeting.  The key priorities that they&#8217;ll focus on in that meeting are, you know, really, the pressing set of global challenges facing our two countries and the whole world: COVID-19, climate change, counterterrorism and the current drawdown in the Afghanistan, the evolving challenges in the Indo-Pacific and the Middle East, the common threats we face from Russia, and so on.<br><br>The two presidents &#8212; the two leaders will also sign a new Atlantic Charter.  The notion is that it&#8217;s been 80 years since the last one; it&#8217;s about time that it gets refreshed.  And the original really outlined what the post-World War world order could and should look like.<br><br>This new charter will make clear what the coming decades of the 21st century can and should look like from the perspective of common values and common aspirations for people everywhere.<br><br>We will also be putting out a joint statement today with some new initiatives that we&#8217;ll commit to work together on in the areas of science, technology, energy, and health.  And that will include the launch of the U.S.-UK Energy Dialogue, led by the Department of Energy; a commitment to a new U.S.-UK science and technology agreement; a launch of an expert working group on opening up travel between the U.S. and UK; and a commitment to hold a U.S.-UK Cancer Summit.<br><br>So, you know, we will be releasing this renewed Atlantic Charter and then releasing the joint statement that includes these core initiatives, in addition to the time the two leaders will spend on a truly robust agenda of current events and long-term trends on all the significant issues that our two countries face.<br><br>So, with apologies for the technical difficulties, I&#8217;m going to stop there.<br><br>MODERATOR:  Thank you so much.  If anybody has any questions about this preview of the bilateral meeting, please use the “raise hand” function on Zoom interface.<br><br>All right.  We will go to David Sanger first.  David, please unmute yourself.<br><br>Q    There we go.  Can you hear me now?<br><br>SENIOR ADMINSTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yes, go ahead.<br><br>Q    Great.  [Senior administration official], I wanted to ask you a little bit about the renewed Atlantic Charter.  So, the initial document, of course, was signed before the U.S. entered the war in 1941.  But over time, it sort of became a standard bearer of the Cold War.  Right?  It laid out the ideological differences between the West and Russia. <br><br>And since the President has been talking so much about democracy versus autocracy, both in a Russia context and a China context, is it your intent that this serves much the same purpose, or is it a different purpose, at a moment that, you know, many people are saying, rightly or wrongly, that we&#8217;re headed into a very different kind of, but equally ideological, struggle?<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  It&#8217;s a great question, David.  I would say: The same purpose in one fundamental respect, and a different purpose in another fundamental respect.  It&#8217;s the same purpose insofar as it is a profound statement of purpose of democracy at a moment when, as the President has said, democracies are very much in competition for autocracies, in terms of showing the world who can deliver for people. <br><br>And this is a statement about why these two leaders, and democratic leaders everywhere, believe that the democratic model is the right and the just and the best model for governance in the world.  And in that sense, it echoes and reflects the fundamental animating purpose of the &#8217;41 document. <br><br>In terms of different purpose insofar as it is not meant to be Cold War &#8212; a new Cold War charter.  It is not meant to pre-stage a new Cold War.  It is meant to pre-stage a much more complex global landscape where the challenges are accelerating and multiplying in ways that involve both great power competitors and significant transnational threats, like climate change or COVID-19, that &#8212; and also, economic and technological challenges that exist at the heart of the interconnected global economy that we have &#8212; an interconnected global economy that didn&#8217;t exist in nearly the same way through the years of the Cold War, given that their economy was divided into these competing blocs. <br><br>So that&#8217;s part of the reason to do it (inaudible) is &#8212; a renewal aspect to the commitment to these democratic principles in the face of genuine challenges and authoritarian competition.  And there&#8217;s the need to refresh and update the statement of principles so they actually reflect the world we&#8217;re dealing with today and not simply harkening back to the world of the Cold War.  And that&#8217;s &#8212; that&#8217;s what this is all about.<br><br>MODERATOR:  Great.  Thank you so much.</p>



<p>12:54 P.M. BST</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; I wanted to ask [senior administration official] about the Johnson meeting just because we only got one question on that.&nbsp; Can you talk a little bit about Northern Ireland specifically and what the President might tell the Prime Minister on that subject?&nbsp; And I would love for you to respond to this report in the Times of the UK, as well, if you could.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; All right, sure.&nbsp; On Northern Ireland, the President is going to say to the Prime Minister what he has said publicly for a long time now, including as recently as St. Patrick&#8217;s Day, which is that he believes that the Good Friday Agreement is the foundation for peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland; that a lot of progress has been made over the 20-plus years since the Good Friday Agreement came into force and that that progress must be protected; and that the outcome of the current discussions between the UK and the EU should ensure the continued vitality of the Good Friday Agreement.</p>



<p>You know, the United States is not in those negotiations and not seeking to be in those negotiations.&nbsp; And we are instead a strong and vigorous supporter of practical, creative, flexible, results-oriented negotiations that, at the end of the day, produce a result that protects all of the gains that the people of Northern Ireland &#8212; that all communities in Northern Ireland have made.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s what he&#8217;s going to say.</p>



<p>It will not be confrontational or adversarial or &#8212; you know, he didn&#8217;t come here to give a lecture.&nbsp; He came merely to communicate what he believes very, very deeply about peace in Northern Ireland, about the priority the United States places on that, about the priority Joe Biden places on that.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s the spirit with which he&#8217;ll approach the conversation.</p>

<p>12:10 P.M. BST<br><br>MODERATOR:  Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you so much for joining us for this background briefing.  In today&#8217;s background briefing, we will cover the United States&#8217; historic vaccine donation that President Biden will announce today.  We will cover a preview of the President&#8217;s bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Boris Johnson.  And last but not least, we&#8217;ll also cover a preview of the G7 Summit and economic deliverables coming out of the G7.<br><br>This call will be on background, attributable to &#8220;senior administration officials.&#8221;  Additionally, (inaudible) invitation, various sections of these calls are under different embargo times, and we will make those sections very clear.<br><br>The portion of the call covering COVID-19 and the vaccine announcement, as well as the preview of the UK bilat, will be embargoed until this call concludes.<br><br>The G7 preview and the section on economic deliverables from the G7 will be embargoed until Friday, June 11th, 7:00 a.m. British Summer Time.<br><br>We&#8217;ll have time for a brief Q&amp;A at the conclusion of each section.<br><br>Not for reporting or attribution, but just for your knowledge, on today&#8217;s call, we have joining us [senior administration officials].<br><br>Before we get started, I wanted to share a quick update from the First Lady&#8217;s office for you all.  In addition to the G7 program of events and meetings, the First Lady will have an independent schedule. <br><br>Today, she will meet separately with Mrs. Carrie Johnson.  Friday, she will participate in the G7 Summit welcoming events; an additional scheduling update is expected for this day.  On Saturday, she will participate in a program for spouses of G7 leaders and will meet with members of Bude Surf Veterans, a local volunteer group that assists UK military veterans with physical or mental health injuries through surfing.  And on Sunday, before she departs, she will meet with UK veterans who participated in Walk of America.<br><br>The First Lady&#8217;s Communications Director, Elizabeth Alexander, and her Press Secretary, Michael LaRosa, are traveling throughout this trip.  Feel free to reach out to them with any questions.<br><br>With that, we’ll get started on the COVID-19 section, and I will pass it over to [senior administration official] to kick us off.<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  All right, well, good morning, everyone, or good afternoon.  And also, thanks for joining us.<br><br>Today, I want to discuss the historic announcement the President will make in his remarks later today regarding our efforts to help vaccinate the world against COVID-19.<br><br>First, let’s talk about why the U.S. is so well-positioned to lead the global COVID-19 response efforts.  And that, of course, is the success of the President’s whole-of-government, wartime effort to respond to the pandemic at home.<br><br>In just over four months, we&#8217;ve vaccinated 64 percent of adult Americans with at least one shot, and, importantly, fully vaccinated 53 percent of adult Americans.  Already, 13 states have 70 percent of adults with at least one shot.<br><br>As a result, in communities and states across the United States, the pandemic is in retreat.  In fact, since President Biden took office, cases are down over 90 percent and deaths are down over 85 percent.<br><br>So, our successful vaccination program isn’t just saving tens of thousands of lives, it’s helping our economy rebound strongly and it’s letting tens of millions of Americans get back to living their lives.<br><br>As the days get brighter and brighter at home, we&#8217;re increasingly focused on driving progress to help end the pandemic around the globe.<br><br>First, it’s the right thing to do.  The U.S. has tragically lost more people to COVID-19 than any other country in the world: almost 600,000 deaths.  Americans have experienced the tragic human cost of this virus, and we want to do everything we can to prevent more tragic loss of life around the globe.<br><br>Second, it&#8217;s in our own national interest to end this pandemic everywhere.  COVID-19 knows no borders.  And as long as this virus has a hold somewhere in the world, Americans are at risk.<br><br>To be clear, as we have learned in the U.S., COVID-19 threatens more than our health; it also threatens economic opportunity and growth.  That’s why the President has committed that the U.S. will be the arsenal of vaccines in our global fight against COVID-19.<br><br>Over the past four and a half months or so, as we have mobilized a whole-of-government effort to vaccinate America, including getting at least one shot to over 170 million Americans and securing enough vaccine supply for all Americans, we have also been mobilizing an effort to help vaccinate the world.<br><br>Under President Biden’s leadership, the U.S. has already contributed more to COVAX than any other country.  We&#8217;ve worked with Japan, India, and Australia to support manufacturing efforts, and shared 4 million AstraZeneca doses with Canada and Mexico.<br><br>Recently, the President also committed to sharing 80 million doses with the world.  Eighty million doses represents 13 percent of the total vaccines produced in the U.S. by the end of this month.  We are working quickly and expeditiously to facilitate safe and secure delivery of these doses, and the initial doses started shipping last week.<br><br>Today, we are taking another major step forward &#8212; a step that will supercharge the global fight against this pandemic and save millions of lives around the world.<br><br>This evening, in the UK, the President will announce that the United States will purchase 500 million doses of Pfizer vaccine and donate them to 100 of the <s>lowest</s> [low]-income countries in the world.<br><br>To repeat, the U.S. is taking this historic step of purchasing half a billion doses of Pfizer vaccine and donating them to countries that need them the most, including the 92 Advance Market Commitment countries &#8212; these are the <s>lowest</s> [low]-income countries and economies in the world &#8212; and <s>all</s> members of the African Union member states.<br><br>This will be, clearly, the largest purchase and donation of COVID-19 vaccines by a single country by far, and it&#8217;s an unprecedented step to respond to an unprecedented pandemic.<br><br>Importantly, this is a vaccine that is proven to be extremely effective against COVID-19 and every known variant of this virus.  And these doses will jumpstart vaccination efforts in some of the most hard-hit and underserved populations in the world, bringing hope to every corner of the world and saving millions of lives.<br><br>[Senior administration official] will explain more about how we will share these doses, but I want to make a few points on timeline.  We expect to start shipping these Pfizer doses in August, with 200 million doses to be delivered this year, and the remaining 300 million to be delivered across the first half of 2022.<br><br>And as with all the vaccines we&#8217;ve committed to sharing, these vaccines will be delivered to countries as quickly and expeditiously as possible as soon as they become available.<br><br>Importantly, these Pfizer vaccines are the product of American ingenuity and innovation.  They will be produced through the power of American manufacturing in places like Michigan, Kansas, Missouri, Connecticut, and Massachusetts &#8212; employing thousands of workers.  American workers who produced vaccines to save American lives are going to produce those same vaccines to save the lives of hundreds of millions of people across the world.<br><br>This is a testament to the American people and American leadership.  We&#8217;re a nation full of people who step up and do their part.  That&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve been doing at home and will continue to do so, vaccinating more and more Americans in the weeks and months to come. <br><br>MODERATOR:  Thank you so much.  With that, I&#8217;m going to pass it over to [senior administration official].<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thanks, everybody.  Just following on [senior administration official]&#8217;s laydown, I want to make clear that not only is the United States taking this huge step to provide 500 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine to low-income countries around the world.  We&#8217;re also using this announcement today to leverage and mobilize larger commitments from the world&#8217;s democracies, from the G7 and partner countries. <br><br>And there will be a G7 COVID-related multilateral announcement coming later on vaccines, but on more than just vaccines &#8212; on a comprehensive roadmap to end the pandemic, with contributions from G7 members to every element of that roadmap. <br><br>So stay tuned for that, because over the course of this weekend at the G7 Summit, American leadership and what [senior administration official] described as &#8220;supercharging the effort&#8221; to provide vaccines around the world will also help catalyze, mobilize, and translate into a collective effort by the world&#8217;s democracies to beat COVID-19 once and for all.<br><br>In terms of this announcement that we&#8217;ve laid out today: It is a monumental commitment by the American people to help people around the world.  And we want to really underscore that this is fundamentally about the singular overarching objective of saving lives, improving livelihoods, and beating a pandemic that has ravaged the world and has spared no quarter from countries on every continent. <br><br>And in this regard, the United States is not seeking favors in exchange for these doses.  We&#8217;re not making demands in order for countries to get these doses.  We are not imposing conditions &#8212; political or economic, or otherwise &#8212; on countries receiving these doses.  We are going to be guided by the science and the public health experts in allocating them to the places where they can make the most difference, and in allocating them in a broad-based way so that countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, in Africa, in Asia, and in parts of Oceania can benefit from these Pfizer doses. <br><br>The other thing to say is that we know that low-income countries would not have an ability to compete with big economies on the vaccine marketplace and that these low-income countries have not had access to groundbreaking vaccines like this mRNA vaccine.  And so part of what we&#8217;re trying to do here is make sure that we are taking &#8212; on the basis of American generosity and American innovation and know-how &#8212; what we have available and getting to those countries who otherwise could not secure it. <br><br>And in addition to that, as [senior administration official] pointed out, I think it bears underscoring: Many of these low-income countries to whom we will be providing these doses &#8212; donating these doses &#8212; are subject to variants of the disease that have made other vaccines somewhat less effective. <br><br>And what has made us focus on the Pfizer vaccine for this significant announcement is that, as [senior administration official] said, it has proven highly effective against every known variant of COVID-19. <br><br>Just two other points before I turn it over for questions.  The first is that we have to connect the doses to shots in arms, just as we have done domestically.  And so the United States has, through the American Rescue Plan, allocated a significant amount of money for every step along the chain of vaccination and of building the resilience of public health systems.  And this monumental commitment of half a billion Pfizer doses will fit into that chain. <br><br>And then, secondly, I just want to reinforce what [senior administration official] said: What this really comes down to at the end of the day is, this is the right thing to do, it&#8217;s the smart thing to do, and it is tangible proof that it is going to be the world&#8217;s democracies who ultimately deliver when it comes to beating the COVID-19 pandemic. <br><br>So let me stop there and turn it back over to the moderator.<br><br>MODERATOR:  Thanks so much.  So, before we move on to some other sections, we have time for some brief Q&amp;A on the vaccines announcement.  So if you have a question, please use the &#8220;raise hand&#8221; function on the Zoom app, and we&#8217;ll call on you before we move on to other sections. <br><br>All right, first, we&#8217;ll go to Michael Shear from the New York Times.<br><br>Q    Hey, guys, thanks for calling on me.  I have two questions.  One is, is there an estimate of how much this is costing the United States to buy the 500 million doses, and the distribution costs, et cetera, that will go along with that?<br><br>And, second, to [senior administration official]&#8217;s point about the doses fitting into a broader process of actually getting them into the arms &#8212; I mean, the United States discovered that doses alone weren&#8217;t enough.  And so, I wonder, is there &#8212; as the United States chooses where to distribute &#8212; which countries to distribute them to, is there going to be some sort of conditionality on whether or not a country actually has a plan or actually has an infrastructure that can distribute them in a way that is effective?  Or is the United States &#8212; is part of the United States&#8217; effort going to be to try to help build that structure up so that the doses don&#8217;t, you know, languish without some sort of distribution ability to kind of get them into people&#8217;s arms?  So, thank you.<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Okay.  This is [senior administration official].  Can you hear me?<br><br>Q    Yes, I can. <br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Sorry, I dropped off before.  I&#8217;ll (inaudible) your question and then I&#8217;ll hand it to [senior administration official]. <br><br>We are entering into the contracting process, so that will determine the final details of the agreement.  We&#8217;ve agreed on a not-for-profit price, and we&#8217;ll assure &#8212; ensure the contract &#8212; the contracting officers will ensure the contract reflects that. <br><br>The contract can be finalized over the coming weeks, and we&#8217;ll make the terms of the contract public.  You know, the U.S. plans to work with COVAX to utilize the second $2 billion in funding that we committed to the fight against the global pandemic.  And we expect, on top of that &#8212; this announcement of 500 million doses will cost about 1.5 billion dollars more, and that will be paid for by the already-appropriated funds from the American Rescue Plan. <br><br>So, back over to [senior administration official] for your question about shots in arms. <br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yeah, as I mentioned at the outset, what you will see coming out of the G7 is a comprehensive roadmap to end the pandemic that focuses not just on securing the necessary supply of vaccines &#8212; supply and production of vaccines, but also on getting those vaccines into arms. <br><br>And the U.S. has already allocated a substantial sum of money through the American Rescue Plan for this purpose.  We have CDC, USAID, and contributions through COVAX &#8212; some of our initial contributions through COVAX &#8212; are going towards this purpose. <br><br>And we will be working both through our own public health and international assistance agencies and through multilateral organizations like UNICEF, and regional organizations like the Pan American Health Organization, to ensure that as we&#8217;re allocating these doses to low-income countries, they also have the capacity to be able to deliver them and get them into arms. <br><br>I would not characterize this as a kind of conditionality where we go to a country and say, “You only get doses if you can do X, Y, and Z” and then, sort of, leave them to it.  I would describe it more as a partnership where, as we allocate these doses across the 500 &#8212; these 500 million doses across the 100 low-income countries, we will work out with each of them a game plan to ensure that those countries that don&#8217;t yet have the capacity to get them from the plane and into the arms of their citizens, that they get the necessary technical assistance, capacity, personnel, cold chain, et cetera, to be able to do this.<br><br>We feel that there is a lot of experience from previous vaccination campaigns that will allow us to surge capacity to hard-hit areas quite quickly, to build up the ability of health systems to do this, and to build on what is already preexisting in certain parts of the world is a fairly strong and robust health system infrastructure for vaccination. <br><br>So we are very mindful of the fact that this has to be part of a multifaceted effort to end the pandemic.  We have resources for that purpose, we have partners for that purpose, and we will be working with the other G7 countries as well to ensure that this is an integrated strategy.<br><br>MODERATOR:  Thanks.  Next, we’ll go to Josh Wingrove from Bloomberg.<br><br>Q    Thank you for doing this.   You cut out when you were talking about the cost of this, and so I just wanted to be clear: Did you say one and a half or five and a half billion (inaudible)?  Can you recap your answer, please, on the cost of these doses, and perhaps also say when you expect the contract will be finalized?<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Sure.  So, we are (inaudible) &#8212; (technical difficulties).<br><br>This is [senior administration official].  I heard Josh for the first part and not the second part.  Can you guys hear me okay?<br><br>MODERATOR:  Yes, we can hear you now.  You were cutting out a little bit, but now this is a lot crisper.<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Okay.  So, let me answer the first part.  I don&#8217;t know &#8212; I don&#8217;t know &#8212; I didn&#8217;t hear the second.  But, you know, we&#8217;re entering into the contracting process, so the contracting officers will determine the final details of the agreement.  You know, the agreement is for a purchase at the not-for-profit price, and we&#8217;ll ensure the contract will reflect that. <br><br>The contract will be finalized over the coming weeks.  Delivery starts in August, of doses, and we’ll make the terms of the contract public at the right point.<br><br>The U.S. plans to work with COVAX to utilize the second $2 billion in funding of the $4 billion that we committed to the fight against the pandemic.  In addition to that, we expect the announcement to cost about $1.5 billion more, so a total of $3.5 [billion], Josh.  And that will be paid for by already-appropriated funds from the American Rescue Plan.<br><br>The one thing that I got cut off on that I know a lot of people have questions on &#8212; let me spend 30 seconds on &#8212; is that today&#8217;s announcement of the 500 million doses to the countries most in need, plus the 80 million doses the President announced in May &#8212; total 580.  So there are &#8212; those are separate announcements.  So the total is 580 million doses to donate to other countries. <br><br>And then, the U.S. will continue to share the additional doses across the summer months, in addition to that 580 million figure.  And we will continue to take additional actions to lead the world&#8217;s efforts to end this global pandemic. <br><br>So, a major milestone today, but I wanted to put it in the context of the work that&#8217;s been done already to share doses and that there&#8217;s more to come.<br><br>MODERATOR:  Thank you so much.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>500 million life-saving vaccines to be delivered by June of next year, including 200 million to be delivered by the end of 2021<br><br>Donation will serve as the foundation for a coordinated effort by the world’s democracies to vaccinate people around the world  </em></p>



<p class="has-text-align-left"><br>Today, President Biden will announce that the United States will purchase and donate half a billion Pfizer vaccines to 92 low- and lower middle-income countries and the African Union, an historic action that will help supercharge the global fight against the pandemic. This is the largest-ever purchase and donation of vaccines by a single country and a commitment by the American people to help protect people around the world from COVID-19. President Biden will also call on the world’s democracies to do their parts in contributing to the global supply of safe and effective vaccines. The goal of today’s donation is to save lives and end the pandemic and will provide the foundation for additional actions to be announced in the coming days.</p>



<p>Thanks to the success of our vaccination program, the United States is beating COVID-19 here at home. 64% of adult Americans have received at least one shot in just four and a half months, daily death rates are lower than at any point in the pandemic, and our economy is rebounding. Now, the United States is using the power of our democracy, the ingenuity of American scientists, and the strength of American manufacturing to beat the pandemic globally by helping to vaccinate the world.</p>



<p>Today’s historic announcement comes on the heels of President Biden’s donation of at least 80 million vaccines from the United States’ supply by the end of June. Additionally, the United States has contributed two billion dollars to COVAX, more than any other nation—and is supporting local production capacity abroad for safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines, including through the Quad initiative.</p>



<p>President Biden has been clear that borders cannot keep this pandemic at bay and has vowed that our nation will be the arsenal of vaccines. The historic step the President will announce today therefore protects the health of the American people and the people throughout the world who will benefit from these life-saving vaccines.</p>



<p>Specifically, the actions the President will announce today will:</p>



<p><strong><u>PROVIDE A HALF BILLION PFIZER VACCINES TO LOW-INCOME NATIONS AROUND THE WORLD:</u></strong> Today, President Biden will announce that the U.S. government will purchase half a billion doses of Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines and donate to 92 low- and lower middle-income countries and economies as defined by <a href="https://www.gavi.org/news/media-room/92-low-middle-income-economies-eligible-access-covid-19-vaccines-gavi-covax-amc">Gavi’s COVAX Advance Market Commitment (AMC)</a> and the African Union. The vaccines will start shipping in August 2021.&nbsp; 200 million doses will be delivered by the end of this year and the remaining 300 million will be delivered in the first half of 2022. The U.S. will allocate these doses to low and lower-middle income nations around the world, working through COVAX to deliver them.</p>



<p><strong><u>GIVE LOWER INCOME NATIONS MORE ACCESS TO HIGHLY EFFECTIVE mRNA VACCINES:</u></strong> Today’s announcement will provide mRNA vaccines that have proven to be highly effective against COVID-19, including against all known variants. Tens of millions of Americans have benefited from these safe and effective vaccines and this historic donation will bring the life-saving benefits these vaccines provide to some of the most vulnerable populations around the world.</p>



<p><strong><u>HARNESS THE POWER OF AMERICAN MANUFACTURING TO HELP SAVE LIVES AROUND THE WORLD.</u></strong> Pfizer plans to produce these half a billion doses in the U.S. at their facilities in Kalamazoo, Michigan, which employs more than 3,000 American workers; McPherson, Kansas, which employs almost 2,000 workers; Chesterfield, Missouri, and Andover, Massachusetts, which employ 700 and 1,800 workers. The American workers who produced vaccines to save American lives will now produce those same vaccines to save the lives of hundreds of millions of people around the world.</p>
