<p>It is disappointing that Senate Republicans voted down consideration of a much-needed bill to purchase vaccines, boosters, and life-saving treatments for the American people. As we have repeatedly said, there are consequences for Congress failing to fund our COVID Response. The program that reimbursed doctors, pharmacists and other providers for vaccinating the uninsured had to end today due to a lack of funds. America’s supply of monoclonal antibodies that are effective at keeping people out of the hospital will run out as soon as late May. Our test manufacturing capacity will begin ramping down at the end of June. Today’s Senate vote is a step backward for our ability to respond to this virus. We will continue to work with the House and Senate to move this vital legislation forward.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">East Room</p>



<p>1:44 P.M. EDT<br><br>VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: &nbsp;Good afternoon.&nbsp; Indeed, it is a good afternoon.&nbsp; Good afternoon.&nbsp; Please have a seat, everybody.&nbsp; Please have a seat.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; It feels good, doesn’t it?&nbsp; (Laughs.)&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br><br>President Biden, President Obama, members of Congress, and my fellow Americans: On March 23rd, 2010, the Affordable Care Act was signed into law.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>In the 12 years since, the ACA has delivered high-quality,<br>affordable healthcare to more than 30 million Americans &#8211;(applause) &#8212; yes.&nbsp; And those Americans are working parents and young children, college students and older Americans &#8212; millions of people who had never been able to afford coverage before or who had been denied coverage altogether, often because of a category of denial called “pre-existing conditions” &#8212; conditions such as cancer, diabetes, hypertension, or even asthma.&nbsp;<br><br>The ACA is the most consequential healthcare legislation passed in generations in our country.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br><br>And it is something more.&nbsp; The ACA is a statement of purpose; a statement about the nation we must be, where all people &#8212; no matter who they are, where they live, or how much they earn &#8212; can access the healthcare they need, no matter the cost.&nbsp;<br><br>You know, when I served as Attorney General of California, it was that purpose that led our office and 10 other state attorneys general to submit a brief to the United States Supreme Court in defense of the ACA.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>And it is that purpose that brings us all together today to continue to expand affordable healthcare and its coverage to families across our nation, and to call on Congress to take action to pass legislation that simply allows Medicare to directly negotiate prescription drug prices with pharmaceutical companies.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>And if there&#8217;s any question why, I’ll explain.&nbsp; More than 60 million Americans are enrolled in Medicare.&nbsp; That would give Medicare significant bargaining power to negotiate prices for all those Americans.&nbsp; So instead of forcing individual patients to negotiate by themselves, to require them to pay whatever price the drug companies set, they would have that kind of representation to stand there with their fellow Americans and negotiate those prices so that they would just simply be fair.<br><br>So, today, we also call on Congress to make permanent the ACA subsidies that are included in the American Rescue Plan &#8212; (applause) &#8212; subsidies that are currently lowering insurance premiums for millions of Americans and which are set to expire in December.&nbsp; And more must be done.&nbsp;<br><br>Currently, there are 12 states in our nation that refuse to expand Medicaid for no reason other than petty partisan obstruction.&nbsp; As a result, 4 million people in our country are locked out of coverage, and that comes at a cost.&nbsp;<br><br>For example, women who do not have healthcare coverage and are, therefore, less likely to have access during pregnancy, or before or after, to pelvic exams or vaccinations, prenatal check-ups, postpartum depression screenings, and all the other essential care they need to be safe and healthy before, during, and after birth.&nbsp;<br><br>We know that expanding Medicaid coverage significantly reduces the number of mothers who die as a result of pregnancy.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; So the sooner coverage is expanded in those 12 states, the more lives we will save.&nbsp;<br><br>Protecting the health and wellbeing of the people of our nation should not be a partisan issue.&nbsp; Every person in our nation should be able to access and afford the healthcare they need to thrive &#8212; not as a privilege, but as a right.&nbsp;<br><br>And that is why our administration will continue to use every tool at our disposal to strengthen the ACA.<br><br>And with that &#8212; (applause) &#8212; it is now my great pleasure to introduce the man whose vision and leadership led us to this day, whose unwavering commitment to the people of our nation laid the foundation for this groundbreaking legislation; a leader who showed us the way forward on this important issue.<br><br>Please welcome President Barack Obama.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>PRESIDENT OBAMA:&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Thank you, everybody.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Thank you very much.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Thank you, everybody.&nbsp; Have a seat.&nbsp; Have a seat.&nbsp; Thank you.<br><br>Vice President Biden, Vice President &#8212; (laughter) &#8212; that was a joke.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; (President Obama hugs President Biden.) &nbsp;That was all set up.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;<br><br>My President, Joe Biden; Vice President Harris &#8212; (applause) &#8212; our dear friend, Madam Speaker, Nancy Pelosi &#8212; (applause) &#8212; all the members of Congress who are in attendance today, the members of the Cabinet: It is good to be back in the White House.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; It’s been a while.&nbsp;<br><br>I confess I heard some changes have been made &#8212; (laughter) &#8212; by the current President, since I was last here.&nbsp; Apparently, Secret Service agents have to wear aviator glasses now.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; The Navy Mess has been replaced by a Baskin Robbins.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; And there’s &#8212; there’s a cat running around &#8212; (laughter) &#8212; which I guarantee you Bo and Sunny would have been very unhappy about.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;<br><br>But coming back &#8212; even if I have to wear a tie, which I very rarely do these days &#8212; (laughter) &#8212; gives me a chance to visit with some of the incredible people who serve this White House and who serve this country every single day, a lot of times out of the limelight.&nbsp; They make this government function, and they help people in ways big and small.&nbsp;<br><br>And &#8212; and from the outside, sometimes people don’t understand just how grueling this is and how many sacrifices people make, because those of us who are in front of the cameras oftentimes get the credit.&nbsp; But it’s a lot of people who are devoted day in, day out to making this country better that matter, and a lot of them are represented here.&nbsp; And that’s not just in the West Wing, by the way.&nbsp; It’s also in the Residence.&nbsp; There were a lot of people who looked after our families that I will always be grateful to.&nbsp;<br><br>So, it’s wonderful to be back to say thank you to all of you.&nbsp; But most of all, coming back here gives me a chance to say thank you and spend some time with an extraordinary friend and partner who was by my side for eight years.<br><br>Joe Biden and I did a lot together.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; We helped save the global economy, made record investments in clean energy.&nbsp; We put guardrails on our financial system.&nbsp; We helped turn the auto industry around.&nbsp; Repealed “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell.”&nbsp; But nothing made me prouder than providing better healthcare and more protections to millions of people across this country.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br><br>So &#8212; so when President Biden said he was not going to just celebrate the ACA, but also announce actions that would make it even better, I had to show up.&nbsp; (Laughter.)<br><br>I think it’s been well documented just how difficult it was to pass the ACA.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; There &#8212; there’s &#8212; you can get a lot of testimony here, in case folks haven’t heard.<br><br>As a country, we had been talking about reforming healthcare for 100 years.&nbsp; Unlike almost every other advanced economy on Earth, we didn’t have a system that guaranteed access to healthcare for all of its citizens.&nbsp; Millions of people didn’t have health insurance, often because their employers didn’t provide it or because it was too expensive.<br><br>But despite the fact that our healthcare system didn’t work well, it was hard to change.&nbsp; Healthcare represents about one-fifth of our economy; that’s trillions of dollars that are involved.&nbsp; So there were a lot of different economic interests that were vying to maintain the status quo.<br><br>And because the majority of Americans did have healthcare, some people naturally worried that they’d lose what they had.&nbsp; The media was skeptical of past failures.&nbsp; There was a lot of misinformation, to say the least, flying around.&nbsp; And it’s fair to say that most Republicans showed little interest in working with us to get anything done.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; That’s fair to say.<br><br>But despite great odds, Joe and I were determined, because we’d met too many people on the campaign trail who’d shared their stories, and our own families had been touched by illness.<br><br>And as I said to our dear friend Harry Reid, who is missed &#8212; wish he was here today, because he took great pride in what we did &#8212; I intended to get healthcare passed even if it cost me reelection &#8212; which, for a while, it looked like it might.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>But for all of us &#8212; for Joe, for Harry, for Nancy Pelosi, for others &#8212; the ACA was an example of why you run for office in the first place, why all of you sign up for doing jobs that pay you less than you can make someplace else; why you’re away from home sometimes and you miss some soccer practices or some dance recitals.<br><br>Because we don’t &#8212; we’re not supposed to do this just to occupy a seat or to hang on to power.&nbsp; We’re supposed to do this because it’s making a difference in the lives of the people who sent us here.&nbsp;<br><br>And because of so many people, including a lot of people who are here today, made enormous sacrifices; because members of Congress took courageous votes, including some who knew that their vote would likely cost them their seat; because of the incredible leadership of Nancy and Harry, we got the ACA across the finish line together.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br><br>And the night we passed the ACA &#8212; I’ve said it before &#8212; it was a high point of my time here, because it reminded me and it reminded us of what is possible.<br><br>But, of course, our work was not finished.&nbsp; Republicans tried to repeal what we had done &#8212; again, and again, and again.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; And they filed lawsuits that went all the way to the Supreme Court three times.&nbsp;&nbsp;I see Don Verrilli here who had to defend a couple of them.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br><br>They tried explicitly to make it harder for people to sign up for coverage.&nbsp;<br><br>And let&#8217;s face it: It didn&#8217;t help that when we first rolled out the ACA, the website didn&#8217;t work.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; That was not one of my happiest moments.&nbsp; (Laughter.)<br><br>So, given all the noise and the controversy and the skepticism, it took a while for the American people to understand what we had done.&nbsp; But lo and behold, a little later than I&#8217;d expected, a lot of folks, including many who had initially opposed healthcare reform, came around.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>And today, the ACA hasn&#8217;t just survived; it&#8217;s pretty darn popular.&nbsp; And the reason is because it&#8217;s done what it was supposed to do.&nbsp; It&#8217;s made a difference.<br><br>First, 20 million and now 30 million people have gotten covered thanks to the ACA.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br><br>It&#8217;s &#8212; it’s prevented insurance companies from denying people coverage based on a pre-existing condition.&nbsp; It&#8217;s lowered prescription drug costs for 12 million seniors.&nbsp; It&#8217;s allowed young people to stay on their parents’ plan until they&#8217;re 26.&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#8217;s eliminated lifetime limits on benefits that often put people in a jam.<br><br>So, we are incredibly proud of that work.&nbsp;<br><br>But the reason we&#8217;re here today is because President Biden, Vice President Harris, everybody who has worked on this thing understood from the start that the ACA wasn&#8217;t perfect.&nbsp; To get the bill passed, we had to make compromises.&nbsp; We didn&#8217;t get everything we wanted.&nbsp; That wasn&#8217;t a reason not to do it.&nbsp; If you can get millions of people health coverage and better protection, it is &#8212; to quote a famous American &#8212; a pretty “big deal.”&nbsp; (Laughter and applause.)&nbsp; That’s what it is.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; A big deal.<br><br>But there were gaps to be filled.&nbsp; Even today, some patients still pay too much for their prescriptions.&nbsp; Some poor Americans are still falling through the cracks.&nbsp; In some cases, healthcare subsidies aren&#8217;t where we want them to be, which means that some working families are still having trouble paying for their coverage.<br><br>Here&#8217;s the thing: That&#8217;s not unusual when we make major progress in this country.&nbsp; The original Social Security Act left out entire categories of people, like domestic workers and farm workers.&nbsp; That had to be changed.&nbsp; In the beginning, Medicare didn&#8217;t provide all the benefits that it does today.&nbsp; That had to be changed.<br><br>Throughout history, what you see is that it&#8217;s important to get something started, to plant a flag, to lay a foundation for further progress.<br><br>The analogy I&#8217;ve used about the ACA before is that: In the same way that was true for early forms of Social Security and Medicare, it was a starter home.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; It secured the principle of universal healthcare, provided help immediately to families.&nbsp; But it required us to continually build on it and make it better.<br><br>And President Biden understands that.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s what he&#8217;s done since the day he took office.&nbsp; As part of the American Rescue Plan, he lowered the cost of healthcare even further for millions of people.&nbsp; He made signing up easier.&nbsp; He made outreach to those who didn&#8217;t know they could get covered &#8212; make sure that they knew; made that a priority.&nbsp;<br><br>And as a result of these actions, he helped a record 14.5 million Americans get covered during the most recent enrollment period.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br><br>That, ladies and gentlemen, is what happens when you have an administration that&#8217;s committed to making a program work.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>And today &#8212; today, the Biden-Harris administration is going even further by moving to fix a glitch in the regulations that will lower premiums for nearly 1 million people who need it and allow 200,000 more uninsured Americans get access to coverage.&nbsp;<br><br>I&#8217;m a private citizen now, but I still take more than a passing interest in the course of our democracy.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; But I&#8217;m outside the arena, and I know how discouraged people can get with Washington &#8212; Democrats, Republicans, independents.&nbsp; Everybody feels frustrated sometimes about what takes place in this town.&nbsp; Progress feels way too slow sometimes.&nbsp; Victories are often incomplete.&nbsp; And in a country as big and as diverse as ours, consensus never comes easily.&nbsp;<br><br>But what the Affordable Care Act shows is that if you are driven by the core idea that, together, we can improve the lives of this generation and the next, and if you&#8217;re persistent &#8212; if you stay with it and are willing to work through the obstacles and the criticism and continually improve where you fall short, you can make America better &#8212; you can have an impact on millions of lives.&nbsp; You can help make sure folks don&#8217;t have to lose their homes when they get sick, that they don&#8217;t have to worry whether a loved one is going to get the treatment they need.<br><br>President Joe Biden understands that.&nbsp; He has dedicated his life to the proposition that there&#8217;s something worthy about public service and that the reason to run for office is for days like today.<br><br>So, I could not be more honored to be here with him as he writes the next chapter in our story of progress.&nbsp; I&#8217;m grateful for all the people who have been involved in continuing to make the ACA everything it can be.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>And it is now my great privilege to introduce the 46th President of the United States, Joe Biden.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br><br>PRESIDENT BIDEN:&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Thank you, thank you, thank you.&nbsp; Please.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Thank you, thank you, thank you.&nbsp; Please.&nbsp; Tha- &#8212; (applause.)&nbsp; Please.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Thank you very much.&nbsp; Please.<br><br>My name is Joe Biden, and I&#8217;m Barack Obama’s Vice President.&nbsp; (Laughter and applause.)&nbsp; And I&#8217;m Jill Biden’s husband.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; By the way, the only reason Jill is not here today: She&#8217;s working. &nbsp;(Laughter.) &nbsp;She&#8217;s teaching.&nbsp;<br><br>PRESIDENT OBAMA:&nbsp; I hear you.&nbsp;<br><br>PRESIDENT BIDEN:&nbsp; And so I just want you to know that’s why she&#8217;s not here.<br><br>Good afternoon, everyone.&nbsp; Mr. President, welcome back to the White House, man.&nbsp; It feels like the good old days. &nbsp;(Applause.)&nbsp; Being here with you brings back so many good memories.&nbsp; We just had lunch together, and we weren’t sure who was supposed to sit where.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;<br><br>Look, it’s fitting that the first time you return to the White House is to celebrate a law &#8212; a law that’s transforming millions of lives because of you.&nbsp; And I say “because of you.”&nbsp; We had a lot of help &#8212; the staff and I helped a little bit &#8212; but it was because of you.&nbsp; A law that shows hope leads to change.&nbsp; And you did that.&nbsp; You did it.<br><br>Let’s be honest: The Affordable Care Act has been called a lot of things, but “Obamacare” is the most fitting.&nbsp; (Laughter and applause.) “Obamacare.”&nbsp; It’s true.&nbsp;<br><br>I can tell you all how much Barack Obama cared about getting this done.&nbsp; Throughout the countless hours of negotiations and the relentless political attacks, he never, ever, ever gave up.&nbsp; And I guarantee you that.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>If I had time, I could tell you all the times when he&#8217;d say, “Should we compromise, should we do…”&nbsp; And I’d say, “Well, we ought to think about that.”&nbsp; “No, if I do that, then so and so won&#8217;t get covered.&nbsp; This group of people won&#8217;t get covered.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>And whether it was after meeting or &#8212; or during our weekly lunch &#8212; and we met every single day &#8212; he’d remind me why we were doing this in the first place.<br><br>We were doing this, in the first place, for people who needed it and deserved to be treated with dignity. &nbsp;Dignity.&nbsp; The idea that when you can&#8217;t afford health insurance for your children, for your spouse, male or female &#8212; it doesn&#8217;t matter: Not only are they in trouble, but you&#8217;re deprived of your dignity.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Barack, you talked about the idea that it was important that we make sure that you couldn&#8217;t outrun your insurance.&nbsp; I can remember there with &#8212; with Beau, thinking to myself, “What would I do if they walked in and said ‘You’ve outrun your time here,’ and there was still 35 days to live?”&nbsp; The things that change people&#8217;s lives.&nbsp;<br><br>We both understood the Affordable Care Act wasn’t about a single president or the presidency.&nbsp; It was about the countless &#8212; countless Americans lying in bed at night, staring at the ceiling, wondering, “My God &#8212; my God, what if I get really sick?&nbsp; What am I going to do?&nbsp; What is my family going to do?&nbsp; Will I lose the house?”&nbsp; Discussions we had in my house with my dad when he lost his health insurance &#8212; “Who’s going to pay for it?&nbsp; Who’s going to take care of my family?”&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>You know, in America, healthcare &#8212; as we all three said, will have now said &#8212; healthcare should be a right, not a privilege.<br><br>And &#8212; (applause) &#8212; with &#8212; with the help of members of Congress, especially Nancy, and the advocates for families who are here today, 12 years ago last month &#8212; 12 years ago, we made a good effort toward that proposition &#8212; that it should be a right.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>When &#8212; and, Barack, when you signed the Affordable Care Act into law, it became the most consequential piece of health insurance &#8212; most consequential piece of legislation, in my view &#8212; since the creation of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965.&nbsp; It made a difference in people’s lives every day.&nbsp;<br><br>You just talked about where we were before the Affordable Care Act and what happened in the past 12 years to make life a lot better for people.<br><br>Well, I’d like to talk about where we go from here, because &#8212; because we knew back then, as Barack &#8212; as the President said, we knew that we had to keep strengthening this legislation.<br><br>Look, that’s why I ran for President and I promised to protect and build upon the Affordable Care Act.<br><br>As soon as I entered office, that’s exactly what Kamala and I did and what our administration and the Democrats in Congress here today did.&nbsp; We passed the landmark American Rescue Plan, which not only helped us on the COVID-19 &#8212; get it under control and our economy back on track, it got millions more people insured under the Affordable Care Act.<br><br>It made it easier for people to sign up for coverage in the middle of a pandemic.&nbsp; It opened a special enrollment&nbsp;<s>people</s>&nbsp;[period] and gave millions and millions of Americans more time to enroll.&nbsp; It quadrupled the number of navigators out there in the communities helping people to sign up for coverage because it was confusing to people.&nbsp; It’s confusing.&nbsp;<br><br>The President has heard me say when we worked together &#8212; you know how they’d say, “Well, Biden and Obama are doing great on foreign policy.”&nbsp; I said, “You want to do something difficult?&nbsp; Try healthcare.”&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Not a joke.&nbsp; Not a joke.<br><br>So we continue to expand Medicaid.&nbsp; Missouri and Oklahoma became the 37th and 38th states to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.&nbsp; (Applause.) &nbsp;<br><br>And as has been mentioned, over 31 million people now have health insurance through the Affordable Care Act.&nbsp; Four out of five Americans can find quality coverage for under $10 a month.<br><br>The average family &#8212; (applause) &#8212; the average family is saving $2,400 a year on their premiums.&nbsp; That’s $200 every single month available for other needs in their lives &#8212; from gas to groceries, to other basic necessities.<br><br>The bottom line is this: The Affordable Care Act is stronger now than it has ever been.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>And today &#8212; (applause) &#8212; and I’m not even talking about what your former Chief of Staff is doing to make sure healthcare is available to all our veterans in the way he did.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>PRESIDENT OBAMA:&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp;<br><br>PRESIDENT BIDEN:&nbsp; And today, we’re strengthening it even further.&nbsp; In a moment, I’m going to sign an executive order building on one of those that I signed last year.<br><br>It directs federal agencies to continue doing everything in their power &#8212; everything in their power to expand quality and affordable healthcare coverage: making it easier for people to enroll in and keep their coverage; helping people better understand their coverage options and to pick &#8212; to be able to pick the best option for that family; taking steps to strengthen benefits, lower costs, and expand eligibility; protecting Americans from low-quality coverage that can lead to a mountain of medical debt.<br><br>And, folks &#8212; and, separately, it’s time to fix what we refer to as the “family glitch.”&nbsp; Now, the family glitch, to all &#8212; everybody in this room probably knows what it is.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; But it&#8217;s a common issue facing 5 million Americans who can’t get financial help to get coverage under the Affordable Care Act.<br><br>And here&#8217;s the problem: Under the current rules, a working mom is told: As long as she can afford employer-based coverage for herself, she can’t qualify for premium subsidies to afford coverage for her family.&nbsp; It’ll cover her, but not her family.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>But we’re going to change that.&nbsp; Once today’s proposed rule is finalized, starting next year, working families in America will get the help they need to afford full family coverage &#8212; everyone in the family.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br><br>As &#8212; as a redult [sic] &#8212; as a result, families will be saving hundreds of dollars a month.&nbsp; With this change, it’s estimated that 200,000 presently uninsured Americans are going to gain coverage.<br><br>Nearly 1 million Americans will see their coverage become more affordable.&nbsp; This is considered one of the biggest things my administration can do: lower costs and expand coverage.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re taking steps today to get that done.&nbsp;<br><br>So, look, folks &#8212; but we need &#8212; we need to keep up the fight.&nbsp; Our Republican colleagues, as they say in southern Delaware, “They haven&#8217;t changed a whole hell of a lot.”&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Good folks, but they haven&#8217;t changed a lot.&nbsp; They continue to attack the Affordable Care Act.&nbsp; They&#8217;re unrelenting.&nbsp; Unrelenting.&nbsp; They haven&#8217;t stopped.<br><br>Mr. President, since you signed the law, they haven&#8217;t stopped for one second.&nbsp; Multiple court challenges, you mentioned.&nbsp; Sabotage from the previous administration.&nbsp; Over 70 attempts to repeal the law by Republicans in Congress.&nbsp;<br><br>In fact, just last month, the distinguished senator from Wisconsin said: If Republicans get back in power, they should try to repeal the Affordable Care Act again &#8212; again try.<br><br>Today, 12 years later, Republicans have not stopped their attacks on this lifesaving law.<br><br>So, pay very close attention, folks: If Republicans have their way, it means 100 million Americans with pre-existing conditions can once again be denied healthcare coverage by their insurance companies.&nbsp; That&#8217;s what the law was before Obamacare.&nbsp;<br><br>In addition, tens of millions of Americans could lose their coverage, including young people who will no longer be able to stay on their parents’ insurance policy to age 26.&nbsp; Premiums are going to go through the roof.&nbsp;<br><br>Well, I got a better idea: Instead of destroying the Affordable Care Act, let&#8217;s keep building on it.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Let&#8217;s extend it.&nbsp; Extend.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br><br>And because of all the &#8212; all the folks in this room, the members of Congress, the American Rescue Plan subsidies &#8212; subsidizes that are lowering premiums &#8212; subsidies are lowering premiums and extending coverage.&nbsp;<br><br>And I got a little practice when you gave me that other act, you know, when we were President &#8212; when you were President and I was with you.&nbsp; (Laughter.)<br><br>Look, close the Medicaid coverage gap that locks nearly 4 million Americans out of coverage just because their state has refused to expand Medicaid.&nbsp; Lower prescription drug costs, which was mentioned already, by allowing Medicare to negotiate prices for drugs that are on the market.<br><br>We can do this.&nbsp; We should do this.&nbsp; We have to do this.<br><br>But let me close with this:&nbsp;Twelve years ago, at a bill signing of the Affordable Care Act, President Obama said, quote, “We&#8217;re a nation that does what is hard, what is necessary, and what is right.”&nbsp; That&#8217;s exactly what he did.&nbsp; Exactly what he did.&nbsp;<br><br>And, folks, that&#8217;s what we have to do.&nbsp; It’s what we do as Americans.&nbsp; You know, it&#8217;s what all of you did here in making the Affordable Care Act possible.&nbsp; I really mean it.&nbsp;<br><br>We just keep it &#8212; we just got to keep it going and keep building on it.&nbsp; We need to keep the faith.&nbsp; And we need to remember: We&#8217;re the United States of America, and there&#8217;s simply &#8212; literally &#8212; nothing beyond our capacity when we&#8217;re united and do it together.&nbsp;<br><br>So, God bless you all, and may God protect our troops.&nbsp; And now I&#8217;m going to sign an executive order.&nbsp;<br><br>And, Barack, let me remind you: It&#8217;s a hot mic.&nbsp; (Laughter and applause.)<br><br>I have to admit one thing I haven&#8217;t gotten down &#8212; Barack Obama could sign his name using nine different pens.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; But I’m going to use one.<br><br>(The executive order is signed.)&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>2:22 P.M. EDT</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>



<p>Section 1. &nbsp;Policy. &nbsp;On January 28, 2021, I signed Executive Order 14009 (Strengthening Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act), establishing that it is the policy of my Administration to protect and strengthen Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and to make high-quality healthcare accessible and affordable for every American.&nbsp; It directs executive departments and agencies (agencies) with authorities and responsibilities related to Medicaid and the ACA to review existing regulations, orders, guidance documents, policies, and any other similar agency actions (collectively, agency actions) to determine whether such agency actions are inconsistent with this policy.</p>



<p>Consistent with Executive Order 14009, agencies have taken numerous actions to protect and strengthen Medicaid and the ACA, including:</p>



<p>(a)&nbsp; facilitating the expansion of Medicaid in Missouri and Oklahoma to individuals below 138 percent of the Federal poverty level, which is projected to cover nearly half a million people;</p>



<p>(b)&nbsp; extending Medicaid eligibility to new populations in order to allow pregnant individuals to retain their Medicaid coverage for up to 1 year postpartum, including through initiatives in Illinois, New Jersey, Virginia, and Louisiana;</p>



<p>(c)&nbsp; operating a Special Enrollment Period during 2021 that allowed 2.8 million Americans to newly enroll in coverage under the ACA;</p>



<p>(d)&nbsp; extending the length of the HealthCare.gov Open Enrollment Period by 1 month and operating the most successful Open Enrollment Period ever, with a historic 14.5 million Americans enrolling in coverage through the ACA Marketplaces and an additional 1 million people enrolling in Basic Health Program coverage, resulting in a 20 percent increase over the prior year across both programs combined;</p>



<p>(e)&nbsp; increasing outreach and enrollment funding for organizations that help Americans apply for ACA and Medicaid coverage, including quadrupling the number of trained Navigators to more than 1,500 people in States using HealthCare.gov;</p>



<p>(f)&nbsp; lowering maximum out-of-pocket costs for consumers with employer and ACA coverage by $400 in 2022;</p>



<p>(g)  reducing paperwork burdens for people enrolling in Medicaid and the ACA by eliminating unnecessary documentation requirements;</p>



<p>(h)&nbsp; allowing low-income Americans to enroll in affordable ACA coverage year-round;</p>



<p>(i)&nbsp; strengthening Medicaid and ACA section 1332 waiver policies to partner with States to develop innovative coverage options, strengthen benefits, and lower costs;</p>



<p>(j)&nbsp; proposing rules that would better ensure comprehensive and standardized coverage and improve the adequacy of ACA provider networks; and</p>



<p>(k)&nbsp; making efforts to improve the affordability of ACA coverage for families by proposing rules to correct a regulatory gap that prevents family members from accessing ACA subsidies despite very high premiums for coverage through an employer.</p>



<p>On March 11, 2021, I signed into law the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2), which will further strengthen Medicaid and the ACA in numerous ways, including by making ACA coverage more affordable for 9 million Americans through enhanced ACA subsidies, incentivizing States to adopt the ACA&#8217;s Medicaid expansion, making it easier for States to extend postpartum Medicaid coverage, establishing new options for States to establish mobile crisis intervention services teams to help provide services to Medicaid beneficiaries experiencing a behavioral health crisis, and increasing Medicaid funding for home- and community-based services to strengthen and expand access to services for millions of seniors and people with disabilities who need care as well as to help States strengthen their programs.</p>



<p>My Administration has made significant progress in making healthcare more affordable and accessible to millions of Americans.&nbsp; From the end of 2020 to September 2021, one in seven uninsured Americans gained coverage, leaving the uninsured rate at nearly an all-time low.&nbsp; Despite this progress, nearly 4&nbsp;million Americans continue to be locked out of Medicaid expansion because they reside in 1 of the 12 States that have failed to adopt the ACA&#8217;s Medicaid expansion. &nbsp;In addition, millions more continue to struggle to obtain the care they need, to go without health coverage, or to be enrolled in coverage that is insufficient to meet their needs.&nbsp; The effects of being uninsured or underinsured can be devastating financially, as families without access to affordable coverage may accrue high levels of medical debt.</p>



<p>It remains the policy of my Administration to protect and strengthen Medicaid and the ACA and to make high-quality healthcare accessible and affordable for every American. &nbsp;Agencies with authorities and responsibilities related to Medicaid and the ACA are continuing their review of existing agency actions under Executive Order 14009.</p>



<p>Sec. 2. &nbsp;Agency Responsibilities. &nbsp;In addition to taking the actions directed pursuant to Executive Order 14009, agencies (as described in section 3502(1) of title 44, United States Code, except for the agencies described in section 3502(5) of title 44, United States Code) with responsibilities related to Americans&#8217; access to health coverage shall review agency actions to identify ways to continue to expand the availability of affordable health coverage, to improve the quality of coverage, to strengthen benefits, and to help more Americans enroll in quality health coverage. &nbsp;As part of this review, the heads of such agencies shall examine the following:</p>



<p>(a) &nbsp;policies or practices that make it easier for all consumers to enroll in and retain coverage, understand their coverage options, and select appropriate coverage;</p>



<p>(b) &nbsp;policies or practices that strengthen benefits and improve access to healthcare providers;</p>



<p>(c) &nbsp;policies or practices that improve the comprehensiveness of coverage and protect consumers from low-quality coverage;</p>



<p>(d) &nbsp;policies or practices that expand eligibility and lower costs for coverage in the ACA Marketplaces, Medicaid, Medicare, and other programs;</p>



<p>(e) &nbsp;policies or practices that help improve linkages between the healthcare system and other stakeholders to address health-related needs; and</p>



<p>(f) &nbsp;policies or practices that help reduce the burden of medical debt on households.</p>



<p>Sec. 3.&nbsp; General Provisions.&nbsp; (a)&nbsp; Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:</p>



<p>(i)&nbsp;&nbsp; the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or</p>



<p>(ii)&nbsp; the functions of the Director of the Office of&nbsp;Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.</p>



<p>(b)&nbsp; This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.</p>



<p>(c)&nbsp; This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-right">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.</p>

<p>MEMORANDUM FOR THE HEADS OF EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES</p>



<p>SUBJECT:      Addressing the Long-Term Effects of COVID-19 </p>



<p>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline">Section 1</span>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Policy</span>.  My Administration has made combating the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and guiding the Nation through the worst public health crisis in more than a century, our top priority.  When I came into office, COVID-19 was wreaking havoc on our country &#8212; closing our businesses, keeping our kids out of school, and forcing us into isolation.  Today, America has the tools to protect against COVID-19 and to dramatically decrease its risks.  We move towards a future in which COVID-19 does not disrupt our daily lives and is something we prevent, protect against, and treat.<br><br>As we chart the path forward, we remember the more than 950,000 people in the United States lost to COVID-19.  They were beloved parents, grandparents, children, siblings, spouses, neighbors, and friends.  More than 200,000 children in the United States have lost a parent or caregiver to the disease.  Each soul is irreplaceable, and the families and communities left behind are still reeling from profound loss.  Many families and communities have already received support from Federal programs that help with the loss they have experienced.  As we move forward, we commit to ensuring that families and communities can access these support programs and connect to resources they may need to help with their healing, health, and well-being.<br><br>At the same time, many of our family members, neighbors, and friends continue to experience negative long-term effects of COVID-19.  Many individuals report debilitating, long-lasting effects of having been infected with COVID-19, often called &#8220;long COVID.&#8221;  These symptoms can happen to anyone who has had COVID-19 &#8212; including individuals across ages, races, genders, and ethnicities; individuals with or without disabilities; individuals with or without underlying health conditions; and individuals whether or not they had initial symptoms.  Individuals experiencing long COVID report experiencing new or recurrent symptoms, which can include anxiety and depression, fatigue, shortness of breath, difficulty concentrating, heart palpitations, disordered sleep, chest and joint pain, headaches, and other symptoms.  These symptoms can persist long after the acute COVID-19 infection has resolved.  Even young people and otherwise healthy people have reported long COVID symptoms that last for many months.  These symptoms may be affecting individuals&#8217; ability to work, conduct daily activities, engage in educational activities, and participate in their communities.  Our world-class research and public health organizations have begun the difficult work of understanding these new conditions, their causes, and potential prevention and treatment options.  Our health care and support programs are working to help meet the needs of individuals experiencing the lasting effects of COVID-19.  To organize the Federal Government&#8217;s response, executive departments and agencies (agencies) must work together to use the expertise, resources, and benefit programs of the Federal Government to ensure that we are accelerating scientific progress and providing individuals with the support and services they need.<br><br>In addition, the American public is grappling with a mental health crisis exacerbated by the pandemic. Too many have felt the effects of social isolation, sickness, economic insecurity, increased caregiver burdens, and grief.  My Administration has made significant investments in mental health as well as substance use disorder prevention, treatment, and recovery support for the American public, including by expanding access to community-based behavioral health services.  We are committed to advancing these behavioral health efforts in order to better identify the effects of the pandemic on mental health, substance use, and well-being, and to take steps to address these effects for the people we serve.<br><br>Our Nation can continue to protect the public &#8212; and spare countless families from the deepest pain imaginable &#8212; if everybody does their part.  Today, we have numerous tools to protect ourselves and our loved ones from COVID-19 &#8212; from vaccines to tests, treatments, masks, and more.  My Administration recognizes the toll of this pandemic on the American public and commits to redoubling our efforts to support the American people in addressing the long-term effects of COVID-19 on their lives and on society.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Organizing the Government-Wide Response to the Long-Term Effects of COVID-19</span>.  (a)  The Secretary of Health and Human Services (Secretary) shall coordinate the Government-wide response to the long-term effects of COVID-19.  My Administration will harness the full potential of the Federal Government, in coordination with public- and private-sector partners, to mount a full and effective response.  The Secretary shall report on the coordination efforts to the Coordinator of the COVID-19 Response and Counselor to the President and to the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy.<br><br>     (b)  The heads of agencies shall assist and provide information to the Secretary, consistent with applicable law, as may be necessary to carry out the Secretary&#8217;s duties described in subsection (a) of this section.<br><br>     (c)  In performing the duties described in subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary shall seek information from relevant nongovernmental experts, organizations, and stakeholders, including individuals affected directly by the long-term effects of COVID-19.  The Secretary shall consider using all available legal authorities, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, to assist in gathering relevant information, including a waiver under 42 U.S.C. 247d(f).<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Report on the Long-Term Effects of COVID-19</span>.  The Secretary, supported within the Department of Health and Human Services by the Assistant Secretary for Health and the Assistant Secretary for Mental Health and Substance Use, shall publish a public report within 120 days of the date of this memorandum outlining services and mechanisms of support across agencies to assist the American public in the face of the far-reaching and long-term effects of COVID-19.  The report shall outline Federal Government services to support individuals experiencing long COVID, individuals and families experiencing a loss due to COVID-19, and all those grappling with mental health and substance use issues in the wake of this pandemic.  The report shall also specifically address the long-term effects of COVID-19 on underserved communities and efforts to address disparities in availability and adoption of services and support for such communities.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">National Research Action Plan on Long COVID</span>.  (a)  Coordinated efforts across the public and private sectors are needed to advance progress in prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and provision of services for individuals experiencing long COVID.  The Secretary, supported by the Assistant Secretary for Health and in collaboration with the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of Energy, and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, shall coordinate a Government-wide effort to develop the first-ever interagency national research agenda on long COVID, to be reflected in a National Research Action Plan.  The National Research Action Plan will build on ongoing efforts across the Federal Government, including the landmark RECOVER Initiative implemented by the National Institutes of Health.  The Secretary shall release the jointly developed National Research Action Plan within 120 days of the date of this memorandum.<br><br>     (b)  The National Research Action Plan shall build upon existing research efforts and include strategies to:<br><br>          (i)     help measure and characterize long COVID in both children and adults, including with respect to its frequency, severity, duration, risk factors, and trends over time;<br><br>          (ii)    support the development of estimates on prevalence and incidence of long COVID disaggregated by demographic groups and symptoms;<br><br>          (iii)   better understand the epidemiology, course of illness, risk factors, and vaccine effectiveness in prevention of long COVID;<br><br>          (iv)    advance our understanding of the health and socioeconomic burdens on individuals affected by long COVID, including among different race and ethnicity groups, pregnant people, and those with underlying disabilities;<br><br>          (v)     foster development of new treatments and care models for long COVID based on a better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of the SARS-CoV-2 virus;<br><br>          (vi)    inform decisions related to high-quality support, services, and interventions for long COVID;<br><br>          (vii)   improve data-sharing between agencies and academic and industry researchers about long COVID, to the extent permitted by law; and<br><br>          (viii)  specifically account for the pandemic&#8217;s effect on underserved communities and rural populations.<br><br>Sec. 5.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:<br><br>          (i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or<br><br>          (ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.<br><br>     (b)  This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.<br><br>     (c)  This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.<br><br>     (d)  The Secretary is authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the <em>Federal Register</em>.<br><br></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>The U.S. has made tremendous progress in our fight against COVID-19. Today, Americans have the tools they need to protect against and treat the virus. At the same time, millions of individuals continue to experience prolonged illness from COVID-19, known as “Long COVID.” Many report debilitating, lasting symptoms that can persist long after the acute COVID-19 infection has resolved, and can manifest in anyone who has had COVID-19. These symptoms often look like those associated with other chronic medical conditions.</p>



<p>The Administration has mobilized to advance our nation’s understanding of Long COVID and its associated conditions, promote high-quality care for patients, and help individuals access supportive services—especially for those from communities disproportionately affected by the pandemic. The President’s National COVID-19 Preparedness Plan makes clear that we are committed to accelerating these efforts, with additional support and resources from Congress.</p>



<p>Today, President Biden issued a Presidential Memorandum directing the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to coordinate a new effort across the federal government to develop and issue the first-ever interagency national research action plan on Long COVID. The effort will advance progress in prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and provision of services, supports, and interventions for individuals experiencing Long COVID and associated conditions. The Presidential Memorandum also directs HHS to issue a report outlining services and supports across federal agencies to assist people experiencing Long COVID, individuals who are dealing with a COVID-related loss, and people who are experiencing mental health and substance use issues related to the pandemic. This report will specifically address the long-term effects of COVID-19 on high-risk communities and efforts to address disparities in access to services and supports.</p>



<p>Today’s announcement builds on the Administration’s ongoing work to implement the recommendations of the <a href="https://www.minorityhealth.hhs.gov/healthequitytaskforce/">Presidential COVID-19 Health Equity Task Force</a>. It also builds on a number of additional actions the Administration is taking to support the millions of Americans experiencing Long COVID and their families by delivering high-quality care and expanding access to services and supports, as well as actions to advance efforts to detect, prevent, and treat Long COVID.</p>



<p>These actions include:</p>



<p><strong>Delivering high-quality care for individuals experiencing Long COVID: </strong>As a complex condition that can affect multiple organ systems, Long COVID may require care and coordination across multiple medical specialties. The Administration recognizes that the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in new members of the disability community and has had a tremendous impact on people with disabilities. The Administration will continue to center the voices of patients in this work and is advancing efforts to deliver high-quality, high-value care to people experiencing Long COVID—especially communities hardest-hit by COVID-19. In collaboration with patients, payers, and providers across the care continuum, the Administration will accelerate and disseminate clinical support and best practices to promote coordinated, integrated care models and expand access to high-quality care in communities across the country.</p>



<ul><li>Launching Centers of Excellence and promoting evidence-based care models: Through the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), the President’s Fiscal Year 2023 (FY23) budget will invest in a multi-year initiative, beginning with $20 million in FY23, to investigate how health care systems can best organize and deliver care for people with Long COVID, provide telementoring and expert consultation for primary care practices, and advance the development of multispecialty clinics to provide complex care. This work would fund institutions across the country that bring together leading researchers and care providers across the full care continuum – including hospitals, health centers, long-term care services and supports, and other providers – and promote the implementation of new evidence into care, especially for disproportionately affected populations. As information emerges on effective Long COVID treatments and care, AHRQ in partnership with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), and National Institutes of Health (NIH)—in collaboration with clinical leaders, professional societies, and the national academies—will build on existing <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/clinical-care/post-covid-index.html">interim clinical guidance</a> to get providers and patients the care information they need.</li><li>Expanding and strengthening Long COVID clinics: Across the country, 18 Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) facilities have already established Long COVID care programs, consolidating multidisciplinary clinical expertise in locations veterans know and trust. The VA will expand on the success of these programs by establishing additional Long COVID programs and robust referral and follow-up systems across its facilities. These programs, and others established by hospitals and health systems across the country, are serving as a source of rapid learning and long-term research on best practices and new therapies, along with the broader provider, patient, and scientific community. The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health (OASH) will launch the Health+ project to gain insights into the experiences and patient journeys of people living with Long COVID and associated conditions, to help inform high-quality care and contribute to standardized best practices at Long COVID clinics.</li><li>Promoting provider education and clinical support: The Administration will continue to work with providers to advance our recognition and understanding of Long COVID and associated conditions, including by sharing culturally competent information and resources through platforms like the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) Medicare Learning Network and Indian Health Service (IHS) provider education and partnerships with academic institutions. The Administration will also launch targeted clinician and medical coder education on the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/icd/icd10cm.htm">ICD-10-CM</a> code (U09.9) effective last year to support diagnosis, billing, and tracking of Long COVID. To further support equitable access to high-quality care in communities hard-hit by the pandemic, the Administration, through the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), will continue to build sustainable telementoring programs and networks in rural and medically underserved communities. HHS will additionally convene experts across the country to provide recommendations to our nation’s providers on best practices in the identification and management of the mental and behavioral health disorders associated with Long COVID.  </li><li>Bolstering health insurance coverage for Long COVID care: The Administration is working to make Long COVID care as accessible as possible. CMS has clarified that, under the American Rescue Plan (ARP) requirement that state Medicaid and Children&#8217;s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) programs cover treatments for COVID-19, states must also cover treatments and therapies for Long COVID. Additionally, the essential health benefits (EHB) provided by the Affordable Care Act (ACA) generally provide coverage for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19, including Long COVID, though coverage and cost-sharing details vary by plan. CMS has also expanded Medicare coverage for pulmonary rehabilitation services for Long COVID care beginning in the <a href="https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/calendar-year-cy-2022-medicare-physician-fee-schedule-final-rule">2022 Physician Fee Schedule</a>. Moving forward, the Administration will continue to assess opportunities to enhance access to care for Long COVID and its associated symptoms through Medicare, Medicaid, insurance marketplace coverage, and other options. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) will also increase awareness of Long COVID among Federal Employee Health Benefit (FEHB) Program carriers—serving over 8.2 million federal employees, retirees, and their families—and call on them to closely monitor care for individuals with Long COVID. OPM will additionally enhance enrollee education on plans’ coverage of the assessment and treatment of Long COVID and associated symptoms such as respiratory illness and chronic fatigue.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Making services and supports available for individuals experiencing Long COVID:</strong> The Administration continues to work to understand Long COVID and its impact across populations, including how it interacts with other medical and physical conditions. Individuals with Long COVID may need help doing things they did by themselves in the past, or may need accommodations in their daily activities based on changes in their abilities<a>. </a>In addition to the Long COVID guidance <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/26/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-marks-anniversary-of-americans-with-disabilities-act-and-announces-resources-to-support-individuals-with-long-covid/">package</a> released during the 31st anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), the Administration is raising awareness of Long COVID as a potential cause of disability, and strengthening services and supports available for individuals experiencing Long COVID.</p>



<ul><li>Raising awareness of Long COVID as a potential cause of disability: To protect individuals with Long COVID from discrimination, HHS and the Department of Justice (DOJ) have released <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-providers/civil-rights-covid19/guidance-long-covid-disability/index.html">guidance</a> explaining that some individuals with Long COVID may have a disability under civil rights laws, including the ADA, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act. The Department of Education (ED) also released a <a href="https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/ocr-factsheet-504-20210726.pdf">resource</a> to support children, students, educators, schools, service providers, and families—providing information about Long COVID as a disability and about schools’ and public agencies’ responsibilities for the provision of services and reasonable modifications to children and students for whom Long COVID is a cause of a disability. The Administration for Community Living (ACL) and the HHS Office for Civil Rights (OCR) are continuing to disseminate resources to help people with Long COVID understand if they have a disability, educate people on their rights, and to inform organizations of their obligations.</li><li>Translating research into inclusive disability policy: Through the Social Security Administration’s close collaboration with research agencies and other entities, the Administration will continue to clarify and update policy guidance as the science develops to support inclusive disability policy and claims adjudication processes through the Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Insurance (SSI) programs for individuals experiencing Long COVID. This includes building on its <a href="https://secure.ssa.gov/apps10/reference.nsf/links/04162021020344PM">Emergency Message on Evaluating Cases with COVID-19</a> and continuing to be responsive to findings from the medical and scientific communities about the types of evidence that can help establish impairments and identify functional limitations linked to Long COVID, when appropriate. Additionally, ACL and the Department of Labor (DOL) continue to elevate experiences of individuals with disability due to Long COVID, including on return-to-work.</li><li>Connecting people with the resources they need: The Administration will help connect people with Long COVID to information, resources, and service and support options. This includes incorporating multilingual information and support into the <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/dcs/ContactUs/Form">CDC-INFO call center</a>, <a href="https://acl.gov/DIAL">Disability Information and Access Line (DIAL)</a>, and call centers run by CMS—which together receive over 3 million calls each month—and providing Long COVID-specific trainings for customer service representatives. Through ACL’s DIAL and <a href="https://eldercare.acl.gov/Public/Index.aspx">Eldercare Locator</a>, the Administration will also continue to connect older adults and individuals with disabilities to critical local services, such as transportation to receive care. IHS will additionally train business office and benefit administrator staff to assist Tribal communities in navigating Long COVID. SAMHSA will additionally collaborate with stakeholders to advance our understanding of the mental health effects of COVID-19 and promote high-quality mental and behavioral health care services for those who need it.</li><li>Strengthening support for workers experiencing Long COVID: The <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/wysk/what-you-should-know-about-covid-19-and-ada-rehabilitation-act-and-other-eeo-laws#N">Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</a> (EEOC) and DOL recently released guidance on access to equitable employment opportunities for people experiencing the impact of COVID-19 and the symptoms of Long COVID. To protect workers experiencing Long COVID, DOL, in coordination with the EEOC, will continue supporting enforcement of the ADA, and other federal disability related nondiscrimination requirements for all workers. DOL’s <a href="https://askjan.org">Job Accommodation Network</a> (JAN) also helps individuals with Long COVID remain in or return to their jobs. This includes both resources to empower workers to request and negotiate accommodations, as well as resources for employers on effective accommodation strategies. Additionally, through the legal networks funded by ACL, the Administration will continue to support legal assistance related to Long COVID to older adults and people with disabilities.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Advancing the nation’s understanding of Long COVID:</strong>&nbsp;Robust data and information are essential to our fight against the COVID-19 pandemic and its long-term effects. The Administration will support and accelerate research to understand, prevent, diagnose, treat, advance non-discrimination for, and otherwise support individuals with Long COVID. This includes efforts to better identify and characterize Long COVID – including with respect to its frequency, severity, duration, and risk factors; account for its impact on hard-hit and high-risk populations; and better understand its symptoms—including anxiety and depression, fatigue, shortness of breath, difficulty concentrating, heart palpitations, disordered sleep, chest and joint pain, and headache. These symptoms may look like those associated with other chronic medical conditions—including dysautonomia, myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), and mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS). In collaboration with patients, academia, providers, and other stakeholders, the Administration will continue to take critical steps to advance our scientific understanding in order to prevent, detect, and treat Long COVID.</p>



<ul><li>Launching the first-ever <em>National Research Action Plan on Long COVID</em>: Today, President Biden issued a Presidential Memorandum directing the Secretary of Health and Human Services to coordinate a new effort across the federal government to develop and issue the first-ever interagency national research action plan on Long COVID. The effort will advance progress in prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and provision of services, supports, and interventions for individuals experiencing Long COVID. This effort, building on the landmark <a href="https://recovercovid.org/">Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery</a> (RECOVER) Initiative and other initiatives across the federal government, will advance our understanding of Long COVID, foster the development of new treatments and care models, and inform services, support, and interventions for individuals experiencing Long COVID.</li><li>Accelerating enrollment into the RECOVER Initiative: Last year, the NIH launched its $1.15 billion RECOVER Initiative to advance our understanding of and ability to predict, treat, and prevent Long COVID. To help catalyze progress, the Administration will accelerate the enrollment of approximately 40,000 individuals with and without Long COVID into RECOVER’s longitudinal observational arm—in addition to advancing RECOVER’s pathobiology studies, EHR studies, and clinical trials. Equity remains at the center of the Administration’s COVID-19 response efforts, and RECOVER will focus on enrolling individuals across all ages, races, ethnicities, and socioeconomic statuses—including pregnant people, individuals with disabilities, and those from the communities hardest hit by the pandemic. RECOVER will also continue to bolster its patient-centered approach, leveraging its National Community Engagement Group—comprised of patient representatives across its pathobiology task forces and executive, steering, and oversight committees—to enable patients to shape research design and execution, listen for community feedback, and learn from patients’ first-hand experience.</li><li>Making further investments to advance Long COVID research and surveillance: Building on the $50 million CDC has already invested, the President’s FY23 budget has requested $25 million to answer key questions on the characteristics, risk factors, underlying mechanisms, and health impacts of Long COVID—through clinician engagement, electronic health data analyses, and grant funding. This includes through the <a href="https://www.covidinspire.org/">Innovative Support for Patients with SARS-CoV-2 Infections Registry (INSPIRE) study</a> by CDC, which will follow nearly 6,000 individuals nationwide for up to 18 months, and other dedicated research in Tribal and other hard-hit, high-risk communities.</li><li>Leveraging the power of federal data: With its robust, national health care databases, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) offers a wealth of information on the risks and burdens of COVID-19. Using data from over 600,000 individuals with COVID-19, the VA will continue advancing its work to assess the different health impacts of COVID-19 over time. This includes building on its already published analyses relying on EHR data on <a href="https://doi.org/10.1681/ASN.2021060734">kidney</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-022-01689-3">cardiovascular</a>, and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj-2021-068993">mental health</a> outcomes in people who have gotten COVID-19, through a national study surveying infected Veterans and uninfected controls about persistent symptoms. Additionally, the Department of Defense (DOD) has launched the Epidemiology, Immunology, and Clinical Characteristics of Emerging Infectious Diseases with Pandemic Potential (EPICC) study of Military Health System beneficiaries to help determine effects of COVID-19 and define clinical strategies to address them. This foundational study will not only support our military medical readiness but also our broader understanding of the disease.</li><li>Identifying workplace interventions that help keep individuals connected: To inform the development of inclusive disability policies and benefits, the DOL is scaling its work to identify early intervention strategies for workers who experience injuries or illnesses, including Long COVID, when working. DOL is expanding beyond its initial pilot study—to Kansas, Kentucky, Minnesota, Ohio, and Vermont—to help workers find alternatives as they decide whether to stay at or return to work following an illness like Long COVID.</li></ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>Today, Prime Minister Scott Morrison of Australia, Prime Minister Boris Johnson of the United Kingdom, and President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. of the United States reviewed progress in implementing the Australia – United Kingdom – United States (AUKUS) partnership. The leaders reaffirmed their commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific, and more broadly to an international system that respects human rights, the rule of law, and the peaceful resolution of disputes free from coercion – a commitment whose importance has only grown in response to Russia’s unprovoked, unjustified, and unlawful invasion of Ukraine.</p>



<p>Implementation of the AUKUS partnership has now begun. It has two related lines of effort.</p>



<ul><li>Submarines. AUKUS will provide Australia with a conventionally armed, nuclear powered submarine capability at the earliest possible date,&nbsp;while upholding the highest non‑proliferation standards.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Advanced capabilities. AUKUS will develop and provide joint&nbsp;advanced military capabilities to promote security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.</li></ul>



<p><strong><u>Senior-Level Meetings</u></strong></p>



<p>Since AUKUS was announced on September 15, 2021, the three countries have held multiple high-level meetings.</p>



<ul><li>Senior Officials Group. On March 10, 2022, National Security Advisors from the three allies met virtually to review AUKUS progress and provide direction to the trilateral partnership going forward.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul><li>Joint Steering Groups. The three countries have held multiple Joint Steering Group meetings for each of the two AUKUS lines of effort, including in-person sessions in Canberra, London, and Washington, D.C.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul><li>Working Groups. Seventeen trilateral working groups have been established (nine relating to conventionally-armed nuclear-powered submarines, and eight relating to other advanced military capabilities); each has met multiple times.</li></ul>



<p><strong><u>Australia’s Future Conventionally-Armed Nuclear-Powered Submarine Capability</u></strong></p>



<p>When AUKUS was announced in September 2021, Prime Minister Morrison, Prime Minister Johnson, and President Joe Biden agreed to determine, by March 2023, the optimal pathway for an Australian conventionally-armed, nuclear-powered submarine capability. AUKUS partners have taken important steps toward implementation.</p>



<ul><li>Information exchange. The Exchange of Naval Nuclear Propulsion Information Agreement (ENNPIA) entered into force on February 8, 2022, enabling AUKUS partners to share naval nuclear propulsion information trilaterally.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul><li>Nuclear stewardship. For several weeks in February, combined teams from Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States visited multiple sites in Australia to baseline its nuclear stewardship, infrastructure, workforce, and industrial capabilities and requirements. On February 28, findings were considered by the Joint Steering Group on submarines. The Joint Steering Group will use this information as it develops the optimal pathway for Australia to acquire nuclear-powered submarines.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul><li>Australia workforce. Initial steps are underway to ensure Australia has a workforce with the necessary skills, training, and qualifications to build, operate, and sustain a conventionally-armed nuclear-powered submarine capability. For example, a cohort of Australian personnel have commenced higher-education and training opportunities in nuclear science and engineering.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul><li>New submarine base. Prime Minister Morrison announced, on March 7, Australia’s plan to establish a future submarine base on the east coast of Australia to support the basing and disposition of future nuclear-powered submarines. This new facility will operate in conjunction with Australia’s existing submarine base in Western Australia.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Nuclear Powered Submarine Construction Yard: The Australian Government is taking initial steps to secure additional land on which to build the Nuclear-Powered Submarine Construction Yard, including land adjacent to the existing Osborne North Shipyard in South Australia.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul><li>Non-proliferation. Since the announcement of AUKUS, our nations have been engaging proactively with the International Atomic Energy Agency on the non-proliferation aspects of our partnership.  Following the initiation of technical consultations with the IAEA, IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi <a href="https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/statements/iaea-director-generals-introductory-statement-to-the-board-of-governors-7-march-2022" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> to the IAEA Board of Governors on March 7 that Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States “are committed to ensuring the highest non-proliferation and safeguards standards are met.” </li></ul>



<p><strong><u>Advanced Capabilities</u></strong></p>



<p>AUKUS partners have made strong progress in the four advanced capabilities that the President and Prime Ministers identified in September 2021, and have recently initiated work in four additional areas. As we mature trilateral lines of effort within these and other critical defense and security capabilities, we will seek to engage allies and close partnersas appropriate.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Undersea capabilities. Through the AUKUS Undersea Robotics Autonomous Systems (AURAS) project, our nations are collaborating on autonomous underwater vehicles, which will be a significant force multiplier for our maritime forces. Initial trials and experimentation of this capability are planned for 2023.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul><li>Quantum technologies. The AUKUS Quantum Arrangement (AQuA) will accelerate investments to deliver generation-after-next quantum capabilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;It will have an initial focus on quantum technologies for positioning, navigation, and timing.&nbsp;&nbsp;Together, we will integrate emerging&nbsp;quantum technologies in trials and experimentation over the next three years.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul><li>Artificial intelligence and autonomy.&nbsp;Trilateral cooperation on artificial intelligence (AI) and autonomy will provide critical enablers for future force capabilities, improving the speed and precision of decision-making processes to maintain a capability edge and defend against AI-enabled threats. Early work is focused on accelerating adoption, and improving the resilience of, autonomous and AI-enabled systems in contested environments.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul><li>Advanced Cyber. In light of the importance of the cyber domain to advanced capabilities, we are focusing our efforts on strengthening cyber capabilities, including protecting critical communications and operations systems.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul><li>Hypersonic and counter-hypersonic capabilities.&nbsp;The AUKUS partners will work together to accelerate development of advanced hypersonic and counter-hypersonic capabilities.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Electronic warfare.&nbsp;&nbsp;The electromagnetic spectrum is increasingly contested.&nbsp;&nbsp;The three countries will work together to share understanding of tools, techniques, and technology to enable our forces to operate in contested and degraded environments.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul><li>Innovation. Our work on innovation aims to accelerate our respective defense innovation enterprises and learn from one another, including ways to more rapidly integrate commercial technologies to solve warfighting needs.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Information sharing. We will expand and accelerate sharing of sensitive information, including as a first priority enabling workstreams that underpin our work on agreed areas of advanced capabilities.</li></ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p class="has-text-align-center">Via Teleconference</p>



<p>5:42 P.M. EDT</p>



<p>MR. MUNOZ:&nbsp; Hi, everybody.&nbsp; Happy Monday.&nbsp; Thank you for joining us on this call about tomorrow’s announcement around the President, Vice President, and former President Obama’s event around the Affordable Care Act.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We will be providing a factsheet very soon that will also be embargoed until 5:00 a.m.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A reminder this call is attributable to “senior administration officials.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>With that, I will kick it to [senior administration official] to discuss tomorrow’s announcement.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Hi, everybody.&nbsp; Thank you for joining us this afternoon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>President Biden and Vice President Harris believe that healthcare is a right, not a privilege.&nbsp; So, I want to discuss today three things: First, a regulation that will be released by the Department of the Treasury tomorrow to strengthen the Affordable Care Act; second, the tremendous progress we’ve made in helping people get affordable, high-quality healthcare; and third, an executive order that the President will sign tomorrow that will direct agencies to continue their efforts in making coverage more affordable and accessible for American families.</p>



<p>So, to start, tomorrow Treasury will release a proposed rule that will help hundreds of thousands more Americans get coverage under the Affordable Care Act.</p>



<p>Under the ACA, people who do not have access to affordable health insurance through their jobs may qualify for financial help to buy coverage under the ACA.</p>



<p>For single people, “affordable” means coverage that costs less than about 10 percent of their income.</p>



<p>But for spouses and kids that are offered coverage through a family member’s job, under current rules, they’re treated as having affordable coverage no matter what the actual cost of that coverage is for them.&nbsp; So that could mean that families would have to pay 25 or 30 percent of income to get coverage through their employer, and they can’t get financial help under the ACA, under today’s rule.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, the rules that Treasury is releasing tomorrow will propose to change that.&nbsp; Under Treasury’s new proposed rules, family members who have to pay more than 10 percent of income for coverage will be able to get financial help under the ACA.</p>



<p>As a result, 200,000 uninsured people are expected to gain coverage, and nearly a million more are expected to see lower premiums every day.</p>



<p>To borrow a phrase, this rule is a big deal.&nbsp; We’re excited about it.&nbsp; And we think it (inaudible) significant administrative action to improve implementation of the ACA that’s been taken since the law was first enacted.</p>



<p>Second, I want to highlight that tomorrow’s rule builds on the remarkable progress that we have already made as an administration in bringing affordable coverage to folks.</p>



<p>Enrollment in coverage through the ACA is at an all-time high, and the uninsured rate is near historic lows.</p>



<p>One of the very first things we did in this administration was open a special enrollment period to get people coverage. &nbsp;President Biden had been in his seat for less than a month when HHS opened the doors to HealthCare.gov to ultimately help about 2 million people get (inaudible).</p>



<p>This winter, we ran the most successful open enrollment period under the ACA ever: 14.5 million people buying an ACA Marketplace plan; another 1 million signed up for coverage through a related program called the “Basic Health Plan” &#8212; a really tremendous open enrollment period that brought millions of people into coverage.</p>



<p>In addition, 19 million people are today covered through the Medicaid expansion, and Medicaid enrollment totals nearly 80 million people.</p>



<p>More people than ever before have the security and peace of mind that comes with affordable health insurance.</p>



<p>And the American Rescue Plan is a major contributor to this success.&nbsp; We’ve made coverage much more affordable for everyone buying through the ACA.&nbsp; And the President was proud to sign that legislation.</p>



<p>This also reflects the tireless work of agencies to expand their outreach and their enrollment assistance, including quadrupling the amount of in-person staff available to provide outreach assistan- &#8212; enrollment assistance in communities across the country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ACA is facilitating the expansion of Medicaid in Missouri and Oklahoma, which brought another half a million people into eligibility for coverage.</p>



<p>In short, this administration has been working since our first hours in office to get more Americans healthcare, and we’re still at it.</p>



<p>We are incredibly proud of what we’re getting done, but there is more to do.&nbsp; And so, tomorrow, the President will also sign an executive order that directs agencies to continue their efforts to strengthen access to affordable, high-quality healthcare.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The executive order will highlight a number of areas:</p>



<ul><li>Making it easier for people to enroll in and keep their coverage.</li><li>Helping people better understand their coverage options so they can pick the one that’s best for them.</li><li>Strengthening and improving the generosity of benefits and improving access to healthcare providers.</li><li>Improving the comprehensiveness of coverage and protecting Americans from low-quality health insurance.</li><li>Continuing to make health coverage more accessible and affordable by expanding eligibility and lowering costs for Americans with ACA, Medicare, or Medicaid coverage.</li><li>Connecting people to healthcare services by improving access to providers and improving linkages between the healthcare system and our communities to help Americans with health-related needs.</li><li>And finally, taking steps to help reduce the burden of medical debt that far too many Americans experience.</li></ul>



<p>And so that’s a sort of a brief summary of the executive order that the President will sign tomorrow.&nbsp; So I think, with that, I’m happy to take questions about this package of announcements.</p>



<p>MR. MUNOZ:&nbsp; Thank you, [senior administration official].&nbsp; And for those that joined a little bit late, we will be sending out an embargoed factsheet soon, and this is attributable to “senior administration officials.”</p>



<p>Please “raise your hand” if you have any question related to tomorrow’s announcement.</p>



<p>First, let’s go to Joyce Frieden at MedPage Today.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, thanks for taking my question.&nbsp; Regarding the Treasury rule, I&#8217;m wondering how much fixing this family glitch is going to cost and how it will be paid for.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Yeah, so I can&#8217;t &#8212; I can&#8217;t speak to that directly.&nbsp; Treasury is in charge of interpreting the provisions of 36B of the Affordable Care Act, which is the part of the law that provides financial assistance to people.&nbsp; 36B tax credits are an entitlement just like anything else in the tax code, and Treasury is interpreting their regulations to propose making this change.</p>



<p>MR. MUNOZ:&nbsp; All right.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s go to Tami at CNN.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you very much for holding this call.&nbsp; Two questions.&nbsp; One is: How quickly do you think that people in the family glitch will be able to get coverage?&nbsp; How long will this take?</p>



<p>And then also, can you be a little bit more specific on what types of things the executive order might result in?&nbsp; What types of changes?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; On the first question, Treasury is proposing that the bona fide interpretation of affordability would take effect beginning January 1st, 2023, so people would be able to get financial assistance through the ACA&nbsp;starting at &#8212; during the next open enrollment period.</p>



<p>And as to the executive order, I think I&#8217;m not in a position tonight to preview more than what I have today.&nbsp; We will be sending out a factsheet that, broadly, the President is directing agencies to do everything in their power to make coverage more affordable and accessible.</p>



<p>MR. MUNOZ:&nbsp; Amy Lotven at Inside Health Policy.</p>



<p>Amy, you’re still muted.&nbsp; All right, we’ll try you later, Amy.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s go to Tom Howell with The Washington Times.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey, thanks for doing the call.&nbsp; I just want to know about the bigger subsidies in the ACA.&nbsp; Does the President plan to address that?&nbsp; I believe they expire at the end of the year, but his Build Back Better Agenda would extend them.&nbsp; Does he plan to pressure lawmakers over that to get that part of the agenda passed?&nbsp; Thanks.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Yeah, I&#8217;m not going to comment on any potential negotiations with Congress.&nbsp; But, as you know, the Build Back Better Act includes significant coverage policy, including extending the financial assistance under the ARP.&nbsp; (Inaudible) policies have widespread support, and we look forward to getting it done.</p>



<p>MR. MUNOZ:&nbsp; All right, let&#8217;s go back to you, Amy.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, yes.&nbsp; Sorry about that.&nbsp; I&#8217;m actually really wondering &#8212; it sounds like the affordability threshold will still apply to the families, but they&#8217;ll only &#8212; that they&#8217;ll be able to access the credit if they&#8217;re over the threshold.&nbsp; I just &#8212; is that right?&nbsp; So, you&#8217;re not fully &#8212; so, the rule doesn’t fully separate the families from the worker?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; So, under the rule, coverage for the family will be &#8212; the affordability of coverage for the family will be affected.&nbsp; So, if coverage for the family as a whole costs more than about 10 percent of household income, then the non-employee family members will be eligible for financial assistance in the marketplace.</p>



<p>MR. MUNOZ:&nbsp; Any more questions?&nbsp; All right, a couple more.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s go to Selena at NPR.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, thank you so much for doing the call.&nbsp; I just have a question about the number of people who might be affected.&nbsp; I was looking at an analysis from KFF on the so-called “family glitch” that estimated 5.1 million people nationally fall into the family glitch.&nbsp; The numbers that you mentioned at the top of the call &#8212; you said 200,000 people are expected to gain coverage, and a million &#8212; or I forget &#8212; I might have missed that number &#8212; would pay a lower cost.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I’m just wondering if you can explain, like, something behind your estimate of who might be impacted here.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Yeah, sure.&nbsp; So there won&#8217;t be any official estimates from the administration coming out tomorrow.&nbsp; But to give you some context on sort of what&#8217;s out there: You&#8217;re right that there are estimates that there were &#8212; that there are about 10 million people who are affected in some way by the family glitch.&nbsp; And so all of those people will have a new option under these proposed rules.</p>



<p>Some of them may choose to stay in the coverage that they’re in today because they find it more convenient to have their whole family in a single health plan.&nbsp; And so, some of the 5 million people who were affected and get this new option will nonetheless choose to stay in the type of coverage that they have.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But others, and the people for whom this is the greatest hardship, will change their current &#8212; you know, whatever they&#8217;re doing right now.&nbsp; So, as a result, about 200,000 uninsured people are expected to gain coverage for the first time because they don&#8217;t &#8212; they have no coverage at all, say because it&#8217;s just too expensive for them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And another of that million people, you know, they switch from the coverage that they have today into more affordable Marketplace coverage.</p>



<p>MR. MUNOZ:&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s go to Brett Samuels with The Hill.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey, thanks for doing this call.&nbsp; I just had a quick question about former President Obama being part of the event tomorrow.&nbsp; I was just hoping you could speak to kind of what role he&#8217;ll play in this event and sort of the significance of having him, you know, at the White House for the signings of these orders.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; I don’t have anything to preview there.&nbsp; I think you’ll hear more from the President about that tomorrow afternoon.</p>



<p>MR. MUNOZ:&nbsp; And, Brett, Jen spoke to this in the briefing today, so there&#8217;s a little bit more detail there.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t think we have any more questions.&nbsp; So, with that, thank you, everybody, for joining.&nbsp; As a reminder. we will provide a factsheet shortly tonight.&nbsp; This and the factsheet are embargoed until 5:00 a.m.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>And if you have any other questions, please reach out to me.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>
