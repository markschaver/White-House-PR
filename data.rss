<p>Today, Speaker Pelosi and Leader Schumer met with Office of Management Budget Acting Director Shalanda Young, National Economic Council Director Brian Deese, and Domestic Policy Council Director Susan Rice to discuss the President’s legislative priorities, including the American Jobs Plan and the American Families Plan. They agreed that Congress must meet the President’s goal of investing in creating a generation of good paying jobs, addressing the climate crisis, and ensuring American workers and businesses can compete globally, while not raising taxes on anyone who makes under $400,000. They underscored the importance of extending the child tax credit, and investing in the care economy, including expanding child care, to help ensure that women can return to the workforce. They discussed the&nbsp;two-track&nbsp;approach, and the importance of a budget resolution to meeting the full range of the President’s priorities.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">State Dining Room</p>



<p>4:55 P.M. EDT<br>&nbsp;<br>ATTORNEY GENERAL GARLAND: Good afternoon, Mr. President. It’s good to be here with you, and with local elected and community leaders, and with representatives of law enforcement.<br>&nbsp;<br>Protecting our communities from violent crime is a top priority for the Department of Justice and one of our most important responsibilities.<br>&nbsp;<br>I&#8217;m glad the President brought us together today to discuss a subject of such importance to the public we serve. As our participants in today&#8217;s roundtable have noted, the increase in violent crime in 2020 and early 2021 is deeply troubling.<br>&nbsp;<br>That is why, last month, the Justice Department launched a comprehensive violent crime reduction strategy. This strategy is built around four principles: setting strategic enforcement priorities; fostering trust with and earning legitimacy in our communities; investing in community-based prevention and intervention programs; and measuring the results of these efforts through a decrease in violent crime, not merely by arrests and convictions, as if they were ends in themselves.<br>&nbsp;<br>Now, we know that the lion&#8217;s share of violent crime reduction work is shouldered by our state, local, Tribal, and territorial law enforcement partners. Core to our strategy is targeted support of the critical work that you will be doing in the weeks and months ahead.<br>&nbsp;<br>Every one of our U.S. attorney&#8217;s offices is working with its local partners to establish an immediate plan to address the spike in violent crime that typically occurs during the summer. And the law enforcement components of the Department are making enhanced resources available to help prevent and disrupt violent crime, and to focus on the most dangerous, most violent offenders.<br>&nbsp;<br>The Department is also strengthening our Project Safe Neighborhoods &#8212; our cornerstone initiative that brings together law enforcement and community stakeholders to develop solutions to pressing violent crime problems.<br>&nbsp;<br>Community-led efforts are vital to preventing violence before it occurs. The Justice Department has available over $1 billion in funding through over a dozen grant programs that can be used to support evidence-based, community violence intervention strategies.<br>&nbsp;<br>And I want to say that&#8217;s what I found particularly useful in our discussion just a few minutes ago &#8212; was the fact that there are such evidence-based programs available. And I&#8217;m hoping that you will get together with us so that we can spread those across the country &#8212; as well, of course, funding your own.<br>&nbsp;<br>A properly functioning criminal justice system is essential to our efforts, as well. The Department has grant funding available to help cities resume court operations and services that were curtailed during the COVID-19 pandemic. That includes funding for technology and equipment for courts to address the backlog of cases and enhance access to justice.<br>&nbsp;<br>We know that an effective violent crime reduction strategy must also address the illegal trafficking of firearms and focus on keeping guns out of the wrong hands. And so the Department is delivering on the promises we made here at the White House in April.<br>&nbsp;<br>On May 7th, we issued a proposed rule to help address the proliferation of ghost guns. On June 7th, we issued a proposed rule to clarify that pistols equipped with certain stabilizing braces are subject to the same statutory restrictions as easily concealable, short-barreled rifles. And on the same day, the Department published model Extreme Risk Protection Order legislation for states to consider as they craft their own laws to reduce gun violence.</p>



<p>We are now taking further steps. First, we will hold gun dealers that break the rules accountable for their actions. Most federally licensed firearms dealers operate legally in selling guns to individuals who have passed background checks. But those dealers that willfully violate the law increase the risk that guns will fall into the wrong hands.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Absent extraordinary circumstances, ATF will initiate proceedings to revoke the licenses of dealers that willfully violate the law by failing to conduct required background checks, falsifying records, failing to respond to trace requests, refusing to permit ATF to conduct inspections, or transferring firearms to persons who are prohibited from owning them.<br>&nbsp;<br>Second, we are seeking funding to increase ATF&#8217;s dealer inspection capacity and improve its effectiveness. ATF has very limited inspection resources. The President&#8217;s Fiscal 2022 Budget requests resources to add inspection positions in every field division. The effectiveness of the enforcement program depends on the ability to identify and focus on those dealers that pose the greatest risk to public safety.<br>&nbsp;<br>Starting today, ATF will make clear to investigators in every field division that, as they prioritize inspections, they must consider the extent to which firearms sold by a dealer are later used in criminal activity.<br>&nbsp;<br>Third, we will improve information sharing with state, local, Tribal, and territorial partners to help bring more intelligence and law enforcement resources to bear &#8212; as well as with the public, to increase our own accountability.<br>&nbsp;<br>Today, ATF has a point of contact in every field division to receive information from mayors, police chiefs, and other local leaders about firearms dealers they believe are acting unlawfully.<br>&nbsp;<br>And starting next month, ATA &#8212; ATF will begin sharing inspection data with the 16 states that license or regulate firearms dealers themselves.<br>&nbsp;<br>Also beginning next month, ATF will publicly post information about inspection frequency and outcomes disaggregated by field division, providing for enhanced transparency and accountability.<br>&nbsp;<br>Fourth, we are launching a concerted effort to crack down on gun traffickers. Yesterday, the Department announced that it will establish five new cross-jurisdictional law enforcement strike forces within the next 30 days. The strike forces will focus on addressing significant firearms trafficking corridors that fuel violence in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, the San Francisco Bay Area, and Washington, D.C., as well as in cities and towns along the way.<br>&nbsp;<br>The Justice Department&#8217;s violent crime reduction strategy and our initiatives to stem the rising tide of illegal &#8212; illegal guns will save lives. But these steps alone will not solve the problem of violent crime. Success depends on all of us joining together: those of you in this room, the many like you across the country who are working to keep their communities safe, and the people of our communities themselves.<br>&nbsp;<br>I would now like to introduce President Biden, who has emphasized the importance of this issue and who has my gratitude for gathering us together today.<br>&nbsp;<br>Thank you.<br>&nbsp;<br>THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, General. Let me &#8212; before I begin, thank the participants in our roundtable today: two mayors &#8212; three mayors, chiefs of police, attorneys general, and community organizers who have been doing significant work in bringing down violent crime in their communities. There is no one &#8212; one answer that fits everything. And it&#8217;s about being engaged and multiple organizations being engaged.<br>&nbsp;<br>So, I want to thank you for the time you spent with us today. And I warned you: I&#8217;m coming back at you again for more information. (Laughter.)<br>&nbsp;<br>And we just met, as a I said, with a bipartisan group of mayors, law enforcement, and community leaders. And we discussed a comprehensive strategy that I&#8217;m releasing today to combat the epidemic of gun violence and other violent crime that we’ve been seeing in our country for far too long, that has spiked since the start of the pandemic over a year ago.<br>&nbsp;<br>Crime has &#8212; historically rises during the summer. And as we emerge from this pandemic with the country opening back up again, the traditional summer&#8217;s &#8212; summer spike may even be more pronounced than it usually would be.<br>&nbsp;<br>For folks at home, here’s what you need to know: I’ve been at this a long time and there are things we know that work that reduce gun violence and violent crime, and things that we don’t know about. But things we know about: Background checks for purchasing a firearm are important; a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines &#8212; no one needs to have a weapon that can fire over 30, 40, 50, even up to 100 rounds unless you think the deer are wearing Kevlar vests or something; community policing and programs that keep neighborhoods safe and keep folks out of trouble.<br>&nbsp;<br>These efforts worked. They saved lives. But over time, these policies were gutted and were woefully underfunded.<br>&nbsp;<br>In our conversation today, we talked about our strategy to supercharge what works while we continue to push the Congress to act on sensible gun violence legislation.<br>&nbsp;<br>First, we discussed cracking down, as you heard from the Attorney General, on rogue gun dealers. We know that if there is a strict enforcement of background checks, then fewer guns get into the hands of criminals. Background checks have thus far kept more than 3 million guns out of the hands of felons &#8212; convicted felons, fugitives, domestic abusers, and others prohibited from being able to purchase a gun. And there are still too many loopholes in that system.<br>&nbsp;<br>And, today, enough rogue gun dealers feel like they can get away with selling guns to people who aren’t legally allowed to own them.<br>&nbsp;<br>And I might add: The Second Amendment, from the day it was passed, limited the type of people who could own a gun and what type of weapon you could own. You couldn’t buy a cannon.<br>&nbsp;<br>Those who say the blood of lib- &#8212; &#8220;the blood of patriots,&#8221; you know, and all the stuff about how we&#8217;re going to have to move against the government. Well, the tree of liberty is not watered with the blood of patriots. What&#8217;s happened is that there have never been &#8212; if you wanted or if you think you need to have weapons to take on the government, you need F-15s and maybe some nuclear weapons.<br>&nbsp;<br>The point is that there has always been the ability to limit &#8212; rationally limit the type of weapon that can be owned and who can own it.<br>&nbsp;<br>The last time we had data on this issue of who is purchasing guns was more than 20 years ago. Five percent of gun dealers &#8212; it turns out, in the study we did &#8212; showed that 90 percent of illegal guns were found at the crime scenes sold by 5 percent of gun dealers. Five percent sold 90 percent of the guns found at crime scenes.<br>&nbsp;<br>And the &#8212; these merchants of death are breaking the law for profit. They&#8217;re selling guns that are killing innocent people. It’s wrong. It’s unacceptable. And as the Attorney General said, we&#8217;re going to crack down on those gun dealers and the violent criminals they knowingly arm.<br>&nbsp;<br>In April, I announced that the Justice Department is going to be issuing an annual report on gun trafficking so we can update that data.<br>&nbsp;<br>Today, the Department is announcing, as I just did, a major crackdown on &#8212; to stem the flow of guns used to commit violent crimes. It’s zero tolerance for gun dealers who willfully violate key existing laws and regulations. Let me repeat: zero tolerance.<br>&nbsp;<br>If you willfully sell a gun to someone who is prohibited from possessing it, if you willfully fail to run a background check, if you willfully falsify a record, if you willfully fail to cooperate with the tracing requests or inspections, my message to you is this: We&#8217;ll find you, and we will seek your license to sell guns. We&#8217;ll make sure you can&#8217;t sell death and mayhem on our streets. It’s an outrage. It has to end, and we&#8217;ll end it. Period.<br>&nbsp;<br>Second, we discussed disrupting illegal gun trafficking. Now, the gun lobby wants you to believe that cities that are the toughest gun &#8212; have the toughest gun laws still have the highest rates of gun violence, as was pointed out by the group we had today in our roundtable. They &#8212; the violence is so &#8212; they argue, &#8220;Why do you need those gun laws if they don’t work in cities that have tough laws?&#8221; Don’t believe it.<br>&nbsp;<br>Here&#8217;s the truth: Today’s conversation with Mayor Scott of Baltimore, for example, echoed what we know to be the case, and you hear it from mayors across the country. Mayors have the power to help shape and enforce the laws in their cities, but they can’t control the laws in neighboring cities and states, even though the gun legally bought there is &#8212; often ends up in their streets.<br>&nbsp;<br>Mayor Scott says that 80 percent of the guns in Baltimore were acquired outside the city &#8212; outside the city. There’s little he can do about that, so we have to act. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>As part of our strategy, the Justice Department is creating five new strike forces to crack down on illegal gun trafficking in the corridors supplying weapons to cities like New York; Chicago; Los Angeles; Washington, D.C.; and the Bay Area. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>With these strike forces, local and federal law enforcement and prosecutors are going to be able to better coordinate the prosecution of illegal gun trafficking across city and state lines, so illegal guns sold from the back door of a gun shop in Virginia don’t end up at a murder scene in Baltimore. And if they do, then local and federal law enforcement can better coordinate to trace illegal gun sales back to the shady gun dealer and hold them accountable. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Police Chief Murray of the Baltimore [sic] &#8212; excuse me, Police Chief Merritt [sic] &#8212; Police Chief Murphy Paul of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, talked about how he’s coordinating more closely with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms; the ATF; and the Federal Bureau of Investigation &#8212; the FBI &#8212; to help take on criminal organizations committing violent crimes in the city.<br>&nbsp;<br>This kind of coordination is essential to keeping the weapons of war out of the hands of dangerous criminals, fugitives, and gangs, as well as organized crime.<br>&nbsp;<br>Third, we discussed historic funding &#8212; we discussed historic funding for states, cities, and counties, and Tribes for law enforcement and crime prevention. You know, they&#8217;ve not only had to fight this pandemic, they&#8217;ve also had to deal with economic crisis that has decimated their budgets &#8212; forced them to cut essential services, including law enforcement and social services.<br>&nbsp;<br>And amid the COVID-19 pandemic, they&#8217;ve had to deal with a second public health crisis: gun violence. The American Rescue Plan, which we passed in the first 100 days of my administration, is providing much-needed, historic relief to bring back those law enforcement jobs and social service jobs. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Much of this relief has already arrived. The rest is on its way. And we&#8217;re now providing more guidance on how they can use the $350 billion nationally that the American Rescue Plan has available to help reduce crime and address the root causes. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>For example, cities experiencing an increase in gun violence were able to use the American Rescue Plan dollars to hire police officers needed for community policing and to pay their overtime. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Mayors will also be able to buy crime-fighting technologies, like gunshot detection systems, to better see and stop gun violence in their communities. &nbsp;They can use the funding to scale up wraparound services for the residents as well, including substance abuse and mental health services that we know will make a difference in prevention of crime. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Here&#8217;s another example that reminds me of the old saying my mom used to use. She’d say, “An idle mind is the devil&#8217;s workshop.” Well, school&#8217;s out for the summer. Teenagers are in tough neighborhoods, no &#8212; who are in tough neighborhoods &#8212; no jobs, more trouble. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>We know summer job training &#8212; summer jobs, training, and recreation for young people work. They help make sure young people pick up a paycheck instead of a pistol. One study found a Boston summer jobs program for youth reduction reduced violent crimes by 35 percent in Boston.<br>&nbsp;<br>Another study found that a program that offers high school students in Chicago a good summer job and an adult mentor and behavioral therapy led to a 45 percent drop in violence.<br>&nbsp;<br>We can invest in more of these programs with the American Rescue Plan. And here’s another thing states, cities, counties, and Tribes can do with that funding: When someone finishes their time in prison, they can&#8217;t just give them &#8212; we can’t just continue to give them 25 bucks and a bus ticket. They end up right back where they started and got them in trouble in the first place &#8212; or no option for being able to provide for access to public housing or for schools or for &#8212; for mentors to help them find their way, and the stuff that prevents recidivism and helps them integrate in a society. That&#8217;s changing with guidance we’re issuing today.<br>&nbsp;<br>The American Rescue Plan funding can help formerly incarcerated people get skills training, apprenticeships, and work experience so they can gain stability and security and a chance for a better life, rather than going back to exactly what they left. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Attorney General Greenwald of New Jersey and Mayor Daniel- &#8212; and Mayor Daniella Levine Cava of Miami-Dade talked about their efforts to lift up those kinds of communit&#8211; their &#8212; the kinds of community programs that reduce gun violence, keep communities safe, and make real, positive difference in people&#8217;s lives.<br>&nbsp;<br>And for folks at home, the American Rescue Plan, which is a once-in-a-generation investment to reduce violence in America, is available. I&#8217;m proud of it. It means more police officers, more nurses, more counselors, more social workers, more community violence interrupters to help resolve issues before they escalate into crimes.<br>&nbsp;<br>It means we go after the people who flood our streets with guns and the bad actors who decide to use them to further terrorize the communities. &nbsp;It means saving lives. And Congress should in no way take away this funding. It’s already been appropriated. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>In fact, a few weeks ago, the bipartisan United States Conference of Mayors, the National League of Cities, National Association of Counties &#8212; they all came out forcefully against efforts to reclaim American Rescue Plan funds that have already been allocated to the state, cities, and counties, and Tribes. &nbsp;This is not a time to turn our backs on law enforcement or our communities. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Fourth, we discussed the need to support community violence intervention. &nbsp;These are local programs that utilize trusted messengers and community members and leaders to work directly with people who are most likely to commit gun crimes or become victims of gun crimes. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>We know who they are. They intervene before it&#8217;s too late &#8212; these &#8212; these interrupters &#8212; turn down the temperature, halt the cycle of retaliation, connect people to social services. &nbsp;And it works. Community violence intervention programs have shown a reduction in violence of up to 60 percent in many places. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>We heard from two community leaders that do this work. Eddie, thank you for coming from Chicago to &#8212; you&#8217;re really &#8212; quite frankly, it was impressive &#8212; your presentation. &nbsp;And &#8212; and DeVone Boggan from Richmond, California. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Eddie was formerly incarcerated for gun homicide, and DeVone lost his brother to gun violence. And Eddie worked as a violence interrupter. &nbsp;Now he runs a program that provides high-risk men with cognitive behavioral &#8212; cognitive behavioral therapy to help them react to the impulses by slowing down rather than following through on the violence. &nbsp;It puts them in &#8212; he &#8212; puts them in paid jobs to change their trajectory. &nbsp;The program has reduced sh- &#8212; has reduced shootings by 40 percent.<br>&nbsp;<br>DeVone runs a program across California and six other states that enroll high-risk individuals in peace fellowships, complete with intensive mentoring and social services. It’s saving lives. In Sacramento, for example, 91 percent of participants stayed away from gun violence.<br>&nbsp;<br>States and cities should invest the American Rescue Plan funds in those kinds of anti-violent crime programs. And today, I’m announcing that the White House will be working with 15 jurisdictions that are doing exactly that &#8212; from Baltimore to Baton Rouge, and Memphis to Minneapolis &#8212; to build up their community violence intervention programs, starting this summer.<br>&nbsp;<br>And Mayor Steve Allender of Rapid City, South Dakota &#8212; a Republican and a former chief of police himself &#8212; joined us today and will be a part of this effort to help disrupt cycles of crime and violence in his community and nearby Tribal communities.<br>&nbsp;<br>We need more mayors to follow and I&#8217;m going to be pushing to keep &#8212; pushing for more of these proven programs, which are part of the American Jobs Plan and my budget.<br>&nbsp;<br>Fifth, and I’ll close with this: We talked about the lives we lost &#8212; have already been lost and the lives that we can save. We talked about how much pain and loss so many people have experienced and so many people have now accepted as their fate here in America. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>We have an opportunity to come together now &#8212; as Democrats and Republicans, as fellow Americans &#8212; to fulfill the first responsibility of government and our democracy: to keep each other safe. Enough.<br>&nbsp;<br>That means Congress passing sensible gun prevention, violence prevention initiatives is warra- &#8212; is &#8212; makes sense: background checks, ban on assault weapons, repeal of the liability shield for gun manufacturers.<br>&nbsp;<br>It means the Senate reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act &#8212; my proudest legislative accomplishment &#8212; to close the so-called &#8220;boyfriend loophole&#8221; &#8212; its &#8220;boyfriend and stalking loophole&#8221; &#8212; to keep guns out of the hands of abusers. We added the provision saying, &#8220;If you have a stay-away order &#8212; you are stalking someone and you&#8217;re told that has to stop &#8212; you can&#8217;t own a weapon.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;<br>Every single month, an average of 57 women are shot and killed by an intimate partner. We can help stop that.<br>&nbsp;<br>It means confirming my outstanding nominee for &#8212; to lead the AFT &#8212; excuse me, the ATF: David Chipman. It&#8217;s been without a leader for a while. The top job has been un- &#8212; unconfirmed for much too long. A career and distinguished ATF official for 25 years, David is eminently qualified for the job that we desperately need to fill.<br>&nbsp;<br>As Vice President, I pushed hard to lift the freeze on gun violence research at the C- &#8212; the Center for Disease Control, the CDC. Guess what? Why should they not be able to study gun violence and what causes it? But there&#8217;s been a block on it. I want to unfreeze that.<br>&nbsp;<br>As President, my budget doubles funding for the gun violence research at the CDC and the National Institutes of Health &#8212; the NIH &#8212; to study gun violence as a public health threat that it is.<br>&nbsp;<br>And while we keep pushing there, Vice President Harris and I also &#8212; and our entire administration are continuing to be &#8212; will continue taking action where we can. Let&#8217;s stop the proliferation of ghost guns, as we announced back in April with the Attorney General.<br>&nbsp;<br>We need to support the development of smart gun technologies. This doesn’t affect responsible gun owners or Second Amendment rights. It helps keep guns out of the hands of people who shouldn’t have them in the first place, from a child who accidentally picks up a &#8212; picks it up, to a burglar or violent criminal trying to steal it and use it.<br>&nbsp;<br>And we need to keep building on the gun violence and crime-prevention strategy we&#8217;re laying out today.<br>&nbsp;<br>Folks, this shouldn’t be a red or blue issue; it’s an American issue. We’re not changing the Constitution; we&#8217;re enforcing it &#8212; being reasonable. We’re taking on the bad actors doing bad and dangerous things to our communities and to our country.<br>&nbsp;<br>Talk to most responsible gun owners and hunters. They’ll tell you there’s no possible justification for having 100 rounds in a magazine of a gun. Like I’ve said before: What do you think, the deer are wearing Kevlar vests?<br>&nbsp;<br>Responsible gun owners will tell you that there are too many people today who are able to buy a gun but shouldn’t be able to buy a gun.<br>&nbsp;<br>And these kinds of reasonable reforms have overwhelming support from the American people, including gun owners.<br>&nbsp;<br>The bottom line is this: Let&#8217;s show the world and show ourselves that democracy works and that we can come together as one nation. We can do this and save lives.<br>&nbsp;<br>So, thank you. God bless you all. And may God protect our troops.<br>&nbsp;<br>And again, I thank you all for participating. But the bad news for you all is, I&#8217;m coming back. I need your continued help. So, thank you very, very much.<br>&nbsp;<br>And, General, thank you. Appreciate it.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp; Mr. President, are you still holding out hope that Congress can pass another assault weapons ban?<br>&nbsp;<br>THE PRESIDENT: I never give up hope.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp; How do you feel about the bipartisan infrastructure deal that&#8217;s been released?<br>&nbsp;<br>THE PRESIDENT: I&#8217;ll tell you that when I get the final numbers tonight.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp; Mr. President, what do you feel is the most effective thing that government can do to change the mindset of those who feel compelled to pull the triggers of these guns?<br>&nbsp;<br>THE PRESIDENT: By being engaged in a whole range of programs. We talked today &#8212; everything from mental health programs to engaging people early on and letting them know there is other options. Making sure that when a child is young, they have access to a real education, and they get started off on the right foot.<br>&nbsp;<br>Making sure that when someone gets out of prison, they&#8217;re not denied public housing, they don&#8217;t have to go back under the bridge where they were living before &#8212; that they&#8217;re able to get help for healthcare, et cetera, and reengaging them in the neighborhood, giving them some hope, some opportunity. And in the meantime, making sure that those folks who are taking advantage of them by taking advantage of their &#8212; their situation are, in fact, held accountable.<br>&nbsp;<br>Thank you all so much.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp; Once you take care of the voting rights bill, do you think it&#8217;s time to reform the filibuster?<br>&nbsp;<br>THE PRESIDENT: I think it&#8217;s time to pass the voting rights bill.<br>&nbsp;<br>5:24 P.M. EDT</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">James S. Brady Press Briefing Room</p>



<p>1:23 P.M. EDT</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: Hi, everyone. Okay, just a couple of items for you at the top. President Biden believes that the surge in gun violence and violent crime that has affected communities across the country over the last year and a half is unacceptable. That&#8217;s why his administration is moving decisively to act with a whole-of-government approach.&nbsp;<br><br>Today, the Biden-Harris administration is announcing a comprehensive strategy to combat violent crime and gun violence that targets the crime itself, implements preventative measures that are proven to reduce violent crime, and attacks root causes, including by addressing the flow of firearms used to commit crimes.<br><br>Combined, this plan will stem the flow of firearms used to commit violence, including by holding rogue firearm dealers accountable for violating federal laws; support local law enforcement with federal tools and resources to help address violent crime; invest in evidence-based community violence interventions; expand summer programming, employment opportunities, and other services and support for teenagers and young adults; and help formerly incarcerated individuals successfully reenter their communities.<br><br>One of the key elements of this strategy is helping state and local governments fight gun violence and violent crime in their communities through the historic funding levels in the American Rescue Plan.<br><br>Today&#8217;s strategy builds on that by providing further guidance for states and cities to expand their ability to improve public safety in their communities. And we&#8217;ve already seen examples of what is happening around the country. In Philadelphia, Mayor Kenney is using funding from ARP to address gun violence, reform and improve the police department, and invest in violent interruption programs.<br><br>In Albuquerque, Mayor Keller plans to spend $3 million to expand the city&#8217;s gunshot detection system, and millions more to recruit police officers and refurbish station houses.<br><br>In Akron, Ohio, Mayor Horrigan has proposed $20 million to reduce community and youth violence through employment training and opportunities, as well as recreation assets.<br><br>I&#8217;d also note, today &#8212; and obviously the President will speak to all of this later this afternoon &#8212; today, the Vice President will hold a listening session with leading civil rights and voting rights groups from across the country following the Senate vote on the For the People Act just yesterday.<br><br>The meeting builds on the Vice President&#8217;s work to bring together a national coalition on voting rights to promote voter registration and engagement &#8212; engagement among Americans across the country &#8212; from Greenville, South Carolina, to Atlanta, Georgia &#8212; to protect our fundamental right to vote.<br><br>She will drive the message that the fight is not over and that the President and the administration remain committed to ensuring that all Americans have access to the ballot.<br><br>Finally &#8212; I do have one more thing &#8212; tomorrow, the President will travel to Raleigh, North Carolina &#8212; some of you may be on that trip &#8212; as our administration continues to work to continue encouraging vaccinations across the country, ensuring every American knows just how to ensure it is easy to get vaccinated.<br><br>While he&#8217;s there, he will highlight the importance of getting vaccinated and kick off a community canvassing event at the Green Road Park Community Center in Raleigh.<br><br>He will also tour a mobile vaccination unit and meet with frontline workers and grassroots volunteers who are the boots on the ground working to get people in their communities vaccinated.<br><br>Alex, why don&#8217;t you kick us off?<br><br>Q &nbsp;Thanks, Jen. First off, the Vice President&#8217;s office just announced that she will be visiting the border Friday. What can you tell us about the visit? And you have, in the past, defended the decision not to visit the border by anyone, really, in the &#8212; by President Biden or Vice President Harris. So what’s behind the, sort of, change of course?&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI: Sure. First, I think many of you may have seen it, but just to reiterate the specific details &#8212; the Vice President will travel to El Paso, Texas, on Friday. She will be accompanied by Department of Homeland Security Secretary Ali Mayorkas.<br><br>Earlier this year, as you all know, the President asked the Vice President to oversee our diplomatic efforts to address the root causes of migration from El Salvador to Guatemala and Honduras. And, as a part of this work, she recently traveled to Guatemala and Mexico last month to have those discussions. And this trip to the border on Friday will be a part of this effort.<br><br>I will note that I&#8217;ve also said here, from this podium &#8212; and she has also said &#8212; that when it was the right time, she may go to visit the border. And so, this trip on Friday, which is being done in coordination with the Department of Homeland Security &#8212; Secretary Mayorkas is, of course, joining her on this trip, you know, and the planning and timing of it was done in coordination with them &#8212; is &#8212; is part of the coordinated effort between her office, her work, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Health and Human Services to continue to address the root causes and work in coordination to get the situation under control.<br><br>Q&nbsp; Sure. And then on voting rights: The President’s statement yesterday said he&#8217;ll have more to say on this next week.<br><br>MS. PSAKI: Mm-hmm.<br><br>Q&nbsp; Can you give us a sense of what we should expect from the President on voting rights? And you also have said that there are other avenues for protecting voting rights. What do those look like?<br><br>Then I&#8217;m going to take another stab at this &#8212; I know you&#8217;ve been asked this five different ways, but &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI: Okay.<br><br>Q&nbsp; &#8212; does the President believe that the filibuster is &#8212; defending the filibuster is worth more. and more important than protecting voting rights?<br><br>MS. PSAKI: Well, first, let me say &#8212; as the Vice President said yesterday and I&#8217;ll just reiterate &#8212; the fight to improve and expand access to voting is far from over. And the President, as he noted in his statement yesterday and as you just touched on, will be speaking to this next week. And this is a continuation of his efforts to use the bully pulpit to elevate this issue, as he did just last week when he marked Juneteenth, and also as he did in Tulsa, Oklahoma, just a few weeks before that.<br><br>So I expect you &#8212; we’ll have more to preview as we get closer. But I can tell you that what you should expect to hear from him is that there are many ways to work across the country &#8212; with activists, with states, with legislators &#8212; using every lever at our disposal to expand access, improve access to voting for people across the country.<br><br>He&#8217;ll talk about some of the ways that he wants to continue to do that. He&#8217;ll also reiterate his view that it&#8217;s a fundamental right and that people across the country should be able to exercise that to decide who they want to be their mayor, who they want to be their congressman, who they want to be their President. And everybody who supports democracy, who supports equality, who supports justice should be supporting improvements to our voting rights laws.<br><br>Q&nbsp; And one more last one on this conversation around crime.<br><br>MS. PSAKI: Mm-hmm.<br><br>Q&nbsp; How should the American people measure success for President Biden on crime? Should they be looking for a reduction in crime in their localities? Or, I mean, what exactly is he aiming for in announcing these new policies today?<br><br>MS. PSAKI: Well, that certainly is the goal, of course. But I would say, Alex, that what the President has watched closely is that there has been, of course, an increase in violent crime &#8212; gun violence, specifically, in a lot of communities &#8212; over the last 18 months.<br><br>He&#8217;s obviously taken a number of steps over the past couple of months to work to address that. This is a continuation of that in his view. And part of that is empowering local police communities and making sure that local communities have the funding they need to &#8212; to support efforts by the local police. It also means taking steps to address the prevalence of gun violence across the country.<br><br>So, of course, his objective is to take steps &#8212; steps he can do, as the President of the United States, using the tools he has at his disposal &#8212; to empower local communities, get them the resources they need, and ensure we&#8217;re putting laws in place that reduce gun violence.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp; Thanks, Jen. Can you tell us a little bit more about what the Vice President will be doing at the border? Is she visiting a detention center or a facility for migrant children? And how much access will the press have to whatever sites she tours while she’s there?<br><br>MS. PSAKI: They&#8217;re all great questions. Obviously, they just made this announcement. I&#8217;m sure they will have more details to share with you. I just don&#8217;t have any more to share with you at this particular moment on what she&#8217;ll be doing specifically there.<br><br>Q&nbsp; Okay. And then can you tell us a little bit more about this decision for the U.S. to seize website domains used by Iranian state TV? What led to that decision and why now?<br><br>MS. PSAKI: It&#8217;s a Department of Justice decision and action, so I would point you to them.<br><br>Q&nbsp; Is there any concern that this could hamper negotiations over Iran&#8217;s nuclear program?<br><br>MS. PSAKI: We are still at the point in those discussions &#8212; we just finished the sixth round. Obviously, all of the negotiators are back in their capitals, having discussions, as is appropriate.<br><br>We see advantage to us in moving toward a diplomatic solution. We hope others who have seats at the table do as well. But, again, this was an action by the Department of Justice, not &#8212; not coordinated with other aspects of our negotiations.<br><br>Q&nbsp; And then what can you tell us about the talks that took place on the Hill yesterday over the bipartisan infrastructure proposal? Were those fruitful discussions? And where does that go from here? Is the President going to be hosting any of those senators here at the White House in the coming days?<br><br>MS. PSAKI: If we continue to make progress in these discussions, then the President looks forward to welcoming members to the White House before the end of the week. We&#8217;ll see.<br><br>There were a couple rounds &#8212; there were two rounds of discussions yesterday. And I know you&#8217;re all aware of this &#8212; or many of you who cover this closely &#8212; but there was one in the afternoon; there was another one last night. Additional progress was made last night.<br><br>This afternoon, Steve Ricchetti, Louisa Terrell, Brian Deese are all back up on the Hill right about now having continued discussions about the path forward. That&#8217;s one track where we are moving forward on these bipartisan negotiations. And we assess, as we conclude each round, what the next step should be.<br><br>So, again, if we make progress and if we assess that &#8212; that it is the appropriate time to bring these officials &#8212; these elected officials to the White House, the President looks forward to doing that.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp; Thank you, Jen. So, about today&#8217;s announcement: Why is the Vice President visiting the border this week when, earlier this month, she dismissed a trip like that, saying it would be a “grand gesture”?<br><br>MS. PSAKI: She also said in an interview with NBC that she would be open to going to the border if it was an appropriate time. She said that after she said that, so that&#8217;s important context as well.<br><br>Q&nbsp; Okay. And, important context: I&#8217;ve got the NBC interview right here. She was talking about how she hasn&#8217;t been to the border; she hasn&#8217;t been to Europe either. So, does she think that these two things are the same?<br><br>MS. PSAKI: And, again, Peter, I think she also said in the same interview that she would be open to going to the border at an appropriate time. And what I&#8217;m conveying to you is that, while, as a part of her assignment, she has, of course, hosted a number of bilateral engagements &#8212; she&#8217;s visited the Northern Triangle; she&#8217;s taken &#8212; made a number of announcements about how to address root causes &#8212; that she&#8217;s going &#8212; was going to assess, with the Department of Homeland Security and with the administration, when it was the appropriate time to go.<br><br>And I will note that we&#8217;re at this point in part because we&#8217;ve made a great deal of progress. And if you look just to a couple of months ago, when 6,000 children were in Border Patrol facilities, we&#8217;re now at the point where there&#8217;s far less than 1,000.<br><br>If you look to just a couple of months ago, when there were children who were waiting in Border Patrol facilities for more than 100 hours &#8212; and they were certainly overcrowded &#8212; now it&#8217;s less than 30 hours.<br><br>In April, there were 22,000 kids in HHS facilities, and now that number is 14,000.<br><br>Is there still more work to do? &nbsp;Absolutely. That&#8217;s the purview of Secretary Mayorkas. But it&#8217;s important every component of our government is coordinated.<br><br>Q&nbsp; Was it important for the White House to have her seen at the border before former President Trump has a trip there next week?<br><br>MS. PSAKI: We made an assessment within our government about when it was an appropriate time for her to go to the border.<br><br>Q&nbsp; And then just one about the crime today. You mentioned expanding &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI: The crime prevention roll out.<br><br>Q&nbsp; &#8212; crime prevention, yes. (Laughter.) Not the crime. But there is a lot of crime in big cities. How do you reduce &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI: Much of it caused by gun violence, would you agree?<br><br>Q&nbsp; Yes. So, how do you reduce gun violence by expanding employment opportunities, including summer jobs for young people?<br><br>MS. PSAKI: Well, first, there&#8217;s several components of this proposal. One of them is an initial set of actions on gun violence &#8212; or an additional set, I should say, of steps on gun violence, which the President feels are important to get guns off the streets, make sure they are not in the hands of people illegally, many of whom are playing a role in violent crime across the country. That&#8217;s part of his objective.<br><br>He also wants to provide &#8212; as we&#8217;ve seen has been effective in communities across the country &#8212; incentives and alternatives for young people in communities where that has shown to be an effective step.<br><br>Q&nbsp; So is the thought there basically that somebody &#8212; some criminal who has been committing crimes with limited interruption or interference from police for the last couple of weeks or months is going to stop this easy life of crime if they have a summer job?<br><br>MS. PSAKI: Well, I think the President believes that we shouldn&#8217;t &#8212; we shouldn&#8217;t allow access to guns to those criminals who are currently illegally buying them from some dealers across the country, and part of his announcement is taking steps to do exactly that.<br><br>But part of his announcement is also ensuring there’s specific guidance to communities across the country to ensure that they have funding to get more community police around the country, something that was supported by the American <s>Jobs</s> [Rescue] Plan, that was support- &#8212; that was voted into law by Democrats just a couple of months ago. Some might say that the other party was for defunding the police; I&#8217;ll let others say that, but that&#8217;s a piece.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp; Would you concede there is a political calculation to having the Vice President visit the border before Donald Trump goes and with a drumbeat from Republicans who have counted the days that she has not visited the border? Isn&#8217;t there a political decision in the timing of this?<br><br>MS. PSAKI: Well, Kelly, I would say that we have no way to predict what President &#8212; former President Trump will say when he ha- &#8212; when he goes to the border. We can only guess. But I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;re &#8212; our view is that the Vice President making a trip to the border with the Secretary of Homeland Security to assess and take a look at progress that&#8217;s been made is going to prevent or change what the former President of the United States says when he goes to the border in a couple of days.<br><br>Oh, go ahead. Did you have another question? Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp; Senators, including Senator Tester, are saying that they believe they&#8217;re at really the, kind of, razor&#8217;s edge &#8212; a moment with deciding to payfors &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI: Yeah.<br><br>Q&nbsp; &#8212; for infrastructure: Can they go forward? Do you feel that there is the possibility of some kind of a development within the next 24 hours? Would you agree with that sense of the timing? And is there anything new that the White House has offered for paying for these infrastructure programs that we have not learned of from you before?<br><br>MS. PSAKI: Well, there&#8217;s no question &#8212; as you know, it&#8217;s much easier to negotiate with Congress when they&#8217;re in session. So we&#8217;re certainly hoping to make progress over the next couple of days. I&#8217;m not going to put a 24 or 48 &#8212; there&#8217;s a couple more days in the week, and we&#8217;re hopeful to make progress.<br><br>If we see progress continue to be made between our discussions with our members of our senior team and members, then we look forward to welcoming Democrats and Republicans here to the White House to meet with the President.<br><br>In terms of what we would offer: The President has offered a range of ways to pay for these proposals. And we&#8217;ve also taken &#8212; we had so many options of how to pay for these proposals we&#8217;ve even taken some of our own proposals off the table, including ensuring that individual &#8212; individuals pay a higher rate for this specific negotiation&nbsp;and also raising the corporate rate for this specific negotiation, even though we&#8217;re keeping it on the table for later on &#8212; to be very clear.&nbsp;<br><br>But the bottom line &#8212; it&#8217;s pretty clear and simple to the President. The choice for him on the payfors is: Are you going to ask Americans who are just trying to go to work &#8212; just trying to drive their cars to work, drop their kids off at school &#8212; to pay more through the &#8212; through a gas tax? Or should &#8212; should the wealthiest Americans pay what they owe in taxes? To him, that&#8217;s a pretty clear, no-brainer choice. That&#8217;s part of the discussion though.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp; Thanks. Back to the President&#8217;s crime prevention announcement today: You&#8217;ve noted that violent crime has been up over the last 18 months and several years. So what specifically prompted the President to come out and make this announcement today?<br><br>MS. PSAKI: Well, there&#8217;s a policy process that has been underway for the last couple of weeks and months even. We&#8217;ve had a series of announcements, as you know, over the past several months, on gun violence prevention. Obviously, there was funding in the American Rescue Plan to support keeping cops on the street. And there were several components that were just prepared to be announced.<br><br>Q&nbsp; And you&#8217;ve made clear you&#8217;re tackling this, you know, as a gun issue. The President has urged Congress to take action on this. We have seen very little movement on the Hill. It&#8217;s been years since we&#8217;ve seen sweeping gun reforms out of Washington.<br><br>What is the President&#8217;s message then to Americans who are concerned about rising crime in their communities? In order to achieve real progress, do they have to wait for Congress to act?<br><br>MS. PSAKI: Well, the President would certainly like to see Congress act on universal background checks, on an assault weapons ban, a number of the pieces of legislation that are currently &#8212; I shouldn&#8217;t say &#8220;working their way through Congress,&#8221; but are currently alive in Congress.<br><br>But he&#8217;s not going to wait. And his message to the American people is: He&#8217;s going to take steps that he has the power to take as President to reduce gun violence, to put in place measures that will reduce the likelihood of criminals having access to guns on the streets. There are authorities you have &#8212; any President has. And he&#8217;s going to take steps to do that, even as he pushes for legislation to move forward.<br><br>Q&nbsp; So, beyond the announcements today, he is preparing or considering additional steps that could tackle some of these issues?<br><br>MS. PSAKI: Well, I think we&#8217;re going to focus on the announcements he&#8217;s making today, a lot of which are on gun violence and gun violence prevention measures. I don&#8217;t have anything beyond that to preview, but there are some significant steps he&#8217;s certainly announcing this afternoon.<br><br>Q&nbsp; And just one more question on how the funding for all of this works. You know, you&#8217;re allowing state and local governments to reallocate some of the COVID-19 relief funds to hire more police officers, invest in other areas to combat this rise in crime. But when Republicans pitched that idea to try and pay for some &#8212; an infrastructure plan, the White House said that money was already allocated. So what&#8217;s &#8212; what&#8217;s the difference here?<br><br>MS. PSAKI: Well, the money was always allocated in state and local authority &#8212; to state and local governments. One of the authorities they could always have taken was to ensure there were more cops on the beat, more police in place, and that&#8217;s something we have always said was a part of the plan and the proposal. I don&#8217;t know why Republicans oppose that or why that would have prompted them to vote against the package.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp; Just to follow up on Mary&#8217;s first question, public safety can be a potent political issue. To what degree, if any, has the politics played a role in the decision to really try and get out in front of things today?<br><br>MS. PSAKI: Well, the President has been very consistent in his views over the course of decades. He has never been for defunding the police. He has always been a supporter of ensuring there are &#8212; that local community policing is funded and adequately supported by the federal government. He&#8217;s also been a longtime advocate, for decades, and leader on addressing gun violence. So this is actually a continuity of his leadership on these issues over the course of decades.<br><br>Now, he has taken steps since President on each of these issues as well, including supporting funding &#8212; proposing funding in his own budget for community policing &#8212; and this is just an opportunity to put additional meat on the bones.<br><br>Q&nbsp; And then, two more quick ones. You&#8217;ve answered this before, but just to make sure I understand red lines in the elusive search for payfors that are amenable to everybody: User fees on electric vehicles, is that in the same category as indexing the gas tax from your guys&#8217; perspective in these negotiations?<br><br>MS. PSAKI: Yes, we are not for a Ford F-150 tax. I&#8217;m not sure why others are.<br><br>Q&nbsp; Good framing. And then, quickly, given the tempo of some of the Taliban offensives that we&#8217;ve seen in Afghanistan, are there contingency plans at work right now to either move troops out faster or, perhaps more importantly, embassy officials &#8212; folks that we plan &#8212; the U.S. plans to keep on the ground if they advance much quicker than perhaps was initially thought?<br><br>MS. PSAKI: Well, first, I would say that our Department of Defense is overseeing an orderly withdrawal of our troops from Afghanistan and doing that at a pace that, in their view, will keep &#8212; ensure their safety and ensure we are doing it in a way that&#8217;s effective and in a coordinated manner with the government.<br><br>I will say that while, in general, we are seeing elevated attacks on ANDSF and Afghan government versus a year ago, we have not seen an increase in attacks on our military presence since February 2020. And we also assess that, had we not begun to draw down, violence would have increased against us as well after May 1st, because that was what the Taliban was clearly conveying. So the status quo, in our view, was not an option.<br><br>In terms of personnel and others on the ground, that&#8217;s certainly something that our State Department and our team takes very seriously and assesses whether there is a need to take any additional action. And I would certainly refer &#8212; defer to them on any additional preview they&#8217;d do on that front.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp; Thank you, Jen. We understand that the administration plans to replace the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac&#8217;s federal regulator after the Supreme Court ruling that has now made it easier for the President to install his preferred overseer. Do you have a comment on that?<br><br>MS. PSAKI: That&#8217;s correct, given the Supreme Court ruling this morning. But I don&#8217;t have any timeline for you on when that nomination will be made.<br><br>Q&nbsp; Is there &#8212; is there &#8212; are there any preferred candidates?<br><br>MS. PSAKI: I don&#8217;t have any candidates to preview. When we&#8217;re ready to announce one, we will announce one.<br><br>Q&nbsp; Okay. And any comment on the &#8212; on Russia firing warning shots and dropping bombs to chase a British warship out of waters Moscow now claims that &#8212; in the Black Sea that they claim belongs to Russia?<br><br>MS. PSAKI: I would point you to the British. We don&#8217;t have any more comment on it from here.<br><br>Q&nbsp; And one question on voting rights. We&#8217;ve been kind of talking to a lot of voting rights and civil rights activists who are saying that the President isn&#8217;t just simply doing enough on the issue and is betraying Black voters who actually helped him &#8212; get him &#8212; get into the office by not doing absolutely everything he can. And he&#8217;s instead spending his time negotiating infrastructure with Republicans. How would you respond to that criticism?<br><br>MS. PSAKI: Who was saying that?<br><br>Q&nbsp; A lot of civil rights activists and voting activists.<br><br>MS. PSAKI: Like who?<br><br>Q&nbsp; We&#8217;ve spoken to several groups and outfits. I mean, I can reach out to you with names after the briefing. And &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI: Sure. That sounds good.<br><br>Okay. Go ahead. (Laughter.)<br><br>Q&nbsp; Thanks, Jen. A number of lawmakers have asked the administration to extend the federal moratorium on evictions which expires at the end of the month. Is that something the administration is considering? And why or why not?<br><br>MS. PSAKI: Sure. Well, let me first say that that would be a decision &#8212; the decision to extend the eviction moratorium will be made by the CDC, based on public health conditions. And we certainly wouldn&#8217;t get ahead of their assessment.<br><br>As you know, the moratorium &#8212; the eviction moratorium expires on June 30th &#8212; 30th. Hence, I think, your question. It was always intended to be temporary. And the President remains focused on ensuring that Americans who are struggling, through no fault of their own, have an off-ramp once it ends. Hence, we&#8217;ve also worked to take additional steps to ensure people are getting the support they need to stay in their homes, whether they are renters or homeowners.<br><br>But we&#8217;d certainly defer to the CDC on their decision and their timeline.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp; Thanks, Jen. The Miami Police Chief, Art Acevedo, expressed concern, disappointment that his association wasn&#8217;t invited to the discussion. He &#8212; his association represents dozens of the largest city police forces: the Major Cities Chiefs Association. I just wanted to ask why the group wasn&#8217;t invited, considering the role that they would likely be part of it.<br><br>MS. PSAKI: Well, I think, as we were putting together the roundtable that the President is taking part in today, we tried to have a diverse group of individuals representing a range of interests from across the country who have all played an active and vital role in addressing crime and crime prevention across the country.<br><br>It is not meant to diminish anyone, including the individual you mentioned. And I&#8217;m sure we will be closely engaged with them and others who are not a part of this roundtable.<br><br>Q&nbsp; One more question on &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI: Sure.<br><br>Q&nbsp; &#8212; the crime and gun prevention effort. This effort involves redirecting some of the relief aid (inaudible). It gives wide latitude for spending that money in certain areas. But the Biden administration largely opposed redirecting relief funds for infrastructure projects. There were some limited exceptions: water and sewer. But why was it not okay for infrastructure or limited for infrastructure, but it is more okay for this area? This &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI: I think this is similar to the question Mary just asked. I mean, it has always been the case that ensuring funding was used by state and local authorities to keep cops on the beat was always a part of what was allowed in the parameters of the spending. And that is something that a number of communities, as I outlined at the beginning, did take the steps to do. So this is just giving additional guidance on how to use the funds.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp; Thanks, Jen. On the meeting later today between Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi and White House officials: What is the White House&#8217;s message to them going to be with regard to the infrastructure talks? Are you going to insist on continuing going down the bipartisan route? Or is this going to be a decision point where they may sort of kick the tires and go ahead with reconciliation on that?<br><br>MS. PSAKI: Well, we&#8217;ve always seen this &#8212; or seen this for some time, I should say &#8212; not always &#8212; as a two-track strategy. Right? So there are different discussions and negotiations happening today.<br><br>One track &#8212; the American Jobs Plan, or big components of it &#8212; is a part of the infrastructure negotiations that we&#8217;re discussing &#8212; Steve Ricchetti, Louisa Terrell, Brian Deese &#8212; right now with members who are part of that bipartisan discussion.<br><br>Later tonight is a discussion that will also include Shalanda Young, also includes Susan Rice and others. That&#8217;s a part &#8212; a discussion, in part, about the budget reconciliation process &#8212; the second track. And that track will include the American Families Plan and components that are not a part of the negotiation.<br><br>So we&#8217;ve been saying two tracks. Today is an example of two tracks actually moving forward at one time in one day.<br><br>Q&nbsp; Which track is moving more smoothly right now? (Laughter.)<br><br>MS. PSAKI: They&#8217;re both moving at a rapid pace. You know, they&#8217;re both moving. We &#8212; we know that, one, we&#8217;re at a later stage, obviously, in the bipartisan negotiations. You all know that. And obviously, we want to make progress over the next couple of days.<br><br>We&#8217;re in an earlier stage of the budget reconciliation progress &#8212; process. That&#8217;s because that&#8217;s how that process works. But it&#8217;s important to keep both tracks going.<br><br>Q&nbsp; And then just one more for you on &#8212; I just wanted to follow up if you had any answer from yesterday what &#8212; about whether President Biden discussed interest rates with the Fed Chairman Powell and other financial regulators.<br><br>MS. PSAKI: I just &#8212; the interest rates, as you know, are the &#8212; under the purview of the Federal Reserve. I gave you an asses- &#8212; an overview of what was discussed in the meeting and don&#8217;t have anything else to add to that.<br><br>Q&nbsp; Afghanistan?<br><br>Q&nbsp; On the For the &#8212; thanks, Jen.<br><br>MS. PSAKI: Yeah.<br><br>Q&nbsp; On the For the People Act that &#8212; you said this week that it would be the fight of this presidency. The President said last night the fight is not over. Now that the Senate has put itself in the record, how do you see this fight playing out in the 117th Congress on the floor? Is it going to be won on the floor before the end of this Congress?<br><br>MS. PSAKI: We&#8217;ll see. I don&#8217;t think we can assess that quite yet. And I think what&#8217;s important to know is that the President is going to keep fighting for federal legislation. The Vice President is going to keep fighting for federal legislation. Leader Schumer and others have also made clear, I think, on the floor last night: They&#8217;re going to continue to look for paths forward.<br><br>We will &#8212; we will see what that looks like, but we&#8217;re &#8212; we&#8217;re still assessing that in the coming days.<br><br>What the President will also talk about though, next week, is &#8212; not that fight &#8212; but also what we can do in states around the country, what we can do through a range of the authorities that the federal government has. Because for all of these, our objective is to make it easier to vote, make it more accessible to vote. And there&#8217;s a lot of ways to do that, even as we&#8217;re continuing to fight for federal legislation.<br><br>Q&nbsp; I want to ask you another question about the border. You said that a lot of &#8212; a great deal of progress has been made.<br><br>MS. PSAKI: Mm-hmm.<br><br>Q&nbsp; Border Patrol statistics show something close to 900,000 interactions or encounters on the southwest border so far this fiscal year, 170,000-odd per month the last three months. Is that where you&#8217;re measuring progress? You spoke of the unaccompanied minors, but what about the influx of people? The Vice President was tasked with the diplomatic efforts there. Has that been successful? And how are you measuring that success?<br><br>MS. PSAKI: Well, first, I think the Vice President has made a number of announcements about coordinated efforts with countries in the region, in the Northern Triangle, through her leadership in that area. And we&#8217;ll &#8212; we&#8217;ll be able to assess over time what it looks like in terms of migration numbers.<br><br>I was pointing to the fact that, a couple of months ago, we were looking at very overcrowded Border Patrol facilities, we were looking at kids waiting for far too long in those facilities, and there being a timeline of getting kids to vetted family members that wasn&#8217;t up to our &#8212; up to our bar. There has certainly been progress made in that regard, but the work is ongoing.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp; Thanks, Jen. My colleagues are reporting that the U.S. intelligence community concluded last week that the government of Afghanistan could collapse as soon as six months after the American withdrawal is completed. What is your reaction to that? And do you think that would also factor into speeding up an evacuation, especially for Afghans who helped the U.S.?<br><br>MS. PSAKI: Well, let me first say, on SIVs &#8212; on Special Immigrant Visas &#8212; and these are individuals who have played an incredibly courageous role in helping the United States at various times over the course of our recent history: We are processing and getting people out at a record pace. We are working with Congress right now to streamline some of the requirements that slow this process down, and we&#8217;re doing the kind of extensive planning for potential evacuation should that become necessary.<br><br>So we are continuing to evaluate what our options are there, continuing to take steps forward. And certainly, we want to take every step we can take from the federal government to treat all of these courageous individuals as they deserve.<br><br>Q&nbsp; Is there a reaction on that intelligence community&#8217;s assessment at all &#8212; that the government could collapse within six months of the U.S. withdrawing?<br><br>MS. PSAKI: I don&#8217;t have any more assessment beyond the intelligence community.<br><br>Q&nbsp; Follow-up on the Afghanistan, please?<br><br>MS. PSAKI: Mm-hmm. Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp; Yes. As you know, President Ghani will be here on Friday.<br><br>MS. PSAKI: Mm-hmm.<br><br>Q&nbsp; While President Ghani and Dr. Abdullah Abdullah are visiting Washington, D.C., Taliban has still continued their attack all over Afghanistan. Do you think that President Biden is committed to a stronger, long-term support for Afghan people, especially Afghan military? Because Afghan people have high expectations from this trip &#8212; the President of Afghanistan.<br><br>MS. PSAKI: I wouldn&#8217;t say I don&#8217;t anticipate &#8212; the timeline for withdrawal is not going to change by September, which, of course, is overseen by our Department of Defense. A part of their discussion on Friday will certainly be the President reiterating his commitment to work with the government of Afghanistan to continue to provide humanitarian support, over-the-horizon security &#8212; you know, work that &#8212; that he committed to when he made this announcement. And I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;ll discuss this during their meeting on Friday.<br><br>Go ahead. Francesca, go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp; I&#8217;ve got a couple. I&#8217;ve got a couple for you.<br><br>MS. PSAKI: Sure.<br><br>Q&nbsp; Firstly, on the &#8212; on the Vice President&#8217;s trip to&nbsp;the border, why does the White House view this as the appropriate time for that visit?<br><br>MS. PSAKI: Well, I think, Francesca, the decision on the timing was made in coordination with the Department of Homeland Security. As we&#8217;ve said from the beginning, we didn&#8217;t want to have anyone visit at a time where it&#8217;d be disruptive to efforts and progress being made on the ground, but they made that assessment. And she had said, just a few weeks ago, that she&#8217;d be open to going to the border if &#8212; at the appropriate time.<br><br>Q&nbsp; And earlier today the White House announced that 15 jurisdictions would participate in its community violence intervention program.<br><br>MS. PSAKI: Mm-hmm.<br><br>Q&nbsp; Do you anticipate that list expanding to include other cities &#8212; like Kansas City, which has grappled with gun violence and has been engaged with the White House on this issue?<br><br>MS. PSAKI: That&#8217;s a great question. And you&#8217;re right that it was 15 cities that we announced &#8212; or 15 jurisdictions that we announced this morning. Those jurisdictions stepped &#8212; or we will announce &#8212; I guess, I should say, &#8220;later this afternoon&#8221; &#8212; they stepped forward to join the collaborative because they&#8217;re committed to using these strategies as a tool to reducing the scourge of gun violence.<br><br>They have also designated a portion of their American Rescue Plan state and local funding &#8212; or another source of public funding &#8212; to support CVI efforts and have committed to city leadership and infrastructure, such as leading local efforts through an Office of Neighborhood Safety. We&#8217;re calling for more cities to follow these jurisdictions&#8217; lead, and, certainly, we&#8217;d welcome engagement and a desire to follow those trends as well.<br><br>Q&nbsp; And lastly, is the White House worried that its non-infrastructure agenda is being stymied to the point that it could have a negative impact on Democrats competing in next year&#8217;s elections?<br><br>MS. PSAKI: You mean our budget reconciliation process we&#8217;re meeting about today?<br><br>Q&nbsp; No, I&#8217;m talking about the $15 minimum wage, voting rights. There&#8217;s ongoing disputes over childcare, other elements of the Families Plan, immigration reform. There&#8217;s &#8212; there&#8217;s a number of different things.<br><br>MS. PSAKI: I will say that the American Families Plan is a part of the budget reconciliation discussion and process. That&#8217;s an historic investment in childcare, and community college, and universal pre-K &#8212; a number of areas that are a huge, huge priority to the President, as well as many Democrats.<br><br>I think, ultimately, I&#8217;m not going to assess, 18 months from the midterm elections, what that looks like. But the most important topics on the Ameri- &#8212; minds of the American people are COVID and the economy, and we&#8217;re certainly moving forward on all fronts.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp; Thank you, Jen. First, a question on Afghanistan. The Afghani leaders who are coming to meet with the President on Friday are going to want specifics about U.S. support to secure the governance and human rights gains that have been fraught for the last 20 years there. Can the President guarantee that those gains won&#8217;t be lost?<br><br>MS. PSAKI: The President can guarantee that we will continue to support humanitarian assistance; support for progress &#8212; human rights progress that&#8217;s been made on the ground; and a range of investments the United States have made that we&#8217;ve already committed to continuing.<br><br>Q&nbsp; Has he determined how much money that is needed?<br><br>MS. PSAKI: Over the course of time? That&#8217;s going to be done on kind of a year-by-year assessment.<br><br>Q&nbsp; In the next year then, is there any sort of estimate there?<br><br>MS. PSAKI: Beyond our budget? I don&#8217;t have anything more beyond our budget.<br><br>Q&nbsp; On crime, I just wanted to ask quickly if you could give us any details about who helped shape the President&#8217;s crime plan. You know, was there was input from various activists, perhaps from the Floyd family?<br><br>MS. PSAKI: It was certainly driven, of course, by the President of the United States, who oversees all of our policies here, and driven by policy leaders within the government &#8212; from Susan Rice, Cedric Richmond, a number &#8212; there&#8217;s obviously economic components &#8212; Gene Sperling, Brian Deese. And they certainly do assess and engage with a range of activists and leaders around the country, but I don&#8217;t have any more detail to read out for you.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp; Jen, just one more.<br><br>MS. PSAKI: Oh, yeah. Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp; Just really quickly: On the Vice President, there&#8217;s a lot of discussion today about the Vice President&#8217;s role in immigration, but I was wondering if you could outline any of her involvement, in the last few moments, on infrastructure &#8212; a different topic that is, sort of, in the closing stage right now. Has her portfolio there, sort of, gotten lower as other things have risen, or can you just give us the, sort of, state of play?<br><br>MS. PSAKI: Sure. Well, I would say that the negotiations are primarily being led at a staff level by Louisa Terrell, Steve Ricchetti, and Brian Deese. And again, if we&#8217;re at the point where we&#8217;ve made enough progress, the President will invite them here, and I&#8217;m sure the Vice President would be a part of that. But they&#8217;ve really been led at the staff level over the past couple of days. And if there&#8217;s calls that warrant the Vice President or the President making, certainly they would make them. But that&#8217;s really what the action &#8212; where the action has been over the last several days.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp; Thanks. Just to follow on my colleague&#8217;s question about the eviction moratorium &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI: Sure.<br><br>Q&nbsp; &#8212; there&#8217;s some reporting that there&#8217;s a one-month extension that&#8217;s going to come out pretty soon. I know you said you don&#8217;t want to ahead of the CDC, but the CDC is punting all of our questions back to you. So is there anything you &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI: That&#8217;s confusing. Sorry.<br><br>Q&nbsp; It is. (Laughter.) Is there anything you can tell us about whether a one-month extension is to be expected?<br><br>MS. PSAKI: I don&#8217;t have anything I can confirm for you from here today.<br><br>Q&nbsp; Okay. And then, on guns: All advocates are saying there should be gun czar. Is that something that&#8217;s still being considered by the White House: one person that&#8217;s responsible and spearheading this work on gun reform?<br><br>MS. PSAKI: The President is responsible.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp; Yes. Thank you, Jen. For some months, lawmakers of both parties have been asking the administration to prohibit polysilicon from coming into the country from China because it&#8217;s being made in Xinjiang. It&#8217;s a key material, as you may know, for solar panels.<br><br>So, is there some concern that prohibiting that from China could hurt the President&#8217;s net zero goals? Or what are you looking at doing, in regards to this, from the human rights perspective?<br><br>MS. PSAKI: Well, first, let me say that, in Cornwall, just two weeks ago, G7 countries committed to ensuring that global supply chains are free from the use of forced labor. And they&#8217;re &#8212; which was a significant statement and agreement among G7 countries.<br><br>And so, as a part of that, you can expect that the United States will continue to hold those who engage in forced labor accountable and that we will continue to remove goods made from local forced labor from our supply chains.<br><br>As you also know, and I think this is the root of your question, we also remain committed to making progress internationally &#8212; glo- &#8212; domestically and internationally on addressing the climate crisis. But we think we can certainly do both.<br><br>I don&#8217;t have anything yet to announce as it relates to specific products &#8212; or substances, I should say &#8212; that are planned, but we&#8217;ll see if we have more on that in the coming days.<br><br>Q&nbsp; We have to gather for the event.<br><br>MS. PSAKI: Oh, okay. Great. We have to gather for the event.<br><br>Thanks, everyone, so much. Have a great day. See you tomorrow.<br><br>2:01 P.M. EDT</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Washington National Cathedral<br>Washington, D.C.</p>



<p>11:21 A.M. EDT<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:  Reverend Hollerith, distinguished clergy, members of the Congress and our military, distinguished guests, Jeanne, Virginia, John, Mary, and Andrew, and the Warner family: It&#8217;s a great honor to be invited to speak a few moments about John.<br><br>A few days after John’s passing, I visited Arlington National Cemetery on Memorial Day &#8212; a sacred place on solemn day when we undertake the fundamental act of remembrance.  And amid the moments that I was there and the monuments of stone, we remembered each marker represented a precious life.  We remembered the heroes of the greatest generation the world has ever known and that bears a noble name: the United States of America.<br><br>The only nation founded on an idea that we&#8217;re all created equal, &#8220;endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable Rights,&#8221; including, &#8220;Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.&#8221;  And a democracy that is the very soul of our nation and that must be defended at all costs &#8212; a soul embodied by all those patriots buried in Arlington and the fields across the world, and by our dear friend, John Warner.<br><br>Like many here, I had the privilege of serving with John for three decades in the United States Senate.  While we represented different political parties, I can say without hesitation John was a man of conscience, character, and honor, with a deep commitment to God and country. <br><br>Enlisted in the Navy &#8212; the United States Navy at age 17 to fight in World War Two.  A few years later, enlisted in the Marine Corps to fight in Korea.<br><br>Eventually named Secretary of the Navy by President Nixon.  Then elected to the United States Senate, where he became a towering and respected voice on foreign policy, national security, and defense.  The second-longest-serving senator from Virginia and the longest-serving Republican. <br><br>A member of the Greatest Generation.  And as that, he understood that democracy is more than a form of government; democracy is a way of being.  He understood it begins and grows in an open heart, and with the willingness to work across the aisle and come together in common cause.<br><br>And that empathy &#8212; empathy &#8212; is the fuel of democracy, the willingness to see each other as opponents, not as enemies.  Above all, to see each other as fellow Americans even when we disagree.  From John&#8217;s perspective, especially when we disagree.<br><br>That’s how John forged consensus and made sure our system worked and delivered for the people.<br><br>I saw it time and again on issues of war and peace.  John opposing torture and ending gun violence.  On protecting the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary.<br><br>John’s decisions were always guided by his values, by his convictions, and never by personal political consequences.  And was always guided by his obligations to all of those he represented, even those who did not vote for him.<br><br>Every senator wears the pride of his or her state on their sleeve, but John’s love for the people of Virginia was something special.  And they loved him back and kept reelecting him because they knew John understood the job of senator was bigger than himself.  It was about more than just John. <br><br>And as we say in the Senate, “Excuse me a point of personal privilege”: When John endorsed me for President last year, it carried an extra meaning for me.  The senators and congresspersons here will understand this.  It wasn’t merely that a prominent Republican endorsed me; when John endorsed me, it gave me confidence.  Not about winning &#8212; about being able to do the job.  John gave me confidence.<br><br>You know, in the battle for the soul of America today, John Warner is a reminder of what we can do when we come together as one nation.<br><br>While we’ve never made real the full promise of America to all Americans, John’s life is a reminder that every generation &#8212; every generation has opened the door of opportunity a little bit wider.  Every one.<br><br>And the mission handed down generation to generation is the work of perfecting the union &#8212; a mission he now leaves us with a way forward. <br><br>That’s the power of remembrance.  It lies not just in our history, but in our hope for the future.  Not just in our solace, but in our strength.<br><br>It lies in our hearts to continue the work of democracy &#8212; the work of our time, of all time, and the work of John’s whole life. <br><br>To John’s Senate staff: Thank you for your service and for all you’ll do to carry on John’s legacy.<br><br>And to his family &#8212; Jeanne, Virginia, John, Mary, Andrew &#8212; Jill [and] I know it hurts to remember.  Sometimes it just hurts to remember.  But it’s also the way to heal &#8212; to remember.<br><br>The Bible teaches, “Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted.”  While comfort can be a long time in coming, I promise you it will come.  It will give you purpose in his memory, in his love for you, and his love for this country.<br><br>Virginia, I know you’ll be reciting your father’s favorite poem &#8212; a sort of an anthem.<br><br>Here’s another one that describes him so well, in my view, that means a great deal to my family and to me.  It’s called “American Anthem”:<br><br><em>&#8220;The work and prayers of centuries have brought us to this day,</em><br><em>What shall be our legacy?  What will our children say?</em><br><em>Let me know in my heart when my days are through,</em><br><em>America, America, I gave my best to you&#8221;</em><br><br>John Warner gave his best to America and, to the best of my knowledge, to everybody he had a relationship with. <br><br>May God bless him.  He was a good man, a great American.  It was an honor to have known him and worked with him.<br><br>11:30 A.M. EDT</p>

And we&#8217;ll open it up to a few questions.&nbsp;<br><br>Again, as a reminder, all the contents of this call are on background, attributable to &#8220;senior administration officials&#8221; and will be embargoed until 5:00 a.m. Eastern tomorrow.<br><br>So, with that, I am going to kick it over to [senior administration official] to get things started.<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Thank you so much, [senior administration official].&nbsp; And thanks, everyone, for giving us a little of your time this evening.<br><br>You will have heard President Biden, again and again, call the nation&#8217;s attention to what he has said is a public health epidemic: gun violence.&nbsp; He has talked about the gun violence that makes national headlines, but also the gun violence that doesn&#8217;t make national headlines and tears apart families every day in this country.&nbsp; He&#8217;s talked about not just mass shootings, but also community violence, suicide by firearms, domestic violence by firearms.<br><br>We know that the secondary consequences of the pandemic and the proliferation of illegal guns have led to increased violence in the past year and a half, including a 30 percent increase in homicides and 8 percent increase in gun assaults in large cities in 2020.<br><br>In the first quarter of 2021, homicides are 24 percent higher than the first quarter of <s>2022</s> [2020].&nbsp; Since day one of his administration, President Biden has taken action to address this increase in gun violence and other violent crime, giving cities and states the resources they need to make their communities safer.<br><br>In April, you saw the President announce a package of executive actions to reduce gun violence while he continued to call for Congress to act.&nbsp; He announced that the Justice Department was going to stem the flow of ghost guns into our communities, that they were going to better regulate firearms with arm braces, that the federal government was going to make changes to 26 federal programs to invest more funding in community violence intervention.&nbsp; And the President nominated David Chipman to be the leader that we need at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.<br><br>You saw the President, in his American Jobs Plan, call on Congress to invest $5 billion in community violence interventions, which are programs we know work to reduce community violence in our cities.&nbsp; And you saw him put forward a fiscal year 2022 budget request that had increases &#8212; increased funding for ATF to do its job.<br><br>Building on all of these actions, tomorrow the President is announcing his comprehensive strategy to prevent and respond to gun crime and ensure public safety.&nbsp; He will be meeting with state and local leaders, a collection of mayors, of police chiefs,&nbsp; eight state attorney generals, and community violence intervention experts to continue the conversation he has been having with local leaders across the country regarding what they are seeing on the ground, how federal &#8212; and how the federal government can help them make their community safer.&nbsp; And the President will deliver remarks to announce his comprehensive strategy to prevent and respond to gun crime and ensure public safety.&nbsp;<br><br>This plan has five parts.&nbsp; I will talk about &#8212; I will provide a brief overview of a few of them, and then turn it over to my colleague to cover the rest.<br><br>The first section of this comprehensive strategy will stem the flow of firearms used to commit violence.&nbsp; You &#8212; as I mentioned, you&#8217;ve already heard the President talk about the administration&#8217;s efforts to stem the flow of ghost guns into our communities.&nbsp;<br><br>Tomorrow, the Biden administration will announce additional action.&nbsp; The Justice Department is announcing a new policy to underscore zero tolerance for willful violations of the law by federally licensed firearms dealers that put public safety at risk.&nbsp; Absent extraordinary circumstances that would need to be justified to the director, ATF will seek to revoke the licenses of dealers that first time that they violate federal law by willfully taking &#8212; undertaking a number of actions, including transferring a firearm to a prohibited person and failing to respond to an ATF tracing request.&nbsp; This will be a historic policy that will make sure that we hold gun dealers across the country who are contributing to the supply of crime guns accountable.<br><br>The President will also be announcing policies to maximize the efficacy of ATF resources to crack down on rogue gun dealers violating our laws.&nbsp; As I said, the President&#8217;s fiscal year 2022 budget request would allow ATF to add inspectors in every field division around the country.<br><br>In the meantime, the administration is going to be taking action to make sure that we&#8217;re using ATF resources to the best of our capacity.&nbsp; This includes designating, for mayors, a specific point of contact in every field division, so mayors, police chiefs, or other local leaders can report concerns about particular dealer compliance with the law.&nbsp; It also means giving the 16 states that have their own gun dealer licensing system their &#8212; the federal inspection data so those states can then determine whether to take their own steps to shut down dealers that fail to live up to their obligations under state law.<br><br>Additionally, you saw, today, the Justice Department announced that it is launching five multi-jurisdictional firearms trafficking strike forces.&nbsp; These strike forces are focused on addressing significant firearm trafficking corridors that have diverted guns to some of our major cities.&nbsp; They recognize that we need multi-jurisdictional coordination to reduce the flow of firearms into cities and that cities can pass laws within their own jurisdictions, but need support to stem the flow of &#8212; from other cities and states.<br><br>The second category of action is providing law enforcement the tools and resources needed to tackle gun violence.&nbsp; As part of the Justice Department&#8217;s comprehensive strategy for reducing violent crime, the Justice Department is committed to supporting law enforcement in local communities and addressing gun violence.<br><br>Last month, we saw the Justice Department announce that it is providing support for local law enforcement from the FBI, ATF, DEA, and the United States Marshal Services.&nbsp;<br><br>Tomorrow, the Treasury Department will be building on this by highlighting that communities experiencing a surge in gun violence as a result of the pandemic may use the American Rescue Plan’s $350 billion in state and local funding for purposes such as hiring law enforcement officials to advance community policing strategies, giving police departments and cities funding for additional enforcement efforts to reduce gun violence exacerbated by the pandemic, including prosecuting gun traffickers, and investing in technology and equipment to allow law enforcement to more efficiently and effectively respond to the rise in gun violence resulting from the pandemic.<br><br>I want to pause here for a moment because this is a historic amount of funding that the President is making available to cities and states through the American Rescue Plan to invest in a range of tools to reduce gun violence in their communities and make their communities safer.<br><br>To talk about the next section of the strategy, I will turn it over to my colleague, [senior administration official].<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Thanks, [senior administration official].&nbsp; Hey, everybody.&nbsp; Good to be with you.<br><br>The next part of the strategy here &#8212; the third element &#8211;is about investing in community violence intervention programs.&nbsp; You have heard us talk about this before, these &#8212; and the President specifically talked about this before repeatedly.&nbsp; Community violence intervention programs are a huge part of the President&#8217;s gun violence reduction strategy as well.<br><br>These are programs that target individuals who are most likely to be involved in gun violence, either as perpetrators or as victims &#8212; to deescalate tensions, to prevent retaliation, and to save lives.&nbsp; They have a significant wraparound services component &#8212; helping people with job placement, with healthcare, cognitive behavioral therapy, education, and a number of other services to help folks get their lives on a different track and to prevent violence.<br><br>The White House is going to be launching &#8212; is launching a CVI collaborative of 15 different jurisdictions that are investing their ARP money or other public funds into CVI programs to save lives this summer and beyond.&nbsp; The White House is going to support them.&nbsp; They will also receive support from a group of funders who are coming together to invest millions of dollars over the next 18 months to support these efforts.<br><br>In addition, the Treasury Department guidance that [senior administration official] referenced reiterates that the $350 billion in state and local funding can be used for CVI programs &#8212; that is that CVI programs are eligible uses of that money.<br><br>The Department of Education has put out guidance as well.&nbsp; That guidance went out on Thursday of last week.&nbsp; It reiterates that the $122 billion in K-through-12 funding in ARP can be used for these purposes as well, where there&#8217;s education or student-focused components to the programs.<br><br>We put out guidance &#8212; these agencies put out guidance earlier this year as well.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re emphasizing this to make crystal clear that these funds can be used for these purposes.<br><br>And, of course, this all builds on the President&#8217;s historic commitment to secure $5.2 billion of funding for community violence interventions through the American Jobs Plan and the President&#8217;s discretionary budget request.<br><br>As [senior administration official] mentioned, we have also pivoted 26 programs over five days across five agencies to support this work.<br><br>The next element of the strategy is expanding summer programs and employment opportunities, as well as other services, for young people.&nbsp; As you may know, young people are less likely to commit crime when they&#8217;re productively engaged in the summer, and that is true for gun violence as well.&nbsp; There are evaluations that have been done showing that violence is reduced as much as 35 or 45 percent, depending on the city and the program, based on summer youth employment opportunities and other services.<br><br>The Biden administration &#8212; the Biden-Harris administration is included in the guidance from the Treasury and Education departments that ARP funding can be used to hire additional school counselors, nurses, social workers, and other practitioners who can support youth and young people during the summer, but these funds can also be used for summer job and summer education programs, and they can be used for wraparound services, such as housing assistance, healthcare, substance use disorder, and food assistance.<br><br>Also, I want to mention that, as part of this strategy, the Department of Labor recently awarded $119 million in workforce development grants to serve young people in particular.&nbsp;<br><br>The fifth part of the strategy here is to help formerly incarcerated individuals successfully reenter their communities.&nbsp; Helping formerly incarcerated individuals is a public safety strategy.&nbsp; We know that finding a good job makes a person much less likely to recidivate.<br><br>Yesterday, the Department of Labor awarded $85 million to help people in 28 communities transition from incarceration to employment.&nbsp; Those funds will serve approximately 9,000 people.<br><br>In addition, the Office of Personnel Management &#8212; OPM &#8212; will examine barriers to employment for formerly incarcerated people within the federal government and will consider steps to remove those barriers, including potentially creating new hiring authority for agencies to hire formerly incarcerated people into the excepted service.&nbsp; These are one-year appointments that can be extended for a second year and that help build a person&#8217;s experience and their employment history and make them more competitive for federal jobs in the future.<br><br>OPM is also going to be issuing regulations under the &#8220;ban the box&#8221; legislation, the Fair Chance Act from 2019.&nbsp;<br><br>In addition, the Department of Justice is going to bring back the Second Chance fellowship.&nbsp; That is a program that will, through a competitive grant solicitation, bring a formerly incarcerated person into the Justice Department to serve in a role working on reentry issues and bring their expertise to bear.<br><br>On top of that, the Departments of Labor and Treasury are going to be taking steps to educate employers and help them understand how they can leverage existing tax credits to incentivize the hiring of formerly incarcerated individuals.&nbsp;<br><br>There&#8217;s something called the Work Opportunity Tax Credit.&nbsp; It applies to multiple categories, including people with convictions &#8212; with felony convictions.&nbsp; And employers who hire individuals in this category can receive up to $2,400 in credit against their federal income tax if they are hiring a person within one year of the person&#8217;s conviction or release from prison for a felony offense.<br><br>The Departments of Labor and Treasury are going to take steps to ensure that employers know about this tax credit and how to leverage it in relationship with other tax credits to incentivize the hiring of these individuals.<br><br>Finally, the Department of Housing and Urban Development is going to be putting out a letter from Secretary Fudge, outlining actions that HUD is taking to address the housing needs of formerly incarcerated individuals &#8212; returning citizens &#8212; and specifically how the 70,000 emergency housing vouchers that are funded by the American Rescue Plan can be used to support these individuals.&nbsp; Because if they&#8217;re coming out of prison and they don&#8217;t have a stable housing situation, then they meet the definition of being at risk of homelessness in the ARP.&nbsp; And the &#8212; Secretary Fudge is going to be lifting this up.<br><br>This is an important part of the President&#8217;s strategy because it is not just jobs, it is a whole fleet of services that are necessary to ensure successful reentry, including stable housing.<br><br>So that completes the fifth piece, and I&#8217;m going to turn it back to you, [senior administration official].<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; All right.&nbsp; Thank you, [senior administration official].&nbsp; And thank you, [senior administration official].&nbsp; Just as a reminder: This is on background, attributable to “senior administration officials.”&nbsp;<br><br>We will now open it up for some question and answer.&nbsp; If you have a question, please press the “raise hand” button on Zoom, and then we will get to as many questions as we can.&nbsp; Just give it one minute for anyone who has a question.&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey, thanks, guys.&nbsp; Can you hear me?&nbsp;<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yeah.<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; We can.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay, thanks so much for doing this.&nbsp; So, as I understand it, the strategy gives cities the ability to use $350 billion in ARP funds to hire police officers or invest in community programs.&nbsp; But is the administration giving guidance about what ratio should go to what?&nbsp; Like is &#8212; what’s to stop communities from spending 99 percent on police officers and only a token amount on community programs?<br><br>And a second question on the CVI collaborative: It says that those cities are, you know, dedicating a portion of that to community interventions.&nbsp; Is there a sense of, like, which portion of that?&nbsp; I know it&#8217;s another ratio question.<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Absolutely.&nbsp; I&#8217;m going to turn it over to my colleague to take the second question, and then I&#8217;m happy to take the first one.&nbsp;<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Yeah, thanks.&nbsp; No, there&#8217;s not a specific percentage that&#8217;s being required as part of the involvement in the collaborative here.&nbsp; But these are going to be significant investments from each of the cities, and I think maybe we could follow up with further information about that.&nbsp; But it&#8217;s not a, kind of, hard and fast &#8212; and that is because it&#8217;s important that there not be a, kind of, “one size fits all” approach to public safety here.&nbsp;<br><br>And the President is &#8212; the President’s strategy on combating gun crime is meant to allow cities and other local jurisdictions to tailor their approaches to public safety and gun violence and gun crime reduction to their own particular circumstances.&nbsp;<br><br>So we didn’t &#8212; we don&#8217;t want to artificially shape that from here.&nbsp; The President is giving individuals resources and giving cities resources and guidance to allow them to address the particular needs that they have.&nbsp;<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Thanks so much.&nbsp; And then, to address your first question, I think the answer is similar to what my colleague just said.&nbsp; What the Treasury gui- &#8212; the Treasury Department is clarifying tomorrow is that American Rescue Plan dollars can be used in cities that have experienced an increase in gun violence as a result of the pandemic to pursue a range of policies that are tailored to reduce gun violence.&nbsp;<br><br>So a city can choose to use funding to advance community policing to be responsive to gun violence in that community.&nbsp; Cities can also choose &#8212; in addition to or instead &#8212; to invest in community violence intervention or to invest in summer program opportun- &#8212; programming opportunities, job training opportunities, all of the tools in the toolkit.<br><br>The President is giving these cities unprecedented resources through the American Rescue Plan to invest in the tools they think make sense in their communities.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey, yes, thanks for doing this.&nbsp; I just want to ask:&nbsp; I mean, in the big picture, can you speak about how it seems like the American Rescue Plan is central to this overall strategy to combat violence in cities.&nbsp; Can you talk about how &#8212; I mean, how important you think it is?&nbsp; And were the funds designed with this in mind in the first place?&nbsp; Or is this kind of retroactively, it just seems like, that this can be helpful to your efforts?<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Yeah, so the American Rescue Plan was designed to help community &#8212; well, the state and local funding in the American Rescue Plan was designed to help state and local governments respond to the impacts of the pandemic &#8212; one of them being an increase in gun violence, which can be attributed to a range of opt- &#8212; a range of reasons resulting from the pandemic, secondary impacts of the pandemic.&nbsp;<br><br>And the funding that the President is providing for the American Rescue Plan is historic in terms of the flexibility and the opportunity it provides to these communities to make changes that can have effects in the weeks and months ahead.&nbsp;<br><br>It is, of course, only part of the comprehensive strategy that the President is putting forward.&nbsp; You know, not everything comes down to funding, but the other big funding piece here is the President continues to call for Congress to invest $5 billion over eight years in community violence interventions.&nbsp;<br><br>We also have a range of non-budget actions that the President &#8212; that the administration is taking, including the new zero tolerance lens that the Justice Department will be using with dealers who willfully violate policies.&nbsp;<br><br>So I would say that the American Rescue Plan funding is a critical resource that the President is giving cities and states right now to help reduce gun violence in their communities.&nbsp; It is one of the tools that the President is giving these cities and states through this comprehensive strategy.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, thanks for doing this call.&nbsp; There are a number of governors and state legislatures that are either contemplating or have taken actions to constrain state law enforcement from enforcing federal gun laws.&nbsp; And really, there is a growing movement to just ignore a lot of federal gun laws in many states which have Republican-controlled legislatures and governors mansions.&nbsp; Is the administration prepared to take any action to counter this or push back against state governments that are going to resist enforcing federal firearms laws?<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Yeah, thanks so much for the question.&nbsp; I know that there are a number of cases of this in ongoing enforcement decisions, which I would refer you to the Justice Department to respond to.&nbsp;<br><br>What I will say is that, in the midst of all these state actions, more broadly, the President continues to push for legislative action at the federal level and continues to push, and we continue to see progress at the same time.&nbsp;<br><br>And many states are leading the way, in terms of enacting policies that will help reduce gun violence in our country, whether that be universal background checks at the state level, banning untraceable ghost guns at the state level, passing extreme risk protection order laws at the state level, or more.&nbsp;<br><br>So the President, over the past few months, has been focusing on calling on federal &#8212; calling on Congress to act and encouraging constructive state action.&nbsp;<br><br>And I would refer you to the Justice Department regarding the enforcement question you asked.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi.&nbsp; Thank you for doing this.&nbsp; And thank you for taking my question.&nbsp; I have a question about some conservative groups &#8212; in particular, the Heritage Foundation has pointed to some of the policies that prosecutors in cities like Baltimore &#8212; whose mayor will be at tomorrow&#8217;s meeting &#8212; have decided, you know, in some cases, not to prosecute minor crimes, such as drug offenses.&nbsp; And they say that&#8217;s what&#8217;s contributed to the rise in crime in some of these cities.&nbsp;<br><br>How do you feel that these efforts will address that particular issues when it comes to prosecuting crimes?&nbsp;<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; So, I will say that the President is giving state and local officials a number of tools to choose from in order to reduce crimes in their communities.&nbsp;<br><br>One of the resources the Justice Department, in its comprehensive strategy it released last month, makes clear that it is deploying U.S. Attorneys, U.S. Marshals, DEA, ATF to help cities that need assistance with investigations and enforcement.&nbsp; He has helped &#8212; those resources will be made available to cities who need support in going after dealer &#8212; gun dealers or other parties that are contributing to gun violence in this country.&nbsp; Because the levels of gun violence in this country are unacceptable and we need action.<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; And again, I just want to add that, you know, our focus is on gun violence.&nbsp; That&#8217;s where the President&#8217;s focus is.&nbsp; That&#8217;s the problem that we&#8217;re seeing right now: Homicide is up 30 percent in 2020 over 2019; up again in the first quarter of this year.&nbsp; That&#8217;s gun violence, primarily.&nbsp; Gun assaults are up.<br><br>When you look &#8212; when you dig into the crime statistics, you see that there are some crimes &#8212; some crimes that are trending down, including property crimes and some low-level crimes.&nbsp; That varies by jurisdiction.&nbsp; But what we are &#8212; where we are seeing the increase is in gun violence.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s why it is &#8212; the gun crime is the centerpiece here &#8212; the focus of the President&#8217;s strategy.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi.&nbsp; Thanks so much for taking my call.&nbsp; I was &#8212; I&#8217;m curious, given that states still have to apply for the Rescue Plan funds, is &#8212; does this represent, tomorrow, any shift in the way that their applications might be considered?&nbsp; If they, for instance, have a greater amount of funding that they&#8217;d like to use for policing versus other initiatives, should this be a signal to cities or to states that are applying for this money that they can change or shift their application in any way?&nbsp; Thanks.<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; I mean, these funds are going out the door.&nbsp; Look at the numbers: $190 billion in the State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds have already been dispersed, and more is going out.&nbsp;<br><br>So the intent here is not to hold jurisdictions to any particular piece of the strategy.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a comprehensive strategy, and it recognizes that local needs need to shape local public safety and gun crime reduction strategies.&nbsp;<br><br>So the guidance that is coming from the Treasury Department that clarifies what ARP funds can be used for includes, you know, a multitude of different public safety strategies that [senior administration official] and I covered &#8212; from policing, to community violence intervention, to summer job programs, to services &#8212; wraparound services, to substance abuse, substance use disorder treatment.&nbsp; These are a variety of strategies that cities will be able to avail themselves of.&nbsp;<br><br>The encouragement here is to use ARP funds to combat gun crime and bring about public safety.<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; And I would just add that we&#8217;ve already heard from cities and states that are eager and excited to have the opportunity to use American Rescue Plan state and local dollars for the types of gun violence reduction strategies that we&#8217;re outlining.&nbsp; And you should expect us to continue to encourage cities and states to take this opportunity, through the American Rescue Plan, to reduce violence in their communities.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi.&nbsp; Thank you so much for the call.&nbsp; I&#8217;m calling from Atlanta, where we have seen, of course, a surge in gun violence, but also a problem with a decrease in police officers on the force and a decrease in morale.&nbsp; I wanted to know how this plan would possibly address that issue with cities that need more officers on the force but, right now, haven&#8217;t had a way to incentivize that?<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Yeah, thanks so much for your question.&nbsp; And I am from Atlanta, so I especially appreciate the question.&nbsp;<br><br>So you have heard the President say again and again that community-oriented policing is one part of a strategy to make our communities safer.&nbsp; The President&#8217;s budget requests $300 million of an increase for the Community-Oriented Policing Services Hiring Programs, and he continues to press for that funding.&nbsp;<br><br>Most immediately, though, what this plan does is: The Treasury is making clear that the &#8212; that cities and states experiencing a surge in gun violence as a result of the pandemic may use their &#8212; a portion of their American Rescue Plan dollars &#8212; the $350 billion in state and local funding &#8212; for purposes that are including hiring law enforcement officials, even above pre-pandemic levels, or paying overtime where the funds are directly focused on advancing community-policing strategies in those communities experiencing an increase in gun violence associated with the pandemic.&nbsp;<br><br>So a city like Atlanta, experiencing a surge in gun violence as a result of a pandemic, could choose to use a portion of their American Rescue Plan dollars to hire more officers or to pay them overtime when those funds would be used to advance community policing.<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; All right, thank you everyone for joining tonight.&nbsp; As a reminder, this call is embargoed until 5:00 a.m., Eastern, tomorrow.&nbsp; And the contents of it are attributable to &#8220;senior Biden administration officials.&#8221;&nbsp;<br><br>If you have any questions, feel free to email me.&nbsp; Again, one final reminder: This is embargoed until 5:00 a.m. Eastern tomorrow.&nbsp;<br><br>Thanks, everyone.&nbsp;<br><br><br>7:45 P.M. EDT</p>
