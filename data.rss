<p>7:09 P.M. JST</p>



<p>MR. PATEL:&nbsp; Good evening, everybody.&nbsp; Thanks so much for joining.&nbsp; This call will be on the record and embargoed until 4:15 Japan Standard Time tomorrow, May 23rd.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Joining us for this briefing, we have National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo, and U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai.</p>



<p>We, of course, will have some time for questions at the end, but I will turn it over to Jake to kick us off.</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; And thanks, everybody, for joining this evening.&nbsp; And thanks to my colleagues and partners, Secretary Raimondo and Ambassador Tai.</p>



<p>I wanted to just start with some broad comments about the thrust and purpose of IPEF, and then – and then turn it over to the Secretary and the Ambassador to dive into some more detail on the key substantive elements of the framework.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, or IPEF, is part of President Biden&#8217;s commitment to putting American families and workers at the center of our economic and foreign policy, while strengthening our ties with allies and partners for the purpose of increasing shared prosperity and for the purpose of defining the coming decades for technological innovation in the global economy &#8212; especially in the most vital region for the coming decades, the Indo-Pacific.</p>



<p>The President will launch IPEF in Tokyo, Japan, on Monday.&nbsp; And joining him for that launch will be the initial IPEF partner countries.&nbsp; They are as follows: Australia, Brunei, India, Indonesia, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam.&nbsp; Alongside the United States, that&#8217;s 13 countries launching this &#8212; a baker&#8217;s dozen.</p>



<p>But, of course, as we&#8217;ve also indicated from the start, this is an open platform.&nbsp; So there are other countries that could conceivably join us as we move forward.</p>



<p>Together, this very diverse set of economies represent around 40 percent of global GDP.&nbsp; And the fact that we have such a range and a significant number of partner countries in on the ground floor for the launch reflects the far-reaching ambition of the framework and also indicates that there&#8217;s deep interest across the region in it.&nbsp; You&#8217;ve got major economies, emerging economies, economies with which we have free trade agreements, and others for which this will be the United States’ first economic negotiation.</p>



<p>And that diversity of members is consistent with both the vision of IPEF and consonant with the fact that the four-pillar structure that we&#8217;ve built has flexibility and creativity designed into it so that we can, in fact, accommodate this diverse range of countries.</p>



<p>One more thing, just to say on the membership: We believe that we&#8217;re heading into this launch with a really significant amount of momentum, really, especially coming out of the U.S.-ASEAN Summit that the President hosted just a few days ago.&nbsp; It was at that summit that he had the opportunity to really share his vision for this framework with key leaders in ASEAN.&nbsp; And we are proud that seven ASEAN countries have joined with many of our other close partners in the region as part of IPEF.</p>



<p>IPEF is a 21st century economic arrangement designed to tackle 21st century economic challenges, ranging from setting the rules of the road for the digital economy, to ensuring secure and resilient supply chains, to helping make the kinds of major investments necessary in clean energy infrastructure and the clean energy transition, to raising standards for transparency, fair taxation, and anti-corruption.</p>



<p>We believe that expanding U.S. economic leadership in the Indo-Pacific through vehicles like IPEF is good for America &#8212; American workers and businesses as well as for the people in the region. &nbsp;</p>



<p>With 60 percent of the world&#8217;s population, the Indo-Pacific is projected to be the largest contributor to global growth over the next 30 years.&nbsp; And trade with the Indo-Pacific supports more than 3 million American jobs, as well as being the source of nearly $900 billion in foreign direct investment in the United States &#8212; (inaudible) global economic growth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And the United States, for our part, is an Indo-Pacific economic power.&nbsp; Foreign direct investment in the region from the United States totaled more than $969 billion in 2020 and has nearly doubled in the last decade.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And the United States is the primary exporter of services to the region, which in turn not only fuels regional growth and prosperity and greater security, but it also supports American jobs at home.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That being said, we and our partners in the region agree that much in the coming decades will depend on how well governments harness innovation, especially the transformations underway in clean energy and the digital and technology sectors, while at the same time fortifying our economies from a range of threats from fragile supply chains, to corruption, to tax havens.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The fact is that past models did not address these challenges &#8212; or did not address them fully and take them head on &#8212; leaving our workers, businesses, and consumers more vulnerable.&nbsp; So we believe that we need a new model that we can move on quickly to, in fact, take these challenges head on, and that&#8217;s what IPEF will do.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve spent months engaging with major partners in the region.&nbsp; And the broad participation is a reflection of that investment of time and effort and energy, as well as with organized labor, the business community, bipartisan members of Congress and other key stakeholders to chart the way forward.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just a couple of more points before I turned to my colleagues &#8212; in terms of diving into the four pillars of IPEF.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One, the fact that this is not a traditional free trade agreement is a feature of IPEF not a bug.&nbsp; There are free trade traditionalists who have raised questions about it.&nbsp; Our fundamental view is that the new landscape and the new challenges we face need a new approach, and we will shape the substance of this effort together with our partners.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Second is that IPEF should be seen both as a coherent whole; it is a vision of the modern economy and the way to get &#8212; it’s a way to tackle the challenges and seize the opportunities of that economy.&nbsp; But it also &#8212; it should also be seen as an opportunity to drive initiatives, in part.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, for example, if we can rapidly develop an early warning system for critical supply chains, we will not wait until all of IPEF is complete to roll that out and move forward on it.&nbsp; So different elements of this could end up moving at different speeds, even as all of the pieces will end up fitting into a larger integrated framework.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Finally &#8212; and I think this is really critical &#8212; this is a foundational element of our overall strategy towards the Indo-Pacific.&nbsp; We believe that IPEF brings shape and coherence to the economic pillar of our Indo-Pacific strategy.&nbsp; We think it sets us up for success in helping to shape the future of the region in a way that produces a region that is free, open, connected, resilient, and secure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We all know that economics is a critical part of succeeding with any strategy in the Indo-Pacific region.&nbsp; And we see IPEF as a vital platform for our engagement and a chance, alongside all of the other ways in which we have elevated our engagement in the Indo-Pacific, to put our stamp on this critical region for decades to come, and to ensure that American leadership delivers good outcomes for our people and for all the people in the region.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, with those opening framing comments, let me turn it over to Secretary Raimondo.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>



<p>SECRETARY RAIMONDO:&nbsp; Thank you, Jake.&nbsp; And thank you, everybody, for joining us on the call this evening.&nbsp; So I will add on with a few more points to what Jake said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But I&#8217;ll begin by saying just how excited we are for the launch tomorrow of this Indo-Pacific Economic Framework.&nbsp; As Jake said, it consists of 13 countries, which account for 40 percent of global GDP.&nbsp; And on top of that, it includes some of the world&#8217;s fastest-growing, most dynamic economies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is &#8212; it is, by any account, the most significant international economic engagement that the United States has ever had in this region.&nbsp; And the launch of it tomorrow, here in Tokyo, marks an important turning point in restoring U.S. economic leadership in the region and presenting Indo-Pacific countries an alternative to China&#8217;s approach to these critical issues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since I&#8217;ve been Commerce Secretary, I have heard over and over again from the U.S. business community that they will benefit from &#8212; they and their employees will benefit from the U.S. restoring and re-exerting economic leadership in the region &#8212; an increasingly important region to U.S. businesses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And there is also a strong demand signal coming from the region.&nbsp; We hear over and over again in the Indo-Pacific region that there is a desire for U.S. economic leadership and for the U.S. to have a proactive economic vision and economic agenda.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As Jake said, this framework is intentionally designed not to be a “same old, same old” traditional trade agreement.&nbsp; But it&#8217;s designed as a more innovative and flexible approach, designed to reflect the fact that our economies have changed.&nbsp; The most pressing issues that we need to tackle with our allies have changed, and we need a new approach going forward if we&#8217;re going to meet the needs of our citizens.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, by focusing on economic priorities that affect all of our economies, this framework is designed to reflect the shared realities we face, which is climate change; the opportunity and challenges presented by moving, meeting the need of climate change and the opportunity of clean tech jobs; supply chain disruptions; and the need for a better-coordinated, high-tech manufacturing economy.</p>



<p>As Jake said, there are four pillars in the framework.&nbsp; The Department of Commerce will be leading three of the four pillars, which is: the supply chain resiliency pillar, clean energy and decarbonization pillar, and tax and anti-corruption.</p>



<p>Just very quickly on each one.&nbsp; On supply chains, I think we all have seen how &#8212; the cost of supply chains that aren&#8217;t resilient.&nbsp; And COVID exposes incredible economic costs of insufficient supply chain resilience.</p>



<p>We saw &#8212; frankly, we continue to say all the ways that bottlenecks and lack of transparency in the Indo-Pacific cause ripple effects throughout the United States economy, hurting workers and driving inflation.&nbsp; And, you know, we&#8217;ve learned that “just in time” leaves much to be desired.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I would say if we had had this Indo-Pacific Economic Framework and the agreement therein in place before COVID, I think we could have experienced much less disruption.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, during COVID, we saw semiconductor packaging operations in Malaysia be closed on account of COVID outbreaks.&nbsp; The result of that was thousands of workers were put out of work in Michigan auto-manufacturing plants.&nbsp; And if we had had more transparency, more communication, more data-sharing, and an early alert system, that may not have happened.&nbsp; And the workers who were furloughed in a Michigan plant would not have experienced that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, in IPEF, we are seeking to develop a first-of-its-kind supply chain agreement that better anticipates, predicts, and, importantly, prevents disruptions in supply chains.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the clean energy and infrastructure pillar, we all know jobs of the future are going to be in clean tech manufacturing and innovation, and so we want to work with partners in this agreement to view clean energy as a driver of job creation and economic growth.&nbsp; And to support this pillar, we will be signing agreements to pursue concrete, high-ambition commitments such as renewable energy targets, carbon removal purchasing commitments, energy efficiency standards, and new measures to combat methane emissions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And finally, the third pillar Commerce is leading on is the tax and anti-corruption.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re going to be working to ensure everybody plays by the same set of rules, because corruption is a huge drag on everyone&#8217;s economy.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re going to be seeking commitments to enact and enforce effective tax, anti-money laundering, anti-bribery schemes in line with our values.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, I guess I&#8217;ll just close by saying: This is an exciting time.&nbsp; I want to thank all of our partner countries for working with us.&nbsp; I&#8217;m looking forward &#8212; tomorrow is the beginning; I&#8217;m anxious to begin and get to work and discuss the next steps ahead as we negotiate the specific terms and develop the details of this framework and, you know, establishing a new approach to regional economic engagement.</p>



<p>This has never been done before, in terms of the ambition and inclusivity across a broad range of regional partners.&nbsp; And I&#8217;m confident that there&#8217;ll be benefits for U.S. businesses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I would say, especially as businesses are beginning to increasingly look for alternatives to China, the countries in the Indo-Pacific Framework will be more reliable partners for U.S. businesses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So we&#8217;re excited to get going and develop a framework that will be durable and beneficial for American businesses and workers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And with that, I will turn it over to my partner in this endeavor, Ambassador Katherine Tai.</p>



<p>AMBASSADOR TAI:&nbsp; Thank you so much, Gina.&nbsp; I will spend some time to talk about the trade pillar.&nbsp; From day one of his administration, President Biden has been clear that we have to rethink what trade policy can be in the 21st century and that it must benefit more people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For decades, trade policy was often reduced to a zero-sum game that left many of our workers behind.&nbsp; And that is why we are designing trade policies that aim to deliver real economic prosperity and advance our global priorities, like combating climate change, protecting labor rights, and building resilient supply chains.&nbsp; These issues are not mutually exclusive; we can and must do both.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over the last several months, USTR, the NSC, and the Department of Commerce have worked with our trading partners, members of Congress, and a diverse range of stakeholders on the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework that the President will launch tomorrow.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At its core, the Economic Framework will link major economies and emerging ones to tackle 21st century challenges and promote fair and resilient trade for years to come.&nbsp; At the same time, it will be designed to adapt to address barriers and obstacles that may arise in the future as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You heard Gina describe three of the pillars.&nbsp; And I&#8217;ll walk through the details of the trade pillar that USTR will lead in order to create a more connected and resilient economy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We will work with our IPEF partners on a wide range of trade issues, including the digital economy and emerging technology, labor commitments, the environment, trade facilitation, transparency and good regulatory practices, and corporate accountability.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The digital economy in particular best represents an area where we need to work with our IPEF partners, given the prominent role it plays in today&#8217;s global marketplace and how it affects our workers, our consumers, and our businesses.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s why we will address issues in the digital economy that will help build connectivity and trust between key markets, including standards on cross-border data flows and data localizations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We will also work with our partners to address other digital concerns such as online privacy, discriminatory and unethical use of artificial intelligence.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Collectively, the trade pillar will unlock enormous economic value, including for small- and medium-sized businesses that historically have not benefited from trade agreements as much as their large counterparts have.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We also intend to pursue an accelerated implementation of the World Trade Organization&#8217;s Trade Facilitation Agreement, which will also address and improve the movement of goods across borders.&nbsp; We will see commitments with IPEF partners that facilitate agricultural trade through science-based decision making and the adoption of sound, transparent regulatory practices.&nbsp; This will help our farmers, our ranchers, and our fishers gain certainty for getting their products to the region.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While these provisions will help promote inclusive economic prosperity, we also want this framework be part of our broader strategy to make trade a race to the top.&nbsp; And that is why the IPEF will pursue an agenda for setting strong labor and environmental standards and corporate accountability provisions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In raising regional standards, we can set an example for the rest of the world to follow, which in turn helps all of our workers and communities.&nbsp; Our aim is for the IPEF to address the challenges in the 21st century global economy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tomorrow begins the next chapter of our collaboration with our key partners in the region.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I look forward to convening our partners in the months ahead in a range of forms.&nbsp; We will continue to work with stakeholders, as we have done for the last several months, to ensure a diverse range of interests and concerns are represented.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We will work with members of Congress in both parties.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, of course, we will make frequent trips to the Indo-Pacific to engage leaders in this region and continue our discussions to create a fairer, more resilient economy for families, workers, and business in the United States and here in the Indo-Pacific.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is truly a team effort.&nbsp; And I&#8217;m grateful to Jake Sullivan and Secretary Raimondo for their work in bringing this framework to life.&nbsp; We believe it will deliver on the President&#8217;s vision of trade policy that promotes widespread economic growth and advances our shared global priorities.&nbsp; And I&#8217;m excited to continue to keep all of you updated on our progress as we move forward.</p>



<p>Thank you.</p>



<p>MR. PATEL:&nbsp; Thanks so much.&nbsp; We will move into taking some folks’ questions.&nbsp; As a reminder, this call is on the record, but it is embargoed until 4:15 Japan Standard Time tomorrow, May 23th.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So with that, why don&#8217;t we start with Nancy Cook at Bloomberg.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, thank you so much for doing the call.&nbsp; I appreciate it.&nbsp; Just an overview question.&nbsp; You know, you talked a lot in the call about the commitments that you&#8217;re going to seek for these &#8212; for countries to join this agreement.&nbsp; Are there any requirements?&nbsp; Like, are you requiring participants to do anything?&nbsp; Or is it really, like, suggestions and recommendations and commitments that you&#8217;re seeking?</p>



<p>Really, I&#8217;m asking: Are there binding things or non-binding things?</p>



<p>SECRETARY RAIMONDO:&nbsp; So, this is Secretary Raimondo.&nbsp; I would say there will certainly be &#8212; like any other agreement, it will be a negotiation at which will &#8212; which will, you know, begin post-launch.&nbsp; So after tomorrow, we&#8217;ll spend the next &#8212; you know, the weeks ahead, scoping out each pillar.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But, yes, there will be firm commitments.&nbsp; There will be signed agreements.&nbsp; And like any agreement, you know, we plan to have high-standard commitments that will be enforceable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, also, like any agreement, I would say the greatest enforcement is that if you don&#8217;t hold up your end of the bargain, you don&#8217;t receive the benefits.&nbsp; And so there will be incentives to go ahead and live up to the commitments that will be part of the agreement.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just to follow up, Secretary Raimondo: But tomorrow &#8212; like, what you&#8217;re unveiling tomorrow, there are not commitments in place at this point.&nbsp; There are not, like, binding things.&nbsp; Those are going to be negotiated moving forward.&nbsp; Is that right?</p>



<p>SECRETARY RAIMONDO:&nbsp; Yep.&nbsp; Yes, exactly.&nbsp; Tomorrow is the beginning.&nbsp; Tomorrow &#8212; tomorrow is the starting gate.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s incredible that we have, you know, a dozen countries signed up to this.&nbsp; But, yes, tomorrow we begin the negotiations.&nbsp; And we will, in the weeks and months ahead, define precisely the de- &#8212; exactly what’s in each pillar and what each country will be committing to and signing up for.</p>



<p>MR. PATEL:&nbsp; Great, thanks so much.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Next, let&#8217;s go to Peter Baker with the New York Times.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi there.&nbsp; Thanks for doing the call, especially for doing it on the record.&nbsp; Could you just outline for us a little bit more about what was wrong with the TPP negotiated by the Obama-Biden administration, that we&#8217;re not getting back into it and that you&#8217;re trying to distinguish this from?&nbsp; In other words, what&#8217;s the big difference?</p>



<p>And what is the incentive for countries in the region that want market access and tariff reductions but don&#8217;t seem to be getting it as part of this agreement?</p>



<p>AMBASSADOR TAI:&nbsp; Hi, Peter.&nbsp; This is Katherine Tai.&nbsp; So let me take your question first and see if the others want to join in after.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With respect to TPP, I think that the biggest problem with it was that we did not have the support at home to get it through.&nbsp; If you look back at the years 2015 and 2016, and despite Herculean efforts, it could not be gotten through Congress.&nbsp; And then, in 2017, it was President Trump who took the United States out of it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think that there&#8217;s a very, very strong lesson there: that TPP, as it was envisioned, ultimately was something that was quite fragile and that the United States was not able to deliver on.&nbsp; And that informs very much our thinking about bringing the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, as it&#8217;s designed here, to the region &#8212; which is that trade is an important component of this, but not the only component.&nbsp; So that we are bringing in more robust and comprehensive approach to our partners in this region.&nbsp;</p>



<p><br>There has been a lot of swirl about the fact that there is not tariff liberalization incorporated into the scope of what we are engaging on here.&nbsp; And I think that also goes to the fact that the kinds of trade agreements, the traditional ones that we&#8217;ve done before, are very much a part of the practice that has brought us to where we are, both in terms of the fragility of where that trajectory has taken us.</p>



<p>But also, if you look at the world economy today, I just am &#8212; have arrived in Tokyo from the APEC meetings in Bangkok.&nbsp; And of all of the counterparts that I had the chance to speak with in depth, each one of them reiterated for me that their priorities in their economic policymaking, including in trade, are to promote an economic recovery that advances resilience, sustainability, and inclusion for their economies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And they&#8217;re looking for engagement, especially from us, around a vision for trade and economic engagement that will reinforce those priorities, given where we are in the global economy and a couple of very, very turbulent years that we&#8217;re all still working to recover from.</p>



<p><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, just to be clear then, the thing that made it &#8212; TPP &#8212; no good was it wasn&#8217;t able to be delivered, you couldn&#8217;t get it through Congress.&nbsp; Are these agreements that will come out of this process agreements that will go to Congress at some point?<br><br>AMBASSADOR TAI:&nbsp; Peter, on that, let me say this: I think that the robust stakeholder engagement that you are hearing all of us talk about &#8212; stakeholders throughout our economy, expanding the table for engagement with our stakeholders, engaging with our traditional stakeholders &#8212; we can&#8217;t &#8212; they have to be part of the solution and part of our engagement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But bringing to the table and ensuring that other stakeholders, like our workers, like our environmental organizations, the ones who are the smartest about climate and the policy solutions that we need, that they have premier seats at the table and that they will be influencing and shaping the policies that we create.<br><br>Our trading partners, our members of Congress &#8212; along the way, this engagement is designed for maximum supportability and durability because, ultimately, we know that this engagement is something that we need to stick for our partners and for our stakeholders at home in this region.</p>



<p><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All right, I&#8217;m confused.&nbsp; Does Congress vote on these agreements or not?<br><br>AMBASSADOR TAI:&nbsp; Let&#8217;s see where these negotiations take us, and let&#8217;s see where the discussions go.&nbsp; But along the way, we have to keep &#8212; regardless, we have to keep Congress close, and Congress needs to be a part of shaping what we do with our partners here.</p>



<p><br>MR. PATEL:&nbsp; Thanks so much.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s try to limit our follow-ups so we can get through as many of our colleagues as we can.&nbsp;<br><br>Next, let&#8217;s go to Asma Khalid from NPR.</p>



<p><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey, thank you guys for doing this.&nbsp; I had two quick questions.&nbsp; And one, I know, Jake, you touched on, actually, earlier a bit about Taiwan.&nbsp; But if I could just get clarity here on the record about why Taiwan was not a part of this initial grouping of countries or self-governed democracies &#8212; whatever you want to call Taiwan &#8212; given its role in supply chains.<br><br>And then the follow-up question is something that I also wanted to get clarity on &#8212; I believe Nancy touched on &#8212; around the incentives for countries to join.&nbsp; Can you articulate at all what those incentives are?&nbsp; Or have they not been, I guess, decided upon yet since negotiations haven&#8217;t begun with various countries?</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; I&#8217;ll make a couple of comments but then invite both Secretary Raimondo and Ambassador Tai, particularly on the second question.&nbsp; And Ambassador Tai should speak to the first one as well because she just met with her counterpart.&nbsp;<br><br>But I would just say that we intend to pursue a deeper bilateral engagement with Taiwan on trade and economic matters in the coming days and weeks.&nbsp; And we think that that track can help strengthen both of our economies while we&#8217;re also pursuing IPEF with the countries that we listed.&nbsp; And we think it puts us in the best position for us to be able to enhance our economic partnership with Taiwan and also to carry IPEF forward with this diverse range of countries.<br><br>Just briefly on what the U.S. has to bring to the table: I’d just start by saying that, you know, the premise of the question is that without market access, you know, countries wouldn&#8217;t be really interested.&nbsp; Well, we&#8217;ve got an incredible range of countries who&#8217;ve signed up to this, including some with whom we haven&#8217;t had meaningful economic negotiations before.<br><br>So why is that?&nbsp; One reason is because having the opportunity to work closely with the United States on rules and standards; on greater clarity and transparency and coordination on supply chains; on innovation, as it applies to the digital economy and the decarbonization; on technical expertise; on anti-corruption matters and taxation; on investment in infrastructure and in growing businesses, both foreign direct investment in the U.S. where we have a huge market to offer people for that and the enormous investment we&#8217;re making in the region &#8212; the United States is going to be a partner of choice on all of the elements of this framework, even setting aside the question of traditional tariff liberalization.<br><br>And so we think we bring a huge amount to the table.&nbsp; And we think that proposition has been validated by the fact that we&#8217;ve gotten such an overwhelming and broad-scale response from, you know, the Indian subcontinent, to Down Under, to Southeast Asia, to Northeast Asia.<br><br>And let me stop there and see if Katherine or Gina has anything they want to add.</p>



<p><br>SECRETARY RAIMONDO:&nbsp; No, I think that&#8217;s exactly right.&nbsp; You know, I would just offer additionally, having spent time in the region, the demand to have the United States increasingly present economically is so strong, which is why, as Jake said, you know, a dozen countries have decided to join us tomorrow for the launch.<br><br>You know, so, broadly, there is a strong desire to have U.S.&nbsp; businesses, the United States government engaged in the region.&nbsp;<br><br>Now, if you&#8217;re asking for kind of a list of specific issues, you know, it’s everything from trade facilitation &#8212; which, by the way, you know, we talk about there are non-tariff barriers, which often can be, you know, more expensive than tariffs, which &#8212; so, one, you know, we&#8217;ll have trade facilitation, as Katherine mentioned earlier; we&#8217;ll work together on technology standards to promote interoperable Internet and other kinds of standards.<br><br>I mean, the Commerce Department sets standards in technology.&nbsp; If you&#8217;re &#8212; if you don&#8217;t set standards in a way that allows your company to participate, you&#8217;re out of &#8212; out of business, you know?&nbsp; So that&#8217;s a binary.&nbsp;<br><br>Decarbonization of key industries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Capital.&nbsp; You know, we expect that for the infrastructure pillar, there will be sources of public and private capital flowing from the United States into the region; you know, into infrastructure projects in countries in the region.<br><br>So, anyway, the list is long.&nbsp; But I think that there will be, you know, a very concrete benefit to countries in the region.&nbsp;<br><br>By the way, just today, you know, you see reporting that Apple is looking to boost production outside of China.&nbsp; And many companies &#8212; many U.S. companies are looking to diversify away from China.&nbsp; Well, countries &#8212; Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia &#8212; that are actually signed up and in the Indo-Pacific Framework will obviously have an advantage to get that business from American companies, because they will have signed up to be the high-standard agreement that we plan to sign pursuant to the IPEF.<br><br>So I think once we get underway, the concrete benefits are going to become pretty clear.</p>



<p>AMBASSADOR TAI:&nbsp; This is Katherine Tai.&nbsp; Let me just very, very quickly &#8212; on the Taiwan question, I did just meet Minister John Deng in Bangkok.&nbsp; And we had a great conversation.&nbsp; It was a really, really encouraging and really dynamic meeting that we had.<br><br>And coming out of the conversation we had &#8212; I think this was just two days ago &#8212; both Minister Deng and I have committed that our teams would be in touch and that we&#8217;d be in touch in the next couple of weeks.&nbsp; So please stay tuned for that.<br><br>In terms of the tariff question &#8212; again, the tariff liberalization, let me just put an additional point, add on to what &#8212; all of the great examples that Gina has just provided, which is: You know, in our trade policies, our trade experiences and trade relationships, we have so many examples of situations where there are no tariffs between us and another country.&nbsp; And yet, you know, we have farmers who can&#8217;t get, for example, a single potato across the border and into the other market.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so, I just want to reinforce Secretary Raimondo’s point that, in terms of economic value, we&#8217;re looking at connectivity and we&#8217;re offering a program relating to connectivity for our stakeholders.&nbsp; And that goes beyond tariffs.<br><br>In fact, average bound tariff MFN for the United States right now is 2.4 percent.&nbsp; It&#8217;s very low.&nbsp; In terms of where the value is that is left to be unlocked in the global economy right now, it is in the areas where we are engaging through this framework.</p>



<p><br>MR. PATEL:&nbsp; Thanks so much.&nbsp; I think we have time for one last question before our speakers have to head to another commitment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Why don&#8217;t we go next to Trevor Hunnicutt with Reuters.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks for taking the question.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a quick one.&nbsp; Jake said that this is an open architecture arrangement.&nbsp; Does that mean that it&#8217;s open to all countries in the region, regardless of how they perform on indices of economic freedom and democracy?&nbsp; And what role do you see China potentially playing in this in the future?<br><br></p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; So I think one of the things we will do on a going-forward basis with addi- &#8212; in terms of additional members is work with the other countries that are now in &#8212; with the founding partners, so to speak &#8212; to determine both the process and criteria by which to add additional members.<br><br>And it won&#8217;t just be if you raise your hand, you&#8217;re automatically in.&nbsp; But we also want to maintain a proposition of inclusivity and diversity of economies.<br><br>So the short answer is that we will not dictate, just as the United States, who comes in going forward, but we&#8217;ll have to work that with our partners.&nbsp; And that will be part of those initial discussions that Secretary Raimondo referred to.&nbsp; But that will immediately follow from the launch event tomorrow.&nbsp;<br><br>Oh, and on China, just broadly speaking, those &#8212; the &#8212; what I just said would apply to that case.</p>



<p><br>MR. PATEL:&nbsp; Thank you so much.&nbsp; As a reminder to everybody, this call was on the record, but it is under embargo until tomorrow at 4:15 Japan Standard Time.&nbsp; Again, until 4:15 tomorrow, May 23rd, Japan Standard Time.<br><br>Thanks so much, everyone, for joining and a special thanks to our speakers.&nbsp; And we&#8217;ll all be in touch again over the course of this trip.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>IPEF will strengthen our ties in this critical region to define the coming decades for technological innovation and the global economy</em><br> <br><em>Framework will create a stronger, fairer, more resilient economy for families, workers, and businesses in the United States and in the Indo-Pacific region</em></p>



<p>Today in Tokyo, Japan, President Biden launched the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF) with a dozen initial partners: Australia, Brunei, India, Indonesia, Japan, Republic of Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. Together, we represent 40% of world GDP. &nbsp;<br><br>The United States is an Indo-Pacific economic power, and expanding U.S. economic leadership in the region is good for American workers and businesses — as well as for the people of the region. IPEF will enable the United States and our allies to decide on rules of the road that ensure American workers, small businesses, and ranchers can compete in the Indo-Pacific. As the President has said, tackling inflation is a top economic priority, and this framework will help lower costs by making our supply chains more resilient in the long term, protecting us against costly disruptions that lead to higher prices for consumers.<br><br>U.S. foreign direct investment in the region totaled more than $969 billion in 2020 and has nearly doubled in the last decade, and we are the leading exporter of services to the region, helping fuel regional growth. Trade with the Indo-Pacific supports more than three million American jobs and is the source of nearly $900 billion in foreign direct investment in the United States. With 60 percent of the world’s population, the Indo‑Pacific is projected to be the largest contributor to global growth over the next 30 years. &nbsp;<br><br>The United States and our partners in the region believe that much of our success in the coming decades will depend on how well governments harness innovation — especially the transformations afoot in the clean energy, digital, and technology sectors — while fortifying our economies against a range of threats, from fragile supply chains to corruption to tax havens. The past models of economic engagement did not address these challenges, leaving our workers, businesses, and consumers vulnerable. The framework will focus on four key pillars to establish high-standard commitments that will deepen our economic engagement in the region:</p>



<ul><li>Connected Economy: On trade, we will engage comprehensively with our partners on a wide range of issues. We will pursue high-standard rules of the road in the digital economy, including standards on cross-border data flows and data localization. We will work with our partners to seize opportunities and address concerns in the digital economy, in order to ensure small and medium sized enterprises can benefit from the region’s rapidly growing e-commerce sector, while addressing issues is such as online privacy and discriminatory and unethical use of Artificial Intelligence. We will also seek strong labor and environment standards and corporate accountability provisions that promote a race to the top for workers through trade. </li><li>Resilient Economy: We will seek first-of-their-kind supply chain commitments that better anticipate and prevent disruptions in supply chains to create a more resilient economy and guard against price spikes that increase costs for American families. We intend to do this by establishing an early warning system, mapping critical mineral supply chains, improving traceability in key sectors, and coordinating on diversification efforts.</li><li>Clean Economy: We will seek first-of-their-kind commitments on clean energy, decarbonization, and infrastructure that promote good-paying jobs. We will pursue concrete, high-ambition targets that will accelerate efforts to tackle the climate crisis, including in the areas of renewable energy, carbon removal, energy efficiency standards, and new measures to combat methane emissions. </li><li>Fair Economy: We will seek commitments to enact and enforce effective tax, anti-money laundering, and anti-bribery regimes that are in line with our existing multilateral obligations to promote a fair economy. These will include provisions on the exchange of tax information, criminalization of bribery in accordance with UN standards, and effective implementation of beneficial ownership recommendations to strengthen our efforts to crack down on corruption.</li></ul>

<p>Today, Japan and the United States affirm a partnership that is stronger and deeper than at any time in its history. Guided by our shared values; anchored by our common commitment to democracy and the rule of law; inspired by the innovation and technological dynamism of our economies; and rooted in the deep people-to-people ties between our countries, the Japan-U.S relationship is the cornerstone of a free and open Indo-Pacific region.<br>&nbsp;<br>It is in this spirit that Prime Minister&nbsp;of Japan KISHIDA Fumio welcomed Joseph R. Biden, Jr to Japan in his first visit as President of the United States. President Biden commended Prime Minister Kishida’s global leadership, including in&nbsp;the Japan-Australia-India-U.S.&nbsp;(Quad)&nbsp;Summit meeting.<br>&nbsp;<br>As global partners, Japan and the United States affirm that the rules- based international order is indivisible; threats to international law and the free and fair economic order anywhere constitute a challenge to our values and interests everywhere. Prime Minister Kishida and President Biden shared the view that the greatest immediate challenge to this order is Russia’s brutal, unprovoked, and unjustified aggression against Ukraine.&nbsp;The two leaders&nbsp;condemned Russia&#8217;s actions, and called for Russia to be held accountable for its atrocities. They reaffirmed their support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.&nbsp;The Prime Minister and the President underscored the importance of the international community’s unity, and expressed solidarity with the Ukrainian people in responding to Russia’s aggression through sanctions, including financial sanctions, export controls, and other steps, taken with like-minded countries to impose long-lasting economic costs on Russia.<br>&nbsp;<br>The two leaders shared the view that the United&nbsp;Nations&nbsp;(U.N.) forms the foundation of the rules-based international order, grounded in shared principles and universal values articulated in the U.N. Charter, including respect for human rights. Both commended the unprecedented global unity demonstrated by U.N. Member States in condemning Russia’s aggression against Ukraine and suspending it from the U.N. Human Rights Council. Recognizing that the U.N. Security Council (UNSC) has primary responsibility for&nbsp;the&nbsp;maintenance&nbsp;of&nbsp;international peace and security on behalf of the Member States, the two leaders expressed deep concern about Russia’s irresponsible behavior as a Permanent Member and its abuse of the veto, particularly Russia’s attempt to shield itself from accountability for its aggression against another Member State. The two leaders expressed a determination to strengthen the United Nations and to encourage all Member States to recommit to the vision and values enshrined in the U.N. Charter. Both expressed the need to strengthen and modernize the multilateral system to better enable it to meet&nbsp;the challenges of the 21st century.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>President Biden reiterated support for Japan’s permanent membership on a reformed Security Council, and for other countries who are important champions of multilateral cooperation and aspire to permanent seats.

<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong><em>Secretary Becerra Authorized Priority Orders of Input for Infant Formula</em></strong></p>



<p>The President is announcing the first two Defense Production Act (DPA) authorizations for infant formula. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra authorized the first two infant formula priority orders today. The two infant formula manufacturers can now begin to add legally binding language to their orders with suppliers that will give them priority over other customers. Last week, the President invoked the DPA to ensure that manufacturers have the necessary ingredients to make safe, health infant formula here at home.</p>



<p>Earlier today, the President announced the second Operation Fly Formula flight had been sourced for later this week. The flight will transport 114 pallets of Gerber Good Start® Extensive HA infant formula. This is the remainder of the equivalent of up to 1.5 million 8-ounce bottles of three formulas—Alfamino® Infant, Alfamino® Junior, and Gerber Good Start® Extensive HA—all of which are hypoallergenic formulas for children with cow’s milk protein allergy. The first tranche of this shipment arrived in the United States on DOD aircraft earlier today. These formulas have been prioritized because they serve a critical medical purpose and are in short supply in the United States because of the Abbott Sturgis plant closure.</p>



<p>Today’s infant formula priority orders are:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Abbott Nutrition </strong>can now receive priority orders of raw materials like sugar and corn syrup for infant formula. Constraints in global&nbsp; supply chain for these materials mean that Abbott’s allotment/allocation of these materials have been limited to 75 percent of its normal amount. By allowing Abbott to receive its full allotment of needed raw materials, it will be able to quickly increase production by one third over where it stands today.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Reckitt </strong>(which owns Mead-Johnson) can now receive priority orders of consumables like single-use products like filters necessary to generate certain oils needed to produce infant formula. This will also allow Reckitt facilities to operate at maximum capacity.</li></ul>



<p>The Biden-Harris Administration will continue to identify opportunities to invoke the Defense Production Act and further increase infant formula production to maximum capacity. The Biden-Harris Administration has been working around the clock to increase production of infant formula and keep store shelves stocked during the Abbott Nutrition voluntary recall.</p>

<p>Today, the Department of Defense (DOD) has sourced a second flight to fulfill the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)’s request for Operation Fly Formula to transport Nestlé S.A. formula from Ramstein Air Base in Germany to Washington Dulles International Airport. From there, the formula will be transported to a Nestlé facility in Pennsylvania. DOD is contracting with FedEx Express to transport the shipment via its integrated air and ground network. The flight and trucking will take place in the coming days. More details on timing will be announced when available.</p>



<p>The Operation Fly Formula shipments will transport 114 pallets of Gerber Good Start® Extensive HA infant formula. This is the remainder of the equivalent of up to 1.5 million 8-ounce bottles of three formulas—Alfamino® Infant, Alfamino® Junior, and Gerber Good Start® Extensive HA—all of which are hypoallergenic formulas for children with cow’s milk protein allergy. The first tranche of this shipment, announced on May 19, arrived in the United States via DOD aircraft on Sunday, May 22. These formulas have been prioritized because they serve a critical medical purpose and are in short supply in the United States because of the Abbott Sturgis plant closure.</p>



<p>President Biden launched Operation Fly Formula to speed up the import of infant formula and start getting more formula to stores as soon as possible. Under Operation Fly Formula, USDA and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) are authorized to use DOD-contracted commercial aircraft to pick up overseas infant formula that meets U.S. health and safety standards, so it can get to store shelves faster. In addition, President Biden has directed his Administration to take a number of other important actions to ensure there is enough safe infant formula for families, including invoking the Defense Production Act, entering into a consent agreement between the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to reopen Abbott Nutrition’s Sturgis facility, and issuing FDA guidance to allow major formula manufacturers to safely import formula that is not currently being produced for the U.S. market.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Aboard Air Force One<br>En Route Tokyo, Japan</p>



<p>4:33 P.M. JST<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Hi, everybody.&nbsp; Okay, I just have a quick topper, and then we’ll have Jake Sullivan for you guys.</p>



<p>Okay, just wanted to give a quick update on our administration’s work to speed up the import of infant formula and get more formula to stores.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Under Operation Fly Formula, the Departments of Agriculture and Health and Human Services are authorized to use Department of Defense contracted commercial aircraft to pick up overseas infant formula that meets U.S. health and safety standards so it can get to stores &#8212; store shelves faster.</p>



<p>On Sunday morning &#8212; or later today &#8212; a military plane will arrive in Indiana with 78,000 pounds of specialty infant formula, enough for over half a million bottles.&nbsp; This formula was manufactured in an FDA-approved facility and will be inspected on arrival like all food imports.</p>



<p>We prioritize this for the first shipment because this formula types &#8212; type serves a critical medical purpose and is in short supply in the United States as the result of the Abbott Sturgis plant closure.</p>



<p>We are working with USDA and HHS to ensure this formula goes to those who need it the most.&nbsp; Due to the urgency of the situation, the Secretary of Defense approved U.S. military aircraft for this mission on Friday evening.</p>



<p>Typically, the process to transport this product from Europe to U.S. would take two weeks.&nbsp; Thanks to Operation Fly Formula, we cut that down to approximately three days.</p>



<p>This is a testament of the President&#8217;s commitment to pulling every lever to get more infant formula onto the market.&nbsp; And Operation Fly Formula is one tool that we are using to do so.</p>



<p>Okay, I have Jake Sullivan, as you all can see &#8212; National Security Advisor.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jake, can we have you step in just a little bit?&nbsp; Thanks.</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; Hey, guys, just very briefly, you all know we&#8217;re on our way to Tokyo.&nbsp; And the President will spend tomorrow with Prime Minister Kishida and will also join a number of other leaders, some in person but largely virtually, to launch the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework.</p>



<p>And then, of course, on Tuesday, he&#8217;ll join the Quad leaders for the second Quad Summit and also have the opportunity to meet with Prime Minister Modi and to meet with a Prime Minister who will then &#8212; right now, Prime Minister-Designate; as of tomorrow, actual Prime Minister Albanese, who is flying up tomorrow to be able to join in person for the Quad on Tuesday, which we think is a real testament to Australia&#8217;s investment in the Quad as a critical vehicle for the Indo-Pacific and this new Prime Minister&#8217;s investment in hitting the ground running as a leader in the region and a close ally of the United States.</p>



<p>So, I’m happy to get into details on any and all things, but why don&#8217;t I just stop there and let you guys fire away.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are those meetings with Modi and Albanese one on one?</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; What do you mean by “one on one”?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is he meeting with them separately?</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; Yes.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; I mean, there’ll be other people in the room &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I’m talking about like &#8212; other than the Quad is what I meant.</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; Will have disti- &#8212; in addition to the Quad, he’ll have a distinct bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Modi and a distinct bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Albanese.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A question about the Quad meeting.&nbsp; On Taiwan: To what extent do you think that you guys will be talking with the Quad and other allies in Asia about a concrete action plan on how to respond if China were to invade Taiwan?&nbsp; And do you think that that action plan could include both military response and an economic response?&nbsp; So can you share a little bit about how much he&#8217;ll talk about that with the &#8212;</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; It won&#8217;t be part of the formal agenda of the Quad.&nbsp; But, of course, significant security issues in the Indo-Pacific will come up, and all of the Quad members share an interest in peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.&nbsp;</p>



<p>More broadly, the Biden administration is invested in working with allies and partners to send a clear message of deterrence and to support the basic policy of the Biden administration, which is a One China policy, the Three Joint Communiqués, and the Taiwan Relations Act, that we do not want to see unilateral changes to the status quo and we certainly don&#8217;t want to see military aggression.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And we do want that message coming not just from us, but from a range of allies and partners, both in the region and beyond.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re working with allies and partners accordingly.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jake, just to follow up on Taiwan, two questions.&nbsp; One, do you think it will appear in the Quad statement?&nbsp; And two, why is it not in the IPEF, given how important it is to global supply chains?</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; I&#8217;m not going to get ahead of the Quad statement.&nbsp; So, when we do the backgrounder tomorrow laying down the main components of Quad outcomes, you can pose that question at that point.</p>



<p>And then, in terms of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, I don&#8217;t think we have yet actually announced who is in and who is not in.&nbsp; That will be unveiled hopefully in a very dramatic fashion.&nbsp; No, I’m just kidding.&nbsp; That will be unveiled tomorrow.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the list finalized?</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; The list is finalized.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is Taiwan invited?</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; Taiwan won&#8217;t be part of the launch &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You said will or will not?</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; It will not be part of the launch of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework.</p>



<p>Ambassador Tai met with her counterpart from Taiwan just a couple of days ago.&nbsp; You can find a readout of that conversation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But we are looking to deepen our economic partnership with Taiwan, including on high-technology issues, including on semiconductors and supply chains.</p>



<p>But we&#8217;re pursuing that, in the first instance, on a bilateral basis while we work with a range of other countries through the framework.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And just one more follow-up on IPEF: China was out with some statements of Liu, the gentleman who is &#8212; deals with their policy on the Korean Peninsula.&nbsp; Said it&#8217;s basically closed &#8212; a closed club; there&#8217;s no reason to be doing that; things should be open and allow everybody in the Asia Pacific, including China, to join. &nbsp;What would you say in response to that?</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; It&#8217;s not a surprise to me that China has concerns about the number of countries, the diversity of countries who have expressed interest in and enthusiasm for IPEF.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so, you know, it&#8217;s natural that they&#8217;re going to try to find ways to raise questions.&nbsp; In this particular case, it&#8217;s just flatly untrue to call IPEF closed.&nbsp; It is by design and definition an open platform.&nbsp; And we do expect, in addition to the countries that join for the launch tomorrow, others will come along in the months and years ahead.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That being said, the breadth of participation tomorrow was such that it will very much show that it&#8217;s anything but a closed club.&nbsp; It is a &#8212; it is a very wide-ranging membership.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will South Korea be one of those countries?</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; Well, now you&#8217;re putting me in a funny spot, because I directly answered on Taiwan.&nbsp; If we start going down country by country, then I&#8217;ll be announcing the membership of the Quad just stan- &#8212; I mean, of the &#8212; of IPEF standing here right now.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, I&#8217;m going to leave the announcement of the participation to whatever Karine and the press team want to &#8212; want to do with that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But anyway &#8212; yeah, so I&#8217;ll leave it there.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is IPEF strictly just mostly economic policies at this point?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; Yes.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or does it also include addressing maritime security, when you talk about countering China’s &#8212;</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; No, it&#8217;s not &#8212; it&#8217;s not a security arrangement.&nbsp; It is an economic arrangement focused around the further integration of Indo-Pacific economies, setting of standards and rules, particularly in new areas like the digital economy, and also trying to ensure that there are secure and resilient supply chains.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In that sense, maritime security is a relevant issue.&nbsp; But IPEF will not be negotiating out maritime security arrangements.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jake, a quick follow, too.&nbsp; So, the administration &#8212; you, as well &#8212; have often framed foreign policy strategy as a global battle between autocra- &#8212; democracies and autocracies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I&#8217;m wondering how you balance trying to engage economically with someone like Prime Minister Modi, who himself has been accused, under the guise of democracy, of human rights abuses and maligning Muslim minorities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How do you balance accountability, approaching a bilateral like that, while also the desire to have an economic collaboration?</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; President Biden has been clear from the beginning of this administration that we&#8217;ll speak out when we see any form of departure from or deviation from basic principles, fundamental freedoms, human rights, the values of democratic institutions, and the rule of law.&nbsp; That&#8217;s true for a range of countries.&nbsp; And, you know, we don&#8217;t single India out.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And we have found a way both to pursue practical cooperation with countries that are democratic and non-democratic, while at the same time being clear and consistent of where our values lie.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are you going to push him on wheat exports?</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; I&#8217;m sorry?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are you going to push Modi &#8212; is the President going to push Modi on wheat exports?</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; I&#8217;ll just say that food security will be a topic of conversation at the Quad.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What about Russia?&nbsp; What about Russia and the invasion at large?&nbsp; What is he going to say to Modi about that?</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; Well, they&#8217;ve already had the opportunity to engage on that.&nbsp; And the President had an extended discussion with Prime Minister Modi when they did a virtual Quad Summit back in April.&nbsp; I think it was back in April, maybe even March.&nbsp; I think it was in March.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And they also got to speak about it when they had a short video bilateral meeting at the top of the 2+2 when the Indian ministers came to Washington.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So it won&#8217;t be a new conversation.&nbsp; It will be a continuation of the conversation they&#8217;ve already had about how we see the picture in Ukraine and the impacts of Russia&#8217;s brutal invasion of Ukraine on a wider set of concerns in the world, including this food security concern.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, they&#8217;ll talk all of that through.&nbsp; And I will leave the specifics of it to what has been a set of private and constructive exchanges, and I expect that this will similarly be constructive and straightforward.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jake, you&#8217;ve written a lot and talked a lot about there being a domestic angle to foreign policy.&nbsp; This weekend, you guys sent $40 billion to Ukraine.&nbsp; You&#8217;re going to announce IPEF.&nbsp; How does this fit into the domestic angle?&nbsp; What&#8217;s your message to people who are struggling with inflation back home about why these things are important to them?</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; Well, first, also this weekend, the President announced and held up major &#8212; or lifted up major new investments in the United States, job-creating investments that will help power the industries of the future, help the communities where those investments take place, employ thousands of workers.&nbsp; And that was true when he went to Samsung on Friday night, and it was true with the announcement with Hyundai this morning.&nbsp;</p>



<p><br>So this trip has, in part, been about not just talking the talk when it comes to delivering for American workers and American families when the President is engaged in foreign policy, but actually walking the walk and backing it up with real numbers that begin with a “B.”</p>



<p>Now, when it comes to the war in Ukraine, the President has been very straightforward that if &#8212; that if we, the United States, do not work with likeminded allies to stand up to aggression, we will pay a greater cost tomorrow.&nbsp; So he actually believes that this investment in the Ukrainian people&#8217;s fight to defend their country and in support of our allies who live under the shadow of Russian aggression is a worthy investment in terms of the long-term contribution it makes to peace, security, and stability.<br><br>That will benefit American families and American workers.&nbsp; And we actually think that the American people understand that and, more than understand that, they very much support it.&nbsp; And we see that on a bipartisan basis with the overwhelming votes in both the House and the Senate for that funding.<br><br>With IPEF, IPEF is designed to put workers at the center &#8212; American workers.&nbsp; It&#8217;s designed to create the kinds of high-standard approaches to the digital economy, to the clean energy transition, to diverse and resilient supply chains, to open and transparent economic governance that will ultimately benefit American workers, American families.&nbsp; And you&#8217;ll hear that from the President tomorrow.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay, Jake, I want to take a step back.&nbsp; The President, on this trip, has highlighted China&#8217;s economic slowdown.</p>



<p>In the past, building alliances like IPEF sometimes had been frustrated by China&#8217;s economic ascendancy and its rising power.&nbsp; What impact do you think the slowdown is having on the U.S.’s ability to build alliances in Asia?</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; I think that, also taking a step back, that all of the traditional expectations about trajectories of countries that have been baked in over the course of several years in the press narrative and, you know, in the public conversation, including in this region, are due for review and reconsideration.&nbsp; And the fact that the United States will grow faster than China this year, for the first time since 1976, is a quite striking example of how countries in this region should be looking at the question of trends and trajectories.<br><br>And &#8212; and so, what the President said yesterday in his remarks at the press conference was something he said repeatedly over the course of his career, which is: It&#8217;s never a good bet to bet against the United States.&nbsp; And actually, we think a lot of countries in this region are recognizing that fact.<br><br>And when you see the breadth of participation in IPEF tomorrow, we believe that that will be strong evidence that countries do want to bet on the United States, do want to be part of an economic arrangement with the United States where we&#8217;re setting rules together, we&#8217;re building diverse and resilient supply chains together, that American innovation is at the heart and American infrastructure investment is at the heart of the economic strategy of a lot of these countries.<br><br>So our view is that this is not about a zero-sum game with China.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not about forcing countries to choose.&nbsp; But it is about offering a value proposition that we think countries are taking extremely seriously.&nbsp; And we think that&#8217;ll be on display tomorrow.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, on &#8212; I was going to say, on China tariffs, is the administration close to deciding whether you&#8217;re going to ease those tariffs that the last administration put in place?<br><br>And then on inflation, do you think that lowering or easing some of those tariffs really would help with the inflation problem by helping reduce some prices for U.S. consumers?<br><br>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; So the President has asked his international economic team to run the analysis on the relationship between tariffs and inflation, both top-line inflation and, just frankly, the way that families experience inflation, which is: When they go to the store to buy everyday products, are the prices higher?&nbsp; Would removing tariffs lead price &#8212; those &#8212; those prices on those goods to be lower?<br><br>So he&#8217;s asked for that analysis, and he has also asked for the perspectives of the range of voices in his economic team for how to proceed when it comes to the overall approach to China trade.&nbsp; And he will make a decision, you know, as soon as he feels that he&#8217;s got the inputs he needs to do so.<br><br>So I won&#8217;t put a timetable on it.&nbsp; But, you know, he&#8217;s considering his options when it comes to moving beyond the Trump trade strategy as we look to chart a new way forward.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey, Jake, how long &#8212;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Has he &#8212; sorry, just to follow up &#8212; has he gotten the analysis back from those teams yet, or is he still waiting on that?<br><br>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; He has gotten analysis.&nbsp; He’s received detailed written work on this question, but he&#8217;s asked further questions and is looking for more input.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What can you tell us about the President&#8217;s briefing so far on monkeypox?&nbsp; And what&#8217;s your current understanding of whether there is a national stockpile of vaccine the President referred to?<br><br>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; So there &#8212; there is a vaccine that is relevant to treating monkeypox.&nbsp; We have vaccine available to be deployed for that purpose.</p>



<p>The &#8212; your question was about him being briefed?<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; And how often and by whom.</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; So, he has been briefed.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve been out on the road, giving him updates based on the written inputs we are getting from our health and medical team and, you know, walking through with him what the &#8212; what the current state of play looks like and, as we learn about cases both in the United States and elsewhere, making sure that he&#8217;s tracking the picture.</p>



<p>So he&#8217;s being apprised on this on a very regular basis and getting inputs from the key members of his health team.</p>



<p>On Korea, you&#8217;ve talked about the risk of a ballistic missile test, or something like that, during the President&#8217;s visit.&nbsp; What does it say that, so far, such an incident hasn&#8217;t occurred?</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; It&#8217;s hard to speculate, honestly.&nbsp; And anytime people start speculating on what North Korea might or might not do, they tend to have their expectations confounded one way or another.</p>



<p>So, all we can do is control our policy and our approach.&nbsp; So, we were prepared for any contingency while we were in Korea, we&#8217;re prepared for any contingency while we&#8217;re in Japan, and we will stay very closely lashed up with the ROK and Japan on this.</p>



<p>And if North Korea acts, we’ll be prepared to respond.&nbsp; If North Korea doesn&#8217;t act, North Korea has the opportunity, as we&#8217;ve said repeatedly, to come to the table and start negotiating (inaudible).</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quick follow-up on that.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(Inaudible) still saying that they could do a test?</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; Oh, yes.&nbsp; Yes.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So how are you going to measure the seriousness, the sincerity that the President talked about yesterday?&nbsp; How are you &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does the intelligence still say that there could still be a test?</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; There could be a test.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, thank you.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So how are you going to measure the seriousness and sincerity?</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; The first step would be for North Korea to come forward and be prepared to actually engage in a dialogue.&nbsp; And thus far, they&#8217;ve not shown that they&#8217;re willing to do so.</p>



<p>From there, it &#8212; you can determine through the substance of those initial conversations whether you&#8217;re on a serious pathway or not.&nbsp; But we&#8217;re not even at step one yet.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why do you think they haven’t?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are there preconditions for them getting vaccines from you?</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; I’m sorry?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are there preconditions for them getting vaccines from you?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; No.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why do you think they haven&#8217;t engaged while they were engaged so much with the Trump administration?</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; They go through cycles where they respond and cycles where they don&#8217;t.&nbsp; We&#8217;re in a cycle where they&#8217;re not.&nbsp; That&#8217;s been true across multiple administrations.&nbsp; And I just can&#8217;t speculate as to the rationale for them not (inaudible).</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s about this president versus that president?&nbsp; You think it&#8217;s just sort of a cycle that&#8217;s outside of that?</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; I mean, every previous president going back to Bush &#8212; so Bush, Obama, Trump &#8212; faced a nuclear test.&nbsp; We haven&#8217;t yet.&nbsp; We anticipate we may.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Each one of them faced missile tests; each one of them worked on a diplomatic approach.&nbsp; And at various points during each of those presidencies, the North Koreans were forthcoming, and at various points during each of those presidencies, they weren&#8217;t.</p>



<p>And so you could ask the question: Why hasn&#8217;t there been a nuclear te- &#8212; why wasn&#8217;t there a nuclear test in the first year when there was for these other presidents?&nbsp; And I don&#8217;t think it has so much to do with who&#8217;s in the Oval Office as their own rhythms and cadences.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But I just violated my own rule and started speculating about their motives &#8212; (laughter) &#8212; so I&#8217;ll stop.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Ukraine, can you talk about when the first shipments of weapons from this new package will arrive, or when you&#8217;re expecting them to go out?&nbsp; What&#8217;s going to be in there?&nbsp; Anything new?&nbsp; And do you have anything on these &#8212;</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; When you’re saying “this new package,” do you mean the next &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The one he just signed yesterday.</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; Oh, the $40 billion.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 40.</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; So we expect him &#8212; so the way that it works is a portion of that $40 billion is drawdown authority.&nbsp; So Secretary of Defense and Secretary of State have to make a recommendation to the President of a drawdown package.&nbsp; They are actively working through that now.&nbsp; We expect it&#8217;ll come up to the President in the next couple of days for him to then be able to move out on.&nbsp; But we are on the receiving end of that based on the law and the process.&nbsp; So I would also go to the Pentagon and State to ask them, okay, you know, when &#8212; when are they going to push it forward.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And what’s the latest, you guys believe, on what&#8217;s happening on the ground in Ukraine?&nbsp; And do you have anything on the high-ranking commanders being fired in the Russian forces?</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; No.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then what about that allegation from the Russian Defense Ministry that they destroyed a large batch of Western weapons from the U.S. and &#8212; and the Europeans?&nbsp; Is that &#8212; is that true?&nbsp; Do we think that they really did destroy a lot of weapons?&nbsp; I saw Ukraine was confirming it, but anything you can share?</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; I have nothing to validate it and haven&#8217;t had the opportunity to consult with the Ukrainians on it.&nbsp; What I can say is that, you know, we have what we believe to be a diverse and resilient supply chain for these weapons into Ukraine.&nbsp; So even if there is a circumstance where the Russians are able to target and hit some shipment on the ground in Ukraine, that&#8217;s not going to fundamentally, from a strategic perspective, disrupt the military assistance we&#8217;re providing.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What can you tell us about how John Kirby is coming over?&nbsp; How did that all come together?&nbsp; And can you describe what his role will be and how often we&#8217;ll see him in the briefing room?</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; So, John Kirby, as you all know, is a very effective national security voice and advocate for the President&#8217;s policies.&nbsp; Actually, you know, I think a good partner to you all.&nbsp; So we&#8217;re excited to have him at the White House.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I&#8217;m particularly excited to have him at the NSC, because having a senior voice who can come do these gaggles instead of me will just be awesome.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; No, I&#8217;m joking.&nbsp; I&#8217;m joking.</p>



<p>No, but &#8212; but otherwise, we&#8217;ll work out how it&#8217;s all going to play out in practice.&nbsp; The key thing is that John, at a moment when we&#8217;re dealing with a series of really critical national security issues, is just going to bring a great wealth of experience.&nbsp; And he&#8217;s going to be fun to work with for me; he’ll be fun to work with for the entire press team as well.</p>



<p>Q    There was reporting that he would basically fill the same role that Ben Rhodes did near the end of the Obama administration.  Is that sort of how you guys are seeing the role, or is it going to be different?</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; The thing about describing models like that &#8212; the “Ben Rhodes model” &#8212; they tend to be unique to an individual.&nbsp; And Ben, who is a very good friend of mine, is a unique individual and served in a unique capacity to President Obama.<br><br>John Kirby will have the &#8220;John Kirby model&#8221; of the role of Coordinator for Strategic Communications at the NSC.&nbsp; And he&#8217;ll shape it based on his own, kind of, capabilities, the relationship he builds with the President and the rest of the team.&nbsp; And so I &#8212; I think the comparisons tend &#8212; tend not to illuminate.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All right.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Appreciate it.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you so much.<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; We&#8217;re landing, guys.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Thanks, guys.&nbsp; Thanks, guys.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karine, is there a reason why Biden didn’t sign the aid bill on camera &#8212; the Ukraine aid package?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; I think he just wanted to sign it very quickly.&nbsp; And that was the &#8212; that was just the &#8212; we&#8217;ve always said: Once he got the bills, he would sign it quickly.&nbsp; And once the &#8212; once he was done with his event yesterday, he was able to do that.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There&#8217;s been some questions about whether or not it had to be flown over.&nbsp; What&#8217;s your understanding of why it was flown over to sign?<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Well, so that we can actually have the &#8211;the original copy for him to sign it.&nbsp; So, what happened was &#8212; and I think we&#8217;ve shared this with all of you &#8212; there was a &#8212; a staffer who was already scheduled to be here.&nbsp; And so, it came &#8212; it came with that staffer and was delivered to the President to sign.&nbsp; Yeah, there&#8217;s nothing &#8212; you know, there&#8217;s nothing really more to it.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karine, now that the DPA has been invoked and the actions that you listed at the top for baby formula, can you say when parents in the U.S. who are trying to get baby formula will be able to readily, you know, get baby formula?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Look, you know, the President &#8212; you know, you&#8217;ve heard us say this: The President understands the struggle of moms and dads and parents and caregivers and making sure that &#8212; you know, making sure that we get &#8212; a child has, you know, a healthy &#8212; a healthy &#8212; a healthy way of eating.&nbsp; A healthy formula is &#8212; and safe &#8212; and safe formula &#8212; is our number one priority, which is why we&#8217;re &#8212; you know, which is why we have been very, very acutely aware of &#8212; of the process that we&#8217;ve initiated with the flyover and also the DPA.<br><br>I don&#8217;t have a timeline for you yet.&nbsp; We want to exp- &#8212; you know, make sure it goes very quickly, because it&#8217;s so critical.&nbsp; And we know what &#8212; what families are going through.&nbsp; I &#8212; but I don&#8217;t have an exact timeline.&nbsp; Clear- &#8212; clearly, we want this to happen as fast as possible, as quickly as possible.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there a reason, also, that the administration isn&#8217;t seeking a stay in the Title 42 case?&nbsp; I know that you&#8217;re appealing.<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; We’re appealing.&nbsp; I mean, I don&#8217;t have much more than &#8212; than what the DOJ is doing is appealing Title 42.<br><br>You know, we continue to believe Title 42 is a health authority.&nbsp; It is an authority that CDC is &#8212; has that was given to them by Congress.&nbsp; And so that is kind of what we also agree with, which is the authority that Congress gave them.<br><br>Yep.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let’s let you get to your seat.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Karine.&nbsp; Appreciate it.&nbsp; Thanks a lot.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.<br><br>5:02 P.M. JST</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Osan Air Base<br>Pyeongtaek, Republic of Korea</p>



<p>1:52 P.M. KST</p>



<p>PRESIDENT BIDEN:&nbsp; First of all, I want to say thank you.&nbsp; And I wish you’d work on your biceps a little bit.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; And you too, pal.&nbsp; It’s about as big as my thighs.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; And I was a pretty good athlete.&nbsp; And I &#8212; I’m worried about you, Captain.&nbsp; I don’t know.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I &#8212; first of all, it’s great to be here with the President.&nbsp; We had a &#8212; we’ve had great meetings thus far.&nbsp; We had a great state dinner last night as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And &#8212; and I want to say what I’m sure the President thinks as well: Thank you.&nbsp; Thank you to all of you &#8212; every one of you.&nbsp; You are &#8212; you are the frontline of everything we’re concerned about.&nbsp; You represent the commitment of our two countries made to each other and the strength of the U.S.-ROK alliance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And our alliance &#8212; our alliance was formed through shared sacrifice of the Korean War.&nbsp; And now, seven decades later, thanks to you, the Republic of Korea is a strong, thriving, and innovating democracy.&nbsp; And our alliance grows stronger every single day because of you all.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And today, Korean and American forces stand sentinel still to &#8212; the integration and coordination between our forces is essential as it was yesterday and 10 years ago and 20 years ago and 40 years ago, et cetera.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The fact is that deterring threats and underwriting stability is as vital today for not only the Peninsula but for the world &#8212; for the world.&nbsp; That’s what the President and I spent the last couple of days talking about.&nbsp; It’s not just the Korean Peninsula, it’s the world.&nbsp; And so &#8212;</p>



<p>Should I stop and have that translated?&nbsp; (Laughter.)</p>



<p>(A translation is provided.)</p>



<p>The connections that you form serving together &#8212; not just as fellow service members, but as friends &#8212; helps knit our two nations together.</p>



<p>To all the American troops that are here and your families: Thank you for what you do to defend our country and our ally, and for representing our country so very well.</p>



<p>And to the Korean forces: Thank you as well for your service, for having our backs just as we have yours.&nbsp; I won’t attempt the Korean, but we &#8212; we &#8212; we’re &#8212; we go together, and we go together well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I’ve been impressed.&nbsp; Thank you so very much.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, by the way, we go together.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>PRESIDENT YOON:&nbsp; (As interpreted.)&nbsp; It is an honor and pleasure to visit Osan Air Base with President Biden today.&nbsp; In particular, as the President of the Republic of Korea, I am deeply grateful to all U.S. airmen, airwomen, and also Korean Air Force soldiers for their service and devotion to defend the peace and prosperity on the Korean Peninsula, and also to your families who are waiting for you across the Pacific Ocean.</p>



<p>I believe that friendship between the U.S. soldiers and officers and also with the Korean soldiers and officer is the real strength and power of ROK-U.S. alliance.<br><br>Since the outbreak of the Korean War, President Truman ordered to deploy U.S. forces to Korea just five days after the war.&nbsp; And the place near Osan Air Base was the very first place to be deployed, which the Smith Task Force was deployed and engaged for the first time with the DPRK forces at the Battle of Osan.<br><br>After the Korean War, the U.S. forces started to run air base in Osan.&nbsp; And also, soon after, Korea also made its command.<br><br>I believe that KAOC is the center &#8212; critical center to together respond to the DPRK’s increasing nuclear and missile threat, and also a symbol of the robust ROK-U.S. alliance.<br><br>I believe that I would like to show my deepest respect and extend my gratitude to all of you for your service protecting world peace and freedom and for your patriotism.<br><br>Thank you very much.</p>



<p>And I would like to note, with appreciation, that KAOC as the center of Korea&#8217;s three-pillar system to defend the North Korean missile threat.&nbsp; And I would like to mention the importance of your role and responsibility to defend the security of this Peninsula.<br><br>And today, I&#8217;m really &#8212; I am delighted to be here with President Biden.&nbsp; And I really feel assured, seeing you today, as the center of our defense.&nbsp; I would like to once again extend my deepest gratitude to you.<br><br>Thank you.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>2:10 P.M. KST</p>
