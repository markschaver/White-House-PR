<p class="has-text-align-center">James S. Brady Press Briefing Room</p>



<p>12:20 P.M. EST<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Hi, everyone.&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; I know also there&#8217;s a time limitation today, so we will make sure everybody is where they need to be when they need to be there.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Good morning.&nbsp; I just wanted to note at the top: I&#8217;m wearing red today in honor of National Wear Red Day and American Heart Month.<br>&nbsp;<br>Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, claiming the lives of 650,000 people every year, with a disproportionate burden on communities of color.<br>&nbsp;<br>The President is committed to supporting Americans in their efforts to achieve better heart health and closing the racial gaps in cardiovascular disease.&nbsp; That’s why we’re taking a whole-of-government approach to reduce diet-related chronic diseases and encourage every American to live a healthy lifestyle.<br>&nbsp;<br>The President has also called on Congress to launch his ARPA-H initiative, which would invest billions of dollars in preventing, detecting, and treating cancer, cardiovascular conditions, and other deadly diseases.<br>&nbsp;<br>And there are a number of other red-wearers today in here, too.&nbsp; I don’t want to &#8212; I don’t want to speak to what you picked out of your closet, but maybe you&#8217;re recognizing the same thing.&nbsp;<br> <br>Also wanted to note that a new competition and supply chain announcement that came out today &#8212; yesterday, I should say &#8212; sorry &#8212; from the Justice Department and the U.S. Department of Agriculture.&nbsp; They launched FarmerFairness.gov &#8212; a new online tool that gives farmers and ranchers a one-stop shop for reporting potentially illegal practices in agricultural markets.<br>&nbsp;<br>As the President noted when he met with farmers and ranchers last month, the meat-processing industry is highly consolidated.&nbsp; Just four companies control most of the markets for beef, poultry, and pork.&nbsp; That gives meat processors enormous power over farmers and ranchers.&nbsp; And too often, they use that power to exploit and underpay them.<br>&nbsp;<br>The launch of this new tool is a critical part of the Biden-Harris administration’s Action Plan for a Fairer, More Competitive, and More Resilient Meat and Poultry Supply Chain.<br>&nbsp;<br>This is a one-stop shop to report potential violations, and it will allow the Justice Department and the USDA to better address anticompetitive actions and create meat and poultry markets that are fairer to American farmers and ranchers.<br>&nbsp;<br>Finally, wanted to note this &#8212; shortly, the President will sign an executive order to improve timeliness, lower costs, and increase quality in federal construction projects.&nbsp; The order presumptive &#8212; requires the use of project labor agreements on federal construction projects, which will help the management and coordination challenges that can stymie progress on major construction projects.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Federal construction projects span the country, as we all know, from the maintenance of nuclear sites, to the upkeep at our military bases, to waterways and flood projects.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Based on the FY2021 figures, the order could affect $262 billion in federal government construction contracting and improve job quality for near &#8212; for the nearly 200,000 workers on federal construction contracts.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Additionally, as directly in the previous executive order, starting January 30th, federal contractors will be paid a $15 minimum wage.<br>&nbsp;<br>And briefly, the week ahead &#8212; last thing: On Monday, as you all know, the President Biden will welcome the Chancellor of Germany to the White House, Chancellor Scholz.&nbsp; They will affirm the deep and enduring ties with &#8212; between the United States and Germany, and discuss their shared commitment to ongoing diplomacy and joint efforts to deter further Russian aggression against Ukraine.<br>&nbsp;<br>They will also discuss our close cooperation on everything from COVID-19 &#8212; the COVID-19 pandemic to addressing the threat of climate change and promoting international security based on our shared democratic values.<br>&nbsp;<br>They will then participate in a joint press availability following the bilateral meeting.<br>&nbsp;<br>On Tuesday and Wednesday, the President will participate in events at the White House, providing updates on his economic plan to lower costs for the American people and create more good-paying jobs.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And on Thursday, he will travel to continue promoting his agenda.&nbsp; I expect we&#8217;ll have more details on that in the coming days.<br>&nbsp;<br>Go ahead.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; So yesterday, you and State Department Spokesman Ned Price both took issue with reporters asking for evidence of your statements with respect to the Syria strike and the Russian false-flag operation.&nbsp; Do you really believe that journalists are repeating Russian and Islamic State propaganda in pursuing those questions, first of all?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And second of all, will you be offering evidence of your claims with respect to what happened in Syria when they become available?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Absolutely.&nbsp; And I will &#8212; let me just start by saying that we welcome tough questions and good-faith scrutiny, otherwise I wouldn&#8217;t come out here &#8212; I wouldn&#8217;t have come out here almost 180 times and engaged with all of you and your tough questions and good-faith scrutiny.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>As I noted in the response to a question from your colleague yesterday, which wasn&#8217;t in all of the context of what was put out there, we are less than 48 hours from the end of the mission, so the Department of Defense is still conducting after-action assessments.&nbsp; That&#8217;s a natural part of the process that occurs.<br>&nbsp;<br>I also conveyed in my answer to the question: The President directed his Department of Defense to take every precaution to minimize civilian casualties and that we would release all of the information we could.&nbsp; And we absolutely remain committed to that, to answer the other part of your question.<br>&nbsp;<br>While I did not go into this level of detail during the plane gaggle, we also did a number of briefings a number of you participated in yesterday to brief out a number of the specific details, including the fact that we sent out special operators, at significant risk to themselves, to minimize the risk of civilian casualties.<br>&nbsp;<br>Of course, that&#8217;s different than doing a strike, which would not be as much risk to individuals involved.&nbsp; But obviously, these individuals were on the ground for a couple of hours, as we briefed out.&nbsp; It would have been easier to do an airstrike.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>But as a result, we have firsthand reports from our elite service members who are on the ground and risked their lives to kill a terrorist responsible to &#8212; for the slaughter and enslavement of the Yazidi religious minority in the north &#8212; in Northwestern Iraq in 2014, who bears responsibility for a recent set of attacks against the Iraqi Security Forces &#8212; and who took a terrorist off the battlefield who seeks to harm Americans.<br>&nbsp;<br>But of course, we respect and value the role of the press &#8212; otherwise, again, I wouldn&#8217;t be out here with all of you every day &#8212; and welcome the scrutiny, welcome to tough questioning.&nbsp; And as I said yesterday, of course we will do everything we can to provide as many details as possible.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>But I think it&#8217;s important, as people are trying to understand this, to note it is different having operators on the ground than an airstrike where it&#8217;s a different assessment after action.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then on the jobs report, both administration officials and outside experts expected a worse jobs report than we saw.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you have any sense of why those expectations were off and what exactly that means for your future, sort of, policy with respect to the recovery and the economy?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, what is also true: As much as we had a very encouraging jobs report today and as we look back to the revisions made as a part of the report this morning, the largest year of economic &#8212; of job creation ever in American history.<br>&nbsp;<br>Those are certainly things we are proud of, the President is proud of, and we attribute that in part to the actions he took to implement a number of important policies.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>It is also true &#8212; and this is one of the step &#8212; one of the facts that we have been pointing out over the course of last couple of days &#8212; that Omicron forced around 8 million people to take time off of work.&nbsp; And that was during a period of time where it was measured.&nbsp; So, that is also true.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, some of these people who were sick were not &#8212; would not have been counted in these job numbers.&nbsp; And that was a fact we just wanted people to understand as we were leading up to the jobs report.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is also clear that it’s very challenging to collect, analyze, adjust the data during this time of the pandemic.&nbsp; We are very grateful to the BLS team that does that.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s just incredibly challenging during an ongoing pandemic.&nbsp; But we think they&#8217;ve continued to deliver timely information.&nbsp; They&#8217;ve obviously continued to provide updates on a monthly basis when the &#8212; when their assessments change.<br>&nbsp;<br>Go ahead.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; President Xi and Putin met on &#8212; today, I guess &#8212; and released a pretty lengthy statement after that meeting.<br>&nbsp;<br>Just moving a little bit further back from the meeting itself, how does the President view the relationship between China, Russia &#8212; Xi and Putin &#8212; through the lens of his broader foreign policy goals, agenda items, relationships?&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, we &#8212; the President views it &#8212; views it as we have our own relationship with China.&nbsp; Secretary Blinken spoke to China&#8217;s Foreign Minister Wang and underscored &#8212; just recently, last week &#8212; and underscored the global security and economic risks posed by further Russian aggression against Ukraine, and conveyed that de-escalation and diplomacy are the responsible way forward.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We&#8217;ve also conveyed that destable- &#8212; a destabilizing conflict in Europe would impact China&#8217;s interests all over the world.&nbsp; And certainly, China should know that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, certainly, we have our own relationship where we engage directly at a very high level, as you all know, but our focus right now is continuing to unite with Allies and partners to respond decisively if Russia further invades Ukraine.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are there any concerns about that relationship &#8212; if it gets closer, if it becomes more intertwined &#8212; in terms of U.S. posture and role in geopolitical spheres?&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, again, what we have control over is our own relationships and the projection of our own values, and also looking for ways to work with countries, even where we disagree, and that is part of diplomacy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would note that &#8212; because some of the reporting has accurately assessed or, you know, raised the question of what took place in these conversations &#8212; we don&#8217;t have anything to update on that, I don&#8217;t think you would expect.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the size and the scope of economic measures on the table that we&#8217;re talking about, as it relates to Russian aggression or the potential of invasion, are unprecedented; would pose massive consequences for the Kremlin; and the inputs to &#8212; and I think it&#8217;s important for people to understand that the inputs to the major foundational technologies of the world still come from the West.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so, there&#8217;s an enormous amount of power we have as we work to continue to strengthen our diplomatic efforts with our partners around the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And just one more quick one.&nbsp; And obviously, I&#8217;m not going to try and repeat what Matt did yesterday with Ned, because I know you’ve experienced it times in a past life.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But when it comes to &#8212;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I do.&nbsp; I do.&nbsp; I had many engagements with Matt Lee in my time.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The idea though &#8212; and you&#8217;ve done this a couple times of times &#8212; and the British have, to some degree, as well &#8212; of getting out in front.<br>&nbsp;<br>I think almost giving insight into intelligence that perhaps past administrations, including past Democratic administrations, would not have done.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you explain, kind of, the thinking in that, strategically, and why you guys have decided to get out front on these types of things in this moment in time?&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure. &nbsp;So, over the past several months, we &#8212; but also a number of our Allies &#8212; have developed a significant amount of credible intelligence about Russian efforts to use a false pretext to justify an invasion of Ukraine.&nbsp; And this evidence mirrors both public reporting and Russian accounts in past conflicts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I would note: A number of your outlets, obviously, have reporters on the ground &#8212; right? &#8212; who are seeing for themselves what is happening.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is also true that &#8212; is that we&#8217;ve seen Russians&#8217; acti- &#8212; the Russians&#8217; actions &#8212; Russians&#8217; actions &#8212; over the past few years.&nbsp; You know, if you look just back at past precedent, it doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s guaranteed to repeat, but it is &#8212; it is important for people to understand contextually what they&#8217;re capable of and what tactics they&#8217;ve used in the past.&nbsp; And sometimes you see &#8212; you do see repetition of that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, a few years ago, for example, Russia&#8217;s Defense Ministry falsely claim- &#8212; accused the United States of running a clandestine biological weapons lab in the country of Georgia, enabling Russia&#8217;s efforts to destabilize the Georgian government.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Russia also used to fabricate stories in Syria about how attacks on international aid convoys were undertaken by rebels or terrorist, instead of the Assad regime, to enable Russia&#8217;s continued support for the Assad government.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you look back at 2016, the Russian media manufactured a false claim of sexual assault against a Russian émigré named Lisa by German refugees in order to stoke hysteria against Syrian immigrants throughout Europe.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And there&#8217;s more.&nbsp; Russian state television aired a false report that claimed the Ukrainian army had crucified a three-year-old Ukrainian Boy.&nbsp; That is even more recently.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, our objective is to deny Russia the opportunity to use these lies to justify an invasion of Ukraine and to convey clearly these are actions we&#8217;re seeing that are straight out of their playbook.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve seen them run false-flag operations in the past and use confusion to launch military action many times in history.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, we would prefer to make as much underlying information available as we can.&nbsp; And in fact, the &#8212; what we conveyed yesterday and was conveyed by my colleagues at the Defense Department and State Department was a result of declassifying information.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We can&#8217;t do &#8212; there are limitations because of compromising intelligence sources and methods.&nbsp; But what we&#8217;re trying to do is take steps to deny Russia the opportunity to use lies, to use past tactics to justify an invasion of Ukraine, essentially, to avoid war.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Go ahead.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; If Putin decides to make a move into Ukraine, how long does the U.S. believe that the Ukrainians could hold off a full Russian takeover?&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Jacqui, it&#8217;s a great question.&nbsp; I would really point you to the Department of Defense to make any assessment, if they can.&nbsp; And obviously, some assessments they might not be in a position to make publicly.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That they would not want to share publicly or that they don&#8217;t know?&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Again, I&#8217;m just conveying that there are some assessments and, obviously, you &#8212; the Department of Defense does a range of contingency planning.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll let them speak for themselves on what they could &#8212; what they could lay out publicly for you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; And then, we&#8217;ve known about the reality of this threat since October.&nbsp; Putin began amassing troops on the border in April.&nbsp; So, why have we waited so long to send the kind of aid that we&#8217;re seeing now?&nbsp; Why haven&#8217;t we sent, for instance, anti-aircraft weaponry?&nbsp; Because if Russia does an airstrike, wouldn&#8217;t they be able to obliterate what we&#8217;ve sent to them so far?&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, remember, the President met with President Zelenskyy back in &#8212; I think it was September, but you can correct me if that&#8217;s wrong; it was sometime early in the fall &#8212; and committed to a large aid package.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is something that we&#8217;ve been implementing and delivering since that point in time.&nbsp; So, actually, it&#8217;s been continuous security assistance that we&#8217;ve been providing to the Ukrainians &#8212; an enormous package that we&#8217;ve been providing over the course of the last year.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>In terms of weapon systems, I’d again point you to the Department of Defense.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So the feeling within the administration is that we have responded in a timely manner to Ukraine&#8217;s concerns?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I think what&#8217;s important for people to understand is that this has been continuous.&nbsp; It wasn&#8217;t that we had never provided aid, whether it&#8217;s humanitarian or security assistance, and all of a sudden we did recently.&nbsp; We &#8212; that has been a continuous process.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve provided hundreds of billions of dollars in aid, security assistance over the course of not just the last year, but long before that, and including a commitment the President made and was announced around President Zelenskyy’s visit.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, moving on to energy: I mean, gas prices are at a seven-year high here in the U.S. right after OPEC, again, snubbed requests to increase production.&nbsp; And then there&#8217;s this energy crisis in Western Europe brewing.&nbsp; Is there any point where the President would consider opening up domestic production in order to mitigate some of this?&nbsp; The inflation and, you know, assist our allies in Western Europe?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, there&#8217;s a couple of important questions you raised there.&nbsp; Let me start by saying that, as it relates to Europe and the shortage &#8212; or potential, I should say &#8212; it doesn&#8217;t exist currently.&nbsp; Everybody is experiencing high gas prices, but I think you&#8217;re asking as it relates to a potential invasion.&nbsp; That is something we&#8217;ve been very mindful of and in touch with our European partners and also suppliers about what can be done and how we can ensure or take steps to increase capacity out there to meet those needs, should they raise; some of them is natural gas, some of them is gas, as you know.&nbsp; So, that is something we&#8217;ve been quite mindful of.<br>&nbsp;<br>I&#8217;d also note that the President has been &#8212; has taken a number of steps in recent months to address the gas prices, including tapping the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, of course conveying clearly to OPEC member countries and suppliers that it&#8217;s important to meet the demand on the market.&nbsp; And we&#8217;ll continue to &#8212; to look at options that can be done to lower gas prices for the American people.<br>&nbsp;<br>In terms of whether or not there could be more oil drilling, you know, I&#8217;d point you to the oil companies on what available places they have and if they&#8217;re maximizing that.&nbsp; My understanding is they’re not.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there any consideration for increasing, for instance, LNG export licenses?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; You know, I don&#8217;t have anything to preview for you in terms of additional steps.&nbsp; I can &#8212; can just reiterate to you that the President raises and talks about the importance of taking every step we can to lower gas prices for the American people.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then real quick on the Johns Hopkins study on the lockdowns.&nbsp; It was this meta-analysis that came out of several studies.&nbsp; Lockdowns during the first wave of COVID in the spring of 2020 found that it only reduced COVID mortality by 0.2 percent in the U.S. and Europe, and suggested that they have little to no public health benefit but severe consequences for the economy.&nbsp; And it suggests that lockdowns shouldn&#8217;t be a part of a future pandemic response.&nbsp; Is that the shared view of the administration looking in the rearview mirror?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would say &#8212; I would, sort of, first, of course, point to our health and medical experts for specifics on this specific &#8212; scientific study.<br>&nbsp;<br>I would note that the President has been clear we&#8217;re not pushing lockdowns; we&#8217;ve not been pro-lockdown.&nbsp; That has not been his agenda.&nbsp; Most of the lockdowns actually happened under the previous president.<br>&nbsp;<br>What our objective has been is to &#8212; conveying that we have the tools we need to keep our country open, thanks to the President&#8217;s leadership, and focus on fighting the virus.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s reflected in the fact that 98 percent of schools are open, over 210 million Americans are fully vaccinated.&nbsp; We have the tools to avoid lockdowns, and we&#8217;re not moving back.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s our intention at this point.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, you guys do believe then that the lockdowns were more harmful than helpful?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Again, I would point you to our scientific experts on the specifics of a study.&nbsp; But the President&#8217;s agenda, the President&#8217;s approach has not been lockdowns.&nbsp; It has been using the tools we have to prevent that.<br>&nbsp;<br>Go ahead.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the Supreme Court nomination, Senator Ben Ray Luján’s office is saying, today, he&#8217;s going to be out for four to six weeks.&nbsp; I know you&#8217;ve obviously wished him well.&nbsp; Hopefully it’s shorter than that.&nbsp; But, you know, sometimes these recoveries don’t always go as planned.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So, is the White House thinking at all about timing, given the senator’s potential absence?&nbsp; Is that affecting at all how the President is now thinking about this nomination versus how he would have been thinking about it a week ago?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; No.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay, so everything is still on track for a pick by the end of February?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I know you&#8217;ve been asked before whether the President is considering Republican votes and whether he can get any Republicans on board.&nbsp; Is the response still: “The President is looking for the best candidate and not thinking about which votes that candidate can get”?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah, but I would say it’s important to note that the President’s commitment, above all else, is to nominate a qualified woman &#8212; a Black woman &#8212; to serve on the Supreme Court with impeccable credentials.&nbsp; And he thinks anyone he chooses should have the kind of credentials and be as &#8212; and be so qualified that they should be considered by Democrats and Republicans.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, just a couple things on COVID: We&#8217;ve hit the 900,000 death mark, or we&#8217;re quickly going to approach it depending on your tally, but is the President going to do anything to mark this &#8212; for the grim milestone of 900,000 deaths?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We will have more on this soon, but I don&#8217;t have anything to preview today.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Do you have any updates on the testing efforts &#8212; the shipping out of the free COVID tests?&nbsp; How many have there been shipped out now?&nbsp; Do you have an update on that?&nbsp; Are they still being shipped out every 7 to 12 days from the order?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; So, I don&#8217;t have an update on numbers.&nbsp; It&#8217;s changing constantly.&nbsp; I know we confirmed &#8212; I think it was last Friday, so I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s changed since then &#8212; that we had about 60 million orders.&nbsp; And we had sent out tens of millions of tests.&nbsp; And you’ve certainly seen on social media people receiving their tests, which is always good news.&nbsp; But I don&#8217;t have &#8212; I don’t have an update on that.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And this program, of course, is just beginning to ramp up.&nbsp; We&#8217;d said at the beginning we wouldn&#8217;t start sending tests until the end of January.&nbsp; We obviously did it ahead of time.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>But what we&#8217;re really relying on right now is as soon as testing manufacturers deliver tests to the U.S. government, we will get them out to the American people.&nbsp; And the Postal Service is doing their job packing and shipping efficiently.&nbsp; And I expect we&#8217;ll have more updates in due time &#8212; a short time, I hope.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And just a real quick one on Russia.&nbsp; The Senate has left town without passing a sanctions bill.&nbsp; How important does the White House think it is to get the Senate to pass a Russian sanctions bill?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, we&#8217;re in close touch with them.&nbsp; But I &#8212; it&#8217;s not essential for us to implement sanctions.&nbsp; Right?&nbsp; It&#8217;s not required.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And so, we have had &#8212; we have prepared a devastating package of sanctions &#8212; economic sanctions that would have an enormous impact on the Russian economy.&nbsp; It doesn&#8217;t require congressional action, but we are, of course, working closely with them.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, we need to gather.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Oh, okay.&nbsp; Sorry for it to be so short today.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll be around for a little bit.&nbsp; If people have questions, come on by.<br>&nbsp;<br>Thanks, everyone.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, can you say anything about the Russian oil deal with China?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t think I have any additional comments about their meeting.&nbsp; I will see if there&#8217;s more we can offer.&nbsp; I&#8217;m happy to do that for you, Andrea.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Would that undermine any potential U.S. sanctions?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I’m happy to get back to you if there’s more we can offer, Andrea.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>12:41 P.M. EST</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act, 40 U.S.C. 101 <em>et seq.</em>, and in order to promote economy and efficiency in the administration and completion of Federal construction projects, it is hereby ordered that:</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Section 1. &nbsp;Policy.</span> &nbsp;(a) &nbsp;Large-scale construction projects pose special challenges to efficient and timely procurement by the Federal Government.&nbsp; Construction employers typically do not have a permanent workforce, which makes it difficult to predict labor costs when bidding on contracts and to ensure a steady supply of labor on contracts being performed.&nbsp; Challenges also arise because construction projects typically involve multiple employers at a single location, and a labor dispute involving one employer can delay the entire project.&nbsp; A lack of coordination among various employers, or uncertainty about the terms and conditions of employment of various groups of workers, can create friction and disputes in the absence of an agreed-upon resolution mechanism. &nbsp;These problems threaten the efficient and timely completion of construction projects undertaken by Federal contractors. &nbsp;On large-scale projects, which are generally more complex and of longer duration, these problems tend to be more pronounced.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(b) &nbsp;Project labor agreements are often effective in preventing these problems from developing because they provide structure and stability to large-scale construction projects.&nbsp; Such agreements avoid labor-related disruptions on projects by using dispute-resolution processes to resolve worksite disputes and by prohibiting work stoppages, including strikes and lockouts.&nbsp; They secure the commitment of all stakeholders on a construction site that the project will proceed efficiently without unnecessary interruptions. &nbsp;They also advance the interests of project owners, contractors, and subcontractors, including small businesses.&nbsp; For these reasons, owners and contractors in both the public and private sector routinely use project labor agreements, thereby reducing uncertainties in large-scale construction projects.&nbsp; The use of project labor agreements is fully consistent with the promotion of small business interests.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(c) &nbsp;Accordingly, it is the policy of the Federal Government for agencies to use project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement.&nbsp;</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 2. &nbsp;Definitions.</span> &nbsp;For purposes of this order:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(a) &nbsp;&#8220;Labor organization&#8221; means a labor organization as defined in 29 U.S.C. 152(5) of which building and construction employees are members, as described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f).<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(b) &nbsp;&#8220;Construction&#8221; means construction, reconstruction, rehabilitation, modernization, alteration, conversion, extension, repair, or improvement of buildings, structures, highways, or other real property.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(c) &nbsp;&#8220;Large-scale construction project&#8221; means a Federal construction project within the United States for which the total estimated cost of the construction contract to the Federal Government is $35 million or more.&nbsp; The Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council (FAR Council), in consultation with the Council of Economic Advisers, may adjust this threshold based on inflation using the process at 41 U.S.C. 1908.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(d) &nbsp;&#8220;Agency&#8221; means an executive department or agency, including an independent establishment subject to the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act, 40 U.S.C. 102(4)(A).&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(e) &nbsp;&#8220;Project labor agreement&#8221; means a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f).&nbsp;</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 3.&nbsp; Project Labor Agreement Presumption.</span> Subject to sections 5 and 6 of this order,&nbsp;in awarding any contract in connection with a large-scale construction project, or obligating funds pursuant to such a contract, agencies shall require every contractor or subcontractor engaged in construction on the project to agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more appropriate labor organizations.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 4.&nbsp; Requirements of Project Labor Agreements.</span> Any project labor agreement reached pursuant to this order shall:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(a) &nbsp;bind all contractors and subcontractors on the construction project through the inclusion of appropriate specifications in all relevant solicitation provisions and contract documents;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(b) &nbsp;allow all contractors and subcontractors on the construction project to compete for contracts and subcontracts without regard to whether they are otherwise parties to collective bargaining agreements;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(c) &nbsp;contain guarantees against strikes, lockouts, and similar job disruptions;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(d) &nbsp;set forth effective, prompt, and mutually binding procedures for resolving labor disputes arising during the term of the project labor agreement;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(e) &nbsp;provide other mechanisms for labor-management cooperation on matters of mutual interest and concern, including productivity, quality of work, safety, and health; and<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(f) &nbsp;fully conform to all statutes, regulations, Executive Orders, and Presidential Memoranda.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 5.&nbsp; Exceptions Authorized by Agencies.</span> A senior official within an agency may grant an exception from the requirements of section 3 of this order for a particular contract by, no later than the solicitation date, providing a specific written explanation of why at least one of the following circumstances exists with respect to that contract:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(a) &nbsp;Requiring a project labor agreement on the project would not advance the Federal Government&#8217;s interests in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement.&nbsp;Such a finding shall be based on the following factors:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The project is of short duration and lacks operational complexity;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(ii)&nbsp; &nbsp;The project will involve only one craft or trade;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(iii) The project will involve specialized construction work that is available from only a limited number of contractors or subcontractors;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(iv) &nbsp;&nbsp;The agency&#8217;s need for the project is of such an unusual and compelling urgency that a project labor agreement would be impracticable; or<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(v) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The project implicates other similar factors deemed appropriate in regulations or guidance issued pursuant to section 8 of this order.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(b) &nbsp;Based on an inclusive market analysis, requiring a project labor agreement on the project would substantially reduce the number of potential bidders so as to frustrate full and open competition.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(c) &nbsp;Requiring a project labor agreement on the project would otherwise be inconsistent with statutes, regulations, Executive Orders, or Presidential Memoranda.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 6.  Reporting.</span> (a)  To the extent permitted by law and consistent with national security and executive branch confidentiality interests, agencies shall publish, on a centralized public website, data showing the use of project labor agreements on large-scale construction projects, as well as descriptions of the exceptions granted under section 5 of this order.<br>     (b)  On a quarterly basis, agencies shall report to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) on their use of project labor agreements on large-scale construction projects and on the exceptions granted under section 5 of this order.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 7.</span> Nothing in this order precludes an agency from requiring the use of a project labor agreement in circumstances not covered by this order, including projects where the total cost to the Federal Government is less than that for a large-scale construction project, or projects receiving any form of Federal financial assistance (including loans, loan guarantees, revolving funds, tax credits, tax credit bonds, and cooperative agreements).  This order also does not require contractors or subcontractors to enter into a project labor agreement with any particular labor organization.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 8.  Regulations and Implementation.</span> (a)  Within 120 days of the date of this order, the FAR Council, to the extent permitted by law, shall propose regulations implementing the provisions of this order.  The FAR Council shall consider and evaluate public comments on the proposed regulations and shall promptly issue a final rule, to the extent permitted by law.<br>     (b)  The Director of OMB shall, to the extent permitted by law, issue guidance to implement the requirements of sections 5 and 6 of this order.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 9.  Contracting Officer Training.</span> Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Labor, and the Director of OMB shall coordinate in designing a training strategy for agency contracting officers to enable those officers to effectively implement this order. Within 180 days of the date of the publication of proposed regulations, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Labor, and the Director of OMB shall provide a report to the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy and Director of the National Economic Council on the contents of the training strategy.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 10. Revocation of Prior Orders, Rules, and Regulations<em>.</em></span>  Executive Order 13502 of February 6, 2009 (Use of Project Labor Agreements for Federal Construction Projects), is revoked as of the effective date of the final regulations issued by the FAR Council under section 8(a) of this order. Upon Executive Order 13502&#8217;s revocation, the heads of agencies shall consider, to the extent permitted by law, revoking any orders, rules, or regulations implementing Executive Order 13502.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 11.  Severability.</span>  If any provision of this order, or the application of such provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this order and its application to any other person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 12. Effective Date<em>.</em></span><em> </em> This order shall be effective immediately and shall apply to all solicitations for contracts issued on or after the effective date of the final regulations issued by the FAR Council under section 8(a) of this order.  For solicitations issued between the date of this order and the effective date of the final regulations issued by the FAR Council under section 8(a) of this order, or solicitations that have already been issued and are outstanding as of the date of this order, agencies are strongly encouraged, to the extent permitted by law, to comply with this order.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 13. General Provisions<em>.</em></span>  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:<br>          (i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or<br>          (ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.<br>     (b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.<br>     (c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">State Dining Room</p>



<p>11:50 A.M. EST</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:  Hey, folks.  Good morning.  It’s still morning by about 10 minutes.  (Laughter.)  I want to speak to you this morning about the extraordinary resilience and grit of the American people and American capitalism.</p>



<p>Our country is taking everything that COVID has to throw at us, and we’ve come back stronger.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m pleased to report this morning what many of you already know: that America’s job machine is going stronger than ever, fueling a strong recovery and opportunity for hardworking women and men all across this great country.</p>



<p>America is back to work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today we learned that in January, our economy created 467,000 jobs.&nbsp;&nbsp; But that’s not all.&nbsp; We learned that job growth in November and December over last year was revised up by more than 700,000 jobs.&nbsp; On top of that, 400,000 jobs are previously &#8212; on top of the 400,000 that were previously reported.</p>



<p>This morning’s report caps off my first year as President.&nbsp; And over that period, our economy created 6.6 million jobs &#8212; 6.6 million jobs.</p>



<p>If you can’t remember another year when so many people went to work in this country, there’s a reason: It never happened.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Take a look at the chart.&nbsp; You can look at the last &#8212; all the way back to President Reagan.&nbsp; Look how many jobs we&#8217;ve created in &#8212; on average per month.&nbsp; This is &#8212; it’s never happened before.&nbsp; And, look, history has been made here.</p>



<p>But it comes alongside the largest drop in unemployment rate in a single year on record, the largest reduction in childhood poverty ever recorded in a single year, and the strongest economic growth this country has seen in nearly 40 years.&nbsp; Historic economic progress.</p>



<p>And I’m proud of the role the administration played in this economic plan and has played in the recovery: you know, the Rescue Plan that Democrats passed to get the economy going again; the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law that’s starting to get underway, rebuilding bridges, roads, highways, ports, airports, Internet, and so much more that we’re doing as well; and my decision at the outset of our administration to buy American.&nbsp; It’s always been the law; it was very seldom ever followed.&nbsp; Now it’s a reality, not an empty promise.</p>



<p>I made clear that when the federal government spends taxpayer dollars, we buy American products &#8212; American products made in America, including all the component parts of that product, with very few exceptions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With the support of the American private sector, our business leaders and entrepreneurs, our workers, our union leaders &#8212; they’ve all come together like never before in my days in Washington.</p>



<p>I know it hasn’t been easy.&nbsp; I know that January was a very hard month for many Americans.&nbsp; I know that after almost two years, the physical and emotional weight of the pandemic has been incredibly difficult to bear for so many people.</p>



<p>But here’s the good news: We have the tools to save lives and to keep businesses open and keep schools open, keep workers on the job, and sustain this historic economic comeback.&nbsp; Vaccination and boosters have proven incredibly effective.</p>



<p>This past month, we started mailing out tens of millions of at-home tests to deliver to your home for free so you can determine whether or not you have COVID.&nbsp; And that’s in addition to the 20,000 sites across America where you can get a test in person, for free, to determine whether or not you have COVID.</p>



<p>And we have more treatments today to keep people out of the hospital, including lifesaving antiviral pills, which we purchased millions of.</p>



<p>And now we’re seeing the difference our efforts have made.</p>



<p>Look at what’s happened: Just in the past three weeks, today’s extraordinary job report data was collected; the COVID crisis has been cut in half &#8212; down in half in just three weeks.&nbsp; Still too many cases, still we have to be on the &#8212; on the alert.&nbsp; But to be clear: This is a dramatic decline.</p>



<p>Now, I want to be clear: Even with the extraordinary news, even with historic economic progress we’ve made across the past year, we still have a lot of work to do.&nbsp; Making sure every American has a job is a great start, but it’s not the finish.</p>



<p>For many Americans, wages are up this year.&nbsp; In January, wage increases were strong across the board, and that’s good.&nbsp; We have to continue to keep wages growing.&nbsp; And we need even more high-paying jobs &#8212; jobs you can raise a family on and have some breathing room.</p>



<p>Two weeks ago, the CEO of Intel, Pat Gelsinger, came to the White House to announce a brand new $20 billion semiconductor factory &#8212; they call it a “campus” &#8212; outside of Columbus, Ohio.&nbsp; It’s going to create 7,000 jobs just constructing the facility and 3,000 permanent jobs running the facility, with an average salary of $135,000.</p>



<p>These semiconductors or microchips power virtually everything in our everyday lives, from our cellphones to automobiles to refrigerators, the Internet, the electric grid.&nbsp; Without semiconductors, these things do not function in a modern economy.</p>



<p>So, the spin-off of this is going to create thousands of additional jobs as well, helping us build more American products in manufacturing automobiles, appliances, and so much more.&nbsp; It’s going to create jobs, and it’s going to help ease inflation.</p>



<p>One of the reasons why automobiles cost so much money these days and they’re responsible for one third of all the inflation that’s calculated in a market is because they lack the semiconductors to build the vehicles.</p>



<p>Intel’s announcement helps us fix that problem.</p>



<p>Last week, I called a meeting of CEOs from General Motors, Ford, Microsoft, and other major corporations in America.</p>



<p>Mary Barra of General Motors, the chairman of the board &#8212; the CEO, I should say &#8212; announced a $7 billion investment in a Michigan manufacturing plant to manufacture electric vehicles.&nbsp; It’s going to create 4,000 new, quality jobs at prevailing wage.</p>



<p>That’s on top of the announcement last year made by Ford’s CEO, Jim Farley, who was with us, to invest $11 billion to make electric vehicles, creating 11,000 new good-paying jobs.</p>



<p>Look, last Friday I went to Pittsburgh, where the Pacific &#8212; the Union Pacific Railroad announced the largest purchase of American battery-electric locomotives in history, built in Erie, Pennsylvania &#8212; built by American manufacturing workers in Western Pennsylvania, creating even more good-paying jobs.</p>



<p>And again, the spin-off from that: These locomotives aren’t just going to be purchased in America.  Countries around the world &#8212; because they’re going to be the best product &#8212; are going to purchase them &#8212; American-made electric vehicles made in Erie, Pennsylvania.  Good-paying jobs.</p>



<p>Look, we all know we’re in competition with the world.&nbsp; These announcements are the drumbeat a job &#8212; of a job resurgence unlike anything we’ve seen in our history.</p>



<p>And it didn’t happen by chance.&nbsp; It’s a result of the economic plan I put into action on day one when I said it’s going be “buy America.”&nbsp; I’m delighted to keep it going and expand what we’ve done, because we have a great opportunity ahead of us to further progress &#8212; make progress where &#8212; beyond what we’ve already made.</p>



<p>Look, the House of Representatives just passed, a few minutes ago &#8212; just before I walked over here &#8212; to provide $90 billion &#8212; over $90 billion &#8212; for research and development, manufacturing, and all those elements of the supply chain needed to produce end products right here in America, so we can keep delivering more announcements like the one we’ve had in these past few weeks.</p>



<p>Another way we’re boosting our economy is by promoting competition.</p>



<p>Look, a hamburger is, you know, up four times &#8212; four-fold almost in many places.&nbsp; Well, guess what?&nbsp; Meat processing, meat processors are &#8212; shipping, railroads, and other industries &#8212; are dominated by a few giant companies that control the market they operate in.</p>



<p>And over the years, this domination in the market by a smaller number of companies &#8212; smaller and smaller &#8212; it&#8217;s about four in the meatpacking area &#8212; has reduced competition; squeezed out small businesses and farmers; and, in many cases, increased prices &#8212; at almost all of them &#8212; increased prices for consumers.</p>



<p>Look, I’m a capitalist.&nbsp; But capitalism without competition is not capitalism; it’s exploitation.&nbsp; So, I’m going to continue to do everything in my power to work with the Congress to make our capitalist system work better, to provide more competition, and lower prices for American consumers.</p>



<p>And they’re still going to do well.&nbsp; But that isn’t going to be enough.&nbsp; We still need to ease the burden on working families by making everyday things more affordable and accessible.</p>



<p>Look, average people are getting clobbered by the cost of everything today.&nbsp; Gas prices at the pump are up.&nbsp; We’re working to bring them down, but they’re up.</p>



<p>Food prices are up.&nbsp; We’re working to bring them down as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Look, I grew up in a family where if the price for a gallon of gas at the pump went up significantly, it was felt by the family.&nbsp; I get it.&nbsp; I understand.&nbsp; But these things are necessities, but that’s not the totality of what the family needs.&nbsp; They still have to pay for childcare.&nbsp; They still have to pay for prescription drugs.&nbsp; They still have to pay for healthcare.</p>



<p>There’s more than one way to help a family when it comes to their standard of living.&nbsp; We’re going to work to bring down the prices that are way up, but guess what?&nbsp; Guess what?&nbsp; We’re going to keep strengthening the supply chains to bring down the costs of every &#8212; all of these goods.</p>



<p>But in the meantime, there is a lot we can do to give families a little extra breathing room.</p>



<p>For example, childcare.&nbsp; Families can spend $14,000 a year per child, in some cases in this country &#8212; in some cases less than $14,000 a year &#8212; for childcare.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our plan cuts in half most &#8212; what most families are paying, helping their budgets; helping &#8212; keeping millions of parents, and especially women, allowed to go back to work because they can get childcare.</p>



<p>Or the cost of prescription drugs, like insulin.&nbsp; Insulin costs about $10 to make.&nbsp; But for families who need the insulin, they’re paying up to $650 a month on average in some places and as high as $1,000 a month.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Think about all of those Americans out there with Type 1 diabetes who need this insulin to stay alive and stay healthy, or the 200,000 American children with Type 1 diabetes.</p>



<p>Think about being one of the parents without the insurance or the money to pay for that insulin.&nbsp; How do you look your child in the eye who needs that insulin?&nbsp; They have no idea how they’re going to figure out how to pay for it.</p>



<p>Think about what it does to them &#8212; to their self-esteem, their dignity, their ability to look their child in the eye.</p>



<p>We cap the cost of insulin at $35 on our plan &#8212; $35 a month.&nbsp; The companies are still going to make a healthy profit.&nbsp; We could do that tomorrow with the stroke of a pen.</p>



<p>But we have a generation of &#8212; so-called, for example, “sandwich generation.”&nbsp; That is you have a young child and an elderly parent who need &#8212; both need help.&nbsp; And look, we can help them take care of mom and dad and make it work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There’s a program that allows us to &#8212; on Medicare &#8212; that someone can come and install a handrail in the shower so mom doesn’t fall; to make sure they have what they need to live with safety and dignity in their home, pick up the prescriptions, make an occasional meal.&nbsp; We can do all that.</p>



<p>So when a mom and dad puts their head on the pillow at night, they can have peace of mind that their elderly parents are doing well and their children are okay.</p>



<p>We’re still going to work on gas prices.&nbsp; We’re still going to work on the food prices.&nbsp; But in the meantime, we can deliver that peace of &#8212; we can deliver that peace of mind to the American people and give them a little breathing room.</p>



<p>And, by the way, the proposals that I have out there &#8212; nobody earning less than $400,000 a year would pay a single additional penny in taxes.&nbsp; Not a single penny.&nbsp; And a lot of companies that I’ve spoken to are willing to pay a little more in their corporate taxes and their personal taxes to see that happen.</p>



<p>You’ve heard me say it a hundred times: You got 55 companies of the Fortune 500 companies that paid zero tax in the last couple years, and they made over $400 billion.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Look, we can do this without increasing the deficit.&nbsp; Actually, we’ve reduced the deficit over $300 billion.</p>



<p>And 17 Nobel laureates in economics came to me several months ago to say that this plan would not only not raise inflation, it would ease long-term inflationary pressures.</p>



<p>Look, the bottom line is this: The United States is once again in a position to not only compete with the rest of the world but outcompete the rest of the world once again.</p>



<p>If we can keep coming together and invest in the backbone of America &#8212; working class and the middle-class folks &#8212; there’s no limit to what we can achieve.</p>



<p>So let’s keep the rais- &#8212; the wages rising, and let’s start lowering costs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our businesses are the best in the world.&nbsp; Our workers are the best in the world.&nbsp; Give them half a chance and they’ll outcompete anyone, anywhere in the world.</p>



<p>We can have a quality of life for working people that they deserve at the same time.</p>



<p>And, by the way, the middle class, when it does well; when the working class does well &#8212; everybody does well.&nbsp; Everything is better for the wealthy, the super-wealthy, and the slightly wealthy.&nbsp; Nobody gets hurt.</p>



<p>So let’s face these challenges head on.&nbsp; Let’s keep building a better America.</p>



<p>I want to thank you.&nbsp; And God bless you, and may God protect our troops.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>

<p>The House took a critical vote today for stronger supply chains and lower prices, for more manufacturing – and good manufacturing jobs – right here in America, and for outcompeting China and the rest of the world in the 21st century. I applaud Speaker Pelosi, Majority Leader Hoyer, Whip Clyburn, and Chairwoman Eddie Bernice Johnson for their leadership in getting this done.</p>



<p>Business and labor alike have praised this legislation as vital for continuing the economic momentum we’ve seen over the last year, and national security leaders from both parties have said that the investments in this bill are needed if we want to maintain our competitive edge globally. This bill was built on numerous bipartisan elements and on shared bipartisan agreement on the need to act. If House Republicans are serious about lowering prices, making our economy stronger, and competing with China from a position of strength, then they should come to the table and support this legislation, which does just that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I look forward to the House and Senate quickly coming together to find a path forward and putting a bill on my desk as soon as possible for my signature. America can’t afford to wait.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.&nbsp; On January 23, 2018, pursuant to section 203 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the &#8220;Trade Act&#8221;) (19 U.S.C. 2253), the President issued Proclamation 9693, imposing a safeguard measure for a period of 4 years that included both a tariff-rate quota (TRQ) on imports of certain crystalline silicon photovoltaic (CSPV) cells, not partially or fully assembled into other products, provided for in subheading 8541.40.6025 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS), and an increase in duties (safeguard tariff) on imports of CSPV cells exceeding the TRQ and all imports of other CSPV products, including modules provided for in subheading 8541.40.6015 of the HTS.&nbsp; Proclamation 9693 exempted imports from certain designated beneficiary countries under the Generalized System of Preferences from the application of the safeguard measure.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.&nbsp; Clause (4) and Annex I of Proclamation 9693 directed the United States Trade Representative (USTR) to establish procedures for interested persons to request the exclusion of particular products from the safeguard measure.&nbsp; These provisions also authorized the USTR, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of Energy, to determine whether a particular product should be excluded, and, upon publication of a determination in the <em>Federal Register</em>, to modify the HTS to implement such determination.&nbsp; Furthermore, they authorized the USTR to modify or to terminate such determinations.&nbsp; Effective June 13, 2019, the USTR excluded bifacial solar panels that absorb light and generate electricity on each side of the panel and that consist of only bifacial solar cells that absorb light and generate electricity on both sides of the cells (bifacial modules).&nbsp; Exclusion of Particular Products From the Solar Products Safeguard Measure, 84 FR 27684 (June 13, 2019).<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.&nbsp; On February 7, 2020, the United States International Trade Commission (USITC) issued its report, pursuant to section&nbsp;204(a)(2) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2254(a)(2)), on the results of its monitoring of developments with respect to the domestic solar industry (USITC, Crystalline Silicon Photovoltaic Cells, Whether or Not Partially or Fully Assembled Into Other Products: &nbsp;Monitoring Developments in the Domestic Industry, No.&nbsp;TA-201-075 (Monitoring)).&nbsp; In its report, the USITC found that, following imposition of the safeguard measure, prices for CSPV&nbsp;cells and modules declined in a manner consistent with historical trends, but that prices were higher than they would have been without the safeguard measure.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.&nbsp; On March 6, 2020, the USITC issued an additional report&nbsp;pursuant to a request from the USTR under section&nbsp;204(a)(4) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2254(a)(4)), regarding the probable economic effect on the domestic CSPV cell and module manufacturing industry of modifying the safeguard measure to increase the level of the TRQ on CSPV cells from the current 2.5 gigawatts (GW) to 4.0, 5.0, or 6.0 GW (USITC, Crystalline Silicon Photovoltaic Cells, Whether or Not Partially or Fully Assembled Into Other Products: &nbsp;Advice on the Probable Economic Effect of Certain Modifications to the Safeguard Measure, No.&nbsp;TA-201-075 (Modification)). &nbsp;In its report, the USITC advised that increasing the TRQ would help to continue growth in solar module production, but that expanded access to imported cells not subject to safeguard duties would put downward pressure on prices for cells made in the United States.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.&nbsp; After taking into account the information provided in&nbsp;the USITC&#8217;s reports, and after receiving a petition from a&nbsp;majority of the representatives of the domestic industry with&nbsp;respect to each of the following modifications, and under section 204(b)(1)(B) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2254(b)(1)(B)), the President issued Proclamation 10101 on October 10, 2020, in which he determined that the domestic industry has begun to make a positive adjustment to import competition, as shown by the increases in domestic module production capacity, production, and market share.&nbsp; Proclamation 10101 also:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a)&nbsp; revoked the exclusion of bifacial modules from application of the safeguard measure on the basis that it had impaired and was likely&nbsp;to continue to impair the effectiveness of the safeguard action; and<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b)&nbsp; adjusted the safeguard tariff for the fourth year of the safeguard measure from 15 percent to 18 percent on the basis that the exclusion of bifacial modules from application of the safeguard tariffs had impaired the remedial effectiveness of the 4-year action proclaimed in Proclamation 9693, and to&nbsp;achieve the full remedial effect envisaged in that action.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6.&nbsp; On November 16, 2021, the United States Court of International Trade held in Solar Energy Industries Association et al. v. United States (SEIA) that the President acted outside of his statutory authority in issuing Proclamation 10101, and enjoined the Government from enforcing that proclamation.&nbsp; This injunction had the effect of reinstating the exclusion of bifacial modules from the safeguard tariffs and lowering the fourth year safeguard tariff to 15 percent.&nbsp; On January 14, 2022, the Government filed a notice of appeal of SEIA to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7.&nbsp; On December 8, 2021, in response to petitions by representatives of the domestic industry, the USITC issued its determination and report pursuant to section 204(c) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2254(c)), finding that safeguard action continues to be necessary to prevent or remedy the serious injury to the domestic industry, and that there is evidence that the domestic industry is making a positive adjustment to import competition (USITC, Crystalline Silicon Photovoltaic Cells, Whether or Not Partially or Fully Assembled Into Other Products, Investigation No. TA-201-75 (Extension)).<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8.&nbsp; Section 203(e)(1)(B) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253(e)(1)(B)) authorizes the President, after receiving an affirmative determination from the USITC pursuant to section&nbsp;204(c) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2254(c)), to extend the effective period of any action taken under section 203 of the Trade Act if the President determines that the action continues to be necessary to prevent or remedy the serious injury, and there is evidence that the domestic industry is making a positive adjustment to import competition.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9.&nbsp; After taking into account the information provided in&nbsp;the USITC&#8217;s report and the information received from the public through the process published in the <em>Federal Register&nbsp;</em>on&nbsp;September 30, 2021 (86 FR 54279), pursuant to section 203(e)(1)(B) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253(e)(1)(B)), I have determined that the safeguard action on imports of CSPV cells, whether or not partially or fully assembled into other products, continues to be necessary to prevent or remedy the serious injury to the domestic industry, and that there is evidence that the domestic industry is making a positive adjustment to import competition.&nbsp; I have further determined to extend the safeguard measure proclaimed in Proclamation 9693, as modified by Proclamation 10101 (to the extent permitted by law), as follows:<br>(a)&nbsp; continuation of the TRQ on imports of solar cells not partially or fully assembled into other products described in paragraph 1 of this proclamation for an additional period of 4&nbsp;years, with unchanging within-quota quantities of 5.0 GW for each year and annual reductions in the rates of duty applicable to goods entered in excess of those quantities of cells in the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth years, as described in Annex I to this proclamation;<br>(b)&nbsp; continuation of the increase in duties on imports of modules described in paragraph 1 of this proclamation for an additional period of 4 years, with annual reductions in the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth years, as described in Annex I to this proclamation; and<br>(c)&nbsp; exclusion of bifacial panels from the extension of duties proclaimed in this paragraph.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10.&nbsp; I have determined that an extension of this safeguard measure will provide greater economic and social benefits than costs.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 11.&nbsp; As provided in Proclamation 9693, this safeguard measure shall continue to apply to imports from all countries, except as provided in clause (4) of this proclamation and paragraph 10 of Proclamation 9693.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 12.&nbsp; Section 204(a)(2) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2254(a)(2)) requires the USITC to issue a report on its monitoring of developments with respect to the domestic industry, including the progress and specific efforts made by workers and firms in the domestic industry to make a positive adjustment to import competition, no later than the midpoint of the period of the extension.&nbsp; After I receive that report, I will evaluate whether to reduce, modify, or terminate the safeguard measure pursuant to section 204(b)(1) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2254(b)(1)).<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 13.&nbsp; As proclaimed in Proclamation 9693, the in-quota quantity in each year of the TRQ described in paragraph 9 of this proclamation shall be allocated among all countries except those countries the products of which are excluded from such TRQ pursuant to clause (4) of this proclamation or paragraph 10 of Proclamation 9693.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 14.&nbsp; In order to address certain technical errors in the HTS, the HTS is modified as set forth in Annex II to this proclamation.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 15.&nbsp; Section 604 of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2483) authorizes the President to embody in the HTS the substance of the relevant provisions of that Act, and of other acts affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction.<br><br>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in&nbsp;me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, including sections 203, 204, and 604 of the&nbsp;Trade Act, do proclaim that:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; In order to extend the measure applicable to imports of CSPV cells, not partially or fully assembled into other products, described in paragraph 1 of this proclamation, subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTS is modified as set forth in Annex I to this proclamation, subject to clauses (3) and (4) below.&nbsp; Any merchandise subject to the safeguard measure that is admitted into United States foreign trade zones on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern standard time on February 7, 2022, must be admitted as &#8220;privileged foreign status&#8221; as defined in 19 CFR 146.41, and will be subject upon entry for consumption to any tariffs or quantitative restrictions related to the classification under the applicable HTS subheading.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; Except as provided in clause (3) below, imports of CSPV products of World Trade Organization Member countries, as listed in subdivision (b) of Note 18 to subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTS (Note 18), shall continue to be excluded from the safeguard measure extended by this proclamation, and such imports shall not be counted toward the TRQ limits that trigger the over-quota rates of duties.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; If, after the extension proclaimed herein is in effect, the USTR determines that:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a)&nbsp; the share of total imports of a country listed in subdivision (b) of Note 18 exceeds 3 percent;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b)&nbsp; imports of the product from all listed countries with less than 3 percent import share collectively account for more than 9 percent of total imports of the product; or<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c)&nbsp; a country listed in subdivision (b) of Note 18 is no longer a developing country for purposes of this proclamation;<br>the USTR is authorized, upon publication of a notice in the <em>Federal Register</em>, to revise subdivision (b) of Note 18 to remove the relevant country from the list or suspend operation of that subdivision, as appropriate.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4)&nbsp; I instruct the USTR to enter into negotiations pursuant to section 203(f) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253(f)) with Canada and Mexico.&nbsp; In the event that the USTR concludes an agreement that the USTR, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of Energy, determines will ensure that imports of Canada or Mexico do not undermine the effectiveness of the action extended through clause (1) of this proclamation, the USTR is authorized, upon publication of a notice in the <em>Federal Register</em>, to revise Note 18 to suspend application of that subdivision, in whole or in part, as appropriate, with respect to imports of Canada or Mexico.&nbsp; If the USTR subsequently determines, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of Energy, that such an agreement is not effective, the USTR is authorized, pursuant to section 203(f) of the Trade Act, by publication of a notice in the <em>Federal Register</em>, to revise Note 18 to terminate any previous suspension of the action with respect to imports of Canada or Mexico.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5)&nbsp; One year after the termination of the safeguard measure established in this proclamation, the U.S. note and tariff provisions established in Annex I to this proclamation shall be deleted from the HTS.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (6)&nbsp; Any provision of previous proclamations and Executive Orders that is inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation is superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this<br>fourth day of February, in the year of our Lord two&nbsp;thousand&nbsp;twenty-two, and of the Independence of the United&nbsp;States of&nbsp;America the two&nbsp;hundred and forty-sixth.<br>&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Biden-Harris Administration will make federal procurement more economical and efficient by improving coordination and minimizing disruptions on large federal construction projects</em></p>



<p>Tomorrow, the President will sign an Executive Order to improve timeliness, lower costs and increase quality in federal construction projects. Federal construction projects span the country – from the maintenance of nuclear sites to base construction to waterways and flood projects. By requiring the use of project labor agreements (PLAs) on federal construction projects above $35 million, the Order will help alleviate the management and coordination challenges that can stymie progress on major construction projects. This helps projects get completed on time and helps the government get the best value for taxpayers’ dollars.</p>



<p>Based on FY2021 figures, this Order could affect $262 billion in federal government construction contracting and improve job quality for the <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2021-11-24/pdf/2021-25317.pdf">nearly 200,000 workers</a> on federal construction contracts. Additionally, the President’s Executive Order directs the departments of Defense and Labor, along with the Office of Management Budget, to lead a training strategy for the nearly 40,000-person strong contracting workforce on the implementation of this Order’s policy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This Executive Order is just one of many steps the Biden-Harris Administration is taking that will improve the efficiency of federal procurement. Since taking office, the President fulfilled his commitments to strengthen Buy American rules, and secured a reliable supply of experienced, quality workers for federal service contracts. As of January 30<sup>th</sup>, federal contractors in new or extended contracts must pay a $15/hour minimum wage, as the President directed in Executive Order 14026.</p>



<p>This new Executive Order, while only applicable to federal procurement, advances the Administration’s commitment to rebuild the nation’s infrastructure, on-time and at reasonable cost. The Order will only apply to provisions in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law that are direct federal procurement, which excludes construction projects financed through grant dollars to non-federal entities. The Executive Order will benefit taxpayers, contractors, and workers by:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Alleviating the coordination challenges on large, complex projects. </strong>Multi-million-dollar projects can present real management challenges to the primary contractor on the project, which has to work with multiple businesses and multiple types of skilled labor to complete a project. PLAs can help coordinate diverse contractors and sub-contractors and their employees working on a project and prevent disputes between subcontractors. Additionally, workers will have more confidence in the management of the project and a greater commitment to completing the project if they have a voice at the table. This helps projects get completed on time by minimizing work disruptions. On-time projects save the government, and taxpayers, money.<br></li><li><strong>Raising quality standards for contractors bidding on federal projects. </strong>PLAs help raise the standards of all bidders on federal contracts. Contractors who offer lower wages or do not train their workers will need to raise their standards to compete with other high-wage, high-quality companies. Businesses with well-trained workers will be more likely to bid for and win federal contracts. Well-trained, high quality workers are more productive, completing projects well and on time.<br></li><li><strong>Reducing uncertainty in the contracting process. </strong>PLAs standardize the work rules, compensation costs, and dispute settlement processes on construction projects. This standardization helps create more certainty for the government and, therefore, taxpayers, about the costs and completion rate for projects.<br></li><li><strong>Increasing training for the federal contracting workforce. </strong>The Executive Order directs the Departments of Defense and Labor, along with the Office of Management and Budget, to lead a training strategy for the contracting workforce on Project Labor Agreements and the implementation of this Order. This training will create a more uniform and accessible experience for contractors interacting with departments and agencies across the federal government.</li></ul>

<p class="has-text-align-center">One Police Plaza<br>New York, New York</p>



<p>1:32 P.M. EST<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Well, General Garland; Governor; Mr. Mayor; Representative Jeffers [sic] &#8212; Jeffries, excuse me; Representative Velázquez &#8212; they rode up on the flight with me &#8212; and other members of Congress that are here: Thank you.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I just want to thank Mayor Adams and Commissioner Sewell and the law &#8212; all the law enforcements here today for &#8212; not having me, for what you do every single day.<br><br>It’s &#8212; and let me start by saying Detective Wilbert Mora and Jason Rivera are the “who” and “what” law enforcement ought to be.&nbsp; And the &#8212; Senator Gillibrand and I have talked about that on the way up as well.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#8217;ve spoken to their families, and &#8212; and their loss for the city is also a loss for the nation.&nbsp; You know, the future is cut short by a man with a stolen Glock with 40 rounds &#8212; a magazine with 40 rounds.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s really a weapon of war.&nbsp;<br><br>One of the things I was proudest of years ago, when I was in the Senate &#8212; I was able to get these weapons and the size of magazines outlawed.&nbsp; That got changed.&nbsp; It got overruled.&nbsp; But I don&#8217;t see any rationale to why there should be such a weapon able to be purchased.&nbsp; It doesn&#8217;t violate anybody&#8217;s Second Amendment rights to deny that.&nbsp;<br><br>But anyway, their futures were cut short by a man with a stolen Glock and that 40-round magazine.&nbsp;<br><br>And I tell you, I want to thank the man back to my left &#8212; I think he&#8217;s sitting right there &#8212; for taking on.&nbsp; Stand up. (Applause.)<br><br>Now, if you’ll excuse a &#8212; as we used to say in the Senate, “a point of personal privilege,” I &#8212; when everything &#8212; when the economy died in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and I moved down to Delaware with my dad and my mom and the family, I moved to a little town called Claymont, Delaware.&nbsp; And it was a steel town just across the border from Pennsylvania, right up in that arc.&nbsp;<br><br>And I went to &#8212; I spent 12 years going to school there.&nbsp; Or actually, not 12; I started in third grade.&nbsp; At any rate, I went to a school &#8212; a little Catholic school called Holy Rosary, across from a small police department and a fire hall.&nbsp; And everybody that I grew up with either became a cop, a firefighter, or a priest.&nbsp; I wasn’t qualified for any of them, so here I am.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;<br><br>But I admire the hell out of all of you.&nbsp; I really do.&nbsp; It’s not &#8212; I&#8217;m not being solicitous.&nbsp; I mean it sincerely.<br><br>And to the many parents, spouses, brothers, sisters who have to bury a piece of their soul in the deep earth, it&#8217;s really tough stuff.&nbsp; It&#8217;s hard as hell &#8212; you all know it &#8212; to lose a colleague, to lose a son, a daughter, a husband, wife.<br><br>And I want to thank &#8212; if &#8212; there are not many here, but I want to thank all the spouses of every one of you or your significant other, because every time you pin that shield on and walk out the door, they&#8217;re worried whether they&#8217;re going to get that phone call &#8212; get that phone call.&nbsp; And too many have gotten the phone call lately.&nbsp;<br><br>And every day in this country, 316 people are shot, 106 are killed.&nbsp; And six NYPD officers have been victims of gun violence so far, just this year &#8212; the same in the town north of me, Philadelphia; and my much smaller town of Wilmington, Delaware; and Washington, D.C.&nbsp;<br><br>Sixty-four children injured by gun violence so far this year, twenty-six killed.&nbsp; It&#8217;s enough.&nbsp; Enough is enough.&nbsp;<br><br>Because we know we can do things about this but for the resistance we&#8217;re getting from some sectors of the government and the Congress and the state legislatures and the organizational structures out there.<br><br>You know, Mayor Adams, you and I agree: The answer is not to abandon our streets.&nbsp; That&#8217;s not the answer.&nbsp; The answer is to come together, the police and communities, building trust and making us all safer.&nbsp;<br><br>The answer is not to defund the police, it’s to give you the tools, the training, the funding to be partners, to be protectors.&nbsp; And the community needs you &#8212; and know the community.&nbsp; You know &#8212; (applause) &#8212; police &#8212; policing that treats everyone with respect and dignity.&nbsp;<br><br>That&#8217;s why I called on the Congress to pass a budget later this year that provides cities, like New York and others, with an additional $300 million for community policing, you know, where the police interact with the community, get to know the community, build trust in the community.&nbsp;<br><br>And I&#8217;ve noticed, in my experience &#8212; when I wrote the first crime bill, I noticed that, you know, I don&#8217;t hear many communities &#8212; no matter what their color or their background &#8212; saying, “I don&#8217;t want more protection in my community.”&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know, I haven&#8217;t found one of those yet.&nbsp;<br><br>And so, I&#8217;ve asked the Congress to provide $200 million to invest in community violence intervention programs as well &#8212; they work; they work &#8212; where community members with credibility work directly with people that are most likely to commit crimes or be victims of gun crimes.&nbsp; And they work.&nbsp;<br><br>For example, in 2017, the program I&#8217;m going to see this afternoon, which sends people to the community &#8212; in the community to interrupt violence, to mediate conflicts, to de-escalate &#8212; succeed in preventing single &#8212; a single shooting from occurring in this largest public housing development last year.&nbsp; No shooting for a full year because they engaged directly with the community.&nbsp;<br><br>You know, I know this is a priority for Senator Schumer, what you all are doing here.&nbsp; If I hear one more call from him that we need more money for housing and more money for cops &#8212; I don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;m going to send him back to you all.&nbsp; (Laughter.)</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But all kidding aside, this is a &#8212; this is a half a billion dollars of proven strategies, and we know it will reduce crime.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Congress needs to do its job to pass the budget.&nbsp; Every one of these folks here from Congress are all supportive.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, you know, it&#8217;s time to fund communities, community police, and the people who are going to protect them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Look, as I said, we&#8217;re not about defunding; we&#8217;re about funding and providing the additional services you need beyond someone with a gun strapped to their shoulder or to their hip.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We need more social workers.&nbsp; We need mental health workers.&nbsp; We need more people who when you&#8217;re called on these scenes and someone is about to jump off a roof, there’s not just someone standing there with a &#8212; with a weapon; it&#8217;s someone who also knows how to talk to people &#8212; talk them down.&nbsp; We can&#8217;t expect you to do every single, solitary thing that needs to be done to keep a community safe.&nbsp; It&#8217;s time to fund community policing to protect and serve the community.&nbsp;<br><br>And so, I&#8217;m also calling for increased funding for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, and the U.S. Marshals offices.&nbsp; I&#8217;m confident that if we fund these programs, we’ll see a reduction in violence.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the next year&#8217;s budget, I&#8217;m also going to try to double down on this investment.&nbsp; I think I got a lot of partners here in New York that are going to help.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mayor Adams, you say that gun violence is a sea fed by many rivers.&nbsp; Well, you know, I put forward a plan to dam up some of those streams.<br><br>You know, you can count on me to be a partner in that effort.&nbsp; And I have the U.S. Attorney &#8212; United States Attorney General here with me today.&nbsp; And we put together a comprehensive strategy to combat gun crime in cities like New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, and many other cities &#8212; San Francisco.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, we want to crack down on the flow of firearms used to commit violence.&nbsp; That includes taking on and shutting down rogue gun dealers at &#8212; and it’s about doing background checks, as well as outright selling of that &#8212; making sure the people who are not allowed to have a gun, don&#8217;t get the gun in the first place.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And again, for any of the press in here, the press listening: This doesn&#8217;t violate anybody&#8217;s Second Amendment right.&nbsp; There&#8217;s no violation of a Second Amendment right.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We talk like there&#8217;s no amendment that&#8217;s absolute.&nbsp; When the amendment was passed, it didn&#8217;t say anybody can own a gun and any kind of gun and any kind of weapon.&nbsp; You couldn&#8217;t buy a cannon in &#8212; when the &#8212; this &#8212; this amendment was passed.&nbsp; And so, no reason why you should be able to buy certain assault weapons.&nbsp; But that&#8217;s another issue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And look, one of the things that we focused on, the Attorney General and I &#8212; and we&#8217;re getting to the point where I think we&#8217;re going to be able to have a real impact on it &#8212; includes going after ghost guns.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ghost guns are the guns everyone in this room knows that can be purchased in parts, assembled at home, no serial number, and can&#8217;t be traced.&nbsp; And they’re as deadly as any other weapon out there.&nbsp; But the fact is: They are out there.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, you know, this spring, the Justice Department &#8212; this spring, the Justice Department will issue a final rule to regulate these so-called “ghost guns.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But there&#8217;s more we can do.&nbsp; Across the country, police departments reported sharp increases in the number of ghost guns found at crime scenes.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why, today, the department is launching an intes- &#8212; an intensified National Ghost Gun Enforcement Initiative to determine and deter criminals from using those weapons to cover their tracks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you commit a crime to the ghost gun, not only are state and local prosecutors going to come after you, but expect federal charges and federal prosecution as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We&#8217;ve also created a strike force to crack down on illegal gun trafficking across state lines.&nbsp; As the mayor said, as he pointed out, guns that are used to kill people in New York City, they aren&#8217;t made in New York City, they aren&#8217;t sold in New York City.&nbsp; They are sold in other places.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, the Attorney General directed all U.S. attorneys in the United States to prioritize combating gun trafficking across state lines and city boundaries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Justice Department is sending additional prosecutorial resources to help shut down what&#8217;s referred to, as you all know, as the “Iron Pipeline” that funnels guns from shops in states like Georgia to crime scenes in Baltimore and Philadelphia and New York and so many other places.<br><br>Governor, you worked with the mayor and the NYPD and nine other states to create an Interstate Task Force on Illegal Guns.&nbsp; That&#8217;s the kind of leadership that&#8217;s going to solve the problem.&nbsp; And I&#8217;m eager to hear more about that progress.<br><br>And, folks, the second thing I want to point out is I want to help every major city follow New York&#8217;s lead to put together partnerships like this one you put together that meet on a daily basis.<br><br>Every day, here in New York City, like this meeting today, federal, state, and local enforcement meet to share intelligence about arrests, shootings from the day before, and work to take those shooters off the streets as quickly as possible.<br><br>Just look around: This is what a partnership looks like, and this is what you put together.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s an important partnership.&nbsp; And we need more cities adopting the same model.&nbsp;<br><br>That&#8217;s why, today, the Attorney General is also directing U.S. attorneys to work with state and local law enforcement to strength &#8212; to strengthen partnerships like this one and to get repeat gun violence offenders off the street and behind bars.<br><br>You know, I want more cities and states to use some of the $350 billion we sent to them on the American Rescue Plan to fight crime, to keep our communities safe by hiring more police officers for community policing and paying police overtime, and purchasing gun-fighting technologies, like technologies that hears, locates gunshots so there can be immediate response because you know exactly where it came from.<br><br>The third thing our plan calls for: investing in critical services that reduce crime and violence; community violence intervention programs, like the one I&#8217;m going to see after this meeting; summer school; afterschool programs for teens.&nbsp;<br><br>As the saying goes and the teachers have taught me, “An idle mind is a devil’s workshop.”&nbsp; We got to have things for these kids to do, jobs for young adults, more school counselors and nurses, more mental health required in school, and mental health/substance abuse treatment as well.<br><br>Fourthly, with someone &#8212; when someone finishes their time in prison, all our experience tells us you just can&#8217;t continue to give them 25 bucks and a bus ticket.&nbsp; They’ll end up under the same bridge you arrested them in the first place from.&nbsp;<br><br>And so I don&#8217;t want &#8212; I don&#8217;t want them ending up back in prison or being there because they&#8217;ve committed another crime.&nbsp; We need to be able to train for and get a job, find stable housing, reenter society, and have a second chance at a better life.<br><br>My Department of Labor is funding programs that help formerly incarcerated individuals, including young adults, receive the education and training they need and then connect them to quality jobs.<br><br>I&#8217;ll keep doing everything in my power to make sure that communities are safer.&nbsp; But Congress needs to do its part too: pass universal background checks, ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, close loopholes, and keep out of the hands of domestic abusers &#8212; weapons, repeal the liability shield for gun manufacturers.&nbsp;<br><br>Imagine had we had a liability &#8212; they&#8217;re the only industry in America that is exempted from being able to be sued by the public.&nbsp; The only one.&nbsp; Imagine had that been the way with cigarette manufacturers.&nbsp; Where the hell would we &#8212; where the heck would we be?&nbsp; We&#8217;d be in tough shape.&nbsp;<br><br>Why gun manufacturers?&nbsp; Because of the power of their lobbying ability.&nbsp; It&#8217;s got to end.&nbsp; End.&nbsp; They’ve got to be held responsible for the things that they do that are irresponsible.&nbsp;<br><br>And, folks, you know, it&#8217;s the only industry in America, as I said, that’s exempt from being sued.&nbsp; And I think &#8212; I find it to be outrageous.<br><br>And, folks, these laws, if we&#8217;re able to pass them, are going to save lives, and more &#8212; and equally importantly, help you protect one another and protect yourself, put law enforcement in a more &#8212; a safer circumstance.<br><br>We have an opportunity to come together and fulfill the first responsibility of government and our democracy: to keep each other safe.<br><br>So, I want to thank you all.&nbsp; There&#8217;s much more to say, but I probably already said too much, because a lot of people are going to speak.&nbsp; But let&#8217;s get this done.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s get this done.<br><br>And God bless the men and women who put their lives on the line every single day to keep our communities safe.&nbsp;<br><br>Now I&#8217;m going to turn it over, with your permission, to the Attorney General &#8212; Attorney General Garland.&nbsp; General?<br><br>1:47 P.M. EST</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Aboard Air Force One<br>En Route New York, New York</p>



<p>11:36 A.M. EST<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I know this is a short flight, so I thought I would just start.&nbsp; And I know we&#8217;ve done a number of briefings, but just giving you all just a couple of key points on the President&#8217;s engagement in the operation that happened overnight last night.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The operation has been months in &#8212; was months in planning.&nbsp; The President was first briefed on this operation in depth over a month ago by the actual operational commanders.&nbsp; He was regularly updated by the national security team on the planning details of this operation, to include a briefing in the Oval Office on Monday.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last night, the President monitored key aspects of the operation in real time in the White House Situation Room.&nbsp; I think you all saw the photo that we released on that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also want to stress that the President directed the Department of Defense to take every precaution to minimize noncombatant casualties in the operation, hence how they proceeded with their &#8212; the operation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, as we know and we saw, ISIS once again revealed its barbarity in a final act of cowardice, and displaying a never-ending &#8212; ended &#8212; disregard for innocent lives.&nbsp; Hajji Abdullah detonated an explosive device shortly after U.S. forces arrived on site, killing himself, a woman, and three children.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, there will be more assessments.&nbsp; I mean, the Department of Defense will do an assessment, as they always do.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But just wanted to outline that at the top.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know we also did a briefing on the trip today to New York, but why don&#8217;t we get to your questions?</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; Two subjects.&nbsp; First, obviously, news of the day.&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Big picture: Strategically, what does this mean for U.S.?&nbsp; What does this mean for the Islamic State?&nbsp; And what does this mean for Syria?</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And did you coordinate or communicate with Russia at all, given the airspace issues in Syria?</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Let me start with the first question.&nbsp; Hajji Abdullah’s death delivers a catastrophic blow to ISIS and shows that the United States will take out terrorist threats no matter where they stand to hide in the world &#8212; try to hide in the world.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last night&#8217;s effective action took a major terrorist leader off the battlefield and makes it clear that we will hold anyone accountable who seeks to harm Americans at home or around the world.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would also note that while this planning was taking place, of course, we were also leading a coordinated effort, as you all know &#8212; more than 200 engagements with leaders around the world &#8212; to stand up for the sovereign &#8212; the territorial integrity of Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so, it shows the competence of U.S. leadership, the effectiveness of U.S. leadership, and our ability to keep the American people safe while also standing up for our values at the same time.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In terms of international coordination, it&#8217;s a good question.&nbsp; I will have to check with the State Department on the specifics of it.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was there a video component to the scene unfolding in the Situation Room?&nbsp; And who else was in there with him?</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I&#8217;m sure I can get you a complete list.&nbsp; I know some individuals were shown in the photo we released.&nbsp; Members of his national security team were there, including Jake Sullivan and Liz Sherwood-Randall.&nbsp; I think you could see John Finer in the photo.&nbsp; Obviously, the Vice President.&nbsp; We will venture to get you a full list of attendees.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, can you &#8212; on the trip today, there was some reporting by the New York Times that the White House is trying to move more to the center when it comes to crime, and there’s concern about reaching out to police organizations.&nbsp; And obviously, there’s a policing executive order that’s supposed to be in the works.&nbsp; Can you talk a bit about: Is there a conflict between civil rights groups who want more accountability for police, want less use of force unnecessarily, and what the White House is doing right now, like on this trip?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would say, first, we would direct the &#8212; reject the notion that we were moving into any political direction.&nbsp; The President has a decades-long record of fighting &#8212; of being an advocate for fighting crime and supporting local COPS programs with necessary and appropriate resources and funding.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>He has never been an advocate for defunding the police, as you know, but his record on these issues long precedes his time as President.<br><br>I would say that he is also committed and he believes that both need to come hand in hand &#8212; that pursuing police reform is a step that will help rebuild trust in communities and is something that is welcomed by many communities and police forces across the country, and he believes that goes in hand with public safety.&nbsp; Having effective, accountable community policing to help us &#8212; helps us fight crime, and it also makes us safer.&nbsp;<br><br>So, while we are here in New York, what you will hear him talk about today, as we&#8217;ve previewed a little bit, is his, you know, decades-long commitment to supporting law enforcement, to ensuring that communities have the resources they need too.&nbsp;<br><br>And you&#8217;ll hear him talk about his sweeping and comprehensive plan to adjust gun frime [sic] &#8212; gun crime and our focus on implementing that, but also, again, ensuring that communities have the funding that they need, including his proposal to double federal support for community policing with $300 million more for cities, plus another $200 [million] more for community violence intervention program.&nbsp;<br><br>But you will also hear him &#8212; and he also remains very committed to taking steps we can to put in place police reform measures that he thinks are long overdue.&nbsp; Obviously, his preference was to have had that through legislative processes, but we are looking at what can be done through executive actions.&nbsp;<br><br>I think you may have seen Susan Rice convey we’re not close on that front, but we are working on it.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, we’ve had six law enforcement officers killed by criminals this year.&nbsp; The President has not spoken out forcefully against any of these attacks.&nbsp; Even some of his supporters say the lack of forceful condemnation is demoralizing to police.&nbsp; Why hasn&#8217;t he spoken out more forcefully against these attacks?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; More forcefully against attacks against police officers?<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; He went and gave an entire speech to the &#8212; to the police forces just a few months ago.&nbsp; He &#8212; we have put out statements, and he has condemned the violence and the attacks on these police officers.&nbsp; He&#8217;s reached out to family members.&nbsp; He is somebody &#8212;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But why not (inaudible) &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Let me finish my answer, because I think that&#8217;s an inaccurate characterization.&nbsp; And you haven&#8217;t even given me names of who you&#8217;re talking about.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, Charles Wilson is &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; But the President’s &#8212;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; (inaudible) of the National Association &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; &#8212; the President&#8217;s record &#8212;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; of Black Law Enforcement Officers.&nbsp; He’s one of the people who said it&#8217;s demoralizing.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; The President&#8217;s record is very clear here.&nbsp; He has a long record of advocating for, supporting through funding, through speaking out, the role of local police, of national police and the important role they place &#8212; they play in addressing crime and keeping communities safe.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why not go to one of the officer’s funerals, if you&#8217;re going to come to New York, and show support for the law enforcement?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; The President &#8212; we have been planning this trip in coordination with the mayor&#8217;s office.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve invited a number of officials to attend the trip.&nbsp; He also is, as you know, going to the police headquarters to make clear his strong support for them.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, I know you gave a little bit of the lead-up to the raid.&nbsp; I mean, can you give more on the President&#8217;s thinking ahead of the ISIS raid?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I can, but tell me more about what you mean.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I just mean like &#8212; well, you know, a little bit more from either inside the room &#8212; I know it’s the Situation Room, but like &#8212; or what the President was thinking as this &#8212; as this raid was taking place.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I think the President, again, has been &#8212; received a number of briefings, as I noted, from his national security team over the course of the last several weeks, including one from the operational commanders just a few days ago.&nbsp; And the President was thinking: We got to go after terrorists wherever they are and get them, and protect the American people.&nbsp; He also was &#8212; made clear and reiterated this at every point in the process, to do everything we can to avoid civilian casualties.&nbsp;<br><br>So, I think you saw the photo of him in the room.&nbsp; You&#8217;re always watc- &#8212; in those moments, you&#8217;re always watching, you&#8217;re thinking about the bravery and the courage of the &#8212; of the service members who are on the ground, you know, implementing an operation.&nbsp; And that is, of course, front and center from him &#8212; for him always.&nbsp;<br><br>But, you know, he was also thinking about, you know, the role he plays as Commander-in-Chief in keeping the country safe.&nbsp; And, certainly, taking out the current head of ISIS is a big step forward in that.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you guys have a number on how many civilian casualties there were?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; There &#8212; again, that is an assessment being done by DOD.&nbsp; I would note that &#8212; as was confirmed and I just confirmed again &#8212; that, given that the intended target self-detonated and deployed a tactic used by his predecessor, that that shows, again, the brutality of ISIS &#8212; and killed his own family.<br><br>We certainly know the facts of that, but I will leave it to DOD to give any additional assessments.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And if I could, just on USICA.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are a number of House Democrats and Senate Democrats that really want to see this done by the President’s State of the Union Address.&nbsp; Are you &#8212; do you guys just want to see the House pass the Senate version of the bill, given that this &#8212; the House version is taking a lot longer with all of these amendments?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, we&#8217;re not going to make a calculation or direction of that from here.&nbsp; As you know, the process &#8212; how it works &#8212; is: Once it passes the House, it would &#8212; we would expect it would go to conference and there would be a discussion about any disagreements or any final details that are not aligned between the two pieces of legislation.<br><br>That&#8217;s a normal part of legislating.&nbsp;&nbsp;And we certainly support that.&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, the President has said he wants to sign it as quickly as possible.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few things.&nbsp;&nbsp;Were you in the room last night &#8212; the Situation Room?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp;&nbsp;No.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s start with this one &#8212; today&#8217;s event.&nbsp; The governor is there as well.&nbsp; This is an official event, but is this an endorsement of her reelection &#8212; of her election campaign?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I think this is an event and an opportunity.&nbsp; The President is a big fan of the governor, but this is not a political event.&nbsp; This is an event for the President to stand with leaders in New York as they&#8217;ve seen, you know, the tragic deaths of a number of police officers recently &#8212; people who have been serving on behalf of communities across New York &#8212; and also for the President to make clear he stands with them in their efforts to address crime in their communities.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two others from last night.&nbsp; Was he able to watch the whole thing live?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have a detail of how &#8212; of that.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And were any of &#8212; any members of the special forces team who conducted last night&#8217;s raid involved in the Baghdadi operation?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I would point you to the Department of Defense on that.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There&#8217;s a meeting today &#8212; remind me &#8212; today with Presidents Putin and Xi &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; in China.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How do we feel about that meeting and not being invited to it?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; There are diplomatic meetings that happen all the time. &nbsp;Our National Security Advisor, I believe, just recently spoke with his counterpart.&nbsp; Let me just get all the specific details on this so I can make sure it&#8217;s accurate for you.<br><br>And, you know, our view and assessment is that &#8212; oh, I should say &#8212; sorry &#8212; Secretary Blinken recently spoke to China&#8217;s Foreign Minister Wang, his counterpart, and underscored the global security and economic risk posed by further Russian aggression against Ukraine and conveyed that de-escalation and diplomacy are the responsible way forward.&nbsp;<br><br>You know, that is the message we continue to convey, including the fact that a destabilizing conflict in Europe would impact China&#8217;s interests all over the world.&nbsp; China certainly know that.&nbsp;<br><br>But we have our own means of communicating through counterparts.&nbsp; We&#8217;ll continue to do that and continue to stand up for what we feel should be global values.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And on the Supreme Court, any update on when he might begin interviewing potential nominees?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I&#8217;m not going to provide an update on the process from here.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey.&nbsp; Hey, Jen, two things on Congress.&nbsp; It seems like, on the Russia sanctions negotiations, that Congress is intent to at least include some preemptive sanctions into that bill.&nbsp; Is that a red line for you?&nbsp; Or could you ultimately support something that has preemptive &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We have done some sanctions in advance already.&nbsp; Our approach &#8212; and we are in very close touch with members of Congress about this legislation, which I don&#8217;t think has been formally even proposed yet.&nbsp; So, we are in close contact, in conversations with them.&nbsp;<br><br>Our approach from the beginning has been based on our belief that, you know, the crippling economic sanctions package that we have been discussing and has been underway in our interagency process, which we briefed Congress on, is a &#8212; has a deterrent &#8212; could have a deterrent impact as we&#8217;re already seeing in the Russian markets.&nbsp;<br><br>But we&#8217;ve never set a red line.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not setting a red line.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve done sanctions in advance, and we&#8217;re in discussion with Congress about the legislation.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, on the approps talks ongoing right now, can you detail a little bit about the White House&#8217;s engagement in them?&nbsp; And do you support larger increases to the defense budgets to get Republicans on board?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Those talks are being &#8212; we&#8217;re closely engaged with them from the White House, from our OMB team.&nbsp; But I&#8217;m not going to detail specifics of those behind-the-scenes talks at this point.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Russia &#8212;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And any &#8212; sorry, one more, Steve.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No, go right ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any fear that the ongoing talks now will further delay your budget for next year, which I think Shalanda Young said is coming past the State of the Union?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have any assessment of that.&nbsp; I know she confirmed that just a couple of days ago, so &#8212; but I don&#8217;t have a new timeline beyond that.&nbsp; That&#8217;s my understanding of where it stands at this point.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, if Russia and Belarus are having some military exercises, is this any cause for concern?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; You know, we&#8217;ve raised &#8212; our U.N. Ambassador, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, raised some concerns about this when she spoke at the United Nations, where she talked about her concern about &#8212; our concern about 5,000 troops in Belarus, the potential for 30- &#8212; up to 30,000 more.&nbsp; Clearly, this is an escalatory, not a de-escalatory action.&nbsp;<br><br>And certainly, we look at &#8212; look at, you know, these developments as we make assessments about how to support and work with our other NATO partners in the region.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With regard to the civilian casualties in Syria, are &#8212; is the administration saying that they were caused entirely by the bomb detonating or by crossfire from the one lieutenant engaging with U.S. forces?&nbsp; Like, what &#8212; give us some clarity on that.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Obviously, these events just happened overnight.&nbsp; And so, I&#8217;m going to let the Department of Defense do a final assessment, which I&#8217;m certain they will provide additional detail on once it&#8217;s finalized.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, will there be any, like, evidence or, like, release to support the idea &#8212; I mean, I know the U.S. has put out its statement that, you know, they detonated the bomb themselves.&nbsp; But will the U.S. provide any evidence?&nbsp; Because there may be people that are skeptical of the events that took place and what happened to the civilians.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Skeptical of the U.S. military&#8217;s assessment when they went and took out an ISIS terror- &#8212; the leader of ISIS?<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; That they are not providing accurate information &#8212;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; &#8212; and ISIS is providing accurate information?<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, not ISIS, but, I mean, the U.S. has not always been straightforward about what happens with civilians.&nbsp; And, I mean, that is a fact.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, as you know, there&#8217;s an extensive process that the Department of Defense undergoes.&nbsp; The President made clear from the beginning, at every point in this process, that doing everything possible to avoid civilian casualties was his priority and his preference.<br><br>I just reconfirmed, and I think our national security colleague who did a briefing this morning also reiterated, that the individual who was the target detonated himself, killing his entire family.<br><br>Given these events just happened less than 24 hours ago, we&#8217;re going to give them time to make a final assessment.&nbsp; And they&#8217;ll provide every detail they can.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Civil rights advocates have asked the President to visit Rikers Island.&nbsp; I know that&#8217;s not on this trip.&nbsp; Can you speak to why this isn&#8217;t on the trip?&nbsp; And is there a plan for the President to visit Rikers Island anytime soon?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have any trips to preview at this point in time.&nbsp; Obviously, this trip today, which is a full trip, including the President&#8217;s visit to thank law enforcement officials, to convey clearly to them that he has their back, that he is going to continue to support adequate funding and resources that they need to keep their community safe, and also to meet, of course, with leaders in the state who have shared concerns about rising crime.<br><br>But, you know, I expect he&#8217;ll be back to New York, you know, during his time as President, but I don&#8217;t have any preview of a trip to Rikers.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One thing, Jen.&nbsp; Do you have any updates on the German Chancellor visit &#8212; if you&#8217;re planning a press conference or anything to share on the details?&nbsp; Or &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I believe we are, but let me see if I can get the final details for all of you.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We’re about to land, just so you know.<br><br>11:52 A.M. EST</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">The U.S. Capitol Visitor Center<br>Washington, D.C.</p>



<p>9:06 A.M. EST</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Well, thank you.&nbsp; Thank you, thank you, thank you.&nbsp; I &#8212; I don&#8217;t know who she&#8217;s talking about &#8212; (laughter) &#8212; but thank you.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Folks, look, let me say &#8212; I hadn’t planned on &#8212; I didn’t know I was going to get that kind of introduction.&nbsp; But let me say at the outset that, you know, we&#8217;ve all gone through really difficult times &#8212; every one of you out there &#8212; one way or another.&nbsp; And I had an overwhelming advantage, and I mean it sincerely.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I had a family that was there for me every single, solitary moment.&nbsp; And so, I don’t deserve this credit for enduring that so many people I meet &#8212; think of all the people you know, whether they&#8217;re constituents or friends or relatives, who get up every morning, don’t have anybody &#8212; don’t have anybody, and they put one foot in front of the other, and they do it.&nbsp; They lost a child, they lost a mother, a father, a husband, someone close to them &#8212; just plucked away &#8212; and they get up every single day and put one foot in front of the other.&nbsp; And they&#8217;re the people who deserve our recognition and our credit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I &#8212; I think I&#8217;ve talked to Bill and Grace Nelson about this: The only thing &#8212; today is my son Beau’s birthday.&nbsp; But the only thing that Beau said to me when he was &#8212; we were told he was &#8212; he was going to die within minutes or &#8212; if an hour &#8212; that he looked at me, and he said, “Dad, promise me &#8212; promise me, Dad, you&#8217;re going to stay involved.”&nbsp; I said, “I&#8217;ll be involved.&nbsp; I’ll be &#8212; I’ll be good, Beau.”&nbsp; He said, “No, dad, promise me.&nbsp; Give me your word as a Biden that you&#8217;re going to stay engaged.”</p>



<p>Because he knew, like a lot of you &#8212; what you’ve been through &#8212; the first instinct is you just want to curl up in a ball and just leave, no longer do what you’ve done your whole life that you’ve &#8212;</p>



<p>He said, “Dad &#8212; Dad, promise me.”&nbsp; “I give my word.”</p>



<p>And that &#8212; that was the last conversation in Walter Reed Hospital &#8212; laying there in the bed.&nbsp; And &#8212; and then he looked at me and he said, “And, Dad…” &#8212; and his brother Hunter was his closest friend.&nbsp; We were all three on the bed.&nbsp; And he turned to me and he said, “Dad, I want you to know I&#8217;m not afraid.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, you know, I had so much help &#8212; so much help, starting from the time that I lost my wife and daughter in an accident.&nbsp; But look, everybody has got horrible things they’ve had to deal with.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And we&#8217;ve watched them &#8212; I sat in the Senate for 36 years.&nbsp; We watched people literally die in our midst.&nbsp; I remember that scene where Teddy walked out.&nbsp; Or &#8212; I mean, there &#8212; so, you know, I&#8217;m flattered that you think as highly of me as you stated, Kirsten, but I had &#8212; I had a lot of help.&nbsp; I had a lot of help.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I want to thank you for the intr- &#8212; the introduction.&nbsp; It’s very gracious.&nbsp; But like I said, there&#8217;s a lot more people who’ve done a lot more.</p>



<p>And to my good friend Chris Coons &#8212; two things I tell everybody about Chris Coons you got to know: One, he’s smarter than you.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; And, two, the boy can preach.&nbsp; He’s the only guy that went to law school and got a divinity degree at the same time.&nbsp; I worry about “divine” lawyers.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; But &#8212; anyway.</p>



<p>Chris, thank you.&nbsp; You’ve been a great friend.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And as &#8212; Bryan, as you were speaking, Chuck sort of leaned over; he didn’t say anything, but he just like, “Was that Delaware?”&nbsp; But it was Delaware.&nbsp; It’s why I got involved in politics in the first place.</p>



<p>I remember sitting on &#8212; going to a little Catholic grade school in Claymont, Delaware, which was a steel town that was dying.&nbsp; And the bus would go &#8212; my mother would drive me to the school parking lot &#8212; it was called Holy Rosary School &#8212; from a little &#8212; and it was called Brookview Apartments.&nbsp; Used to be Section 8 housing later.</p>



<p>And I get out of the bus &#8212; I get out of the car.&nbsp; And this is where I-95 runs parallel to these days.&nbsp; And I said, “Mom, why are all those kids” &#8212; it was then “colored.”&nbsp; “Why are all those colored kids in that bus?”&nbsp; Because in Scranton there weren&#8217;t any &#8212; there were very few Blacks.&nbsp; She said, “They’re not allowed to go to school with us here, in Delaware.” &nbsp;So, you know &#8212; and Milton wasn’t what you might call the epicenter of desegregation.</p>



<p>And so, you’ve been through a lot, but you’ve done a lot as well.&nbsp; And I thank you.</p>



<p>And, Kari &#8212; Kari Jobe, you have the voice of an angel, kid.&nbsp; I tell you what: You really do.&nbsp; And that guy sitting next to you, he’s a lucky guy.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; He’s a lucky guy.&nbsp; And besides, he’s got all his hair.&nbsp; (Laughter.) &nbsp;</p>



<p>And Vice President Harris, Majority Leader Schumer, Mitch McConnell &#8212; and, Mitch, I don’t want to hurt your reputation, but we really are friends.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; And that is not an epiphany we’re having here at the moment.&nbsp; We’ve always &#8212; you’ve always done exactly what you’ve said.&nbsp; You’re a man of word &#8212; of your word, and you’re a man of honor.&nbsp; Thank you for being my friend.</p>



<p>And, folks, members of Congress and spouses: I’m honored to join you all today.</p>



<p>You know, we’re keeping our prayers for Senator Luján, and keep him in your prayers today.&nbsp; I think, from what I understand, he’s going to be okay and be back with us in the not-too-distant future.&nbsp; But we pray for a safe recovery.</p>



<p><a>And a special thank you to the bipartisan chairs of this breakfast: Representative Lamb and Walberg, [Senators] Gillibrand and Rounds.</a></p>



<p>Mike, I know it’s been three months to this day that you lost Jean to cancer.&nbsp; So, you know &#8212; you know of which I speak.&nbsp; And it’s like losing a piece of your soul.&nbsp; And I &#8212; you know, I &#8212; I remember.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, as I said, is a day that a lot of us can remember the times when we lost &#8212; each of us.&nbsp; And just like I miss my son every single day, I &#8212; there’s &#8212; I know he’s always with me, for real.&nbsp; He’s always with me.</p>



<p>Congresswoman McBath, just like your precious son Jordan &#8212; he’s always going to be with you, for real.&nbsp; It becomes a piece of you.&nbsp; You know, how many times did you all been through this, about to make a decision and say, “What would Beau want?”&nbsp; Or “What would Jill want?”&nbsp; Or “What would…” &#8212; you know, whatever it is.&nbsp; So, it’s &#8212; you know.</p>



<p>And for everyone out there who has lost a piece of their soul, they’re always with you.&nbsp; And all through the pain, I think you &#8212; if you can find purpose, find purpose.&nbsp; Purpose of a life that makes you worthy in their eyes and what they expect of you.</p>



<p>This breakfast usually is held in a big Washington hotel with a big crowd.</p>



<p>Today, we’re here in the Visitor Center of the United States Capitol with a much smaller crowd, a more intimate setting to see each other here and listen to each other &#8212; standing in this, which is, in governmental terms, a “sacred place.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>I thank our &#8212; I think about our former colleagues and close friends we lost this year: Bob Dole; Harry Reid; Johnny Isakson, who was a hell of guy; Max Cleland; Carl Levin; Mike Enzi; John Warner; and Walter Mondale.</p>



<p>And, you know, I learned a long time ago: Never make one good eulogy.&nbsp; Because if you make one good eulogy, you got to do a lot of eulogies.&nbsp; But I’ve had the pleasure of knowing their families. &nbsp;And &#8212; and there’s a lot of good friends, both sides of the aisle, who disagreed on many, many things, who still talked and listened to one another.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think I’ve said to Mitch and some of you earlier, in the last couple of years, that, you know, one of the things I don’t know for sure but I think is missing in the Congress is we don’t spend as much time with one another as we used to.&nbsp; We used to eat lunch together.&nbsp; I mean, literally sit down &#8212; not in the Senate Dining Room of the Senate or that small dining room off to the &#8212; right across the hall from the visitors dining room, and there were those two big round tables &#8212; big &#8212; big dining room tables and a buffet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I remember when I first got here, after my wife and daughter were killed in an accident, my boys were still in the hospital &#8212; and I remember Teddy would always come and say, “Come to lunch.”&nbsp; I didn’t want any part of going to lunch.&nbsp; And one day, he just dragged me over to lunch.&nbsp; He said, “You’ll learn more there than at any place else.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I would go to lunch there, literally every day, and listen to the senior members.&nbsp; And you learn about their losses, their happiness.&nbsp; You learn about them.&nbsp; You learn about their &#8212;</p>



<p>You know, I remember one day I walked in and there was a little corner in the table &#8212; or a corner table, when the big table was filled.&nbsp; And I sat down.&nbsp; And Jimmy said, “Come over here, Joe.&nbsp; Sit down here.”&nbsp; And I wasn’t about to sit in John Stennis’s seat, because he sat at the head of the table.&nbsp; And he said, “No, come on.&nbsp; He’s gone.”&nbsp; So, I ordered my hamburger or whatever (inaudible) and took a couple of bites.&nbsp; And in walks John Stennis.&nbsp; And I immediately put a napkin on all my stuff and I said, “I’m finished Mr. Chairman.&nbsp; Come on.&nbsp; Right here.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>I later got a handwritten letter from him, about three o’clock in the afternoon: “I appreciate the honor of you recognizing my seat, but you didn’t finish your meal.&nbsp; I promise this favor will be returned.”</p>



<p>He not only returned, he actually endorsed me when I ran for President from Mississippi.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; And I think &#8212; that was an expensive hamburger for him.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>But I guess what I’m trying to say is: You know, when you know one another, when you know &#8212; and no matter how badly you disagree &#8212; and people think, Rev, that in the days as divided here, we had &#8212; we had a lot of flat-out, old segregationists still in our caucus.&nbsp; But Teddy Kennedy would argue like hell with Jim Eastland, and then he’d go down to have lunch.&nbsp; Didn’t agree with one another, but they treated each other with respect even in that day.</p>



<p>And I &#8212; I just think that, when you learn that another man or woman &#8212; and you’re flying a codel, and someone has their husband or wife with them, and you learn that they have a kid with a problem with alcoholism, or you learn that they have a daughter who is &#8212; has breast cancer.&nbsp; You learn that they have &#8212; it’s hard to dislike the person.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so, one of the things I pray for &#8212; and I mean it &#8212; is that we sort of get back to the place &#8212; and it’s so busy; I think things have changed so much &#8212; but that we get to really know each other.&nbsp; It’s hard to really dislike someone when you know what they’re going through is the same thing you’re going through.</p>



<p>You know, like President Eisenhower, the first president to attend this breakfast 70 years ago &#8212; at the time, President Eisenhower said &#8212; he said, “There&#8217;s a need we all have in these days and times for some help which comes from outside ourselves.”&nbsp; Outside ourselves.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve attended many of these prayer breakfasts over the years &#8212; with our nation at war, in struggle, in strife, peace, in times of prosperity, when everybody was getting on, but a nation in prayer.</p>



<p>Jill and I have been humbled by the prayers of so many of you, and it means everything to us.&nbsp; We pray for our nation as we face an inflection point in our history.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So much is going to change no matter who&#8217;s sitting in my job.&nbsp; The world is changing.&nbsp; The world is changing.</p>



<p>I &#8212; there’s a &#8212; the moment &#8212; but there&#8217;s also a moment of great progress, of lives saved in this pandemic, not just the ones lost &#8212; new jobs created for people, new hope for rebuilding the nation, but also a moment of pain for the lost lives and the &#8212; and the lives lost in this pandemic.&nbsp; And the cruel twist of fates that occur.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You know, at a moment of great division of our democracy is at great &#8212; grave risk.&nbsp; I pray that we follow what Jesus taught us: to serve rather than be served.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t always do it.&nbsp; I hope try.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t always do it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I pray to keep the faith.&nbsp; That very promise of America, believing that there&#8217;s nothing we can&#8217;t do, where every person is created equal in the image of God &#8212; no matter who or where we come from, who we are, or what our color, or how we choose to pray, or whether or not we choose to pray &#8212; they deserve to be treated equally throughout their lives.</p>



<p>Faith in the very idea of America that can be defined, in my view, by a single word.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve been saying this for over 30 years.&nbsp; When I get asked to define America, one word: “Possibilities.”&nbsp; “Possibilities.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the reasons why other countries sometimes think we&#8217;re arrogant is we believe anything is possible.&nbsp; Anything is possible.&nbsp; And faith in the American people will prove each and every day we&#8217;re a great nation because we&#8217;re, at our heart, a good people.&nbsp; We do bad things when we get frightened.</p>



<p>Saint Augustine wrote that, “A people was a multitude defined by a common object of their love.”&nbsp; I believe the common objects of our love that define us as Americans are opportunity, liberty, dignity, respect, honor, service, truth &#8212; things everybody recognizes both here and around the world.</p>



<p>As I stand in this citadel of democracy that was attacked one year ago, the issue is &#8212; for us is unity.&nbsp; How do we unite us again?&nbsp; Unity is elusive, but it&#8217;s really actually necessary.&nbsp; Unity doesn&#8217;t mean we have to agree on everything.&nbsp; But unity is where enough of us &#8212; enough of us believe in a core of basic things: the common good, the general welfare, a faith in the United States of America &#8212; the United States of America.</p>



<p>Nearly three weeks ago, we were reminded of that truth.&nbsp; A gunman entered a synagogue in Colleyville, Texas.&nbsp; He took four worshippers hostage, including a rabbi, for 11 hours.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But violence and vengeance didn’t pierce the goodness and grace of that scene.&nbsp; Heroic law enforcement officers were joined by local faith leaders, including an imam, a Baptist minister who offered their help.&nbsp; A nearby Catholic church opened its doors for the hostages’ families.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At sunset, a group of Muslim women &#8212; friends of the rabbi’s wife &#8212; walked in with one of the rabbi’s favorite foods.&nbsp; They hugged and they wept.</p>



<p>Because of the bravery of the hostages and the law enforcement officers, the hostages were &#8212; escaped safely, and the families were reunit- &#8212; reunited.</p>



<p>When asked later if he would change anything, the rabbi said, quote, “We will do what we always do, which is the best we can.” &nbsp;“Which is the best we can.”&nbsp; I had a long conversation with the rabbi.&nbsp; It was interesting to hear him describe the scene and how faith mattered: Whether you’re in a synagogue or a church or a mosque or a temple, whether you’re religious or not, we’re all imperfect human beings, trying our best &#8212; the best we can, because we can&#8217;t know the future.&nbsp; We can&#8217;t know what&#8217;s coming.&nbsp; But we also can&#8217;t live in fear every step of the way.</p>



<p>That’s America.&nbsp; From darkness, we found joy, hope, and light.</p>



<p>Rather than driving us apart, faith can move us together.&nbsp; Because all the great confessional faiths have the same fundamental basic beliefs: not just faith in a higher power, but faith to see each other as we should: not as enemies, but as neighbors; not as adversaries, but as fellow Americans.</p>



<p>And as leaders of this nation who work and pray together, there is an oath to God and country to uphold and a charge to keep: to stand in the breach and to protect our democracy, to work together to right wrongs. &nbsp;That’s why we all came here, to make the most of our time on Earth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For if a house divided cannot stand, surely a house united can do anything.&nbsp; And if we do that, I think we’ll have done our duty.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With history and God watching, we will have to prove that there is nothing beyond the capacity of the United States when we’re united &#8212; the United States.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You know, some of the senior senators who are here used to kid me because I was quoting Irish poets on the floor of the United States Senate. &nbsp;And there&#8217;s a poem, “The Cure at Troy,” written by an Irish poet who I got to know.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It says: History teaches us not to hope “on this side of the grave.&nbsp; But then, once in a lifetime, [that]…tidal wave of justice [rises] up, and hope and history rhyme.”<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I honestly believe we&#8217;re at one of those moments.&nbsp; There&#8217;s so much at stake.&nbsp; The division has become so palpable, not just here, but around the world.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have a chance.&nbsp; We have a chance &#8212; a chance to make hope and history rhyme, because the rest of the world is looking to us.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every time I&#8217;d walk out of my Grandpa Finnegan’s house up in Scranton &#8212; some of you heard me say this before &#8212; he’d yell, “Joey, keep the faith.”&nbsp; My grandmother would yell, “No, Joey, spread it.”&nbsp; Let&#8217;s go spread the faith.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>
