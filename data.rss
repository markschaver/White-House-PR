<p>Today the Quad Leaders – Prime Minister Scott Morrison of Australia, Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida of Japan, and President Joe Biden of the United States – convened to reaffirm their commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific, in which the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all states is respected and countries are free from military, economic, and political coercion. They reaffirmed their dedication to the Quad as a mechanism to promote regional stability and prosperity. <br> <br>The Quad leaders discussed the ongoing conflict and humanitarian crisis in Ukraine and assessed its broader implications. They agreed to stand up a new humanitarian assistance and disaster relief mechanism which will enable the Quad to meet future humanitarian challenges in the Indo-Pacific and provide a channel for communication as they each address and respond to the crisis in Ukraine.<br> <br>In their continuing pursuit of a free and open Indo-Pacific, the Quad Leaders agreed to meet in person in Tokyo in the coming months.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>On March 6, 2003, by Executive Order 13288, the President declared a national emergency and blocked the property of certain persons, pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706), to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the foreign policy of the United States constituted by the actions and policies of certain members of the Government of Zimbabwe and other persons to undermine Zimbabwe&#8217;s democratic processes or institutions. &nbsp;These actions and policies had contributed to the deliberate breakdown in the rule of law in Zimbabwe, to politically motivated violence and intimidation in that country, and to political and economic instability in the southern African region.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On November 22, 2005, the President issued Executive Order&nbsp;13391 to take additional steps with respect to the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13288 by ordering the blocking of the property of additional persons undermining democratic processes or institutions in Zimbabwe.</p>



<p>On July 25, 2008, the President issued Executive Order&nbsp;13469, which expanded the scope of the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13288 and authorized the blocking of the property of additional persons undermining democratic processes or institutions in Zimbabwe.</p>



<p>The actions and policies of certain members of the Government of Zimbabwe and other persons to undermine Zimbabwe&#8217;s democratic processes or institutions continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the foreign policy of the United&nbsp;States.&nbsp; For this reason, the national emergency declared on March 6, 2003, and the measures adopted on that date, on November 22, 2005, and on July 25, 2008, to deal with that emergency, must continue in effect beyond March 6, 2022.&nbsp; Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13288.</p>



<p>This notice shall be published in the <em>Federal Register</em> and transmitted to the Congress.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-right">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.</p>

<p>TO THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES:</p>



<p>Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, within 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President publishes in the <em>Federal Register</em> and transmits to the Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the anniversary date.&nbsp; In accordance with this provision, I have sent to the <em>Federal Register</em> for publication the enclosed notice stating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13288 of March 6, 2003, with respect to the actions and policies of certain members of the Government of Zimbabwe and other persons to undermine Zimbabwe&#8217;s democratic processes or institutions is to&nbsp;continue in effect beyond March 6, 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<p>President Emmerson Mnangagwa has not made the necessary political and economic reforms that would warrant terminating the existing targeted sanctions program.&nbsp; Throughout the last year, government security services routinely intimidated and violently repressed citizens, including members of opposition political parties, union members, and journalists.&nbsp; The absence of progress on the most fundamental reforms needed to ensure the rule of law, democratic governance, and the protection of human rights leaves Zimbabweans vulnerable to ongoing repression and presents a continuing threat to peace and security in the region.</p>



<p>The actions and policies of certain members of the Government of Zimbabwe and other persons to undermine Zimbabwe&#8217;s democratic processes or institutions continue to pose an unusual&nbsp;and extraordinary threat to the foreign policy of the&nbsp;United&nbsp;States.&nbsp; Therefore, I have determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13288, as amended, with respect to Zimbabwe and to maintain in force the sanctions to respond to this threat.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-right">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>In recent days, elected leaders in Texas have launched a cynical and dangerous campaign targeting transgender children and their parents. The Governor of Texas has directed state officials to open child abuse investigations into families simply because they have provided access to affirming care for their children. This is government overreach at its worst. Like so many anti-transgender attacks proliferating in states across the country, the Governor’s actions callously threaten to harm children and their families just to score political points. These actions are terrifying many families in Texas and beyond. And they must stop.</p>



<p>Today, the Department of Health and Human Services has <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2022/03/02/statement-hhs-secretary-xavier-becerra-reaffirming-hhs-support-and-protection-for-lgbtqi-children-and-youth.html">announced several actions</a> to keep transgender children in Texas and their families safe—putting the state of Texas on notice that their discriminatory actions put children’s lives at risk. These announcements make clear that rather than weaponizing child protective services against loving families, child welfare agencies should instead expand access to gender-affirming care for transgender children. Respected medical organizations have said that access to gender-affirming care for transgender children can benefit mental health, lower suicide rates, and improve other health outcomes. Children, their parents, and their doctors should have the freedom to make the medical decisions that are best for each young person—without politicians getting in the way.</p>



<p>In the United States of America, we respect the rights and dignity of all families. Transgender children bring fulfillment to their parents, joy to their friends, and are made in the image of God. Affirming a transgender child’s identity is one of the best things a parent, teacher, or doctor can do to help keep children from harm, and parents who love and affirm their children should be applauded and supported, not threatened, investigated, or stigmatized. As I told transgender Americans in my State of the Union Address yesterday evening, “I’ll always have your back as your President so you can be yourself and reach your God-given potential.” Jill and I are standing with the incredibly brave transgender children, their parents, and families throughout Texas and around the country, and we will continue to fight for a future where all children can thrive.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>2:29 P.M. CST<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; I got to tell you a story.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; I hadn’t planned on this.&nbsp; When Jill and I met and fell in love, she let me know her favorite day in the calendar was Valentine&#8217;s Day.&nbsp; The first Valentine&#8217;s Day that we were together when I was Vice President &#8212; the Vice President’s office faces the Eisenhower building &#8212; the big, granite building you see on the other side of the White House.&nbsp; And there’s a triple set of stairs coming down from that building, and they come right &#8212; they look right in the Vice President’s office as you come down.</p>



<p>And the press comes down that way all the time.&nbsp; And so, the night before this Thanksgiving &#8212; this Valentine&#8217;s Day &#8212; the first one &#8212; Jill got &#8212; in typical professor/teacher form, she got the maintenance guys to bring up a 16-foot ladder.</p>



<p>And on &#8212; I think there are a total of, I don&#8217;t know, 19 panes of each &#8212; in each window &#8212; big panes of glass.&nbsp; And with that erasable paint you can have, she put a heart in every single of the five windows &#8212; four windows, saying “Joe loves Jill.”&nbsp; (Laughter.)</p>



<p>And that night, my press guy got a call from CBS Morning News &#8212; would I be on CBS Morning News to talk about Valentine&#8217;s Day.&nbsp; He said, “You ought to do it.”&nbsp; So I did.&nbsp; And while we&#8217;re getting ready to &#8212; excuse me &#8212; while we&#8217;re getting ready in the office, all the lights are down &#8212; and I think I &#8212; I think I&#8217;ve told my colleagues in the House and the Senate this story.</p>



<p>While they’re &#8212; it’s dark, they&#8217;re fixing the lights, and I&#8217;m sitting knee to knee with a woman named Juju Chang, who used to be &#8212; work with &#8212; for CBS.&nbsp; And while they&#8217;re fixing the lights, she looks at me and she says, “Everybody says you and your wife have a great love affair.”&nbsp; And I said, “I think so.”&nbsp; And I said, “But everybody knows I love her more than she loves me.”&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; And she responded &#8212; my word &#8212; “That&#8217;s what everybody says.”&nbsp; (Laughter.)</p>



<p>And then she said she had done a study that &#8212; she had been on, I guess, two or three parts on the morning show over a period of weeks before.&nbsp; And I think &#8212; don&#8217;t hold me to this, I think it was &#8212; I think it was Yale and Stanford had done this study: what makes marriages last the longest and the most romantic.</p>



<p>You can always tell when the couple is not only in love but they&#8217;re &#8212; when it&#8217;s romantic, no matter how old they get.&nbsp; And &#8212; (laughs) &#8212; she said, “You know what it is?”&nbsp; I said, “No.”&nbsp; She said, “It&#8217;s when the husband loves the wife more.”</p>



<p>I want to tell you, Jilly, this was worth the trip to come out here today.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Thank you, thank you, thank you.<br><br>If the Secret Service agents weren&#8217;t sworn to secrecy, they could tell you they&#8217;ve never heard anything like that said from the podium by Jill.&nbsp; (Laughter.)</p>



<p>I love Wisconsin and Minnesota.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>Hello, Wisconsin.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>And if you can hear me across the river, hello, Minnesota.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>I’m Jill Biden’s husband, Joe.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; And, Gordon, thank you, for that introduction.&nbsp; And Governor Evers and Governor Walz and &#8212; thank you both for &#8212; for welcoming me to both your states.<br><br>And, Mr. Mayor, Jim Paine, thank you for the passport.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; And, Emily, from Duluth &#8212; the Mayor of Duluth &#8212; when we got off the plane, she had &#8212; I don’t think she had a coat on &#8212; (laughter) &#8212; she had on a &#8212; she &#8212; I mean, I tell you, you’re tough, kid.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Thank you for the passport to both your cities.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>And thanks for your three outstanding senators, and I mean that sincerely &#8212; all friends &#8212; (applause) &#8212; Tammy Baldwin, Amy Klobuchar, Tina Smith, and Congressmen Mark Pocan and Ron Kind.&nbsp; You got a hell of a delegation &#8212; all of you.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>Last night, I was with your senators and representatives, along with their colleagues in Congress, to speak about the state of the union.&nbsp; And together, we sent an unmistakable signal to Ukraine and to the world that we, the United States of America, stand with the Ukrainian people.&nbsp; We stand with them.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br><br>And Vladimir Putin’s &#8212; Vladimir Putin’s latest attack on Ukraine was premeditated and unprovoked.&nbsp; He’s rejected repeated efforts at diplomacy.&nbsp; He thought the West and NATO wouldn’t respond.&nbsp; He thought he could divide us at home.&nbsp; But he was wrong.&nbsp; We were ready.</p>



<p>We spent countless hours unifying the European Allies.&nbsp;&nbsp;We countered Russia’s lies&nbsp;<s>and</s>[with] truth &#8212; we countered them by letting them know what was being planned.&nbsp;&nbsp;And now the free world is holding him accountable.<br><br>Putin is now isolated from the world more than ever.&nbsp; And we’ll continue to aid the Ukrainian people as they defend their country and help ease their suffering in the process.<br><br>When the history of this era is written, Ukraine will have left Russia weaker and the rest of the world stronger.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>Folks &#8212; they’re amazing.&nbsp; They’re amazing people.&nbsp; You see those scenes.&nbsp; I’ve been to Ukraine.&nbsp; I’ve spoken to the Rada.&nbsp; I’ve spent much time there over the years.&nbsp; They’re amazing people.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>And we’re growing stronger here at home as well.<br><br>As I said last night, there is no greater testament to the grit and resilience of the American people than the progress you’ve all made in the middle of a pandemic.<br><br>Thanks to the American Rescue Plan, we lifted this country out of crisis, created 6.5 million jobs &#8212; more jobs than any American has ever created in a single year.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>Our economy grew &#8212; our economy grew at 5.7 percent &#8212; the strongest growth in 40 years.<br><br>And Vice President Harris and I &#8212; we ran for office with a new economic vision for America: invest in America; educate the American people; grow the workforce; and build an economy from the bottom up and the middle out, not just from the top down.<br><br>Because we know that when the middle class grows, the poor have a way up, and the wealthy do very well.&nbsp; Everyone does fine.<br><br>My Rescue Plan reflects that vision and that’s &#8212; that was just the first step.&nbsp; We also had to invest in the country itself.<br><br>America used to have the best infrastructure in the world &#8212; the best bridges, roads, airports, et cetera.&nbsp; Now our infrastructure ranks number 13 in the world according to the World Economic Forum.<br><br>We can’t compete for jobs of the 21st century if we don’t fix that.&nbsp; That’s why it was so important to pass the<br>Bipartisan Infrastructure Law &#8212; the most sweeping investment to<br>rebuild America in all of American history.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Bipartisan.<br><br>And I want to thank your senators and representatives here today for helping lead that charge.&nbsp; And that was literally what they did &#8212; lead the charge.</p>



<p>When I signed that infrastructure law 100 days ago, we already had &#8212; we already had the ground run &#8212; we hit the ground running, announcing $100 billion in new investments to create jobs for millions of Americans &#8212; modernizing our roads, our airports, our ports, our waterways.&nbsp; And we’ll do it &#8212; we’ll do it all to withstand the devastating effects of climate and to promote environmental justice in the process.<br><br>You know, we’re building a national network of 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations so Americans can own electric cars, reduce pollution, and lead the way to a clean energy future.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>We’re going to replace &#8212; that legislation is going to allow us to replace all the lead pipes in this country so every child can turn on a faucet at home or at school and drink clean water.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>And the days of having to pull your child up outside of a McDonald’s to do their homework because there’s no Internet in your home and no Internet in your region.&nbsp; And we can provide affordable high-speed Internet to every American &#8212; urban, rural, suburban, Tribal.</p>



<p>And that’s big for rural communities.&nbsp; It helps farmers engage in precision agriculture, knowing when they should sell their products and so much more.<br><br>As I announced last night, this year we’re going to start fixing 65,000 miles of highway and 1,500 bridges in disrepair.<br><br>Your governor is going to use some of the funding from this law to modernize one of the most important bridges in this region &#8212; the one you look out the window and see here.</p>



<p>Look, the Blatnik Bridge &#8212;&nbsp;you all know this bridge well.&nbsp; It’s the bridge that connects our cities &#8212; your cities and your state.&nbsp; A bridge that carries people to work and carries goods out of your port.<br><br>You know, when the Husky oil refinery exploded in Superior back in 2018, this bridge was one that many of you took to get your families to safety and you &#8212; so you know it matters.<br><br>But you may not know &#8212; as was mentioned earlier &#8212; the bridge is 61 years old and at the end of its useful life.&nbsp; The corrosion over the years has lowered the weight it can sustain and safely handle.</p>



<p>And by the way, it wasn’t long ago &#8212; you may have seen in all the news clips &#8212; I was in Pittsburgh.&nbsp; I arrived in Pittsburgh a little early.&nbsp; But thank God we arrived when we did because just three &#8212; two hours earlier, a bridge that is as high off the ground as this bridge collapsed completely &#8212; completely.&nbsp; You should have seen it.&nbsp; It was astounding to look at, for the same reasons this bridge is in trouble.</p>



<p>And guess what?&nbsp; Thank God there were only a few vehicles on the bridge.&nbsp; No one was killed.&nbsp; You should have seen it.&nbsp; It was astounding how no one died.</p>



<p>Had it occurred just three hours later, you would have had all those school buses, all those children, all the thousands of people who cross that bridge.</p>



<p>There’s so many bridges in the &#8212; this is the United States of America, for God’s sake &#8212; so many bridges in a similar condition.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>And that &#8212; it’s outside &#8212; this bridge, also, has outdated design.&nbsp; Tight curves led to higher-than-average crash rates on this bridge.<br><br>The bridge isn’t alone.&nbsp; There are 700 &#8212; excuse me, 979 bridges in Wisconsin, 661 bridges in Minnesota in poor condition, along with nearly 7,000 miles of highway between your two states that need repair.<br><br>And now, after years of talking about infrastructure, we’re finally getting it done.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Finally.</p>



<p>And by the way, instead of infrastructure week, we’re going to have an infrastructure decade.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Decade.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Look, back in January, I announced the largest investment in our bridges in American history &#8212; a total of $40 billion in funding for bridges improvements &#8212; $40 billion, including $12.5 billion to fix the most economically significant bridges in this country, like the Blatnik Bridge.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>And on top of that &#8212; on top of that, over the next five years, based on formula funding, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will provide Minnesota an estimated $5.4 billion &#8212; (applause) &#8212; and Wisconsin $5.4 billion &#8212; (applause) &#8212; for highways and bridges.<br><br>We sure don’t want you to miss any of the Vikings-Packer games.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Oh man.&nbsp; You guys talk to one another?&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Well, we don’t much in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, but that’s a different story.&nbsp; (Laughter.)</p>



<p>In addition, even more funding is available to the states through competitive programs.&nbsp; So I believe your governor &#8212; they&#8217;re going to put their heads together and secure the funding they need to finally get this done &#8212; (applause) &#8212; putting hardworking Americans on the job; rebuilding this bridge with U.S. steel &#8212; (applause); keeping commerce flowing freely; and keeping families in Superior and Duluth safer and better connected.<br><br>But this legislation is about much more than the bridge or the bridges.&nbsp; It’s about opportunity &#8212; opportunity across the region and across the country &#8212; investing in your port, your airports, and more.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>This isn’t just about bridges and highways; it goes much beyond that.&nbsp; And I’m here at the intersection of all of these things &#8212; your airport, your ports, the river, the lake, the bridges, the highways.</p>



<p>It’s also about the historic investments we’re making in the Great Lakes.&nbsp; I don’t have to tell anyone here.&nbsp; I went to school and I grew up on one of them &#8212; not grew up, but I lifeguarded on one of the Great Lakes out in Syracuse, New York.</p>



<p>The Great Lakes provide drinking water for 41 million people.&nbsp; You support &#8212; they support more than 1.3 million jobs.<br><br>And two weeks ago, I visited Lorain, Ohio, and I announced an investment &#8212; something we&#8217;ve been promising a long time &#8212; all the places that had to be repaired both in Canada and the United States.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>But I announced $1 billion from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, accelerating clean up of sites that &#8212; where polluted waters and wastewater treatment have given the Great Lakes &#8212; and put them in great risk, including the St. Louis River, which flows between your states.&nbsp;<br><br>One study found that for every dollar spending cleaning up the Great Lakes, we generate $3 through $4 in economic benefit.&nbsp;&nbsp; It’s a good investment.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s &#8212; there&#8217;s more freshwater in these lakes than any other single place in the whole world.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>But, folks, it’s not only investment we&#8217;re making in the Great Lakes.&nbsp; On the opposite end of Lake Superior from where we stand, the Soo Locks connect this lake to other Great Lakes.&nbsp; Those locks are a gateway, connecting the things that make &#8212; we make here in this country to the rest of the world.&nbsp;<br><br>Seven thousand vessels and 90 percent of America&#8217;s iron ore move through those locks every year.&nbsp; That ore makes nearly all the high-strength steel that goes into American-made cars and appliances.<br><br>In January &#8212; in January, I announced nearly $500 million to upgrade the Soo Locks, moving goods faster while reducing costs, creating a hell of a lot of jobs and maintaining them.<br><br>It’s all &#8212; we&#8217;re also doubling the investment we&#8217;re making in our ports, including the Port of Duluth-Superior, which was awarded an $8.4 million grant to make critical improvements &#8212; (applause) &#8212; along &#8212; along with a $12 million investment for the Army Corps of Engineers to reconstruct the dock wall at the vessel yard at Duluth Harbor basin.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br><br>Look, these investments will help fortify our port while strengthening the local economy.<br><br>And when we use taxpayers’ dollars to build American, we buy American.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br><br>For a long, long time &#8212; since the &#8217;30s &#8212; there&#8217;s been a law saying, &#8220;When a President of the United States spends taxpayers’ dollars on American projects &#8212; whether it’s an aircraft carrier or railings in a public building &#8212; when they buy those products, they should buy American.&#8221;&nbsp; But there&#8217;s been an exception to the law up to now.&nbsp; It says that if, in fact, the product is not immediately available in the United States, they can buy it abroad.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>The federal government spends about $600 billion a year<br>to keep this country safe and secure.&nbsp; And there’s been &#8212; that law has been on the books, as I said, for almost a century &#8212; taxpayers’ dollars.&nbsp;<br><br>But guess what?&nbsp; In my administration, the entirety of it &#8212; from beginning to end &#8212; has to be built and made in America to be used.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Not a joke.<br><br>We&#8217;re actually doing it.&nbsp; We will buy American to make sure everything from the deck of an aircraft carrier to the steel on the bridge is made in America.&nbsp;<br><br>Look around the country: American manufacturing is coming back.&nbsp;<br><br>Once again, we’re seeing the pride that comes with stamping products &#8220;Made in America.&#8221;&nbsp; Companies are choosing to build their new factories here when, just a few years a- &#8212; just a few years ago, they would&#8217;ve built abroad.<br><br>Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown, as my Senate colleagues will tell you &#8212; he had a great saying when we announced what was happening in &#8212; in Iowa &#8212; in Ohio, I should say.&nbsp; He said, &#8220;It’s time to bury the label &#8216;Rust Belt.'&#8221;&nbsp; Well, that’s what we’re doing.<br><br>As I said last night, Intel &#8212; Intel is building a $20 billion semiconductor mega site just outside of Columbus, Ohio &#8212; up to eight state-of-the-art factories in one place.&nbsp; And by the way, the people that will be working in those factories &#8212; you know what he told me that they&#8217;re going to &#8212; average pay is going to be?&nbsp; One hundred and thirty-five thousand dollars a year.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Ten thousand jobs and most of them union jobs &#8212; (applause) &#8212; making a computer chip the size of a fingertip that power the world and our everyday lives &#8212; smartphones, the Internet, technology that doesn’t even exist today.<br><br>And if Congress passes the Bipartisan Innovation Act that’s on their desks now, Intel is ready to increase their investment from $20 billion to $100 billion.&nbsp; Intel alone &#8212; alone.<br><br>Ford has invested $11 billion to build electric vehicles,<br>creating 11,000 new, good-paying jobs across the country.<br><br>GM is making the largest investment in its history: $7 billion to build electric vehicles, creating 4,000 jobs in Michigan.<br><br>The Union Pacific Railroad &#8212; when I was in Pittsburgh, I &#8212; I met the folks who run that.&nbsp; Union Pacific Railroad just announced the purchase of the largest-ever purchase of electric locomotives made in Erie, Pennsylvania.&nbsp; And in the same plant, by the way, that the guy who turned on our lights built a factory.&nbsp;<br><br>All told, we&#8217;ve created 369,000 new manufacturing jobs in America just last year.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>Don&#8217;t tell me we can&#8217;t be a manufacturing center again; we can.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; We have to keep that story going.&nbsp;<br><br>But we know that despite this historic recovery, too many families are still struggling with higher costs.&nbsp; I get it.&nbsp; Our top priority must be getting prices under control.<br><br>Look, our economy roared back faster than most predicted,<br>but the pandemic meant businesses had a hard time hiring enough help to keep their workers and the production.&nbsp; The reason why the cost of housing went up and new housing is because no one is there to make sure they had the two-by-fours to be built to &#8212; to build a home because people weren&#8217;t in the factories.<br><br>And because people are making a lot more money than before, there was a lot of cash at hand, and they did not use that cash to go out to the restaurants or go on vacation.&nbsp; They used it for hard products.&nbsp; And the pandemic disrupted global supply chains.&nbsp;<br><br>When factories close, it takes longer for goods to get from the warehouse to the stores and prices go up.&nbsp;<br><br>Look at cars.&nbsp; Last year, there weren&#8217;t enough semiconductors to make all the cars people wanted to buy.&nbsp; They had the money to buy them, but there weren&#8217;t enough &#8212; literally enough cars.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Because we invented the s- &#8212; the &#8212; the &#8212; those chips when we went to the Moon, but we didn&#8217;t make them anymore.&nbsp; They&#8217;re made in the rest of the world.&nbsp; So, prices went way up.&nbsp; One third of the reason for inflation was the cost of these &#8212; additional costs of automobiles.&nbsp; So, we have a choice.<br><br>One way to fight inflation is drive down wages and make Americans poorer.&nbsp;<br><br>I have a better way to fight inflation: Lower your cost, not your wages.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>We&#8217;re going to make more cars and semiconductors in America, more infrastructure innovation in America, more goods moving faster and cheaper in America, more jobs that you can earn a living &#8212; a good living by here in America.&nbsp; Instead of relying on foreign supply chains, let&#8217;s make it in America again.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>There&#8217;s a lot more to my plan to lower costs and lower &#8212; and lower the deficit.&nbsp; By the way, we&#8217;re going to lower the deficit by a trillion dollars this year.&nbsp; These guys talk about how they always are worried about us spend- &#8212; we’re lowering the deficit.&nbsp; No one has ever done that.&nbsp;<br><br>But look, I&#8217;ve kept you long enough.&nbsp; There&#8217;s a lot more I&#8217;m inclined to say, and I &#8212; I don&#8217;t want to get go- &#8212; I don&#8217;t want to get wound up here.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br><br>But let me close with this: Look, I am truly more optimistic about America today than I&#8217;ve ever been.&nbsp; And I really mean it.&nbsp; We&#8217;re in a path to win the economic competition of the 21st century that we face with the rest of the world.&nbsp;<br><br>I told Xi Jinping, who I&#8217;m told I&#8217;ve met with more than any other world leader, that it’s never been a good bet to bet against the American people &#8212; never.&nbsp; Given half a chance, they&#8217;ve never, ever, ever, ever let the country down.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>We&#8217;re the only nation that has always turned every crisis we&#8217;ve faced into an opportunity.&nbsp; No other nation you can name has gone through a terrible circumstance and come out at the other end worse off than they were before they &#8212; their circumstance occurred.&nbsp;<br><br>We&#8217;re stronger today than we were a year ago.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re going to be stronger a year from now than we are today.&nbsp; So, let&#8217;s keep building.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s continue to give families a fighting chance.&nbsp; And let&#8217;s meet this moment together.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Folks, one last thing I&#8217;d like to say to you: The other reason why I&#8217;m so optimistic is because of the younger generation.&nbsp; You know, we are a country that is very diverse.&nbsp; And for the longest time &#8212; and we still have some serious resistance to diversity in this country.&nbsp; But guess what?&nbsp; The younger generation doesn’t feel that &#8212; the generation that goes to this university; the gen- &#8212; the generation that&#8217;s in high school and up through age 30.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Look at them.&nbsp; Look at how they interact with one another.&nbsp; They make no distinctions based on race.&nbsp; They make no distinction based on gender.&nbsp; Think of what&#8217;s happening.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>One of the things that I&#8217;m confident about is they are together and they want the nation to be together.&nbsp; And one of the things I promised I would do &#8212; and I&#8217;ve gotten criticized for, but I&#8217;ll just flat out admit it and I&#8217;m not going to stop &#8212; my administration is going to look like America.&nbsp; (Applause.) Look like America.<br><br>For example, in my administration, we have more women than we have men.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; A little bit.&nbsp; That’s because all the women in my life are smarter than I am.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;<br><br>We also have the greatest diversity we&#8217;ve ever had.&nbsp;<br><br>Look, folks &#8212; (applause) &#8212; there&#8217;s nothing &#8212; there truly is nothing beyond our capacity.&nbsp; There really isn&#8217;t.&nbsp;<br><br>We&#8217;re the most unique nation in the history of the world in that we&#8217;re the only nation built on an idea &#8212; not geography, not built on the notion of race or religion or ethnicity; none of that fits the description of the United States &#8212; built on an idea that we hold these truths to be self-evident that all women and men are created equal, endowed by their Creator, with certain inalienable rights &#8212; life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve never lived up to it, but we&#8217;ve never walked away from it.&nbsp; And every generation has moved that dial closer and closer and closer.&nbsp; And we badly need it now in a world that is so close.&nbsp;<br><br>Look, folks, your kids are going to see more change in the next 10 years than we&#8217;ve seen in the last 50 because of the changes in technology and so much more.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve got to be ready. America has always been ahead of the curve because we do hold these truths to be self-evident.<br><br>Again, we&#8217;re not perfect &#8212; we&#8217;re not even close &#8212; but we never have walked away.&nbsp; And Vladimir Putin was counting on being able to split up the United States.&nbsp;<br><br>Look, how would you feel if you saw crowds storm and break down the doors of the British Parliament, kill five cops, injure 145 &#8212; or the German Bundestag or the Italian Parliament?&nbsp; I think you&#8217;d wonder.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Well, that&#8217;s what the rest of the world saw.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not who we are.&nbsp; And now, we&#8217;re proving, under pressure, that we are not that country.&nbsp; We&#8217;re united.&nbsp;<br><br>And folks, that&#8217;s how I was able &#8212; we were able to make sure we kept Europe united and the free world united.&nbsp; A vote in the United Nations to condemn Putin &#8212; 141 countries voted to do that in the U.N. General Assembly.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Several abstained.&nbsp; China abstained &#8212; didn&#8217;t &#8212; didn’t vote with them but abstained.&nbsp; India abstained.&nbsp; Seven countries abstained &#8212; I think it was the number.&nbsp; They&#8217;re alone.&nbsp; And they did what they did &#8212; in my view, he did what he did because he thought he could split NATO, split Europe, and split the United States.&nbsp;<br><br>We&#8217;re going to demonstrate to the whole world no one can split this country.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br><br>Thank you all so very much.&nbsp; Thank you.<br><br>2:59 P.M.

<p>Today, for the first time in 40 years, the United Nations Security Council convened an Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly under the Uniting for Peace mechanism in response to Russia’s unprovoked, unjustified, and unconscionable war on Ukraine. This extraordinary move by the United Nations demonstrates the extent of global outrage at Russia’s horrific assault on a sovereign neighbor and showcased unprecedented global unity.</p>



<p>An overwhelming majority of nations around the world condemn Putin’s war. An overwhelming majority of nations recognize that Putin is not only attacking Ukraine, he is attacking the very foundations of global peace and security—and everything the United Nations stands for. And an overwhelming majority of the world recognizes that if we do not stand up to Putin’s Russia, it will only inflict further chaos and aggression on the world. Russia stood isolated, with the support of only four brutal, authoritarian states.</p>



<p>I commend the Member States of the United Nations for holding this historic session.Today’s vote lays bare Putin’s isolation.&nbsp;It also holds Belarus accountable for its unacceptable involvement in this war.</p>



<p>The world is rejecting Russia’s lies.&nbsp;We can all see what is happening in Ukraine with our own eyes. Russia is responsible for the devastating abuses of human rights and the international humanitarian crisis that we are watching unfold in Ukraine in real time. There is no room for excuses or equivocation. Russia is to blame.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The United Nations was founded to “save succeeding generations from the scourge of war.”  As Secretary-General António Guterres said, enough is enough. Together, we must—and we will—hold Russia accountable for its actions.  We will demonstrate that freedom always triumphs over tyranny.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Superior, WI</p>



<p>On another cold winter morning—much like today—I held our family bible and watched my husband take the oath of office.  </p>



<p>In that moment, he was the man I fell in love with so many years ago—a father of two boys standing in the wreckage of unthinkable loss, who stitched a broken family back together with grit and grace.</p>



<p>He was the man who took the train home to Delaware every night, because he knew that showing up for the smallest moments can sometimes mean the most.</p>



<p>He was the Senator who learned to get up when he got knocked down and fight even harder for what he knows is right. &nbsp;He was the Vice President whose steadfast counsel helped guide our country through many storms.</p>



<p>That day, he was Joe—and then, suddenly, he became something else, too: The President of the United States.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It felt like Americans across the country were holding their breath in the aftermath of four years of chaos.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But as Joe stood there—shoulders back, eyes shining with fierce optimism—I could see his determination to bring us together, to lead us forward to a better America. And every day since, he has worked to do just that.</p>



<p>Millions of families have been able to send their children back to school and find jobs and catch up on bills.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They’ve been able to finally take a breath.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We still have a long way to go. Our world faces incredible challenges. But things are so much better.</p>



<p>You were right to put your faith in Joe Biden a year ago. Because in the face of uncertainty, he is unshakeable. Despite deep divides—at home and abroad—he knows how to bring people together…how to rally the world when tyrants reach for power.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He never loses sight of what this is all about: the people he serves.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When Joe goes to bed at night, and when he wakes up in the morning, he thinks about how to make life better for you and your family.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s just who he is. It’s who he’s always been. &nbsp;</p>



<p>He will never stop working for you—he will never stop fighting for you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thank you.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Aboard Air Force One<br>En Route Duluth, Minnesota</p>



<p>12:13 P.M. EST</p>



<p>     MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Hey, everybody.  Okay.  So, today, the President and the First Lady are traveling to Superior, Wisconsin, to discuss build &#8212; building a better America and how the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law delivers for the American people by rebuilding roads and bridges, and creating good-paying union jobs.<br><br>     As the President said last night, we’re done talking about infrastructure week; we are moving into infrastructure decade.<br><br>     Thanks to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, we will see historic investments in infrastructure that will create a visible impact in the lives of American families across the country for years to come.<br><br>     Today, the President will visit the Blantnik &#8212; Blatnik &#8212; hopefully I said that right &#8212; Bridge &#8212; excuse me, for the Wis- &#8212; folks from Wisconsin &#8212; a bridge that serves as a critical link for the community and local economy but is nearing the end of its usable life.<br><br>     The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law includes a total of $40 billion in funding to repair, rehabilitate, and replace bridges. Over the next year, states will start repair on over 1,500 bridges. <br><br>     The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law also supports a number of projects in the region, including restoring the St. Louis River and Great Lakes, investing in port infrastructure for the Port of Superior, and help improve climate resilience in the region.<br><br>     Last night &#8212; just a little bit more about last night &#8212; you heard the President speak directly to the American people about his vision to build a better America, where he laid out the progress of the &#8212; of last year in the face of deep challenges; the character, courage, and resilience of the American people; and his optimism for the future; and his resounding belief that it’s never a good bet to bet against the American people.<br><br>     He sent clear a message to the world: The U.S. and our Allies are united against Russia’s aggression, and that Putin’s war of choice has already had devastating impacts on the Russian economy.  For those here at home and abroad, democracy will prevail over autocracy.<br><br>     He also laid out the economic strategy of his administration, which is producing historic results, which his plan &#8212; with his plan to lower costs for American families while continuing an historically strong economic recovery.<br><br>     The President also talked about how he &#8212; how we have entered a new phase in our battle against COVID-19 where, because of the tools we have, we are moving safely to our normal routines.<br><br>     He also discussed his Unity Agenda for this country and reminded Congress there are lots of places the two parties do agree.  And they should &#8212; they shouldn’t let politics get in the way of getting those things done for the American public.<br><br>     With that, Darlene, what you got for me?<br><br>     Q    Yes, thank you.  The President&#8217;s announcement last night about banning Russian flights from U.S. airspace: Do you have any more details on that, in terms of when does it go into effect?  Did it go into effect last night with his announcement or some date in the future?  The number of flights we&#8217;re talking about?  Those kinds of details.<br><br>     MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Sure.  So we are issuing orders blocking Russian aircraft and airlines from entering and using all domestic U.S. airspace, effectively closing U.S. airspace to all Russian commercial air carriers and other Russian aircraft &#8212; civil aircraft.<br><br>     Just to give you a little bit of update: Russia&#8217;s national airline, Aero- &#8212; Aeroflot has &#8212; has about 14 flights to the U.S. a week, in addition to private &#8212; private planes and cargo planes as well.<br><br>     Q    And is that effective now or &#8212;<br><br>     MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Let’s see.  I do have something on that.<br><br>     So, at the moment, the Department of Transportation and its Federal Aviation Administration are issuing orders today blocking Russian aircraft and airlines from entering and using all domestic U.S. airspace.<br><br>     Q    And then on a related Russia question: Yesterday, the governor of Oklahoma and also Senator Rob Portman called on the President to do two things.  They are interested in seeing the United States sanction Russia&#8217;s oil and gas industry.  And at the same time, they also would like to see the Biden administration increase domestic oil production.  Senator Wyden also would like to see the U.S. increase domestic oil production.<br><br>     MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So here&#8217;s what I have for you on that: As we have said, we&#8217;re intentionally &#8212; we &#8212; we have intentionally scoped our sanctions measures to maximize pain on the Russian economy and minimize any spillover to the U.S. and our Allies and <s>patterns</s> [partners].<br><br>     Given high oil and gas prices, cutting &#8212; cutting off Russian oil/gas will drive prices up to Putin&#8217;s benefit.  We carved out energy-related payments to allow for orderly transition of these flows away from sanction institutions.  And we will provide other licenses as necessary.<br><br>     President Biden has been very clear with the American people that because of Putin&#8217;s reckless and dangerous sanctions, this won&#8217;t be painless, as he has said before, as I just mentioned.  But we are closely monitoring energy supplies for any disruption and continuing to coordinate with major oil-producing consumers, producers to protect American businesses and consumers, including from rising prices at the pump.<br><br>     And that&#8217;s why he announced, last night, the International Energy &#8212; Energy Agency to release 60 million &#8212; million barrels of oil around the world.  And that&#8217;s what he did last night.<br><br>     Thirty of those million will be our share.  And so this is &#8212; this is in partnership with what we&#8217;ve done.    So this is, if you think about what he did in the fall, it was like a record 50 million barrels that we &#8212; that we&#8217;ve tapped into &#8212; into the SPR.  And we were able to do that with China, Japan, India, South Korea, and the United Kingdom.  The International Energy Agency is 30 members.  So this is &#8212; you know, this is what we&#8217;re able to do. <br><br>     So the President has a plan for addressing the real impacts to people&#8217;s pocketbooks.  I can give you a little bit more on what the &#8212; what that&#8217;s going to look like, because we have some updates here.<br><br>     So we put out &#8212; as far as the SPR, we put out the notice today to begin the bidding process &#8212; usually, it takes about 13 days for buyers &#8212; like major gas companies, Exxon Mobil, Chevron &#8212; or gas-trading entities to bid and win the millions of barrel &#8212; barrels released as part of our SPR.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By April or May, the crude oil will make the way out of the pipeline, get to a refinery to be made into gas; gas prices will decline thanks to the SPR release because there is an additional supply of oil coming.&nbsp; Price will stop &#8212; go up due to &#8212; will &#8212;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sorry, it&#8217;s getting a little bumpy.&nbsp; Hold on, everybody.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; price &#8212; price will still go up due to conflict in Russia but less than it would have because of the agreement with the IEA &#8212; again, 30 members &#8212; helps countries around the world, not just USA.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And if you look at what we did with the SPR back in the fall, it brought down &#8212; they brought down prices by 10 &#8212; more than 10 cents a gallon over the holiday season.&nbsp; So we&#8217;re optimistic.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So does &#8212; Karine, just to follow up on sanctions.&nbsp; Jen said this morning in some of her television interviews that sanctions against Russian oil and gas was on the table.&nbsp; And the President, I believe, echoed the same thing when he spoke to reporters before coming to JBA.&nbsp; But it sounds, from what you just said, like that is very unlikely.&nbsp; Is there &#8212; can you just explain that discrepancy?<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; And you must have been very early if you saw Jen this morning.&nbsp; You must have been up very early if you saw this morning, with Darlene.&nbsp; (Laughs.)<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; So, look, we don&#8217;t have a strategic interest in reducing the global supply of energy.&nbsp; So you&#8217;ve heard Jen talk about that &#8212; the effect of what would happen with the global supply here.&nbsp; So that would raise prices at the gas pump for Americans and pad Putin’s profits, right?&nbsp; So that&#8217;s something that we&#8217;re very aware of.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We’ve seen some American companies decide to cut ties with Russia, and we welcome those announcements.&nbsp; But, you know, we and our Allies and partners have a strong collective interest to degrade Russia status as a leading energy supplier over time.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That&#8217;s why we&#8217;ve been talking about, you know, diversification, you know, and that&#8217;s why we shut down Nord Stream 2.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re helping to accelerate Europe&#8217;s diver- &#8212; diversification from Russian gas.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s why we&#8217;re denying critical technology inputs that Russia needs to sustain its production capacity in oil and gas.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So that&#8217;s kind of our strategic focus at the moment.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There has to be at least some acknowledgement of the irony of the United States and Western countries sanctioning Russia but continuing to buy its fuel.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Look, I mean, here&#8217;s the thing: Again, there&#8217;s the global supply of energy that we really have to think about.&nbsp; We don&#8217;t want to pad Putin’s &#8212; Putin’s profits.&nbsp; And we want to make sure that we don&#8217;t raise prices on the American public.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So that is our focus here.&nbsp; And so we&#8217;re doing everything that we can.&nbsp; I think that&#8217;s why we talked about diversification &#8212; make sure we&#8217;re not just relying on that source, on Russia&#8217;s oil.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So we&#8217;re going to continue to work on that.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve been assisting our European partners.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s going to be our focus right now.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One other sanctions question.&nbsp; Can you confirm that the United States is preparing additional sanctions against Russian oligarchs and others in Russia?<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; So I don&#8217;t have any anything to preview at this time.&nbsp; As you know, we&#8217;re going after Russian oligarchs and their families supporting Putin&#8217;s war of choice.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, you know, look, Russia has become a global economic and financial pariah.&nbsp; Over 30 countries, representing well over half the world&#8217;s economy, have announced sanctions and export controls on Russia.&nbsp; Putin&#8217;s government is getting kicked off the international financial system.&nbsp; We are preventing Putin from accessing his war chest to soften the blow of our sanctions and support his invasion of Ukraine.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This week, alongside our Allies and partners, we announced unprecedented actions to prevent President Putin from accessing his war chest.&nbsp; We prohibited transactions with Central Bank of Russia, the single most important financial institution in Russia.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And you know, again, we&#8217;ve done this with our partners and Allies.&nbsp; And so that&#8217;s &#8212; that&#8217;s going to be what we&#8217;re going to continue to do: work &#8212; work in lockstep with European Allies.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are more in the works?&nbsp; That&#8217;s my question.&nbsp; Are more &#8212;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have anything to predict at this time.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karine, can we ask you just to move in a little bit, maybe?&nbsp; Just to get &#8212; sorry.&nbsp; Getting lost in the doorway.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; The bumpiness &#8212;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know.&nbsp; I know.&nbsp; It’s a little hard to hear you.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; I know, and I have a mask.&nbsp; I’m so sorry, guys.&nbsp; I will do my best.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last night, during the speech, we didn’t hear the President talk explicitly about Build Back Better.&nbsp; And is that the message he&#8217;s sending &#8212; that it&#8217;s officially dead right now on Capitol Hill?<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Oh, absolutely not.&nbsp; You know, he &#8212; what the President did last night is he highlighted the major part of his plans &#8212; right? &#8212; to fight inflation &#8212; in addition to continuing work to make more in America, bring more jobs back from overseas, and strengthen our supply chains &#8212; is by lowering costs and lowering the deficit.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is what he&#8217;s been talking about the past several months, about these very popular pieces of components.&nbsp; And so he will cut the cost of prescription drugs, energy, childcare, while making the tax system more fair.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He had the young &#8212; young kid, Joshua, that he met when we went to Ohio, who&#8217;s 13 years old, and they talked about lowering costs of prescription drugs.&nbsp; He has Type 1 diabetes, so does his dad.&nbsp; The cost of insulin is &#8212; has skyrocketed.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It costs companies $10 &#8212; insulin &#8212; insulin &#8212; to make.&nbsp; But, you know, what the companies do is they &#8212; they double &#8212; they raise that 30 &#8212; almost 30 times more.&nbsp; And so, what we&#8217;re trying to talk about is lowering those costs.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so, you know, by contrast, Republicans are against lowering costs for families because they want to protect tax cuts for the very wealthy and corporations.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That&#8217;s how we build on the manufacturing resurgence we’ve &#8212; we&#8217;ve overseen and historic job creation we&#8217;ve achieved last year, which the President leaned on when talking about the American Rescue Plan meeting the moment and that &#8212; what that was able to do.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So we&#8217;re having constructive conversations with a range of members.&nbsp; But I&#8217;ll keep those conversation private, as we&#8217;ve been trying to do these last couple of weeks, couple of months now.&nbsp; And I&#8217;m not going to go comment into specific lawmakers &#8212;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But as to the parts of that last night, as you just went through, and you&#8217;re having conversations with lawmakers.&nbsp; But Senator Manchin said last night that he has not been &#8212; the White House hasn&#8217;t reached out to him for any formal conversations about the parts of Build Back Better that the President would like to see passed.&nbsp; Why not have those conversations with Senator Manchin?&nbsp; And when would they happen?<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; I mean, you&#8217;ve heard Jen say this, you&#8217;ve heard me say this: We&#8217;re just not going to negotiate in public.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are having conversation with members who are very much enthused and excited about what the President&#8217;s plan is and lowering costs, as I just laid out.&nbsp; And so that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re going to &#8212; going to do.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean, the President used the State of the Union as an opportunity to talk about his plan, to talk about lowering costs.&nbsp; And so, clearly, that is something that&#8217;s very important to him.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He also talked about &#8212; and when you think about those items I just laid out &#8212; prescription drugs, the things that &#8212; you know, that are important at the kitchen table &#8212; those are popular.&nbsp; Right?&nbsp; Those are really important.&nbsp; That&#8217;s part of, like, his Unity Agenda as well that he laid out yesterday as well.&nbsp; You know, like, we can work in a bipartisan way for the American people and deliver.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the President still making calls directly to members about the items in Build Back Better or the package formerly called Build Back Better?&nbsp; Or is that White House aides or other senators that are doing that outreach?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; So, Nancy, I don&#8217;t have any calls to preview about the President’s di- &#8212; directly speaking to members.&nbsp; You saw him speaking to members on the floor yesterday.&nbsp; He does have conversation pretty regularly.&nbsp; Former senator &#8212; he has a lot &#8212; he knows a lot of those folks &#8212; former Vice President, clearly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so &#8212; but I don&#8217;t have anything to preview.&nbsp; But I can assure you that White House &#8212; my colleagues at the White House have been in regular contact and in regular touch with folks on the Hill.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the White House&#8217;s &#8212; what&#8217;s the status on the Iran deal?&nbsp; My colleagues overseas are hearing that a decision is coming one way or the other in the coming days, and I just wonder what you could tell us about where that stands.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; So, you know, we are in the final stages of complex negotiations.&nbsp; As we&#8217;ve been saying, at this final stage, all participants are working to clarify their position on the most difficult issues.&nbsp; You know, I&#8217;m not going to go into any specific on the positions of Iran or the United States.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You know, the administration continues to consult with the P5+1, as well as with Israel and our regional partners, on the best way to move forward.&nbsp; But I would refer you to the State Department.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And just one more question on Russia.&nbsp; In terms of Putin, what other steps is the White House or administration considering on how they would target his wealth personally?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have anything more to add.&nbsp; I know the President was asked this when he was headed towards Air Force One, going on Marine One.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have anything more specific or thing &#8212; anything to predict for you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Look, you know, we have said this over and over again, which is: This is a &#8212; we have never seen such a unified West.&nbsp; We are very unified with our European leaders and part- &#8212; European partners and Allies.&nbsp; And NATO is &#8212; our NATO Alliance is also more unified than we&#8217;ve ever seen it before in history.</p>



<p>And so, you know, we are going to continue to work in lockstep and as we &#8212; as we move forward in trying to &#8212; you know, in trying to deal with this Russia aggression that we&#8217;re seeing.&nbsp; I mean, we &#8212; you know, we have to &#8212; I&#8217;m going to keep saying this: Russia is &#8212; you know, aggression with Ukraine &#8212; is attacking their territorial integrity, their sovereignty, their democracy.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s one thing that the President talked about yesterday: what our values are and fighting for democracy here and abroad.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karine, does the White House have a position on Americans who might, on their own, travel to Ukraine to answer President Zelenskyy’s call to join the fight?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; So &#8212; so Ukrainians have shown their courage, and they are calling on every &#8212; you know, they&#8217;re calling on every resource and lever they have to defend themselves.&nbsp; You know, we applaud their bravery.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, our travel advisory remains.&nbsp; U.S. citizens should not travel to Ukraine.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so that would specifically include &#8212; is that advice to Americans to not go and fight in another nation?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Again, the State Department has &#8212; issues travel advisories and warnings to help Americans make the most informed decisions about their safety.&nbsp; So that&#8217;s what I would refer you to.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have you got a reaction to Sergey Lavrov’s latest nuclear saber-rattling?&nbsp; He said that World War Three would be “nuclear and destructive.”</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; So, again, you know, this is &#8212; this is a war of choice by President Putin.&nbsp; This is his decision that he has made.&nbsp; We are going to continue to work with our European Allies, our European partners, you know, and do &#8212; do that in lockstep.&nbsp; But this is &#8212; this is President Putin&#8217;s war that he has started.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karine, the President did not mention January 6th last night.&nbsp; Was that a conscious decision to exclude that?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; So, the President has talked about January 6th many times.&nbsp; And he has spoken about it &#8212; about the horrific events of January 6th, as well as the specific steps we must take to ensure something like that can never happen again, including move &#8212; moving &#8212; movingly in the Capitol itself to commemorate one year since the attack.&nbsp; That&#8217;s ju- &#8212; the anniversary that just passed &#8212; this past January 6th.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And the President spoke last night about the need to uphold Constitution, protect democracy both here and around the world, as I just stated.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Inaudible.)&nbsp; There&#8217;s an effort in North Carolina to throw Madison Cawthorn off the ballot for being an insurrectionist.&nbsp; Has the President given that approach any thought?&nbsp; Does he endorse that?&nbsp; What does he think about people who encouraged that to be able to run again?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; So, I leave that the &#8212; the decision &#8212; or refer you to the state board of elections.&nbsp; That&#8217;s for them to decide.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karine, we haven’t seen &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karine, a couple on COVID.&nbsp; Last night, the President talked about entering a new phase or new moment in the pandemic.&nbsp; A lot of the lawmakers and people who were at the State of the Union obviously didn&#8217;t wear a mask because the guidance has changed.&nbsp; Does the President now think that it&#8217;s safe for children in school to go mask-free indoors, in school also?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; So, look, you know, today the Biden administration released a National COVID Preparedness Plan, as you all know.&nbsp; This is a plan to keep America moving forward safely and keep getting us back to our normal routines.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a plan that focuses on three key goals, which is protect against COVID-19, prepare for new variants, prevent economic and educational shutdowns.&nbsp;</p>



<p>First, on protection: Unlike at the start of the pandemic, we know &#8212; we now &#8212; pardon me &#8212; have multiple tools to protect ourselves.&nbsp; Right?&nbsp; There&#8217;s vaccines, treatments, test, masks.</p>



<p>Second, we&#8217;re preparing for new variants.&nbsp; That includes early warning signs and stockpiling resources.</p>



<p>Third, preventing economic and educational shutdowns.&nbsp; We will continue to be an arsenal of vaccines for the world.&nbsp; I think we&#8217;ve already donated just under 500 million vaccines.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Throughout this plan, we ensure we are protecting the most vulnerable, including the immun- &#8212; immunocompromised and those with disabilities.&nbsp; The immunocompromise have &#8212; -compromised have access to a fourth booster and priority access to new treatments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have free high-quality masks and more free tests than ever before.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We&#8217;re launching a comprehensive response to prevent, treat, and better under &#8212; understand Long COVID and to address mental health.</p>



<p>Executing this plan will require additional congressional funding, which you heard the President talk about last night &#8212; that supplemental funding &#8212; soon.&nbsp; And so, the administration will send Congress a request for additional funding, given that virtually all Americans have used these tools and may want to, again, expect Congress &#8212; we expect Congress to pass it quickly.</p>



<p>Jeff Zients, Secretary Becerra, Dr. Walensky, and Dr. Fauci &#8212; they all briefed on &#8212; to your colleagues earlier today, about an hour ago.&nbsp; And so, that&#8217;s kind of where we are. &nbsp;But to your question, Darlene &#8212; I just wanted to kind of lay that out.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; You know, to your question: As we&#8217;ve always said, those decisions are left to the school &#8212; the school districts and to the schools to make.&nbsp; You know, we&#8217;ve always said: Follow &#8212; you know, follow the experts, listen to the experts.&nbsp; And we try to follow the CDC guidance.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then one more.&nbsp; Again, last night, you had a situation where people are free to go mask free, and a lot of them did that last night, but then you saw people sitting in a socially distant fashion.&nbsp; So was there kind of a mixed message there where, on the one hand, the President says to people, “You know, we&#8217;re in a new phase.&nbsp; Go back to work.&nbsp; Flood downtown again,” but you have people sitting socially distant (inaudible)?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; To that &#8212; to that in particular, that was a Cap- &#8212; that&#8217;s the Capitol.&nbsp; I refer you to them.&nbsp; That was &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I fully understand it was a decision by the Capitol.&nbsp; But just the image overall and what that says to people as we&#8217;re telling them, “It&#8217;s okay to go mask-free again.”</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Well, what I&#8217;ll say to that &#8212; look, we are in a different place than we are &#8212; than we were a year ago, and that&#8217;s just the fact.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When the President walked into the administration, he was dealing with multiple crises.&nbsp; The economy and COVID were the two main ones that were front and center.&nbsp; And in that time &#8212; in that year&#8217;s time, the President has been able to &#8212; along with his team has been able to fully vaccinate more than 210 million people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so, that is a success that we can all be proud of.&nbsp; And like &#8212; as I just laid out, we know &#8212; we now have the tools that help us figure out how to move forward and get to a place where things are more normal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, this is just, you know, a next part of the process.&nbsp; And so, you know, again, we&#8217;re going to follow the CDC guidance &#8212; guidelines.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (The plane experiences turbulence.)</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Ah!&nbsp; (Laughs.)&nbsp; We almost lost Jeff Mason. &nbsp;My goodness.&nbsp; He has his cool Reuters jacket on, too.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karine, for the President personally last night &#8212; he hasn&#8217;t had an event like that where you had that many people in one space not wearing masks, and he seemed to be feeding off of that a bit.&nbsp; Can you talk about how he felt afterwards about being in an environment that we haven&#8217;t seen him in in maybe two years?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; As we all know, the President loves to communicate directly with people.&nbsp; And, you know, as we&#8217;ve been saying for the past week or so, the State of the Union was an opportunity to talk to millions of Americans.&nbsp; It&#8217;s once-in-a year opportunity to do that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so, you know &#8212; and this is a President who was a senator for almost four decades, who was a vice president for eight years.&nbsp; He&#8217;s been in that room, and he knows what it means to have that bully pulpit, if you will, to have that &#8212; to have that microphone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so, his goal yesterday was to talk about the &#8212; this past year &#8212; yes, the challenges, but how we&#8217;ve been able to be resilient and how the economy has thrived, where we are with COVID, but also the challenges that lie ahead; our support, clearly, for Ukraine with Russia&#8217;s aggression into the country &#8212; attacking their sovereignty &#8212; but also how we’re going to speak to those kitchen table issues that Americans deal with every day &#8212; those high costs.&nbsp; And also, he talked about his Unity Agenda.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, there was a lot that he covered.&nbsp; But, look, like I said, that &#8212; yesterday was an opportunity, which he understood very well, that &#8212; you know, to reach out to &#8212; directly to the American public.&nbsp; And he was happy to see some of his former colleagues and have that direct conversation.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the President &#8212; will he resume large, indoor maskless gatherings now?&nbsp; Is that what we can expect moving forward?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; You know, I don&#8217;t &#8212; as we all know, the CDC guidance is &#8212; it all depends on the area that you&#8217;re in. Like we are about to land in Wisconsin.&nbsp; We&#8217;re going to Superior, Wisconsin, as you all know, and we have to wear a mask because it is a red zone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, it is really going to, you know, depend on where we are and what we &#8212; the CDC guidance that we need to follow for that particular area.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does the President have a reaction to the interruption last night by the &#8212; I think it was two Republican congresswomen right around the time when he was talking about his son?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; So, you know, we grieve alongside these Gold Star families.&nbsp; We do not pretend to understand the depths of their grief, but we respect their concerns and their unique perspectives about the loss of their loved ones.&nbsp; So, they were part of the bravest, most capable, and the most selfless military on the face of the Earth.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; All right.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I actually wasn&#8217;t &#8212; I wasn&#8217;t actually asking about Gold Star families.&nbsp; I was asking about the &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; One of the members actually &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was that Boebert?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; She was &#8212; yeah, that’s what she was talking about.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I see.&nbsp; I thought she said, “Build the wall.”</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was someone else that shouted “Build the wall,” I think.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; It might’ve been someone else.&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have one final question for you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there &#8212; are you aware of any reaction or comment from the President to Major League Baseball&#8217;s decision to cancel Opening Day?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; I do have something on that.&nbsp; So collective bargaining is a private dispute-resolution process in which the parties to the negotiation work out their differences and agree to the terms and conditions of employment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Major League Baseball negotiations are a matter for the players, the league, and the owners.&nbsp; Baseball fans may have some opinions as well.&nbsp; We leave that to them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The best role for government is to encourage the parties to comment &#8212; to commit themselves fully to collective bargaining that reaches an agreement.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s how we feel here.</p>



<p>We encourage Major League Baseball and the Major League Baseball Players Association to stay at the bargaining table and reach an agreement as soon as they can so we can kick off the season and get back to enjoying baseball games.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thanks, everybody.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Karine.</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Thank you.</p>

<p>10:40 A.M. EST</p>



<p>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Good morning.&nbsp; And thanks for joining us today as we release President Biden’s National COVID-19 Preparedness Plan.<br><br>Today, I’m joined by Secretary Becerra, Dr. Walensky, and Dr. Fauci.&nbsp; We’ll each deliver some remarks, and then open it up for questions.<br><br>As President Biden said in last night’s State of the Union address, we’ve reached a new moment in the fight against COVID-19.<br><br>Because of the significant progress we’ve made as a country, the determination and resilience of the American people, and the work we’ve done to make tools to protect ourselves widely available, we are moving forward safely, getting back to our more normal routines.&nbsp; And under the latest CDC recommendations, most Americans in most of the country can now be mask free.<br><br>Last night, the President laid out four key goals for the path ahead:<br><br>First, protect against and treat COVID.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Second, prepare for any new variants.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Third, prevent economic and school shutdowns.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fourth, vaccinate the world and save lives.<br><br>The President’s National COVID-19 Preparedness Plan that we’re releasing today will help move us forward safely, sustaining and building on the progress we’ve made over the past 13 months.<br><br>The President’s National COVID-19 Preparedness Plan is robust and comprehensive.<br><br>The President’s plan is the product of many weeks of work with experts inside and outside of government &#8212; local public health leaders, governors, and partners across our federal agencies.&nbsp;<br><br>We thank them for sharing their ideas and expertise.&nbsp; This plan benefits greatly from their valuable input.<br><br>Importantly, executing the President’s plan requires additional congressional support and funding.<br><br>Today, we’ll provide an overview of this plan.<br><br>The first goal: protect against and treat COVID.<br><br>Two years ago, we had limited tools to protect ourselves: masks, isolation, and social distancing.&nbsp; But all of that’s changed.<br><br>Today, we have the tools we need to protect each other and treat COVID-19.&nbsp; They’re widely available for the American people.&nbsp; And with Congress’s help, the President’s plan will make sure that’s always the case.<br><br>We know that vaccines and boosters provide strong protection against severe illness and hospitalization.<br><br>Because of the unprecedented vaccination program we’ve established, 216 million Americans are now fully vaccinated.&nbsp; And two out of three eligible adults now have booster shots, which provide the strongest protection.<br><br>In fact, if you’re vaccinated and boosted, you have an extremely high level of protection against COVID, and it’s extremely unlikely you’ll end up in the hospital if you do get the virus.&nbsp;<br><br>The plan lays out how we’re going to keep working with governors, state and local health officials, and community partners to get even more shots in arms.<br><br>Importantly, we know parents of children under the age of five are eager to provide their kids the protection of a vaccine.<br><br>The President’s plan ensures that as soon as a vaccine is authorized, we’ll be ready with plenty of vaccines and prepared to help parents vaccinate their youngest kids at thousands of trusted and convenient locations across the country.<br><br>In addition to vaccines and boosters, we have filled our nation’s medicine cabinet with effective treatments and therapeutics: monoclonal antibodies, antiviral pills, and preventive therapies for our most vulnerable.&nbsp;<br><br>These treatments work to prevent the worst outcomes of COVID-19.&nbsp; And we have more treatments available for the American people than ever before &#8212; millions of treatments each month.<br><br>Pfizer’s pill is a gamechanger &#8212; 90 percent effective at keeping people out of the hospital.<br><br>We collaborated with Pfizer to accelerate development of the pill.&nbsp; And we’ve ordered 20 million courses.<br><br>As the President announced last night, Pfizer worked overtime to further accelerate delivery.&nbsp; This month alone &#8212; the month of March &#8212; we’ll have 1 million of these treatment courses available.&nbsp; And in April, that number will more than double.<br><br>To ensure these lifesaving treatments are easily accessible, the President’s Plan launches a new &#8220;Test to Treat&#8221; initiative to provide individuals access to testing and treatment for free, all in one stop.&nbsp;<br><br>Hundreds of one-stop sites will open across the country this month, located at local pharmacy clinics, community health centers, long-term care facilities, and veterans’ health centers.<br><br>The President’s plan, with support from Congress, ensures other important tools, like tests and high-quality masks are widely available, accessible, and free.<br><br>As the President announced last night, if you’ve already gotten your free tests from COVIDTests.gov &#8212; COVIDTests.gov &#8212; starting next week, you’ll be able to place a second order for tests delivered straight to your home.&nbsp;<br><br>And we continue to make hundreds of millions of high-quality N-95 masks available to Americans for free at local pharmacies, grocery stores, and community health centers across the country.&nbsp;<br><br>Vaccines, treatments, tests, masks &#8212; these tools are how we continue to protect people.<br><br>They enable us to move forward safely and get back to our more normal routines &#8212; going out to eat at a restaurant; taking that trip that’s been long delayed; arranging a playdate for your kids; attending a sports game, a movie, or a concert again.<br><br>To make sure people have the tools they need to protect themselves, we’ll launch a website later this month that will be a go-to place where you can find vaccines and masks at easy and convenient locations, and where you can find the latest information on COVID-19 in your community.<br><br>Now, let me turn it over to Secretary Becerra to cover how the President’s plan will allow us to keep distributing these tools and ensures we continue to advance equity.<br><br>Secretary?<br><br>SECRETARY BECERRA:&nbsp; Thanks, Jeff.&nbsp; And good morning to everyone.&nbsp;<br><br>Under President Biden’s leadership and in partnership with the White House, we have worked hard at HHS to fight this virus.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve authorized, procured, and distributed our national supply of tests, vaccines, and treatments to every corner of the country.&nbsp; We’ve conducted groundbreaking and lifesaving research to improve our understanding of the disease and how it impacts us.&nbsp; And now we move into this next phase to execute President Biden’s National COVID Preparedness Plan.<br><br>Our mission remains to protect the health and wellbeing of every American.&nbsp; Dr. Fauci and Dr. Walensky will add further specifics, but I want to focus on how we’re going to reach every American who needs our support on COVID.<br><br>To ensure we can continue to accelerate and synchronize the research, development, production, and delivery of COVID vaccines and treatments to keep Americans safe, the President’s National COVID-19 Preparedness Plan makes our logistics and operational hub at HHS permanent.<br><br>We call this permanent hub the HHS Coordination Operations and Response Element &#8212; or H-CORE.&nbsp; Under the leadership of Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response Dawn O’Connell, she and her team at H-CORE build on the successful partnership HHS has had with our dedicated colleagues at DOD, as well as our state and local partners.<br><br>Through it, we have delivered more than 690 million doses of vaccines and 4 million treatments to families nationwide.<br><br>To date, we have distributed more than 270 million free N95 masks to local pharmacies and community health centers and helped get free COVID tests to 70 million households.<br><br>No matter what the future holds, H-CORE must be ready, and Americans deserve to know that we have the infrastructure in place to get critical services and supplies where they are needed.<br><br>Another key goal of the President’s plan moving forward is to address the long-term impacts of COVID, including Long COVID and mental health.<br><br>As the President said last night, his plan directs the federal government to accelerate its efforts to detect, prevent, and treat Long COVID, building on our ongoing work, already, at NIH.&nbsp;<br><br>We’ll further expand our research and ramp up our data-sharing across the federal government, in collaboration with academic, industry, and state and local partners.&nbsp;<br><br>And, if we get the funding from Congress, we will launch new Centers of Excellence in communities across the country to provide high-quality care to individuals experiencing Long COVID and better understand the symptoms they’re facing.&nbsp;<br><br>This is all part of our commitment to be there for Americans who have long-term physical and mental health needs caused by COVID.&nbsp; They know that numbers and statistics alone don’t capture the true toll of COVID-19.&nbsp; It&#8217;s lost job and piling bills.&nbsp; It’s the empty chair at the dinner table or the open seat in the bleachers, the quiet homes, and the crowded hospitals.<br><br>That’s why this administration will coordinate a whole-of-government effort to support children and families who have experienced the loss of a loved one due to COVID.&nbsp;<br><br>This includes leveraging every program at our disposal to address fundamental needs, like financial resources to cover funeral costs to trauma- and grief-informed services.&nbsp;<br><br>We will also launch new support for people dealing with mental health-related challenges, including an expanded program to prevent job burnout and support the mental wellbeing of our nation’s healthcare workforce.&nbsp; We want every frontline, essential healthcare worker to know: We’re with you, and we’ve got your back.<br><br>This week, we’ll launch a nationwide tour to strengthen mental and behavioral health services.&nbsp; We want to engage communities to hear how we can best support Americans who’ve been hit hard.&nbsp; I head to New Hampshire&nbsp;this Friday&nbsp;to kick things off.<br><br>Whether we are working to strengthen mental health, behavioral health; whether we’re authorizing therapeutics or distributing vaccines &#8212; at HHS, we bring our unique capabilities and expertise to the mission.&nbsp;<br><br>As it has from the beginning, fairness for everyone &#8212; equity &#8212; will remain at the center of our work.<br><br>We’ve already seen the power of this intentional approach.&nbsp;<br><br>We have closed disparities in vaccination rates for Black, Latino, and Asian American adults.&nbsp; This historic progress didn’t happen overnight or by accident.&nbsp; It’s the product of dedicated focus and hard work.&nbsp;<br><br>We’ve surged resources, including tests and treatment, to our hardest-hit and highest-risk communities.&nbsp; And we’ve safely reopened schools, helping our most vulnerable students have more equitable access to learning and easing the burden on working parents across rural and urban areas.<br><br>Tackling barriers to vaccinations, boosters, testing, and treatments remains a priority for us.&nbsp; This includes making sure people can access these tools for free, wherever you are, and even if you don’t have health insurance.&nbsp;<br><br>And we will continue to address the specific needs of seniors, people living with disabilities, and people who are immunocompromised.&nbsp; These are the Americans who need our focus and attention right now.&nbsp; These are our friends and neighbors,&nbsp;<em>nuestros padres y abuelos</em>&nbsp;&#8212; our family.<br><br>We see you, and we will do everything in our power to protect and support you, including making sure you have access to boosters and treatment.<br><br>Bottom line: As we move forward, we will leave no one behind.&nbsp; President Biden made that clear last night.</p>



<p>With that, let me turn it over to Jeff.&nbsp;<br><br>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Well, thank you, Secretary.<br><br>Now, moving to the second goal of the President’s plan: preparing for any new variants.&nbsp;<br><br>We know this virus is unpredictable, so the President’s plan makes clear we’re continuing to take every action within our power to prepare for any possible new variants.<br><br>As Dr. Walensky will discuss in a moment, we’ve taken significant steps to improve monitoring for any new variants.<br><br>America’s variant monitoring system can now detect variants at a very, very low level.&nbsp; If a new variant emerges, we’re able to catch it earlier, faster, and with greater precision.<br><br>And when we do detect a new variant, we’ll be ready to respond quickly.<br><br>We have a COVID-19 variant playbook to rapidly assess a variant’s transmissibility and severity, and its potential impact on vaccines and treatment.<br><br>We’ve put it to the test over the past few weeks with tabletop readiness and response exercises against a fictional variant with HHS, CDC, NIH, FDA, FEMA, and other agencies at the table.<br><br>If needed, we have developed plans and processes that we can produce, authorize, and deliver new vaccines and treatments in just 100 days rather than in many months or years.&nbsp; Funding from Congress will be critical to these efforts.&nbsp;<br><br>The President’s plan also creates new stockpiles of at-home tests, antiviral pills, and high-quality masks, including masks for kids.&nbsp; So, we’re ready for whatever comes.<br><br>Next, the third goal of the President’s plan: prevent economic and school shutdowns.<br><br>We know how to keep our businesses and our schools open with the tools that we have at our disposal.&nbsp; And we’ve shown we can do it, even during the Omicron surge.<br><br>Under the President’s plan, we’ll continue to ensure that our schools, workers, and workplaces have the resources they need.<br><br>This includes the Environmental Protection Agency &#8212; the EPA &#8212; issuing a new clean air in buildings checklist, a set of recommendations to improve indoor air quality through effective ventilation practices.&nbsp;<br><br>As we move forward, the President believes Americans should be able to stay home if they do get COVID so they can protect others and take care of themselves and their loved ones without the added burden of missing a paycheck.&nbsp;<br><br>That’s why the President’s plan calls on Congress to reinstate tax credits to help small- and mid-size businesses provide paid sick and family leave to those sick with COVID-19.&nbsp;<br><br>Last, the fourth goal of the President’s plan: vaccinating the world and saving lives.<br><br>Clearly, the virus does not recognize national borders.&nbsp; To protect the American people and our economy, we must defeat the virus everywhere.&nbsp; That means vaccinating Americans and vaccinating people around the world.&nbsp; It’s both the right thing to do and it is in our own national interest.<br><br>Under President Biden, the United States has led the global vaccination effort.&nbsp; We’re donating 1.2 billion doses to the world.&nbsp; In fact, we’ve already shipped 480 million doses in total to 112 countries for free &#8212; no strings attached.&nbsp; That’s four times as many doses shipped as any other country.<br><br>The President’s plan includes continuing to donate more vaccines and doubling down on efforts to turn those vaccines into vaccinations.<br><br>We’re going to help get shots in arms around the world by supporting public education efforts, providing vaccinators in the field, and setting up vaccination sites.&nbsp;<br><br>Now, let me turn to Dr. Walensky to provide more detail on CDC’s work to improve and expand tracking and monitoring of COVID variants.<br><br>And then over to Dr. Fauci to discuss NIH’s work to support the development of new treatments and next-generation vaccines.<br><br>Dr. Walensky.<br><br>DR. WALENSKY:&nbsp; Good morning, everyone.&nbsp; Thank you, Jeff.&nbsp; I’m delighted to be with you for today’s announcement.<br><br>As you heard from Jeff and Secretary Becerra, a key element of the President’s National COVID Preparedness Plan is building on the strengths of our public health response to COVID-19, expanding our capacity to respond to new variants, clusters of cases, or outbreaks so we can effectively stay ahead of this virus and protect more people.<br><br>Today, I want to discuss some of CDC’s strategies for monitoring the virus, alerting people in real-time, and adjusting our response as needed.&nbsp;<br><br>These approaches include our National Wastewater Surveillance System and the National Syndromic Surveillance Program to better anticipate a rise in cases; expanded genomic sequencing to quickly identify new variants; and our approach to data modernization and our new Center for Forecasting and Analytics, which is designed to forecast and model emerging health threats and to help inform public health decision making.<br><br>First, surveillance.&nbsp; Last month, CDC publicly released our National Wastewater Surveillance data.&nbsp;&nbsp;For SARS-CoV-2, wastewater can detect an increase in cases four to six days before we might see these cases show up through a rise in positive tests.<br><br>When it was first released publicly two weeks ago, data from the National Wastewater Surveillance System included 400 testing sites across the country in 212 communities, representing over 50 million people.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>With continued expansion, we now have 647 testing sites publicly reporting on COVID Data Tracker, and we are onboarding new sites each week.&nbsp; This adds to the National Syndromic Surveillance Program, which collects data on COVID-19 emergency visits from over 70 percent of emergency departments across the country to anticipate where cases are increasing.<br><br>Second, we are expanding our capacity in&nbsp;genomic surveillance so that we can readily detect variants of concern or interest.<br><br>Each week, CDC analyzes genomic sequences from all 50 states and uses these sequences to understand and map the spread of variants across the country, often&nbsp;sequencing tens of thousands of viral samples in a given week.&nbsp;&nbsp;These robust sequencing efforts mean we can reliably identify very low levels of variants, even variants that account for as little as 0.1 percent of all COVID-19 cases in the United States.<br><br>Finally, we continue to invest in and scale up our data modernization efforts, which improve COVID-19 data collection, reporting, analysis, and interoperability so America is better informed and ready to respond to whatever may come next.&nbsp; By connecting data from local public health to our national systems, we work to collect the data today that we will need to answer the critical questions of tomorrow.<br><br>These data can then be used by CDC’s Forecast &#8212; Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics to forecast and model our public health threats and inform our prevention recommendations.&nbsp; CDC is working with state, county, and city jurisdictions to transform independent, local surveillance efforts into a robust, sustainable national system.<br><br>And, we continue to build and strengthen our global collaborations and communication networks to better understand and respond to COVID-19 variants as they emerge.&nbsp; All of these efforts are with a vision for not just COVID, but also to address any future infectious and non-infectious public health threats.<br><br>As we continue to move forward from this pandemic, I&#8217;m confident that CDC and our public health partners are well positioned to use our surveillance and our data to lead the way.<br><br>Thank you.&nbsp; I’ll now turn things over to Dr. Fauci.<br><br>DR. FAUCI:&nbsp; Thanks, Dr. Walensky.<br><br>As Jeff said, vaccines and treatments are key parts of our toolkit moving forward.&nbsp;<br><br>In this regard, it is important to point out the unprecedented global research effort that brought us to where we are today in our capability to intervene against COVID.&nbsp; Decades of U.S. investment in fundamental biomedical research provided the foundation for the rapid design and development of COVID-19 vaccines.&nbsp;<br><br>This work includes but is not limited to groundbreaking, structure-based vaccine design by U.S. government scientists at the NIAID Vaccine Research Center.&nbsp;<br><br>As soon as the sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was made available in January of 2020, these researchers rapidly generated a stabilized spike protein as the optimal immunogen for use in vaccine development.</p>



<p>This crucial breakthrough led to the development, in association with industry partners, of multiple COVID-19 vaccine candidates, several of which are now authorized or approved by the FDA.<br><br>These vaccines have now been administered to billions of people around the world, including over 250 million in the United States.&nbsp; They are safe and they work.<br><br>Moving forward, we will continue to prioritize this vital research, including towards a pan-coronavirus vaccine.<br><br>Now, if new variants emerge, we now have faster processes to assess the impact of the virus on our vaccines.&nbsp; And this plan ensures that we are ready to deploy personnel and resources to quickly update the vaccines.<br><br>These expedited plans and processes will help us reach our goal that updated vaccines can be developed, approved, and manufactured in approximately 100 days.<br><br>While we would always rather prevent a case of COVID-19 than treat one, we do have a growing number of therapeutic options, including monoclonal antibodies and antiviral drugs.<br><br>This, too, is a victory for science.&nbsp; NIH-supported basic research and clinical trials infrastructure within the United States and around the world helped the scientific community, in collaboration with our industrial partners, to undertake rigorously designed studies to give us robust data, not just speculation or anecdotes, about safety and efficacy of various treatment options.<br><br>As we face the threat of the Omicron variant, we are fortunate to have several powerful medications that work to keep people out of the hospital.&nbsp; The most recent of these is the Eli Lilly monoclonal antibody co-discovered by NIAID scientists and their collaborators in industry, which is already going out across the country.&nbsp; This powerful medicine works against all the variants that we’ve tested it against.<br><br>And Pfizer’s antivirals are highly effective at reducing the risk of hospitalization and death.&nbsp; One million courses are available just this month.<br><br>Also, the plan announced today calls for continued investment in treatment research for COVID-19.<br><br>NIH also established the COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel to provide up-to-date recommendations to healthcare providers throughout the world regarding specific COVID-19 treatments based on the best available science.&nbsp; The panel meets regularly to evaluate possible treatment options for COVID-19, and they update the guidelines as new clinical evidence emerges.<br><br>However, our work is certainly not done.<br><br>The scientific community continues to conduct vital research to learn more about SARS-CoV-2 and the body’s immune response both during and following infection so that we can adapt and improve vaccines and treatments.&nbsp; In addition, as Secretary Becerra mentioned, we are working to understand better, prevent, and intervene in Long COVID.<br><br>We know that we will have to contend with COVID at some level for some time to come.&nbsp; Thus, we will continue to invest in research to develop better treatments and next-generation vaccines, ones that could provide even broader and longer-lasting protection.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This ongoing research investment is not only helping us turn the corner on COVID-19 but also is vital to preparing us for future pandemics.&nbsp;<br><br>With that, I will turn it back over to you, Jeff.</p>



<p>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Well, thank you, Doctors.<br><br>Let me close with this: By protecting against and treating COVID, preparing for any new variants, preventing economic and school shutdowns, and vaccinating the world and saving lives, the President’s COVID-19 Preparedness Plan will enable us to move forward safely, to get back to our more normal routines.<br><br>The President’s Plan is robust and comprehensive.&nbsp; And I want to emphasize that execution of the President’s Plan requires additional funding.<br><br>HHS has laid out some immediate funding needs for Congress.&nbsp; We’ll need additional funding for medium- and longer-term priorities, and we’ll be working with Congress in the weeks ahead.<br><br>President Biden came into office facing the worst public health crisis in more than a century.<br><br>Over the past 13 months, we’ve leveraged the full force of the federal government to fight COVID.&nbsp; And together, with the leadership of governors and local health officials, the innovation of the private sector, and the determination of the American people, we have made tremendous progress.<br><br>We’ve delivered the tools Americans need to protect themselves, reopened our schools, and gotten our economy moving again.<br><br>The President’s Plan will build on that progress.&nbsp; And with congressional support, we look forward to executing this plan in the year ahead.<br><br>With that, Kevin, let’s open it up for questions.<br><br>Kevin?<br><br>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Thanks, Jeff.&nbsp; We have a good amount of questions today and some limited time, so let’s keep it to one question.</p>



<p>First, let’s go to Jeremy Diamond at CNN.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey, thanks, all, for doing this.&nbsp; I’m curious &#8212; a couple things.&nbsp; First of all, when will it be the appropriate time to remove the domestic travel mask mandate, given the lowered risk of COVID and your new plan?</p>



<p>And secondly, you know, when you say and when the President said last night that you want to start treating this disease like others and having it be less disruptive to people&#8217;s daily lives, do you foresee a time where people no longer need to isolate when they test positive for COVID, particularly if they don&#8217;t have symptoms?&nbsp; Thanks.<br><br>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Okay, why don&#8217;t I take the first question, which was on domestic air travel.&nbsp; And then Dr. Walensky.</p>



<p>Last week&#8217;s guidance from CDC on masking did not change air and rail travel requirements, including the requirements to wear a mask on public transportation.&nbsp; Those requirements are currently in place through March 18th, and they’ll continue to be so while we evaluate &#8212; leading up to March 18th &#8212; the duration of the requirement based on the state of the virus.</p>



<p>So, no change, but an evaluation taking place at this point.</p>



<p>Dr. Walensky?<br><br>DR. WALENSKY:&nbsp; Yeah, thank you for that question, Jeremy.</p>



<p>We always prefer to have people who might be infectious with an infectious disease home and not transmitting to others, certainly during your most infectious period of time &#8212; that first two or three before your symptoms and the two or three days after your symptoms is the time that you&#8217;re most infectious.</p>



<p>Certainly, we may consider to revisit that at some future time.&nbsp; But right now, with about 68,000 cases around the country daily, we&#8217;re not looking at revisiting that right now.</p>



<p>Next question.<br><br>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Let&#8217;s go to Cheyenne Haslett at ABC.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; I want to ask about one-way masking, since that seems to be the advice for anyone who isn&#8217;t ready to take their mask off yet and particularly kids under five or immunocompromised people.</p>



<p>So, specifically, what do you need to wear to ensure that you&#8217;re protected if you&#8217;re one-way masking?&nbsp; I know we&#8217;ve spoken about N95s, but if they&#8217;re not available to kids and aren&#8217;t very comfortable, can we lean on surgical masks or KN95s as good enough?</p>



<p>And my second question is: How much funding does this plan require in total?<br><br>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Dr. Walensky, on masking?<br><br>DR. WALENSKY:&nbsp; Yeah, certainly.&nbsp; So, certainly, the best possible mask is one that you can keep on for a durable period of time.&nbsp; We have commented on our CDC website, and we have guidance for this, that you certainly want two-layered masks, something that fits snugly over your nose and mouth, generally with a wire bridge.</p>



<p>Of course, if you can tolerate a better-fitting mask, a higher-quality mask for a longer period of time, those are always preferred.&nbsp; So those would be your N95s and your KN95s, and then, as well, your surgical masks.</p>



<p>So, all of those data are complete on our CDC website.&nbsp; But really, we want to make sure that people can tolerate them for long periods of time and, if you can, that you increase the quality of the mask you wear.<br><br>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; I think your second question was on funding.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll handle that.</p>



<p>HHS and the State Department, along with USAID, have identified and briefed bipartisan leaders in Congress on the near-term funding that is needed.&nbsp; This includes resources to secure more medical supplies, including vaccines, treatments, and boosters; sustaining the testing capacity in the country; investing, as Dr. Fauci talked, about in research and development of next-generation vaccines, including pan-coronavirus vaccines; and accelerating vaccine uptake globally.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s clearly broad support from the American people for securing these critical medical supplies so we&#8217;re protected and we&#8217;re prepared for any possible variant.</p>



<p>We will need additional funding beyond these immediate needs to effectively execute on the medium- and longer-term priorities and policies in today&#8217;s plan.</p>



<p>As we finalize these numbers, we will communicate that with Congress and look forward to working closely with Congress going forward.</p>



<p>Next question, please.</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Let’s go to Tamara Keith at NPR.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you for taking my question.&nbsp; Related to the masks, leads to another question &#8212; what about Title 42 that is in effect as a public health emergency?&nbsp; Dr. Walensky, are you reconsidering the status of Title 42, along with some of the other guidance?</p>



<p>Additionally, I noticed that Secretary Becerra is here at this briefing as you all move from a crisis footing to more of a long-term management mode.&nbsp; Are you shifting primary management of COVID to HHS from the White House?<br><br>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Dr. Walensky?</p>



<p>DR. WALENSKY:&nbsp; Yeah, great.&nbsp; Thank you, Tamara.&nbsp; So, we continue to reevaluate Title 42 every several weeks, every four to eight weeks, and we will continue to do so throughout the duration of time of this pandemic.<br><br>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; On Secretary Becerra, I&#8217;ll go first.&nbsp; And if you want to &#8212;</p>



<p>SECRETARY BECERRA:&nbsp; Sure.</p>



<p>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; &#8212; add anything.&nbsp; As I&#8217;ve said before, Secretary Becerra has been an essential partner throughout the COVID response, and that work continues going forward.</p>



<p>The Secretary is leading many of the critical COVID efforts at HHS, like managing the operational and logistical structure to deliver hundreds of millions of vaccines, tests, and treatments across the country; focusing on the long-term impacts of COVID, as he discussed today, like Long COVID, mental health challenges, and the tragedy of losing someone they love.</p>



<p>So this is very much business as usual.&nbsp; We have a very close working relationship and partnership, talking and meeting many times, most weeks.&nbsp; Secretary Becerra?</p>



<p>SECRETARY BECERRA:&nbsp; I’ll only add that, from the beginning, the President put together a team, and that&#8217;s the way it&#8217;s continued to work.&nbsp; HHS is a principal partner in that team.&nbsp;<br><br>H-CORE, the new organization that I mentioned, is going to be indispensable for the execution of this plan.&nbsp; And H-CORE has learned from the lessons that we saw from Operation Warp Speed, when DOD had more jurisdiction and was more in charge.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>But now that it is permanently housed here at HHS, you&#8217;ll continue to see much of the execution, once the plans are in place and the President gives a signal, emanating from HHS, as you can see from the presentations today.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>So, it&#8217;s all the team effort, and it&#8217;s about getting the job done.<br><br>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Next question, please.<br><br>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Emma Court at Bloomberg.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, thanks for holding this.&nbsp; I was hoping you could speak about how confident the government is about its COVID monitoring systems moving forward, especially given that so many of the precautions are now being relaxed.&nbsp; Will we have enough notice if another surge develops?</p>



<p>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Dr. Walensky?</p>



<p>DR. WALENSKY:&nbsp; Yeah, so that is instrumental in what we&#8217;ve been doing.&nbsp; We have great collaborations globally so that if a variant were to &#8212; of concern were to emerge globally, we are in touch globally.&nbsp;<br><br>And then we have all of the systems that we talked about &#8212; our wastewater system; our syndromic surveillance system; our genomic surveillance system; our enhanced genomic surveillance system, which is how we found a case of Omicron within days of knowing that it existed in other countries.</p>



<p>So, yes, we are confident.&nbsp; We continue to scale up these efforts and are grateful for the resources from Congress to be able to do so.<br><br>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Next question, please.<br><br>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Let’s go to Sheryl Stolberg, New York Times.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you for doing this call.&nbsp; A couple of questions.&nbsp; First, to Dr. Walensky, we&#8217;re still at about 60,000 cases a day, which is more than five times the low of June 2021.&nbsp; So I&#8217;m wondering: Is there a threshold of daily cases at which you would feel comfortable recommending that the travel mask mandate be lifted?</p>



<p>And then, for Dr. Fauci, I&#8217;m interested in the likelihood of a universal coronavirus vaccine.&nbsp; A flu &#8212; universal flu vaccine has been a dream for a long time and it hasn&#8217;t happened, so how soon would you envision a universal coronavirus vaccine?<br><br>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Dr. Walensky, first.<br><br>DR. WALENSKY:&nbsp; Yeah, I want to just comment, Sheryl, that the qualitative &#8212; how these cases are in February or March of 2022 is just very different than where we were in June of 2021.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>And that is because of all the tools that we have now.&nbsp; It&#8217;s because Omicron in general is a milder variant.&nbsp; But it&#8217;s also because of the massive amount of vaccination we&#8217;ve been doing, the massive amount of boosting we&#8217;ve been doing, as well as the protection that we can get from our therapeutics in this moment.&nbsp; So I think that it&#8217;s not necessary that we compare it exactly the same number of cases.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>That said, I will also say that we will be revisiting the the March &#8212; in the middle of March, the testing &#8212; the travel &#8212; the masking for travel order, and more to come on that.</p>



<p>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Dr. Fauci?</p>



<p>DR. FAUCI:&nbsp; Yeah, Sheryl, well, when one thinks of a pan-coronavirus vaccine, it really is going to be an incremental process.&nbsp; So if you look at the entire phylogenetic tree of coronavirus &#8212; there are many, many coronaviruses, some of which are even the common cold coronaviruses that we&#8217;ve all experienced prior to COVID-19, generally year after year accounting for anywhere from 5 to 30 percent of the common colds.</p>



<p>Then there&#8217;s the beta-coronaviruses, which include not only SARS-CoV-2 but SARS-CoV-1, MERS, and others, and they are in another category of the beta-coronaviruses.</p>



<p>So when you ask about pan-coronavirus, that&#8217;s quite aspirational.&nbsp; And if we ever get there, that will take years.&nbsp; But what we&#8217;re focusing on first is a pan-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, which means a vaccine that would be highly effective against ancestral strain &#8212; Alpha, Beta, Delta, Omicron &#8212; or any future SARS-CoV-2 that we might experience.&nbsp; I believe that is much, much closer than the pan-coronavirus vaccine.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The reason I can&#8217;t give you a timeframe is that when you&#8217;re in the element of discovery, as opposed to full development, you do not know when you will get the right situation, be it an immunogen or a platform or what have you.&nbsp; We are working intensively on that discovery phase.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once you get a particular candidate that fulfills certain criteria, then, if you asked me that question again, Sheryl, I could give you an approximation of how long it would take.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>But right now, we&#8217;re making good progress.&nbsp; We have several candidates that look good &#8212; some are in preclinical, some are in phase one.</p>



<p>So we will keep you posted.&nbsp; And I hope that you keep coming back and asking that question, because as we get more and more discovery, we&#8217;ll have a better approximation of when we will get to that goal.<br><br>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Next question, please.</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Let’s go to Zeke Miller at the AP.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks for doing this.&nbsp; First, simply to follow up on Jeremy&#8217;s question regarding air travel, what&#8217;s the science that says that people should wear masks on planes and on trains but don&#8217;t need to wear one at a, you know, crowded movie theater or arena?</p>



<p>Separately, does the CDC believe that schools in places that are in &#8212; have low spread should recommend that students not wear masks, given the potential unintended consequences that mask-wearing has had on children&#8217;s education?</p>



<p>And then more broadly, the President&#8217;s message last night was that people should be, you know, going back to work, we should would fill downtowns again.&nbsp; How does the administration plan to, sort, of get people to overcome three years of shutdown anxiety and work-from-home tendencies to actually go back and resume their normal activities?<br><br>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Okay, Zeke, you had a couple masking questions there.</p>



<p>DR. WALENSKY:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; One was airplanes.&nbsp; Second was &#8212;</p>



<p>DR. WALENSKY:&nbsp; Schools.</p>



<p>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; &#8212; schools with low transmission.&nbsp; And then you had the federal workforce.&nbsp;&nbsp;So why don’t we turn it to Dr. Walensky on the masking questions and then I’ll handle the federal workforce.</p>



<p>DR. WALENSKY:&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; So, just in terms of travel, we have to look not only at the science with regard to transmission in masks but also the epidemiology and the frequency that we may encounter a variant of concern or a variant of interest in our travel corridors.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>So, all of those go into our equations, in terms of how much diseases out there, as well as the science, and as well as the control people have when they enter those travel quarters.&nbsp;&nbsp;We &#8212; people rely on those quarters for getting to work and for, you know, other reasons.&nbsp; So, that&#8217;s among the reasons that we want to revisit this in a separate way.&nbsp;<br><br>In terms of schools: As we released last Friday, we are confident in our guidance from last Friday that schools can now follow the COVID-19 community levels in terms of their masking recommendations.&nbsp;<br><br>Those recommendations, if you recall, is to maintain masking if you are in an area that is orange or high-level community COVID-19 level, and that you could remove those masks if you are yellow or green &#8212; where, in yellow, if you are high &#8212; are at high risk, that you would want to consult your healthcare provider to give you some advice as to whether you would want to continue.<br><br>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; On the federal workforce and the workforce more generally: Throughout the pandemic, more than 4 million federal employees had been very hard at work protecting our country and providing critical services.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Over the past year, we&#8217;ve made significant progress in the COVID response.&nbsp; And thanks to their efforts, people working from home can feel safe to begin to return to the office.&nbsp; We&#8217;re doing that here in the federal government.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Across the coming weeks, the vast majority of federal workers will once again work in person.&nbsp; You&#8217;ll see public-facing federal government offices open for longer hours, more in-person appointments and walkups services.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>You know, more generally, on worker safety: OSHA, at the Department of Labor, will update workplace guidance to better equip employees with the tools they need to ensure safer workplaces, including information, as we talked about earlier, on ventilation.<br><br>We will work with Congress to provide paid sick leave to workers who need to miss work due to a case of COVID-19 or to care for a loved one who has COVID-19.&nbsp; We want to reinstate the tax credits to help small and midsize businesses provide paid sick and family leave.&nbsp;<br><br>Next question.&nbsp;<br><br>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Let&#8217;s go to Alex Nazaryan at Yahoo!<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Hi, thank you.&nbsp; Can you speak broadly to what else can be done to move us past the emergency stage of the pandemic?&nbsp; That&#8217;s clearly the message that we heard from the President last night. And how do we articulate that &#8212; how do you articulate that message in the weeks and months to come, you know, assuming that we don&#8217;t have some new variant?<br><br>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Dr. Fauci, do you want to start there?<br><br>DR. FAUCI:&nbsp; Well, you know, when you say “emergency” &#8212; “emergency” means different things to different people.&nbsp; We are still in a situation right now where, as you know, we have about 68,000 cases.&nbsp; We are coming down in the right direction.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>We hope &#8212; and I believe we will get there &#8212; all the parameters that we have, pointing to this as well as the interventions that we have &#8212; that we will reach a stage where &#8212; further and further down to the point where some people call it “living with the virus,” some people call it “endemic.”&nbsp; If that is not an emergency, then, in fact, we&#8217;re out of the emergency situation.&nbsp;<br><br>But remember, whenever you talk about this, the thing you always must keep saying: We always must be prepared for the eventuality of another variant.<br><br>So we can go living our lives the way we&#8217;ve just described, the way Jeff and what Dr. Walensky and what the President described last night.&nbsp; We are in that situation where we can do that.&nbsp;<br><br>That doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean that the definition of an emergency, where there are other things that are important that one can do in much greater ease when you&#8217;re in a situation where you&#8217;re officially in an emergency.&nbsp;<br><br>But right now, if you look at the practicality of where we are, we are clearly going in the right direction. &nbsp;And with all the interventions we have, I believe that we are prepared for the possibility that we will get another variant with regard to vaccines, boosters, testing, good masks, and antivirals.<br><br>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; I would just add on to what Dr. Fauci said that, you know, over the past year, we&#8217;ve made significant progress and are in a very different position than we were when President Biden took office, with 215 million people fully vaccinated; two out of three eligible adults boosted; multiple treatment options, which we&#8217;ve talked about today, including millions of lifesaving pills; free at-home testing; 400 million high-quality masks going out for free.&nbsp; And because of this progress and the widely available nature of these tools, we&#8217;ve reached a new moment in the fight with COVID-19.<br><br>Today, we are in a position to move forward safely and to get back to our more normal routines.&nbsp; Today&#8217;s plan has been in the making for a long time.&nbsp; We started in early January.&nbsp; It was developed with the input from dozens of experts, local public health leaders, governors and partners across our federal agencies.&nbsp; And with additional support from Congress, we’ll ensure we protect more people with COVID &#8212; from COVID going forward, that we’re prepared for new variants, and we prevent shutdowns.<br><br>At the same time, I think it&#8217;s important to note that there is more work ahead of us.&nbsp; You know, we&#8217;ll roll out vaccines for kids ages two to five.&nbsp; It&#8217;s authorized by FDA and recommended by CDC.&nbsp; We’ll launch the &#8220;Test to Treat&#8221; initiative so people can get tested and treated for free in one stop.&nbsp; And we&#8217;ll create new stockpiles of tests, pills, and masks so we have the tools ready to deploy if we need them.&nbsp;<br><br>So the President was very clear, as Dr. Fauci said, that we need to be prepared for any possible variant and invest in the next level &#8212; the next generation of treatments and vaccines.<br><br>Funding from Congress will be critical for these efforts so we’ll be working very closely with Capitol Hill going forward.<br><br>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Next question.<br><br>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Last question.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s go to Pedro Rojas at Univision.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Just wanted to give &#8212; make a question to Secretary Becerra.&nbsp; (Speaks Spanish.)<br><br>SECRETARY BECERRA:&nbsp; (Speaks Spanish.)<br><br>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; I want to thank everybody for today&#8217;s briefing.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s wonderful to be getting back to our more normal routine and to be doing these briefings with my colleagues in person.&nbsp;<br><br>So, thank you, everybody.<br><br>11:30 A.M. EST</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>Today, the United States, in coordination with Allies and partners, is imposing additional economic costs on Russia and Belarus in response to President Putin’s brutal invasion of Ukraine. The United States will take actions to hold Belarus accountable for enabling Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, weaken the Russian defense sector and its military power for years to come, target Russia’s most important sources of wealth, and ban Russian airlines from U.S. airspace.</p>



<p>As a result of our historic, multilateral coordination, Russia has become a global economic and financial pariah. Over 30 countries representing well over half the world’s economy have announced sanctions and export controls targeting Russia. Russia is further isolated from the international financial and trade system. We are preventing Putin from accessing his war chest to soften the blow of our actions and support his invasion of Ukraine. The United States and governments all over the world are going after Putin’s cronies and their families by identifying and freezing the assets they hold in our respective jurisdictions – their yachts, luxury apartments, money, and other ill-gotten gains. And the United States and our Allies are acting in concert to minimize the impact of these measures on our economies, including through a coordinated release of 60 million barrels of oil from strategic reserves. We will continue to impose costs with Allies and partners so long as Putin continues to escalate.</p>



<p>Today’s actions include:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Sweeping restrictions on Belarus to choke off its import of technological goods in response to its support of Putin’s war of choice. </strong>The Department of Commerce will extend the stringent export control policies put in place for Russia to Belarus. This action will help prevent diversion of items, technologies, and software through Belarus to Russia and will significantly degrade both countries’ ability to sustain their military aggression and project power. This will severely limit the ability of Russia and Belarus to obtain the materials they need to support their military aggression against Ukraine, project power in ways that threaten regional stability and undermine global peace and security.<br></li><li><strong>Full blocking sanctions on Russian defense entities. </strong>The Department of State will impose sweeping sanctions that target Russia’s defense sector to further restrict Putin’s war machine. This action will impose significant costs on Russian weapon development and production companies. In total, 22 Russian defense-related entities will be designated, including firms that make combat aircraft, infantry fighting vehicles, electronic warfare systems, missiles, and unmanned aerial vehicles for Russia’s military.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Export Controls Targeting Oil Refining, a Key Revenue Source that Supports Russian Military. </strong>Through export controls on oil and gas extraction equipment, the Commerce Department will impose restrictions on technology exports that would support Russia’s refining capacity over the long term. The United States and our Allies and partners do not have a strategic interest in reducing the global supply of energy – which is why we have carved out energy payments from our financial sanctions. But we and our Allies and partners share a strong interest in degrading Russia’s status as a leading energy supplier over time. These actions will help further that goal, while protecting American consumers.<br></li><li><strong>Targeting Entities Supporting the Russian and Belarusian Military. </strong>The Commerce Department, in coordination with its interagency partners, will add entities that have been involved in, contributed to, or otherwise supported the Russian and Belarusian security services, military and defense sectors, and/or military and defense research and development efforts to the Entity List. These actions will ensure that the military as well as the aerospace, maritime and high-technology sectors do not obtain U.S. technology goods and technology that can be used to support Russian technical maintenance and innovation. <br></li><li><strong>Banning Russian aircraft from entering and using domestic U.S. airspace.</strong> As the President announced, the United States will close off American air space to all Russian flights – further isolating Russia – and adding an additional squeeze on its economy. This includes aircraft certified, operated, registered or controlled by any person connected with Russia. This includes revoking all Russian airlines’ – both passenger and cargo – ability to operate to and from U.S. destinations, as well as refusing entry of any Russian-operated aircraft into U.S. airspace. With this action, the United States stands with over 30 of the world’s most important aviation markets in denying Russian carriers the ability to conduct business.</li></ul>
