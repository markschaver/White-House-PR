<p>Today, President Joe Biden spoke with the leadership of Walmart and Target, and the infant formula manufacturers Reckitt and Gerber to receive an update on actions the companies are taking to address the shortage of infant formula caused by a voluntary recall of infant powdered formula by Abbott and the subsequent closure of its manufacturing facility in Sturgis, Michigan.</p>



<p>The manufacturers and retailers thanked the President for the actions his administration has taken—including those by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the U.S. Department of Agriculture—that has enabled them to serve the families in need, including low income mothers and children who are most vulnerable.</p>



<p>The President discussed Reckitt and Gerber’s efforts to increase production—which have made up for much of the loss of production by Abbott—and pledged to work closely with them to identify ways the Administration can help, on top of the actions being announced today. Both companies stated that they are operating 24/7 with Gerber, increasing the amount of their infant formula available to consumers by approximately 50% in March and April. Reckitt is supplying more than 30% more product year to date.</p>



<p>The conversation with the CEOs of Walmart and Target focused on how retailers are working to stock shelves. The CEOs discussed state specific disparities and the President asked what more his team can do to help move product and get more product to communities in need. These calls build off the work the Administration has done since February to increase the supply of infant formula.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>President Biden will welcome the leaders of the Association of Southeast Nations (ASEAN) for a historic U.S.-ASEAN Special Summit, held for the first time in Washington D.C. and at the White House, to re-affirm the United States’ enduring commitment to Southeast Asia and underscore the importance of U.S.-ASEAN cooperation in ensuring security, prosperity, and respect for human rights.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Over many years, the United States has steadily deepened our partnership with Southeast Asia. The United States has provided over $12.1 billion in development, economic, health, and security assistance to Southeast Asian allies and partners since 2002 and over that same period of time, the United States has provided over $1.4 billion in humanitarian assistance, including life-saving disaster assistance, emergency food aid, and support to refugees throughout Southeast Asia. Building on our long-standing commitment to this critical region, the Biden-Harris Administration’s FY 2023 Budget Request included over $800 million in bilateral assistance for ASEAN partners and over $25 million to deepen relations with ASEAN and enhance ASEAN’s capacity to tackle pressing regional challenges.&nbsp;<br><br>The United States and Southeast Asia also benefit from our far-reaching commercial and trade ties. ASEAN represents the world’s fourth largest market and the United States is ASEAN’s largest source of foreign direct investment, while our two-way trade amounted to over $360 billion in 2020.&nbsp;<br><br>U.S.-ASEAN relations are ultimately anchored in the special friendship shared by our combined one billion people. Our ongoing commitment to deepening people-to-people ties is marked by 7000 programs at 83 American Spaces in ASEAN countries, the Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative’s&nbsp;155,000 alumni, and the connections forged through nearly 6 million U.S. visas, including student visas, granted to Southeast Asian travelers since 2010.<br><br>At the annual U.S.-ASEAN Summit in October 2021, President Biden announced an unprecedented investment of up to $102 million in U.S.-ASEAN relations, significantly expanding our cooperation on health, climate, science and innovation, trade facilitation, education, and more. Today, the&nbsp;United States and ASEAN will inaugurate a new era of partnership, guided by the complementary objectives of the Indo-Pacific Strategy of the United States and the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific. In that spirit,&nbsp;President Biden is announcing over $150 million in initiatives which we expect will mobilize billions more in private financing that will deepen U.S.-ASEAN relations, strengthen ASEAN centrality, and expand our common capacity to achieve our shared objectives.<br><br><strong>ACCELERATING CLIMATE ACTION, SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT, AND INCLUSIVE PROSPERITY</strong><br><br>In support of U.S.-ASEAN Climate Futures and U.S.-ASEAN Economic Futures, the United States and ASEAN will raise our collective climate ambition while working together to support implementation of the Master Plan on ASEAN Connectivity 2025.&nbsp;&nbsp;We will help meet the region’s enormous infrastructure needs in a sustainable manner that accelerates the clean energy transition, helps the region to achieve a path to net zero emissions by mid-century, and drives inclusive, broad-based prosperity.</p>



<ul><li>Investing in Clean Energy Infrastructure: Through the Southeast Asia Smart Power Program, the United States will invest $40 million in order to mobilize $2 billion in blended financing for clean energy infrastructure in Southeast Asia, thereby decarbonizing and strengthening the region’s power system, increasing regional energy trade, and accelerating the deployment of clean energy technologies.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>U.S.-ASEAN Forest Future Initiative: The United States is committed to working with ASEAN to fight deforestation and accelerate the regional transition to sustainable, climate-positive forest economies – a critical step in achieving ASEAN countries’ climate and development goals.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<ul><li>Mobilizing Finance at Scale: The United States is launching a new platform, bringing together members of the Forest Investor Club, leaders from the United States and ASEAN in the financial sector, conservation and community engagement organizations, agriculture and forestry companies, and governments, to deliver a coordinated approach for natural capital finance. This initiative, subject to appropriate procedures and requirements, aims to mobilize $1 billion in capital investment across the region toward sustainable forestry, forest restoration, and responsible land use.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li><li>ASEAN Nature Finance Innovation Roundtable: The U.S. Agency for International Development, the Department of State, and the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation will convene an ASEAN Nature Finance Innovation Roundtable to catalyze the use of innovative financial mechanisms and mobilize additional&nbsp;finance to support the long-term conservation, restoration, and sustainable management of critical ecosystems in Southeast Asia.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>&nbsp;U.S.-ASEAN Climate Solutions Hub: The United States is launching a U.S.-ASEAN Climate Solutions Hub, which will provide technical assistance to ASEAN countries in order to accelerate implementation of their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and related low-emission development and resilience strategies. This demand-driven initiative will support renewable energy deployment, decarbonization of the transportation sector, methane reduction efforts, and sustainable agriculture, forestry, and land management. It will also support the development of energy and land-use frameworks and measures that mobilize public and private finance and achieve just transitions.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>The&nbsp;U.S.-ASEAN Transportation Dialogue Partnership: The Department of Transportation will launch new air, land, and maritime transportation programs that promote safety, sustainable and resilient infrastructure, regional connectivity, and emerging transport technologies.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>The&nbsp;U.S.-ASEAN Alliance for Protected Area Conservation<strong>:&nbsp;</strong>The Department of the Interior, including the National Park Service, will collaborate with their counterparts in Southeast Asia to expand conservation and reverse deforestation. U.S. rangers will travel to Southeast Asia to share best practices and improve protected area management across the region, emphasizing nature-based climate solutions, sustainable tourism and visitor management, traditional knowledge and access to resources, and transboundary habitat connectivity.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Promoting Investment in Climate-Smart Infrastructure: The U.S. Trade and Development Agency is launching new initiatives intended to catalyze over $13&nbsp;billion in financing for clean energy projects that advance ASEAN’s net zero goals, while leveraging over $1 billion in public and private financing for investment in digital infrastructure and smart cities in Southeast Asia.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Space Cooperation: The United States will invest in the SERVIR initiative to share&nbsp;satellite data&nbsp;across ASEAN in support of climate monitoring and environmental forecasting, disaster management, and food security analysis.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Reducing Methane Emissions:&nbsp;The United States is committed to working with the nations of Southeast Asia to reduce the region’s methane emissions. The United States welcomed Indonesia, Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Singapore joining the Global Methane Pledge at COP-26, and we are accelerating technical assistance, financial resources, and project pipeline development for methane mitigation in Global Methane Pledge countries, including through the EPA, USTDA, DFC, and EXIM, as well as the newly-created&nbsp;Global Methane Hub, a&nbsp;​philanthropic fund that can support methane mitigation priorities in the region.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Trade Winds Business Forum: The Department of Commerce will hold its 2023 flagship trade mission – Trade Winds Business Forum – in Southeast Asia. U.S. companies from a wide range of industries will have the opportunity to pursue new commercial and trade opportunities in the region, building on the 2022 U.S. trade missions to Southeast Asia focused on clean energy, healthcare, and advanced manufacturing.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Accelerating Digital Development:&nbsp;The United States will advance digital development across Southeast Asia through a new $6 million regional initiative that will, in line with the ASEAN Digital Integration Framework Action Plan, support innovation, strengthen digital economy rule-making, facilitate public-private connections, strengthen digital policymaking, and support the adoption of global standards in artificial intelligence.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p><strong>SUPPORTING ACCESS TO EDUCATION&nbsp;</strong><br><br>The strength of U.S.-ASEAN relations is anchored in the friendship shared by our combined one billion people. Each year the United States provides more than $70 million to support educational and cultural exchanges that foster greater understanding, enhance cooperation, and create lifelong friendships that increase the strength and resilience of our communities over the long term.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>U.S.-ASEAN Institute for Rising Leaders at the School of Advanced International Studies: The Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) will launch the U.S.-ASEAN Institute for Rising Leaders, an innovative program to bring exceptional public servants from ASEAN governments to the United States for professional and leadership training. Through private funding, including from Boeing, UPS, PhRMA, and JPMorgan Chase and Co., the program will sponsor up to 30 mid-career public-service professionals each year – up to three from each of the ten ASEAN countries – to attend a tailored, intensive multi-week leadership-development program. The Institute will hone the academic, leadership, and policy-making skills of emerging Southeast Asian leaders and lay a robust foundation for deepening the U.S.-ASEAN partnership – between governments, businesses, and individuals – for years to come.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Expanding Youth Engagement: The Department of State will double the size of the Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative (YSEALI) program within three years, such that 900 emerging leaders will benefit from YSEALI’s academic and professional opportunities every year.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Cooperation in Higher Education: The U.S. government, alongside American companies and universities, is committed to increasing connectivity among educational institutions in the United States and Southeast Asia, while providing new opportunities for students and workers in ASEAN countries to study in the United States or develop critical skills at home.<br>&nbsp;<ul><li>Billion Futures Scholarships: A new cohort of Billion Futures Scholars will begin their studies in U.S. universities across the United States in Fall 2022, joining the 100 Scholars currently in the United States for undergraduate and graduate study, adding $5 million in new funding to our Billion Futures commitment.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li><li>U.S.-ASEAN University Connections: The Department of State will launch a new exchange program through which 20 academic fellows from universities across ASEAN will travel to the United States, exchange best practices with U.S. academics, and explore opportunities for collaborative research and teaching initiatives.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Fulbright ASEAN Scholars: The Department of State will double the size of the Fulbright U.S.-ASEAN Visiting Scholarship Program, such that a wider range of ASEAN academics, government officials, and civil society leaders can travel to the United States to undertake research on topics of importance to the U.S.-ASEAN relationship.<br>&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>English Language Training: The Department of State will significantly&nbsp;expand English language programs in Southeast Asia with a new $3 million investment that will provide capacity-building support for hundreds of thousands of English teachers in the region.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Private Sector Initiatives: Leading American companies have announced new initiatives to increase opportunities for education, training, and upskilling in Southeast Asia. Google will equip 200,000 small and medium enterprises in Southeast Asia with the skills to grow their business, through a $4 million grant to The Asia Foundation’s “Go Digital ASEAN,” and the U.S. Department of State and Google will partner to build digital literacy among youth at American Spaces located in Southeast Asia.&nbsp;HP is providing more than 20,000 students in Indonesia with technology and entrepreneurship skills through five HP Tech Hubs, while 3M is supporting science, technology, engineering, and math education for girls across Southeast Asia. The U.S. ASEAN Business Council Institute has launched a Myanmar Scholarship Fund to support students in the United States whose higher education journeys were disrupted by the crisis in Myanmar.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p><strong>EXPANDING MARITIME COOPERATION</strong><br><br>The United States is committed to supporting implementation of the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific’s Maritime Pillar. Today we are announcing&nbsp;$60 million in new regional maritime initiatives, most of which will be led by the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG).&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Personnel and Presence: The USCG will deploy assets and assign additional personnel to the Indo-Pacific to help meet partners’ requests for maritime training and capacity-building, to include a USCG attaché at the U.S. Mission to ASEAN.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Countering Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated Fishing: The Department of State, Department of Labor, and USCG will launch new initiatives to help ASEAN counties counter illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing and strengthen the capacity of ASEAN sectoral bodies to prevent forced labor in the fishing industry.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Indo-Pacific Support Platform: The USCG will deploy a cutter to Southeast Asia and Oceania for security cooperation and to operate as a training platform. This cutter will deploy throughout the region providing multinational crewing opportunities, conduct training missions, and participate in cooperative maritime engagements.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Excess Defense Articles: As USCG decommissions cutters, the service will prioritize the transfer of ships to Southeast Asian countries to increase the coastal nations’ maritime law enforcement capacity and promote a free and open Pacific.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Southeast Asia Training Team:&nbsp;The Department of State and USCG will expand USCG support to maritime law enforcement agencies in Southeast Asia by placing a training team in the region for the first time with additional dedicated support from U.S.-based trainers. These technical experts will provide capacity-building for the regional partners’ maritime law enforcement agencies in the areas of institutional development, readiness, sustainment of equipment, and workforce professionalization.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Emergency Training: The USCG and the Department of State will provide new trainings on energy safeguards, protection of critical maritime infrastructure, and all-hazards response.</li></ul>



<p><strong>PROMOTING GLOBAL HEALTH AND HEALTH SECURITY&nbsp;</strong><br><br>In support of U.S.-ASEAN Health Futures,&nbsp;the United States and ASEAN are taking swift action to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, strengthen health systems, and promote health security. The United States is proud to have provided over $200 million in COVID-19 assistance through the Department of State and USAID and donated over 115 million doses of safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines in Southeast Asia, with more on the way.</p>



<ul><li>Enhancing Pan-Respiratory Diseases Surveillance: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), through its new regional office in Hanoi, Vietnam, will enhance surveillance for pan‑respiratory diseases in Southeast Asia, including through expanded sample collection and access, and&nbsp;through capacity-building for laboratories and other healthcare facilities. This $5 million program will increase coverage of large urban population sites and significantly expand access to genomic testing equipment and technology.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Airborne Infection Defense Platform: USAID will support up to $10 million in programs to advance early detection and community response for COVID-19, tuberculosis, and other airborne diseases across Southeast Asia.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Global Health Worker Initiative:&nbsp;The United States is working to strengthen regional health systems, increase ASEAN countries’ health capacity, and expand, train, and protect the health workforce across Southeast Asia, in support of the newly-announced Administration Global Health Worker Initiative.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<ul><li>Supporting Community-Based Health Capacity: The President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) is strengthening human health systems management in ASEAN countries, including through train-the-trainer programs for clinical and community health workers and programs that counter discrimination in the health workforce toward HIV/AIDS patients.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Healthcare Curriculum: USAID is partnering with Vietnam to enhance its medical training program and ensure Vietnam’s health professionals are prepared to meet the country’s current and future needs.

<p class="has-text-align-center">Via Teleconference</p>



<p>9:40 A.M. EDT</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; And thanks, everyone, for joining.&nbsp; We’re going to do a quick call to preview some of the new initiatives we’re going to be announcing at the U.S.-ASEAN Special Summit.<br><br>This call is on background.&nbsp; It is attributable to a “senior administration official.”&nbsp; And the contents of this call are embargoed until 5:30 p.m. Eastern, U.S. time.<br><br>For your awareness and not for reporting, our speaker on the call today is [senior administration official].&nbsp; He’s going to give some remarks at the top, and then we’re going to take some questions.&nbsp; So, [senior administration official], over to you.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Thank you very, very much, [moderator].&nbsp; And thank you to all who are participating.<br><br>We are very excited here today at the White House, because we’re about to kick off the first day of the U.S.-ASEAN Special Summit.&nbsp; And as you all know, this is the first time it’s been held in Washington, D.C., and at the White House in the history of the 45-year-long partnership.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As I’m sure many of you are aware, at the end of last year, in October, at the U.S.-ASEAN virtual meeting that was held under Brunei’s chairmanship as part of the broader ASEAN Summit, and it also included the East Asia Summit, President Biden announced unprecedented investment of up to $102 million in U.S.-ASEAN relations.&nbsp; It significantly expanded our cooperation on health, climate, science and innovation, trade facilitation, education, and more.&nbsp; We are building on these efforts across the U.S. government at this summit and are very pleased that we’ve been able to work successfully with the different parts of our government as well as with our ASEAN partners.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You will get a lengthy factsheet after this call that highlights the things that we are &#8212; we will be announcing and the deliverables from this, but I think that the key is to put in a broader context that this reflects, I think, a recognition on the part of the administration and &#8212; that we need to step up our game in Southeast Asia and that we need to &#8212; as part of that, we need to work more closely with ASEAN.<br><br>I think that the &#8212; you know, some of the key initiatives that we will be announcing as part of this and that you will see in the factsheet include the following:</p>



<p>First, the United States will invest $40 million that we believe can potentially mobilize up to $2 billion in blended financing for clean energy infrastructure in Southeast Asia that will decarbonize and strengthen the region’s power system, increase regional energy trade, and accelerate the deployment of clean energy technologies, which we see as critical not just to helping address climate change in this fast-growing region, but also is critical to supporting broad-based economic growth in the countries in Southeast Asia that we believe is important for them and also important for us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And we also plan to announce $60 million in new regional maritime initiatives.&nbsp; And this reflects the great importance that maritime issues have in Southeast Asia and for Southeast Asian countries, as well as for the United States.<br><br>As &#8212; elements of this: The U.S. Coast Guard will deploy assets and assign additional personnel to the Indo-Pacific to help meet partners’ requests for maritime training and capacity-building, to include a U.S. Coast Guard attaché who will be assigned to the U.S. Mission to ASEAN.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Department of State, the Department of Labor, and the U.S. Coast Guard will launch new initiatives to help ASEAN counties counter illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing, and strengthen the capacity of ASEAN sectoral bodies to prevent forced labor in the fishing industry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The U.S. Coast Guard will deploy a cutter to Southeast Asia and Oceania for security cooperation and to operate as a training platform.&nbsp; We will also prioritize the transfer of ships &#8212; excess defense articles &#8212; to Southeast Asian countries to increase the coastal nations’ maritime law enforcement capacity and promote a free and open Indo-Pacific, which I’m sure you’ve all seen, or many of you will have seen, is also a key element in our Indo-Pacific strategy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And the Department of State and the U.S. Coast Guard will expand U.S. Coast Guard support to maritime law enforcement agencies in Southeast Asia by placing a training team in the region for the first time with additional dedicated support from U.S.-based trainers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to the clean energy and maritime issues, which we see as extremely important to the region and a very strong area of cooperation between the U.S. and ASEAN as an institution, as well as Southeast Asian nations in bilateral terms, we will also work to support efforts to accelerate digital development in the region, which would &#8212; builds on and benefit from the fact that the population of the United States and ASEAN nations together is a billion people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We will launch a new $6 million regional initiative that will support innovation, strengthen digital economy rulemaking, facilitate public-private connections, strengthen digital policymaking, and support the adoption of global standards in artificial intelligence.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And the U.S. Trade and Development Agency will launch new initiatives intended to catalyze up to, and perhaps even slightly over, $13 billion in financing for clean energy products &#8212; projects that advance ASEAN’s net zero goals while leveraging over $1 billion in public and private financing for investment in digital infrastructure and smart cities in Southeast Asia.</p>



<p>And then, you know, we also see health as a critical area of cooperation.&nbsp; And that was true before the pandemic, but it’s been even more reinforced as a result of our experiences during the pandemic.<br><br>As part of this, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, through its new regional office in Hanoi, Vietnam, will enhance surveillance for pan-respiratory diseases in Southeast Asia.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>This is a $5 million program will increase coverage of large urban population sites and significantly expand access to genomic testing equipment and technology.&nbsp; And then we will also announce that USAID will support up to $10 million in programs to advance early detection and community response for COVID-19, as well as tuberculosis and other airborne diseases across Southeast Asia.</p>



<p>In addition, we recognize that, you know, infrastructure and particularly transportation infrastructure remains a critical need in the region.&nbsp; And, as a result, the Department of Transportation will launch new air, land, and maritime transportation programs that a &#8212; or a series of new land, air, and maritime transportation programs that promote safety, sustainable and resilient infrastructure, regional connectivity, and emerging transport technologies.</p>



<p>In addition, we recognize the continued importance not just of climate issues but, as part of climate issues, environmental protection.&nbsp; And so, as a result, the Department of the Interior, including the National Park Service, will collaborate with their counterparts in Southeast Asia to expand conservation and reverse deforestation.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>And U.S. conversation personnel, including from U.S. &#8212; from the National Park Service will travel to Southeast Asia to share best practices and improve protected area management across the region, emphasizing nature-based climate solutions, as well as sustainable tourism and visitor management, traditional knowledge and access to resources, and transboundary habitat connectivity.</p>



<p>And then, something that we are particularly pleased to be able to announce is that &#8212; recognizing the tremendous importance of the strong people-to-people connections between the United States and countries in Southeast Asia &#8212; the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies &#8212; i.e. SAIS &#8212; will launch the U.S.-ASEAN Institute for Rising Leaders, an innovative program to bring exceptional public servants from ASEAN governments to the United States for professional and leadership training.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Through private funding, including from Boeing and UPS, the program will sponsor up to 30 mid-career public-service professionals each year &#8212; up to 3 from each of the 10 ASEAN countries &#8212; to attend a tailored, intensive multi-week leadership development program.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So as you can see, we have a range of new initiatives across key priority areas that we believe reflect both the traditional partnership between the United States and countries in Southeast Asia and ASEAN itself, as well as new areas that we see as really critical for building out the partnership between the United States and ASEAN, as well as, obviously, strengthening our continued engagements with individual countries in Southeast Asia.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>We’re excited to put this into action.&nbsp; Very excited about the summit, which we do believe marks a major milestone in the development and the strengthening of the U.S.-ASEAN partnership.<br><br>And, with that, I’ll talk a few questions.<br><br>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Could we please give out the directions to ask a question?<br><br></p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Morning, [senior administration official].&nbsp; You said that the U.S. needs to step up its game.&nbsp; Can you expand a little bit on why that’s the case and, you know, how what China has been doing in the region plays into this new push from the Biden administration?</p>



<p>And separately, many ASEAN countries are nervous about being caught between the U.S. and China, particularly publicly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So how did you convince them to agree to some of this new increased security cooperation that you mentioned?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; So, first, let me start off saying it&#8217;s a very good question.&nbsp; I think that I would challenge slightly the premise.&nbsp; We have long been engaged in Southeast Asia.&nbsp; I mean, very clearly, we&#8217;ve been an important player in the region going back to the period immediately after the end of the Second World War.&nbsp; We have longstanding alliances with the Philippines and Thailand.&nbsp; We have strong partnerships with a number of other key countries in the region.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>So this is &#8212; you know, Southeast Asia has been important to the United States for a long time.&nbsp; But there is no question that Southeast Asia’s importance is growing as Southeast Asia itself grows and becomes increasingly more prosperous and more important on the global stage.&nbsp; We have long sought strong relations with the region.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think that what has changed and where we need to step up our game is both working with countries bilaterally, but also working with ASEAN as an institution.&nbsp; As I&#8217;m sure you know, and I&#8217;m sure many others on the call, the &#8212; we’ve had a (inaudible) partnership with ASEAN for 45 years, the truth is it&#8217;s really been in the past, you know, 12, 13 years that we&#8217;ve really stepped up the engagement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I think it&#8217;s a recognition on our part that in order to be effective in Southeast Asia, we need to have a strong partnership and a strong relationship with ASEAN as an institution, as well as with countries bilaterally.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>So I think that, you know, in terms of China, obviously China is an important player in the region.&nbsp; We recognize and we’ve made very clear in our Indo-Pacific strategy, as well as things that we&#8217;ve said bilaterally and in our engagements, that we are not asking countries to make a choice between the United States and China.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We want to make clear, though, that the United States seeks stronger relationships, that we want to expand the areas of cooperation, and that we recognize that in order to do that, we need to be responsive to desires of countries in the region to work in areas that are important to them.&nbsp; So we are working to do that.&nbsp; I think that you&#8217;ve seen in the past year that &#8212; a real effort on the part of the administration to engage Southeast Asia.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, you know, this really started at the beginning of the administration, but COVID restrictions made travel difficult at the beginning.&nbsp; But we&#8217;ve had a steady cadence of senior-level visits &#8212; and going in both directions, in fact &#8212; now culminating with this.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I think that we, more importantly, want to continue building on the very close partnerships that we have with many countries in the region.&nbsp; We want to strengthen where we can.&nbsp; And we see that as part &#8212; we see this as part of that effort.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi.&nbsp; Thank you for taking the question.&nbsp; A number of the investments you&#8217;re announcing today seem to be on topics that are also included in the President&#8217;s Indo-Pacific Economic Framework.&nbsp; And I wondered if you might elaborate on the connection between the investments today in that framework, and whether these are sort of a precursor to some of the initiatives that the administration is looking to undertake as part of those negotiations?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; That&#8217;s a great question.&nbsp; And I think that the &#8212; I think it&#8217;s important to cite this in part of the broader context, which is that we recognize there is a tremendous desire in the region for affirmative U.S. economic engagement.&nbsp; We are very proud of the very strong economic links between the United States and Southeast Asian countries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We are either the leading or one of the most significant investors in many of these countries.&nbsp; There&#8217;s a great deal of trade that goes back and forth.&nbsp; And I think trade with the United States is particularly important in terms of higher value-added products for many of these countries.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the same time, we recognize that we cannot just rest on our laurels.&nbsp; We need to address concerns of &#8212; that matter to countries today and, obviously, advance our own economic interests in the process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, you know, you&#8217;re absolutely right there is some overlap with elements that will be addressed in the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework.&nbsp; But I think that the key is that the &#8212; these are things which reflect the strong shared interests between the United States and countries in the region.&nbsp; And the elements of these areas that will be in the economic framework, when it is formalized, I think reflect our recognition of the fact that to be effective, we need to address things that are of common concern.</p>



<p>In terms of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework itself &#8212; and I know that, you know, someone is going to ask, and I&#8217;ll just say: You know, we’re working with partners in the region on moving forward with the framework.&nbsp; I would stress it is an Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, not an “ASEAN economic framework,” and I think that&#8217;s a significant distinction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We are &#8212; at the same time, we&#8217;re working very closely with partners, including a number of countries in ASEAN, to move forward with this and to help get this off the ground.&nbsp; I think we will have more for you in the not-too-distant future.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the same time, I think that what we&#8217;re looking for in this summit is to really strengthen the areas of collaboration between the United States and ASEAN as an organization.&nbsp; And so, for us, these elements are a critical piece of that, but they are not the only piece of that.&nbsp; And there are many other issues that matter between the United States and ASEAN.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks so much for this.&nbsp; Two quick ones.&nbsp; The first would just be if you have a headline figure for all of the investments that you&#8217;re making here.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But also, just more substantively, I wanted to see if you had a status update on Build Back Better World and if that initiative is going to play into either these announcements or the discussions that you&#8217;re having at ASEAN.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Thank you very much.&nbsp; Both are very good questions.&nbsp; On the headline figure &#8212; and you &#8212; you know, it is rare that we make this kind of a mistake to overlook it &#8212; it is approximately $150 million.&nbsp; And so, we&#8217;re &#8212; you know, we’re very proud of that.&nbsp; We think it reflects the &#8212; you know, the strengthening of the relationship.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I think we want to be very clear we have quite a few bilateral programs &#8212; that are bilateral in nature &#8212; with countries in the region.&nbsp; So, you know, this is not the totality of our assistance to Southeast Asia, but this is what we&#8217;re looking to do with ASEAN as a result of this summit.</p>



<p>In terms of Build Back Better World &#8212; totally understand the question.&nbsp; You know, my sense is that, you know, there &#8212; that is operating on a different track.&nbsp; And there &#8212; you know, there&#8217;s continued efforts on that front.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think that for &#8212; where we stand, we see infrastructure as a very important element of what we&#8217;re doing with ASEAN.&nbsp; You&#8217;ve seen we&#8217;re looking for things that don&#8217;t just &#8212; that, you know, that are not just about providing assistance on specific projects or engagement on specific projects, but that are really seeking to catalyze greater private sector investment, because we believe that to really be effective, we need to harness some of the pools of private capital that are interested but are still sitting on the sidelines.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re looking for ways in which we can prime the pump to do that.</p>



<p>I think that there&#8217;s also a broader recognition of the importance of addressing infrastructure challenges and that this is something that matters to the region and where the United States can bring expertise.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re looking for the best way to harness that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks very much for doing this.&nbsp; Two questions.&nbsp; One specifically on announcements today.&nbsp; Can you expand on the infrastructure piece?&nbsp; I&#8217;m not sure I fully got &#8212; is there investment in infrastructure projects attached to that, or is it, you know, a sort of an advisory thing?&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, secondarily, just a big-picture question: Obviously, the gap between China and the U.S., in terms of overall trade with ASEAN, has gotten relatively wide over the last decade, and there&#8217;s not anything here about expanding market access, trade deals, et cetera.&nbsp; I know that&#8217;s not exactly on the table from the U.S.; it is from China.&nbsp; I guess, how would you respond to the idea that China has more to offer ASEAN economically at the moment than the U.S. does?&nbsp; Thanks.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; I totally understand the question.&nbsp; In term &#8212; let me just go to the first part, which is about the infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, as you may have heard at the top, I said we&#8217;re going to invest $40 million that will go into a blended financing program that we believe could mobilize up to $2 billion that will address clean energy infrastructure in the region.&nbsp; So, you know, that &#8212; so we&#8217;re doing that.</p>



<p>In addition, we have &#8212; we announced that the Department of Transportation will be launching some new programs that will promote safety as well as sustainable and resilient infrastructure and regional connectivity and emerging transport technologies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>And also, the U.S. Trade and Development Agency will announce some initiatives that will &#8212; that we believe could potentially catalyze over $13 billion in financing for clean-energy projects that advance net-zero goals.&nbsp; So, that&#8217;s the reference specifically to the infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In terms of the broader economic relationship, I think it&#8217;s very important to look at a number of things.&nbsp; One is, obviously, the bilateral &#8212; the trade data on goods trade &#8212; very clearly, the relationships with China have grown.&nbsp; I think that it needs to put in the context of, one, geographic proximity and also China&#8217;s growing economy.&nbsp; I mean, naturally, you know, the countries that are closest to China have a significant interest in expanding their trade ties.</p>



<p>I think that in terms of the quality, I would probably take a little bit of exception.&nbsp; I think that the U.S. plays an extremely important role in virtually all of the economies of the countries that will be here.&nbsp; And that role isn&#8217;t just measured in bilateral trade and goods; it&#8217;s measured in services; it&#8217;s also measured in investment.&nbsp; And I think that you can see that in virtually all of these countries, the U.S. remains the largest source of foreign direct investment.&nbsp; And the U.S. foreign direct investment has produced &#8212; it has produced high-quality areas where they&#8217;re able &#8212; the countries in the region are able to participate in much higher value chains.</p>



<p>I think that one of the things that was really driven home by the pandemic and the disruptions on supply chains is that we are extremely &#8212; we&#8217;re extremely closely linked with economies in Southeast Asia.&nbsp; I would just highlight the fact that when chip factories in Malaysia closed, that caused ripple effects that had a real impact on the U.S. auto industry.&nbsp; And I think what that does is it highlights the fact that a lot of the trade between Southeast Asian countries and the United States has a much higher value add for the countries involved.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So we believe that the economic partnership with the United States is still very important.&nbsp; And I think if you look at the relative openness of the markets, the U.S. still does extremely well in comparison to other major trading partners, in terms of the overall openness of our market.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the same time, we recognize that we can&#8217;t simply rest on our laurels.&nbsp; We need to come up with an affirmative economic agenda that makes clear our understanding and our desire to work with countries to address today’s challenges &#8212; some of them, as you know, which are not necessarily covered by traditional trade agreements.&nbsp; And, in that, I would particularly highlight the fact that we&#8217;ve all become far more aware of the importance of supply chains and, in particular, redundancy and resiliency in supply chains.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, I think that there are significant areas where we have the potential to work closely and strengthen the partnerships with Southeast Asian countries.&nbsp; I think Southeast Asian countries are very aware of the economic benefits of closer ties to the United States.&nbsp; And we believe that there is also significant benefits to Americans as well.</p>



<p>One thing that we plan on doing &#8212; and I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve seen &#8212; there will be a CEO event that will be hosted by Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo that the ASEAN leaders will participate in.&nbsp; And I think that that is an indication of the importance that they place on their economic ties with the United States, as well as the fact that we recognize their tremendous benefits to Americans and American firms through stronger connections to an area that is growing significantly and will be increasingly important in global terms in the coming two decades.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you so much.&nbsp; I just want to pick up a couple of questions from my colleagues.&nbsp; And I apologize if this has been discussed earlier; I had some audio problems in the beginning.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just more on the Indones- &#8212; Indo-Pacific Economic Framework.&nbsp; On the logistics of it, is it something that&#8217;s going to be formally announced later on during the President&#8217;s trip to Asia, or is it going to be formally announced during the summit?&nbsp; And can you explain whether some ASEAN countries are interested to sign on; which particular modules are they most interested in?</p>



<p>And just also a follow-up on Build Back Better World.&nbsp; I understand the Daleep Singh has made these listening tours to Africa and the Middle East and Latin America, but I don&#8217;t believe that he&#8217;s been to Southeast Asia on these tours.&nbsp; So, can you explain why and whether there are any plans to do that, and whether there are actually any interest from ASEAN countries for the BW3 program?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Okay, you&#8217;ve asked a bunch of questions, so let me just try and go through those.</p>



<p>I think that in terms of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, again, I don&#8217;t want to get ahead of ourselves.&nbsp; We are working to be able to roll this out at an appropriate time and I don&#8217;t want to point to when that will be.&nbsp; We’re still working on that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, I think that in terms of the interest, we are &#8212; we&#8217;ve been pleasantly surprised at the level of interest from countries in Southeast Asia as well as from other parts of the Indo-Pacific.&nbsp; We believe that this bodes well.&nbsp; At the same time, we don&#8217;t want to get ahead of ourselves, and we still have some work to do as we move forward.</p>



<p>I think that we recognize, though, as I said before, the tremendous importance of an affirmative U.S. economic engagement with the region and that this is something that very much reflects what the region wants.</p>



<p>I think in terms of specific modules &#8212; again, I don&#8217;t want to get ahead of ourselves on that &#8212; I think that we &#8212; as I said, we&#8217;ve been pleasantly surprised by the level of interest from across the region, including from countries in Southeast Asia.&nbsp; And, you know, we&#8217;re looking forward to continuing to work closely with them as we move forward.</p>



<p>In terms of Daleep &#8212; Deputy National Security Advisor Daleep Singh&#8217;s travel, I think that you raise a good point.&nbsp; I would just stress that we have had extensive senior-level engagement with Southeast Asian countries.&nbsp; We have heard very clearly a very strong desire for the U.S. to be more economically engaged.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s obviously part of what&#8217;s gone into the desire to move forward with the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve also heard a great deal of interest in greater U.S. participation in infrastructure efforts.&nbsp; So, you know, while Daleep hasn&#8217;t gone into the region specifically for the purpose of a listening tour, I would note that the Vice President was in the region, the Secretary of Defense has gone to the region, the Secretary of Commerce has gone to the region, the Secretary of State has gone to the region.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve had visitors here, including the Prime Minister of Singapore, who I&#8217;m sure you saw was here at the end of March.&nbsp; The President has engaged with &#8212; virtually with the ASEAN leaders at the ASEAN Summit in October.&nbsp; So we have heard very loudly and clearly the interests from the countries involved.</p>



<p>So, I think that, you know, from our standpoint, we&#8217;re moving forward with this.&nbsp; This is obviously not an easy thing to do, and it&#8217;s very important to coordinate effectively.&nbsp; We want to make sure that we&#8217;re working as partners rather than, you know, dictating sort of a U.S.-only vision for how things should be.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We also are very, very focused on the need to address today&#8217;s challenges and tomorrow&#8217;s, and to look for things &#8212; and look for ways in which we can address the kinds of things that haven&#8217;t always been addressed in traditional trade agreements.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We remain very, very committed to strengthening the U.S. partnership economically, as well as politically and in security terms with the region.&nbsp; We believe that, you know, this is a big part of doing that and there is nothing that substitutes for direct engagement at the leader level.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, we&#8217;re very proud that we&#8217;re able to do this and look forward to a successful summit.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re deeply grateful to our ASEAN partners for the spirit of cooperation that they approach &#8212; they&#8217;ve approached this with.&nbsp; And they&#8217;re &#8212; you know, what we see is their very, very sincere desire for stronger ties with the United States, both with ASEAN as an institution, as well as bilaterally.</p>



<p>So, with that, let me thank you all for joining, and we hope that &#8212; we hope that, you know, we’ll stand ready to answer more questions at some point down the road.&nbsp; You can contact [moderator].&nbsp; But I think we&#8217;re looking forward to a very successful summit.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; Thanks, [senior administration official].</p>



<p>And as a reminder, this call was on background, attributable to a “senior administration official,” and the contents are embargoed until 5:30 p.m. Eastern today.</p>



<p>I know some of you asked for the factsheet; that&#8217;s going to be in your inbox shortly.&nbsp; So thanks, everyone, for joining and talk to you later.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Via Teleconference</p>



<p>3:02 P.M. EDT</p>



<p>MR. MUNOZ:&nbsp; Hi, everybody.&nbsp; Thank you for joining us this afternoon for a call discussing new additional actions President Biden is taking to expand availability of infant formula supply in the United States, especially following his meeting with manufacturers and industry this afternoon.</p>



<p>A reminder this call and the factsheet that you just received are embargoed until the conclusion of the call.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On today&#8217;s call, we have [senior administration official] and [senior administration official].</p>



<p>As a reminder, this call is attributable to senior administration officials.&nbsp; And we’ll have time for questions at the end.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With that, I will kick it to [senior administration official].</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; Thanks, Kevin.&nbsp; And thank you all for joining us today to discuss actions that the President has announced to address the infant formula shortages in the country.</p>



<p>As you are all no doubt aware, on February 17th, the largest infant formula manufacturer in the country, Abbott Nutrition, initiated a voluntary recall of several of their lines of formula.&nbsp; The impacted formula was immediately pulled from the shelves and taken out of warehouse inventory across the country, and production at Abbott&#8217;s manufacturing facility in Sturgis, Michigan, was halted.</p>



<p>This voluntary action came following concerns about bacterial contamination at the facility after four infants became ill and two died in late 2021 and early 2022.</p>



<p>Over the last several months, the federal government has worked to address the production shortfall brought about by the recall.&nbsp; As a result of our ongoing work, more infant formula has been produced in the last four weeks than in the four weeks that preceded the recall, despite the fact that one of the largest infant formula production facilities in the country has been offline during that period.</p>



<p>But we also know that families across the country remain concerned about the availability of infant formula, especially families that rely on specialty products that are harder to substitute and some of which are only produced at the Michigan facility.</p>



<p>So, today, President Biden spoke with retailers and manufacturers, including the CEOs of Walmart, Target, Mead Johnson, and Gerber to talk to them about the work they are doing and call on them to do all they can to help families purchase and access infant formula.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The President discussed with Mead Johnson and Gerber their ongoing efforts to increase production.&nbsp; Their work has made up for the loss of production by Abbott.&nbsp; And the President talked to them about other ways the administration can help on top of the actions that are being announced today.</p>



<p>When the President was speaking to the CEOs of Walmart and Target, he focused on issues specific to retailers and how they are working to stock shelves, including in rural areas and regional disparities they might be seeing.</p>



<p>The President similarly asked what more his team and all of us can do to help move product and get more product to these communities.</p>



<p>Building on that work, the President today also announced several additional steps to get more infant formula onto store shelves as quickly as possible without compromising safety.</p>



<p>Both steps include, first, cutting red tape to get more infant formula to the shelves by urging states to provide flexibility in the WIC program, which can be a key driver of some supply disruptions; second, calling on FTC and state attorneys general to crack down on price gouging and unfair market practices related to the sales of infant formula, like third-party sellers reselling infant formula at steep markups; and third, increasing the supply of infant formula through increased imports.</p>



<p>These are important actions that build on the work the administration has done to date.&nbsp; And we will continue to find other ways to support the safe and rapid increase in production and distribution of infant formula.</p>



<p>So, with that, [senior administration official] and I would be happy to take your questions.</p>



<p>MR. MUNOZ:&nbsp; Thanks, [senior administration official].&nbsp; First question &#8212; we have time for just a couple &#8212; Kaitlan Collins, CNN.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks so much.&nbsp; I&#8217;m wondering what the retailers and manufacturers told the President today about how long they expect this to last.&nbsp; And when do you think &#8212; what is your assessment of when they will restart production at this facility?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Yeah, so I&#8217;m not able to share any additional details about the specific conversations.&nbsp; I will reiterate that they were productive and encouraging conversations about all the work that we can do together to support moms and families during this time.&nbsp; And we do not today have an estimate for when Abbott’s facility will come online.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But as we have said, this administration is working around the clock to do everything we can to bring as much production to market while protecting the safety and wellbeing of families.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; In addition, the manufacturers reassured us that they were going to do all that was necessary to maintain increased production levels at all their facilities to make sure that they are able to meet the needs of the market at this time.</p>



<p>MR. MUNOZ:&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; Let’s go to Jeff Mason at Reuters.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks very much.&nbsp; Can you give us more details on what you mean by increasing imports?&nbsp; The factsheet indicated that there will be an announcement about that in the coming days, if you&#8217;re able to give any more details on that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And do you have a sense of &#8212; the one piece of the factsheet that I found hard to understand was the WIC program that you also referred to.&nbsp; What impact will those changes have?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; I can take those in turn.</p>



<p>On the FDA action, I don&#8217;t have too much more to share.&nbsp; FDA is working now to make an announcement very soon about how we will be able to import more formula from abroad to lessen challenges for families, and we will certainly be in touch as we have additional details to announce there.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the WIC program, let me start, and then [senior administration official] can talk a little bit about how this affects the supply chain as a whole.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But as you all likely know, the WIC program supports the purchase of formula and other nutrition products for families of young children and moms.</p>



<p>There are, in normal times, significant rules about what products families can purchase.&nbsp; And there are also rules about how suppliers that participate in the WIC program have to maintain stock of particular supplies in order to participate in WIC.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so, USDA has been working since February with states to relax those rules and make it easier for families to substitute products and for suppliers and retailers to more flexibly participate in the WIC program.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And USDA will be urging all states to take up that &#8212; to take up those flexibilities and really alleviate burdens across the supply chain that can, again, make it difficult for families and retailers.</p>



<p>[Senior administration official], anything you want to add there?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; On the production side, what that effectively does is: When you decrease the variability and the complexity of products that a manufacturer has to make, they can institute a lot more scale efficiencies in their production process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So if you have states go from saying “We&#8217;ll only let you buy 12 ounces” for your WIC participants, and instead saying “You can buy 32-ounce containers,” then they can run more efficient production lines and only have to produce a lot of 32-ounce containers instead of 12-ounce containers.&nbsp; That just leads to faster production out of plants, quicker delivery of product from factory floor to store shelves.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And it&#8217;s important here that the states take actions that drive kind of standardization in the market like that to decrease the manufacturing complexities.</p>



<p>MR. MUNOZ:&nbsp; Let’s go to Hannah Brandt at Nexstar.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; Thanks for taking my question.&nbsp; There are a lot of lawmakers on both sides calling for the President to invoke the Defense Production Act.&nbsp; Is there any talk about that?&nbsp; Is that a future action he might take if this continues?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; So, I can take that one.&nbsp; You know, as we said at the top, we remain 100 percent focused on this issue.&nbsp; We know it’s urgent.&nbsp; We know it’s important to families and to vulnerable children.&nbsp; So we&#8217;ll continue to explore every option at the &#8212; on the table and look at any lever we can pull to address the situation.</p>



<p>We know that the recall has impacted availability of formula.&nbsp; And as you&#8217;ve heard us talk about today, we have taken measures &#8212; the FDA has taken measures, USDA has taken measures, and the companies have all taken measures here to ramp up production quickly.&nbsp; We feel &#8212; we are reassured that the companies now are back at production levels that are above the production levels that they had been right before the February 17th recall took place.&nbsp; But, again, we&#8217;re going to keep every option on the table and keep exploring things we can do.</p>



<p>MR. MUNOZ:&nbsp; All right, and we have time for a couple more questions.&nbsp; Let’s go to Kevin Robillard at Huffington Post.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, guys.&nbsp; Thanks for taking the questions.&nbsp; Thanks for doing the call.&nbsp; Why did it take so long for this issue to sort of come up the White House&#8217;s radar?&nbsp; This has obviously been building for quite some time, and it really has been, you know, pretty acute since the recall happened.&nbsp; So why wasn&#8217;t &#8212; why weren&#8217;t steps being taken, sort of, more proactively over the past few months to alleviate this problem?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Yeah, so I can assure you that this is not new to the White House&#8217;s radar.&nbsp; We have been working on this issue since the very beginning, in the days leading up to the recall and ever since then.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, you know, since mid-February, we have been working closely with USDA and FDA on a suite of actions that they have taken, which is why we are able to say today that production today is &#8212; you know, exceeds production in the period just before the recall was &#8212; the recall was initiated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As just some examples of the ongoing work we have been doing: We’ve, throughout this period, been cutting red tape to expedite the import of infant formula for other countries.&nbsp; Since February, we have been working with retailers to impose purchase limits, prevent the possibility of hoarding.&nbsp; Again, we have had ongoing work with other &#8212; with all manufacturers of infant formula to bring product to market, and we have really seen that pay off.&nbsp; And, you know, it is helping to mitigate some of the challenges that we might otherwise be facing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the same time, we absolutely recognize the frustration that American families are feeling right now.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s why the President has acted to direct the administration to pull additional levers and take additional action to make more supply available as quickly as possible.&nbsp; He&#8217;s leading with action, not words.&nbsp; And that’s the package of announcements you&#8217;re seeing today.</p>



<p>MR. MUNOZ:&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; Last question.&nbsp; Let’s go to Kathryn Watson at CBS.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi.&nbsp; Thank you so much for doing this call.&nbsp; If production has reached the levels &#8212; reached or surpassed the levels of where it was before this recall, when can parents expect to see that result on the shelves?&nbsp; How many weeks, days, months are we talking about until the &#8212; you know, that supply is actually felt?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; So, we absolutely recognize the frustration of parents and families.&nbsp; I am expecting my second child in June and, you know, feel this issue very, very acutely.&nbsp; So, you know, this is &#8212; we know that the American people need to see product on the shelves consistently and that this is a critical issue.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why we are announcing this package of actions today to speed things up.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t have a particular timeline for you. &nbsp;But we are &#8212; we are working closely with partners across the federal government to mitigate these shortages and improve experiences for American families as they’re shopping for formula across the country.</p>



<p>MR. MUNOZ:&nbsp; Thanks, [senior administration official], and thanks, [senior administration official].&nbsp; Again, thank you everybody for joining this call.&nbsp; When we get off this, both the contents of the call and the factsheet are lifted.&nbsp; And reach out to me with any questions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thank you.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>3:17 P.M. EDT</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>President Biden has directed his administration to work urgently to ensure that during the Abbott Nutrition voluntary recall, infant formula is safe and available for families across the country. Today, President Biden spoke with retailers and manufacturers, including Wal-Mart, Target, Reckitt, and Gerber, to discuss ways we can all work together to do more to help families access infant formula.</p>



<p>On February 17, the largest infant formula manufacturer in the country—Abbott Nutrition—initiated a voluntary recall of several lines of powdered formula. This came after concerns about bacterial contamination at Abbott’s Sturgis, Michigan, facility after four infants fell ill and two died. The federal government—including the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Department of Agriculture (USDA), Department of Justice (DOJ), Department of Transportation (DOT), U.S. Trade Representative (USTR), Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Department of Commerce (DOC), and the White House—has worked diligently over the last few months to address the shortfall in infant formula production while the Sturgis plant remains offline, including working with other infant formula manufacturers to increase production, expediting the import of infant formula from abroad, and calling on both online and in store retailers to establish purchasing limits to prevent the possibility of hoarding. As a result, more infant formula has been produced in the last four weeks than in the four weeks preceding the recall &#8212; despite one of the largest infant formula production facilities in the U.S. being offline.</p>



<p>Families across the country remain concerned about the availability of infant formula—especially families that depend on specialty formulas for which the Sturgis facility is a key supplier. These 20 specialty formulas are used by about 5,000 infants as well as some older children and adults with rare metabolic diseases, and Abbott Nutrition is the only supplier for some of these formulas.</p>



<p>Today, President Biden is announcing additional steps to bolster our work to get infant formula onto store shelves as quickly as possible without compromising safety. These steps include:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Cutting Red Tape to Get More Infant Formula to Store Shelves Quicker: </strong>Manufacturers typically produce many different sizes of the same type of infant formula. Simplifying product offerings allows manufacturers to increase the speed and scale of their infant formula production, stabilizing the overall volume of formula available in the market. The type of formula that companies make and distribute is impacted by the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), administered by USDA. About half of infant formula nationwide is purchased by participants using WIC benefits, based on both federal requirements and additional rules set by individual states that have a large effect on the availability and distribution of infant formula in a given state.</li></ul>



<p>To help further increase manufacturers’ ability to meet demand and distribute formula, USDA is working with states to make it easier for vulnerable families to purchase the formula they need with their WIC benefits. USDA is urging states to allow WIC recipients to use their WIC benefits on a wider variety of products so that if certain sizes or types of formula are out of stock, they can use their benefits on those that are in stock. And, USDA is urging states to relax their requirements that stores keep a certain amount of formula in stock. This will offer relief to retailers and allow companies to manage inventories to meet demand. Some states are already doing this. All fifty states should. These actions will make it easier for vulnerable families to get the necessary nutritional support for their infants.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Calling on the FTC and State Attorneys General to Crack Down on Any Price Gouging or Unfair Market Practices Related to Sales of Infant Formula: </strong>Parents looking to feed their child should not be taken advantage of by unscrupulous retailers unfairly jacking up prices. There have been <a href="https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/baby-formula-shortage-forces-mothers-to-go-to-the-extreme/2771731/?amp">several</a> <a href="https://www.wtvr.com/news/local-news/baby-formula-shortage-virginia-moms">reports</a> that actors are purchasing formula at retail stores and reselling it online at a markup several times the retail price, especially specialty brands of formula that have experienced the most disruption. These actions not only are costing families hundreds of dollars for formula they need, but drive scarcity on the market. Since February, the FDA has worked with companies, calling on them to issue purchasing limits to help limit such predatory behavior. Many responsible retailers have responded to that call. Now, DOJ is engaging with state attorneys general to encourage them to use their powers to monitor and address price gouging in the infant formula market, and urging them to devote more resources to monitoring predatory behavior in the market for infant formula. And, the President today asked the Federal Trade Commission to use all its available tools to monitor and investigate reports of illegal and predatory conduct.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Increasing the Supply of Formula Through Increased Imports: </strong>The U.S. normally produces 98% percent of the infant formula it consumes, and trading partners in Mexico, Chile, Ireland, and the Netherlands are key sources of imports. But given the production and distribution issues leading to local short supplies of infant formula, the FDA will, in the coming days, announce specific new steps it is taking concerning importing certain infant formula products from abroad.</li></ul>



<p>More information on actions that the FDA announced earlier this week to address the shortage of infant formula can be found <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-takes-important-steps-improve-supply-infant-and-specialty-formula-products">here</a>. The Biden-Harris Administration will continue to monitor the situation and identify other ways it can support the safe and rapid increase in the production and distribution of baby formula.</p>
