<p class="has-text-align-center"><br><em>This Equal Pay Day, the White House is announcing critical steps that the Biden-Harris Administration is taking to advance pay equity and promote women’s economic security.</em></p>



<p>President Biden and Vice President Harris have long championed&nbsp;equal pay as a cornerstone of their commitment to&nbsp;ensuring all people have a fair and equal opportunity to get ahead.&nbsp;Closing gender and racial wage gaps is essential to building an equitable economy and&nbsp;addressing&nbsp;the barriers that have long hampered women from fully participating in the labor force.&nbsp;But we still have work to do.&nbsp;In 2020,&nbsp;the average woman working full-time, year-round earned 83 cents for every dollar paid to their average male counterpart. &nbsp;Compared with the average man working full-time, year-round, disparities&nbsp;are&nbsp;even&nbsp;greater for Black&nbsp;women, Native American&nbsp;women, and&nbsp;Latinas, as well as certain subpopulations of Asian women.</p>



<p>This Equal Pay Day,&nbsp;the Vice President&nbsp;is&nbsp;hosting&nbsp;a&nbsp;virtual summit,&nbsp;bringing together&nbsp;partners across&nbsp;the country who are taking critical steps to&nbsp;tackle pay discrimination,&nbsp;create&nbsp;good-paying jobs, and&nbsp;support families’ access to care.</p>



<p>Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing new actions to promote women’s employment and support working families across the country. These actions will:</p>



<p>• <strong>Advance pay equity for the Federal workforce.</strong>  The Office of Personnel Management announced that they anticipate issuing a proposed regulation that will address the use of prior salary history in the hiring and pay-setting process for Federal employees, consistent with the President’s Executive Order on Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility in the Federal Workforce.  Banning the use of prior salary history can help break the cycle of past arbitrary and potentially discriminatory pay that can follow women and workers of color from job to job, entrenching gender and racial pay gaps over time.</p>



<p> • <strong>Promote efforts to achieve pay equity for job applicants and employees of Federal contractors.</strong> President Biden will sign an Executive Order directing the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council to consider enhancing pay equity and transparency, including by limiting or prohibiting federal contractors from seeking and considering information about job applicants&#8217; and employees&#8217; existing or past compensation when making employment decisions, and appropriate accountability measures.  The Department of Labor will consult with the FAR Council on the efficiency, economy, and effectiveness in Federal contracting that would be promoted by potential regulatory changes, and the most effective implementation strategy for any subsequent rulemaking.</p>



<p>• <strong>Strengthen pay equity audits by Federal contractors.</strong> The Department of Labor’s Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs issued a new <a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ofccp/directives/2022-01">directive</a> clarifying federal contractors’ annual obligation to analyze their compensation practices.  Conducting these pay equity audits helps address and prevent pay disparities based on gender, race, or ethnicity.</p>



<p>• <strong>Ensure equitable access to good-paying jobs. </strong>The Department of Labor issued a <a href="https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/WB/media/BearingTheCostReport.pdf">report</a> analyzing the impact that women’s concentration in low-wage sectors – and their relative underrepresentation in many good-paying occupations – has on their overall economic security and gender and racial wage gaps. The report finds that, in 2019, Black women lost $39.3 billion and Hispanic women lost $46.7 billion in wages compared to white men due to differences in industry and occupation. This segregation intensified the COVID-19 pandemic’s disproportionate impact on women, in part due to the overrepresentation of women in hard-hit industries such as hospitality.  </p>



<p>• <strong>Address discrimination against caregivers.  </strong>Yesterday, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/covid-19-pandemic-and-caregiver-discrimination-under-federal-employment">published technical assistance</a> on caregiver discrimination, addressing the circumstances under which discrimination against applicants and employees based on pandemic-related caregiving responsibilities may violate federal employment discrimination laws.</p>



<p>The actions announced today build on steps the Administration has taken to advance pay equity, including:</p>



<p>• <strong>Provided immediate relief through the American Rescue Plan (ARP) to millions of women who have borne the brunt of the pandemic. </strong> This work includes: standing up a historic vaccination program that has fully vaccinated more than 215 million Americans; reopening schools; providing direct payments to individuals; expanding nutrition programs for families; providing paid leave tax credits for small and midsize employers; distributing the majority of emergency rental assistance to female-headed households; and expanding the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/09/15/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-whole-of-government-effort-to-ensure-child-tax-credit-reaches-all-eligible-families/">Child Tax Credit</a>, which last year helped reduce child poverty to its estimated lowest level in recorded American history.</p>



<p>• <strong>Helped keep child care providers open and boosted pay for child care workers.</strong> States have already delivered American Rescue Plan stabilization grants to more than 150,000 child care providers serving more than 5 million children and their families. One <a href="https://www.naeyc.org/sites/default/files/wysiwyg/user-98/naeyc_ece_field_survey_february2022.pdf">survey</a> finds that 92% of providers receiving funds relied on them to help stay open and nearly half used them to repay debt incurred during the pandemic. Many states also used funds to help boost compensation of the child care workforce. For example, Minnesota is requiring providers to increase compensation, while North Carolina and Connecticut offered bonus payments to providers who increased compensation of the workforce. Increasing compensation for child care workershelps narrow gender and racial pay gaps, as more than nine in ten are women and more than four in ten are women of color. While ARP funds allowed child care programs to provide temporary bonuses, they need long-term funding asthe President has proposed to sustainably increase wages.</p>



<p>• <strong>Provided tax relief to help families with child care costs during the pandemic by delivering a historic increase in the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit (CDCTC) to support millions of working families this tax season.</strong> The ARP increased the maximum CDCTC for a median income family with two children under age 13 by more than sixtimes—providing up to $8,000 towards child care expenses in 2021. It will reimburse most families for up to half of their child care expenses. And the ARP CDCTC is fully-refundable, helping lower-income parents fully benefit regardless of their tax liability. Even before the pandemic, families struggled to afford child care, forcing parents and especially mothers to forego higher paying jobs, work fewer hours, or take time out of the workforce, leading to lower pay over their career. The President has urged Congress to pass his plan for child care, which could lower child care costs for nine in ten families with young children.</p>



<p>• <strong>Increased the minimum wage to $15 per hour for Federal workers and contractors, benefiting manywomen and people of color. </strong>The President issued <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/27/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-issues-an-executive-order-to-raise-the-minimum-wage-to-15-for-federal-contractors/">Executive Orders</a> directing the Administration to work toward ensuring that employees working on federal contracts and federal employees earned a $15 per hour minimum wage. Those directives went into effect in January, raising the wages of about 370,000 federal employees and employees of federal contractors. In addition to helping the government do its work more efficiently, these directives take a step towards narrowing racial and gender disparities in income, as many low-wage workers are women and people of color. The order also eliminates the subminimum wage for workers with disabilities. The President has called on Congress to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour, so that American workers can have a job that delivers dignity, and to make greater strides towards pay equity.</p>



<p>• <strong>Signed into law the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.  </strong>Administration investments through this law will increase access to good-paying jobs, including for women, people of color, and members of other communities who are currently underrepresented in the sectors where these jobs will be created, such as transportation, clean energy, and broadband.<strong>  </strong>The Department of Transportation and the Department of Labor signed a <a href="https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/OPA/newsreleases/2022/03/OSEC20220210.pdf">memorandum of understanding</a> to promote the creation of good infrastructure and transportation jobs with a focus on equitable workforce development using funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.</p>



<p>• <strong>Issued an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/06/25/executive-order-on-diversity-equity-inclusion-and-accessibility-in-the-federal-workforce/">Executive Order</a> to promote diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility across the federal government – the nation’s largest employer</strong> – including by prioritizing efforts to close gender and racial wage gaps, address workplace safety and harassment, including in our national security workforce, and advance equity for LGBTQI+ public servants.</p>



<p>• <strong>Issued an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/09/fact-sheet-executive-order-on-promoting-competition-in-the-american-economy/">Executive Order</a> on Promoting Competition in the American Economy. </strong>This established the Administration’s policy of addressing <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/State-of-Labor-Market-Competition-2022.pdf">anticompetitive behavior</a> in labor markets, which can fall heavily on women and workers of color. The Order includes specific initiatives to promote competition in labor markets, including encouraging the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to ban or limit non-compete agreements, and encouraging the FTC and the Department of Justice to strengthen antitrust guidance to prevent employers from collaborating to suppress wages or reduce benefits by sharing wage and benefit information with one another.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Freight Logistics Optimization Works (FLOW) Will Speed Up Delivery Times and Reduce Consumer Costs</em><br><br><em>White House to Host Launch Event Today with Key Industry Stakeholders</em></p>



<p>Since taking office, the Biden-Harris Administration has been focused on addressing supply chain vulnerabilities and congestion, working to speed up the movement of goods, and lower costs for families. Last year, the ports and the private sector moved a historic amount of goods with record holiday sales and delivery times below pre-pandemic levels. Currently, real retail inventories excluding autos are six percent higher than at the end of 2019 and products at grocery and drug stores are 90 percent in stock, just 1 percentage point below pre-pandemic levels.</p>



<p>The Administration is also focused on addressing the longer-term weaknesses in our nation’s supply chains, the result of decades of underinvestment, outsourcing, and offshoring instead of investment in long-term security, sustainability, and resilience. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) is now making a generational investment in our ports, highways, and other parts of our physical infrastructure, which will help speed up the movement of goods and lower costs. But we can further strengthen our goods movement supply chains by making a similarly bold improvement in a <em>digital</em> infrastructure to connect the supply chain.</p>



<p><strong>To take the first step toward addressing this challenge, the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing the launch of Freight Logistics Optimization Works (FLOW), an information sharing initiative to pilot key freight information exchange between parts of the goods movement supply chain. </strong>FLOW includes eighteen initial participants that represent diverse perspectives across the supply chain, including private businesses, trucking, warehousing, and logistics companies, ports, and more. &nbsp;These key stakeholders will work together with the Administration to develop a proof-of-concept information exchange to ease supply chain congestion, speed up the movement of goods, and ultimately cut costs for American consumers. DOT will lead this effort, playing the role of an honest broker and convener to bring supply chain stakeholders together to problem solve and overcome coordination challenges. This initial phase aims to produce a proof-of-concept freight information exchange by the end of the summer.<br><strong><br>A Novel Data Sharing Partnership<br></strong><br>Recent supply chain disruptions have raised national awareness of the need for improved information exchange. Supply chain stakeholders deserve reliable, predictable, and accurate information about goods movement and FLOW will test the idea that cooperation on foundational freight digital infrastructure is in the interest of both public and private parties. FLOW is designed to support businesses throughout the supply chain and improve accuracy of information from end-to-end for a more resilient supply chain.</p>



<p>Resiliency—the ability to recover from an unexpected shock—requires visibility, agility, and redundancy. The lack of digital infrastructure and transparency makes our supply chains brittle and unable to adapt when faced with a shock. The goods movement chain is almost entirely privately operated and spans shipping lines, ports, terminal operators, truckers, railroads, warehouses, and cargo owners such as retailers. These different actors have made great strides in digitizing their own internal operations, but they do not always exchange information with each other. This lack of information exchange can cause delays as cargo moves from one part of the supply chain to another, driving up costs and increasing goods movement fragility.</p>



<p>This effort shows a strong and deliberate response by the Administration to tackle this challenge head-on and set the country on the right trajectory for a resilient and globally competitive 21st century goods movement chain. The Biden-Harris Administration is laser focused and creative in identifying ways to speed up the movement of goods from ships to shelves and cut costs for American consumers. With FLOW, the Biden Administration will play a leadership role in bringing companies together to problem solve for the American people. Initial partners in FLOW include:</p>



<p><strong>Port Authorities:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Port of Long Beach</li><li>Port of Los Angeles</li><li>Georgia Ports Authority</li></ul>



<p><strong>Ocean Carriers:</strong></p>



<ul><li>CMA CGM</li><li>MSC</li></ul>



<p><strong>Terminal Operators:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Fenix Marine Terminal</li><li>Global Container Terminals</li></ul>



<p><strong>Business:&nbsp;</strong></p>



<ul><li>Albertsons</li><li>Gemini Shippers</li><li>Land O’ Lakes</li><li>Target</li><li>True Value</li></ul>



<p><strong>Trucking</strong></p>



<ul><li>&nbsp;CH Robinson</li></ul>



<p><strong>Chassis:</strong></p>



<ul><li>DCLI</li><li>FlexiVan</li></ul>



<p><strong>Logistics and Warehousing:</strong></p>



<ul><li>FedEx</li><li>Prologis</li><li>UPS</li></ul>



<p>These first partners are committed to working with the Biden-Harris Administration to identify and operationalize a first information exchange that will support a more resilient and fluid supply chain. They represent stakeholders throughout the supply chain including large BCOs (beneficial cargo owners) like Target, small and medium size businesses represented by True Value and Gemini Shippers, as well as agricultural producers such as Land O’Lakes. FLOW will be able to address issues such as ensuring early return dates are consistent across partners, measuring more accurate chassis availability and understanding aggregate dwell time throughout the supply chain. The principles of the pilot include the following: it is a voluntary, secure national exchange for freight information, it is available to participants who share data, and it is sustained by supply chain operational improvement.<br><br><strong><u>For additional interested parties, the Biden-Harris Administration is launching a webpage to gauge additional stakeholder interest in supporting foundational freight infrastructure:<br></u></strong><br>While starting with a limited pilot, DOT wants to hear from others who are interested in engaging as part of FLOW as a participant as the initiative grows. Within one month of the FLOW launch, DOT will launch a web page to gauge industry interest in participation and data sharing for a potential long-term FLOW effort.</p>



<p><strong>Building on Ongoing Supply Chain Achievements<br></strong><br>The FLOW initiative builds on previous successes of the Biden-Harris Supply Chain Disruptions Task Force to ensure cargo is getting from ship to shelf, including:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Reduced Dwell Time in Los Angeles and Long Beach.</strong> At the beginning of November, with support from the Administration, the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach proposed charging the ocean carriers for cargo that dwelled on the docks for nine days or more, which led to about a 60 percent reduction in the number of long-dwelling import containers on the docks to date.<br></li><li><strong>Alleviated congestion at the Port of Savannah</strong> by funding the Georgia Port Authority pop-up container yards project. With this policy change, the Georgia Port Authority was able to reallocate more than $8 million to convert existing inland facilities into five pop-up container yards in both Georgia and North Carolina.  Since the temporary container yards opened in late November, the container yards have provided relief to about 5,000 containers over eight weeks and freed up more dock space, speeding goods flow in and out of the Port of Savannah.<br></li><li><strong>Secured commitments to move towards 24/7 operations </strong>via a Presidential call to action to encourage every link in the goods movement chain to move towards a 24/7 pace to increase the volume and pace of products flowing through the system. The Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach and International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU) workers joined together to make the first commitment. Some of the countries’ largest companies joined in as well—including Walmart, Target, FedEx, UPS, Home Depot, Best Buy, The Gap, and Samsung—committing to try a new solution.</li></ul>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Hotel Washington<br>Washington, D.C.</p>



<p>7:59 P.M. EDT<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Happy to do that.&nbsp; First, let me begin by thanking you all for your commitment to the environment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think maybe Mark is the only guy in here who knows that way back in the ‘80s, I wrote the first climate bill, and it didn&#8217;t go very far.&nbsp; We &#8212; we had rai- &#8212; (coughs) &#8212; excuse me &#8212; raised consciousness, but it didn&#8217;t go very far.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And let me began by saying: It is the existential threat to humanity.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s not hyperbole.&nbsp; And you got a chance to speak to my former &#8212; our former Secretary of State, John Kerry, who is as passionate about this as anybody in the world &#8212; for real.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve been going around the world trying to make sure that we keep the kind of commitment that the G28 did.&nbsp; At any rate, we &#8212; there&#8217;s a long way to go, but we&#8217;re running into some obstacles that I&#8217;m going to need your help on in terms of individuals, as well as circumstances.&nbsp; But we&#8217;ll get to that a little bit later.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, Lise, thank you for &#8212; for doing this.&nbsp; You know, it&#8217;s great to be with this group again.&nbsp; An awful lot of you here supported the campaign throughout and been with me throughout the first year and a half or so of my administration.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The climate crisis is the existential threat.&nbsp; That&#8217;s not hyperbole; it&#8217;s a fact.&nbsp; If we don&#8217;t keep it to 1.5 degrees Celsius &#8212; no warmer than that &#8212; we&#8217;re going to have &#8212; our kids are going to &#8212; our grandchildren will never forgive us, and the world will change.&nbsp; I mean, literal sense it will change.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And before we begin the discussion, I have three quick points.&nbsp; One, clean energy is a double-edged sword to deal with the climate crisis.&nbsp; Actually, it’s not even double-edged, it’s a triple-edged sword if we think of it in positive terms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When I had &#8212; years ago, when I was taken to a hospital with an aneurysm, the doctors explained to me what was going through and whether it was environmental or whether it was congenital.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I said, “Doc, I don&#8217;t need to know.&nbsp; It&#8217;s going to be okay.”&nbsp; He was operating at me.&nbsp; And he looked at me, and he said, “Your problem, Senator, is you&#8217;re a congenital optimist.” Well, in this job, you have to be.&nbsp; I always used to kid Barack, “A country is never going to be more optimistic than its president.”&nbsp; And I am optimistic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But there are three &#8212; three things we can deal with at the same time now: climate crisis, consumer costs, and national security.&nbsp; And they&#8217;re not at odds with one another if we look at it the right way; they&#8217;re compatible.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why we have to pass the other provisions in my Better Back &#8212; Build Back America plan.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In advance of our aggressive climate goals, we’re going to cut costs for families &#8212; an average of $500 a year.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not something anybody at this table worries about, but as my dad used to say, when everything from the price of gasoline to heating your home goes up, it&#8217;s a subject at the &#8212; at the dinner table.&nbsp; It&#8217;s real.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And &#8212; and so, that&#8217;s why this &#8212; my proposal advances aggressive climate goals, tax credits to weatherize homes and businesses, doubling America&#8217;s solar wind and &#8212; and other energy, lowering the price of electric vehicles, and &#8212; and much more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And in addition, the Russia and Ukraine is another reason why we have to get off our dependency on fossil fuels.&nbsp; Imagine where we&#8217;d be right now if, in fact, Europe was in fact energy- free of fossil fuels and was &#8212; we were in a situation where &#8212; (coughs) &#8212; excuse me &#8212; where &#8212; where we &#8212; it was all renewables.&nbsp; It&#8217;d be a different world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And &#8212; and so, we have to get off the dependency on fossil fuels &#8212; a subject matter I’ve spoken over, I don&#8217;t know, 75 to 100 times over the last four months; trying to keep NATO together and the EU.&nbsp; I mean, literally, not figuratively &#8212; meaning both here and there.&nbsp; And the dependence of Europe on fossil fuels is &#8212; way exceeds any dependence we have.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so, it&#8217;s not an immediate solution to the crisis, but it&#8217;s all about the future if we were to change the fossil fuel dependency.</p>



<p>Second thing: I&#8217;m going to continue to take executive actions where I can.&nbsp; The Court has overruled me a couple of times.&nbsp; But we created a climate office in the White House to carry out the whole-of-government effort to deal with climate.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve signed executive orders ranging from the most ambitious fuel economy standards for cars and trucks to taking on super-polluting hydrofluorocarbons.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re going to continue to be aggressive on the executive front as well.</p>



<p>The third thing is we have to continue to catalyze private investment and bring everybody along, which you all know much more about that than the vast majority of Americans.</p>



<p>And the infrastructure law &#8212; it was going to take us a long way.&nbsp; For example, we’re going to provide 500,000 charging stations for electric vehicles; that is motivating both utilities, car companies, and states to invest their own money in deploying these chargers as well.</p>



<p>Ford, General Motors are making historic investments in electric vehicles.&nbsp; GM says they will be 100 percent electric vehicles by &#8212; maybe by 2035; Ford says, by 2030, 50 percent of all their vehicles.&nbsp; And this proves we can deal with climate and &#8212; crisis &#8212; and jobs.&nbsp; This creates a lot of jobs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And the law also is going to help us build more climate resilience and deal with the record wildfires, floods, droughts, and other ways to get private sector into the game.</p>



<p>I have &#8212; I’ve gone to almost every major climate crisis we&#8217;ve had in the last year and a half.&nbsp; You know, you all know it, but more land has burned to the ground, including buildings and forest, than the entire square footage of New Jersey, in the West, and &#8212; primarily.</p>



<p>And, you know, we&#8217;ve had climate resilience to deal with the floods and droughts as well.&nbsp; I mean, now &#8212; you know, when the hurricane hit in Louisiana, the 170-mile-an-hour winds &#8212; 79-mile-an-hour winds &#8212; more people died in Queens from flooding than they died in that hurricane.&nbsp; Because when I went up there and visited &#8212; people went to their basements because of tornadoes and rain &#8212; 20 inches of rain.&nbsp; They &#8212; it flooded their basements; couldn&#8217;t get out, and died.</p>



<p>And so, you know, it&#8217;s another way to get the private sector into the game as well.&nbsp; Every place I go, the private sector is wanting to talk about what they can do and what they want to work with me to get done.</p>



<p>And &#8212; and, by the way, that brings everyone in: the labor unions; urban, rural and Tribal communities as well; and our young people &#8212; this is their generational cause.&nbsp; And so that&#8217;s the coalition we need to put together &#8212; business, labor, and &#8212; and including Tribal communities, and just the whole generation of young people who are &#8212; for example, my wi- &#8212; my daughter is a social worker.&nbsp; She is &#8212; runs a lot of Boys &amp; Girls Clubs around the &#8212; anyway, I called her tonight to tell her I love her.&nbsp; And her father-in-law is ill.&nbsp; And she said, “Dad, you&#8217;re talking about climate, right?&nbsp; Talking about climate.”&nbsp; And dad is talking about climate.</p>



<p>So the coalition we need to bring &#8212; bring together &#8212; is going to need your help.&nbsp; And &#8212; and there&#8217;s a lot more to say.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But rather than that, since I have a call with a foreign leader &#8212; I must leave by 8:40 at the latest &#8212; I &#8212; why don&#8217;t we get on with what you want to do ne- &#8212; tell me how you want to proceed?</p>



<p>And so, I’m supposed to turn it over to Nat right now.&nbsp; They told me &#8212; that’s what I’m told.</p>



<p>(The press departs.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">James S. Brady Press Briefing Room</p>



<p>3:25 P.M. EDT<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Hi, everyone.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hello.&nbsp; Good to see you.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Good to see you.&nbsp; Okay, I have nothing at the top for you.<br><br>Josh, what is on your mind?<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; Two questions. &nbsp;First, after the Rome meeting, since the war began, has China provided any military or economic aid to Russia or expressed any specific intentions to do so?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I&#8217;m not in a position to confirm or detail any intelligence from here at this point in time.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Moving on to the Russia-Ukraine talks: What does the U.S. see that would be a sign for optimism that some kind of ceasefire could be reached?&nbsp; And which carrots and which sticks do you think Putin is most responding to, if that’s the case &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; most likely to respond to?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; Well, as you&#8217;ve heard us say in the past, we certainly will continue to support the Ukrainian participation in these talks and conversations as long as they choose to continue to participate in them, of course.&nbsp; And we are trying to boost them by providing a range of not just economic and humanitarian assistance, but military assistance that we believe strengshens &#8212; strenghens &#8212; strengthens &#8212; excuse me &#8212; their positions in these talks.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Our view continues to be that, despite words that are said in these talks or coming out of these talks, diplomacy requires engaging in good faith to de-escalate.&nbsp; And what we&#8217;re really looking for is evidence of that.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re not seeing any evidence, at this point, that President Putin is doing anything to stop the onslaught or de-escalate.&nbsp; But that is really what we would be looking for.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.&nbsp; To follow up on the Rome meeting, what are the consequences for China if they do aid Russia?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I&#8217;m not going to get into specific consequences.&nbsp; I think what we have conveyed and what was conveyed by our National Security Advisor in this meeting is that should they provide military or other assistance that, of course, violates sanctions or supports the war effort, that there will be significant consequences.&nbsp;<br><br>But in terms of what the specifics look like, we would coordinate with our partners and allies to make that determination.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay. &nbsp;But Jake Sullivan certainly communicated that there would be consequences?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yes, as we have also said publicly a number of times.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; And then, is there anything you can share about the President&#8217;s potential meeting &#8212; potential trip to Europe in the next couple of weeks?&nbsp; Who he might be meeting with and really what the point would be of going to Europe?&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; Well, we are, of course, closely engaged with our NATO partners and European allies, as you heard us say a number of times, about the next steps in diplomacy, whether that&#8217;s providing additional humanitarian or security assistance or the mechanics for future conversations.&nbsp;<br><br>But there&#8217;s not been any final decision about a trip, so I don&#8217;t have anything to preview about what that would look like if he were to take a trip.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Go ahead.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; The President said back in February that the U.S. would respond forcefully if Americans were targeted in Ukraine.&nbsp; Brent Renaud was killed over the weekend.&nbsp; One of my colleagues was injured today.&nbsp; We&#8217;re still waiting to hear if he&#8217;s okay.&nbsp; So what is that response going to look like?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, let me first say: Your colleague, Benjamin Hall &#8212; I know there&#8217;s not final reports yet or we would wait for your news organization to confirm those &#8212; but our thoughts, the President&#8217;s thoughts, our administration’s thoughts are with him, his family, and all of you at Fox News as well.&nbsp;<br><br>In terms of specific actions, I think you have seen the President lead the world in taking &#8212; putting in place consequence &#8212; consequences, putting in place repercussions and steps in response to the actions of Russia &#8212; the brutal actions that have certainly impacted Ukrainian people and now have certainly impacted some Americans.&nbsp;<br><br>But in terms of next steps or what the next consequence would be, I don&#8217;t have anything to preview for you at this point in time.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But we&#8217;ve seen the President been, so far, unwilling to draw a red line on the kinds of atrocities that we&#8217;re going to watch from the sidelines.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve seen maternity wards being bombed, illegal weapons being used, pediatric hospitals being targeted.<br><br>President Obama drew the red line for Syria at chemical weapons.&nbsp; So is there any thought process about what we&#8217;re willing to watch happen before there&#8217;s &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, Jacqui, I think it&#8217;s important to reiterate as often as we can that what we&#8217;re seeing is horrific, what we&#8217;re seeing is barbaric.&nbsp; And the steps that the President has taken and led the world in taking have essentially led the Russian financial system to be on the brink of collapse.&nbsp; We have provided more military assistance to the Ukrainian military and the Ukrainian government than any other country in the world and more historic assistance than any other year to Ukraine in history.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re doing that so that we can support them in this difficult moment.&nbsp;<br><br>So I would say that, at this moment in time, we have been hardly on the sidelines.&nbsp; We have been leading this effort around the world to respond to every step and every escalatory step that President Putin and the Russians are taking.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But isn’t there a concern that if we don&#8217;t draw the line at something like chemical weapons, that it&#8217;ll make it easier for malign actors to use them in the future, because they&#8217;ll just go unpunished?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, Jacqui, I think that you heard the President say on Friday that there would be severe consequences and the world would respond if they were to use chemical weapons.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>And what we have been doing over the course of the last several weeks, if not months, is providing as much information to the global community, to the media, and to others about what to expect.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>And when you have President Putin suggesting &#8212; and Russian &#8212; Russian officials suggesting that the United States and Ukrainians are the ones who are working on a chemical weapons program, it&#8217;s clear that this is a pattern that we&#8217;ve seen in the past of them trying to set up a predicate for their own actions.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But what does &#8212; what does that end up looking like if the world responds?&nbsp; Because so far, we&#8217;ve heard the President talk a lot about what the U.S. is not going to do, in terms of, you know, not wanting to trigger war with a nuclear power.&nbsp; But do we believe that Putin is, you know, a rational kind of person who, you know, would pay attention to something like that?&nbsp; I mean, he didn&#8217;t need provocation to, you know, invade Ukraine. &nbsp;Why wouldn&#8217;t we think that he would just create a pretext that is fabricated for something like that?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We do.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why we&#8217;ve talked about it.&nbsp;<br><br>And I think, Jacqui, what&#8217;s important here is &#8212; and then I’m just going to move on to get to more people &#8212; is that for any President, you have to weigh how you can lead the world, how you can make very clear that actions are horrific, that they are not acceptable, they&#8217;re not aligned with global norms, while also thinking about our own national security interests.&nbsp; And starting World War Three is certainly not in our national security interests.&nbsp; Putting U.S. troops on the ground in Ukraine to fight a war with Russia is not in our national security interests.&nbsp;<br><br>Go ahead.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do have one &#8212; one quick &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I just have to move on because I &#8212; otherwise I’m not going to get to other people.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It’s a follow-up to what you had said though about misinformation and Twitter.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because, last year, the President worked with Twitter specifically to address misinformation on vaccines, called it a “wartime effort.”&nbsp; Has there been any conversations with Twitter to address misinformation as it pertains to chemical attacks and that kind of thing, given that the &#8212; you know, Russia has banned this platform within the country and they&#8217;re using it to, obviously, target eyes outside of the country, including within the U.S., to spread propaganda and misinformation?&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We were the ones who told you all about that.<br><br>I agree.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have anything to read out for you in terms of private conversations with Twitter or any other social platform.&nbsp; But I&#8217;m happy to check and see if there&#8217;s more.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Back on the Rome talks.&nbsp; Have you seen any &#8212; or did you &#8212; your colleagues see in this meeting any sign that China got the message, that they are going to heed your warnings?&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, what we&#8217;re going to be watching closely, of course, is actions.&nbsp; So beyond that, I think, as my colleagues just &#8212; just read out for you in a call that we delayed the briefing slightly to make sure you could all participate in: It was an intense seven-hour session reflecting the gravity of the moment.&nbsp; And it was an opportunity to be very clear about what you&#8217;ve heard our National Security Advisor convey publicly but more directly about what the consequences would be.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, you know, your colleagues have said that your deep concerns were conveyed about what would happen if China were to align more closely with Russia.&nbsp; Just, big picture: If China does not heed the U.S.’s warnings, if they do move forward with this, how concerned are you that this is inching closer to the world war that the President has been warning of?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I think what we&#8217;re looking at here &#8212; one is: If China were to decide to be an economic provider, or to take additional steps, there to Russia, they only make up 15 percent or 20 &#8212; 15 to 20 percent of the world&#8217;s economy.&nbsp; The G7 countries make up more than 50 percent.&nbsp; So there are a range of tools at our disposal in coordination with our European partners should we need to use them.<br><br>But, again, we are &#8212; don&#8217;t have anything to update you on in terms of an assessment.&nbsp; This is obviously an area we&#8217;re watching closely.&nbsp;<br><br>While this meeting has been planned for some time as a follow-up from the November call that pres- &#8212; the President had with President Xi, it was a timely &#8212; an important moment to have this conversation, especially given the reports we&#8217;ve seen and &#8212; and the invasion, of course, of Ukraine.&nbsp;<br><br>Go ahead.&nbsp; Oh, one more?&nbsp; Go ahead..<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just one quick follow-up, actually, to Jacqui’s questions &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; about chemical weapons.&nbsp; You know, the President, as you noted, said on Friday that Russia would pay a severe price.&nbsp; What would that price look like?&nbsp; Are we talking in the realm of more sanctions?&nbsp; Can you give us sort of any big picture about what that would entail?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; That would be a conversation that we would have with our partners around the world.&nbsp;<br><br>But there&#8217;s no question if Russia were to decide to use chemical weapons, there would be a severe reaction from the global community.<br><br>Go ahead.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So when you talk about, kind of, the possibilities for China if they don&#8217;t go along with what you&#8217;ve asked, would you say, like you&#8217;ve said with Russia, that “everything is on the table,” including ending trade negotiations, sanctions?&nbsp; Is that all on the table?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I’m just not going to be in a position to detail it further from here.&nbsp; We&#8217;ll see.&nbsp; We&#8217;ll keep having this conversation over the coming days.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But you won&#8217;t do nothing if China decides to provide military support?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We’ve been clear there would be consequences.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And that you would &#8212; you all would initiate?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yes.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; And then, what&#8217;s kind of your end &#8212; thinking about what an endgame looks like, as far as these conversations with China, do you want them to shift their strategic priorities and not have a relationship with Russia that it does now?&nbsp; Or are you looking for something more modest?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; It’s less about changing their mind and more about making clear with them what the consequences would be should they take additional actions to support this invasion.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the additional $200 million in security assistance &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; the President signed off on this past weekend, an official said that part of it would go to anti-armor and anti-aircraft systems.&nbsp; I know the Pentagon says it&#8217;s still kind of in process right now.&nbsp; Are these &#8212; are we talking about weapon systems that have already been delivered, or is there consideration of new types of weapon systems in this tranche of funding?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; It&#8217;s a good question, Phil.&nbsp; My understanding &#8212; and just to give you all more detail: This weekend, as I think you all saw it, we announced &#8212; and I think this is why you&#8217;re asking &#8212; the President authorized an additional $200 million of security assistance, which utilizes the maximum amount of funding available to provide Ukrainians with the type of weapons they are using so effectively.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s really a continuity, as I understand it &#8212; let me double check this for you &#8212; of the type of weapons that they have been using very effectively on the ground to push back on Russia, both in the air and on the ground.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>So that includes, as you &#8212; as you noted, anti-armor, anti-tank, and air defense capabilities and ammunition of other types, and other types of assistance to address the armored, airborne, and other threats that they are facing.</p>



<p>But my understanding, Phil, is it&#8217;s a continuation of the types of security assistance that we have been providing.&nbsp; And, of course, the President is looking forward to &#8212; there&#8217;s a significant amount of funding, as I think you all have noted, in the omnibus for Ukraine, which would enable us to provide even additional assistance to add to that package.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; And then just a quick follow-up to one of Josh&#8217;s questions.&nbsp; The Deputy Secretary of State this weekend said, quote, she&#8217;d seen some signs of “willingness to have real, serious negotiations.”&nbsp; I think that differed a little bit from what we&#8217;ve heard from officials about the Russian posture up to this point.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Can you elaborate on what the signs may have been &#8212; may have been seen in terms of giving the Deputy Secretary of State that view of things?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, she also said that they would have to back any words with actions, essentially, which I think is an important context.&nbsp; Right?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>They did have talks today.&nbsp; There have been reports that they will have additional talks.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve been very appreciative of the efforts of our allies &#8212; France, Germany, Israel, and Turkey, and others &#8212; to be participants in these talks at times or engage in these talks at times.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>But, again, diplomacy requires both sides engaging in good faith and to deescalate.&nbsp; And what we&#8217;re really looking for is specific delivery of actions.</p>



<p>I think it&#8217;s important to remember that there have been five or six attempts to implement a humanitarian corridor.&nbsp; Those have not been effective.&nbsp; Those have not worked.&nbsp; You&#8217;ve seen, through video footage and others’ reports, that those &#8212; that has not been abided by.&nbsp; So that is where we are keeping our eye and focus.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead, Kelly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you get a sense that as this conflict with Russia and Ukraine is happening, that other actors that are adversaries to the United States &#8212; China, Iran, North Korea &#8212; are also testing the West, with China&#8217;s work with Russia, as you&#8217;re dealing with that, perhaps with Taiwan; Iran with its rockets; North Korea also showing its provocative nature?</p>



<p>Is there a test of the West coming from some of the adversaries of the United States?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We have not assessed those to be related, as you have said.&nbsp; I mean, if you look at the Iran &#8212; the missile strike that we saw over the weekend, no U.S. facilities were hit, no personnel were harmed.&nbsp; We were not the targets of that.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve obviously seen tests and information we put out publicly as it relates to North Korea.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve seen dozens of tests over the course of past administrations as well.&nbsp; So I would say we are not assessing it through those &#8212; that prism.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Has the administration reached out to American companies that have property, infrastructure in Russia &#8212; to expect that to be nationalized by Russia and to lose those assets in Russia?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We have been, of course, engaged with U.S. companies &#8212; not encouraging them; obviously, we&#8217;ve &#8212; publicly applauding them.&nbsp; But they&#8217;re going to make their own decisions as private sector companies.&nbsp;<br><br>We&#8217;ve also conveyed, as we did publicly, I think on Friday, that there would be &#8212; we would certainly look to consequences should that happen.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The former White House COVID Advisor, Andy Slavitt, has a Twitter thread today in which he talks about the potential for an increase in COVID cases this spring.&nbsp; He says, “Based on European case increases, the U.S. could see a new rise in COVID cases…”&nbsp; Are you confident the administration has the real-time data it needs to provide the best information possible to the public?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; To pr- &#8212; to assess data?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yes, we are.&nbsp; I would note that &#8212; I did not see his tread &#8212; his thread, but let me note &#8212; and I&#8217;m not sure if it was related to the BA.2 variant.&nbsp; Was it related to the BA.2 variant?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; What we do know about the BA.2 variant, which I think is important context for people, is that it&#8217;s circulated in the United States for some time.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve been watching it closely, of course.&nbsp; We currently have about 35,000 cases in this country.&nbsp; We expect some fluctuation, especially at this relatively low level, and, certainly, that to increase.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I would also note that while BA.2 is more transmissi- &#8212; is a more transmissible version of Omicron, the tools we have &#8212; including mRNA vaccines, therapeutics, and tests &#8212; are all effective tools against the virus.&nbsp; And we know because it&#8217;s been in the country.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so, as we&#8217;re watching, and I think a lot of the reporting has been about, of course, the UK but also China.&nbsp; And China has a zero-tolerance policy, as you all know, but they also did not conduct their vaccination and booster campaigns with mRNA vaccine.&nbsp; So that is important context, too, as you&#8217;re seeing the impact.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>What I would note, just to go back to your earlier part of your question, is that we are still pressing &#8212; the place where it is concerning is the fact that we need additional COVID funding.&nbsp; And we have talked about this &#8212; we talked about this a little bit in the past, but &#8212; last week &#8212; all running together.&nbsp;<br><br>But &#8212; but without COVID response resources and additional money, there could be immediate impacts on testing capacity; the uninsured fund, which offers coverage of testing and treatments for tens of millions of Americans who lack health insurance; and on our supply of monoclonal antibodies.&nbsp; And that means that some programs, if we don&#8217;t get funding, could abruptly end or need to be pared back.&nbsp; And that could impact how we are able to respond to any variant, of course.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do just want to ask you one more &#8212;&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; quick question.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We noticed the President, when he came on stage today at the Marriott, had a mask on.&nbsp; Is that something he has been advised to do, or is that something he just feels more comfortable doing?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Often he does that when it&#8217;s required by a specific event, as he did when he went to Texas last week.&nbsp; I can certainly check on that.&nbsp; He was tested yesterday and tested negative.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; So, on Ukraine, the President has made clear that he sort of has a red line with Russia, in terms of not wanting to do anything that would get into a direct confrontation or lead to World War Three, as he puts it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I&#8217;m curious &#8212; I know you&#8217;re not sharing specifics, but in broad strokes, does he have a similar red line now with China assisting Russia?&nbsp; And are &#8212; is the &#8212; does he not want to get into a direct confrontation with China?&nbsp; And are there certain things he&#8217;s not willing to do because of that?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Let me see if I can answer your question, but tell me if I&#8217;m not.&nbsp;<br><br>We don&#8217;t like red lines around here, so I&#8217;m not going to use that phrasing.&nbsp; But you are obviously correct that what he is &#8212; he’s been very clear and consistent about his &#8212; that he does not have the intention of sending U.S. troops to Ukraine.&nbsp; That has not changed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I would look at &#8212; while we are certainly watching closely the actions of China, whether &#8212; whether that is support of any kind &#8212; in support of any kind for Russia, and certainly there would be consequences to that &#8212; I do think we look at it through a slightly different prism.&nbsp; I mean, Russia is invading Ukraine actively.&nbsp; So, I&#8217;m not &#8212; but I&#8217;m not sure if I&#8217;m answering your question or not.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, sort of.&nbsp; Just to follow up, I mean &#8212; right, no ground troops in Ukraine, but also, there have been other things, such as not enforcing a no-fly zone or not providing the fighter jets &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; that the President has been reluctant to do.&nbsp; So, again, you said you&#8217;re not sharing specifics.&nbsp; You said Jake Sullivan said “significant consequences” for the Chinese.&nbsp; But I&#8217;m wondering if there are certain things that you will not consider because it could lead to a direct confrontation with China that you&#8217;re reluctant to get into, the same way you are with Russia.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I just think we look at it slightly differently.&nbsp; I mean, what I&#8217;m talking &#8212; what we &#8212; why the President has been so clear about not sending U.S. troops is obviously because that would be a military conflict.&nbsp; We’re not fighting, obviously, in a &#8212; there&#8217;s no military conflict at this moment with China, nor do we &#8212; nor are we predicting that.&nbsp; So I think we just &#8212; it&#8217;s slightly different.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And one just on a &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; different topic.&nbsp; How high is the administration expecting gas prices to go?&nbsp; And how much &#8212; is there a limit &#8212; not a red line but a limit at what you think &#8212; (laughter) &#8212; the U.S. public can bear?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Just flows off the tongue.&nbsp; (Laughs.)&nbsp; It&#8217;s okay.<br><br>So it&#8217;s a good question.&nbsp; We don&#8217;t have &#8212; I don&#8217;t have a prediction from here, in terms of what it could look like.&nbsp; There are outside predictors, of course.&nbsp; And, obviously, what we&#8217;re trying to do is mitigate the impact.&nbsp; You know, and you&#8217;ve seen, of course, you know, the price of oil go down a little bit.&nbsp; And the President will continue to look at a range of steps that he can take, whether it is engaging through his team, or through even himself personally, with big global producers, or it is looking at a range of domestic options.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>But we&#8217;ve seen it go up.&nbsp; I mean, we look at a lot of the same data you look at &#8212; AAA and other data &#8212; that shows us how much it has gone up since the period of time when Russian troops lined up on the border.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>But in terms of how far &#8212; you know, we still believe it will continue to go up, but we&#8217;re trying to take steps we can take to mitigate that and reduce it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead, Mara.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; I understand you don&#8217;t want to lay out what the severe consequences would be if Russia used chemical weapons, but I guess what I&#8217;m confused about is we know there&#8217;s not going to be any U.S. troops, no jets, no no-fly zone.&nbsp; Other than the things you&#8217;ve already done, which you have already described as severe, could you give us some examples of what more you can do since you&#8217;ve ruled out all these things?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just &#8212; when you talk about severe consequences, what does that mean, given that we know what it doesn&#8217;t mean?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; I &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I understand your question.&nbsp; I&#8217;m just not going to outline that from here.&nbsp; Those are conversations that will happen &#8212; continue to happen with our national security team and with our partners and allies around the world.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But what you&#8217;re asking us to believe is that there are severe consequences that you haven&#8217;t used yet but that are not on the “no” list?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Correct.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; But you won&#8217;t tell us what kinds of things those might be?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We&#8217;re going to have those conversations privately through our national security team and with our partners around the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; But &#8212; but do you &#8212; I guess what I&#8217;m wondering &#8212; what about the argument that there just aren&#8217;t any more severe consequences for you to use because most of the severe ones you&#8217;ve ruled out?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; That&#8217;s inaccurate.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Go ahead.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just on the Fed nominations &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nice try, Mara.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; does the White House have any assurances from any Republican senators that they would support Sarah Bloom Raskin’s nomination?&nbsp; And did Senator Manchin give the President or anyone in the administration a heads up about his opposition to her &#8212; to her nomination?&nbsp; I&#8217;m trying to figure out if that was a surprise.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; I understand your question.&nbsp; We were aware of his position in advance of his &#8212; of Senator Manchin’s announcement.&nbsp; We are &#8212; she is one of the most qualified individuals to ever be nominated to this position.&nbsp; And so where we are now is &#8212; our focus is on continuing to work with Chairman &#8212; Chairman Brown to garner bipartisan support.&nbsp; But I don&#8217;t have anything to read out for you on that front at this point.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How did Senator Manchin make you aware that &#8212; of his opposition?&nbsp; Was there a call to someone in the White House?&nbsp;&nbsp; Did the President know?&nbsp; What did that look like today?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I’m just not going to detail more specifics.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; And just one last question, if you don&#8217;t mind.&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yep.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How is the administration preparing to respond to the potential supplies chain shock &#8212; excuse me &#8212; posed by China&#8217;s decision to lock down the tech production hub in Shenzhen?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; So we are, of course, monitoring this incredibly closely, and our team is quite focused on it.&nbsp; What I will say is that, because of the steps we&#8217;ve taken and a number of steps we&#8217;ve taken to better &#8212; better prepare and strengthen the supply chain, you know, we &#8212; we feel that that has helped us &#8212; will help us sustain.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>But in terms of &#8212; right now, we&#8217;re basically in the stage where we&#8217;re monitoring with the State Department.&nbsp; What we&#8217;re looking at is, of course, as you know, the impact on some of these ports around where &#8212; the impacted areas of China.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>And we know here that, of course, our Port Action Plan and the work of our Supply Chain Disruptions Task Force, that we have a strong inventory that we can rely on.  It&#8217;s about 90 percent of goods at groceries and drugstores are in stock currently. And we&#8217;ve also reduced the number of import containers sitting at the docks for over nine days by over 60 percent.  <br><br>But in terms of specific impacts of ports in China, we&#8217;re monitoring it, and we don&#8217;t have a new assessment at this &#8212; in additi- &#8212; up-to-date assessment, I should say, at this point in time.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q    Thanks, Jen.  Is it the U.S. assessment, just to be clear, that Russia is deliberately targeting civilians in Ukraine?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Well, this is part of our assessment and review as we&#8217;re looking at how we&#8217;re &#8212; whether we will designate as a war crime.  And we look at this through a legal process internally.  Obviously, the targeting of civilians &#8212; and we have seen a range of very concerning video reports &#8212; other would be categorized in that &#8212; through that as &#8212; in that phrasing, but we have a process that we&#8217;re still working through here.<br><br>Q    And then, last week at a briefing, you told us that us, as reporters, should, quote, “not focus a lot” of our conversations “about the future of the United States importing oil at this point…from Venezuela.”  Were you ruling out that the U.S. would import oil from Venezuela (inaudible)?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  I was saying it&#8217;s not an active conversation at this time.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q    Hi, thanks.  Does the White House have any reaction to Ginni Thomas acknowledging that she attended the January 6th rally?  <br><br>MS. PSAKI:  I do not.<br><br>Q    And just kind of on that: Does her attendance there raise any kind of concerns about the independence of the Supreme Court, potential conflicts of interest, anything like that?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  I just don&#8217;t have any more comment on it at this point in time.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q    Hi, Jen.  For the second time in two weeks, a group of hundreds of Haitian migrants has landed by boat in the Florida Keys.  Given the surge we saw last year in Del Rio of Haitian migration, what is the administration&#8217;s reaction to these landings?  Are there any plans to send any assistance either to Haiti or Florida?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  I&#8217;m sure we can get you an update on the humanitarian assistance we provide directly to Haiti.  We are the largest, if not one of the largest, providers of humanitarian assistance in the world.  In terms of the individuals arriving, I think in Florida, as you said &#8212;<br><br>Q    Yeah, the Florida Keys.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  &#8212; I would really point you to the Department of Homeland Security.  We are still applying Title 42, and so that applies no matter which country you&#8217;re coming from.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q    Hi, yeah.  The President of Colombia said last week that he had offered President Biden the possibility of supplying more Colombian oil to the U.S. as an alternative to Venezuelan oil.  Is that an option that the White House is considering?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  We are continuing to talk to a range of producers on the importance of maintaining global supply.  This is not, as you know, about just the supply in the U.S. but about ensuring there is supply for the global market.  And we do appreciate our partnership with Colombia.  And President Biden did discuss a range of issues like economic recovery, energy security during their conversation.  But beyond that, I don&#8217;t have an update on what that might look like.<br><br>Q    Would you say that it is under active consideration as &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Again, they had a &#8212; they had a wide-ranging conversation, a very constructive conversation.  This is really about supply in the global markets.  But I don&#8217;t have an update at this point in time.<br><br>Q    Yeah.  And as a follow-up, Chevron is preparing to take operating control of its joint ventures in Venezuela &#8212; Reuters just reported that &#8212; in case the U.S. would grant them a special license to operate.  Is that something that&#8217;s on the table?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  I think I just answered it a few minutes ago.<br><br>Go ahead.  Go ahead.<br><br>Q    Oh, yeah.  Thanks, Jen.  You said earlier in the press briefing that nothing has been decided about President Biden traveling to Europe.”  Can you confirm that such a trip is under consideration?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  We discuss a range of ways and mechanics for engaging with our friends and partners around the world, but I don&#8217;t have any more specifics for you at this point in time.<br><br>Q    Okay.  And this morning, Leader Schumer and Speaker Pelosi announced that Zelenskyy &#8212; President Zelenskyy of Ukraine &#8212; <br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.<br><br>Q    &#8212; will be delivering an address to the full House and Senate on Wednesday morning.  What&#8217;s the White House reaction to this address?  Are there any concerns that the White House has about the Ukrainian President speaking directly with Congress as opposed to the White House on its various positions and requests?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  We speak frequently with President Zelenskyy.  The President spoke with him &#8212; had a lengthy conversation with him directly on Friday, and we&#8217;re in touch with Ukrainian government officials nearly every day &#8212; not every day. <br><br>We certainly support leaders in Congress inviting him to address a joint session.  And I would again reiterate that there&#8217;s strong, bipartisan support for Ukraine, for the leadership, and the bravery of President Zelenskyy.  And we&#8217;ll all look forward to watching his speech on Wednesday.<br><br>Q    And then, finally, on Sarah Bloom Raskin and Senator Manchin’s announcement that he doesn&#8217;t support her confirmation: Does the White House still see a path to getting her confirmed in the evenly divided Senate?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  We are going to continue our work with Chairman Brown to garner bipartisan support.  But again, she is one of the most qualified individuals ever to be nominated to this position.  So that&#8217;s where our focus is.<br><br>Q    So you are pushing her forward still and &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Yes.<br><br>Q    &#8212; and believe that you can get her &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Yes.<br><br>Q    &#8212; confirmed?  Okay.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  That is where our focus is.  We wouldn&#8217;t be pushing for bipartisan support if she wasn&#8217;t still our nominee. <br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q    Thanks, Jen.  Two questions on WNBA star Brittney Griner.  Last week you had said you couldn&#8217;t comment on the case.  Is there any update you can give now on the efforts the administration may be taking to secure her release?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  We do not have a Privacy Act waiver.<br><br>Q    Okay.  And does the White House have any reason to believe that Griner is being used as a political pawn by the Russian government?  Or does the administration see this strictly as part of the Russian criminal justice<br>system? <br><br>MS. PSAKI:  We just can&#8217;t speak any more to the reports of this case. <br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q    Hey, Jen.  Thank you very much, Jen.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  I’ll come back to you.  Go ahead.<br><br>Q    Thank you.  On the possible trip to Europe: Is President Biden considering visiting, maybe, perhaps the Ukrainian border and visit refugees &#8212; Ukrainian refugees &#8212; like other foreign leaders are doing?  Is this something you&#8217;d like to do?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  I just don&#8217;t have anything more on the reports.  Again, we have a range of conversations with our NATO partners and European allies about the next steps in diplomacy, but I don&#8217;t have anything to confirm for you in terms of the report.<br><br>Q    And just one more.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.<br><br>Q    Not just China but some of the biggest countries in the world, like India or Brazil, some countries in Latin America like Mexico, they&#8217;re not part of this economic war &#8212; warfare against Russia.  Is this something that undermine the efforts from this White House and European countries?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  I would say it doesn&#8217;t undermine our efforts.  We&#8217;ve been working to build a global coalition far beyond the G7 and our NATO partners, and had a great deal of success in that.  And every country has to decide where they want to stand, where they want to be as we look and the history books are written.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q    And you believe the &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  I think we&#8217;ve got to move on.  We&#8217;ve got to get around.  <br><br>Q    Just very quickly.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Okay.<br><br>Q    Do you just believe this economic pressure will stop Vladimir Putin from his invasion?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Well, I think as we&#8217;ve seen, the impact of the President&#8217;s leadership on the global stage and the economic consequences that have been put into place have led Russia and the Russian economy to be on the brink of collapse.  And there&#8217;s no question that, over time, that will have an impact.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q    Oh, actually &#8212; thank you.  Furthering that point, you did mention at the top of this briefing that there has been no action on the part of Putin to stop the onslaught; you haven&#8217;t seen any action. <br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Mm-hmm.<br><br>Q    And that is after, again, all of these severe economic sanctions have been levied.  And so, you know, I&#8217;m wondering why the administration thinks that this threat of further severe action that is vague, that is unnamed will deter him from using chemical weapons.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Well, I think the reason that we spoke out last week about chemical weapons is because we felt that it was important for the global community to understand that they had the capacity, the capabilities, and that they have used them in the past.  And at the same time, they were accusing, inaccurately &#8212; they were spreading false information about the U.S. and the Ukrainians’ intentions.  That was the origin of why we were so outspoken last week. <br><br>So, this is more about us making clear to the world what we&#8217;ve seen as patterns in the past and what their capabilities and capacities are.  <br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q    Thank you, Jen.  President Biden has repeatedly said, “No U.S. troops inside Ukraine.”<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Mm-hmm.<br><br>Q    Are there any U.S. troops still training Ukrainians outside Ukraine?  And if not, could that be a thing, as we move<br>forward, if this turns into (inaudible)?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:   You mean in neighboring countries?<br><br>Q    Yeah, like bases outside Ukraine.  And if it becomes a long-term conflict, as obviously many predict, would that be a thing the United States does?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Let &#8212; let me check with the Department of Defense.  We obviously had trainers on the ground for a period of time.  We hadn’t &#8212; then we pulled them back.  We obviously have a significant military presence in a range of countries in the region, but I can see if there&#8217;s anything that we are looking ahead to.<br><br>Q    That wouldn’t be considered an escalatory type of thing?  You know, a bit like the MiGs, which got complicated because no one knew kind of how to get them to the Ukrainians.  Like, if you had Ukrainian soldiers going into Poland &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Sure.<br><br>Q    &#8212; being trained by U.S. troops to go back and fight Russians.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  I mean, I think, really, our focus right now is on providing them and continuing to expedite the military assistance to them.  And the good news is that we still &#8212; through our coordination with them and our NATO Allies, we’re able to get them that assistance on the ground.  They&#8217;re actively fighting now, so that&#8217;s where our focus really is at this point in time. <br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q    Yeah, on the Federal Reserve: Would the administration then support the four nominees, who seem to have the votes to be confirmed, to go forward and deal with the Raskin nominee after?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Well, there&#8217;s enough support to move all five nominees through the committee.  So we think the Republicans should show up so that they can vote them through the committee.<br><br>Q    And on &#8212; one last thing.  The fact that China is in the conversation about helping Russia, should U.S. companies then look at maybe decoupling from China with their investments there and be cautious?  What&#8217;s the message that you have?  Can you trust the Chinese?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s about trust, but we have not made an ask or a request at this point of that. <br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q    Jen, thank you.  At the Democratic retreat in Philadelphia last week, some of my colleagues were hearing a lot from Democratic lawmakers who want the President to do more by executive action, whether it&#8217;s on immigration or whether it is on some of the other priorities of the administration.  Did he have any conversations with the members there about possible further executive actions?  And is there anything else &#8212; I think you&#8217;re hearing from the members in those meetings with the Black Caucus and other members of Congress in the last week or two &#8212; that may be coming forward?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Well, I would say all of these members can speak for themselves on what they&#8217;re interested in and what they&#8217;re requesting from the President and from this administration. <br><br>We have a range of executive authorities &#8212; the President does, I should say, has a range of executive authorities.  I think there have been some reports about some that are under consideration, including one on policing, which we have talked about a bit in the past. <br><br>So, sure, we still continue to consider what steps we can take through executive actions, even as we work with Congress to see what we can move through there as well.<br><br>Q    And I take it that there&#8217;s no update beyond the legal review continuing on the student loan question. <br><br>MS. PSAKI:  I don&#8217;t have an update at this point in time.  No.<br><br>Go ahead in the back.  Go ahead.<br><br>Q    Thank you.  Me?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Okay.  And then I&#8217;ll go to your friend next to you. <br><br>Q    Thank you very much.  On North Korea, it is reported that the North Koreans’ ICBM launch is imminent.  Do you have anything on the North Korea&#8217;s imminent launch (inaudible) ICBM?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  I don&#8217;t have anything on that report.  I&#8217;ve not seen that report.  What I can tell you is that, you know, as you know, last week, we proactively decided to reveal information publicly about recent tests and share it with allies and partners as well as Congress. <br><br>We have seen North Korea escalate its testing in different periods over the last four presidents.  And this time, North Korea hid these tests, unlike the fanfare over past tests.<br><br>But I don&#8217;t have anything to predict in terms of the future. <br><br>I said I’d go to &#8212; go ahead.<br><br>Q    Japan and some of the other treaty countries are increasingly alarmed after Afghanistan and this recent situation.  Could you let the Japanese government know that the Security Treaty will be honored? <br><br>And then second, for those of us that were embedded during the war, the whole situation with Afghanistan is quite personal.  There&#8217;s a large number of our people that helped us that are still left.  Could you just update us on &#8212; almost six months &#8212; whether they&#8217;ll be able to come back?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Well, I would say on the second part, that that is one of the reasons that we&#8217;ve worked so closely with our Qatari &#8212; with the Qataris to maintain a diplomatic presence there so that we continue to engage with neighboring countries to bring people home and help some of our partners and allies who stood by our side, fought by our side over the course of the 20-year war.  That&#8217;s ongoing. <br><br>In terms of the numbers, I would point you to the State Department who would have the most up-to-date numbers. <br><br>I&#8217;m not sure I understand your first question.<br><br>Q    Well, just a reassurance to Japan and a lot of the countries that have treaties with us that are worried &#8212; you know, if a situation like this develops, if those treaties are going to be honored. <br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Which situation?  How would it relate to Japan?<br><br>Q    Well, Afghanistan is a long partner of ours.  And so,<br>you know, the whole situation that&#8217;s happening now &#8212; Taiwan &#8212; there&#8217;s a great concern that if you have a treaty and it comes to a difficult situation, whether it&#8217;s really going to be honored.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  We&#8217;ve never stepped back from the commitments we&#8217;ve made under the Taiwan Relations Act.  And the President stands by those. <br><br>Go ahead, James.<br><br>Q    Thank you very much, Jen.  Two questions on Russia/Ukraine.  Prior to February 24, the President, our NATO Allies, and the EU were embarked on a deterrence project.  That&#8217;s exactly the word that you and other senior U.S. officials used at the time. <br><br>Quite clearly, the invasion was launched on the 24th of February.  And so we can say, as a factual matter, that that deterrence project failed.  Is it the view of the White House that Mr. Putin could not be deterred by any set of steps?  Or are you willing to concede that perhaps some other set of steps by the President and our allies might have deterred the invasion?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  You know, James, I would say that when we put in place the threat of sanctions and the threat of consequences, we never thought that that would be failproof or that would be 100 percent effective.  We did that because we wanted to lay out the clear consequences should President Putin proceed in invading Ukraine, even as we predicted, quite consistently, that that was very much his intention. <br><br>And what we have done since that point in time is implement those sanctions and implement those consequences, far beyond what I think most people&#8217;s expectations were in the world about what those would look like.  <br><br>I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s &#8212; I don&#8217;t think I can look in a rearview mirror, or any of us can, and predict what would have been different.  What we did is we took steps to rally the world to stand up to the aggressions of President Putin.  And we have implemented them and followed up on what we committed to since that point in time.<br><br>Q    One key decision made by the President early on was to remove strategic ambiguity from this equation.  Never really was Mr. Putin forced to wonder what consequences he would face.  He was told at the outset he would never face military intervention by the United States and NATO, that the full range of the punishments he would face would amount to diplomatic and economic sanctions. <br><br>I think a lot of people wonder why a greater effort wasn&#8217;t made to leave Mr. Putin in doubt about the consequences he might face.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Because the President is the President of the United States of America, and he felt it was important to be clear with the American people about what his intentions were and what they were not.  <br><br>And his intentions were not to send men and women, their sons and daughters to fight a war in Ukraine against Russia. <br><br>Go ahead. <br><br>Q    Thank you.  On Iran. <br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Okay, I&#8217;ll do bo- &#8212; go ahead.  Ladies first.  Okay, go ahead.<br><br>Q    Thank you.  On Iran: The Iran talks appeared to have stalled amid some last-minute demands by Russia.  Are the Iran talks dead?  And if not, what now?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Well, right now, the negotiators are back home in their capitals.  We&#8217;ll see what happens in the days ahead with diplomacy around the deal. <br><br>We continue to believe that, you know, obviously, a diplomatic path forward is the best path forward.  But this is a natural part of the process.  It is also standard for the most difficult parts of the conversation &#8212; negotiations to be happening at the end. <br><br>Q    And then, just on Ukraine: South African President Cyril Ramaphosa says he&#8217;s been asked to mediate between Russia and Ukraine.  Would the White House support that, endorse that, in any way assist with that, especially since the African model kind of tends towards, like, restorative justice, truth, and reconciliation instead of, you know, traditional justice?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  I&#8217;m happy to check with our national security team on his role.<br><br>What I can tell you is that there have been a half a dozen global leaders who have been meeting with both the Russians and the Ukrainians and engaging, of course, directly through diplomatic channels and trying to come to a diplomatic conclusion here.<br><br>We have been engaged directly with them on the front end and back end of those conversations, and encourage them to also make sure they are engaging with the Ukrainians and not just the Russians.<br><br>But I will check if there&#8217;s any specific &#8212;<br><br>Q    (Inaudible) South Africans about this offer (inaudible)?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  I&#8217;m happy to check specifically.  But again, there&#8217;s a range of countries that are already playing this role.  So &#8212;<br><br>Go ahead.  In the &#8212; go ahead.<br><br>Q    With the COVID &#8212; thank you, by the way.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Sure.<br><br>Q    With COVID funds falling off the omnibus &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.<br><br>Q    &#8212; and it may take a bit &#8212; you know, if Congress kind of (inaudible) get done &#8212; has the White House ask changed at all?  Have they come back to, you know, lawmakers and said, “Hey, while it’s going to take a while, you know, we need more,” or it’s in a different place?  I’m just curious how that &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  You mean in terms of asking for less money or something like that?   Or &#8212;<br><br>Q    Or more?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Or more money.  Yeah.<br><br>Q    You know, my question is: What is the timing &#8212; and does the timing change the needs of the White House?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Well, the time &#8212; I mean, we&#8217;re asking for money to meet exactly the needs that are going to start to come up soon in the coming &#8212; in the coming weeks even, and in supporting a number of the programs that have been pivotal to people across this country, especially people who are uninsured, people who are relying on access to free treatments, testing, vaccines.<br><br>Obviously, these are programs that it&#8217;s not only in the United &#8212; in the U.S. government&#8217;s interest to continue, but it&#8217;s in the interest of the American people, especially people who don&#8217;t have the resources to cover and pay for a lot of these different treatments. <br><br>We had originally &#8212; we had requested $22.5 billion, I think you&#8217;re aware, for immediate and urgent COVID response needs because that is the funding we felt we needed.  That does not mean it would cover the needs in &#8212; forever.  That would just be the needs we have at this moment in time. <br><br>So these conversations are still ongoing with leaders in Congress.  We are &#8212; but we want to be very clear about the fact that some of these programs could abruptly end and be pared back without additional funding.<br><br>Q    A real quick follow-up.  Just &#8212; you mentioned the uninsured, about the HRSA program that reimburses from uninsured funds.  You guys previously said that would end this month.  Is that timeline still there?  I mean, is that &#8212; <br><br>MS. PSAKI:  You mean if we don&#8217;t have funding?<br><br>Q    Yeah.  Is it still the end of the month they shut that down?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  A lot of these programs could end quite abruptly.  So, it could.  But I will check and see if that specific one would.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q    Jen, real quick on Title 42 &#8212; two related questions. <br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.<br><br>Q    One of them: Democratic senators and congresspeople and activists are criticizing the President.  During the campaign, he said that this Trump-era policy was inhumane, yet he&#8217;s keeping it, even though the country is opening again.  But then, a few days back, the CDC decided to let unaccompanied minors in.  So the fear is that this is going to make a lot of parents just send their children by themselves and lead to another humanitarian tragedy at the border.  <br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Well, I would say, first &#8212; I mean, as you&#8217;ve noted, the CDC makes determinations about Title 42.  I think, as it relates to the recent decision, I&#8217;d have to talk to the Department of Homeland Security specifically about that and how they&#8217;re applying it or implementing it. <br><br>As you know, our intention is certainly not to put more children at da- &#8212; in danger or put them &#8212; incentivize parents sending kids on a journey that&#8217;s treacherous and dangerous across the border.  <br><br>But the President &#8212; you know, he is implementing this because we are still in the middle of a public health crisis.  That continues to be the case, as <s>designed</s> [designated] by the CDC.<br><br>Q    But he still plans to reopen the border and make more humane policy, like he promised?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  That is &#8212; that is what he proposed on his first day in office.  And we are very supportive of the efforts in the Senate to do exactly that. <br><br>And just because it&#8217;s not done yet, it doesn&#8217;t mean that we aren&#8217;t going to stay at the fight to get exactly that accomplished and done.<br><br>Q    Jen, is there any reason why you have not condemned racism against Africans in Ukraine?  I understand that Ukrainians are the victims here; they are being bombed by Russia, and they are being killed.  But a lot of Africans, they are facing racism.  I know you are providing a lot of financial assistance to Poland and to Ukraine, but Africans there are being banned from even entering Poland.  Why have you not officially &#8212; the White House &#8212; issued a statement condemning racism against Africans in Ukraine?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  We have, and I believe the State Department has.  But we have spoken out against that and expressed concern about any reports of discrimination or &#8212; at the border.<br><br>Q    And then finally, if I may: I&#8217;m trying to understand where you&#8217;re trying &#8212; your endgame in Ukraine.  You&#8217;re not going there.  You&#8217;re not sending troops there.  There will be no fly &#8212; no no-fly zone over Ukraine.  And are you &#8212; will it be a fair assessment to say that you are pushing these guys to commit suicide, knowing that Russia has a superpower and, eventually, it will capture the main cities, Kyiv and Kharkiv, and other these cities around there?  What&#8217;s the endgame? <br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Well, the endgame is really a question for President Putin.  We have &#8212; we have completely crushed his economy.  We have provided military assistance, humanitarian assistance to the Ukrainians, enabling them to fight back for far longer than the Russian leadership anticipated. <br><br>And, again, he has to &#8212; he has to determine what the path forward looks for &#8212; like for him. <br><br>Thanks, everyone.<br><br>Q    Jen, can you confirm or deny the rumors that there are Russian hit squads in Kyiv going after journalists?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  I don’t have any details on that for you. <br><br>Q    But you’ve heard of it?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  I can see if there’s more.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Via Teleconference</p>



<p>2:59 P.M. EDT</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MODERATOR:&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Thanks, everyone, for joining us today.&nbsp; So, this call is on background.&nbsp; It is attributable to a “senior administration official.”&nbsp; And the contents of this call are embargoed until the end of the call.</p>



<p>For your reporting &#8212; sorry, for your awareness &#8212; oh, my God &#8212; for your awareness, not for your reporting, the speaker on this call is [senior administration official].</p>



<p>So, again, as a reminder, this call is on background to a “senior administration official.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>With that, I’ll turn it over to you for some top remarks.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Thanks so much.&nbsp; And thanks to everybody for hopping on.&nbsp; I&#8217;m sorry for keeping you all waiting just a little bit there.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So I think you all have seen the readout that went out from the White House just a little bit ago, so I won&#8217;t rehearse what was in there.&nbsp; You’ve got that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But, you know, we just wrapped a meeting in Rome, of course between the National Security Advisor and his PRC counterpart.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The two covered a range of issues of interest to the United States and the international community.&nbsp; It was an intense seven-hour session reflecting the gravity of the moment, as well as our commitment to maintaining open lines of communication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While this meeting had been planned for some time, it was a timely and important conversation in this crisis moment.&nbsp; The two officials covered the whole range of issues in the U.S.-China relationship.&nbsp; <a>They had an extensive conversation on Russia/Ukraine, with the National Security Advisor laying out where we are, how we got here, and what the risks are that we see lying ahead. </a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>The two sides discussed DPRK because that is also an escalating situation that demands our attention.&nbsp; We agreed that officials with responsibility for this issue from the two sides will deepen their conversations in the near future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, they discussed crisis management and ways to manage strategic risk, following up on the discussion in November between President Biden and President Xi on the importance of doing so, toward the goal of managing the competition between our two countries to ensure that it does not veer into conflict.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The National Security Advisor also reiterated our One China policy based on the Taiwan Relations Act, Three Communiqués, and Six Assurances.&nbsp; And he underscored concerns about Beijing&#8217;s courses and provocative actions across the Taiwan Strait.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This meeting, of course, comes not only amid Russia&#8217;s intensifying invasion in Ukraine, but also the intense work in recent months with our allies and partners in Europe and Asia.</p>



<p>The National Security Advisor described to Yang the unity of the United States and its allies and partners, the unprecedented coordination with our European and NATO Allies in particular, as well as the intense and unprecedented engagement by Asia Pacific allies in bringing the cost on Russia for its actions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The President, as you know, has been coordinating closely with our Indo-Pacific partners to support the solidarity.&nbsp; And, of course, just less than two weeks ago, President Biden convened a secure video meeting of the Quad leaders of Australia, India, Japan, and the United States to discuss the war against Ukraine and the implications for the Indo-Pacific.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So that is what I&#8217;ve got on the meeting, and we&#8217;d be happy to take a couple of questions.</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; Could we re-up the directions again to ask a question please?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Can you tell us: What is the current financial situation between China and Russia?&nbsp; And was this call &#8212; this meeting so urgent, particularly because of the threat that Russia &#8212; the possibility Russia might default as soon as Wednesday?&nbsp; And is Russia seeking a bailout from China?&nbsp; And is that your prime concern more than weapons right now &#8212; to stop China from bailing out Russia?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Well, thanks so much, Andrea, for the question.&nbsp; So let me just clarify with a bit of context that, you know, this meeting had been planned for some time.&nbsp; In fact, discussions about planning this meeting started soon after the virtual meeting between the two leaders, which, of course, that meeting was in November.&nbsp; I believe the planning conversations for this meeting today took place &#8212; started in December.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So this was the date that had been agreed upon by the U.S. and China quite some time ago.&nbsp; But, of course, the context in which the conversation is taking place has shifted since the original conversations about this meeting.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a>So I wouldn&#8217;t want to somehow convey that there was an urgency necessarily, or that this meeting was timed based on some particular events vis-à-vis Russia/Ukraine.&nbsp; Rather, again, this was a long-planned, long-discussed meeting where, in fact, the timing of it landed, we think, was a really timely and important moment in this crisis.&nbsp;</a></p>



<p>So that&#8217;s kind of on the timing piece of it.</p>



<p>You know, on the question about, you know, the financial situation and what our concerns are and whatnot: I mean, number one, I&#8217;d have to sort of refer you to Russia and China, respectively, about what the situation actually is.&nbsp; But, you know, what I would just say, in general, is that we do have deep concerns about China&#8217;s alignment with Russia at this time, and the National Security Advisor was direct about those concerns and the potential implications and consequences of certain actions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Can we do our next question, please?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, thanks so much for doing this.&nbsp; I just want to follow on Andrea’s question.&nbsp; Does the U.S. have information that China has expressed an openness to providing Russia with the requested military and financial assistance that we&#8217;ve all reported on?&nbsp; And has any assistance been provided from China to Russia since the invasion of Ukraine started?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Thanks, Kaitlan.&nbsp; I do not have any comments for you on that.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you say why you don’t have any comment?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; I &#8212;</p>



<p>OPERATOR:&nbsp; All right, our next ques- &#8212;</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; (Inaudible.)</p>



<p>OPERATOR:&nbsp; Sorry.</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Let’s let [senior administration official] finish that thought.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Well, I’m not going to comment on the specific reports.&nbsp; You know, what I will say, in general, in terms of concerns vis-à-vis what China may be considering, or what kind of support it could provide: You know, the National Security Advisor was clear, I think, over the weekend.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But we&#8217;re not communicating via the press with the PRC.&nbsp; We are communicating directly and privately with China about our concerns, about the kinds of support that other countries might be providing to Russia.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; Next question, please.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hello, thank you.&nbsp; You said it was an intense seven-hour meeting.&nbsp; Why was it so intense?&nbsp; Why was it so long?&nbsp; What did you ask China to do?&nbsp; Was it a successful meeting?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; That was a lot of &#8212; a lot packed in there, so I&#8217;ll try and hit all of those, Steve.</p>



<p>You know, why was it intense?&nbsp; I would say, number one, you know, this was pretty &#8212; this is a &#8212; there&#8217;s a lot of gravity in this moment<a></a><a>.&nbsp; And I think the conversation reflected the intensity of that.&nbsp; And I think it was also a very candid conversation, which I &#8212; you know, I think is also important.&nbsp;</a></p>



<p>Why was it so long?&nbsp; Well, you know, it had been planned as, you know, a relatively lengthy set of meetings &#8212; set of exchanges.&nbsp; We had several sessions throughout the day, including, you know, a one-on-one between the two officials, as they have done previously.&nbsp; And, you know, I think &#8212; I mean, there&#8217;s practical reasons there, which is, you know, the National Security Advisor and Director Yang flew great lengths to meet.&nbsp; So, important to take that opportunity to cover the wide range of issues, you know, not only in U.S.-China relations, but of, you know, international interest and import.&nbsp; So, I think that is the reason for the length.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You know, on the question of, you know, of a specific ask: You know, I would just say that this meeting was not about negotiating any specific issues or outcomes, but about a candid, direct exchange of views and articulation of those.&nbsp; And I would suppose it depends on how you define success.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But again, we believe that it is important to keep open lines of communication between the United States and China, especially on areas where we disagree.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s incredibly important to be able to have, you know, candid and direct conversations about those things.&nbsp; And so, I’m certain that that was what occurred today.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey, [senior administration official], thanks for doing this.&nbsp; I&#8217;m going to try to get you to say something on those reports on the assistance that Russia had requested from China.&nbsp; And I&#8217;ll try a different way.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a>When you guys say, you know, that there &#8212; that you&#8217;re looking for substantial and material support that could be provided, what do you define it as?&nbsp; Is there a red line that China could cross, but if they don&#8217;t, then there&#8217;s no consequences for them?&nbsp;</a></p>



<p>And then secondly, you know, this is a pretty high-stakes moment, as you’ve said &#8212; you know, also in the context of all of these reports.&nbsp; And I don&#8217;t know if your candid conversations necessarily always lead to the Chinese understanding exactly what you want from them.&nbsp; So, does it warrant a call between the leaders to follow up and really drive home the points you made today?</p>



<p>And then thirdly &#8212; sorry, because my line is still open &#8212; what did you take into this meeting from allies?&nbsp; And how concerned are they on these reports, on the intel that you shared with them?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Thanks, Jenny.&nbsp; Love the &#8212; the, like, triple, quadruple questions we&#8217;ve got going here.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not too jet-lagged yet to lose track.</p>



<p>So, on the first question &#8212; look, I&#8217;m just going to reiterate that we do have deep concerns about China&#8217;s alignment with Russia at this time.&nbsp; And the National Security Advisor was direct about those concerns and the potential implications and consequences of certain actions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But again, we&#8217;re not communicating via the press with China.&nbsp; We&#8217;re communicating directly and privately.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t have anything for you on the question about a call between the leaders, other than, again, we believe it&#8217;s important to maintain open lines of communication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I said I was going to remember your last question, and now I can&#8217;t read my handwriting here.&nbsp; So, what was the third one?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think it was concer- &#8212; are our allies and partners concerned about &#8212;</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, our allies.&nbsp; Right.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Of course, of course, of course.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Look, again, not going to be able to confirm any reports or comment on any new reports that have been in the press.&nbsp; However, as I noted, we have been, you know, working closely, consulting closely with allies and partners over &#8212; you know &#8212; well, over the course of the entire administration, but certainly very intensively in recent months.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You know &#8212; and I would refer you to other capitals to characterize their own views, other than to say that I know that, you know, the &#8212; much of the world is, you know, watching the decisions that various governments are taking in this incredibly important moment.</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; I think we have time for just one more question, so could we queue that up, please?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again this Hyeongjoo, VOA.&nbsp; Thank you for this opportunity.&nbsp; My question is about discussion on DPRK.&nbsp; So, could you be a little bit more specific on what Jake Sullivan’s message to his counterpart, especially, as you may know, the situation in Korean Peninsula is escalating by North Korea&#8217;s continuous provocation?</p>



<p>And also, we have a news report, citing South Korean officials, that North Korea intercontinental ballistic missiles launch might be imminent.&nbsp; So what did you ask China to do in dealing with the North Korea?&nbsp; Especially, did you discuss the Chinese continuous objection at the U.N. Security Council to respond the North Korean missile test?</p>



<p>And also, how would you respond if North Korea launched the intercontinental ballistic missile?&nbsp; How would you respond?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Thanks for that question. &nbsp;So, obviously &#8212; oh, there&#8217;s a bit of an echo.&nbsp; Okay, it’s better now.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You know, obviously &#8212; you know, we have serious concerns about the recent escalatory actions that we have seen from the DPRK.&nbsp; You know, the National Security Advisor was clear with Director Yang not only about those concerns, but also, you know, about the steps that we believe are necessary in this moment and the work that we hope to be able to engage with China on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We do think there is a history of the United States and China being able to work together on this issue, in addition to, obviously, the United States continuing our close work with our allies in Seoul and Tokyo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, you know, that&#8217;s where the two sides &#8212; the National Security Advisor and Director Yang &#8212; discussed ensuring that there are follow-up conversations in the near future, building on recent discussions between, you know, our Special Representative Sung Kim and his Chinese Special Representative Liu Xiaoming in order to further discuss specific ways that the United States and China may be able to press the DPRK on a different path.</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; Thanks, everyone.&nbsp; That was our last question.&nbsp; As a reminder, this call was on background, attributable to a “senior administration official.”&nbsp; The embargo on the contents of this call have now lifted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you have any more questions, please feel free to reach out to me and we&#8217;ll make sure to get back to you.&nbsp; Thanks, everyone.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Marriott Marquis<br>Washington, D.C.</p>



<p>2:31 P.M. EDT<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Hello, hello, hello.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; It’s great to be back with you all, in person this time.&nbsp; Please, sit down.&nbsp; Please, sit down &#8212; if you have a seat.&nbsp; (Laughs.)&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AUDIENCE MEMBER:&nbsp; We love you, Mr. Biden!<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Mr. President, Mayor Vince Williams, thank you for your leadership of this organization and your leadership down in Union City, Georgia.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>I wanted to come here because you’re the people America looks to first for guidance and for leadership.&nbsp; And that’s not hyperbole.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; City managers, mayors, councilpersons &#8212; when you have a problem, they’re knocking on your doors.&nbsp; That’s because their quality of life depends on you more than anyone else.&nbsp; And I’m not trying to be solicitous; I know from personal experience.</p>



<p>When I was a 27-year-old kid, I got elected to the New Castle County Council, which &#8212; we’re like a miniature Illinois; one county has 60 percent of the population of the state.&nbsp; And so the Councilman represents a district seven times bigger than the state rep and three times bigger than a state senator.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, fortunately, after two years &#8212; I was elected for four years &#8212; after two years, my &#8212; the Republican party saw in me something I didn’t see; they &#8212; so they reapportioned me to a two-year term &#8212; (laughter) &#8212; from a district that was overwhelmingly Republican to over overwhelmingly Republican.&nbsp; (Laughter.)</p>



<p>So I got put in the position &#8212; that old saying goes &#8212; “up or out.”&nbsp; So I do appreciate what you all do.&nbsp; I really mean it.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You’re &#8212; you’re there &#8212; you can’t walk into a grocery store or gas station, you can’t go into a supermarket without &#8212; without someone having a question for you, and &#8212; because you’re the &#8212; you’re the people they know, you’re the people they depend on.&nbsp; You’re out there every day on the frontlines of public service.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And that’s why, when I took office last year in the midst of the worst health pandemic in a century, the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, I knew we had to design a Rescue Plan with your partnership to meet your needs.</p>



<p>Three days ago marked the one-year anniversary I signed the American Rescue Plan.&nbsp; I’m &#8212; (applause) &#8212; I learned as a councilman I never have anything that’s intended to be shared by the cities and towns that has to go through state legislature.&nbsp; (Laughter and applause.)&nbsp; No, I mean it.</p>



<p>The most significant investment in local government in all of history was in that plan.&nbsp; And frankly, you couldn’t have gotten it done without your support and so many local officials around the country.</p>



<p>I don’t need to remind you the situation you all inherited in 2020 &#8212; the pain, the disruption, the stress of your local budgets requiring you to lay off cops, firefighters, teachers.&nbsp; So many people lost their jobs.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And you remember the lines of cars stretching for miles in your communities, with families just waiting for a box of food to be put in the backseat or the trunk.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because of this law, we were able to help 41 million Americans put food on the table for the better part of a year.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Because of this law, we helped keep a roof over 4 million people’s heads.&nbsp; And it gave what &#8212; families what my dad would call “just a little bit of breathing room” in a tough time.</p>



<p>And it worked.&nbsp; Because we took action, America added 6.7 million jobs last year &#8212; (applause) &#8212; more jobs created in one year than ever before in American history.&nbsp; And it hasn’t stopped.</p>



<p>We’re now well over 7 million jobs &#8212; 678,000 just last month.&nbsp; The unemployment rate is down to 3.8 percent.&nbsp; The economy grew at 5.7 percent last year &#8212; (applause) &#8212; the strongest growth in four decades.</p>



<p>A leading financial team on Wall Street, Moody’s, estimate that because of the Rescue Plan, 4 million more jobs were created and unemployment is lower by 2 percent than it would have been had we failed to act.</p>



<p>One year after signing this law, our cities, our towns, and our rural communities are roaring back.</p>



<p>Before this law, state and local governments were still down more than a million jobs from before the pandemic.</p>



<p>One year later, we had at least &nbsp;one year of state and local job growth &#8212; the largest in 20 years &#8212; adding 467,000 jobs.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Educators, firefighters, police officers back on the job.</p>



<p>Before this law, fewer than half our schools were open, putting an extraordinary strain on parents and teachers and students.&nbsp; One year later, more than 99 percent of our schools are open, and kids are back in the classroom.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>And, folks, you just had the strongest year of hiring teachers and educators on record.</p>



<p>But there’s more to the story than that.&nbsp; America has had many recoveries in the past.&nbsp; But underneath those recoveries there’s also been a lot of lasting pain.&nbsp; Lots of folks never get back on their feet when they’re knocked down so badly.&nbsp; And a whole lot of young people saw their futures dimmed from the previous recession.&nbsp; They never got back on their feet.</p>



<p>It’s what economists call “economic scarring”: chronic pain when the economy comes back but some folks are still left behind.&nbsp; Trapped in long-term unemployment.&nbsp; Eviction and foreclosure.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Research shows that when you’re stuck in that cycle, it has the worst impact on your emotional health than the loss of a family member &#8212; which sounds excessive, but it’s true.&nbsp; And it’s serious.</p>



<p>So when I came to office in the midst of this crisis, I was determined not to let that happen again.</p>



<p>This time around, with the American Rescue Plan, we made a choice to bring everyone along &#8212; every single person in America.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>So, not only has the unemployment rate dropped at a record pace, we’ve also seen the biggest drop in long-term unemployment ever recorded in a 12-month span; nearly 2.5 million people breaking out of that cycle of long-term unemployment and depression.</p>



<p>Black unemployment fell by more than 30 percent.&nbsp; Hispanic unemployment fell from nearly 9 percent to 4.4 percent, the fastest drop ever recorded.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>And we’ve seen &#8212; it was something we should be doing again, but I’m having trouble getting it passed again &#8212; and that is the Child Tax Credit.&nbsp; The lowest pov- &#8212; child poverty rate projected in 40 years &#8212; a 40-year decline.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>Folks, we also have the lowest number of home foreclosures ever recorded, a record low of credit card delinquencies because families had more money in their pockets.</p>



<p>The list goes on.&nbsp; But you all know it better than I do: A big part of the reason we’re so successful is because the Rescue Plan went directly to you without having to pass “Go,” without having to go to the statehouses.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>Folks, we allocated $350 billion to state and local budgets, but we made sure $130 billion of that went straight to local governments.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Straight to local government.</p>



<p>Six thousand local governments never got a dime of the earlier relief package exac- &#8212; enacted before I came to office.&nbsp; But we made sure that every one of you was dealt into the Rescue Plan.</p>



<p>As a former local official, I know that it matters &#8212; having that flexibility and control to meet both the short-term and the long-term challenges you face.</p>



<p>One year later, the Rescue Plan is still delivering.&nbsp; So I urge you all to use the flexibility we built into the law to spend these funds wisely: to reduce violence in your communities, like members are doing in Baton Rouge and Baltimore and in New York City; to address homelessness and affordable housing, like you’re doing in Tacoma and New York City; to expand high-speed Internet, like Brownsville, Texas; or to train people for good-paying jobs, like you’re doing in Oklahoma City.</p>



<p>And, by the way, there are a lot of jobs coming to people that you’re going to need to train up people, thanks to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill.</p>



<p>Everybody knew &#8212; and you heard from my Secretary a little bit earlier &#8212; America was falling behind on infrastructure.&nbsp; We used to be number one in the world; we’re now number eight.&nbsp; But now, not only has Infrastructure Week finally arrived, we’re talking about infrastructure decade, not week.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>And, folks, we’ve already authorized 4,000 projects all across the country, including 1,500 bridges in disrepair, and they’re starting this year, not later &#8212; this year.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>And the law is going to create millions of jobs rebuilding America’s roads, bridges, highways, ports, and airports; getting rid of poisonous lead pipes in 10 million homes and 400,000 schools so kids and families can have clean drinking water.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>And, folks, we’re investing $65 billion to deliver high-speed Internet everywhere in America: urban, rural, suburban, Tribal communities.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We can’t be a country where a mother has to take her kid to the McDonald’s parking lot to do their homework over the Internet.&nbsp; This is the United States of America, for God’s sake.</p>



<p>And, folks, the law is going to put an end to that, obviously.&nbsp; And the only &#8212; it’s only the beginning.&nbsp; Hundreds of billions of new investments are on the way.</p>



<p>Today, Secretary Buttigieg announced $409 million in new grants, 70 new projects, 39 states &#8212; just the beginning; electric buses to make bus service safer and more reliable and environmentally sound, helping folks in big cities, small towns get to work and get to school.</p>



<p>Projects like a new $15 million bus maintenance facility serving Atlanta; $5 million to buy cleaner and more reliable hydrogen fuel cells for buses, replacing old diesel engines in south &#8212; in southern Nevada, and so much more.</p>



<p>It’s now time for cities and towns to get ready.&nbsp; You don’t have to wait until these infrastructure projects start.&nbsp; You’re going to need more welders, pipefitters, advanced manufacturers.</p>



<p>And it takes training to get the job done well.&nbsp; And that’s why all these programs &#8212; these apprenticeship programs, union programs &#8212; and, by the way, when people talk about an apprenticeship program, we’re talking like going to four years of college; it’s four years.&nbsp; That’s why they’re the best workers in the world when they finish.&nbsp; Projects are cheaper because they last longer and they’re better.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can’t &#8212; you can start by investing in those Rescue Plan funds now, in new pathways to better jobs through union-based apprenticeships and on-the-job training.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Build the strong, diverse workforce you need to take on these infrastructure jobs so the families in your communities can deal themselves into this booming economy.</p>



<p>Look, we have an incredible opportunity ahead of us.&nbsp; But despite the progress we’ve made, we know that families are still struggling with higher prices.</p>



<p>I grew up in a family where when the price of gas went up at the pump &#8212; a gas station &#8212; we talked about it at the kitchen table.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But let’s be absolutely clear about why prices are high now.&nbsp; They’re high for two reasons. &nbsp;One was COVID.</p>



<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The way the global economy works: If a factory in Taiwan that makes computer chips shuts down due to a COVID outbreak, it causes a ripple effect to slow down auto manufacturing in Detroit &#8212; literally, not figuratively.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, because of the pandemic, we had significant dirupt- &#8212; disruptions in the supply chain.&nbsp; And our supply chain is so important with so many materials that come from other places.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the same time, because the Rescue Plan boosted the strength and speed of our recovery, Americans had more money in their pockets.</p>



<p>And during the pandemic, they wanted to spend that money not on restaurants and vacations &#8212; because of COVID &#8212; but on hard goods: home improvements, televisions, automobiles.</p>



<p>But the lumber factories weren’t open.&nbsp; They weren’t making two-by-fours.&nbsp; Plywood wasn’t available.&nbsp; I can go down the list.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The very products that we needed for the things they wanted to buy are slowed down by disruptions in the supply chain.</p>



<p>So what happens?&nbsp; Prices went up significantly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just look at automobiles.&nbsp; Last year, automobiles &#8212; new automobiles accounted for one third of all the inflation in America.&nbsp; Because the auto companies couldn’t get the computer chips, the price of an automobile skyrocketed.</p>



<p>And now, the second big reason for inflation is Vladimir Putin &#8212; and gas prices.&nbsp; Not a joke.&nbsp; We’ve seen the price of gas go up over a dollar just since he put his troops on the border &#8212; on the border of Ukraine.&nbsp; It went up a dollar and five cents.&nbsp; A big part of that reason is Putin began amassing troops along the border and then crossed.</p>



<p>And guess what?&nbsp; The world took notice.&nbsp; The market anticipated; prices went up.&nbsp; And then Putin invaded.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Make no mistake: The current spike in gas prices is largely the fault of Vladimir Putin.&nbsp; It has nothing to do with the American Rescue Plan.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Back to Wall Street: Wall Street estimated that the &#8212; and the San Francisco Reser- &#8212; Federal Reserve said &#8212; analyzed it &#8212; said the Rescue Plan contributed only 0.3 percent to inflation &#8212; 0.3 percent.&nbsp; That&#8217;s coming from the Fed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rescuing our economy didn&#8217;t cause this problem, but we’re working to fix it.&nbsp; We’re building this economy from the bottom up and the middle out.&nbsp; And something incredible is happening: We&#8217;re seeing a manufacturing revival like never before &#8212; the pride that comes from stamping products “Made in America.”</p>



<p>If they’d hold a minute &#8212; one of the things you should be aware of &#8212; there is a law I was unaware of when I was a senator, to be honest with you.&nbsp; It&#8217;s called “Made in America.”&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As President of the United States, I get to allocate over $600 billion in spending on federal projects.&nbsp; Any federal project, the President for &#8212; since 1939 has been able to say, “That entire product has to be made in America before I&#8217;m going to pay for it.”&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, guess what?&nbsp; Fifty-three perc- &#8212; if it was 55 percent of the product was made in America, it was thought to be made in America.&nbsp; I&#8217;m changing that.&nbsp; I&#8217;m changing that.&nbsp; It has to be a minimum of 75 percent and then &#8212; (applause) &#8212; and then &#8212; because where in the hell is it written saying we can&#8217;t manufacture things in America again?&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know where that&#8217;s written.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>And so, guess what?&nbsp; Intel came to me.&nbsp;</p>



<p>AUDIENCE MEMBER:&nbsp; Yeah!</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; They&#8217;re going in- &#8212; yes.&nbsp; By the way, yes. &nbsp;The chairman of the board came.&nbsp; They&#8217;re going to invest $20 billion to build a factory in Ohio to manufacture computer chips &#8212; (applause); semiconductors that will power the world and our everyday lives &#8212; smartphones, the Internet, technology that doesn&#8217;t even exist today.&nbsp; And they&#8217;re prepared to increase that investment from $20 billion to $100 billion in the suburb of Cleveland.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>So now it’ll create over 12,000 jobs &#8212; some of them just building the facilities, but the rest &#8212; blue-collar workers making an average of $135,000 a year in these factories.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>And as soon as the Congress sends me the Bipartisan Innovation Bill &#8212; a bill that will invest another $52 billion in computer chips &#8212; I might add, by the way, we invented the computer chip here in America.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; We advanced the computer chip here in America.&nbsp; Then we stopped making the computer chip here in America.&nbsp; And that’s going to bring down prices of automobiles, appliances, and so much more.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s not just Intel; look at Ford.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I had a long discussion with Ford and General Motors and the Detroit factories.&nbsp; Ford has committed $11 billion to build electric vehicles in America &#8212; the biggest investment they&#8217;ve ever made.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>GM has committed $7 billion to build electric vehicles.&nbsp; Just a few years ago, these pompl- &#8212; these companies might have built these factories elsewhere; not now.&nbsp; They&#8217;re building it right here in the United States of America again.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>But look, we also know there&#8217;s much more than one way to increase people&#8217;s standard of living.&nbsp; You can reduce the cost.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Look, right now, what &#8212; what&#8217;s the problem?&nbsp; Again, my dad used to say, “People just need a little bit of breathing room.”&nbsp; My dad was a &#8212; a &#8212; not &#8212; my dad was just a wonderful, decent gentleman whose greatest regret was he never went to college.&nbsp;</p>



<p>My dad &#8212; my dad used to talk about how middle-class folks, whenever given a chance, they&#8217;d never, ever, ever let the country down.&nbsp; Never let the country down.&nbsp; When they do well, everybody does well.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>But look &#8212; so, gasoline prices, home heating oil prices are going to continue to go up because of these &#8212; these embargoes on Russian oil and other things that he&#8217;s brought on.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But what happened?&nbsp; There&#8217;s other ways &#8212; they used &#8212; my dad used to talk about the standard of living.&nbsp; It costs a lot more money if you have to pay five bucks at a pump for a gallon of gasoline, and that affects families big time &#8212; or to heat your home.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But guess what?&nbsp; If you lower the cost of childcare, it affects your standard of living.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s why we&#8217;re going to make sure no one has to pay more than 7 percent of their income on childcare.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are over 200,000 kids in America and many more adults with Type 1 diabetes<a> needing insulin every day.&nbsp; It costs 10 bucks to make a vial of insulin.&nbsp; The average cost: $647 a month, up to $1,000.&nbsp; Not going to happen on my watch.&nbsp; No one is going to be able to charge more than $35 a month for insulin.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; They’ll still make a big profit.</a></p>



<p>The average family, when we passed the provision allowing for tax credit for homeowners to winterize their homes, can save an average of 500 bucks a month just by having doors that don’t leak, windows that don’t leak, and so on.</p>



<p>So, look, let me be clear: None of this will increase inflation.&nbsp; Seventeen Nobel Prize winners in economics wrote to me saying it would ease inflationary presence &#8212; pressures.</p>



<p>We can also do it without raising a single penny on tax of anybody making under $400,000 a year.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; If you make less than 400, you’re not going to pay a penny in tax.&nbsp; We have to do this by asking the top and the biggest corporations to pay a little more.</p>



<p>Look, I’m a capitalist.&nbsp; If you can a million or a billion bucks, good for you.&nbsp; But pay your fair share!&nbsp; Pay a little bit.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>By the way, whether you’re Democrats or Republicans, raise your hand if you think the tax structure is fair now.</p>



<p>Look, 55 &#8212; I come from the corporate capital of the world.</p>



<p>AUDIENCE MEMBER:&nbsp; Delaware!</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; You got it.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Well, you think I’m kidding.&nbsp; There are more corporations incorporated in Delaware than every other state in the union combined.</p>



<p>And I got elected seven times in Delaware, notwithstanding the fact that I’m so “anti-corporate America.” &nbsp;Give me a break.&nbsp; How long would I last if &#8212;</p>



<p>But here’s the deal: Fifty-five of the largest corporations of Fortune 500 paid zero in federal taxes last year, and they made $40 billion in profits.&nbsp;</p>



<p>AUDIENCE:&nbsp; Booo &#8212;</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Look, I said, “I’m a capitalist.&nbsp; That’s not about punishing anybody.”&nbsp; But why in God’s name should a billion-dollar corporation pay a lower tax rate than a teacher or a firefighter?&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>So, folks &#8212; I really mean it.&nbsp; We could raise the standard of living for hardworking families without raising tax, without raising inflation, without raising the deficit.</p>



<p>And let me remind everybody: I actually, last year, cut the budget $360 billion &#8212; cutting the budget.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>And we’re on track now to be the first President in history to have a lower deficit by over $1 trillion in one year.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>Look, folks, we can tackle these challenges, but we can’t do it without you.&nbsp; You understand what families are up against every time you walk down the street in your neighborhoods.&nbsp; You understand the cost if we fail to act.</p>



<p>We need your voices &#8212; the voices of local officials who understand what your communities need.&nbsp; Your senators and congressperson will listen to you all.</p>



<p>If you can get this done &#8212; we can get it done, there’s no limit to what America can achieve.</p>



<p>So let’s give working people the quality they deserve &#8212; the quality of life.&nbsp; Let’s face the challenge ahead and let’s keep building a better America.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>We can do this!&nbsp; Thank you for taking the time.&nbsp; Love you all.&nbsp; Keep at it.&nbsp; Thank you, thank you, thank you.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>Thanks, everybody.&nbsp; I really mean it.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Every time I’d walk out of my grandpop’s house up in Scranton, Pennsylvania &#8212; his name was Ambrose Finnegan &#8212; he’d yell, “Joey, keep the faith.”&nbsp; And my grandmother would yell, “No, Joey, spread it.”</p>



<p>Go spread the faith.&nbsp; Let’s get it done.&nbsp; Thank you. &nbsp;(Applause.)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>Equal pay is a matter of justice, fairness, and dignity &#8212; it is about living up to our values and who we are as a Nation.&nbsp; For over 25 years, Equal Pay Day has helped draw attention to gender-based pay disparities by highlighting how far into a new year a woman must work, on average, to earn what a man did in the previous year.</p>



<p>This year, Equal Pay Day falls on March 15, the earliest we have ever marked the occasion.  The earlier that Equal Pay Day arrives, the closer our Nation has come to achieving pay fairness.  But while we should celebrate the progress we have made, as I have said in the past, we should not be satisfied until Equal Pay Day is no longer necessary at all.</p>



<p>In 2020, the average woman working full-time, year-round, for wages or a salary earned 83 cents for every dollar paid to their average male counterpart.  And once again, the disparities are even greater for Black, Native American, Latina, and certain subpopulations of Asian women when compared to white men.  Disabled women also continue to experience significant disparities and make 80 cents for every dollar compared to men with disabilities.  The pay gap reflects outright discrimination as well as barriers that women face in accessing good-paying jobs and meeting caregiving responsibilities &#8212; including a lack of affordable child care, paid family and medical leave, and fair and predictable scheduling &#8212; which often prevent women from joining and staying in the workforce.</p>



<p> Over the course of a career, the pay gap can add up to hundreds of thousands of dollars in lost earnings, particularly for women of color, significantly impacting retirement savings and uniquely burdening households led by single mothers.</p>



<p> The Biden-Harris Administration has moved quickly to deliver results for women and working families and to dismantle the barriers that women face in the workplace.  In our first full year in office, we saw the largest calendar year decline in unemployment.  We also saw the strongest economic growth in nearly 4 decades, rising wages, and an estimated nearly 40 percent decline in child poverty.  We have turned the tide on women&#8217;s labor force participation, which the COVID-19 pandemic had pushed to a more than 30-year low.  In addition, my Administration has taken key steps to address pay discrimination, including issuing an Executive Order directing the Office of Personnel Management to take appropriate steps to advance equal pay at Federal agencies.  And I have raised the minimum wage for Federal contractors, which has significantly benefitted women &#8212; especially women of color &#8212; who are disproportionately represented in minimum-wage and low-wage jobs.</p>



<p>We can be proud of that progress &#8212; but there is more we need to do.  My Administration is fighting to ensure that women have the free and fair choice to organize and collectively bargain for the wages and benefits they deserve and to access training for good-paying jobs in sectors where they have historically been underrepresented.  We are working to eliminate anticompetitive barriers that keep women from bargaining for better pay and demanding dignity and respect in the workplace.  I have continued to call on the Congress to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act, which would help mitigate sex-based pay discrimination while ensuring greater transparency and reporting of disparities in wages.  And I am continuing to work with the Congress to pass critical legislation that would lower the cost of child care, elder care, home-based health care, and other major barriers to working families, while raising compensation for care workers, who are disproportionately women of color and who have been underpaid and undervalued for far too long.</p>



<p>If we are going to continue our record-breaking recovery and build a truly strong and competitive economy for the future, we have to address the barriers that have long held women back from full participation and fair treatment in the workforce.  The founding promise of our Nation is that all people are created equal &#8212; and my Administration is committed to ensuring that all Americans have a fair and equal opportunity to get ahead, so that one day soon we can render Equal Pay Day a relic of the past.</p>



<p>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 15, 2022, as National Equal Pay Day.  I call upon all Americans to recognize the full value of women&#8217;s skills and their significant contributions to the labor force, acknowledge the injustice of wage inequality, and join efforts to achieve equal pay.</p>



<p>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourteenth day of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-sixth.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-right">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.</p>
