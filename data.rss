<p>Today, President Biden signed an Executive Order (E.O.) to respond to President Putin’s action to purportedly recognize the so-called Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics (DNR and LNR) as “independent” states. President Putin’s action contradicts Russia’s commitments under the Minsk agreements, refutes Russia’s claimed commitment to diplomacy, and undermines Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.</p>



<p>This E.O. is distinct from the swift and severe economic measures we are prepared to issue with Allies and partners in response to a further Russian invasion of Ukraine. We are continuing to closely consult with Ukraine and with Allies and partners on next steps and urge Russia to immediately deescalate.</p>



<p><strong>Today’s E.O. prohibits:</strong></p>



<ul><li>New investment in the so-called DNR or LNR regions of Ukraine by a United States person, wherever located;</li><li>The importation into the United States, directly or indirectly, of any goods, services, or technology from the so-called DNR or LNR regions of Ukraine;</li><li>The exportation, reexportation, sale, or supply, directly or indirectly, from the United States, or by a United States person, wherever located, of any goods, services, or technology to the so-called DNR or LNR regions of Ukraine;</li><li>And any approval, financing, facilitation, or guarantee by a United States person, wherever located, of a transaction by a foreign person where the transaction by that foreign person would be covered by these prohibitions if performed by a United States person or within the United States.</li></ul>



<p><strong>The E.O. also provides authority to impose sanctions on persons determined:</strong></p>



<ul><li>To operate or have operated since the date of the order in the so-called DNR or LNR regions of Ukraine;</li><li>To be or have been since the date of the order a leader, official, senior executive officer, or member of the board of directors of an entity operating in the so-called DNR or LNR regions of Ukraine;</li><li>To be owned or controlled by, or to have acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order;</li><li>Or to have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of, any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order.</li></ul>



<p><strong>The Department of the Treasury is issuing six General Licenses to ensure that humanitarian and other related activity can continue in these regions:</strong></p>



<ul><li>The purpose of this E.O. is to deny Russia the chance to profit from its blatant violations of international law. These actions are not directed at the people of Ukraine or the Ukrainian government.</li><li>Treasury’s General Licenses are designed to support the innocent people who live in the so-called DNR and LNR regions who did not have a choice in Russia’s destabilizing and illegitimate actions today.</li><li>The licenses allow a short-term wind down of activities, as well as for the export to the regions of food, medicine and medical devices, and ensure personal remittances can continue to flow.</li><li>The licenses also allow telecommunications and internet services to remain operational, and mail services to continue.</li><li>The licenses allow international organizations to be able to provide aid to the people in these two regions.</li></ul>



<p>The United States will not hesitate to use its authorities to target those supporting efforts to undermine Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. This authority provides the United States with the flexibility to impose similar restrictions on any other regions of Ukraine as appropriate.</p>

<p>Dear Madam Speaker: (Dear Madam President:)</p>



<p>Pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50&nbsp;U.S.C. 1701 <em>et&nbsp;seq.</em>), I hereby report that I have issued an Executive Order (the &#8220;order&#8221;) that expands the scope of the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13660 of&nbsp;March 6, 2014, and expanded by Executive Order 13661 of March&nbsp;16, 2014, and Executive Order 13662 of March 20, 2014, and&nbsp;relied on for additional steps taken in Executive Order 13685 of December 19, 2014, and Executive Order 13849 of September 20, 2018, by finding that the Russian Federation&#8217;s purported recognition of the so-called Donetsk People&#8217;s Republic (DNR) or Luhansk People&#8217;s Republic (LNR) regions of Ukraine constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.</p>



<p>In order to deal with this threat, I am prohibiting new investment in the so-called DNR or LNR regions of Ukraine or such other regions of Ukraine as may be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State (&#8220;Covered Regions&#8221;), by a United States person, wherever located; the importation into the United States, directly or indirectly, of any goods, services, or technology from the Covered Regions; the exportation, reexportation, sale, or supply, directly or indirectly, from the United States, or by a United States person, wherever located, of any goods, services, or technology to the Covered Regions; and any approval, financing, facilitation, or guarantee by a United States person, wherever located, of a transaction by a foreign person where the transaction by that foreign person would be prohibited by the order if performed by a United States person or within the United States.</p>



<p>I am also creating the authority to impose sanctions on persons determined to operate or have operated since the date of the order in the Covered Regions; to be or have been since the date of the order a leader, official, senior executive officer, or member of the board of directors of an entity operating in the Covered Region; to be owned or controlled by, or to have acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to the order; or to have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of, any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to the order.</p>



<p>I am enclosing a copy of the order I have issued.</p>

<p>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50&nbsp;U.S.C. 1701 <em>et seq</em>.) (IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act&nbsp;(50 U.S.C. 1601 <em>et seq</em>.) (NEA), section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (8 U.S.C. 1182(f)), and&nbsp;section 301 of title 3, United States Code,<br><br>I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, hereby expand the scope of the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13660 of March 6, 2014, and expanded by Executive Order 13661 of March 16, 2014, and Executive Order 13662 of March 20, 2014, and relied on for additional steps taken in Executive Order 13685 of December 19, 2014, and Executive Order 13849 of September 20, 2018, finding that the Russian Federation&#8217;s purported recognition of the so-called Donetsk People&#8217;s Republic (DNR) or Luhansk People&#8217;s Republic (LNR) regions of Ukraine contradicts Russia&#8217;s commitments under the Minsk agreements and further threatens the peace, stability, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of Ukraine, and thereby constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. &nbsp;Accordingly, I hereby order:<br><br>Section 1. &nbsp;(a) &nbsp;The following are prohibited:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; new investment in the so-called DNR or LNR regions of Ukraine or such other regions of Ukraine as may be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State (collectively, the &#8220;Covered Regions&#8221;), by a&nbsp;United&nbsp;States person, wherever located;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii) &nbsp;&nbsp;the importation into the United States, directly or indirectly, of any goods, services, or&nbsp;technology from the&nbsp;Covered Regions;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iii) &nbsp;the exportation, reexportation, sale, or supply, directly or indirectly, from the United States, or by a United States person, wherever located, of any goods, services, or technology to&nbsp;the&nbsp;Covered Regions; and<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iv) &nbsp;&nbsp;any approval, financing, facilitation, or guarantee by a United States person, wherever located, of a transaction by a foreign person where the transaction by that foreign person would be prohibited by this section if performed by a United States person or within the United States.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) &nbsp;The prohibitions in subsection (a) of this section apply except to the extent provided by statutes, or in regulations, orders, directives, or licenses that may be issued pursuant to this order, and notwithstanding any contract entered into or license or permit granted prior to the date of this order.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Sec. 2. &nbsp;(a) &nbsp;All property and interests in property that are in the United States, that hereafter come within the United States, or that are or hereafter come within the possession or control of any United States person (including any foreign branch) of the following persons are blocked and may not be transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or otherwise dealt in: any person determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;to operate or have operated since the date of this order in the Covered Regions;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii)&nbsp; &nbsp;to be or have been since the date of this order a leader, official, senior executive officer, or member of the board of directors of an entity operating in the Covered Regions;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iii) &nbsp;to be owned or controlled by, or to have acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order; or<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iv)&nbsp; &nbsp;to have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of, any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) &nbsp;The prohibitions in subsection (a) of this section apply except to the extent provided by statutes, or in regulations, orders, directives, or licenses that may be issued pursuant to this order, and notwithstanding any contract entered into or any license or permit granted prior to the date of this order.<br><br>Sec. 3.&nbsp; The prohibitions in section 2 of this order include but are not limited to:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a) &nbsp;the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order; and<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) &nbsp;the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person.<br><br>Sec. 4.&nbsp; (a) &nbsp;Any transaction that evades or avoids, has the purpose of evading or avoiding, causes a violation of, or attempts to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) &nbsp;Any conspiracy formed to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited.<br><br>Sec. 5.&nbsp; Nothing in this order shall prohibit transactions for the conduct of the official business of the Federal Government by employees, grantees, or contractors thereof.<br><br>Sec. 6. &nbsp;(a) &nbsp;The unrestricted immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the United States of noncitizens determined to meet one or more of the criteria in section 2 of this order would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and the entry of such persons into the United States, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, is hereby suspended, except where the Secretary of State or the Secretary of Homeland Security, as appropriate, determines that the person&#8217;s entry would not be contrary to the interests of the United States, including when the Secretary of State or the Secretary of Homeland Security, as appropriate, so determines, based on a recommendation of the Attorney General, that the person&#8217;s entry would further important United States law enforcement objectives.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) &nbsp;The Secretary of State shall implement this authority as it applies to visas pursuant to such procedures as the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, may establish.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c) &nbsp;The Secretary of Homeland Security shall implement this order as it applies to the entry of noncitizens pursuant to such procedures as the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State, may establish.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (d) &nbsp;Such persons shall be treated by this section in the same manner as persons covered by section 1 of Proclamation 8693 of July 24, 2011 (Suspension of Entry of Aliens Subject to United Nations Security Council Travel Bans and International Emergency Economic Powers Act Sanctions).<br><br>Sec. 7. &nbsp;I hereby determine that the making of donations of the types of articles specified in section 203(b)(2) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)(2)) by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order would seriously impair my ability to deal with the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13660, expanded in Executive Orders 13661 and 13662, and further expanded by this order, and I hereby prohibit such donations as provided by section 2 of this order.<br><br>Sec. 8. &nbsp;For the purposes of this order:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a) &nbsp;the term &#8220;entity&#8221; means a partnership, association, trust, joint venture, corporation, group, subgroup, or other organization;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(b) &nbsp;the term &#8220;person&#8221; means an individual or entity;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(c) &nbsp;the term &#8220;United States person&#8221; means any United States citizen, lawful permanent resident, entity organized under the laws of the United States or any jurisdiction within the United States (including foreign branches), or any person in the United States;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(d) &nbsp;the term &#8220;noncitizen&#8221; means any person who is not a citizen or noncitizen national of the United States; and<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(e) &nbsp;the term &#8220;region of Ukraine&#8221; includes the land territory in that region as well as any maritime area over which sovereignty, sovereign rights, or jurisdiction is claimed based on purported sovereignty over that land territory or area.<br><br>Sec. 9<strong>.</strong> &nbsp;For those persons whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order who might have a constitutional presence in the United States, I find that because of the ability to transfer funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of measures to be&nbsp;taken pursuant to this order would render those measures ineffectual. &nbsp;I therefore determine that for these measures to be effective in addressing the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13660, expanded in Executive Orders 13661 and 13662, and further expanded by this order, there need be no prior notice of a listing or determination made pursuant to section 2 of this order.<br><br>Sec. 10<strong>.</strong>&nbsp; The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to take such actions, including the promulgation of rules and regulations, and to employ all powers granted to the President by IEEPA, as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this order. &nbsp;The Secretary of the Treasury may, consistent with applicable law, redelegate any of these functions within the Department of the Treasury. &nbsp;All executive departments and agencies of the United States shall take all appropriate measures within their authority to implement this order.<br><br>Sec. 11.&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) &nbsp;Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i) &nbsp;&nbsp;the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii) &nbsp;the functions of the Director of the Office of&nbsp;Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) &nbsp;This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c) &nbsp;This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.<br>&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.</p>

<p>President Joseph R.

<p>We have anticipated a move like this from Russia and are ready to respond immediately. President Biden will soon issue an Executive Order that will prohibit new investment, trade, and financing by U.S. persons to, from, or in the so-called DNR and LNR regions of Ukraine. This E.O. will also provide authority to impose sanctions on any person determined to operate in those areas of Ukraine. The Departments of State and Treasury will have additional details shortly. We will also soon announce additional measures related to today’s blatant violation of Russia’s international commitments.</p>



<p>To be clear: these measures are separate from and would be in addition to the swift and severe economic measures we have been preparing in coordination with Allies and partners should Russia further invade Ukraine.</p>



<p>We are continuing to closely consult with Allies and partners, including Ukraine, on next steps and on Russia’s ongoing escalation along the border with Ukraine.</p>

<p>As the President has repeatedly made clear, we are committed to pursuing diplomacy until the moment an invasion begins. Secretary Blinken and Foreign Minister Lavrov are scheduled to meet later this week in Europe, provided Russia does not proceed with military action. President Biden accepted in principle a meeting with President Putin following that engagement, again, if an invasion hasn’t happened.  We are always ready for diplomacy.  We are also ready to impose swift and severe consequences should Russia instead choose war.  And currently, Russia appears to be continuing preparations for a full-scale assault on Ukraine very soon. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>The Westin Grand Munich<br>Munich, Germany</em></p>



<p>11:18 A.M. CEST</p>



<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Well, this was an important trip to be here at the Munich Security Conference &#8212; in particular this year, as I said yesterday.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We are looking at a moment that is a very decisive moment on one of the bases for the Munich Security Conference and certainly one of the founding reasons for NATO, which is European security and the connection and alliance between Europe and the United States.</p>



<p>This was a productive trip, in terms of the extensive bilateral meetings that we had that were in furtherance of the ongoing collaboration and partnership with our Allies. &nbsp;</p>



<p>It was important in that, as you all know, this is a moment that is very dynamic.&nbsp; If not every hour, certainly every day, there seem to be new moments of interest and also of intelligence.&nbsp;<br><br>And so we have affirmed, however &#8212; all of that being said &#8212; through these last couple of days, that this Alliance is strong &#8212; probably stronger than it was before; and &#8212; and that this Alliance has purpose and meaning founded on shared principles that are very much at play right now.&nbsp; And as I mentioned yesterday, if we think about those principles, one of the most important is about a mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, which at its essence is what is at play in terms of Russia&#8217;s posture as it relates to Ukraine.<br><br>At stake is the NATO Alliance, in terms of our unity, joining together &#8212; through, sometimes, compromise; certainly always through collaboration &#8212; to be a unified voice, especially when these very founding principles of our relationship are being compromised, if not attacked.</p>



<p>So, with that, I’ll take any questions you have.</p>



<p>AIDE:&nbsp; And I’ll call on folks.&nbsp; So, Nandita from Reuters.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Madam Vice President.&nbsp; During your meeting with President Zelenskyy, he spoke a little bit about asking the U.S. for specific defense aid.&nbsp; Could you talk a little bit about what he asked the United States for and what the U.S. has agreed to offer?</p>



<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; Well, I&#8217;ll tell you what I think you already know: So far, we have offered &#8212; not even offered, we have &#8212; we have transferred and given $650 million in aid.&nbsp; We have also made certain loan guarantees around, in particular, $1 billion.<br><br>And that is on top of all of the work that we have done collectively through the NATO Alliance to provide support for Ukraine.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there anything new that you are planning to offer Ukraine?</p>



<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Well, what I made clear in our meeting and &#8212; is that &#8212; again, this is a dynamic situation.&nbsp; And depending on what happens in the coming days, we will reevaluate the need that Ukraine has and our ability to support.&nbsp; And we have been doing that through the course of these many months.</p>



<p>AIDE:&nbsp; Let&#8217;s go to Molly from ABC.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Madam Vice President.&nbsp; I wanted to ask you, first, are you going to take part in that NSC meeting &#8212;</p>



<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Yes.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; today?</p>



<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Yes.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You are going to take part in that?</p>



<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Yes.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then I wanted to follow up on your meeting with President Zelenskyy yesterday.&nbsp;</p>



<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Okay.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he spoke after your meeting, he shared his frustration with countries like the U.S. who say that a attack is likely to happen in Ukraine but that you won&#8217;t put sanctions in place until that happens.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You &#8212; the administration has continually said that retaining those sanctions holds on to some leverage.&nbsp; But if you believe Putin has made up his mind, what leverage do you really have?&nbsp; Why not put those sanctions in place now?<br><br>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; The purpose of the sanctions has always been and continues to be deterrence.&nbsp; But let&#8217;s also recognize the unique nature of the sanctions that we have outlined.</p>



<p>These are some of the greatest sanctions, if not the strongest, that we&#8217;ve ever issued.&nbsp; As I articulated yesterday, it is directed at institutions &#8212; in particular, financial institutions &#8212; and individuals, and it will exact absolute harm for the Russian economy and their government.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But if Putin has made up his mind, do you feel that this threat that has been looming is really going to deter him?<br><br>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Absolut- &#8212; we strongly believe &#8212; and remember also that the sanctions are a product not only of our perspective as the United States but a shared perspective among our Allies.&nbsp; And the Allied relationship is such that we have agreed that the deterrence effect of these sanctions is still a meaningful one, especially because &#8212; remember, also &#8212; we still sincerely hope that there is a diplomatic path out of this moment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And within the context then of the fact that that window is still opening, altho- &#8212; open, although it is absolutely narrowing &#8212; but within the context of a diplomatic path still being open, the deterrence effect, we believe, has merit.</p>



<p>AIDE:&nbsp; Let&#8217;s go to Jennifer Jacobs from Bloomberg.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Would you be willing to talk a little bit about how the U.S. would get out of this potential conflict with Russia?&nbsp; What is the endgame?&nbsp; How does the U.S. &#8212; after imposing some of these sanctions and possible military action, how does the U.S. disentangle from this?<br><br>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; I would characterize it differently.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t &#8212; we don&#8217;t consider ourselves to be entangled.&nbsp; But we&#8217;re very clear of our principles and our purpose, which is to be aligned with our Allies, understanding that &#8212; I mean, listen, guys, we&#8217;re talking about the potential for war in Europe.<br><br>I mean, let&#8217;s really take a moment to understand the significance of what we&#8217;re talking about.&nbsp; It’s been over 70 years.&nbsp; And through those 70 years, as I mentioned yesterday, there has been peace and security.&nbsp; We are talking about the real possibility of war in Europe.<br><br>So our position is, for us, very clear, which is as a leader &#8212; which we have been, bringing together the Allies, working together around our collective and unified position &#8212; that we would all not just prefer, we desire, we believe it is in the best interest of all that there is a diplomatic end to this moment.&nbsp; And so where do we want this to end?&nbsp; That is where we want it to end.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What should Americans be braced for?&nbsp; What could they possibly be facing?&nbsp; The President has already said Americans will be facing some economic fallout or some hardships.&nbsp; Can you explain to Americans what exactly will they face if this happened?</p>



<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; As the President talked about in his speech, we are aware that, again, when America stands for her principles and all of the things that we hold dear, it requires sometimes for us to put ourselves out there in a way that maybe we will incur some cost.&nbsp; And in this situation, that may relate to energy costs, for example.&nbsp; But we are taking very specific and appropriate, I believe, steps to mitigate what that cost might be if it happens.</p>



<p>AIDE:&nbsp; Let’s go to Eli at the Los Angeles Times.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Madam Vice President.&nbsp; A question about something else that President Zelenskyy said yesterday relating to NATO.&nbsp; He seemed to question the sincerity of Allies, including the U.S., I think, in terms of a desire to admit Ukraine to NATO.&nbsp; Is there any &#8212; is there any reaction to those pretty pointed comments from the President?&nbsp; And was that something that was discussed with Chancellor Scholz and other leaders?<br><br>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Let me start by saying I appreciate and admire President Zelenskyy’s desire to join NATO.&nbsp; And one of, again, the founding principles of NATO is that each country must have the ability &#8212; unimpaired, unimpeded &#8212; to determine their own future, both in terms of their form of government and, in this case, whether they desire to be a member of NATO.<br><br>And I&#8217;ll put that in context, because the obvious is also the point, which is that: and therefore no other country can tell anyone whether they should or should not join NATO.&nbsp; That should be their independent choice.&nbsp; That is the point of sovereignty.&nbsp; So I respect President Zelenskyy’s desire to be a member of NATO.&nbsp;</p>



<p>NATO is a membership.&nbsp; It is about nations coming together as a group, making decisions collectively around, again, principles and what will be, then, the conditions and &#8212; and the standards of membership.&nbsp; And so that is the process.</p>



<p>It doesn&#8217;t happen overnight.  No one country can say “I want to be, and therefore I will be.”  And no one country can say &#8220;You can&#8217;t be.&#8221;  And isn&#8217;t that at the heart of the very issue we’re presented with in terms of Russia&#8217;s aggression, or stated aggression, toward Ukraine?</p>



<p>Q    Was it surprising to you, though, that he planted that flag so firmly on that issue &#8212; given that that&#8217;s obviously Putin&#8217;s main demand, is that he gets some sort of guarantee, swearing that Ukraine won&#8217;t be admitted &#8212; that Zelenskyy wants to make it clear that they do want to enter the organization?  Was that a surprise that he would come and say that at this point in this crisis?  And does that make it less likely that there&#8217;ll be some sort of diplomatic resolution?<br><br>THE VICE PRESIDENT:  I&#8217;m not going to second guess President Zelenskyy’s desires for his own country.  But I will say this: Let us recognize the position he is in right now.  His country is virtually surrounded by Russian troops.  I believe he came here &#8212; this is my belief, based on just my own assessment and speculation &#8212; he came here to make a very clear point that he does not stand alone.<br></p>



<p>In fact, I told him in our meeting, “The United States stands with you.”  Because we do, as do this community of Allies and partners.</p>



<p>So I understand where he &#8212; why he came here.  And I would not second guess &#8212; I will not second guess why he spoke the words he speaks.<br></p>



<p>He&#8217;s in a position, again, where his country is virtually surrounded by what &#8212; by, I think most reasonable people would believe, hostile troops.<br></p>



<p>AIDE:  Let’s go to Aamer at The AP, please.</p>



<p>Q    Thank you, Madam Vice President.  So Daleep Singh said late last week that SWIFT sanctions probably won&#8217;t be part of the opening gambit if sanctions go forward.  Considering the administration saying early and often that you&#8217;re going to stay high &#8212; start high and stay high, how does that square?  How can you start high and stay high without SWIFT sanctions in the package?<br><br>THE VICE PRESIDENT:  We&#8217;re going to take this one moment at a time in terms of what might need to happen in the future in terms of escalation.  But right now, we&#8217;ve made our position clear.</p>



<p>AIDE:&nbsp; And last question, let&#8217;s go to Natasha at CNN.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Madam Vice President.&nbsp; I&#8217;m wondering whether the U.S. has evidence that Putin has actually given the order to his subordinates to launch an attack and whether that intelligence and that evidence is shared and agreed upon by the Allies here &#8212; and that includes Zelenskyy, who has been skeptical of this kind of intelligence in the past.</p>



<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; As the President has said, we believe that Putin has made his decision.&nbsp; Period.&nbsp; And &#8212; but I will also say that, as part of our relationship and partnership, in &#8212; in the context of the Alliance, we do share information, certainly, because we want to make sure that we are all working with the same information when we make these very critical and meaningful decisions &#8212; the last question about sanctions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I said it yesterday on the stage: Everybody didn&#8217;t agree at the beginning about what the consequences should be if Russia re-invades Ukraine.&nbsp; We had to meet.&nbsp; We had to discuss it.&nbsp; Because each of these nations &#8212; I mean, I spe- &#8212; I spent time &#8212; a considerable amount of time with the Chancellor of Germany yesterday.&nbsp; I &#8212; I spent time with the President of the EU yesterday.&nbsp; When we look at the significance of these sanctions, they are immense.&nbsp;<br><br>And so, all nations who are a part of this understand that we cannot take lightly or speak lightly about what we are prepared to do, because we do understand the cost we are exacting, and it is severe.<br><br>So we have had these discussions, again, through a process.&nbsp; We have arrived at this place.&nbsp; And &#8212; and back to the last question, we will, obviously, reassess depending on how the days, weeks, and months ahead roll out.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And do you believe &#8212;</p>



<p>AIDE:&nbsp; Thank you all.</p>



<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; But &#8212; just go on.&nbsp; You can go to the follow-up (inaudible).</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was just going to ask: Do you believe that the U.S. and Ukraine are now more on the same page about what the intelligence suggests than they have been in the past?</p>



<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; I can tell you that there has been direct communication about the intelligence, so nothing is being held back.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vice President, the Prime Minister of Italy does not agree with all of the sanctions plans.&nbsp; He said yesterday that he does not feel that energy should be sanctioned.&nbsp; Does that not undercut U.S. efforts to impose tough, painful, severe financial sanctions?</p>



<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; As I&#8217;ve said, this is an alliance of nations that each have their priorities and their &#8212; their individual concerns about how anything we do going forward will impact their specific country, their economy, and their security.&nbsp;<br><br>So, again, I would not deny Italy from having its perspective or its list of concerns; we all do, actually.&nbsp; That has been part of this process.&nbsp; And so Italy is very much at the table in terms of these conversations about how we can do this in a way that achieves its intended purpose, which &#8212; back to the earlier point &#8212; is about deterring Russia from invading a sovereign nation.<br><br>And we all understand, including every country in Europe, what war in Europe looks like and what it can mean for the citizens of each of those countries.</p>



<p>Thank you.</p>
