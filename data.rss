<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Today, the United States joined global partners – including governments, civil society, and the private sector – in making commitments to the Generation Equality Forum, reasserting U.S. leadership on gender equity and equality on the world stage.</em></p>



<p>The Generation Equality Forum (GEF), convened by UN Women and co-hosted by the governments of France and Mexico, marks the anniversary of the United Nation’s Fourth World Conference on Women held in Beijing over 25 years ago, where the world recognized that “women’s rights are human rights” and adopted an ambitious Platform for Action to achieve equality and opportunity for women around the world.&nbsp; While tremendous progress has been made since the Beijing Conference, serious gaps remain, which have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Generation Equality Forum offers an opportunity to make bold, measurable commitments to build back better and accelerate progress towards the Beijing Platform and the Sustainable Development Goals.</p>



<p>The U.S. commitments reflect the Biden-Harris Administration’s domestic and global priorities, including policy and resource commitments to:</p>



<ul><li>Prevent and respond to all forms of gender-based violence;</li><li>Strengthen women’s economic security; and</li><li>Protect and advance sexual and reproductive health and rights.</li></ul>



<p>Our participation in the Generation Equality Forum is an important part of broader U.S. efforts to advance gender equity and equality, including in areas beyond the scope of commitments announced today, such as climate, science and technology, leadership and democracy, and education. This includes efforts underway to support the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/12/fact-sheet-president-biden-and-g7-leaders-launch-build-back-better-world-b3w-partnership/">Build Back Better World</a>&nbsp;Partnership to meet the tremendous infrastructure needs of low- and middle-income countries, particularly across the areas of gender equity and equality, climate, health and health security, and information and communications technology. Finally, as part of Generation Equality, we have also signed on to the Compact on Women, Peace, and Security and Humanitarian Action and will continue our robust implementation of the U.S. Women, Peace, and Security Act, which strengthens our efforts to prevent, mitigate, and resolve conflict by improving the participation of women in peace and security processes.<br><br>Our Generation Equality Forum commitments include:</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Prevent and Respond to Gender-Based Violence</strong></span><br><span style="text-decoration: underline"><br></span>Preventing and responding to gender-based violence is a significant pillar of the Biden-Harris Administration’s work on gender equity and equality. The “shadow pandemic” of alarming increases in rates of gender-based violence in the U.S. and globally underscore the urgency of our collective efforts.</p>



<p><strong><em>Domestic efforts to combat gender-based violence</em></strong></p>



<ul><li>Create the first U.S. National Action Plan on Gender-Based Violence, led by the White House Gender Policy Council, to be launched in 2022.&nbsp; This plan will establish a whole-of-government approach to preventing and addressing gender-based violence (GBV) domestically and globally, with significant input from civil society.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Provide $450 million in supplementary funding through the President’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/American-Rescue-Plan-Fact-Sheet.pdf">American Rescue Plan</a>&nbsp;to prevent and respond to domestic violence and sexual assault. This includes $200 million for domestic violence services and support; $198 million for sexual assault services programs; and $49.5 million for a new program to fund culturally specific community-based organizations to improve access to services and safety for survivors in historically marginalized communities, with a primary focus on racial and ethnic minority communities.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Reauthorize and strengthen the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), which passed the U. S. House of Representatives this spring with bipartisan support and is pending in the U.S. Senate.&nbsp; First passed in 1994 with then-Senator Biden as its champion, the VAWA is a landmark piece of bipartisan legislation that has transformed the nation&#8217;s response to gender-based violence, bringing critically needed resources to States, Territories, Tribes, and local communities to help prevent and improve the response to domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Request, as part of the FY 2022 President’s Budget, an historic investment of $1 billion to support VAWA programs coordinated through the U.S. Department of Justice—a 95% increase over FY 2021 enacted levels.&nbsp; Also request $463.5 million to be administered through the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, including $250 million to provide cash assistance to survivors of domestic violence to support their short and long-term transition to safety and stability.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Improve prevention and response to sexual assault and harassment in the U.S. military, including by establishing an Independent Review Commission (IRC) on Military Sexual Assault, which conducted a thorough review and recently made significant recommendations on accountability, prevention, climate and culture, and victim support to the U.S. Secretary of Defense and the President.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Strengthen the U.S. National Action Plan on Trafficking in Persons to integrate the administration’s commitments to gender and racial equity.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Propose “safe leave” as part of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/28/fact-sheet-the-american-families-plan/">American Families Plan</a>, a comprehensive paid family and medical leave program that would permit workers eligible to receive paid leave for reasons pertaining to sexual assault, stalking, dating or domestic violence.</li></ul>



<p><strong><em>International efforts to combat gender-based violence</em></strong></p>



<ul><li>Update and strengthen the 2016 U.S. Strategy to Prevent and Respond to Gender-Based Violence Globally,&nbsp;in coordination with the development of the first-ever U.S. National Action Plan to End Gender-Based Violence.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Request, as part of the FY 2022 President’s Budget, $175 million to prevent and respond to gender-based violence globally, as part of a $1.2 billion request for gender programming abroad.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Host the Fourth Trilateral Working Group on Violence Against Indigenous Women and Girls with the Governments of Mexico and Canada. The Biden-Harris Administration will relaunch this regional collaboration, which presents an opportunity to continue to improve and reaffirm our respective national and regional commitments to exchanging information about policies, programs and promising practices to prevent and respond to violence against Indigenous women and girls through increased access to justice and services, with a human rights and culturally-responsive approach.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Double the annual investment by the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief in DREAMS–Determined, Resilient, Empowered, AIDS-Free, Mentored, Safe Partnership–which supports programs focused on economic strengthening, gender-based violence prevention, post-GBV care, and&nbsp;sexual and reproductive health services in Haiti and 14 African countries. The U.S. government will seek to continue this increased level of support during FY2022, pending Congressional notification and approval.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Announce U.S. commitments to the Call to Action on Protection from Gender-Based Violence in Emergencies 2021-2025 Road Map. The U.S. will strengthen its leadership role in addressing GBV within the humanitarian system to ensure this issue is prioritized and resourced from the outset of emergencies. Through the joint State/USAID Safe from the Start initiative, the U.S. will implement Call to Action commitments that seek to strengthen the quality of GBV programming, support improved GBV risk mitigation efforts, and improve resource tracking and accountability for GBV programming as part of humanitarian assistance.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Co-sponsor a resolution on “Ending violence against children through health systems strengthening and multisectoral approaches” during the 2021 World Health Assembly, which was passed by consensus. This resolution prioritizes WHO Member State actions on child protection, to prevent and address early, child, and forced marriage, child trafficking, exploitation and abuse of children and other actions that threaten the emotional, mental, and physical health of children.</li></ul>



<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Advance Women’s Economic Security and Promote Economic Justice&nbsp;</span></strong></p>



<p>The Biden Administration has taken critical steps to strengthen women’s economic security through the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/American-Rescue-Plan-Fact-Sheet.pdf">American Rescue Plan</a>&nbsp;and has proposed once-in-a-generation investments as part of the American Jobs Plan and American Families Plan. The Administration is also committed to advancing women’s economic opportunity and security around the world.</p>



<p><strong><em>Domestic efforts to strengthen women’s economic security</em></strong></p>



<ul><li>Provide immediate relief for women and families through the American Rescue Plan (ARP), helping hard-hit households recover from the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. The ARP expands the Child Tax Credit, allowing more families to benefit, increasing the size of the benefit, and distributing benefits monthly. And it includes a historic investment of more than $40 billion in child care and early learning. States, tribes, and territories can use these investments to help child care providers—who are disproportionately women of color—avoid potential closure and ensure that they can operate safely and increase pay and benefits for care workers, who are also disproportionately women of color. These funds can also be used to help parents better afford high-quality child care.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Propose, as part of the American Jobs Plan, a major investment in care infrastructure, including a $400 billion investment in expanding access to home- or community-based care, expanding access to long-term care services under Medicaid, and additional investments to modernize schools and child care facilities.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Strengthen the workforce pipeline for all, including more women and communities of color, to access in-demand jobs through the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/03/31/fact-sheet-the-american-jobs-plan/">American Jobs Plan</a>, including by investing in apprenticeships and other workforce development programs like Women in Apprenticeship in Non-Traditional Occupations. This commitment includes ensuring jobs with fair and equal pay, safe and healthy workplaces, and workplaces free from racial, gender, and other forms of discrimination and harassment.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Propose, through the American Families Plan (AFP), a $1 trillion commitment to working families, helping cover basic expenses that families need and care most about: making child care and higher education more affordable, lowering the cost of health care over the long term, and continuing to reduce child poverty and put money in parents’ pockets by extending the historic expansion of the Child Tax Credit in the American Rescue Plan. This investment in working families also includes establishing a comprehensive national paid family and medical leave program.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Work with Congress to pass key legislation for women’s employment in addition to the American Jobs Plan and American Families Plan, including the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, which passed the U.S. House of Representatives this spring with bipartisan support.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p><strong><em>International efforts to strengthen women’s economic security</em></strong></p>



<ul><li>Mobilize at least $12 billion—an average $2.4 billion per year, from January 2021 through December 2025—as part of the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation’s new 2X commitment to invest in businesses that advance gender equity in emerging markets.&nbsp; These funds will support 15 million women and girls, including from marginalized communities and fragile and post-conflict settings.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Announce that the Development Finance Corporation will establish 2X Technical Assistance Pilot Program to help private sector clients advance gender equity in their businesses, such as by increasing the number of women in leadership or developing products or services designed specifically to meet the differentiated needs of their women clients.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Establish the Gender Equity and Equality Action (GEEA) Fund—with $100 million in FY 2021 and a request of $200 million in the FY 2022 President’s Budget—to advance economic security for women and girls globally, prevent and respond to gender-based violence, and support underserved and marginalized populations. In addition, the GEEA Fund will help address the disproportionate impact that COVID-19, climate change, and conflict and crisis have on women and girls.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Promote women’s entrepreneurship around the world, including through grants to grassroots and community-led organizations through the Inter-American Foundation and grants to gender-inclusive digital services for women-owned businesses through the U.S.-African Development Foundation.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Commit $33 million in FY 2020 funds to advance gender equity and equality in the Northern Triangle by increasing women’s economic access, agency, and power while reducing gender-based violence in the community, workplace, and household. In addition, commit $2.2 million in FY 2020 funding to small grants for 15 local organizations in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras that advance women’s economic participation through the Inter-American Foundation.</li></ul>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Protect and Expand Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights</strong></span><br><span style="text-decoration: underline"><br></span>The Biden Administration is committed to advancing sexual and reproductive health and rights in the U.S. and around the world. Everyone should have access to quality, affordable health care regardless of their income or where they live.</p>



<p><strong><em>Domestic efforts to protect and expand sexual and reproductive health and rights</em></strong></p>



<ul><li>Remove, as part of the President’s first budget, the Hyde Amendment restriction from government spending bills, reflecting the President’s support for expanding access to health care, including reproductive health care, through Medicaid and other federally-funded programs.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Review rules for Title X of the Public Health Services Act, which provides Federal funding for family planning services that primarily benefit low-income patients, to ensure access to family planning and other preventive health care. The Department of Health and Human Services published a notice of proposed rulemaking related to the Title X program entitled &#8220;Ensuring access to equitable, affordable, client-centered, quality family planning services.&#8221; This proposed rule revises the 2019 rules by readopting the 2000 regulations, with several modifications needed to strengthen the program and ensure access to equitable, affordable, client-centered, quality family planning services for all clients, especially for low-income clients.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Direct $50 million in supplemental funding to the Title X Family Planning Program through the American Rescue Plan, in addition to a&nbsp;proposed $340 million to the Title X Program in the President’s discretionary budget request.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Expand Medicaid postpartum coverage from 60 days to 12 months, ensuring that more new mothers can retain health coverage and stay healthy.</li><li>Propose, as part of the President’s FY 2022 discretionary budget request, $200 million to reduce maternal mortality rates and end race-based disparities, and as part of the American Families Plan, a $3 billion investment to further address the maternal health crisis in the United States, which has a particularly significant impact on Black and Indigenous women, by growing and diversifying the perinatal workforce, improving data collection to better understand the causes of maternal death and complications from birth, and investing in community-based organizations.</li></ul>



<p><strong><em>International efforts to protect and expand sexual and reproductive health and rights</em></strong></p>



<ul><li>Issued a Presidential Memorandum on January 28, 2021 to protect and expand access to comprehensive reproductive health services and care, which rescinded the harmful Mexico City Policy, among other actions.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Propose, as part of the President’s FY 2022 budget request, resuming funding for the UN Population Fund (UNFPA), including $56 million in the FY 2022 President’s Budget, a 72% increase over the FY 2021 enacted level. Funding for UNFPA would directly support the provision of sexual and reproductive health services in fragile contexts, where access to such services is limited.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Support the World Health Organization’s (WHO) strengthening of internal operations, including efforts to prevent and address sexual exploitation and abuse within their workforce and the broader health sector, and to bolster WHO’s capacity to deliver critical services and technical guidance, including in emergency contexts.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Assess the current status of HRP (the UN Development Programme/UN Population Fund/UN Children’s Fund/WHO/World Bank Special Programme of Research, Development and Research Training in Human Reproduction) and how U.S. expertise can align to support its work. The HRP is the primary instrument within the United Nations system for research in human reproduction, and U.S. engagement will help advance critical research, including building research capacity of lower income countries.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Commit publicly with like-minded countries to a series of progressive meetings on continuing and expanding essential sexual and reproductive health service delivery on the margins of WHA and WHO regional committees, the UN General Assembly, World Economic Forum, and World Bank fall meetings, among others.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Commit to supporting women in the global health workforce and affirm U.S. support of the Gender Equal Healthcare Workforce Initiative and its pillars, which aims to minimize and address inequities and inequalities female health workers face globally. This includes harassment and violence, pay inequities, and lack of opportunities for professional training and advancement.</li></ul>

<p>As he continues to move at an historic pace with respect to judicial nominees, the President is announcing eight new candidates for the federal bench and one new candidate&nbsp;for District of Columbia courts, all of whom are extraordinarily qualified, experienced, and devoted to the rule of law and our Constitution.</p>



<p>These choices also continue to fulfill the President’s promise to ensure that the nation’s courts reflect the diversity that is one of our greatest assets as a country — both in terms of personal and professional backgrounds.<br><br>For example, this slate includes:</p>



<ul><li>A woman who would be the first federal judge of South Asian descent in Michigan</li><li>A labor lawyer and former union organizer who would also be the first AAPI judge from Oregon on the Ninth Circuit</li><li>An Assistant U.S. Attorney who would be the second woman of color to ever serve on the federal bench in Virginia</li><li>A former prosecutor with the Department of Justice’s Public Integrity Section who would be the first Hispanic judge on the Court of Federal Claims</li></ul>



<p class="has-text-align-left">This is President Biden’s fifth round of names for federal judicial positions, bringing the number of announced federal judicial nominees to 32.<br><br>President Biden has spent decades committed to strengthening the federal bench, which is why he continues to move at an unparalleled speed with respect to judicial nominations. His first judicial nominations announcement was made faster than that of any new President in modern American history, and today’s announcement continues that trend.</p>

<p>I commend the work of the Libyan Political Dialogue Forum (LPDF) as its members meet in Geneva this week to finalize preparations for Libya to hold historic national elections on December 24, 2021.&nbsp;As the Berlin II conference affirmed, the United States stands together with our Libyan and international partners in full support for holding presidential and parliamentary elections on time that will enable Libyans to choose their own leaders and re-establish their sovereignty after years of civil conflict and economic upheaval. This builds on recent progress with the establishment of the interim Government of National Unity.</p>



<p>We are encouraged by the positive atmosphere and spirit of compromise in which the LPDF is meeting, with active United Nations facilitation, to adopt the constitutional and legislative arrangements needed for elections. We support the Libyan people as they chart a path toward a more stable, prosperous, and secure future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>The Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework addresses economic disparities in our economy and the consequences of decades of disinvestment in America’s infrastructure that have fallen most heavily on communities of color. Through critical investments, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework increases access to good-paying jobs, affordable high-speed internet, reliable public transit, clean drinking water and other resources to ensure communities of color get a fair shot at the American dream.</p>



<p>These critical investments are first steps in advancing equity and racial justice throughout our economy. The President believes additional investments are needed in our nation’s caregiving infrastructure, housing supply, regional development, and workforce development programs to ensure that communities of color and other underserved communities can access economic opportunity and justice. And, earlier this month in Tulsa, OK, President Biden announced a whole-of-government effort to increase the share of federal contracts going to small disadvantaged businesses by 50 percent over the next five years, leveraging the government’s purchasing power to help more Americans realize their entrepreneurial dreams.</p>



<p>The Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework:</p>



<p><strong>DELIVERS HIGH SPEED INTERNET TO EVERY AMERICAN HOUSEHOLD</strong></p>



<p>There is a stark digital divide in America. Black families are 9% less likely to have high-speed internet than their white peers, and Latino Americans are 15% less likely. About 35% of individuals living on Tribal lands lack access to broadband service. And although studies suggest high levels of digital access for Asian Americans, these studies are often limited in scope and don’t identify key inequities. For example, broadband access and affordability in the Pacific Islands has long been a challenge. During the COVID-19 pandemic, there were stories of kids sitting in McDonald’s parking lots to log on to remote school in parts of the country. The President believes this is unacceptable.</p>



<p>The Framework invests $65 billion to make high-speed broadband available to all Americans, to bring down high-speed internet prices across the board, and to close the digital divide. His plan will also invest in long overdue expansion of broadband on Tribal lands, in consultation with Tribal Nations. With the 1936 Rural Electrification Act, the Federal government made a historic investment in bringing electricity to nearly every home and farm in America, and millions of families and our economy reaped the benefits. Broadband internet is the new electricity. It is necessary for Americans to do their jobs, to participate equally in school learning and health care, and to stay connected.</p>



<p>In addition to achieving President Biden’s goal of connecting every American to reliable high- speed internet, the Framework will drive down prices for internet service and close the digital divide by making broadband more affordable, including in low-income communities and communities of color.</p>



<p><strong>ELIMINATES LEAD PIPES AND DELIVERS CLEAN DRINKING WATER TO EVERY HOUSEHOLD</strong></p>



<p>Across the country, pipes and treatment plants are aging and polluted drinking water is endangering public health. There are up to 10 million homes with lead service lines and pipes. Children in up to 400,000 schools and child care facilities are at risk of exposure to lead.</p>



<p>Across the country, families of color are at the highest risk for lead exposure at home and in schools. Communities of color in cities like Chicago, Milwaukee, and Newark are also at particular risk. For kids, higher exposure to lead can negatively affect academic performance, and can lead to cardiovascular disease later in life. By some estimates, each lead service line replaced at a cost of $5,000 per line leads to $22,000 in health savings.</p>



<p>The Framework makes the largest investment in clean drinking water in American history, replacing all of the nation’s lead pipes and service lines. From rural towns to struggling cities, the Framework invests in water infrastructure across America, including in Tribal Nations and disadvantaged communities that need it most.</p>



<p><strong>INVESTS IN MORE PUBLIC TRANSIT OPTIONS AND ADDRESSING THE BACKLOG OF REPAIRS</strong></p>



<p>Asian American and African American workers commute by public transit at nearly 4 times the rate of white workers. For example, low-wage Black residents in Chicago spend 70 additional minutes commuting to work than their white peers. In New York City, the average Black resident spends 110 minutes more per week commuting to work than the average white resident.</p>



<p>The Framework’s historic investment in public transit – the largest federal investment in history – will reduce commute times and create more economic opportunities in communities of color.</p>



<p>The Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework invests $48.5 billion to modernize transit, and improve accessibility for older Americans and people with disabilities. It will clear the backlog in public transit repairs, and build new transit. It will replace thousands of transit vehicles, including buses, with clean, zero emission vehicles.</p>



<p>These investments will yield significant returns for communities of color. Investments in public transit help people get better jobs and higher wages, and raise economic growth and productivity. One study found that a metropolitan area’s 10 percent increase in transit seats or rail service miles per capita is associated with up to $1.8 billion per year in increased wages. Another study found that improved transit access increases labor force participation.</p>



<p><strong>CREATES A FIRST-EVER PROGRAM TO RECONNECT COMMUNITIES DIVIDED BY INEQUITABLE TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE</strong></p>



<p>Significant portions of the interstate highway system were built through Black neighborhoods, destroying homes, schools, churches, and parks and causing lasting disconnection and disinvestment for residents who stayed. More broadly, historic investments in transportation infrastructure, especially highway construction, cut too many Americans off from opportunity, dividing and demolishing communities, and perpetuating economic and racial injustices. The Framework creates a first-ever program to reconnect</p>



<p>communities divided by transportation infrastructure. The program will fund planning, design, demolition, and reconstruction of street grids, parks, or other infrastructure. This is in addition to other major grant programs that could fund elements of these projects.</p>



<p><strong>ELECTRIFY SCHOOL BUSES, IMPROVING THE AIR QUALITY FOR KIDS</strong></p>



<p>The Framework will make a critical down payment on helping the more than 25 million children and thousands of bus drivers who breathe polluted air on their rides to and from school. Diesel air pollution is linked to asthma and other health problems that hurt our communities and cause students to miss school, particularly in communities of color and Tribal communities. The Framework will deliver more than 35,000 electric school buses nationwide, helping school districts across the country buy clean, American-made, zero emission buses, replacing a sizable percent of the yellow school bus fleet.</p>



<p><strong>REMEDIATES BROWNFIELD AND SUPERFUND SITES</strong></p>



<p>26% of Black Americans and 29% of Hispanic Americans live within 3 miles of a Superfund site, a higher percentage than for Americans overall. Proximity to a Superfund site can lead to elevated levels of lead in children’s blood. Recent studies demonstrate that cleaning up these sites can lead to a decrease in blood levels by approximately 13-26%.</p>



<p>The Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework provides the full American Jobs Plan funding level &#8212; $21 billion – to create good-paying union jobs plugging orphan oil and gas wells, cleaning up abandoned mines, and remediating Brownfield and Superfund sites. 26% of Black Americans and 29% of Hispanic Americans live within 3 miles of a Superfund site, a higher percentage than for Americans overall. As we transition to a clean energy future, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework will begin to remedy economic injustice for communities across the country that have relied on the fossil fuel industry and have been affected most by the impacts of climate change and pollution, including rural communities and communities of color.</p>



<p><strong>SAFEGUARDS COMMUNITIES OF COLOR FROM CLIMATE CRISES AND EXTREME WEATHER RISKS</strong></p>



<p>People of color are more likely to live in areas most vulnerable to flooding and other climate change-related weather events. For example, in the wake of Hurricane Harvey, Black and Hispanic residents were twice as likely to report lost income. Tribal lands are significantly at risk to the effects of climate change and Alaska Natives are particularly vulnerable, as they face multiple climate impacts.</p>



<p>The Framework invests $52 billion in helping communities build resilience to wildfires and floods through investments in forest management and upgrades to critical infrastructure &#8212; like elevating buildings, roads, and bridges, hardening physical infrastructure, and winterizing the power grid. And, it will fund state and local infrastructure improvements and emergency response strategies, such as planning grants to support development of evacuation routes or upgrading community shelters. The Framework will also make it easier for low-income families to buy flood insurance.</p>



<p><strong>INVESTS IN CLEAN ENERGY GRID TO MITIGATE THE DISPARATE IMPACTS OF POLLUTION ON COMMUNITIES OF COLOR</strong></p>



<p>Black, Latino, Asian American and Pacific Islander, and Native communities are more likely to be burdened by pollution. Black people are almost three times more likely to die from asthma related causes than their white counterparts. And more than one in three &#8212; or over 23 million &#8212; Latinos in the U.S. live in counties where the air doesn’t meet EPA public health standards for smog.</p>



<p>The Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework helps meet this challenge by making the single largest investment in clean transmission in American history. It creates a Grid Development Authority at the Department of Energy to enable a national, clean energy power grid and funds to support activities that reduce the impacts to the electric grid, and protect communities from extreme weather, wildfire, and natural disasters. It deploys long distance, high voltage transmission to enhance reliability and resilience, lower costs, and integrate the highest value clean energy resources. It invests in research and development for advanced transmission and electricity distribution technologies, and smart grid technologies that deliver flexibility and resilience. And, it invests more than $22 billion in demonstration projects and research hubs for next generation technologies like advanced nuclear reactors, carbon capture for industrial plants, and green hydrogen.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">La Crosse Municipal Transit Utility<br>La Crosse, Wisconsin</p>



<p>12:58 P.M. CDT<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:  Good afternoon.  Thank you, Laurie.  Please, please, please sit down.  I once said that to a big crowd; it was in the evening.  I said, “Please, sit down.”  And there were no seats.  They were out in a football field.  (Laughter.)  And the press pointed out, “Biden is losing it.”  (Laughter.)  Well, I can see you all have seats.  (Laughter.)<br><br>Laurie, thank you very much.  I told Laurie, when she was showing me the bus she&#8217;s driving now: Back when I was in law school, I drove a school bus during the summers to pick up spending money.  And from one bus driver to another, Laurie, I want to thank you for all you do to make this city run, to help folks get where they need to go.  And you do it in a way that sometimes is not always easy. <br><br>I&#8217;m glad to be here with great Wisconsin leaders.  Gov, I guess I landed at the airport just a few minutes before you did.  Thank you for making the effort to be here.  And my good friend, Tammy Baldwin &#8212; Senator Baldwin is here.  And Congressman Ron Kind is &#8212; and, Mom, thank you for raising a good kid.  (Applause.) <br><br>And Mayor Reynolds.  I was telling the Mayor &#8212; he just won reelec- &#8212; he won election.  And I said, “You know, I always wonder why everybody runs for mayor,” because they &#8212; it&#8217;s the hardest job in American politics.  They know where you live.  You can&#8217;t go to the grocery store.  “Why is that pothole still there?”  I get it.  You don&#8217;t even control that. <br><br>But anyway, Mr. Mayor, thank you for your service.  Thank you for willing to serve. <br><br>I&#8217;m here in Wisconsin to celebrate a step forward for my country &#8212; our country &#8212; to talk a little bit about what it&#8217;s going to mean for working families here in Wisconsin and across the nation. <br><br>When I was sworn in five months ago, I pledged to put my whole soul into bringing America together.  I said I was running for three reasons, the last one of which I said is unite America. <br><br>I admit it&#8217;s difficult, and I think some of my friends in the press thought it was impossible.  I still don&#8217;t think it is but &#8212; because I believe that there&#8217;s nothing we cannot do if we bring &#8212; come together as a nation, Democrats and Republicans.  And we’re really divided on a whole range of things. <br><br>But if you look back across our history, from the Transcontinental Railroad to the creation of the Internet, you can see the truth in that idea, about coming together.  Because America &#8212; America has always been propelled into the future by landmark national investments &#8212; investments that only the government has the capacity to make; only the government, working together, could make.<br><br>Today happens to mark &#8212; coincidental &#8212; but today is the <s>60th</s> [65th] anniversary of one of those significant investments to change the nation.  Sixty-five years ago today, President Dwight Eisenhower signed the bill that created the Interstate Highway System.  Sixty-five years ago today.  That was the last infrastructure investment of the size and scope of what &#8212; the agreement I&#8217;m about to talk about today. <br><br>It&#8217;s time for us to write a new chapter in that story.  After months of careful negotiation, of listening, of compromising together in a good faith, moving together, with ups and downs and some blips, a bipartisan group of senators got together and they forged an agreement to move forward on the key priorities of my American Jobs Plan &#8212; and one of them is sitting in front of me. <br><br>As a result, this is a generational investment &#8212; a generational investment to modernize our infrastructure, creating millions of good-paying jobs &#8212; and that&#8217;s not coming from me; that’s coming from Wall Street &#8212; millions of good-paying jobs that position America to compete with the rest of the world in the 21st century &#8212; because China is way out-working us, in terms of infrastructure. <br><br>And it&#8217;s going to make the world of difference for families here in Wisconsin.  Here&#8217;s what it&#8217;s going to do: This deal will put American workers to work in good-paying jobs, not minimum wage jobs, not 15-dollar-an-hour jobs.  Prevailing wage job, good-paying jobs, repairing our roads and our bridges. <br><br>You all know why that matters.  One in five miles of highway and roads in America are in poor condition.  One in five miles.  Some states it’s worse where the weather is tougher.  Five perc- &#8212; 50 years &#8212; <s>50</s> [40] percent of our bridges are over 50 years old.  More than 1,000 bridges here in Wisconsin are rated as structurally deficient by engineers.  One thousand just in Wisconsin. <br><br>And I&#8217;m not &#8212; that doesn&#8217;t make Wisconsin better or worse; it&#8217;s &#8212; all across the nation is this way.  The bridges &#8212; the 10 most traveled bridges in America need repair, and some need to be completely rebuilt.  More than 600 &#8212; more than 600 here in the state of Wisconsin &#8212; bridges have weight limits to prevent trucks from crossing.  That means long detours for farmers heading to market.<br><br>It’s more than just an inconvenience; it’s about safety, as well.  In November 2019, a school bus in Arcadia, Wisconsin, tipped over going around a curve and went into a ditch with 20 students on board.  It wasn’t because of snow or ice; it was just an old country road.  It was rough conditions.  Thank God nobody was seriously injured at the time.<br><br>But this is a drain on our economy, as well.  Typical American &#8212; typical American &#8212; and it varies slightly from state to state &#8212; but the typical American pays a hidden tax of more than $1,000 a year in wasted time &#8212; wasted time and fuel due to traffic congestion.<br><br>Now, in the more the rural areas, the less the congestion.  But it creates other difficulties.<br><br>You all know that feeling: losing time, sitting in traffic, or being rerouted because the bridge isn’t wide enough or the road is poorly maintained.<br><br>This deal is going to put Americans back to fixing all of that, and good-paying jobs.  This deal will also put Americans to work replacing 100 percent of our nation’s lead water pipes.  You know, there’s 400,000 &#8212; well, I won’t get into the numbers; I get a little carried away &#8212; but it’s really dangerous.  Every single American child, at home or in school, will soon be able to turn on that faucet, and their moms and dads know that the water they’re drinking is clean and safe.<br><br>I’ll give you an example of why that matters.  Just look at the city of Milwaukee.  Milwaukee has more than 160,000 water service lines.  More than 70,000 of them, nearly half, have lead service lines.<br><br>And, by the way, I’m not &#8212; it’s not picking on Wisconsin, Gov.  Every state is like this.  But just to know what you’re going to be doing for the state of Wisconsin here.<br><br>You know, we know that exposure to lead in drinking water can trigger a number of serious problems.  Even low levels of lead can cause behavior and learning problems in children, impairing their growth.<br><br>There are up to 10 million homes with lead pipe service lines and pipes.  Children in up to 400,000 schools &#8212; 400,000 schools &#8212; and childcare facilities are at risk of exposure to lead.  This deal contains the largest investment in clean drinking water and waste water infrastructure in American history.<br><br>This deal also provides something you’re very familiar with in the Island.  It provides funding to get dangerous chemicals out of our water systems, known as PFAs, or &#8220;forever chemicals.&#8221;  This is a problem all across the country, and I know that you’re feeling it right here &#8212; right here.<br><br>Here in La Crosse County, just this spring, the state had to provide free bottled water to thousands of people on French Island because they were worried about those chemicals in the groundwater, which were linked to cancer and other illnesses.  We’ll pay for that.  We’ll get that done. <br><br>We’re also going to surge federal resources to help address the forever chemicals not just here, but all across America.  Unfortunately, Wisconsin is not unique in this problem.<br><br>This deal will also put Americans to work building transmission lines &#8212; the largest investment in clean energy transmission in American history.  Power outages cost the U.S. economy up to &#8212; now, this is &#8212; now, we know this, but until you add it up, it doesn’t seem to be that big a deal.  It costs the economy, Congressman, $70 billion annually.  You hear me?  Nationally, $70 billion annually.<br><br>And as climate change induces extreme weather events more and more frequently, we need to make investments to build a more resilient grid to carry this electricity. <br><br>The majority of the nation’s grid is aging.  Some components are over a century old.  And 70 percent of transmission and distribution lines are well into the second half of their lifespans.  You saw what happened in Texas this winter: The entire system in the state collapsed.  The entire system. <br><br>That’s why we have to act.  This deal will modernize the power grid to be more energy efficient and resilient to &#8212; and resistant to extreme weather; resilient against bad actors who try to hack and attack the grid.  Because I just spent a lot of time in Europe trying to work on that.<br><br>And it’s going to strengthen and revitalize our natural infrastructure, like our coastlines and levees, while preparing our physical infrastructure for wildfires, floods, and other extreme weather. <br><br>Anybody ever believe you&#8217;d &#8212; you hear &#8212; turn on the news, and it&#8217;ll say it was 116 degrees in Portland, Oregon.  A hundred and sixteen degrees.  &#8220;But don&#8217;t worry, there is no global warming.  It doesn&#8217;t exist.  It&#8217;s a figment of our imagination.&#8221;  Seriously. <br><br>When a severe storm rolls in, like you had in some parts of the state just recently, the power is going to be less likely to go out, town water systems will be able to withstand what happens if we &#8212; once we make these investments.<br><br>And all &#8212; as all of you know, America has one of the highest road fatality rates of anywhere in the industrial world.  Let me say that again: the highest road fatality rates of any industrial nation in the world.  I lost a wife and daughter and almost lost two sons.<br><br>Look, our fatality rate is double the rate in Canada on a per capita basis.  I bet every one of you here can tell me what the most dangerous intersections in your town are.  I&#8217;ll lay eight to five, no matter what the town is.  Maybe you don&#8217;t have many, but everybody knows what intersections are the most dangerous.<br><br>When you&#8217;re teaching your kid to drive, what do you do?  You tell them, &#8220;No, don&#8217;t go down that road when you come home.&#8221;  I&#8217;m being deadly earnest.  &#8220;When you come home, come home the other way.&#8221;<br><br>Well, guess what?  We got an agreement to invest $11 billion to help cities and localities reduce crashes and fatalities in the community &#8212; especially for cyclists and pedestrians, which are increasingly significant. <br><br>This deal is going to more than double the funding directed to state and local programs that improve the safety of people in vehicles, including highway safety, truck safety, pipeline and hazardous materials safety. <br><br>I won&#8217;t even get into this now, but, you know, we have &#8212; we have thousands of miles of pipeline.  The vast majority of those pipes are 60 years or older &#8212; some of them more than 80 years old.  A lot of them are leaking. <br><br>This is the United States of America, for God&#8217;s sake.  What are we not doing? <br><br>This deal will also help high-speed Internet and make sure it&#8217;s available to every American home, including 35 percent of rural families who currently go without it. <br><br>As of last spring, more than 82,000 children here in Wisconsin, which prides itself on its education, didn&#8217;t have reliable Internet access at home.  Think about that year &#8212; in a year of remote schooling.  When so many of our needs and our connections were forced to move online, tens of thousands of Wisconsin kids got left behind. <br><br>Did you ever think, here in America, that kids would have to sit in a fast-food parking lot just to do their schoolwork and homework because they could connect online?  Not a joke.  Ask any mom who has kids in school or a dad who is taking care of them.  No child should have to do that. <br><br>And no farmer here in Wisconsin should lose business because they don&#8217;t have a reliable connection to the Internet &#8212; know when to buy, know when to sell, and know what&#8217;s going on. <br><br>You know, back in 1936, the federal government brought electricity to nearly every home and farm in America, and it spread the opportunity out for cities in every part of the country.  It changed the lives and fortunes of thousands and thousands of homeowners, thousands of hometowns, and millions of American families.  And it set the stage for a massive, sustained economic boom that would follow World War Two.<br><br>High-speed Internet is the equivalent of that today.  It&#8217;s a similar &#8212; it&#8217;s an equivalent of that.  It isn&#8217;t a luxury; it&#8217;s now a necessity, like water and electricity.  And this deal would provide for it for everyone, while bringing down the cost of Internet service across the board. <br><br>This deal has also put Americans to work through a first-ever national effort to install electric vehicle charging stations &#8212; 500,000 charging stations nationwide along our highways and in rural and disadvantaged communities as well. <br><br>Think about what that can mean to the American autoworker and the future of electric vehicles.  China is going full bore.  They&#8217;re providing more electric vehicles than any nation in the world.  You know, it used to be, when I first got to the United States Senate, actually a couple of &#8212; actually, in the ‘60s, when I was getting out &#8212; the late ‘60s, when I was getting out of law school, what happened?  We invested more in R&amp;D and investment and manufacturing than any nation in the world. <br><br>Now we’re number eight in the world.  China used to be number nine; now they’re number two in the world. <br><br>And when you build a charging station, it spurs even more investment and more infrastructure around it &#8212; the local convenience store, the local hamburger place.  You know, think about &#8212; nobody is old enough, but my dad used to tell me &#8212; because he worked, back in the days, for the American Oil Company &#8212; they came along with the &#8212; the combustion engine.  You needed to be able to put gas in the engine.  I mean in the car &#8212; the tank.  Well, guess what?  You had to build gas stations. <br><br>One of my dad’s jobs and my Grandpop Biden’s jobs was to go from city to city convincing them it was okay to bury these great big tanks with gasoline in them.  And entire communities grew up around it. <br><br>Well, this is exactly what we have to do with regard to electric vehicles.  This deal is also going to help our cities, our towns, our school districts deploy electric buses.  Thirty-five thousand electric school buses that are accounted for.  And there are about 475,000 school buses in this country, 95 percent of them like the ones you had here &#8212;<br><br>(A child falls off their chair.)  Is he okay, honey?  You sure?  He took a little bit of a tumble.<br><br>Ninety-five percent of them run on diesel.  So, every day, more than 25 million kids and thousands of bus drivers breathe polluted air on the way to and from school. <br><br>Diesel air pollution is linked to asthma and other health problems.  It hurts communities.  It causes students to get sick and miss time in school. <br><br>We owe it to our kids to clean up the school buses, and this deal will help do just that.<br><br>I know that the city of La Crosse is getting two electric transit buses this fall &#8212; I think I saw them both.  I was down in the Carolinas, looking at the bus company where you’re going to buy them &#8212; charging stations to power them. <br><br>This bipartisan deal &#8212; by the way, you had half Republicans and half Democrats come along and present this deal and negotiate this deal.  It’s going to help advance that effort. <br><br>This deal also &#8212; also modernizes our outdated airports, ports, and waterways.  That means fewer delays that drain away so much money from families and from businesses.  There’s no good reason why that zero &#8212; zero of the top 25 airports in the world are in American.  Zero.  Not one in the United States of America.<br><br>This deal will put Americans to work through long-overdue national environmental cleanups.  That means good-paying jobs, capping hundreds of thousands of abandoned oil and gas wells that need to be cleaned up and capped &#8212; methane leaks &#8212; protecting the health of our communities.  Making the same money it took to dig that well.  And there’s thousands of them. <br><br>Not to mention, this deal represents the largest investment in American passenger rail and in freight rail since the creation of Amtrak. <br><br>Now, I know I’m “Mr. Amtrak.”  I’ve traveled over 2 million miles on Amtrak.  I commuted every day.  I get it.  I know you think I’m nuts.  But after my wife and daughter were killed, I decided to commute back and forth to Delaware.  It was a 257-mile roundtrip. <br><br>I’ll tell you a real quick story.  I shouldn’t bore you with it.  But, you know, the Secret Service &#8212; they’re the best in the world &#8212; doesn’t like you taking Amtrak because it stops too many times &#8212; the train.  They want me flying home in the small jets that were available as Vice President.  And that cost a lot of money, so I would go home on Fridays, you know, because my mom was passing away.  I’d go home on Amtrak.  And they published &#8212; they keep fastidious record of the miles you travel in an air- &#8212; in a Air Force aircraft as President and Vice President. <br><br>And toward the end of my term, a headline came out in all of the papers: “Biden travels…” &#8212; I think it was 1.3 or 1.7 million miles on Air Force planes.  And so, I’m getting on the train on that Friday, and these guys who all became my family &#8212; all &#8212; the conductor.  And a guy named Angelo Negri came up, and he goes, “Joey, baby!”  Grabs my cheek like that.  (Laughter.)  And I thought they were going to shoot him.  I really did.  (Laughter.) <br><br>I said, “No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  He’s a friend.”  He was like, &#8220;What the hell.&#8221;  And he said, “Big deal, Joey.  A million…&#8221; &#8212; whatever it was &#8212; &#8220;…three-hundred thousand miles.  You know how many miles you&#8217;ve traveled on Amtrak, Joey?&#8221;  And I said, &#8220;No, Ang.  I don&#8217;t.&#8221;  And he said, &#8220;At that retirement dinner, we calculated it.  We estimated 127 days a year, 250 miles back and forth, 3 &#8212; 36 years, then as Vice President.  Joey, you traveled more on Amtrak.&#8221;  (Laughter.)<br><br>Well, I &#8212; and when they named a station after me in my city, someone complained that Biden is using his influence.  I said, &#8220;Hell, they should name the whole Northeast Corridor after me.&#8221;  I&#8217;ve &#8212; (laughter) &#8212; more than anybody else. <br><br>But all kidding aside, studies show that if you can get to your destination in the same amount of time or less on rail than you can by car, people will take rail.  And, Gov, you know this better than anybody.  Imagine if you could get from Chicago &#8212; from La Crosse to Chicago in two hours, instead of four and a half.  That&#8217;s what this will allow us to build the capacity to do.<br><br>And besides, it will not only make your travel easier, not &#8212; I don&#8217;t know why you&#8217;d go to Chicago, but &#8212; you know, all kidding aside &#8212; it would reduce the largest source of pollution in America: vehicle travel.<br><br>We&#8217;re not just tinkering around the edges here.  We&#8217;re going to invest $66 billion in rail to eliminate backlogs, bring world-class rail service to areas outside the Northeast.<br><br>Here in Wisconsin, we’ll add new stops in Green Bay, Madison, and Eau Claire.<br><br>This deal also makes the largest investment in public transit in American history.  A whole lot of people here in Wisconsin depend on public transportations, like the bus system here in La Crosse, to get to work, to school, and get around.  Because of this deal, it will be safer, quicker, cleaner, more frequent, and more avail- &#8212; more reliable. <br><br>More transit options mean more people can access good job &#8212; access good jobs as well.  One study found that it leads to higher wages for workers because businesses can attract more customers with the rail.<br><br>This bipartisan breakthrough is a great deal for the American people &#8212; not just for folks in the cities, not just for red states or blue states, but for everybody.<br><br>And this job &#8212; this jobs &#8212; the jobs that are going to be created here &#8212; largely, it&#8217;s going to be those for blue-collar workers, the majority of whom will not have to have a college degree to have those jobs. <br><br>A lot of those folks are being left behind now.  The guys I grew up with in Scranton and Claymont are being left behind.  This is the answer for good-paying jobs.  Jobs is jo- &#8212; jobs not just in our biggest cities, along our coasts, but in small towns across the country so families can build wealth and opportunity in rural hometowns and don&#8217;t have to leave when they&#8217;re grown up. <br><br>We&#8217;ve said it all along: This is a blue-collar blueprint to rebuild America.  And long before, families in Wisconsin are going to see the benefits firsthand. <br><br>Look, I&#8217;m always quoting my dad because he was smart and I loved him.  My dad used to say, “Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck.  It&#8217;s about your dignity.  It&#8217;s about respect.  It&#8217;s about your place in the community.&#8221;  I mean he really would say this.  When he lost everything in Scranton and we had to move down to Claymont, Delaware &#8212; a little steel town. <br><br>And he said &#8212; and the deal is going to deliver breathing room.  All he said was, &#8220;All you want, as a middle-class person, is just to have a little bit of breathing room.  Not &#8212; just a little bit of breathing room.&#8221; <br><br>That&#8217;s why we got to build this economy from the bottom up and the middle out, not trickle down &#8212; creating good-paying jobs with dignity and jobs that cannot be outsourced.<br><br>And critically, we’re going to get it all done without raising taxes on a single American earning less than $400,000.  Now, all of you making over $400,000, I love you, but I don&#8217;t mind a little bit if your taxes go up a little bit. <br><br>But all kidding aside, I made a commitment: Nobody &#8212; I would not support anything that raised a penny in tax on someone making under 400 grand.  And that means, in this bill, there is no gas tax.  Working families have already paid enough.<br><br>Instead, we’re going to pay for these investments, in part, by giving the Internal Revenue Service the resources it needs to collect taxes on the wealthiest Americans who owe but are currently not paying under the existing tax rules. <br><br>And, by the way, it&#8217;s not done by this &#8212; it will be done by conservative economists and liberal economists.  It cracks down on tax cheats, not just hardworking, middle-class Americans.<br><br>And there&#8217;s a lot of important investments in this deal that are long overdue.  Economists of all stripes agree that it&#8217;s going to create good jobs and dramatically strengthen our economy in the long run.  It makes it easier for businesses to seamly [seamlessly] transport their goods, makes it easier for workers to more easily access job opportunities.<br><br>But the reason this agreement matters so much &#8212; it&#8217;s about what it represents.  This deal isn’t just the sum of its parts; it’s a signal to ourselves and to the world that American democracy can come through and deliver for all our people.  We can be united.<br><br>I just met with the G7.  I just met with all of NATO.  And I just met with Putin.  The autocrats think that democracy can&#8217;t keep up with autocrats.  Not a joke. <br><br>But it’s living proof that we can still come together in this country and accomplish something big and transformational.<br><br>I know that neither the Democrats nor Republicans get everything they want in this agreement.  It&#8217;s not all that I proposed.  But that’s what our economy is all about.  That’s what it means to compromise and reach consensus.  And that&#8217;s what every &#8212; in the heart of every democracy.<br><br>And we can&#8217;t give up on what we &#8212; keep finding ways to come together.  Because every time we negotiate in good faith and come together to get something big done, we break a little more of the ice that too often keeps us frozen in place and prevents us from solving the real problems people are facing.<br><br>Let me be clear: There’s much more to do.  And I&#8217;m going to continue to fight for more.  I am going to keep working with Congress to pass even more of my economic agenda so we can keep building an economy from the bottom up and the middle out.<br><br>As we bring home key parts of my American Jobs Plan, I’m going to make the case &#8212; and I&#8217;ve told this to the negotiators &#8212; I&#8217;m going to &#8212; I&#8217;m going to continue to make the case there &#8212; critical investments are still needed, including those in my Family Plan &#8212; American Family Plan.<br><br>Maybe the most important among them is extending the Child Tax Credit, which will significantly benefit middle-class and working folks.  Let me explain what that is. <br><br>Pretty soon, taxpayers in America are going to get a significant check back from the IRS.  For example, if you are &#8212; if you &#8212; if you have to pay taxes and you have a good income, you get to deduct $2,000 per dependent &#8212; per child.  And that comes off the bottom line of your taxes, and you probably still owe more after that’s cut off. <br><br>But for families &#8212; for families who, in fact, don’t have that big a tax bill, they don’t get anything from this.  So, we changed the law this year, and it’s cutting child poverty by 40 percent.  And here in Wisconsin, by July 15th, we’re going to start &#8212; they&#8217;re going to be picking up the phone and calling you to say, “Thanks, Gov.”  And they&#8217;re going to get checks from the IRS. <br><br>Here’s what&#8217;s in it: For every child you have under the age of six, you&#8217;re going to get $3,600.  And for every child under the age of &#8212; between &#8212; over the age of 12, you&#8217;re going to get $3,000.  So, you&#8217;ll actually get a cash payment instead of just a credit against your taxes, because you don&#8217;t pay that many taxes if you&#8217;re &#8212; if you&#8217;re making &#8212; if you&#8217;re making the minimum wage or you&#8217;re making $20-, $30-, $40,000 a year.  And people say, “Well, that&#8217;s a giveaway.”  You guys, I think it&#8217;s time to give ordinary people a tax break.  The wealthy are doing fine.  (Applause.)  No, I mean it.  I mean it. <br><br>Why is this not a tax break for working folks, when the stuff we give to the super wealthy are called “tax breaks”?  Look, major action on clean energy, housing, caregiving, on child and paid leave, universal pre-K, free community college. The human infrastructure is intertwined with our physical infrastructure.  It’s going to help us create more good jobs, ease the burden on working families, and strengthen our economy in the long run. <br><br>And I&#8217;m going out &#8212; I&#8217;m &#8212; I&#8217;m going to be out there making the case for the American people until this job is done; until we bring this bipartisan deal home; until our human infrastructure, also, needs are met; until we have a fair tax system to pay for all of this. <br><br>And, by the way, what I&#8217;m talking about in the Family Plan &#8212; let me tell you how I&#8217;m going to pay for it.  And the American people, in the polling data, overwhelmingly support it. If we just raise the corporate tax to 28 percent &#8212; it used to be 35 percent.  It was supposed to come down to 28; it’s now 21.  If you raise it to 28 percent, you know how much money that raises?  $1.4 trillion.  If you have a minimum global tax, which we agreed to in Europe &#8212; that means so corporations can’t avoid paying the taxes at home &#8212; that would generate, in America, $385 billion.  If you end deductions for foreign corporations who ship their profits out of the United States, that raises $260 billion in these tax havens.<br><br>You know, there are 30 corporations in America of Fortune 500 making billion &#8212; I’m &#8212; I come from the corporate capital of the world, Delaware.  Not a joke.  More corporations are incorporated in Delaware than all the rest in America combined.  Okay? <br><br>And guess what?  Fifteen of the Fortune 500 companies last year paid &#8212; I mean, 30 &#8212; excuse me &#8212; paid zero taxes, and they made billions of dollars.  Paid not a penny in tax, not a single cent.<br><br>I&#8217;m not trying to punish anybody.  I&#8217;m just saying, “Let&#8217;s be fair.”  If you just set up a minimum tax &#8212; you had to pay at least 15 percent of your earnings as a corporation &#8212; that alone would raise $230 billion. <br><br>The point is, I have never had a reputation of being someone who&#8217;s out there trying to just out-tax people.  But here&#8217;s the deal, folks: I think it&#8217;s about time there be fairness in the tax code.  I don’t want you paying more than your share.<br><br>But the tax cut that was passed under Trump &#8212; the $2 trillion, not a penny of which was paid for &#8212; where did it go?  Over 80 percent of it went to the top one quarter of 1 percent.  I think you should be able to be a billionaire.  I think you should be able to be a millionaire.  But, for God&#8217;s sake, at least pay.  Pay your fair share.  Pay your fair share.<br><br>Folks, there’s a lot of work ahead to finish the job I’ve just outlined.  There’ll be more disagreements to resolve, more compromises to forge along the way. <br><br>But, today, the American people can be proud of Democrats and Republicans; families here in Wisconsin can be proud; Congress can be proud, because this country came together, forged a bipartisan deal &#8212; which a lot of has to do with your state &#8212; your senator &#8212; that delivers for everybody.  We’ve shown the world and, just as importantly, we&#8217;ve shown ourselves that American democracy can come through.  There&#8217;s nothing &#8212; nothing, nothing &#8212; beyond our capacity when we come together as one nation.<br><br>So, thank you, Wisconsin.  Thank you all for who you are and what you do.  May God bless you all, and may God protect our troops.  Thank you, Wisconsin.  (Applause.) <br><br>1:31 P.M. CDT</p>

<p>Dear Madam Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)<br><br>At my direction, on June 27, 2021, United States forces conducted targeted strikes against facilities at two locations in Syria and one location in Iraq near the Iraq-Syria border.  These facilities were used by Iran-backed militia groups that have been involved in a series of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and rocket attacks against United States personnel and facilities in Iraq.  These militia attacks have escalated in recent months.  Recent rocket attacks have included ones on Balad Air Base on April 4, April 18, and May 3, 2021; the Baghdad Diplomatic Support Center near the Baghdad International Airport on May 2, 2021; and Al‑Asad Air Base on May 4 and May 24, 2021.  Recent UAV attacks have included ones on United States facilities in Erbil on April 14, 2021; Al-Asad Air Base on May 8, 2021; Bashur Air Base on May 10, 2021; and United States facilities near the Baghdad International Airport on June 9, 2021.  These attacks have injured and threatened the lives of United States and Coalition personnel.  Additional UAV attacks have been attempted. <br><br>I directed the June 27 strikes in order to protect and defend the safety of our personnel, to degrade and disrupt the ongoing series of attacks against the United States and our partners, and to deter the Islamic Republic of Iran and Iran-backed militia groups from conducting or supporting further attacks on United States personnel and facilities.  In support of these aims, the targeted strikes were directed at facilities used by groups involved in these ongoing attacks for weapons storage, command, logistics, and UAV operations.<br><br>I directed this discrete military action consistent with my responsibility to protect United States citizens both at home and abroad and in furtherance of United States national security and foreign policy interests, pursuant to my constitutional authority to conduct United States foreign relations and as Commander in Chief and Chief Executive.  The United States took this necessary and proportionate action consistent with international law, and in the exercise of the United States&#8217; inherent right of self-defense as reflected in Article 51 of the United Nations Charter.  The United States stands ready to take further action, as necessary and appropriate, to address further threats or attacks. <br><br>I am providing this report as part of my efforts to keep the Congress fully informed, consistent with the War Powers Resolution (Public Law 93-148).  Additional information is provided in a classified annex.  I appreciate the support of the Congress in this action.       </p>



<p class="has-text-align-right"> Sincerely,<br><br>                               JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.</p>

PSAKI:&nbsp; Hi, everyone.&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Good morning.&nbsp; Welcome to our trip to La Crosse, Wisconsin.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>President Biden is traveling today to make the case directly to the American people that the Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework is a major step forward for our country and the largest infrastructure investment in nearly a century.&nbsp; It will grow our economy, create good-paying jobs, and position America to compete with the world and win the 21st century.<br>&nbsp;<br>A couple of Wisconsin specifics: Nearly half of &#8212; nearly half of Milwaukee’s 160,000 water service lines are made of lead, and the plan’s investments in water infrastructure will replace them all.<br>&nbsp;<br>The infrastructure deal will also, as you know, help make broadband access a reality for people across the country.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>There’s 82,000 Wisconsin children who didn’t have access to reliable Internet in the midst of a year of remote schooling.&nbsp; This will help change that.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>It will also help address the bridges and roads, of course, across Wisconsin that need rebuilding as a core part of the Infrastructure Framework.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The place we’re going today &#8212; the place where the President will deliver his remarks &#8212; is the La Crosse Municipal Transit Utility, which was rewarded &#8212; awarded a federal grant in 2018 to purchase two electric buses, charging stations, and related infrastructure. &nbsp;This is part of a broader strategy of the City of La Crosse to achieve a goal of 100 percent renewable energy by 2050.<br>&nbsp;<br>Oh, and just a little full-circle note for all of you: The buses are being manufactured by Proterra, whose Greenville, South Carolina, facility the President visited back in April.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>I also wanted to note that, yesterday, the House took an important step in advancing the vision the President laid out with the American Jobs Plan for growing the economy for all workers by advancing two bipartisan bills: the National Science Foundation for the Future Act and the Department of Energy Science for the Future Act.<br>&nbsp;<br>He was pleased to see the Senate pass crucially important investments in our domestic strength through the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act with massive bipartisan support, and he’s heartened to see the House pass bipartisan investments in science and R&amp;D.<br>&nbsp;<br>Another update on our doses going overseas: We are proud to announce that 2.5 million doses of the Moderna vaccine will begin to ship to Bangladesh today.&nbsp; And we expect we may have more announcements today, as well, for additional shipments.<br>&nbsp;<br>You may have also seen our announcement &#8212; short announcement &#8212; that the President and the First Lady will be traveling to Surfside, Florida.&nbsp; Let me give you a little bit more detail about what they’re planning to do there.&nbsp; They want to thank the heroic first responders, search-and-rescue teams, and everyone who has been working tirelessly around the clock, and meet with the families who have been forced to endure this terrible tragedy &#8212; waiting in anguish and heartbreak for word of their loved ones &#8212; to offer them comfort as search-and- rescue efforts continue.<br>&nbsp;<br>And they want to make sure that state and local officials have the resources and support they need under the emergency declaration approved by the President for Miami-Dade, Florida.<br>&nbsp;<br>The visit is being, of course, closely coordinated with officials on the ground to ensure it does not draw any critical local resources from the ongoing search-and-rescue operations or have any negative operational impact.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And, obviously, I know you’re going to ask about meetings with local officials; we don’t have any updates &#8212; any details on that quite yet.&nbsp; If any develop while we’re on our trip today, we’ll make sure those are available to all of you.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Okay.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; Two-question subject areas.&nbsp; First, Afghanistan.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yes.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The top general in Afghanistan said the escalating violence could lead to a deadly civil war.&nbsp; Does the administration have any concerns about that possibility, given the withdrawals? &nbsp;And what will it do to minimize that possibility?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, first, I would note that the President met with the leaders of Afghanistan just last Friday, and he reiterated our commitment to working with them on not just humanitarian assistance, but security assistance and our commitment to continue to have a presence on the ground, which we vowed to do in the beginning, and we will &#8212; we remain committed to do.<br>&nbsp;<br>I’ll also note that the decision that the President made to withdraw troops from Afghanistan, it is consistent with his view over the last 20 years about the war.&nbsp; But he also made that decision because it was made clear, given the timeline set by the prior administration, that if we did not withdraw our troops, U.S. men and women would be facing fire on the ground.&nbsp; And that was not something, as the Commander-in-Chief, that he felt was acceptable, and hence we are on this timeline we’re on by September.<br>&nbsp;<br>There has been assessments out there, as you know, by the intelligence community and others.&nbsp; I would refer to them on those assessments of the situation on the ground.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, secondly, Tucker Carlson said that the NSA is spying on him.&nbsp; Is the administration aware of any espionage or listening efforts on U.S. citizens by the NSA, and is Tucker Carlson one of them?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, the NSA, as I think you’re well aware &#8212; I’m not sure everyone is aware &#8212; everyone on this plane is aware, I should say &#8212; is an entity that focuses on foreign threats and individuals who are trying &#8212; attempting to do us harm on foreign soil.&nbsp; So, that is the &#8212; their purview.&nbsp; But beyond that, I would point you to the intelligence community.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, on infrastructure: So, Leader McConnell said he was satisfied that the President has de-linked the reconciliation package and the bipartisan agreement, but Speaker Pelosi said this morning that the House isn&#8217;t going to vote on the bipartisan bill until the Senate passes that reconciliation package.&nbsp; So the question is: Is the White House urging her to publicly de-link those two issues like the President did over the weekend?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Our focus is on doing &#8212; the President&#8217;s focus is on doing exactly what he&#8217;s doing today and what leaders in Congress asked him to do, which is to go out to the public and make clear the benefits of this package to the American people, whether it&#8217;s on roads and railways and bridges, or components of the package that there&#8217;s less known about, including making broadband available; making sure we&#8217;re doing environmental remediation, something that would help lower-income communities quite a bit; making public transit available.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s exactly what they expect him to do, what they want him to do, and what the President is going to spend his time doing.&nbsp; He looks forward to and is eager to sign both bills into law, and he will leave it to leaders in Congress to determine the order and the sequencing.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So there&#8217;s no message coming from the White House to Speaker Pelosi to publicly “de-link,” quote unquote, those two issues?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I think the President made clear that he is going to work his heart out getting both bills across the finish line, and that&#8217;s what he&#8217;s going to do, and work closely with leaders in Congress to get that done.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, can you describe the ongoing outreach to progressives today?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You know, to what extent is the White House worried about the idea that all the Democrats in the House won&#8217;t be a “yes” on the reconciliation bill and the compromise (inaudible)?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; Let me give you a rundown of some outreach.&nbsp; It will include progressives but other outreach as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have been &#8212; the White House was in touch with all Democratic chiefs of staff in both chambers yesterday.&nbsp; The White House also had calls with over 60 Democratic and Republican members, chiefs of staff and staff directors in both chambers.&nbsp; This included calls with a diverse &#8212; diverse range of ideologies ranging from members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus to members of the Problem Solvers Caucus.&nbsp;<br>We hosted a call today with all the Democratic &#8212; we are hosting a call today, I should say &#8212; with all of the Democratic Senate communications directors on the package.&nbsp; And today, Steve Ricchetti, Louisa Terrell, and Shuwanza Goff will meet with a range of progressives to moderates within the Democratic House Caucus, as well as Republicans.</p>



<p>In terms of progressive groups &#8212; which is a little beyond this but I think of interest to all of you &#8212; senior White House staffers addressed over 100 progressives groups through a call organized by Build Back Together, focused on the historic progressive wins in the bipartisan framework, including with respect to job creation; climate and clean energy; removing all lead water pipes &#8212; something there isn&#8217;t a lot of information out there on, which we&#8217;re trying to make sure people understand the details of; and connecting all communities to broadband.</p>



<p>We also, separately, addressed 60 additional groups yesterday on a call convened by a different outside organization.</p>



<p>Point being, we have every senior member of the White House working to communicate directly with the public, with groups, with members of Congress about the components of this package and our continued commitment to also get the reconciliation package across the finish line.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What does that say about the fact that this Democratic White House has to do that kind of outreach to members of its own party?&nbsp; I mean, is the President in any way disappointed by the fact that he has to engage this way with fellow Democrats?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; The President sees that as his job and, by association, all of our jobs.&nbsp; And part of what his objective is, at this point, is to move beyond &#8212; and all of our objectives &#8212; move beyond the process.&nbsp; That&#8217;s an important component of it, but make sure we are clearly articulating what the benefits are of these packages, why they can help people, how they can help people in the country, and that&#8217;s something we&#8217;re going to do in partnership with members around the country.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, Bernie Sanders was on NPR this morning talking about the fact that this infrastructure bill doesn&#8217;t include, you know, enough for climate.&nbsp; I know you&#8217;ve said that there are climate provisions in there, but, you know, what do you say to Bernie Sanders when he gets on, you know, national radio and says that?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, first, we say to Senator Sanders: You&#8217;re an important partner, and we look forward to continuing to work with you to get this and the reconciliation package across the finish line.</p>



<p>What we also have been conveying is this &#8212; the President sees this bipartisan package on climate as a down payment.&nbsp; It has a number of key important priorities for anybody who is focused on addressing the climate crisis, including the President, included in it.&nbsp; And that includes environmental remediation.&nbsp; It includes an enormous investment in electric vehicles, electric buses &#8212; something that will not only help communities across the country, you know, better move around, but it will also help our climate.&nbsp; And he is also committed to continuing to work to get more in the bi- &#8212; in the reconciliation package, something that Senator Sanders is certainly running point and leading on.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I guess my other question has to do with the reconciliation package.&nbsp; To what degree, given the amount of effort you&#8217;re having to put into getting the compromise through &#8212; the infrastructure package through &#8212; has there any &#8212; has any real work been done on looking at what you can put into a reconciliation package and win support for?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean, how far is this &#8212; you know, is this effort underway?&nbsp; And who&#8217;s leading that initiative?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, Senator Sanders is leading that initiative, of course, in the Senate.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Inaudible) say?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I would say White House leaders &#8212; the same White House leaders: Steve Ricchetti, Louisa Terrell, others who are &#8212; Shalanda Young, obviously, as our &#8212; as our Acting OMB Director.&nbsp; They have already had meetings.&nbsp; They had a meeting &#8212; I think, last week, we announced &#8212; on the Hill to discuss the next steps and the paths forward.&nbsp; They will have continued meetings over the coming weeks.<br>&nbsp;<br>We have a Jobs Cabinet.&nbsp; We also have a Families Cabinet of members of our &#8212; of our administration who we expect to also be out there communicating about the huge benefits of the Families Plan &#8212; something that will be central to the President&#8217;s push in the reconciliation package as well as his budget that he&#8217;s also put forward.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>We also fully recognize that we&#8217;re at the early stages of this process, and I think anybody on the Hill will tell you that.&nbsp; And there are important discussions that need to happen between a range of Democrats about priorities, what can be in the package, and what they would support.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>We’ll, of course, be engaged in that, but those need to also happen among senators.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What&#8217;s your best guess for timing, in terms of getting &#8212; you know, what &#8212; what&#8217;s your goal, your target to get this legislation passed &#8212; both?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would say that Leader Schumer has conveyed that he wants to have both packages on the floor in July, and that&#8217;s probably the next step.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And tomorrow, you&#8217;ll be meeting with the western governors.&nbsp; So the President will be meeting with the western governors.&nbsp; He met with the FEMA Administrator recently and talked about increasing pay for firefighters and just raising awareness about wildfires.&nbsp; Do you have any specific proposals that you&#8217;re going to be unveiling in terms of how to address this problem?&nbsp; There&#8217;s so many wildfires already.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; You&#8217;re absolutely right.&nbsp; And the President&#8217;s commitment to making sure we&#8217;re being partners &#8212; that the administration and he, personally, is a partner to governors who are looking ahead to a growing wildfire season &#8212; rising heat, rising temperatures in the West &#8212; you know, that&#8217;s something that&#8217;s been important to him personally.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>He already had a briefing from FEMA over the last couple of weeks.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have anything to preview for you yet.&nbsp; We will see if, by the end of the day, we do, in advance of tomorrow.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, on COVID, is the White House having pause on plans to reopen to Canada and Europe because of the Delta strain?&nbsp; Has &#8212; is the &#8212; you know, because it&#8217;s causing some disruption like everywhere, as far away as Australia.&nbsp; Is that, like, getting into the &#8212; putting a fly in the ointment for whatever plans there were to reopen?&nbsp; And when are you going to reopen Canada and Europe?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; As you know, there&#8217;s working groups that are under discussion &#8212; having discussions between our officials and officials in Europe and other countries about what that path forward looks like.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t &#8212; I don&#8217;t have any updates on those groups.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So there&#8217;s no pro- &#8212; there&#8217;s no progress on &#8212; like, (inaudible) Canada?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I didn’t &#8212; I didn&#8217;t actually say that.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I said: We continue to evaluate, through these working groups, what the criteria should be and when it would be safe to reopen.&nbsp; We are working &#8212; we’re guided by our public health officials, but I don&#8217;t have any updates on the timeline at this point.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Jen, I just &#8212; just related to that, is there any update on the mask policy and so on for the barbecue on Sunday?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Oh, the &#8212; sorry, say that one more time.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#8217;m sorry.&nbsp; At the White House barbecue on Sunday &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI: Yes.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; the July the 4th barbecue &#8212; have you &#8212; what are the rules going to be for masks and &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; vaccine and so on?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; There&#8217;s been guidance that has been provided, which may be updated.&nbsp; But to all attendees that include the &#8212; the guidance that they should be &#8212; they should get tested one through three days in advance of coming to the event.&nbsp; If they are vaccinated, of course, they can abide by the public health guidelines that does not require mask wearing.&nbsp; If they have not been vaccinated, they should wear a mask.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, can you talk about the strategy of going to Wisconsin today?&nbsp; Why aren’t we heading to West Virginia or Arizona or some other place where you might be targeting a lawmaker?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, Wisconsin is a place where there &#8212; where the people of the state would hugely benefit from the components of the bipartisan infrastructure package.&nbsp; I mentioned a couple of them at the top, including broadband access &#8212; something that more than 80,000 kids across Wisconsin didn&#8217;t have access to, even while they were getting &#8212; attending school from home.&nbsp; There are bridges across the state that need repair, roads that need repair &#8212; also something that would be beneficial.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>We&#8217;re going to a &#8212; the location we&#8217;re going to, where the President is going to be delivering his remarks, is an interesting example.&nbsp; They purchased two electric vehicles because of an electric &#8212; because of a federal grant &#8212; electric buses, I should say.&nbsp; That&#8217;s something that&#8217;s going to help the City of La Crosse get to a more &#8212; a &#8212; to become a city that is &#8212; can be a model for how you should move to a more climate-friendly approach to transit.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So, this is a place where we felt we could highlight the benefits, talk directly to the Ame- &#8212; American people, people of Wisconsin about why this bipartisan package is a good deal for the American people.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, does the President believe that Americans who live in coastal high rises are safe right now?&nbsp; Or is there anything that &#8212; more that he wants to see being done?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I think, one, the President supports an investigation.&nbsp; I conveyed this yesterday.&nbsp; And I actually didn&#8217;t give the specifics on who would oversee the investigation, so let me just give that to you right now.&nbsp; One second.&nbsp; I have it right in here somewhere.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Okay.&nbsp; So the National Institute of Standards and Technology &#8212; NIST &#8212; is authorized to investigate building failures.&nbsp; Their authorities are modeled after those of the National Transportation Safety Board &#8212; the NTSB &#8212; for investigating transportation accidents.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>They have announced they sent a team of six scientists and engineers to collect firsthand information on the towers &#8212; the Champlain Towers South collapse that will be used to determine if an investigation or study will be conducted.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So, obviously, that would be something the President would support, and certainly we would look to that &#8212; if that&#8217;s a decision made &#8212; to learn how we can help protect infrastructure across the country.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And any reaction to that letter that went out to the residents of the building?&nbsp; We found &#8212; CNN found, in April, that it was warning the occupants of basically the worst possible outcome, which happened.&nbsp; Any &#8212; any reaction?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Again, clearly, we are providing every resource we can from the federal government &#8212; not just to help with the search-and-rescue operations, but to be a part of any effort to determine if an investigation should happen moving forward.&nbsp; That&#8217;s something the President supports, and that&#8217;s a way we can be constructive from the federal government.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, there&#8217;s a report in Politico that suggests that your administration is looking at reversing some of the deportations that happened during the Trump administration.&nbsp; Can you talk about that and maybe whether there&#8217;s any limit to it or how you&#8217;re going through that process?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; That&#8217;s &#8212; I&#8217;d have to talk to our immigration team about that.&nbsp; I have not seen that report, but I will check in with them about it and get you an answer.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, Jen, going back to what we were talking about earlier with infrastructure and Senator McConnell: Senator McConnell, yesterday, claimed he&#8217;s still sort of undecided on whether to vote for this package.&nbsp; Does the White House think getting him to vote for this is a realistic goal?&nbsp; Do you view him as a partner in passing this or as someone who&#8217;s more trying to tank the deal?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Look, I would say that the President would welcome the support from any Republican and Democrat for a bipartisan package that&#8217;s broadly supported by the American people, because the American people don&#8217;t think &#8212; including people in his home state of Kentucky &#8212; that rebuilding roads and railways and bridges is a partisan issue.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not.&nbsp; Neither is making sure people have access to broadband or clean drinking water.<br>&nbsp;<br>That&#8217;s the case the President will continue to make. &nbsp;We’ll lead the &#8212; leave the vote counting and the whip counting to leaders in Congress.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But does the President view McConnell as an ally in trying to get this passed or as someone we need to get past in order to pass it?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; The President and members of the administration will engage with a range of leaders and officials in Congress, including Leader McCon- &#8212; including Senator McConnell.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The German finance minister is coming this week to visit Janet Yellen, and there&#8217;s these OECD tax talks.&nbsp; As you know, this was a subject at the G7.&nbsp; Are you confident that you&#8217;ll &#8212; that the U.S. will be able to prevail with that digital &#8212; you know, with the &#8212; with its view of a global minimum corporate tax of 15 percent?&nbsp; And do you have any, kind of, updates for us as we&#8217;re heading into the G20 process too?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; Beginning of an exciting season: the G20 season.&nbsp; I will say I would certainly leave it to the Department of Treasury for any previews of the Secretary&#8217;s meeting, but I would remind you &#8212; and you were on the trip with us &#8212; that it was, in part, because of U.S. leadership that we got agreement on the global minimum tax at the G7 &#8212; an important step forward and something we knew that there would be continued work that would be required to be done to get that across the finish line.<br>&nbsp;<br>But I would leave it to them for any update on that, as Secretary Yellen is running point and leading that effort.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On housing finance, you had the Supreme Court ruling recently, but we saw, in the Miami condo tower, condos were selling &#8212; they were listed for sale between $600- and $700,000.&nbsp; Does this administration plan to do anything about the shortage of home construction and housing finance to make sure that people can find homes where they can afford and know that their investments will be safe?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Are you asking me about the infrastructure or the cost of housing?<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The cost of housing but, more importantly, the absence of supply and the absence of new construction.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; I would say, first, on the &#8212; we certainly recognize that the absence of certain materials, as you all know, including lumber, has led to price increases in the housing market.&nbsp; And we have been focused on working through our supply chain team that is leading this effort to make sure we are addressing challenges in the supply chain, gaps in the supply chain to make sure that those materials are more readily available.<br>&nbsp;<br>So, yes, we are doing &#8212; we are taking a number of steps as an administration, across the board, to address housing.&nbsp; As you know, there&#8217;s been a one-month extension &#8212; I know this wasn&#8217;t what you were asking, but just an example &#8212; of the eviction moratorium and the foreclosure moratorium.&nbsp; That will help some people in the country stay in their homes for a period of time.&nbsp; That was always meant to be temporary.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>We also are working to see &#8212; to determine how we can address these supply chain issues that have led to increases, because as you know, Josh, from covering this quite closely, the fact that there are not new builds is also raising the prices of houses that have been around for some time, so we&#8217;re seeing kind of a ricocheting effect here.&nbsp; But that is part of our objective.&nbsp; And some of the materials that are &#8212; is being worked through by our economic team.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On this trip, Jen &#8212; so, obviously, President Biden won Wisconsin in 2020, but the area we&#8217;re going to today was more in favor of Donald Trump.&nbsp; I know the next election is a long way off, but does the White House believe winning or getting higher margins in rural areas is important for the President&#8217;s reelection?&nbsp; (Laughter.)<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I would say that what should be noted is that under President Biden&#8217;s leadership, the economy is starting to come back again, and communities across the country &#8212; whether they&#8217;re blue or red parts of the country &#8212; are seeing the benefits of that.&nbsp; And it is &#8212; it should be noted that a range of members of Congress who may be facing reelections are eager to have the President travel to parts of their districts and parts of their &#8212; and their states because of his work on an economic agenda that works for all people, whether they live in red states or blue states or purple states and whomever they may have voted for the last time around.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I just ask on the supply chain stuff?&nbsp; You talked yesterday about Taiwan.&nbsp; You talked yesterday about Taiwan.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And there&#8217;s this critical meeting today on this sort of, you know, trade council with Taiwan.&nbsp; Is there any suggestion at all that the U.S. decision to provide as many vaccine doses as were provided to Taiwan is in some way a quid pro quo to get access to semiconductors from Taiwan?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; There should not be that suggestion.&nbsp; I will note that they were being cut off from access to vaccines.&nbsp; So that was a factor.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, Senator Wyden has what he&#8217;s calling the &#8220;Press Act.&#8221; &nbsp;It has to do with the idea that Justice Department &#8212; the Justice Department is subpoenaing reporters&#8217; business records.&nbsp; Does the White House have a position that it&#8217;s ready to take on that?&nbsp; I know the President has obviously spoken out about how wrong it is that the Justice Department might go after reporters&#8217; records.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah, the President has been pretty clear about what he feels the tactics should not be as it relates to reporters and members of the media. &nbsp;And that is aligned with his long respect for the freedom of press and the freedom of media.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>I&#8217;d have to look into this.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a piece of legislation.&nbsp; I&#8217;d have to look into the specifics of the piece of legislation.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; Thank you.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; All right.&nbsp; Thanks, everyone.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>11:49 A.M. EDT</p>
