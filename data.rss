<p class="has-text-align-center">James S. Brady Press Briefing Room</p>



<p>3:31 P.M. EST</p>



<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Hi, everyone.&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Happy Monday.&nbsp; State of the Union eve, shall we say?&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; I just wanted to get &#8212; start off and give you &#8212; highlight some of the ongoing assistance &#8212; obviously, we made a number of announcements over the weekend &#8212; to get everybody up to speed.&nbsp; We have some charts to give you all the specifics, in case that is helpful.</p>



<p>The United States is the largest provider of assistance to Ukraine, and President Biden has committed more security assistance to Ukraine over the past year than the United States has provided at any other time in history.</p>



<p>On Friday night, the President authorized an additional $350 million of military assistance in support of Ukraine’s frontline defenders as they face armored, airborne, and other threats.&nbsp; He did so hours after speaking with President Zelenskyy to ask him what support he needed.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are working to expedite deliveries from the latest package the President approved &#8212; I would note that the prior package that we had already announced has been ongoing and &#8212; and has been delivered, even in the last few days &#8212; parts of that &#8212; of that package.&nbsp; We expect equipment to start arriving within the next couple of days from this package.</p>



<p>That brought the total security assistance we’ve approved for Ukraine to $1 billion over the past year.&nbsp; It is the third time the President has expedited emergency security assistance for Ukraine’s defense in recent months using the Presidential Drawdown Authority.&nbsp; We’re also working with NATO Allies to facilitate the transfer of U.S.-made equipment from their inventories to Ukraine.</p>



<p>The United States is also the largest &#8212; the single-largest provider of humanitarian assistance to Ukraine and recently deployed a Disaster Assistance Response Team to the region to lead the U.S. humanitarian response and support the Ukrainian people as they bear the brunt of Russian aggression.</p>



<p>You may have seen that our USAID &#8212; head of USAID, Samantha Power, is on the ground in Poland and has been there as well, providing guidance and assistance there.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have provided over $106 million in humanitarian assistance to Ukraine in the past year, including an additional $54 million we announced this weekend to cover critical needs such as safe drinking water, sanitation, hygiene supplies, and critical emergency health supplies to meet the needs of hundreds of thousands of people, as well as emergency food assistance to meet the immediate needs of 125,000 people.</p>



<p>I will stop there.&nbsp; I know there’s lots to talk about, so, Aamer, why don’t you kick us off?<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; In light of President Putin putting Russia&#8217;s nuclear forces into &#8220;special combat readiness,&#8221; has the United States changed its nuclear posture?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, let me first start by saying that throughout the crisis, Russia and President Putin have falsely alleged that it is under threat, including from Ukraine, including from NATO.&nbsp; Neither the United States nor NATO has any desire or intention for conflict with Russia.&nbsp; And we think provocative rhetoric like this regarding nuclear weapons is dangerous, adds to the risk of miscalculation, should be avoided, and we’ll not indulge in it.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are assessing President Putin&#8217;s directive and, at this time, we see no reason to change our own alert levels.&nbsp; But it&#8217;s also important to remember that, even over the course of the last several months and years, when we have had significant disagreements with Russia over a range of issues, Russia and the United States have long agreed that nuclear use would have devastating consequences and have stated many times, including earlier this year, that a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So we have not &#8212; had seen reason to change our alert levels, and we are &#8212; see obvious, significant danger in escalatory rhetoric.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I ask &#8212; there’s been a great deal of movement of unity, and it comes after no shortage of angst about the Western Alliance, I think, in recent years, particularly going back to the last administration.&nbsp; Is the President going to use this moment, though, to push NATO members to get on track with that 2 percent of GDP on defense spending?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, President Putin has been one of the greatest unifiers of NATO in modern history, so I guess that is one thing we can thank him for.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I would just look at, Aamer, some of the announcements that have been made even over the last couple of days.&nbsp; One, the President has always been an advocate and a supporter of countries abiding by the 2 percent component.&nbsp; He was a supporter of that back when he was Vice President, where, for history’s sake, there was a great deal of progress made before the last president even took office and talked about it.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But as we look even over the past &#8212; course of the past weekend, not only did you see a NATO Alliance that was incredibly unified and agreement among Europeans that there needed to be additional assistance provided in the form of security assistance to Ukraine, but you saw a number of countries take steps that they had not taken in recent history.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Germany has historically not sent weapons to conflict zones; this weekend, they changed course.&nbsp; Sweden also has not changed &#8212; sent arms to countries in active conflict; that changed this weekend.&nbsp; Finland also changed course.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not all NATO members, of course, but the point is: What you&#8217;re looking at here is a unified Europe, a unified West, a unified NATO who are standing up to the aggression and the invasion led by President Putin.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And if I could just quickly follow up on that, we&#8217;ve also seen some signs and responses beyond sanctions to isolate Russia.&nbsp; I think FIFA &#8212; and I’m sorry, I’m not a soccer fan &#8212; I think it’s &#8220;FIFA,&#8221; how you pronounce it &#8212; and the IOC have taken action to put pressure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Can that type of pressure &#8212; is it sustainable in the long term, given the economic pressures?&nbsp; The longer this crisis goes on, can you maintain that sort of unity and those sort of collective actions?&nbsp; Can they continue beyond this early moment?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well &#8212; and you&#8217;re referring to the IOC, as in the International Olympic Committee?<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; And I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s &#8220;Fie-fa&#8221; or &#8220;FIFA.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FIFA.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; FIFA.&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; I kind of &#8212;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I apologize to the international community.&nbsp; (Laughter.)<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; &#8212; I tried to be soft there.&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; FIFA.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Look, I think, Aamer, obviously the preference of everybody is for President Putin to take de-escalatory steps.&nbsp; That is everybody&#8217;s preference.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But as it relates to unity among international organizations, among the West, among countries, among many leaders in the United States even, I think what we&#8217;ve seen over the last few days is a commitment to remain united and to send a strong message to President Putin that this act &#8212; these actions, this rhetoric is unacceptable and the world is building a wall against it.</p>



<p>Go ahead.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia had a call with Emmanuel Macron yesterday where he reiterated the commitment for OPEC Plus’s production agreement.&nbsp; Has there been an explicit U.S. request to Saudi or to members of OPEC Plus to increase production, given what&#8217;s happening right now?<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, without getting into specific details from here, just because it wouldn&#8217;t be constructive to our overarching objectives, we have been in touch.&nbsp; I think you may remember that Brett McGurk and Amos Hochstein made a trip to the region just a few weeks ago to have conversations with the Saudis and others about a range of topics, including the conflict in Yemen, but also to have a conversation about the need to address any impact on the global markets &#8212; global oil markets that we expect could happen &#8212; expected at the time could happen and could continue to happen as a result of President Putin&#8217;s invasion.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But was any request made for a specific production increase?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Again, there is a &#8212; there has been an ongoing discussion about steps that we can all take as a global community to address any volatility in the market.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then given, I think, the speed and scale of the ramp-up on the sanction side of things over the course of the last 72 hours, does the U.S., European Allies have a &#8212; like, a threshold for which they view if you cross this, it would be viewed as an act of war by President Putin?&nbsp; As in, how do you calibrate your actions in terms of response and what may be coming back?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, he was &#8212; he&#8217;s already in a war &#8212; committed an act of war, invaded a sovereign country.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean for NATO countries or EU countries.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Oh, you mean for NATO countries to act further, in terms of further military steps or further sanctions?<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As in, if you game out &#8212; as you game out what a response would be, given the scale of the sanctions package &#8212;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; that was unveiled, is there a line that if we do this sanction or if we go this far, then that would for sure draw a response directly towards the U.S. or towards the EU from Russia?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, if you look at the significance of the steps we&#8217;ve taken to date, including the announcements over the weekend about cutting off major financial &#8212; major fin- &#8212; banks in Russia from the SWIFT banking system, we have continued to escalate and build in close coordination and alignment with the Europeans.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unity is a top principle for President Biden as we take steps forward.&nbsp; That doesn&#8217;t happen on its own.&nbsp; It doesn&#8217;t happen by accident.&nbsp; It happens as a result of a lot of conversations, diplomacy, and hours by the President and others on his national security team behind the scenes.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the other piece, just to get to the core of your question, that we very much weigh is maximizing the impact on President Putin, the Russian elite, the economy while minimizing it on the global markets and the American people.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, as we look at steps to take &#8212; I mean, even if you look at the impact on the energy sector, you know, we have &#8212; we have taken steps &#8212; we have not taken some steps on energy sanctions, in part because we weigh that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That doesn&#8217;t mean that they&#8217;re off the table.&nbsp; That remain &#8212; they remain on the table.&nbsp; But Europeans, for example, are very concerned about further price spikes on gas, in particular.&nbsp; Their prices have gone up 335 percent over the last three &#8212; yes, over the last year and 26 percent over the last five days.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So sanctioning energy would affect Russia&#8217;s income stream &#8212; certainly that would be a reason to do it &#8212; but it would also have extreme consequences on the world energy markets, particularly for our Allies in Europe.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, I use that as an example because we have to weigh all of the factors as we weigh whether to take additional steps.&nbsp; We have additional steps we could take, but we consider all of those factors as we make determinations.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, last one, just real quick: Is the Biden administration considering following what the EU and Canada did in barring Russian flights from the U.S. at any point?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have anything to update you on, on that front at this point in time.&nbsp; There are obviously a range of &#8212; of options that remain on the table.&nbsp; So, it&#8217;s not off the table, but I don&#8217;t have anything to announce and no decision made.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Go ahead.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.&nbsp; You spoke about &#8212; a little bit about the sanctions that were announced over the weekend &#8212;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; on Russia’s Central Bank.&nbsp; How long does the U.S. anticipate keeping them in place?&nbsp; I mean, is there sort of a timeframe there?&nbsp; Perhaps &#8212; you spoke about, you know, Russia considering de-escalatory tactics or, you know, maybe announcing a ceasefire.&nbsp; Or, you know, is there &#8212; is there, sort of, a broad timeframe that the U.S. is thinking about?<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, let&#8217;s hope that&#8217;s the discussion we&#8217;re having.&nbsp; Obviously, right now, President Putin is continuing to take escalatory steps, so we&#8217;re not at that point of having that discussion.&nbsp; We hope that&#8217;s one that we will be a part of.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; So, for the time being, there is, sort of, no discussion on perhaps, you know, putting an end to the sanctions that have been put in place?<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I mean, President Putin and the Russian military is moving toward the capital of Ukraine, and there are hundreds of thousands of refugees leaving the country because he has invaded a sovereign country.&nbsp; So, no, I would not say we&#8217;re talking about reducing sanctions at this point in time.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, sorry, one quick question on President Zelenskyy saying he wants to be a member of the European Union.&nbsp; We did see some comments come in from the EU over the weekend saying they are a part of us.&nbsp; However, this morning, there were some conflicting comments again from the EU saying, you know, there are, sort of, discussions among EU members about, you know, whether such a decision can be made.&nbsp; What is the U.S. position on Ukraine joining the EU?&nbsp; Do you support it?<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; It’s up to the European Union.&nbsp; We’re not a member of the European Union.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If they did consider taking Ukraine in, would you support that?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; It&#8217;s up to the European Union to make that decision.&nbsp; There&#8217;s a process.</p>



<p>And, of course, we support the aspirations of any country to join any organization and the decision of that organization to make a decision.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go ahead.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; President Zelenskyy is urging President Biden and NATO to impose this no-fly zone.&nbsp; You&#8217;ve said that this would significantly escalate the situation.&nbsp; So, just to be clear: Is this a no go for right now, or is this completely off the table &#8212; something that you would not consider?<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, the President has been very clear that he is not intending to send U.S. troops to fight a war with Russia.&nbsp; And I think what&#8217;s important to note here is that is essentially what this would be a step toward, because a no-fly zone would require implementation.&nbsp; It would require deploying U.S. military to enforce, which would be a direct conflict &#8212; potentially a direct conflict and potentially war with Russia, which is something we are not planning to be a part of.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And on Vladimir Putin, you’ve said, you know, you&#8217;re not going to assess his mental state, but the President has said, you know, he knows Putin well.&nbsp; They&#8217;ve talked a few times over the last several weeks and months.&nbsp; Has the President himself noticed or commented on any change that he&#8217;s picked up on in Putin&#8217;s demeanor or tone?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have anything &#8212; any more assessment about the President&#8217;s view of President Putin&#8217;s mental acuity to state from here.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There&#8217;s no question &#8212; outside of that, we&#8217;ll leave that to others &#8212; that what we&#8217;ve seen from President Putin, whether it is escalatory rhetoric as it relates to nuclear capabilities and nuclear intentions &#8212; something that is in direct conflict with something President Putin, himself, and the Russians committed to &#8212; had an alternate &#8212; you know, committed to something else just a year ago, or whether it is the speech he gave last week where he questioned the sovereignty of the country of Ukraine at all, or the actions he&#8217;s taking right now.&nbsp; Those are not actions of a &#8212; of a global leader that &#8212; that that should be treated with respect on the global stage.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But given the behavior that you have seen, some of the things that you just noted, and the very severe consequences that he is now facing &#8212; these severe sanctions &#8212; is there any concern that instead of retreating that Putin will feel so squeezed and so pressured that he will lash out even more, intensifying his attacks &#8212; that any of this could backfire, essentially?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I think that it is our responsibility &#8212; the United States, President Biden as a leader in the world &#8212; to rally the world in making clear how unacceptable his behavior is and to put in place severe consequences.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now what he is feeling on the ground &#8212; there are protests, there have been oligarchs in his own cozy circle who have been outspoken.&nbsp; And obviously, the pinch is being felt significantly in the Russian economy, even if you just look at the fact that the market was closed today.&nbsp; The ruble has been plummeting.&nbsp; So those are the ways that he is feeling this.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He has a decision he can make to de-escalate.&nbsp; And certainly, we would welcome that decision.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; Does the White House believe it is possible to say whether Ukraine or Russia are winning this war right now?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;re going to make an assessment of that from here.&nbsp; But what I will reiterate is something we have said in the past, is that: President Putin and Russian military have made clear that they have every intention of taking over the capital city.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While it &#8212; while there has been a greater pushback in the country than they may have assessed to begin with, and I know my colleagues at the Department of Defense have spoken to this &#8212; the Ukrainian military, President Zelenskyy, and others, have fought courageously, have fought boldly in this moment &#8212; they are continuing to proceed, continuing to move towards the capital.&nbsp; So, I don&#8217;t think their ambitions have changed.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What would Putin have to do to get these sanctions lifted?&nbsp; Would he have to agree to a ceasefire?&nbsp; Would he have to pull all of his troops out of Ukraine?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I&#8217;m not going to make a prediction or assessment of that from here.&nbsp; If he starts to take the de-escalatory steps, I&#8217;m sure we can have that conversation.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How great is the concern &#8212; this is sort of building on Mary&#8217;s question: How great is the concern that these sanctions are so punishing that, essentially, Putin will have nothing left to lose and no offramp?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, the sanctions are punishing so that they will inflict significant consequences and change the outcome at the end of the day &#8212; and de-escalate at the end of the day.&nbsp; That is what they are intended to do.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, you were talking about a no-fly zone over Ukraine, but I know officials have been discussing the possibility of imposing a no-fly zone for Russia over the U.S.&nbsp; Where do those talks stand right now and what are the pros and cons to doing something like that?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, while &#8212; while no option is off the table, there &#8212; I don&#8217;t have anything to preview for you in terms of a decision or anything along those lines.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I would note that there are a lot of flights that go over &#8212; that &#8212; that U.S. &#8212; U.S. airlines fly over Russia to go to Asia and other parts of the world, and we factor in a range of factors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, finally, what&#8217;s the U.S. doing to reduce the possibility of nuclear war?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I think, one, we are not escalating our own rhetoric.&nbsp; Two, we are certainly assessing what President Putin&#8217;s comments mean.&nbsp; But, as I noted a little bit earlier, we have not changed our own posture.&nbsp; What we are trying to do is reduce the tension; take the &#8212; the tenor of the rhetoric down; and make clear that we have seen this pattern in the past, which is posing threats or suggesting, through misinformation of sorts, that there are threats posed to President Putin in Russia that don&#8217;t exist.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; There are reports of illegal cluster bombs and vacuum bombs being used by the Russians.&nbsp; If that&#8217;s true, what is the next step of this administration?&nbsp; And is there a red line for how much violence will be tolerated against civilians in this manner that&#8217;s illegal and potentially a war crime?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; It is &#8212; it would be.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have any confirmation of that.&nbsp; We have seen the reports. &nbsp;If that were true, it would potentially be a war crime.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Obviously, there are a range of international fora that would assess that.&nbsp; So, certainly, we would look to that to be a part of that conversation.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, the new aid that you just laid out at the beginning here.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Post reported over the weekend that this aid will not include Stingers, that it would likely come in a future batch of aid.&nbsp; What is the reason for that?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I&#8217;m not going to get into specifics of what is in the military package.&nbsp; It is &#8212; it is a combination of ground and airborne defense capabilities.&nbsp; And, obviously, we have provided those in the past, but I&#8217;m not going to have more details &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; &#8212; to outline for you from here.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; you mentioned that this next batch is going to be coming in the next few days.&nbsp; Why so long?&nbsp; I mean, &#8220;days&#8221; doesn&#8217;t sound like a long time to us, but &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; The package that we had and already announced continues to be delivered. &nbsp;So, we have expedited the plans for delivery of this new package.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then on the nuclear rhetoric we&#8217;ve been hearing from Putin: Does this influence at all the upcoming Nuclear Policy Review?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; In terms of how we &#8212; our relationship with &#8212; look, I would say &#8212; it&#8217;s a good question, Jacqui.&nbsp; But I would say what&#8217;s important for people to note &#8212; and this is why I noted it a little bit earlier &#8212; is that even at moments where we had huge tension with President Putin and Russia around the 2016 election, around the invasion of Georgia, around their prior invasion of Ukraine, it was agreed that escalatory rhetoric around nuclear ambitions was dangerous.&nbsp; And that was something we committed to with Russia not to pursue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, you know, we &#8212; I think, for right now, we&#8217;re going to remind the global community of those commitments.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And on that same note, does this administration trust Russia to be an honest broker in the talks with Iran right now?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I think it&#8217;s not about trust in any of these negotiations or discussions; it&#8217;s about verifying and then trusting later, including with the Iranians.&nbsp; But the Russians have been, in the past, a part of the P5+1 negotiations.&nbsp; They’re a part of it now.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I would &#8212; I would &#8212; I would just convey that, you know, it is in everyone&#8217;s interest to have an understanding and visibility into Iran&#8217;s capacity to acquire a nuclear weapon.&nbsp; There&#8217;s no question about that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, at this point, we&#8217;re just &#8212; we&#8217;re just continuing to work &#8212; hope to make progress on that agreement.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then after all of this, what is the stance of the U.S. and buying Russian gas at this point?&nbsp; At this point, are we ready to pledge not to buy any more Russian gas?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, as you know, it&#8217;s really &#8212; let me give you actually kind of an update on this because it&#8217;s a &#8212; it&#8217;s &#8212; I think there&#8217;s been a little confusion.&nbsp; One moment.</p>



<p>So, as it relates to Russian gas, the U.S. government doesn&#8217;t dictate where the U.S. market sells our own oil and gas products nor where it acquires crude or refined products from for domestic consumption.&nbsp; This is all up to the private sector, other than exceptions like countries under sanctions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, the U.S. refiners currently importing Russian products are largely legacy refinery operations tooled in Hawaii and Alaska for certain supplies because of geography; and imports to the Gulf, both of certain refined products and of crude, as refiners in the Gulf mix crude supplies to meet the needs of their particular refinery designs.</p>



<p>There have been companies &#8212; obviously, private sector companies &#8212; who have made decisions and announcements, and we certainly applaud that.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, can you just explain, though, what you laid out at the beginning because I&#8217;m a little bit unclear.&nbsp; You just &#8212; just in layman&#8217;s terms: We are not going to be making any policy from the U.S. government that would prohibit the sale or the purchase of Russian gas then because it&#8217;s not something that we already do?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We haven&#8217;t ruled out that, but I think what I wanted to convey is what is accurate about what happens now and how it currently works.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, thank you.&nbsp; Staying on that topic for a moment &#8212; of oil and gas.&nbsp; You have said “nothing is off the table” when it comes to releasing more reserves, more barrels from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.&nbsp; Where are those negotiations right now?&nbsp; Is the administration closer to moving forward with that, given the sanctions and what we&#8217;re seeing?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have anything to preview for you on that front.&nbsp; It remains an option on the table and, obviously, it would help meet any supply issues in the marketplace.&nbsp; There are conversations that we&#8217;ve been having with global partners.&nbsp; And obviously, we have our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve stockpile to tap into.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you characterize if you’re closer to making a decision on that front though, given what we are seeing and obviously the global impact that these very harsh sanctions (inaudible)?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; It has remained on the table.&nbsp; I just don&#8217;t have anything to predict for you at this point in time.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Just a short time ago, the President was asked by our colleagues here if Americans should be concerned about a nuclear threat.&nbsp; He said very firmly, “No.”&nbsp; Can you explain what gives him that confidence?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Because, as I said a little bit earlier, while we think provocative rhetoric regarding nuclear weapons is dangerous and adds to the risk of miscalculation and should be avoided &#8212; which we&#8217;re not going to indulge in &#8212; we are continuing to assess President Putin&#8217;s directive and, at this time, we see no reason to change our own alert levels.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve also seen, throughout this crisis, President Putin falsely allege that they are under threat and use that as a predicate for taking more aggressive action.&nbsp; So, we assess &#8212; we have our own capacities and capabilities here, but nuclear war cannot be won.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And what everybody should be doing around the world is taking steps to reduce the rhetoric, reduce the tension, and that&#8217;s certainly what our objective is.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One breaking news development that I wanted to ask you about.&nbsp; The U.S. has expelled 12 diplomats &#8212; 12 Russian diplomats.&nbsp; The Russian ambassador just said a short time ago that move was a “hostile step” toward Russia.&nbsp; Can you give us the thinking behind the decision?&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, again, following up on some of the lines of questioning that you&#8217;ve already gotten, could there be a backlash to this step?&nbsp; Is this escalatory?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, let me first state that today’s action has been in the works for several months.&nbsp; We informed &#8212; the United States informed the United Nations and the Russian Mission to the United Nations that we were beginning the process of expelling 12 intelligence operatives from the Russian Mission who had abused their privileges of residency in the United States by engaging in espionage activities that are adverse to our national security.&nbsp; So, it takes some time to make those evaluations and that &#8212; again, those actions were &#8212; were in the works for months.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And your response to the Russian ambassador who called this a “hostile act”?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I think the hostile act is committing espionage activities on our own soil.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, Jen, just finally, on the issue of refugees &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; you have also said &#8212; you were asked by my colleague earlier today whether the administration would move to give refugees from Ukraine protective status.&nbsp; Can you give us a timeline for that?&nbsp; These are people who are suffering, and they want to know what the answer is.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I think, to be clear: Temporary Protected Status applies to people currently living in the United States.&nbsp; Right?&nbsp; So that, I think, is one of the questions &#8212; a good question &#8212; that has been asked.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have any update on that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That&#8217;s a process that&#8217;s run by the Department of Homeland Security.&nbsp; They evaluate, through an interagency process, both what everybody&#8217;s recommendations are and, obviously, the conditions on the ground in Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The second piece is whether we would accept refugees.&nbsp; Yes, we would.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But I think it&#8217;s important to note that the vast majority of refugees are going to want &#8212; in our assessment and through the discussion with refugee agencies, with other countries in the region &#8212; will want to be in Europe and neighboring countries, many of whom have already conveyed very clearly that they will welcome refugees in.&nbsp; Many of them have family members there.&nbsp; Many have work there.&nbsp; So, we are also coordinating and supporting those efforts as well.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.&nbsp; The U.S. has authorized the departure of non-emergency employees and diplomats’ relatives from the embassy in Moscow.&nbsp; How confident is the administration that the U.S. Embassy in Moscow can remain open in the long term?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I can&#8217;t make an assessment of that.&nbsp; That&#8217;s something the State Department looks at and assesses.&nbsp; Obviously, our &#8212; our embassies and consulates around the world play an incredibly important role in communicating with American citizens who are in a country, but also with the Russian people.&nbsp; And so that is something &#8212; that&#8217;s why we have a diplomatic pres- &#8212; you know, consulates in and around the world, including in Russia.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are also decisions that are made for a range of reasons &#8212; the State Department could outline it more specifically for you &#8212; including temporary departure.&nbsp; It&#8217;s something that has happened around the world for many, many decades for a variety of reasons.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I would, you know, give you an example of: Just a couple of years ago in Turkey, there was ordered departure, right?&nbsp; Then diplomats return.&nbsp; That&#8217;s obviously the objective, but it really depends on the conditions on the ground.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And what level of concern is there for the safety of American citizens who are living in Russia?&nbsp; Is there concern that they could face retaliation in light of this conflict?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Again, I would point you to the State Department.&nbsp; They do assessments, and they give clear guidance to people who are on the ground and what their recommendations are for their security.&nbsp; I would note that one difficulty, right now in Russia because of these sanctions, is of gaining access to U.S. currency and using banking cards.&nbsp; And that is a hindrance for many people who are living there right now.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And just, lastly, you know, you&#8217;ve been very clear that the President does not have any intention to deploy U.S. troops to engage militarily in this conflict.&nbsp; But would you say that there is any particular red line that this administration has that would necessitate military action?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; As in sending our U.S. military into Ukraine?&nbsp; The President has no plans to send U.S. military to fight a war in Ukraine against Russia.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you share any details about what came out of the President&#8217;s secure call with other Allied nations this afternoon?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; I know we were working on a readout, which we will get to you shortly after the briefing.&nbsp; It&#8217;s been a bit of a busy day, so let me venture to get that to you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The purpose of this call was for the President to have an opportunity to continue to engage with other leaders about what we&#8217;re seeing on the ground, the range of assistance we&#8217;re providing, the financial sanctions and economic consequences steps we&#8217;re taking, and ensure we remain closely coordinated.&nbsp; But I will see if there&#8217;s more details we can get you.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; And then administration officials earlier this &#8212; earlier today had a background briefing with reporters about the State of the Union coming up.&nbsp; Can you tell us a little bit more?&nbsp; We understand &#8212; or we understood from the call that the President will be addressing elements of the Build Back Better plan when it comes to things like childcare and paid family leave.&nbsp; And officials talked about how those things, if implemented, will lower costs for families, but they were hesitant to use the word “inflation” or say whether that would be addressed directly in the President&#8217;s speech.&nbsp; So can you say whether the President will be addressing any new policies &#8212; not necessarily new domestic programs but policies that would address inflation directly?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, first, let me say, the President will absolutely use the word “inflation” tomorrow, and he will talk about inflation in his speech.&nbsp; Of course, that is a huge issue on the minds of Americans.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, one thing to note is one of the best, most important steps that the Senate could take is to confirm his slate of eminently qualified nominees to fill out the Federal Reserve Board, given they &#8212; given they have a very important role as it relates to inflation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I think what you will hear the President talk about &#8212; and I think this is what they were talking about on this call &#8212; is how we&#8217;re going to address costs for the American people and lower costs.&nbsp; And we talked a lot about inflation in here, our economists talk about inflation, the Federal Reserve talks about inflation &#8212; hugely important.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How people experience it is what it means for their pocketbooks, for their budgets, for their bank accounts, and how they&#8217;re paying for things.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s why a lot of what you&#8217;re going to hear about tomorrow, as he talks about it, is how he&#8217;s going to reduce costs.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, the Build Back &#8212; you know, parts of his agenda that have &#8212; that he has talked about significantly &#8212; a lot over the course of the last several months &#8212; lowering costs for childcare, lowering costs for eldercare, lowering costs for prescription drugs &#8212; those are not done yet.&nbsp; So he will reiterate his call for Congress to move forward on those.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I would also note that, in the speech, he&#8217;s going to make clear that one of the best ways to lower costs over the long run is to &#8212; is to increase the productive capacity of our economy, to make more things in America with more American workers contributing and earning a good living.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He&#8217;s going to describe the emerging manufacturing comeback with American companies betting on America again because of the administration&#8217;s commitment to domestic industrial revitalization and technological development.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He will also call on &#8212; he will also explain that we can also lower costs by promoting fair competition in the U.S. economy.&nbsp; And there are new steps to lower &#8212; and he will talk about steps to lower consumer prices and level the playing field for American businesses in ocean shipping and new steps to protect seniors and other nursing home residents by cracking down on unsafe nursing homes.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And he&#8217;s also going to talk about &#8212; reflect on one of the strongest labor market recoveries in American history and make clear that it&#8217;s important to continue to take steps to eliminate barriers to good-paying jobs for workers across America.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I would expect that you will hear a lot, the American people will hear a lot about how he&#8217;s going to lower their costs, how he&#8217;s going to buil- &#8212; continue to build a strong economy over the long term.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I could just follow up on what you were saying about addressing lowering costs for families &#8212; the President has been encouraging Congress to pass at least elements or his entire Build Back Better agenda for months; Congress has been negotiating for months.&nbsp; What gives the President any confidence that this time around things would be more likely to pass, given we are just months out from midterm elections?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Because there is strong support across the country for lowering costs for prescription drugs.&nbsp; It&#8217;s incredibly popular.&nbsp; Who wants to pay more for prescription drugs?&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know why that gets to be a Democratic idea, but we&#8217;ll &#8212; we&#8217;re happy to own that one.&nbsp; Or for lowering the cost of childcare, for lowering the cost of eldercare and healthcare.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There&#8217;s also strong support for those &#8212; those items and those priorities and those good ideas in &#8212; in the Senate among Senate Democrats.&nbsp; So he&#8217;s going to keep pressing to get it done, and he thinks the American people want us to get it done.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, just on Ukraine.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the past 72 hours or so, there have been a series of announcements that have come on aiding Ukraine or punishing Russia.&nbsp; But it has appeared that Europe has taken the lead on many of these announcements, and I can go through a few of them if you want.&nbsp; But the brunt of my question is I know &#8212; whether you can explain whether there&#8217;s a deliberate strategy right now in this moment to have Europeans and European nations and European leaders being the ones out front on punishing Russia or supporting Ukraine?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would say first that the SWIFT banking system is a European system.&nbsp; So, in terms of the steps that would be taken, it would be only natural for those steps to be taken or announced by them.&nbsp; It is something we have clearly been long open to, but I just wanted to state that from the beginning.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would also say that, you know, the &#8212; the President and the United States has been leading this effort around the world in building this coalition, which includes many countries in Europe but also many from other parts of the world, in standing up to President Putin and standing up to the aggression and the invasion of Ukraine.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so, all of this coordinated action did not happen by accident.&nbsp; It wouldn&#8217;t have happened without the President&#8217;s efforts, the President&#8217;s time he spent on diplomacy, the time of our national security team.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The order of announcements and how that has gone, I would not overread into that because we would not be here had the President not been leading this effort around the world for months.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I think you just saw, you know, over the weekend in particular, this sort of onslaught of news and, sort of, changing posture in Europe, and the President was not &#8212; not present at all in the, sort of, like, you know, living rooms of the American people.&nbsp; You know, we were seeing newscasts of these vacuum bombs and whatnot, but no sort of visual image of the President taking &#8212; you know, doing the kind of behind-the-scenes leadership that you just described.&nbsp; And I do wonder if that is on purpose or if that just happens to be the way the schedule worked.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, the President was at a memorial service for a family member yesterday, and he was with the family on Saturday.&nbsp; And so that was his priority this weekend &#8212; or one of his priorities this weekend.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He also, though, engaged in a meeting with his national security team, and I think you saw him quite visible last week and again today &#8212; well, I guess you know about his call he had today &#8212; and he will continue to, in the days ahead, lead the world in not only building the coalition but pushing for agreement and a coordinated effort to hold Russia accountable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I would say this weekend, he had some personal family reasons &#8212; an important one: a memorial service for a family member &#8212; as to why he was not giving a speech yesterday.&nbsp; But he is somebody who has been leading this effort behind the scenes for months.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And on that front, if you could just preview, for a minute &#8212; the call earlier today was very focused on the President&#8217;s economic agenda, and if you could talk a little bit about what the President may say and how he will, you know, frame this &#8212; this moment and, sort of, this international crises, and the extent to which he sees this a, you know, global audience, you know, more so than it normally would be in a State of the Union.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; Well, first I would say that there&#8217;s no question that this speech is a little different than it would have been just a few months ago.&nbsp; And there&#8217;s always national security in every State of the Union speech, but every State of the Union speech also reflects a moment of time.&nbsp; And so, the President will lay out the efforts we are taking, he has taken, he has led on to rally the world to stand up for democracy and against Russian aggression.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He will talk about the steps we&#8217;ve taken to not only support the Ukrainian people with military and economic assistance but also the steps he&#8217;s taken to build a glo- &#8212; global alition [coalition]&nbsp; imposing crippling financial sanctions on President Putin, his inner circle, and the Russian economy.&nbsp; And he will talk about the steps he&#8217;s taking to mitigate the impact of President Putin&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine on the global economy and the American people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And certainly, you know, I think people can expect to hear him, you know, position that as the importance of the United States as a leader in the world &#8212; standing up for values, standing up for &#8212; for global norms, but also, you know, the efforts that he has undertaken to mitigate how it will impact people here.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I just have one other quick one.&nbsp; But, again, based on the background briefing earlier today about the State of the Union &#8212; it focused on the economy and various programs that the President wants Congress to push.&nbsp; Could you characterize what percentage of the programs that the President will talk about are just a repackaged parts of Build Back Better &#8212; like chunks that he wants to see the Congress pass versus like brand new ideas that he&#8217;s introducing for the first time tomorrow night?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, here&#8217;s what I will tell you, having been through a few State of the Unions in the past, and I know you have as well: They don&#8217;t get longer, they get shorter.&nbsp; Nobody wants a two- or three-hour State of the Union.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t think anyone in here does.&nbsp; So I just don&#8217;t want to preview more at this point in time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can certainly expect to hear him talk about some &#8212; call on Congress to send bills to his desk that deliver progress on ideas that have historically been supported by Democrats and Republicans.&nbsp; Some of those are economic and some of those are in other areas that could just impact and help communities across the country.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And you will certainly hear him call, as you &#8212; as you touched on, for a continued effort &#8212; a redoubling of the effort to move forward on steps that will reduce costs for the American people in these key areas of childcare, healthcare, prescription drugs.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, you know, stay tuned for tomorrow night.&nbsp; But we have a lot of hours between the speech, and I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll have more previews between now and then.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; Just staying on the State of the Union topic.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you talk a little bit about what &#8212; what it would look like, in terms of masking or what you expect it could look like in terms of masking?&nbsp; Specifically, this &#8212; is the President &#8212; will he walk in, shake hands?&nbsp; Will he be wearing a mask when he walks in?</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, he will certainly not be wearing a mask when he&#8217;s speaking.&nbsp; I have not talked to him yet about whether he&#8217;s going to wear a mask when he&#8217;s walking down the aisle.&nbsp; But it has been announced, I think, that it&#8217;s not required, and certainly he will abide by that.&nbsp; But I will see if there&#8217;s more we can report out to you on that later today.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Was it important to the President that masks come off dur- &#8212; before the State of the Union?&nbsp; Is there a message that he hopes to send with &#8212; you know, with that news?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would say the President is very powerful, but he couldn&#8217;t make us be in the green zone that we&#8217;re in right now in D.C.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why we are not required &#8212; we&#8217;re not going to be required to wear a mask starting tomorrow.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I would say that for him, it had nothing to do with the timing around the State of the Union.&nbsp; He wanted to give the CDC the time to assess and make recommendations that would be clear to the American public about what their recommendations would be for mask wearing moving forward.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And can I ask one question about the Ukraine-Bel- &#8212; on Belarus &#8212;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you talk about the Belarus situation and aiding Russia?&nbsp; What &#8212; is there &#8212; are there additional actions that the United States is considering?&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just speaking of SWIFT, there&#8217;s been some reports that Europe is considering or looking at kicking Belarus out of SWIFT.&nbsp; Is that something &#8212; is the United States part of those discussions?&nbsp; Does it support that type of action against Belarus?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have anything to predict on that front at this point in time, but what I will say is we&#8217;ve already taken steps to put in place sanctions on some leaders in Belarus, some of the military components; certainly, we could build on that.&nbsp; But I don&#8217;t have anything to predict at this point in time.&nbsp; But we certainly are a part of those discussions.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; One of the topics &#8212; I know you don&#8217;t want to get into, you know, stuff that might be cut.&nbsp; But you guys have said many times that the Chinese have, at least tacitly, supported Putin’s moves into Ukraine.&nbsp; Is the President going to call out the Chinese for that behavior or President Xi Jinping or what you guys have been trying to get the Chinese to do on helping with Ukraine or helping with Russia on this crisis?&nbsp; Is he going to mention that at all?</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I would say this speech is more about the unity of the vast majority of the global community in standing up against President Putin, it&#8217;s more about American leadership in this moment, and it&#8217;s more about even unity here in standing up against the aggression of President Putin into Ukraine.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would say, on the Chinese, what we&#8217;ve said generally is that it&#8217;s important at this moment for any country to be vocal in speaking out against the actions of President Putin and &#8212; and Russian leaders in this moment.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What we have seen from the Chinese last weekend &#8212; or, I guess, a weekend before that at the Munich Security Conference &#8212; they reiterated their support for the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine.&nbsp; We saw them abstain from the U.N. Security Council vote.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, you know, this is not a moment to be on the sidelines.&nbsp; This is a moment to be vocal, and this is a moment to think about where you are in history.</p>



<p>But I think the speech, for everyone&#8217;s expectation for tomorrow, is more about laying out efforts to the American people that the United States has undertaken to rally the world for democracy and against Russian aggression.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But you are, in general, pushing the Chinese to be less on the sidelines and not trying to have it both ways, basically, by being vocal?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Again, they have implemented the sanctions.&nbsp; If they don&#8217;t do that, then we obviously have steps we can take.&nbsp; We are encouraging every country to continue to be vocal and more vocal as it relates to Russia&#8217;s aggression and invasion of Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead.&nbsp; Oh, go ahead.&nbsp; Go.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One more &#8212; just breaking news.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Prime Minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau, just announced that he &#8212; the Canadians would unilaterally ban Russian crude oil imports.&nbsp; I know you&#8217;ve just talked a lot about how you&#8217;re taking into account how this will impact the Europeans.&nbsp; But is there something you had &#8212; is this something you would just do unilaterally, not as a coordinated effort?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; From the beginning &#8212; again, all options remain on the table &#8212; you have seen us take a number of actions over the last several days that play that out.&nbsp; But I don&#8217;t have anything to predict at this point, other than to reiterate that we have really worked to take steps in lockstep with the Europeans and a number of our NATO partners.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; On Friday, you said this isn&#8217;t &#8212; this is not a “moment where diplomacy feels appropriate.”&nbsp; The French President talked with Putin hours ago.&nbsp; So, have the discussions between the Russian and Ukrainian delegations changed &#8212; or how are they influencing President Biden’s stance on having leader-to-leader discussions.&nbsp; We&#8217;re a few days out from that.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Nothing has changed in terms of the President &#8212; this President&#8217;s assessment of having a conversation or engagement with President Putin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As we said before, we&#8217;re not ruling it out ever; it just is not the appropriate moment or the moment for the United States President to have a conversation with the President of a country invading a sovereign country.&nbsp; That&#8217;s our view; other countries make their own decisions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In terms of the engagements or discussion between the Ukrainians and the Russians, I&#8217;d really point you to the Ukrainians to get more of a readout from that.&nbsp; There have been reports that those will continue.&nbsp; I would point you to them to confirm whether that is the case.&nbsp; And I expect we will be in touch with the Ukrainians, as we are nearly every day.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the beginning, you kind of outlined all of the support being given not just by the United States but other countries who typically have not done so.&nbsp; But I wonder if you &#8212; if the administration has any concerns about how President Putin would use that as an excuse to escalate and possibly attack NATO Allies, considering his warnings about the West getting involved in this crisis?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I think it&#8217;s important to step back and remember who the aggressor is here.&nbsp; The aggressor is President Putin.&nbsp; The aggressor is the Russian military at the direction of President Putin into a sovereign country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The world is standing up against this aggression, and he is feeling the impact already of the financial sanctions and consequences.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you just look purely at the impact on the Russian economy, even today: The ruble fell 20 to 25 percent and is trading at its weakest level ever.&nbsp; The Russian stock market was kept closed today, likely due to a fear of capital flight once it opens.&nbsp; The Russian Central Bank more than doubled their key interest rate to 20 percent, the highest in almost 20 years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is the world saying, “This is not acceptable.”&nbsp; It is now up to President Putin, if he wants those circumstances to change, to change his own behavior.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, last one: The U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released kind of a major, unprecedented report with lots of warnings today and said some places in the world have basically maxed out their capacity to adapt to climate change, while others soon will.&nbsp; I&#8217;m curious &#8212; I mean, Joe Manchin offered kind of a slimmed down BBB version with $555 billion for climate &#8212; will the administration be pressing Democrats to at least move on that portion of climate change in light of the recent developments of this recent report?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would say, first, the President agrees absolutely that we need to do more.&nbsp; That is why they &#8212; that he has been such an advocate for historic levels of investment in addressing our climate crisis.&nbsp; And if we had had 50 votes to move that forward, we would have done that.&nbsp; Right?&nbsp;</p>



<p>So there are ongoing discussions, of course; they are happening a lot on the Hill between members on the Hill.&nbsp; The President remains committed to moving that forward.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I would also note that part of what was in that report was the need to bolster adaptation efforts that increase our resilience to the impacts of climate change.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And one of the &#8212; and a couple of pieces that the President has already done: He launched an Emergency Plan for Adaptation and Resilience, a whole-of-government response, to help more than half a billion people in developing countries adapt to and manage the impacts of climate change.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And he also &#8212; the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, we often forget &#8212; not you, maybe, but some of us &#8212; that it will strengthen our nation’s resilience &#8212; that’s a big part of it &#8212; to extreme weather and climate change while reducing greenhouse gas emissions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, we absolutely need to do more.&nbsp; We want to do more.&nbsp; But we have &#8212; he has already taken some steps to help address because we recognize that resilience is something that there needs to be more work and effort on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.&nbsp; The administration has been studying for months the impact of the sanctions that were rolled out over the weekend and their potential impact on financial markets in the West.&nbsp; You just detailed what happened in the Russian markets, but I&#8217;m wondering if there&#8217;s been any fallout that&#8217;s been seen that would warrant government intervention by central banks in Western countries.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; In Europe or in the United States?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In either.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I can only speak to the United States.&nbsp; I mean, I think that our effort &#8212; and, as you noted, we have been preparing and studying and analyzing for months now.&nbsp; As you know, Russia is, I think, our 26th-largest trading partner; it&#8217;s not an enormous trading partner of ours.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And we&#8217;ve obviously been taking steps to mitigate any impacts on our markets.&nbsp; We&#8217;re not trying to tank our markets, to state, kind of, the obvious here.&nbsp; We&#8217;re trying to maximize the impact on the Russian economy and squeeze around President Putin.</p>



<p>In terms of analysis, otherwise, I would point to the Treasury Department and European officials.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Pentagon has also said that President Putin and Russian forces continue to advance on Kyiv, that that is still the ultimate goal of President Putin.&nbsp; So, I&#8217;m wondering, with all of the sanctions that have already been rolled out, what else can the U.S do besides wait?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, one, we have provided an additional enormous package of security assistance &#8212; the President announced over the weekend.&nbsp; We have provided an enormous package of humanitarian assistance.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re continuing to plus up support for our neighbors in the region.&nbsp; That is &#8212; we continue to be the largest provider of all of those, and we continue to have the backs of the Ukrainian leadership and the Ukrainian people.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; President Zelenskyy says the next 24 hours are critical, though. &nbsp;So is there a risk that all of that equipment ends up in Russian hands?&nbsp; How do you prevent that?</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; There&#8217;s always steps the Department of Defense takes to mitigate that, and we take them in &#8212; in coordination with our partners.&nbsp; I would have you speak with them about more specifics.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; Oh &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; I wanted to ask for more specifics on refugees.&nbsp; I know that you told Kristen just now that the U.S. will accept refugees from Ukraine.&nbsp; Do you have a specific number of refugees?&nbsp; And what &#8212; how would you determine that?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, there&#8217;s &#8212; I would first note that we &#8212; we continue to believe that the vast, vast majority will go to Europe.&nbsp; And so, this is different from other conflicts where that has not been the &#8212; the likely outcome.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We &#8212; in terms of specific numbers, we do not have that.&nbsp; There are refugee programs that they would have to, of course, apply for.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There&#8217;s a question about Temporary Protected Status, whether that applies to refugee &#8212; people who are in &#8212; not refugees, but people who are in the United States right now.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But, again, what our focus is on &#8212; because we think it will impact the vast majority of refugees &#8212; is working in close coordination with our European partners and plussing up our humanitarian assistance and assistance in these countries where they&#8217;re &#8212; where they are receiving refugees.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also wanted to ask about voting.&nbsp; Texas has an election coming up, and they&#8217;re beginning to have people who vote by mail &#8212; their ballots being rejected.&nbsp; I know this administration has been very vocal about new voting laws that it disagrees with.&nbsp; Can you talk about what you, as an administration, are doing to leverage the resources of the White House and of the executive branch to help people get access to voting in the coming weeks, not just in Texas but around the country, as elections get going?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; So, we absolutely can get you a readout of that.&nbsp; I would say, though, that the vast majority of this is going to come from the Democratic National Committee and the political arm.&nbsp; Right?&nbsp; So, I would really point you to them for more specifics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead.&nbsp; Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you so much.&nbsp; I just have two quickies on Ukraine.&nbsp; First of all, with the upcoming ASEAN Summit, does President Biden hope to use this summit to shore up support &#8212; I guess you could say, in opposition to Ukraine &#8212; in opposition to Russia, or however you want to put it?&nbsp;</p>



<p>And how does the administration feel about Myanmar&#8217;s support of Russia?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I think, for any country, what our message is, is that it&#8217;s important to deter- &#8212; to think about what place &#8212; where you want to stand on the side of history, and that is how you will be judged moving forward.&nbsp; And obviously, we are encouraging every country who has &#8212; who has not been condemning the actions of Russia to change course.</p>



<p>As it relates to the ASEAN Summit, which is in a couple of weeks, I don&#8217;t have anything about the agenda at this point in time.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re certainly not waiting to communicate &#8212; the President is not waiting to communicate with &#8212; or our national security team is not waiting to communicate with ASEAN countries about steps they can take to help be a part of the solution here, whether it is providing &#8212; we&#8217;ve seen a lot of progress on this front &#8212; LNG gas access to European countries that they don&#8217;t need, or condemning the actions, or putting in place sanctions and steps themselves.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, quickly, just on sanctions: Every round of sanctions the administration describes is &#8220;the harshest yet,&#8221; &#8220;the strictest yet.&#8221;&nbsp; But President Putin is not responding to these so far.&nbsp; And so, what &#8212; what happens next?&nbsp; Do you have anything else in your tool belt?&nbsp; Because, I mean, these all seem very severe, and it boggles the mind as to what more you can do.&nbsp; So, what else do &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We always have more we can do.&nbsp; But I would say that what we&#8217;re seeing, in terms of the impact on the financial markets in Russia, is significant.&nbsp; And I outlined some of the impacts, of course, on the ruble, on inflation, on central bank lending there in Russia.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All of these steps squeeze not just President Putin, but squeeze the people around him and have a huge, devastating impact on the economy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And they are more significant.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve built them more significant over time.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s what they&#8217;re intended to do &#8212; is to have those consequences that build over the course of time.</p>



<p>Thanks, everyone.</p>



<p>(Cross-talk by reporters.)</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:  I will see you all tomorrow.  Thank you, everyone, very much. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>East Room</em></p>



<p>2:43 P.M. EST</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE PRESIDENT: &nbsp; Well, Cateo, I tell you what, you didn&#8217;t there &#8212; we have a little ongoing thing in &#8212; in the administration.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As you&#8217;ve mentioned, there are a fair number of African Americans in high places in my administration, but &#8212; and I&#8217;m always hearing about Howard &#8212; great school; I&#8217;m hearing about Morgan men; I&#8217;m hearing about &#8212; you know, all these other things.&nbsp; But I keep talking about it: Delaware State.&nbsp; (Laughter.)</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And although I went to the University of Delaware, I tell you &#8212; there&#8217;s an old expression: &#8220;I tell you who brung me to the dance.&#8221;&nbsp; Delaware State University is in the southern &#8212; the middle of my state &#8212; in Dover, Delaware.&nbsp; And the lower &#8212; we have the eighth-largest Black population in America, as a percent of the population.&nbsp; And the lower two counties are fairly conservative compared to the northern county.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I &#8212; I operated out of Delaware State for a significant portion of my career and campaign, as the gentlewoman from the state of Delaware can tell you.&nbsp; (Laughter.)</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And there was a guy named Tony Allen who used to work for me &#8212; worked for me for years.&nbsp; He went out and he got his PhD.&nbsp; Then he left and became a president.&nbsp; You know, he&#8217;s now &#8212; Tony, stand up &#8212; president of Delaware State University.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I learned a long time, from good friends of mine in Delaware in the Civil Rights community, that if you want to know where the real power in America lies, it&#8217;s in the Divine Nine.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; We&#8217;re in the only administration in history that actually has an office.&nbsp; Right, Jim?&nbsp; We have a Divine Nine office.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, I &#8212; I understand &#8212; I understand, as they say, who &#8220;brung me to the dance.&#8221;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And all kidding aside, you&#8217;re going to be incredible, old buddy.&nbsp; You&#8217;re going to do well.&nbsp; You&#8217;re going to do very well.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, you know, there is a &#8212; I don&#8217;t know if they&#8217;ve been introduced, but my Secretary of Defense &#8212; Secretary Austin &#8212; stand up.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My Secretary of Housing, Secretary Fudge.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My Administrator &#8212; the guy who&#8217;s running and taking care of the EPA and all the rest &#8212; from Carolina &#8212; (laughs) &#8212; Administrator Regan.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And Acting Director of OMB &#8212; the woman who has all &#8212; controls all the money &#8212; (laughter) &#8212; Shalanda &#8212; Shalanda Young.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And a woman who &#8212; I really mean it &#8212; has let the whole world know who we are.&nbsp; No, really.&nbsp; A woman who has been so incredibly effective in her job.&nbsp; But it wasn&#8217;t until recently &#8212; until the outrage of Putin and Soviet Union &#8212; and the Soviet Union &#8212; trying to re-establish the Soviet Union, basically, but &#8212; and Russia.&nbsp; To hear her, to listen to her run the debates on &#8212; at the Security Council, as well as the General Assembly at the United Nations &#8212; Linda Greenhouse [sic] &#8212; Thomas-Greenfield.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And a woman who knows a little bit about the economy &#8212; Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, Ceci- &#8212; (laughs) &#8212; I kid her all the time, being from Princeton, but &#8212; (laughter) &#8212; (inaudible).&nbsp; Cecilia, congratulations.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, Mr. Secretary &#8212; I&#8217;m talking about Cateo right now &#8212; (laughter) &#8212; I think they&#8217;re ready to elect you anything you want to be, pal.&nbsp; (Laughter.)</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Look, I want to welcome everyone to the White House.&nbsp; This has been &#8212; it&#8217;s been a long drought, the last year and a half, not being able to have not just Black History Month, we weren&#8217;t &#8212; not able to have any gathering here at the White House of any crowd at all.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s good to have you back.&nbsp; It&#8217;s wonderful to be able to host this event in person.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And it’s great to see so many friends.&nbsp; If I begin calling out &#8212; calling the roll, we&#8217;ll be all night here, and I don&#8217;t want to do that.&nbsp; But so many significant leaders who&#8217;ve changed the face of America sitting in the audience, not on this stage.&nbsp; So, thank you all so very, very, very much.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My name is Joe Biden.&nbsp; I&#8217;m Jill Biden&#8217;s husband.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; As you&#8217;ve already figured out, I can&#8217;t dance.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; I do it, but I ain&#8217;t good at it.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; And &#8212; (laughs) &#8212; oh man, you have great opportunities now, don&#8217;t you, Jilly.&nbsp; (Laughter.)</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tomorrow, I&#8217;m going to be delivering the State of the Union Address.&nbsp; And today, I simply want to thank you for all you’ve done for me, for all of the country.&nbsp;&nbsp; So much has been accomplished in the people in this room.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Black History Month is more than a celebration.&nbsp; It’s a powerful, powerful reminder that Black history is American history.&nbsp; Black culture is American culture.&nbsp; Black stories are essentially an ongoing story of America.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I see it every day with the Vice President and the incredible job she&#8217;s doing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We see it in the Black members of the Cab- &#8212; my Cabinet and the White House staff who are here today, who serve to defend the nation; protect the planet; build the economy; deliver housing, jobs, and justice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And we see it the tireless, heroic efforts of the Congressional Black Caucus.&nbsp; And I want to &#8212; I&#8217;m going to embarrass him, but I want &#8212; the former Chairman of the Black Caucus has come over to help me run things.&nbsp; Cedric, stand up.&nbsp; Let everybody see you.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I used to &#8212; I never played golf until I was 46 years old.&nbsp; I got to be pretty good.&nbsp; Then I &#8212; and I asked Cedric to help me in my campaign.&nbsp; Then I played golf, and he beat the hell out of me.&nbsp; I wish I had never done it.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; I don’t know.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so many state and local leaders and faith leaders here &#8212; lawyers, educators &#8212; that are here today.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, of course, we see another first in the nomination of Ketanji &#8212; well, you saw her.&nbsp; I guess you saw Justice Brown &#8212; Justice Brown Jackson, who is on the &#8212; on the Circuit Court of Appeals right now.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is an incredible woman.&nbsp; This is a woman who graduated magna cum laude from Harvard.&nbsp; She graduated &#8212; she was editor of the Law Review.&nbsp; She has done so many other things.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I want to make it clear: Not only is she is eminently qualified, there were so many others I had to choose from.&nbsp; I can tell you, Jim &#8212; Jim is &#8212; supported all the nominees, but the one he most supported (inaudible) &#8212; I&#8217;ve already nominated her to be on the Circuit Court of Appeals, the second-highest court in the nation.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Judge &#8212; Judge Jackson is going to be an outstanding justice.&nbsp; She&#8217;s part of an incredible group of Black women who I’ve nominated to the federal bench.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve nominated more Black women to the federal bench than any administration in the history of the United States of America.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, I made that commitment when I was running for President, and I&#8217;ve tried to keep that commitment my whole career.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You know, and the first executive order I signed when I came into office &#8212; and it was with Cedric&#8217;s help.&nbsp; I sat down, put pencil to paper &#8212; or pen to paper, and signed a &#8212; I instructed every single element of my administration, every department, from the Defense Department to the &#8212; to the Justice Department and on, that equity should be the center of our &#8212; all of what we do.&nbsp; And we did that in the COVID-19 response.&nbsp; Remember at the beginning, everyone was concerned whether or not, as usual, African Americans would be left behind.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, we helped Black &#8212; they &#8212; we helped raise the vaccination rate among Black Americans and bring it on par with white adults.&nbsp; All &#8212; the same across the board.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I want to thank the members of the Black Coalition Against COVID represented here today as well.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>And I also want to thank Derrick Jones, also as D-Nice &#8212; (laughter) &#8212; for being &#8212; stand up, man.&nbsp; Let them see who you are.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; He provided the soundtrack of hope to keep our spirits up during the worst days of that pandemic.&nbsp; And thank you, thank you, thank you, man.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>You know, when I took office, I said, “the American story depends not on&#8221; how many of us &#8212; &#8220;any one of us, not on some of us, but on all of us.”&nbsp; “On all of us.”&nbsp; So, we’re investing in all of us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So many of you here helped enact the American Rescue Plan to deliver immediate economic relief with Rescue checks, to tax cuts, to eliminate &#8212; and the estimate is that we’ve cut Black poverty by over 30 percent.&nbsp; We’ve reduced child poverty by more than 50 percent in the Black community.</p>



<p>The American Rescue Plan also included historic funding that allowed cities and states to invest in community violence intervention programs and keep neighborhoods safe.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Look, you were critical in getting the Infrastructure Law passed &#8212; a bipartisan bill that’s going to get &#8212; that’s going to do so much.&nbsp; It’s going to replace decades of disinvestment in the United States of America.&nbsp; A commitment to reconnecting communities and people and job opportunities.&nbsp; Lots &#8212; so much of what they &#8212; the early investments in highways and in interstates &#8212; they cut neighborhoods in half.&nbsp; They divided things.&nbsp; We can put it back together again.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Clean water.&nbsp; High-speed Internet.&nbsp; It’s going to &#8212; we’re going to eliminate every lead pipe in America so our children don’t have to worry about whether they&#8217;re drinking poison water, in effect.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And as part of that law, we made Minority Business Development Agency permanent and seeded it with $110 million so Black businesses can get the capital they need to grow.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>And I’m also proud to be joined by Opal Lee, when &#8212; we made the Juneteenth the first federal holiday in the last 40 years.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; It’s good to see Ms. Lee here.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>You know, we’ve made landmark investments of $5.8 billion in Historic Black Colleges and Universities not just because we’ve got some serious advocates for Howard and Morehouse &#8212; (laughter) &#8212; and other HBCUs you’ve heard of, like Delaware and others.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; But all &#8212; but all kidding aside, because they offer so much promise to the nation &#8212; so much promise.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s good to see the many HBCU leaders here tonight, including Dr. Devona Williams of Delaware State; Tony Allen &#8212; I mean, Tony of Delaware State, chair of the Board of Advisors of HBCUs.</p>



<p>And, look &#8212; and I want all of you to know, we’re ready to closely investigate the cowardly, un-American bomb threats against HBCUs.&nbsp; That’s underway.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have so much more to do as a nation on making everyday things more accessible and affordable.&nbsp; As my friend Jim Clyburn says, “That’s the test of whether government delivers.”&nbsp; Are they accessible and affordable?&nbsp; Prescription drugs.&nbsp; Child care.&nbsp; Housing.&nbsp; Make healthcare more affordable and make progress on Black maternal health, something that Kamala has been leading the effort on.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; To end cancer as we know it by putting science and technology to work to address the inequities in testing and diagnosis and access to care.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, you know, we’ve got work to do to deliver police and criminal justice reform as well.&nbsp; Even though Congress isn’t acting, we are making changes in federal law enforcement policies: banning chokeholds, restrictions on no-knock warrants, requirements on federal &#8212; for federal agents to wear and activate their body cameras, ending the Department of Justice’s use of private prisons.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All of this is being &#8212; is happening.&nbsp; And the Justice Department has opened pattern-and-practice investigations for systemic police misconduct in several key police departments in the country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’ve just got to stay on it.&nbsp; With your help, we’re going to keep pushing on this.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And we &#8212; we’re protecting our country’s threshold liberty, the sacred right to vote, which I’ve never seen as under such attack.&nbsp; You know, it’s always made it harder for Blacks to vote, but this is trying to be able to figure out how to keep the Black vote, when it occurs, from even counting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over the past year, we’ve directed federal agencies to promote access to voting.&nbsp; We’ve &#8212; we’ve appointed top civil rights advocates to help the U.S. Department of Justice, which is &#8212; has doubled the number of voting rights enforcement on &#8212; enforcement folks on their staff.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, again, we call on Congress: Pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Pass the Freedom to Vote Act.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; We can do this.&nbsp; The American people agree with us &#8212; Black and white, Hispanic and all.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let me conclude with this.&nbsp; Look &#8212; I don’t want to take much more of your time, but let me conclude with this: I know progress can be slow and frustrating.&nbsp; But I also know it’s possible if we work together, if we keep the faith, if we remember the changes and the charges that have passed down to us from all those who came before us &#8212; many sitting in this room right now.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You’ve heard &#8212; you know, as you‘ve heard, we had a wonderful exhibit downstairs celebrating Black History Month.&nbsp; And I want to thank Lonnie Bunch and the Smithsonian, as well as the Library of Congress for their &#8212; giving us access to their collection.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When I introduced Judge Jackson on Friday out in the hallway here, I thought about the display that holds the signature of the Judicial Oath of Office sworn and signed by Thurgood Marshall himself.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It was Justice Marshall who reminded us, in a speech shortly before he died, and I quote, “America can do better because America has no choice but to do better.”&nbsp; “America has no choice but to do better.”&nbsp; It’s a powerful reminder of the history of the journey of America and the power each of us hold to write a more just and hopeful chapter.&nbsp; And I really mean it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I am more optimistic about our chances to bring equity to this country than we ever have before now.</p>



<p>And if you wonder about it, just take a look &#8212; take a look at the dif- &#8212; the reason I have so much hope is the younger generation.&nbsp; Those folks be &#8212; they learn from grade school through 30 years of age.&nbsp; Look at what&#8217;s going on.&nbsp; Look at how they act with one another.&nbsp; There&#8217;s not this isolation.&nbsp; There is everything you see &#8212; everything you see from television commercials, down to how we act with one another.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have so much going for us.&nbsp; We got to just let them have their shot.</p>



<p>Folks, I want to thank you all for being here.&nbsp; I really mean it.&nbsp; I want to thank you for all you&#8217;ve done, all that we can do, and being committed that we&#8217;re going to do so much more.</p>



<p>So thank you, thank you, thank you.&nbsp; May God bless you all.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>(The President and First Lady move to exit.)</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. President, should Americans be worried about nuclear war?</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; No.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Today, the White House and the Department of Justice announced 99 law schools have responded to the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/ag/page/file/1428626/download">Attorney General’s Call to Action to the Legal Profession</a>, issued on August 30, 2021, to address the housing and eviction crisis. The Attorney General’s Call to Action asked lawyers and law students to take immediate action to help their communities through Emergency Rental Assistance application support, volunteering with legal aid providers, helping courts implement eviction diversion programs, among other initiatives aimed at increasing housing stability and access to justice.</p>



<p><strong>The Response from the Legal Profession to the Attorney General’s Call to Action was Swift and Wide Reaching and Helped to Keep Eviction Filings Below 60% of Historic Averages.</strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>99 law schools in 35 states and Puerto Rico immediately committed their law schools to help prevent evictions</strong>. These law schools worked with faculty and students to take immediate and meaningful action to combat the crisis. (See appendix for list of law schools and activities.)</li><li><strong>Over the past five months, over 2,100 law students dedicated over 81,000 hours to serve over 10,000 households</strong>, based on a survey tracking the effort facilitated by Georgetown University Law Center Dean William Treanor and New York University School of Law Dean Trevor Morrison.</li></ul>



<p><strong>The Biden-Harris Administration Implemented a Whole-of-Government Push to </strong><strong>Encourage Immediate Relief and Lasting Reform on Eviction Policy Nationwide</strong><strong>. </strong>The Call to Action by the Attorney General and the response from 99 law schools is part of a whole-of-government approach to help millions of families keep up on rent and remain in their homes. The effort has led to increased access to counsel and eviction prevention in jurisdictions across the country.</p>

<p><strong>Broad Legal Community Answered the Call of Attorney General</strong><strong>:</strong> Beyond law schools, Presidents of several major legal organizations, including the American Bar Association, National Bar Association, Hispanic National Bar Association, National Conference of Bar Presidents, and Legal Services Corporation, adopted eviction prevention as a priority and encouraged action among members. Within 24 hours of the Attorney General’s Call to Action, the Association for Pro Bono Counsel and Law Firm Antiracism Alliance, which has nearly 300 law firm members, hosted trainings for hundreds of pro bono attorneys on assisting tenants with ERA applications.<br><strong>Historic Progress on Emergency Rental Assistance Program &#8211; Aiding Renters and Preventing Evictions</strong>:<br>The rapidly increasing pace of rental assistance, along with efforts to put into place eviction diversion programs, helped dramatically increase relief for those in need following the end of the national eviction moratorium. Instead of the predicted tsunami of evictions, because of the Administration’s efforts to implement rental assistance programs and provide flexibility to grantees, eviction filings have remained below 60% of historic averages nationally and well below the 3.7 million evictions filed in a typical year. Representing a historic effort to prevent eviction, well over 3 million households received Emergency Rental Assistance under the program, with approximately <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0551">$25-$30 billion in ERA funds either spent or obligated by the end of 2021</a>.<br><br><strong>99 Law Schools Took Meaningful Action to Expand Access to Justice and Increase Housing Stability</strong><strong>:</strong><br>On the same day the Attorney General issued the Call to Action, the Deans of 99 law schools issued a statement of support and committed to take immediate and meaningful action to combat the eviction and housing crisis. The law schools acted with urgency and, over the past five months, have continued to draw on resources—such as pro bono and externship programs, clinical offerings, and the service of the larger law school communities—to respond to the Attorney General’s call. Law schools partnered with ERA programs, community-based organizations, and trusted community leaders to increase access to crucial resources and legal assistance. Law students volunteered to support pro bono and legal services attorneys by identifying families facing eviction, conducting intake and research, and drafting motions. Clinics partnered with courts to create eviction diversion programs, eviction defense walk in clinics, and “lawyer and law student of the day” programs. In communities across the country, law students hosted pop up clinics, help-a-thons, ERA application workshops, and canvassed in high risk communities to ensure tenants had access to justice and increased housing stability.</p>



<p><strong><u>APPENDIX A</u></strong><br><strong><em>Examples of Law School Responses to the Attorney General’s Call to Action to the Legal Profession<br></em></strong><br><strong>Rutgers University Law School: </strong><em>Dedicated $2 Million in State Funding to Establish Cross-Campus and Statewide Anti-Eviction Initiative to Address the Crisis.</em> Across campuses, Rutgers University Law School dedicated $2 million in state funding to increase the school’s ability to ramp up eviction prevention efforts. The Law School hired multiple new housing attorneys to represent clients and supervise students in eviction defense work. Students served over 350 households and dedicated over 3,700 hours to increasing housing stability in the community in the fall 2021 semester alone.</p>



<p>On the Newark campus, students faced the challenge of finding tenants. The courthouse, where tenants typically connect with law students and attorneys, had been closed since March 2020, leaving tenants to navigate online evictions without assistance. Associate Professor of Law Norrinda Brown Hayat established a Housing and Tenant Solidarity Clinic with the goal of making tenants aware of pending cases, ERA, and counsel. Students conducted file review to identify pending evictions and provided legal and ERA application assistance to tenants with upcoming hearings. Students also launched the Stop Evicting Newark: Know Your Rights Campaign, in partnership with Newark Water Coalition. Every week, law students participated in clean water and food distributions to offer on the spot assistance with ERA applications and legal representation. Students engaged with over 200 community members in high risk communities each week. In addition, students created short, multi-lingual informational videos that were amplified by community groups and through social media to maximize visibility of ERA and available legal assistance. The law school’s Camden campus developed a Housing Justice Clinic aimed at increasing eviction defense, as well as a new pro bono project to connect tenants with rental assistance and help them apply for dismissal of their eviction case.</p>



<p><strong>New York University School of Law, in Partnership with Fordham University School of Law: </strong><em><u>Launched the New York City Housing Justice Initiative to Train Over 80 Law Students to Increase Access to Emergency Rental Assistance.</u></em> Within two days of the Attorney General’s Call to Action, Professors Sateesh Nori and Julia McNally of New York University’s (NYU) Housing Law Clinic, gathered nearly 100 clinical and pro bono law school programs to expand law schools’ contributions to eviction prevention in their communities. The NYU Housing Law Clinic partnered with Fordham University School of Law and the New York Legal Aid Society to launch the Housing Justice Initiative and train over 80 law students across the city to assist tenants at risk of eviction in applying for ERA. Students in NYU’s Housing Law Clinic also provided legal assistance to prevent evictions and improve housing conditions. In just the fall semester, students helped nearly 60 families stay housed and are continuing their efforts this spring. For the students the opportunity to help a family stay safely housed is transformational. “Working with tenants and vulnerable populations to provide assistance can really help shape students&#8217; sense of themselves as public interest lawyers and their sense of having a future in public interest law,” McNally <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/law-schools-are-answering-justice-departments-call-eviction-help-2021-09-02/">said</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Wayne State University School of Law: </strong><em><u>Filling the Justice Gap in Detroit in Partnership with Legal Services.</u> </em>When the Attorney General issued the Call to Action, it struck close to home for the Wayne State University School of Law. Located in Detroit, the eviction crisis was dire and the end of the eviction moratorium meant widespread homelessness and displacement. Dean Richard Bierschbach gathered the pro bono, experiential, and clinical faculty to immediately launch the Warrior Eviction Defense Corps, a partnership with the City of Detroit, United Community Housing Coalition, and Lakeshore Legal Aid, with the goal of providing legal representation to the thousands of tenants facing eviction. Under the supervision of experienced attorneys, students in the Corps staff eviction dockets, conduct client intake, draft pleadings and settlement documents, and negotiate conditional dismissals on behalf of tenants. Thanks to a statewide eviction diversion order issued by Michigan Supreme Court Chief Justice Bridget McCormick, students can help tenants pause their eviction proceeding in order to access the ERA program. Students also participate in direct tenant outreach to support the work of Detroit’s Eviction Prevention Team. This spring, the Corps plans to add a court watch project and legal research to support a right to counsel program in Detroit.</p>



<p>Pro bono students participating in University of Michigan School of Law’s COVID-19 Corps team also partnered with Lakeshore Legal Aid to meet the growing demand for legal assistance. As Maiya Moncino, the group’s law student founder <a href="https://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/2020/05/university-of-michigan-law-students-offer-free-legal-help-during-coronavirus-pandemic.html">said</a>, “Medical staff are on the front lines, but lawyers are confronting the pandemic’s shockwaves. COVID-19 has created a whole host of legal problems. We want to show up for our communities.”</p>



<p><strong>University of Nebraska College of Law: </strong><em><u>Students Fueled the Tenant Assistance Project to Increase Access to Counsel and Drastically Reduce Immediate Evictions – 98% of Represented Tenants Avoided Immediate Eviction.</u></em> The students at Nebraska University College of Law are the first to point out the unfairness of the eviction system in the state: less than 2% of tenants have access to legal representation, state law does not require actual notice of a hearing, and—without counsel—over 80% of cases result in eviction, often on the same day as the hearing. When first creating the Tenant Assistance Project, which grew significantly thanks to the Attorney General’s Call to Action, faculty and law students wanted to ensure that every tenant facing eviction had an advocate in their corner. The Tenant Assistance Project, a partnership between the Law School and over 20 organizations, including the Nebraska State Bar Association’s Volunteer Lawyers Project and Legal Aid of Nebraska, expanded from a small group of dedicated volunteers to a community of students engaged with a statewide effort to prevent the eviction crisis, thanks to the Attorney General’s Call. Law students are taking a multi-prong strategy to assist over 400 households over the last five months that includes: conducting file review to identify at risk tenants, making direct contact with every household with a pending eviction hearing to offer them ERA application assistance and legal representation, preparing eviction defense packets for pro bono attorneys in every case, and engaging in courthouse advocacy on the day of hearings. As a result of the program, 98% of represented tenants avoided immediate orders of eviction.</p>



<p><strong>Atlanta Area Law Schools</strong>: <em><u>Over 300 Law Students from Atlanta Area Law Schools Provided Pro Bono Support to Attorneys Statewide.</u></em> Just as the Attorney General issued the Call to Action, legal nonprofits across the state of Georgia were seeing a spike in low-income families facing housing instability. Law schools in the Atlanta region answered the Attorney General’s Call to Action by providing the pro bono support necessary to meet the need. John Marshall School of Law first asked for “pro bono heroes” to answer the call by participating in a help-a-thon with Georgia Free Legal Answers. In addition, Georgia State University and John Marshall law students collaborated with Georgia Legal Services Program, Atlanta Volunteer Lawyers Foundation, and Atlanta Legal Aid Society to staff an emergency situation intake project, provide ERA application support, and support pro bono attorneys with eviction defense cases. Law students were able to inform vulnerable renters of their rights, screen for ERA eligibility, and connect them to pro bono or legal aid attorneys. Pro bono volunteers and law students working with Georgia Legal Services Program assisted over 350 tenants and obtained more than $2.5 million for clients in need across 100 cities in Georgia. With Atlanta Volunteer Lawyers Foundation, they conducted outreach to an additional 1,000 households.</p>



<p><strong>Wake Forest University School of Law: </strong><em><u>64 Students Dedicated over 820 Hours to Partner with Medical Providers and Connect Families in Need with ERA.</u></em> When the Attorney General issued the Call to Action, Dean Jane Aiken quickly mobilized the school’s pro bono program and the medical-legal partnership clinic, a collaboration with Wake Forest School of Medicine, the Downtown Health Plaza, and Legal Aid of North Carolina, to respond to the urgent eviction crisis. To Professor Allyson Gold, the director of the clinic, it was clear that ERA would be the most direct and fastest way to protect tenants from the imminent threat of eviction. The clinic partnered with the county’s ERA program to ramp up the visibility and accessibility of the program in the highest risk communities. Students created dual language flyers and posters, canvassed in the community, and hosted multiple community-based workshops to assist tenants with their applications. Between direct outreach and representation, 64 students dedicated 820 hours to serve 110 households. “This would not have been possible without ERA’s unprecedented funding,” said Katie Merlin, a third-year law student who helped organize the school’s response. “We believe access to the American Rescue Plan’s ERA program is the reason that eviction rates are at historic lows in our community.” Law, medical and undergraduate students also collaborated to train Downtown Health Plaza medical providers who serve low-income patients to screen for eviction risk and to refer them for ERA and legal assistance. Pro bono students collaborated with Legal Aid of North Carolina to develop know your rights flyers and a housing law manual for tenants and pro bono attorneys.</p>



<p><strong>Washington, D.C. Area Schools, Led by Georgetown University Law Center: </strong><em><u>Launched Community-Based Clinics and Partnered with Medical Providers to Reach Those In Need of Assistance</u><strong>. </strong></em>Georgetown University Law Center was among the first to answer the Attorney General’s Call to address the eviction crisis and protect the many Washington, D.C. residents in danger of losing their homes. Students from Georgetown University Law Center, along with students from George Washington University and American University Washington College of Law, assisted tenants with ERA applications at pop-up clinics hosted by the D.C. Office of the Attorney General. The effort prevented over two dozen scheduled evictions immediately following the Attorney General’s Call. In addition, Georgetown’s Health Justice Alliance, a collaboration between Georgetown Law and Georgetown University Medical Center, expanded its work to increase legal representation of tenants and provide medical partners with trainings and materials necessary to help patients understand their rights, access ERA, and avoid eviction. Students also distributed information about ERA and eviction prevention to 500 families in the District’s lowest-income schools and conducted “public benefits” check-ups for all clients to increase financial assistance.</p>



<p><strong>Duke University School of Law: </strong><em><u>50 Student Volunteers Established a Court-Based Eviction Prevention Legal Clinic to Ensure Legal Representation to Over 100 Individuals.</u></em> In Durham, North Carolina, the pandemic exacerbated what Duke Law faculty describe as a longtime eviction crisis. Clinic Director Charles Holton, Professor Jesse Hamilton McCoy II, and student coordinator Amanda Joos recognized the immense and immediate need and launched the Eviction Advice Clinic at the Durham County Courthouse. With over 50 student volunteers, they have been able to staff the clinic every week since the Call to Action and provide on the spot legal advice, representation, and assistance with ERA applications. In five months, the students represented approximately 100 individuals who would have otherwise been unrepresented and left to navigate the eviction system under the looming threat of displacement.</p>



<p><strong>Boston University School of Law: </strong><em><u>Leveraging Technology to Increase Tenant Access to Justice</u></em>.&nbsp; As a leader in social justice and civil rights law, Boston University (BU) Law Dean, Angela Onwauchi-Willig recognizes that “Few things are more disruptive and destructive to a person’s life than eviction. You lose your home, your community, your stability—basically, with an eviction, you lose all that you have known, all at once.” So, she did not hesitate to heed the Attorney General’s Call to Action to close the justice gap through the school’s clinical work. In Boston, throughout the pandemic, traditional methods for accessing legal representation were often unavailable due to court and help desk closures and pandemic mitigation protocols. To ensure tenants had meaningful access to assistance, BU Law leveraged technological platforms and launched a pro bono service project using the <a href="https://www.gbls.org/MADE">MA Defense for Eviction Portal</a>, an online portal created by Quinten Steenhuis and available through Greater Boston Legal Services to help tenants respond to eviction actions. The portal connects trained law students and translators with tenants who need assistance drafting and filing legal pleadings within a short window to avoid immediate evictions. BU Law Clinical Instructor Jade Brown <a href="https://www.bu.edu/law/record/articles/2021/eviction-crisis/">reflected</a>, “I really felt we could reach a large number of people. I know, having worked in legal services, just how overwhelmed the system is and how overwhelmed we were.”<br><strong><u>APPENDIX B</u></strong><br><br><strong><em>Statement of Law School Deans in Support of the Attorney General’s Call to the Legal Community</em></strong><br><strong><em>August 30, 2021</em></strong></p>



<p>We, the deans of law schools across the United States, agree with Attorney General Garland that the legal profession is well positioned to provide support for tenants, landlords, and courts in the looming housing and eviction crisis. As law school deans responsible for training the next generation of lawyers to be stewards of an effective, equitable, and just legal system, we feel obliged to do our part. Therefore, we are working with our faculty and students to take immediate and meaningful action to combat this crisis. Drawing on resources such as our pro bono programs, clinical offerings, and the service of our larger law school communities, we will help ensure that families and individuals facing eviction have the legal representation, counseling, and assistance they need to exercise their rights, that those entitled to the support of the Emergency Rental Assistance Program are able to access it, and that eviction proceedings are conducted in a fair and just manner.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>East Room</em></p>



<p>2:29 P.M. EST&nbsp;THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Thank you, Dr. Biden.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Please have a seat, everybody.</p>



<p>Well, good afternoon, everyone.&nbsp; Good afternoon.&nbsp; It is so good to meet so many folks and to see so many folks.&nbsp; It’s nice to be together, under one roof together, isn’t it?</p>



<p>And, of course, it is an honor to be here with our incredible President, Joe Biden &#8212; (applause); First Lady Dr. Jill Biden &#8212; (applause); and the first Second Gentleman of the United States, my husband, Doug Emhoff.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>It is wonderful to be here this afternoon, joined by the members &#8212; the most esteemed members of the Congressional Black Caucus.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; And as a former member of the CBC, I know firsthand that the members of the CBC are truly the conscience not only of the Congress but of our country.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>Thank you, also, to all the clergy joining us today, who continue to lift the spirits and the condition of so many people in our country.&nbsp; And to the community organizers, who work day in and day out to make a difference in the lives of all people in our nation.&nbsp; We are so grateful for you.</p>



<p>And we are gathered, then, at a critical moment in the history of our nation and our world &#8212; a moment in which our democratic principles have come under threat.<br><br>Today, the eyes of the world are on Ukraine and the brave people who are fighting to protect their country and their democracy.&nbsp; And their bravery is a reminder &#8212; a most recent reminder &#8212; that justice, equality, and freedom must never be taken for granted by any of us.<br><br>So, friends, Black History Month was established to teach the history that too often has not been taught: the history of Black excellence and leadership in America &#8212; (applause) &#8212; and also the history of resistance and resilience in America.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>And we are clear: Black history is American history.&nbsp; It is living, breathing history &#8212; history we create every day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And today, of course, our nation faces many great challenges.&nbsp; Among the greatest is the assault on the freedom to vote &#8212; the freedom from which all others flow.&nbsp;<br><br>It will take an all-hands-on-deck approach to safeguard and strengthen the freedom to vote.&nbsp; And the President and I are committed to securing that freedom, as is everyone here.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>And that is why I felt such pride and such hope &#8212; understanding how votes lead to action through elections, it is why I felt such pride and such hope this past Friday when President Joe Biden nominated Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson &#8212; (applause) &#8212; when he nominated her to sit on the United States Supreme Court.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>Because, as we all know, elections matter.&nbsp; And when folks vote, they order what they want.&nbsp; And in this case, they got what they asked for.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>I went off script a little bit.&nbsp; (Laughter.)</p>



<p>And Judge Jackson, of course, will make a phenomenal Justice.&nbsp; She is brilliant.&nbsp; She has a brilliant mind and a record of excellence &#8212; a record that proves she will administer equal justice.&nbsp; And I don’t have to tell everybody here, she has been confirmed on a bipartisan basis three times and deserves, therefore, a swift confirmation now.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>And Judge Jackson will be the first Black woman to sit on our nation&#8217;s highest court.&nbsp; And as Dr. Jill Biden mentioned, it is with that spirit also that we know she will not be the last.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br><br>So, there is a lot to celebrate.&nbsp; There is a lot to look forward to.&nbsp; There is a lot to work toward.&nbsp; And in remembering our history, we remember those great American heroes who continue to inspire and motivate us, who continue to remind us through our memory of them and their contribution and sacrifice what our role and responsibility is at this moment in history.<br><br>And speaking of that, then, when everyone walked in to the White House today, I&#8217;m sure that you may have seen an exhibit celebrating great Black Americans.<br><br>On display is a campaign poster from Shirley Chisholm &#8212; Barbara Lee, I saw you here today &#8212; books by Toni Morrison, Zora Neale Hurston, and Maya Angelou; and a display honoring Dr. Mae Jemison, who I just talked with last week &#8212; you know I’m the head of the Space Council &#8212; (laughter) &#8212; about her life and her work and her enduring commitment to helping young people find their own path to the stars.<br><br>In the exhibit, there is also an Ella Fitzgerald vinyl &#8212; we used to call it an &#8220;album&#8221;; and a Jacob Lawrence painting, which hangs right here in this White House on a permanent basis; and, especially significant in this moment, a judicial oath signed by Justice Thurgood Marshall, whose life&#8217;s work influenced my own.&nbsp; In fact, his portrait hangs currently in the official office of the Vice President of the United States.&nbsp; And &#8212; (applause) &#8212; and a bust of his figure sits in my ceremonial office as well.<br><br>So, as we gather here today, and as we prepare to confirm<br>another historic first to our nation&#8217;s highest court, let us always remember: We stand on the shoulders of giants &#8212; giants in our history, giants in American history, and giants right here in this room.&nbsp;<br><br>This Black History Month, let us recommit to honoring<br>their legacy with action.&nbsp; Let us continue their fight and our fight for justice and equality and opportunity for all so that generations to come may stand on our shoulders and reach even greater heights.<br><br>And history, as I have said many times before, I do believe it to be a relay race.&nbsp; We have been each passed a baton with which we run our part in our pursuit of progress and we will then pass the baton to the next generation.&nbsp;<br><br>And in that spirit, it is now my pleasure to introduce a young, brilliant leader who is leading our nation forward with bravery, creativity, and grace, and excellence.<br><br>Please welcome Cateo Hilton.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br><br>END&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2:38 P.M. EST</p>

<p>Jill and I were saddened to learn of the passing of Dick Blum, a successful businessman, humanitarian, and proud son of California who dedicated much of his public life to fighting poverty around the globe.</p>



<p>For 16 years, I had the honor of serving on the Senate Judiciary Committee alongside Dick’s wife — and one of America’s true trailblazers — Senator Dianne Feinstein. During that time, Jill and I came to know Dick as a friend. He was first and foremost dedicated to his family. He turned his lifelong fascination with Mt. Everest into the American Himalayan Foundation, which he created to help construct schools and hospitals in the Tibetan community. And here at home, Dick bled Berkeley blue — he was fiercely loyal to his alma mater, the University of California, where he established the Blum Center for Developing Economies to seek innovative solutions to the challenges of global poverty.</p>



<p>Above and beyond his many professional and philanthropic accomplishments, Dick was a man of personal decency and generosity — a champion of human rights, driven by genuine care and compassion to make a difference in the world. From his home state to halfway around the globe, his legacy will live on in the families and communities his goodness touched.</p>



<p>Jill and I will miss our friend. Our prayers are with Senator Feinstein, their family, and all those who knew and loved Dick Blum.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>From the first day in office and every day since, the Biden-Harris Administration has taken an historic approach to advancing racial equity, including directing every agency across the whole of the federal government to address the lasting impacts of systemic racism on Black communities. For generations, entrenched disparities in our society and economy, at times facilitated by the federal government, have made it harder for Black Americans to have a fair shot at the American dream. Centuries of injustice and decades of disinvestment in Black communities not only undermine the American promise of equal opportunity, but also keep our entire nation from reaching its potential.</p>



<p>After just one year in office, the Administration has delivered real and lasting change and continues to work each day to deliver equitable outcomes and opportunity for Black Americans.</p>



<p><strong>Economic Opportunity for Black Families and Communities.</strong> By signing into law the historic American Rescue Plan (ARP) and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and implementing robust regulatory reform, President Biden has helped create new economic opportunities for Black Americans and made long overdue investments in Black communities. These transformative policies and programs include:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Providing Immediate Relief to Black People and Families through the American Rescue Plan.</strong> The <a href="https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&amp;id=5f43ffef0d&amp;e=cf669202c8">ARP</a> provided cash relief directly to low- and middle-income Americans last year, and cut Black child poverty by <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/610831a16c95260dbd68934a/t/61ea09926280d03df62aa31d/1642727841927/Monthly-poverty-December-2021-CPSP.pdf">33.3</a>%, lifting more than 1 million Black children out of poverty in December 2021 alone. The President’s plans call for extending this critical tax cut, which expired in December.  In addition, the ARP increased Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits by 15% through September 2021. Beginning on October 1, 2021, USDA&#8217;s Thrifty Food Plan update increased SNAP benefits by $36.30 per person per month.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Reversing Decades of Disinvestment Through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.</strong> For years, politicians have talked about investing in our national infrastructure, but up until now they have failed to follow through. The lack of investment has fallen most heavily on Black and other communities of color. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will replace lead pipes, increase access to good-paying jobs, expand affordable high-speed internet, reliable public transit, clean drinking water, reconnect Black neighborhoods divided by legacy highway infrastructure and other resources to finally give Black communities a fair shot at the American Dream.</li></ul>



<ul><li>The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law permanently authorizes the Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA) for the first time since its inception and elevates the agency head to the position of Under Secretary, granting the agency expanded power to support Black and other minority-owned businesses. The President’s plans would supercharge MBDA by funding it at $1.6 billion through 2029.<ul><li>EPA announced that it will allocate <a href="https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&amp;id=f840c7c7b9&amp;e=cf669202c8">$2.9 billion</a> in Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding to states, Tribes, and territories for lead service line replacement in 2022. The 2022 allocation is the first of five years of nearly $15 billion in dedicated EPA funding for lead service lines that states will receive through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. EPA will encourage states to use these funds to advance proactive lead line replacement programs with a particular focus on disadvantaged communities. Moving forward, EPA will prioritize communities with the highest lead levels and those with environmental justice concerns.</li></ul><ul><li>The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law delivers the largest investment in tackling legacy pollution in American history by cleaning up Superfund and brownfield sites, reclaiming abandoned mine land, and capping orphaned oil and gas wells. More than one in four Black Americans live within 3 miles of a <a href="https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&amp;id=406ac95a00&amp;e=cf669202c8">Superfund site</a>– a higher percentage than for Americans overall. No community deserves to have contamination near where they live, work, play, pray, and go to school.</li></ul></li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Leveraging Federal Procurement to Narrow the Racial Wealth Gap for Black Entrepreneurs and Families.</strong> Recognizing that the federal government spends more than $650 billion each year on purchasing goods and services, President Biden has directed agencies to use federal purchasing power to grow federal contracting with underserved small businesses. He has set a goal of increasing the share of federal contracting dollars to small disadvantaged businesses by 50% by 2025— projected to translate to an additional $100 billion to minority-owned businesses, and helping more Americans realize their entrepreneurial dreams. In December 2021, The Administration further <a href="https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&amp;id=3914654cd1&amp;e=cf669202c8">announced</a> reforms to the federal procurement process to help meet the President’s ambitious target and deliver new opportunities for Black owned and other small disadvantaged businesses.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Extending a Lifeline to Struggling Small Businesses.</strong> The American Rescue Plan provided emergency grants, lending, and investment to hard-hit small businesses – including Black businesses – so they can rehire and retain workers and purchase the health and sanitation equipment they need to keep workers safe. This includes the new $10 billion State Small Business Credit Initiative, which will provide growth capital to early stage companies and main street small businesses in economically disadvantaged areas, including minority-owned businesses.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Ensuring Black Homeowners Get Full Value for their Homes.</strong> In June 2021, President Biden directed the launch of a first-of-its-kind interagency effort to address inequity in home appraisals and conduct rulemaking to aggressively combat housing discrimination. The effort, led by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Marcia Fudge and Domestic Policy Advisor Susan Rice, is developing a set of policy actions and recommendations for President Biden to redress racial bias in home appraisals that will soon be released.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Protecting Black Americans’ Access to Housing by Combating Housing Discrimination.</strong> Following President Biden’s Presidential Memorandum directing his Administration to address racial discrimination in the housing market, HUD published an interim final rule in the Federal Register entitled “Restoring Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing Definitions and Certifications” that requires HUD funding recipients to complete an assessment of fair housing issues, identify fair housing priorities and goals, and then commit to meaningful actions to meet those goals and remedy identified issues.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Helping Black Americans Stay in their Homes.</strong> President Biden’s American Rescue Plan has helped millions of Americans, including Black Americans, stay in their homes by providing emergency rental assistance. Of the $25 billion in rental assistance that was spent in 2021, Black Americans represented more than 40% of aid recipients. In addition, the ARP is helping struggling homeowners catch up with their mortgage payments and utility costs through the Homeowner Assistance Fund. And, it provided additional funding for families and individuals who are recovering from or at risk of homelessness.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Assisting Black Land Owners in Resolving Title Issues. </strong>An estimated 60% of Black-owned land in the South is heirs’ property—property that passes through inheritance without a will and that, as a result, has historically rendered owners ineligible for U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) programs, including lending. In July 2021, the USDA rolled out the Heirs’ Property Relending Program, which primarily aids underserved communities, including Black Americans. The new program provides funds to assist heirs in resolving ownership and succession issues on farmland with multiple owners.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Dismantling Barriers to Accessing USDA Programs and Services.</strong> The ARP provides funding for USDA to establish one or more equity commissions to address historical discrimination and disparities in the agricultural sector. In February 2022, USDA announced the membership of its 15-member Equity Commission Advisory Committee and Equity Commission Subcommittee on Agriculture. The Equity Commission Advisory Committee will advise the Secretary of Agriculture by identifying USDA programs, policies, systems, structures, and practices that contribute to barriers to inclusion or access, systemic discrimination, or exacerbate or perpetuate racial, economic, health and social disparities.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Reducing Barriers for Black Communities Facing Natural Disasters. </strong>In <a href="https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&amp;id=acd8fa07ee&amp;e=cf669202c8">September</a> 2021, FEMA implemented policy changes to reduce barriers that contributed to disparities experienced by Black Americans through programs that provide individual assistance to disaster survivors. These included changes to FEMA policies to make it easier for people living on heirs’ property – which is estimated to be the majority of Black-owned land in the South – to apply for disaster aid.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Ensuring that Federal Grants Don’t Support Discriminatory Activities.</strong> In June 2021, the Department of Transportation (DOT) <a href="https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&amp;id=b916425fbf&amp;e=cf669202c8">issued an Order</a> requiring its offices to review the potential discriminatory impact of grantees’ proposed activities before awarding federal funds. Under the Order, the agency won’t award federal financial assistance unless and until the agency determines that the activities will not be discriminatory in intent or effect. Similarly, in September 2021, the Department of Justice (DOJ) began a review of its grantmaking programs, to ensure that federal funds are not distributed to agencies that engage in racial discrimination in violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Improving the Customer Experience and Service Delivery. </strong>In December, President Biden signed the Transforming Federal Customer Experience and Service Delivery to Rebuild Trust in Government <a href="https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&amp;id=6c2917d192&amp;e=cf669202c8">Executive Order</a> – a commitment from federal agencies to remove red tape on critical government services like claiming retirement benefits or filing taxes and streamline and increase access to these services for all Americans.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Reducing Child Care Cost for Black Families. </strong>The American Rescue Plan secured a $39 billion lifeline to help child care providers stay open and compensate early childhood educators, disproportionately Black Americans, as they provide safe and healthy environments for children and help parents work. Black families are nearly two times more likely than white parents to have to quit, turn down, or make a major change in their job due to child care disruptions. The pandemic exacerbated child care disruptions, and by March 2021, had already led to 9% of child care providers closing. The ARP also included an expansion of the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit; a median income family with two kids under age 13 will receive up to $8,000 towards their child care expenses when they file taxes for 2021, compared with a maximum of $1,200 previously.</li><li><strong>Advancing Equitable Employment Outcomes and Boosting Wages for Black Federal Workers. </strong>In June, President Biden signed an Executive Order on Advancing Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (DEIA) in the Federal Workforce. This Executive Order launched a whole-of-government initiative to cultivate a federal workforce that draws from the full diversity of the Nation and that advances equitable employment opportunities for workers from underserved communities. Further, in 2021 the President signed a series of executive actions leading to a $15 minimum wage for employees of federal contractors and federal employees. These actions will ensure that all federal workers, including Black federal workers, have fair access to federal employment opportunities, and will also represent a step towards addressing longstanding wage disparities.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Ensuring Equitable Educational Opportunity in K-12 Schools and an Education Beyond High School. </strong>As we continue to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, President Biden has delivered the support necessary to enable every school to <a href="https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&amp;id=85fcff5ad8&amp;e=cf669202c8">safely reopen</a> for full-time, in-person instruction; accelerate academic achievement; address the mental health needs of students; and build school communities where all students feel they belong. At the same time, President Biden has worked to ensure equitable access to high-quality education for Black students. These policies and programs include:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Historic Investments to Safely Reopen Schools and Address the Needs of Students. </strong>The ARP provided $130 billion to help elementary and secondary schools safely reopen and address the academic, social and emotional and mental health needs of all students, with funding set-aside to address the needs of students disproportionately impacted by the pandemic, including Black students. The Administration’s efforts to encourage all schools to adopt the CDC&#8217;s recommendations on masking, vaccinations, and other COVID-19 protocols, have been particularly critical to the safe reopening of schools in Black communities hit hard by COVID-19. In addition to funding the implementation of COVID-19 protocols, these funds are being used to hire counselors and social workers, provide tutors, establish and expand summer and after-school programming, and provide a wide range of supports that address the needs of Black students. It also provided funds to every Head Start grantee, which disproportionately serve Black children and families, so that grantees could safely open safely for in-person services and support children and families through the pandemic.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Protecting Students from Funding Cuts.</strong> The ARP’s Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief program includes a first of its kind maintenance of equity requirement to ensure that high-poverty school districts and schools are protected in the event of future funding cuts. The Department of Education has provided resources and technical assistance to states and school districts as they implement this new requirement, which will ensure that school districts and schools serving a large share of students from low-income backgrounds will not experience disproportionate cuts, and that school districts with the highest poverty levels do not experience any decrease in state per-pupil funding below their pre-pandemic level.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Historic Support for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs).</strong> The Biden-Harris Administration has delivered an historic $5.8 billion cumulative investment in and support for HBCUs, including:</li></ul>



<ul><li>The ARP and other pandemic relief programs have provided approximately $3.7 billion to HBCUs since President Biden took office.<ul><li>Additionally, in April, the Department of Education provided approximately $1.6 billion in debt relief to 45 HBCUs, including 13 public institutions and 32 private institutions.</li></ul><ul><li>In July and August, the Department of Education awarded more than $500 million in grant funding to HBCUs for academic capacity-building and fiscal stability.</li></ul><ul><li>President Biden signed an <a href="https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&amp;id=9bb56d7abd&amp;e=cf669202c8">Executive Order</a> establishing the White House Initiative on Advancing Educational Equity, Opportunity, and Excellence through HBCUs, which will create a government-wide approach to support the needs of HBCUs and the communities they serve and eliminate systemic barriers impeding HBCU participation in Federal programs, and in February 2022, appointed Dietra Trent, former Virginia Deputy Secretary of Education, as the Initiative’s Executive Director.</li></ul><ul><li>During HBCU week, President Biden named Tony Allen, President of Delaware State University, as Chair of the President’s Board of Advisors on HBCUs. The President has also named Glenda Glover, President of Tennessee State University as Vice Chair of the Board. The Board, established by the Carter Administration, is meant to advance the goals of the HBCU Initiative.</li></ul></li></ul>



<p><strong>Improving Health Outcomes for Black Communities.</strong> Facing a once-in a century pandemic that highlighted and exacerbated pre-existing racial disparities in our health care system, President Biden took swift action to promote better health access and outcomes for Black families. The ARP lowered health care costs for millions of lower- and middle-income Black families and invested billions to promote equitable vaccine distribution and provide critical supplies to stop the spread of COVID-19. These policies and programs include:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Lowering Health Care Costs.</strong> Millions of lower- and middle-income Black families enrolled in health insurance marketplaces saw their premiums lowered or eliminated as a result of the ARP and will continue to benefit through the end of 2022. <a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/documents/08307d793263d5069fdd6504385e22f8/black-americans-coverages-access-ib.pdf">Thanks to the ARP</a>, 76% of uninsured Black Americans could find a plan for less than $50 a month, and 66% could find a plan for free a month in 2021 with those subsidies. In addition, millions of uninsured Americans gained coverage during the Administration’s 2021 Special Enrollment Period (SEP). Of those newly signing up for HealthCare.gov coverage who attested to race or ethnicity, <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/2021-sep-final-enrollment-report.pdf">15%</a> were Black Americans, up over 60% from 2019.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Improving Black Maternal Health.</strong> The Administration is also committed to improving maternal health outcomes, including addressing the unacceptably high rates of maternal mortality and morbidity that disproportionately impact Black mothers and families. The President’s FY 22 budget request includes more than $200 million to bolster Maternal Mortality Review Committees, implement implicit bias training for health care providers, and create State pregnancy medical home programs, among other actions. It also includes $6 billion for the critical Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program to help vulnerable families put healthy food on the table and address racial disparities in maternal and child health outcomes.<ul><li>The President’s plans includes a historic $3 billion investment in maternal health focused on growing and diversifying the perinatal workforce, improving data collection and maternal health risk monitoring, addressing the social factors that contribute to poor maternal health outcomes, addressing substance use disorders that impact maternal health, promoting increased maternal health research, improving postpartum coverage, and better coordinating care. This includes sparking innovation by allowing states to establish maternal health homes to better coordinate health care for individuals before, during, and following birth.</li></ul><ul><li>It would also require all states to provide continuous Medicaid coverage for 12 months postpartum, eliminating potentially deadly gaps in health insurance at a critical time for individuals. Currently, states are only required to provide coverage for 60 days postpartum, despite research showing that many deaths and complications occur more than 60 days following delivery.</li></ul><ul><li>The Administration has already approved a number of Medicaid demonstrations to expand postpartum coverage, including in Illinois, Virginia, and New Jersey; these states will provide full Medicaid benefits for 12 months postpartum (other states have expanded to six months postpartum coverage or expanded coverage to 10 months for those with substance use disorders). The ARP gives states an easier pathway to extend coverage for pregnant women from 60 days to 12 months postpartum; the Administration is working to encourage all states to take up this option so women can get the care they need to stay healthy.</li></ul><ul><li>In April 2021, President Biden issued the first ever <a href="https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&amp;id=3c9546a4cd&amp;e=cf669202c8">Presidential Proclamation on Black Maternal Health Week</a>, calling on all Americans to recognize the importance of addressing the crisis of Black maternal mortality and morbidity.</li></ul><ul><li>Further, in December 2021, Vice President Harris <a href="https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&amp;id=42a57fd1ee&amp;e=cf669202c8">issued</a> a nationwide call to action to both public and private sectors to improve health outcomes for Black mothers and their children. As part of this call to action, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services issued new guidance to help states provide 12 months (up from 60 days currently) of continuous postpartum coverage through their Medicaid programs. If every state adopted an extension — as required in the President’s plans —then the number of Americans getting coverage for a full year postpartum would roughly double, extending coverage for an estimated 720,000 people in a given year. HHS also announced plans to create a new “Birthing Friendly” hospital designation, which would be the first-ever hospital quality designation by HHS specifically focused on maternity care.</li></ul></li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Building the Pipeline of Black Health Care Providers.</strong> The Administration has made a historic $1.5 billion investment to help grow and diversify the nation’s health care workforce, and bolster equitable health care in the communities that need it most during the COVID-19 pandemic and in the years to come. This funding is supporting the National Health Service Corps, Nurse Corps, and Substance Use Disorder Treatment and Recovery programs. These programs address workforce shortages and health disparities by providing scholarship and loan repayment funding for health care students and professionals, in exchange for a service commitment in hard-hit and high-risk communities.&nbsp; With funding from the American Rescue Plan, the investment supports over 22,700 providers—the largest field strength in history for these programs and a record number of skilled doctors, dentists, nurses, and behavioral health providers committed to working in underserved communities during a moment when we need them the most. Only about 5 percent of physicians in the United States identify as Black despite the fact that Black Americans account for 12 percent of the nation’s total population; over 13 percent of physicians serving through the National Health Service Corps identify as Black.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Ensuring an Equitable Pandemic Response.</strong> Nationwide, Black people have died from COVID-19 at 1.4 times the rate of White people. The ARP provided $160 billion for the vaccines, tests, personal protective equipment, and public health workforce needed to address the spread of COVID-19, an investment that is helping to drive down racial disparities in prevention and care. Due to the ARP and the President’s other investments in equitable access to the COVID-19 vaccine, multiple studies show that the gap in COVID vaccination rates in Black Americans compared to Whites and Latinos has closed. Data as of February 2022 show that 84% of Black adults, 87% of Latinos and 85% of White adults have received at least one shot, compared to 56%, 57%, and 65%, respectively, in May 2021. Additionally:<ul><li>FEMA surged resources to vaccinate all eligible Americans, including by standing up 500 vaccine sites in underserved communities. These emergency measures have helped deliver community-based and culturally competent care. In fact, over 50% of vaccines administered at the federally-run community vaccination centers went to Black Americans and other people of color, and more than 75% of people vaccinated at Community Health Centers are people of color.</li></ul><ul><li>In January 2021, President Biden signed an <a href="https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&amp;id=03fb5b89f7&amp;e=cf669202c8">Executive Order</a> on Ensuring an Equitable Pandemic Response and Recovery, creating a COVID-19 Health Equity Task Force to provide specific recommendations to the President for mitigating the health inequities caused or exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and for preventing such inequities in the future. The Task force transmitted its final report to the White House Office of the COVID-19 Response in November 2021, including recommendations related to interpersonal stress linked to racism, addressing the behavioral health consequences of the pandemic in communities of color, and vaccine, testing, and therapeutics access and confidence. By the end of 2021, the Administration had begun action on over 80 percent of the Task Force recommendations, and remains committed to engaging these recommendations within the historic initiatives and programs built to promote and sustain equity across the federal government. Federal agencies are now developing implementation proposals related to the policies and priorities recommended by the Task Force, which will be submitted no later than March 10.</li></ul></li></ul>



<p><strong>Taking Strong Action to Reform Our Criminal Justice System.</strong> From investing in community violence interventions, to reforming law enforcement, to reducing mass incarceration practices, to supporting reentry, the Biden-Harris Administration has taken concrete actions to reform the criminal justice system and address racial disparities. These policies and programs include:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Reforming Law Enforcement Practices.</strong> In September 2021, the Department of Justice (DOJ) announced a ban on use of chokeholds and carotid restraints except where deadly force is necessary, and new restrictions on no-knock warrants—implementing reforms for federal law enforcement administratively that the President had called on Congress to enact nationwide through the George Floyd Justice in Police Act. The Department also implemented a new policy requiring federal agents to wear body cameras when executing search warrants and pre-planned arrests. These changes make real the policy reform the country must undertake to prevent tragic killings like those of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor in the future. The directives apply to all agencies overseen by the Department including the FBI, Drug Enforcement Agency, and U.S. Marshal’s Service. In September, the Department of Homeland Security announced the formation of the Law Enforcement Coordination Council (LECC)—the Department’s first unified law enforcement coordination body, chaired by the Secretary—to comprehensively review and revise its policies and training on use of force, compliance with civil rights and privacy interests, and other matters. In July 2021, the Department of the Interior created a task force to study and recommend reforms for its law enforcement agencies, including the U.S. Park Police.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Ensuring Constitutional Policing.</strong> The Department of Justice (DOJ) rescinded guidance issued in the previous Administration that curtailed the use of consent decrees, including within investigations into patterns or practices of discrimination and misconduct by police departments. Pattern and practice investigations and consent decrees are critical tools to promote constitutional policing in jurisdictions where reform is warranted. DOJ has opened four such investigations in Minneapolis, Louisville, Phoenix, and Mount Vernon, New York.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Improving Prosecutorial Guidance to Prevent Unduly Harsh Sentencing.</strong> The DOJ withdrew guidance issued in the previous Administration that required prosecutors to always charge the harshest sentences, replacing it with guidance that restored discretion to make decisions about charging, plea agreements, and advocacy at sentencing based on an individualized assessment of relevant facts.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Supporting Legislation to End Racial Disparities in Cocaine Sentencing.</strong> The President endorsed the EQUAL Act, which would eliminate the racially discriminatory crack-powder cocaine sentencing disparity and make the change fully retroactive.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Support for Community Violence Intervention (CVI) Programs.</strong> The President ordered DOJ not to renew contracts for privately-operated criminal detention facilities, covering the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) and U.S. Marshals Service (USMS). When completed, this will result in up to 14,000 people in BOP custody and 10,000 people in USMS custody being moved out of private prisons. To date, the administration has closed a total of 7 contracts, resulting in more than 4,000 people moved out of private prisons.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Support for Community Violence Intervention (CVI) Programs.</strong> Black boys and young men ages 15-34 make up 2% of the population but are 37% of homicide victims, and homicide is the leading cause of death for Black men under the age of 45. Until this Administration, however, CVI programs like violence interrupters and hospital-based programs, which are demonstrated to reduce violence by up to 60%, have been badly underfunded. Under President Biden, the Treasury Department and Education Department issued guidance stating that CVI programs are eligible uses of American Rescue Plan funds—both the $350 billion in aid to state, Tribal, and local governments and the $122 billion to school districts. The Administration pivoted 26 existing grant programs across five agencies to support CVI. And President Biden continues to seek $5 billion in dedicated funding for CVI programs. These historic funds would help curtail the epidemic of gun violence that hits Black communities hardest.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Support for Reentry of Returning Citizens.</strong> In February 2021, President Biden expanded access to Paycheck Protection Program loans by removing restrictions for entrepreneurs with certain past criminal records, bringing long overdue help to small businesses previously unable to access these funds. In June 2021, the Department of Labor awarded $85.5 million to help formerly incarcerated adults and young people in 28 communities transition out of the criminal justice system and connect with quality jobs. The President issued an Executive Order directing the Office of Personnel Management to evaluate the existence of any barriers that formerly incarcerated individuals face in accessing federal employment, and to evaluate how to expand federal employment opportunities for formerly incarcerated individuals. OPM provided its findings and a summary of actions to expand employment for this population to the President in October. Further, in September 2021 the Labor and Treasury Departments released new resources to help employers leverage tax credits and other federal programs to incentivize the hiring of formerly incarcerated persons. HUD clarified that returning citizens are eligible for the 70,000 emergency housing vouchers created by the ARP. Further, President Biden’s plans include an additional $1.6 billion of workforce development and job training funding to invest in re-entry employment efforts.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Addressing Domestic Violent Extremism.</strong> President Biden directed the U.S. government to assess the threat of domestic violent extremism in the United States. In January, Secretary of the Department of Defense (DOD) Lloyd J. Austin III ordered a DOD-wide stand down to discuss the problem of extremism in the ranks, and in April he established a countering extremism working group, directing DOD officials to review and update the definition of extremism contained in <a href="https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&amp;id=ed5a029c91&amp;e=cf669202c8">DOD Instruction 1325.06</a>, and calling on the services to update transition instructions to prevent those leaving the military from being recruited by extremist groups. In March 2021, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence released the unclassified executive summary of the comprehensive assessment acknowledging that enduring domestic violent extremism motivations stem from biases against minority populations. In April 2021, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas ordered an internal review to root out white supremacy and extremism within DHS.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Using Executive Authority to Protect Voting Rights, Democracy, and Access to Justice. </strong>These policies and programs include:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Signing Executive Order Promoting Access to Voter Registration and Voting.</strong> On the 2021 anniversary of Bloody Sunday, President Biden signed an <a href="https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&amp;id=1d4d1ebc06&amp;e=cf669202c8">Executive Order</a> to leverage the resources of the federal government to provide information about the election process and increased access to voter registration opportunities. Agencies across the federal government have <a href="https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&amp;id=87561df6a0&amp;e=cf669202c8">announced steps</a> they are taking to respond to the President’s call for an all-of-government action to enhance the ability of all eligible Americans to participate in our democracy, including the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services’ <a href="https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&amp;id=280f4a922c&amp;e=cf669202c8">recent commitment</a> to make it easier for consumers using HealthCare.gov to connect to voter registration services.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Ensuring Compliance with Voting Rights Laws.</strong> The Department of Justice has taken a variety of steps to help protect the right to vote, including doubling the number of voting rights attorneys, taking steps to ensure compliance with voting rights statutes, launching a task force to combat the increase of threats against election officials and election workers, and issuing guidance on (1) the civil and criminal statutes that apply to post-election audits, (2) methods of voting, including early voting and voting by mail, and (3) the vote-dilution protections that apply to all jurisdictions under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act as they engage in redistricting.</li></ul>



<ul><li>To expand the promise of equal justice under law, the President issued a Presidential Memorandum in May 2021 that <a href="https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&amp;id=32f2f54d32&amp;e=cf669202c8">asked</a> the Attorney General to consider expanding the Department of Justice’s access to justice work. In October 2021, the Attorney General announced the reestablishment of the Office for Access to Justice as a standalone component within the Justice Department dedicated to improving the federal government’s understanding of and capacity to address the most urgent legal needs of communities across America. The President’s May 2021 Memorandum also reinvigorated the White House Legal Aid Interagency Roundtable to prioritize and expand access to legal services and federal programs, including in the areas of criminal indigent defense, civil legal aid, and pro bono services. In September 2021, the Roundtable released its Access to Justice in the Age of COVID-19 report highlighting the urgent need to prioritize and expand access to legal services and federal programs as a result of the Covid-19 crisis.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Appointing and Confirming Black Judges.</strong> President Biden is committed to ensuring that the judiciary is filled with highly qualified individuals who bring both personal and professional diversity to the bench. Since January 2021, President Biden has nominated a total of 84 individuals for federal judgeships, 25 of whom are African American, and 13 individuals for local judgeships in Washington, D.C., 5 of whom are African American. In February, he announced his intention to nominate Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to serve as Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. Of the 48 individuals who have been confirmed to positions on federal courts, 14 are African American.</p>



<p><strong>Restoring Fairness and Humanity to Our Immigration System.</strong>&nbsp; President Biden is committed to reforming our immigration system, promoting racial equity in our immigration policies, and providing legal protections for noncitizens, including Black noncitizens who call this country home.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Extending and Redesignating Haiti and Somalia for Temporary Protected Status (TPS).</strong>&nbsp; The Administration extended legal protections to Haitian and Somalian nationals who have lived in our country for years.&nbsp; TPS is a form of immigration relief available to noncitizens in the United States who cannot return home due to dangerous conditions in their home countries; it enables those individuals to live with their families and work in our communities without fear of removal.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Restarting the Haitian Family Reunification Parole Program (HFRP).</strong> The Obama-Biden Administration created the HRFP in 2014, allowing U.S. citizens and green card holders to apply for parole on behalf of family members in Haiti who have approved immigrant visa petitions.&nbsp; The prior Administration announced the termination of this program in 2019.&nbsp; The Biden-Harris Administration restored HFRP and remains committed to helping Haitian-American families reunify in our country.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Supporting Immigration Reform Legislation.</strong>&nbsp; President Biden remains committed to passing legislation to finally reform our broken immigration system.&nbsp; These reforms would promote racial equity by providing a pathway to citizenship to millions of undocumented individuals, including Black noncitizens.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>&nbsp;The President is not done. The Biden-Harris Administration continues to advance equity and racial justice, including for Black Americans, as we build back better. These policies and programs include:</p>



<ul><li><strong>President Biden’s Proposed Plan Will Promote Investment and Economic Opportunity in Black Communities</strong>. President Biden’s plans will reverse decades of disinvestment and wealth extraction in Black communities, other communities of color and rural communities, and drive good jobs and opportunity to every corner of the country, making long needed, once-in-a-generation investments in underserved communities: The President intends to make universal preschool a reality, cut child care costs and increase access to high-quality child care, reduce housing costs and increase the supply of affordable housing, lower health care costs, improve maternal health, expand coverage to millions of low-income Americans by closing the Medicaid coverage gap, and extend the ARP’s historic child tax credit expansion. The Presidents’ plans also include a $3 billion investment focused on improving maternal health in this country.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Sustained Investment in HBCUs.</strong> President Biden’s plans seek sustained investments in HBCUs and their students. These include $10 billion to HBCUs, Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs), and minority-serving institutions (MSIs). Of that total, $2 billion is dedicated specifically for HBCUs—a five-fold increase from the amounts HBCUs typically receive annually through existing funding streams to address a wide range of needs, including student financial aid, infrastructure upgrades, and campus services. HBCUs can compete for another $4 billion of these funds to support research and development programs.<ul><li>Additionally, President Biden’s FY22 budget request for the Department of Education includes a total of $807 million in discretionary funding to HBCUs, an increase of $72 million over last year’s funding level, which will substantially increase key HBCU funding streams to support research, infrastructure, and student support services, amongst other programming.</li></ul></li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Unwavering Support for the Fundamental and Sacred Right to Vote.</strong> President Biden has firmly and repeatedly called for Congress to enact the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and the Freedom to Vote Act, which would together set national standards that make it easier to vote, and deliver new tools to prevent voting discrimination. The President urged the Senate to change the rules, including getting rid of the filibuster, to pass these critical pieces of legislation. And the President will continue to use every tool at his disposal to protect the right to vote in free, fair, and secure elections.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Transforming Public Education with Historic Funding Increases.</strong> Black students are less likely to have access to high-quality preschool, resulting in disparate outcomes before students even enter kindergarten. They are more likely to attend rundown and unsafe schools. They are taught by less experienced teachers. And they have lower college completion rates and higher student loan debt burdens than their white peers. The President has outlined a <a href="https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&amp;id=a758d3c8cb&amp;e=cf669202c8">far-reaching agenda</a> that will transform public education, advancing equity for Black students and prepare all students to succeed.</p>



<ul><li>The President’s plans would provide universal, high-quality preschool for all three- and four-year-olds; invest in school infrastructure so all students learn in safe and healthy school buildings with the technology and labs they need to prepare for the jobs of the future; and strengthen and diversity the teacher pipeline.</li></ul>



<ul><li>The President’s FY22 budget proposal includes a $20 billion increase in Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) Title I funding, which would more than double funds available under the flagship program for students in high-poverty schools, while providing meaningful incentives for states to address inequitable school funding systems and close gaps in access to rigorous coursework, like advanced math and science courses. Over 80% of Black students attend a Title I-eligible school, and there is a $23 billion annual funding gap between majority white and majority non-white school districts.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Through the President’s plans and his FY22 budget, the President has requested a $950 increase to the maximum Pell Grant for students enrolled in public and private non-profit colleges, benefitting <a href="https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&amp;id=248e202884&amp;e=cf669202c8">75% of HBCU students</a> who receive them.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Addressing Police Misconduct.</strong> The President strongly supported the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. He is disappointed that legislation has not yet reached his desk, and continues to urge Congress to act, while also examining ways to advance meaningful police reform through executive action.</p>

<p>President Biden campaigned on a bold vision of tackling the climate crisis with the urgency that science demands by seizing the opportunity to build a strong domestic energy sector that can manufacture and deploy clean energy for the benefit of all Americans—with lower costs for families, good-paying jobs for workers, and healthier air and cleaner water for communities.</p>



<p>Since Day One, he has delivered. After rejoining the Paris Agreement, restoring scientific integrity, and reinvigorating U.S. leadership on the world stage, President Biden <strong>mobilized every federal agency to achieve groundbreaking goals:</strong> reducing greenhouse gas emissions 50-52% below 2005 levels in 2030, reaching 100% carbon pollution-free electricity by 2035, and delivering 40% of the benefits from federal investments in climate and clean energy to disadvantaged communities. The President formed the first-ever National Climate Task Force, bringing together Cabinet leaders to drive decisive action toward those goals.</p>



<p>Alongside historic executive actions, President Biden also <strong>made climate action and environmental justice a centerpiece of his Bipartisan Infrastructure Law</strong>—which includes the largest federal investments ever in upgrading the power grid, improving public transit and investing in zero-emission transit and school buses, installing a nationwide EV charging network, cleaning up legacy pollution, delivering clean water and replacing lead pipes, demonstrating innovative climate technologies, and increasing climate resilience to safeguard against extreme weather, which last year caused more than $145 billion in damages from the biggest 20 disasters alone.</p>



<p><strong><u>CALLING ON CONGRESS TO DELIVER</u></strong></p>



<p>President Biden knows that we need to move even faster to combat climate change—and that to meet the moment and fully seize the economic opportunity in front of us, Congress must act. <strong>In his first State of the Union address, the President will call on Congress to deliver on a legislative&nbsp;agenda for clean energy and climate action </strong>that has overwhelming support from the American people—Republicans, Democrats, and Independents.</p>



<p>Specifically, the President will lift up the benefits we can secure for American consumers, companies, and communities by enacting critical investments and tax credits for domestic clean energy manufacturing and deployment. He will also highlight how the investments and tax credits would cut energy costs for American families an average of $500 per year.</p>



<p>As part of the President’s unwavering support for climate solutions, these investments will reduce emissions, lower costs for families, create good-paying jobs for workers, and advance environmental justice.</p>



<p><strong><u>BOLD ACTIONS TWO MONTHS INTO 2022</u></strong></p>



<p>As the President works with Congress to deliver on this legislative agenda, he will continue taking decisive and bold action—building on the surge of momentum he has spearheaded to tackle the climate crisis. <strong>During just the first two months of 2022</strong>, the Biden-Harris Administration:</p>
