										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>The President is committed to doing everything he can to address the pain Americans are feeling at the pump as a result of Putin’s Price Hike. The Administration’s strategy to spur the development of homegrown biofuels is critical to expanding Americans’ options for affordable fuel in the short-term and to building real energy independence in the long-term by reducing our reliance on fossil fuels. Today, the President is announcing new steps to achieve that goal by increasing fuel supplies, offering more consumer choices, and reducing gasoline prices for Americans.</p>



<p><em>Expanding Americans’ Access to Affordable Fuel Options This Summer</em></p>



<p>The President will announce today that the EPA Administrator is planning to allow E15 gasoline—gasoline that uses a 15 percent ethanol blend—to be sold this summer. This is the latest step in expanding Americans’ access to affordable fuel supply and bringing relief to Americans suffering from Putin’s Price Hike at the pump.</p>



<ul><li>To make E15 available in the summer, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is planning to issue a national, emergency waiver. Without this action, E15 cannot be used in most of the country from June 1<sup>st </sup>to September 15<sup>th</sup>, and the EPA plans to take final action to issue the emergency waiver closer to June 1<sup>st</sup>. E15 is currently offered at 2,300 gas stations in the country, where it can serve as an important—and more affordable—source of fuel.</li></ul>



<ul><li>An emergency waiver can help increase fuel supplies, give consumers more choice to get lower prices, and provide savings to many families. At current prices, E15 can save a family 10 cents per gallon of gas on average, and many stores sell E15 at an even greater discount. For working families—families eager to travel and visit their loved ones—that will add up to real savings. Allowing higher levels of blending will also reduce our dependency on foreign fuels as we rely more heavily on home-grown biofuels. This will help us bridge towards real energy independence.</li></ul>



<ul><li>In implementing this emergency fuel waiver, EPA will work with states across the country to ensure there are no significant air quality impacts through the summer driving season.</li></ul>



<ul><li>EPA is also considering additional action to facilitate the use of E15 year-round, including continued discussions with states who have expressed interest in allowing year-round use of E15 and considering modifications to E15 fuel pump labeling.</li></ul>



<p>The announcements today build on the steps the President has taken in recent weeks to address the Putin Price Hike and bring relief to Americans at the gas pump.</p>



<ul><li>President Biden worked with allies and partners through the International Energy Agency to authorize a historic release from petroleum reserves around the world, putting 240 million barrels of oil on the market in the next six months—more than one million barrels per day.</li></ul>



<ul><li>The President called for a “use it or lose it” policy to make oil companies pay fees on wells from their leases that they haven’t used in years and on acres of public lands that they are holding without producing.</li></ul>



<ul><li>The President put forward concrete steps to promote real independence from fossil fuels by accelerating the transition to clean energy, ranging from incentives for electric vehicles to Defense Production Act authority for large capacity batteries to a new partnership to reduce European reliance on natural gas.</li></ul>



<p><em>Enabling Energy Independence by Boosting Homegrown Biofuels</em></p>



<p>The President believes that the actions of a dictator half a world away should not impact what families pay at the pump here at home. Today’s actions also reinforce the Biden-Harris Administration’s goal of achieving real energy independence and commitment to a long-term strategy to spur smart development and adoption of sustainable, homegrown fuels.</p>



<p>The Administration has announced the following key steps:</p>



<ul><li><strong>$700 Million for Biofuels Producers</strong>: As part of the Pandemic Assistance for Producers initiative, USDA will provide up to $700 million in funding through a new Biofuel Producer Program. The Program will support agricultural producers that rely on biofuels producers as a market for their agricultural products. By making payments to producers of biofuels, the funding will help maintain a viable and significant market for such agricultural products. Producers can expect awards before the end of April.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>$5.6 million for Infrastructure for Renewable Fuels through the Higher Blends Infrastructure Incentive Program: </strong>To expand the infrastructure for renewable fuels derived from U.S. agricultural products, USDA is announcing $5.6 million in grants through <a href="https://www.rd.usda.gov/hbiip">the Higher Blends Infrastructure Incentive Program</a>. The purpose of the program is to significantly increase the sales and use of higher blends of ethanol and biodiesel. The awards being announced today will support 9 projects in 7 states.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>$100 Million for Biofuels Infrastructure</strong>: Investing in biofuels infrastructure ensures that market opportunities are available for sustainable fuel sources—and that those sustainable fuels can reach consumers. That is why USDA announced $100 million in new funding for grants for biofuels infrastructure. The funding will provide grants to refueling and distribution facilities for the cost of installation, retrofitting or otherwise upgrading of infrastructure required at a location to ensure the environmentally safe availability of fuel containing ethanol blends of E15 and greater or fuel containing biodiesel blends B-20 and greater. USDA will also make funding available to support biofuels for railways as a means of assisting with supply chains and helping to reduce costs for consumer goods and transportation.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Spurring a New Market in Sustainable Aviation Fuels</strong>: The Administration announced new actions to support sustainable aviation with a focus on low-carbon fuels that will create economic opportunity for agricultural communities. This included:<ul><li>A new Sustainable Aviation Fuel Grand Challenge to inspire the dramatic increase in the production of sustainable aviation fuels to at least 3 billion gallons per year by 2030;</li></ul><ul><li>New and ongoing funding opportunities to support sustainable aviation fuel projects and fuel producers totaling up to $4.3 billion; and</li></ul><ul><li>An increase in R&amp;D activities to demonstrate new technologies that can achieve at least a 30% improvement in aircraft fuel efficiency.</li></ul></li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Expanding Use of Canola Oil: </strong>Today, EPA is also announcing efforts to expand supply and choices for other forms of fuel, such as diesel and jet fuel. The Agency is proposing a new approval for canola oil that will add new pathways for fuels to participate in the Renewable Fuel Standard program to provide renewable diesel, jet fuel and other fuels. This action demonstrates EPA’s commitment to approving new petitions for renewable fuels that can provide greenhouse gas benefits as well as reduce reliance on petroleum fuels.</li></ul>



<p>These actions are critical to building real energy independence and protecting Americans from volatile prices by reducing our reliance on fossil fuels. Together, they will create good-paying jobs, support American agriculture and manufacturing, and accelerate the transition to clean energy.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Rose Garden</p>



<p>2:42 P.M. EDT<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Wow.&nbsp; Thank you, Madam Vice President, Deputy Attorney General Monaco.<br><br>And, Mia, you’re an incredible young woman.&nbsp; We spoke for a moment inside the Oval Office.&nbsp; And a lot of people here who have lost someone &#8212; and too many here have lost someone &#8212; know that no matter what the occasion, how celebratory or not it is, when you have to repeat it, you relive it like it just happened a moment ago.&nbsp; Your poise, your confidence, and your intellect are really impressive, honey.&nbsp; I mean, they really are.&nbsp; And, you know, I think most people here can tell you’ve gone through serious loss; that the best way to deal with it is to find purpose, and you found real purpose.&nbsp; And you are impressive.&nbsp;<br><br>And thank you for sharing your strength, for helping us remember your friend Dominic Blackwell and Gracie Muehlberger.&nbsp; You know, Dominic and Gracie’s parents are with us today.&nbsp;<br><br>Are you prepared to stand up if &#8212; I don’t want to embarrass you, but would you stand up?&nbsp; (Applause.) &nbsp;If you have a moment afterwards, maybe you can come into the Oval with me.&nbsp; If you wouldn’t mind, I’d like to talk to you.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Frank and Nancy, Bryan and Cindy, everyone here, as they say, feels your pain a little bit, particularly if they’ve suffered a serious loss.&nbsp; You’ve now joined a terrible fellowship of loss that many people have experienced.&nbsp;<br><br>There are too many survivors and advocates here for me to name everyone today, but let me say: The loss in this crowd is incalculable, but so is the strength &#8212; so is the strength.&nbsp; I believe our nation will be safer for your bravery, and I really mean that.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Survivors like Mia&nbsp;and Manny, and Claudia &#8212; a Los Angeles Deputy Sheriff who survived an ambush by a shooter with a ghost gun &#8212;&nbsp;represent individuals and families all across this country whose lives have been forever changed by a ghost gun.&nbsp; Some made national headlines; many others did not.<br><br>Today, we honor your strength and your action.<br><br>A year ago this week, standing here with many of you, I instructed the Attorney General to write a regulation that would<br>would rein in the proliferation of ghost guns because I was having trouble getting anything passed in the Congress, but I used what we call “regulatory authority.”<br><br>A year later, we’re here.&nbsp; We keep that promise.<br><br>The gun lobby tried to tie up the regulators in paperwork for a long, long time.&nbsp; The NRA called this rule I’m about to announce, “extreme.” &nbsp;“Extreme.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>But let me ask you: Is it extreme to protect police officers?&nbsp; Extreme to protect our children?&nbsp; Extreme to keep guns out of the hands of people who couldn’t even pass a background check?<br><br>AUDIENCE:&nbsp; Nooo &#8212;<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Look, the idea that someone on a terrorist list could purchase one of these guns is extreme?&nbsp; It isn’t extreme; it’s just basic common sense.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>You know, if you buy a couch you have to assemble, it’s still a couch.&nbsp; If you order a package, like this one over here, that includes the parts you need, the directions for assembling a functioning firearm, you bought a gun.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Take a look.&nbsp; Take a look at this.&nbsp; It comes in this package.&nbsp; You can see the picture down here maybe.&nbsp; This is the gun.&nbsp;<br><br>(Holds up upper and lower receivers of a handgun.)<br><br>It’s not hard to put together. &nbsp;A little drill &#8212; hand drill at home.&nbsp; It doesn’t take very long.&nbsp; Anyone can order it in the mail. &nbsp;Anyone.&nbsp;<br><br>And, folks, a felon, a terrorist, a domestic abuser can go from a gun kit to a gun in as little as 30 minutes.<br><br>Buyers aren’t required to pass background checks.&nbsp; Because guns have no serial numbers &#8212; these guns &#8212; when they show up at a crime scene, they can’t be traced.&nbsp; Harder to find and prove who used them.&nbsp; Meaning you can’t connect the gun to the shooter and hold them accountable.<br><br>In fact, the ATF reports that they’ve been able to trace less than 1 percent &#8212; less than 1 percent of ghost guns reported by law enforcement.&nbsp; And so it makes sense that police across the country are increasingly finding ghost guns at crime scenes.<br><br>And, by the way, ghost guns can be, quote, “rifles” &#8212; essentially assault weapons as well.&nbsp; This is one version of the kit you can buy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Last year alone, law enforcement reported approximately 20,000 suspected ghost guns to be &#8212; to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.&nbsp; That’s a tenfold increase in these ghost guns from 2016.&nbsp; Tenfold in five years.<br><br>These guns are weapons of choice for many criminals.&nbsp; We’re going to do everything we can to deprive them of that choice and, when we find them, put them in jail for a long, long time.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Law enforcement is sounding the alarms.&nbsp; Our communities are paying the price.&nbsp; And we’re acting.<br><br>Today, the United States Department of Justice is making it is illegal for a business to manufacture one of these kits without a serial number.&nbsp; Illegal.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Illegal for a licensed dealer to sell them without a background check.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>And starting today, weapons like the one used at Saugus<br>High School and to ambush deputies with us to- &#8212; that are here with us today are being treated like the deadly firearms they are.<br><br>And if somebody sells a ghost gun to a federally licensed dealer &#8212; for example, a pawn shop &#8212; that dealer must make the firearm and mark it with a serial number before reselling it.<br><br>All of a sudden, it’s no longer a ghost; it has a return address. &nbsp;And it’s going to help save lives, reduce crime, and get more criminals off the streets.&nbsp;<br><br>And this rule is only part of our strategy to go after ghost guns.&nbsp;<br><br>In February, the Department of Justice launched a nation &#8212; a National Gun &#8212; Ghost Guns Enforcement Initiative, intensifying our efforts to bring cases against those who use ghost guns illegally.&nbsp;<br><br>We’re teaching investigators and prosecutors best practices &#8212; how to build these cases &#8212; and assigning a coordinator in each of the ATF field divisions to serve as the point person for helping federal, state, and local law enforcement go after ghost guns.<br><br>If you commit a crime with a ghost gun, expect federal prosecution, not just state. &nbsp;Expect federal prosecution.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>This rule is an important step.&nbsp; It’s going to make a difference, I promise you.&nbsp; And there are a lot of other things we know work to reduce gun violence and other violent crimes and save lives.<br><br>That’s why I’ve put together a comprehensive strategy&nbsp;to supercharge what works while continuing to push Congress to act on sensible legislation to prevent gun violence.<br><br>In addition to today &#8212; in addition to today’s rule, we’re working on four areas:<br><br>First, we’re going after rogue gun dealers.&nbsp; The last time we had data on this was more than 20 years ago. &nbsp;Five percent of gun dealers sold 90 percent of illegal guns&nbsp;found at crime scenes.&nbsp; Five percent sold 90 percent.</p>



<p>These merchants of death are breaking the law for profit and selling guns that are killing innocent people.<br><br>We&#8217;re cracking down on these gun dealers and the violent criminals they knowingly arm.</p>



<p>Second, we&#8217;re disrupting illegal gun trafficking.&nbsp; Attorney General Garland has directed all U.S. Attorneys to prioritize combatting gun trafficking that is moving guns across state lines and city boundaries.<br><br>The Justice Department is surging prosecutorial resources to help shut down these trafficking corridors, including the one known as the “Iron Pipeline” that funnels weapons &#8212; (applause) &#8212; from gun shops in states like Georgia to crime scenes up and down the East Coast.<br><br>Thirdly, we’re funding strategies we know reduce gun crime: community policing and community violence interruption.<br><br>Look, I’ve said it many times: The answer is not to defund the police.&nbsp; It’s to fund the police and give them the tools and training to support &#8212; they need to be the partners and the protectors of our communities in need.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>And I’ve already made clear that I want cities, states, counties, and Tribes to use some of the $350 billion we sent to them in the American Rescue Plan &#8212; that I wrote in the first month &#8212; to reduce gun violence, hire police officers for community policing, pay police overtime, purchase crime-fighting technologies.&nbsp; They were given the money.&nbsp; They can do it.&nbsp; Spend it.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>And now, on top of that, I’m calling for additional funding to put police on the streets for community policing.&nbsp; One thing we learned in the middle of the crime wave not long ago: When the cop knows by first name who owns the corner drug store, who lives in the apartment above 6B, who the people who are &#8212; the pastors of the churches, guess what?&nbsp; People talk to them.&nbsp; They trust them.<br><br>My son was the Attorney General in Delaware. &nbsp;He&#8217;d go around and make sure everybody, literally, in these high-crime-rate neighborhoods &#8212; he&#8217;d give them his personal cell phone number and instructed all of the cops to do the same thing.&nbsp; And they did.&nbsp; And the crime plummeted.&nbsp; Not a joke.&nbsp; Look at the record.&nbsp; Not just my son, but all across the nation.<br><br>And for the&nbsp;<s>AFT</s>&nbsp;[ATF] to hire agents they need to help the fight gun crime &#8212; more agents.</p>



<p>My budget funds body cameras and makes sure police work with our local communities and are accountable to the local communities.</p>



<p>We’re also investing in community violence intervention.&nbsp; These are areas, local programs that utilize trusted messengers &#8212; community members and leaders &#8212; to work directly with people who are the most likely to commit a gun crime or become victims of gun crime &#8212; get to them early.&nbsp; It works.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; It works.&nbsp; They intervene before it’s too late.<br><br>Fourth, we’re funding jobs and training for young people, summer programs, drug treatment, mental health, housing availability, criminal justice reform, and reentry support for people coming home after incarceration.</p>



<p>Right now, you get let out of prison after serving your time; you get a bus ticket and 25 bucks.&nbsp; You end up under the same bridge you left 2, 5, 10 years earlier.&nbsp; If you serve your time, you qualify for Pell Grants, you qualify for housing, you’re qualified for food, you qualify to get back into the community &#8212; give them a fighting chance.</p>



<p>These are all demonstrated ways to reduce crime.&nbsp; And I’m strongly urging cities, states, counties, and Tribes to use the Rescue Plan funding we’ve sent them to do more in each of these areas.&nbsp; And they need to do more and do it quickly, before the summer, when crime typically surges around America.</p>



<p>So we’re pushing in each of these areas, but none of this absolves Congress &#8212; with all due respect to my members of Congress here; they’re the wrong people I’d be talking to &#8212; for their responsibility to act.<br><br>We need Congress to pass universal background checks.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Universal background checks.&nbsp;<br><br>And I know it’s controversial, but I got it done once: Ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I was getting criticized when I first passed this law when I was a senator.&nbsp; And guess what?&nbsp; I was down in southern Delaware &#8212; they do a lot of hunting and fishing down there &#8212; and I was walking up one of the creek beds.&nbsp; And a guy standing said, “You want to take my gun?”&nbsp; I said, “I don’t want to take your gun.”&nbsp; He said, “Well, you’re telling me I can’t have more than X number of bullets in a &#8212; in a &#8212; in my gun.”&nbsp; And I said, “What &#8212; do you think the deer you’re hunting wear Kevlar vests?&nbsp; What the hell you need 20 bullets for?&nbsp; You must be a hell of a terrible shot.”&nbsp; (Laughter.)</p>



<p>No, I’m serious.&nbsp; Think about it.&nbsp; Think about the mass shootings.&nbsp; As many as a hundred rounds.&nbsp; It’s a weapon of war.&nbsp; It has nothing to do with recreation.</p>



<p>Outright banning the sale and possession of un-serialized guns.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Eliminate gun manufacturers’ immunity from liability.&nbsp; They’re the only outfit &#8212; (applause) &#8212; they’re the only outfit in the country that is immune.</p>



<p>Imagine had the tobacco industry been immune to prost- &#8212; to being sued.&nbsp; Come on.</p>



<p>In February, the families of nine of the Sandy Hook shooting victims achieved a settlement against the maker of guns that was used to kill their children.</p>



<p>The Sandy &#8212; Sandy Hook folks are here.&nbsp; Do you &#8212; will you be embarrassed if I ask you to stand up?&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; These folks right here did more to keep all of this going than anybody.&nbsp; We owe you, man.&nbsp; We owe you.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; It never goes away, does it?&nbsp; God love you.</p>



<p>Look, this is incredibly rare because gun manufacturers have more immunity from liability than any other American industry, so they have never had to take responsibility for the death and destruction their products cause.&nbsp; But as part of this settlement, Remington agreed to release thousands of pages of internal documents.</p>



<p>You did that.</p>



<p>And why &#8212; here’s why it’s so important: Remember, it wasn’t until we saw the internal documents that we really understood what cigarette manufacturers were doing to our kids and to our families.<br><br>Now we may begin to see what gun manufacturers are and are not doing when it comes to making and marketing their deadly products.<br><br>And, by the way &#8212; it’s going to sound bizarre &#8212; I support the Second Amendment.&nbsp; You have a right.&nbsp; But from the very beginning, the Second Amendment didn’t say you can own any gun you want, big as you want.&nbsp; You couldn’t buy a cannon when, in fact, the Second Amendment passed.&nbsp; And certain people from the very beginning weren’t allowed to purchase guns.&nbsp; It’s nothing new.&nbsp; It’s just rational.</p>



<p>Look, this should be just the start.&nbsp; We need to repeal the liability shield of gun manufacturers and finally hold them accountable for false advertising and many other things they do.<br><br>There’s one more action I’m taking today.<br><br>It’s only been &#8212; and there’s been only one Senate who has confirmed a director of Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives in the Bureau’s entire history.&nbsp; It used to be it didn’t require Senate action when I first got to the Senate.&nbsp; But it’s only been one since it became required confirmation.</p>



<p>This is an agency whose mission it is to protect communities from violent criminals, illegal trafficking of firearms, acts of arson and bombing, and a lot more.&nbsp; The mission of this agency isn’t controversial, it’s public safety.</p>



<p>Today, to lead and support the dedicated men and women of the&nbsp;<s>AFT</s>&nbsp;[ATF], I am proud to nominate Steve Del- &#8212; Dettelbach &#8212; excuse me, I mispronounced your name &#8212; I just &#8212; as Director of Bureau of Al- &#8212; Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.</p>



<p>Steve is immensely qualified.&nbsp; He served the Department of Justice for two decades.&nbsp; He worked side by side to support the work of federal, state, and local law enforcement, including<s>AFT</s>&nbsp;[ATF] agents.&nbsp; And one of those was he &#8212; a case he was &#8212; personally tried as a U.S. Attorney, where the serial arsonist firebombed the courthouses and police headquarters in Mansfield, Ohio.</p>



<p>For his work, Steve got death threats, but the defendant got 60 years.</p>



<p>Steve also partnered with the community leaders and law enforcement to help prevent violent crime.&nbsp; He’s worked with the police to combat domestic extremism and to take violent criminals off the street.<br><br>Steve’s record makes him ready on day one to lead this agency.<br><br>And, by the way, in 2009, the U.S. Senate unanimously confirmed him to serve as a U.S. Attorney.&nbsp; I look forward to working with the Senate to get him confirmed once again.</p>



<p>With what I’ve &#8212; know about him and why I was enthusiastic about supporting him, I’d like to introduce my nominee to lead the&nbsp;<s>AFT</s>&nbsp;[ATF] to you &#8212; all of you.&nbsp; Steve, come on up here.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>MR. DETTELBACH:&nbsp; Thank you, Mr. President; thank you, Vice President Harris, for your leadership in protecting the people of this nation and for placing your trust in me to become the next director of the ATF.&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br><br>Thank you, also, Deputy Attorney General Monaco, for all that you and Attorney General Garland continue to do at DOJ to make our nation safer.&nbsp;<br><br>And thank you, Mia, for your incredible inspiration and courage not just here today, but all over this nation.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>I also want to thank my incredible, supportive, and often patient family who are here.&nbsp; My wonderful wife, Karil, and my children, Allie and David.&nbsp; Please.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; When he&#8217;s 16 years old, I want to draft him.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;<br><br>MR. DETTELBACH:&nbsp; Is there an agent in the house?&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;<br><br>But seriously, more &#8212; most especially today, I want to thank the men and women of the ATF.&nbsp;<br><br>You know, I started as a career prosecutor back in 1992.&nbsp; And I have spent three decades watching and admiring agents and staff at the ATF &#8212; along with its federal, state, and local law enforcement partners &#8212; as they work tirelessly and courageously to protect the American people.&nbsp;<br><br>I would also say they work in anonymity, but that would not be completely true because, sadly, one thing I&#8217;ve also seen over the years is that the ATF often does work in anonymity when its agents are out there risking their lives to protect us only to be thrust into the public eye when it&#8217;s time for criticism.&nbsp;<br><br>You know, law enforcement is a very tough job, and no person and no agency is perfect.&nbsp; But the President is right: The men and women of the ATF and the public that they protect deserve better support from us.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br><br>I&#8217;ve seen firsthand the work that so many at the ATF do to protect us from violence.&nbsp; They&#8217;re dedicated, they&#8217;re professional, and they&#8217;re effective.&nbsp; They don&#8217;t write the laws; their mission every day is just to go out and enforce those laws and protect the public from a wide range of threats.&nbsp;<br><br>When I was a U.S. Attorney, our office partnered with the ATF and the Cleveland Police as they doggedly investigated and brought a case involving the deadliest home arson in Cleveland history &#8212; killed nine people, including eight kids.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>I also saw the ATF partner with the FBI and our office, first to find and then to bring to justice a bigot who drove from Indiana to outside Toledo to torch the largest mosque in Ohio.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>And last and certainly not least, I have partnered with the ATF for decades in its crucial fight against gun violence.&nbsp;<br><br>You know, whether it was taking a single violent recidivist off the street in Maryland or putting together a big racketeering case against a violent gang in Youngstown, Ohio, I have seen the ATF work with other law enforcement to make so many of our communities safer.&nbsp;<br><br>As we emerge from this pandemic, we’ve got to recognize that many Americans still face fear and isolation not because of a virus, but because of an epidemic of firearms violence.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not a new problem, and it has many causes.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s going to take an all-hands-on-deck-partnership approach to address that issue.&nbsp; And the ATF will be there.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>If confirmed, I promise to support the men and the women of the ATF and to do everything in our power to protect the people of this nation every single day.&nbsp;<br><br>Thank you.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; All right, good job.&nbsp;<br><br>MR. DETTELBACH:&nbsp; Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Thank you all for coming.&nbsp;<br><br>And, by the way, he was responsible for the weather as well.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Thank you, thank you, thank you.<br><br>MR. DETTELBACH:&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>3:05 P.M. EDT</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Via Teleconference</p>



<p>12:39&nbsp;P.M. EDT</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Great, thank you.&nbsp; And thank everyone for joining.&nbsp; So, as a reminder, this call is on background, attributable to a senior administration official, and the contents of the call are embargoed until the end of the call.</p>



<p>For your awareness and not for reporting, our speaker on the call today is [senior administration official].&nbsp; So, with that, I’ll turn it over to you for some quick remarks at the top, and then we’ll take some questions.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; Thanks, [moderator], and thank you to everyone for joining.&nbsp; As [moderator] said, I will do some remarks and we&#8217;ll do a few questions afterwards.</p>



<p>I just wanted to talk about the meeting that President Biden just held with Prime Minister Modi.&nbsp; He met virtually with Prime Minister Modi, and this is ahead of the U.S.-India 2+2 ministerial that Secretary Blinken and Secretary Austin are holding today with their Indian counterparts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>President Biden last spoke to Prime Minister Modi in early March, along with other Quad leaders.&nbsp; And as you all remember, President Biden welcomed Prime Minister Modi in person to the White House last September.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During the course of the meeting, President Biden affirmed that our partnership with India is one of our most important relationships, and the two leaders had a chance to have an hourlong, very candid conversation to discuss a range of bilateral and global issues.&nbsp; The meeting was warm and productive, and they covered a lot of ground.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The leaders were able to talk about joint efforts on the global effort to end the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp; They talked about climate.&nbsp; They talked about strengthening the global economy.&nbsp; And they talked about upholding a free and open Indo-Pacific, including the development of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework and infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And President Biden also took the opportunity to continue the close consultations we&#8217;ve been having with India at a number of different levels across our government and over the course of many weeks on Russia&#8217;s brutal war against Ukraine.&nbsp; The U.S. and India are partnering and consulting on mitigating the most destabilizing impacts, both on global food supply and other commodity markets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And throughout the course of the 2+2, today, Secretary Blinken and Secretary Austin, of course, will have the chance to go over these issues and many more, including sanctions compliance &#8212; again, including cooperation on food supply, including energy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And the 2+2 will cover also science and technology partnership initiatives.&nbsp; They’ll cover people-to-people ties.&nbsp; They will cover counterterrorism; operationalizing the Major Defense Partnership; new domains of cooperation in space and cyber and emerging technologies; and multilateral cooperation.</p>



<p>But the leaders meeting at the top was a very useful touchpoint for the two of them to share perspective on a range of issues.</p>



<p>So, let me stop there and take a couple of questions.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; Can we cue up the directions to ask a question, please?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Could you talk a little bit about whether there was any discussion on the call about the energy purchases that India is making from Russia, and whether those need to stop and whether there&#8217;s any formal kind of agreement about what that would look like?&nbsp; Thank you very much.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; The two leaders covered the whole range of issues related to Russia-Ukraine.&nbsp; It was a very candid conversation.&nbsp; I think you will have seen &#8212; even in Prime Minister Modi&#8217;s remarks at the top to press, he talked about it as well.&nbsp; They were very direct conversations.</p>



<p>On the energy issues: Of course, it&#8217;s a subject of discussion.&nbsp; We&#8217;re aware of what India &#8212; you know, we haven&#8217;t asked India to do anything in particular; we&#8217;re having a very open conversation.&nbsp; We know that not all countries will be able to do what we&#8217;ve done.&nbsp; We know that India is not a major consumer of Russian oil.&nbsp; Its current imports are about 1 to 2 percent of its total energy imports.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, as of now, our energy payments &#8212; our energy payments are exempt from current sanctions.&nbsp; And we&#8217;ve been very clear that we&#8217;ve been able to ban oil and LNG and coal imports from Russia, but other countries have to make their own choices.</p>



<p>That said, we don’t think India should accelerate or increase imports of Russian energy.&nbsp; And the U.S. is ready to support India, remain in a conversation with India about its diversification of imports.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey there.&nbsp; Following up on the last question, but maybe in a &#8212; in a little bit broader way: India has obviously been among the nations that had been more reticent to speak out against the war in Ukraine.&nbsp; They&#8217;ve obviously abstained from several votes at the U.N., including the vote the other day to withdraw &#8212; to remove Russia from the Human Rights Council.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What &#8212; did the President bring that up?&nbsp; Did the President &#8212; is this an opportunity for the President to try to push India to be &#8212; you know, essentially to take a side here, as opposed to the sort of neutral position that they&#8217;ve taken?&nbsp; Did he specifically do that?&nbsp; Did he specifically ask India to take a side?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; So, India is going to make its own judgments.&nbsp; Prime Minister Modi brought up the situation, again, in his public remarks, and there was discussion.&nbsp; I mean, the President shared his views, and Prime Minister Modi shared his views.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You will have seen in recent days that India made some pretty strong statements in New York condemning the killings of civilians, supporting calls for an independent investigation.&nbsp; India is also providing humanitarian relief material to Ukraine, including medicine and other supplies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There were close consultations in early days about the Indian students that were &#8212; needed to be evacuated from Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So we&#8217;re going to continue these discussions with India.&nbsp; I think India will make its own decisions, but we&#8217;re going to continue the discussions.</p>



<p>And as I mentioned earlier, there were conversations about how to mitigate the destabilizing impacts of Putin&#8217;s war, including on food supply, where India is in a position to assist &#8212; has done some things, and there was discussion about what more India might be able to do.</p>



<p>Q    Hi.  Thank you, guys.  Sort of following up, actually, on both the prior questions &#8212; I was wondering if any explicit commitments were made by India in regards either on oil but more broadly.  I know you said that the Prime Minister made some comments at the beginning that were public where he seemed to use stronger words to condemn Russia&#8217;s behavior.  Was that a sort of satisfactory condemnation from the Biden administration&#8217;s perspective?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; What I&#8217;ll say is that Prime Minister Modi took the opportunity to share his views in a pretty candid way about what&#8217;s going on.&nbsp;<br><br>We know that Russia has concerns &#8212; we know that India has concerns about the links between Russia and China.&nbsp; India, of course, is facing a very tense situation along the Line of Actual Control.&nbsp; And when India sees the tight links between China and Russia, that&#8217;s obviously going to impact their thinking.<br><br>Whether there was &#8212; there was no sort of concrete ask and concrete answer, but the leaders were able to step back and have a pretty detailed and candid exchange of views.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, thank you.&nbsp; Thank you for doing this.&nbsp; I wanted to ask you if the neighborhood was discussed, because the situations in both Sri Lanka and Pakistan is not that very good.&nbsp; Did that issue came up for discussion, and what was it?<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Yes, the leaders did discuss developments in the region, in South Asia.&nbsp; They touched on some of the developments in Sri Lanka, in Bangladesh.&nbsp; And I know that our State Department colleagues will be able to follow up on those discussions.&nbsp; It wasn&#8217;t a detailed discussion by the leaders, but it did come up.&nbsp; And I am positive there will be more detailed discussions throughout the course of the next day and a half.</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; All right.&nbsp; Well, thanks, everyone, for joining.&nbsp; As a reminder, this call was on background, attributable to a “senior administration official.”&nbsp; And the embargo on the call will lift at the end of this call.&nbsp;<br><br>If you have any other questions, please feel free to reach out to me and we&#8217;ll make sure to get back to you.&nbsp;<br><br>Thanks, everyone.</p>

<p>11:24 A.M. EDT<br> <br>PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Prime Minister Modi, it’s always good to see you.  I’m looking forward to seeing you in Japan, about the 24th of May.  And I was honored to welcome you to the White House last September to discuss U.S.-India relations, to meet with our fellow Quad leaders.  <br> <br>And I&#8217;m pleased to have this opportunity to speak with you today virtually and with your two ministers and your ambassador here in person.  <br> <br>(Referring to the language interpretation.)  Is it contemporaneous? <br> <br>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  Yes, (inaudible).<br> <br>PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Oh, I&#8217;m sorry.  (Laughs.)<br> <br>As two vibrant democracies who &#8212; one is learning how to make sure I can do this contemporaneously, but &#8212; two vibrant democracies, we have a &#8212; we take the same concerns about the global challenges we face &#8212; from COVID-19, advancing health security, and tracking the climate crisis &#8212; and we share a strong and growing Major Defense Partnership. <br> <br>At the root of our partnership is a deep connection between our people &#8212; ties of family, of friendship, and of shared values.  <br> <br>On that note, I want to welcome India&#8217;s humanitarian support for the people of Ukraine, who are suffering a horrific assault, including a tragic shelling in a train station last week that killed dozens of innocent children and women and civilians attempting to flee the violence.<br> <br>The United States and India are going to continue our close consultation on how to manage the destabilizing effects of this Russian war.  <br> <br>And I&#8217;m looking forward to our discussions today, Mr. Prime Minister.  Our continued consultation and dialogue are key to ensuring the U.S.-India relationship continues to grow deeper and stronger, delivering our people and our global good &#8212; good that we all are seeking to manage, particularly in your part of the world. <br> <br>And the floor is yours, Mr. Prime Minister.<br> <br>PRIME MINISTER MODI:  (As interpreted.)  President Biden, I would like to, first of all, express my gratitude to you for your warm words.  Our defense and foreign ministers will be meeting today in the 2+2 format in a short while from now.<br> <br>Our meeting before that is very important, as it will provide direction for the discussions.  I also appreciate your initiative to organize today&#8217;s virtual meeting.<br> <br>Excellency, when I was in Washington last year in September &#8212; and you, in fact, mentioned that &#8212; you had said at the time that the India-America partnership can contribute to solving a lot of global problems.  I totally agree with you.<br> <br>As two democracies that are the world’s largest and oldest, we are natural partners.  And the progress that has taken place in our relations in the last few years, the new momentum that has been created would have been hard to even imagine a few decades ago.<br> <br>Excellency, our talks today are taking place at a time when the situation in Ukraine is very worrying.<br> <br>A few weeks ago, over 20,000 Indians were stuck in Ukraine, and most of them were young students.  After a lot of hard work, we were successful in getting them all out safely.  One student, however, lost his life.<br> <br>During this entire process, I spoke several times on the phone to the presidents of both Ukraine and Russia.  I not only appealed for peace, but also suggested that there be direct talks between President Putin and the President of Ukraine.<br> <br>We had extensive discussions on Ukraine in our parliament as well. <br> <br>Recently, the news about the killings of innocent civilians in the Bucha city was very worrying.  We instantly condemned the killings and have called for an independent inquiry.  <br> <br>We hope that the ongoing discussions between Russia and Ukraine will lead to peace.<br> <br>Excellency, we have also emphasized the importance of the security of civilians in Ukraine and the unhindered supply of humanitarian assistance to them &#8212; and you mentioned this, in fact. <br> <br>On our part, we have sent medicines and other relief material to Ukraine and to its neighboring countries.  And on Ukraine&#8217;s request, we will be sending them another consignment of medicines very soon.<br> <br>Excellency, at the beginning of your term in office, you’d used a very important slogan: “Democracies can deliver.”  The India-America partnership and the success of the India-America partnership is the best means to make this slogan meaningful.<br> <br>This year, India is celebrating 75 years of its independence, and we are also celebrating the 75th anniversary of our diplomatic relations as well.  I am confident that our friendship with America will be an integral part of India&#8217;s development journey over the next 25 years.<br> <br>Once again, my thanks to you for organizing this event.<br> <br>PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister.  We&#8217;re going to hold for just a moment, Mr. Prime Minister, while the press leaves the room.  <br> <br>11:31 A.M. EDT</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>President Biden is committed to creating an economy that works for every American. Part of that agenda is to ensure that families in Puerto Rico are treated fairly in our tax system. Historically, the prior Child Tax Credit (CTC) only applied to families in Puerto Rico with three or more qualifying children, and therefore only 10% of families with children were eligible.<br>&nbsp;<br>That changed when President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan (ARP). It not only provided the largest Child Tax Credit nationwide to the most ever families, it also made sure that, for the first time, families and children in Puerto Rico fully benefited – permanently fixing the credit to give Puerto Rico families equal access. This tax filing season, 97% of Puerto Rico families with children are now eligible for the expanded CTC. The law also <em><u>permanently</u></em> changed the structure of the CTC so that every child in Puerto Rico will get the credit on the same basis as all other American children. This will mean that parents in Puerto Rico will have, as President Biden says, a “little more breathing room” in meeting the costs of raising a family and that there will be fewer children in Puerto Rico living in poverty.<br>&nbsp;<br>The ARP also meant a historic expansion of the federal government’s commitment to expand the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) in Puerto Rico. Together, the expanded CTC and EITC could provide an estimated $1 billion annually in critical benefits to hundreds of thousands of low- and moderate-income working people and families in Puerto Rico.<br>&nbsp;<br>Today, as part of a final push to encourage families in Puerto Rico to file their taxes and receive both the CTC and EITC, First Lady Dr. Jill Biden, Education Secretary Miguel Cardona, House Chairwoman Nydia Velazquez, Deputy Secretary of Treasury Wally Adeyemo, and American Rescue Plan Coordinator Gene Sperling are holding a special virtual event with UnidosUS, the Hispanic Federation, the Institute of Youth Development/Instituto del Desarrollo de la Juventud (IDJ), Espacios Abiertos, and United Way of Puerto Rico. The Biden Administration and these leading non-profits are urging families to file their taxes by April 18<sup>th</sup> to take advantage of this critical aid.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>The American Rescue Plan made historic, permanent changes to the Child Tax Credit for Puerto Rico families – making the credit available to 97% of Puerto Rico families this year, compared to 10% before the ARP</strong></p>



<ul><li>Previously, <strong><em><u>only Puerto Rico families with three or more qualifying children or more qualified for any Child Tax Credit benefit</u></em></strong>.<br></li><li>This meant that before the American Rescue Plan, <strong><em><u>only about 10% of Puerto Rico families qualified for any Child Tax Credit.<br></u></em></strong></li><li>The ARP permanently changed that policy to extend the CTC to Puerto Rico families with fewer than three qualifying children who were previously excluded. <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/blog/tax-credit-expansions-expected-to-significantly-reduce-poverty-in-puerto-rico">As a result</a> of the ARP, <strong><em><u>97% of Puerto Rico families with children are eligible for the 2021 Child Tax Credit.<br></u></em></strong></li><li>For 2021, the ARP increased the Child Tax Credit to <strong><em><u>$3,600 per child under 6 and $3,000 per child 6-17</u></em></strong> – and ensured that lower income families could access the full credit.<br></li><li>In addition, the ARP provided the first-ever federal support for Puerto Rico’s local Earned Income Tax Credit – allowing Puerto Rico to <strong><u>more than</u></strong> triple EITC <strong><u>benefits</u></strong> and extend <strong><u>the EITC</u></strong> to more workers for the next 10 years.</li></ul>



<p>Together, the ARP’s expansions of the CTC and EITC are&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-tax/american-rescue-plan-act-provides-critical-permanent-tax-relief-to-puerto-rico">estimated</a>&nbsp;to <strong>provide over $1 billion in tax relief</strong> per year going forward. They stand to benefit hundreds of thousands of Puerto Rico families – with the families of over 500,000 children eligible for the 2021 expanded CTC.<br><br><strong>Today’s event builds on substantial White House-Treasury Department efforts to ensure access to the 2021 Child Tax Credit in Puerto Rico:</strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>The White House and Treasury Department in collaboration with UnidosUS created a Weekly CTC/EITC Puerto Rico Working Group, with the Youth Development Institute (IDJ), Espacios Abiertos, Hispanic Federation, and others, to increase awareness and take up rates</strong> among newly eligible families in Puerto Rico for the CTC and Local EITC. This group is comprised of representatives of the Puerto Rico government, Hacienda (the local tax authority), Treasury, IRS, and local stakeholders — including community-based organizations and other advocates in Puerto Rico – who work to remove barriers for the implementation of tax credit policies. Collaboration across these groups has already led to the execution or launch of over 35 local community events, navigator trainings and capacity building engagements for local elected officials and municipal staff. More than 240 municipal and state agencies employees were trained to scale and implement integrated outreach strategies and provide free tax preparation services for low-to-middle income communities.<br></li><li><strong>The White House and Treasury Department collaborated closely with the Governor of Puerto Rico, Mayors, foundations and NGOs on the island to increase awareness and CTC sign-ups in Puerto Rico. </strong>The White House ARP Implementation Coordinator, White House Intergovernmental Affairs and Treasury teams met twice at the White House with the Governor of Puerto Rico on CTC outreach strategy and had several meetings with top Puerto Rican mayors. The White House ARP Implementation Team also organized several meetings with foundations on the importance of investing in CTC outreach in Puerto Rico.<br></li><li><strong>The Administration launched a stand-alone section of ChildTaxCredit.gov for Puerto Rico families and outreach partners. </strong><a href="https://www.childtaxcredit.gov/es/puerto-rico/">Childtaxcredit.gov/es/puerto-rico/</a> highlights the unique and unprecedented access for families with children to benefit from the enhanced CTC and provides information on how to claim the credit in plain language, Spanish, and a mobile friendly format.<br></li><li><strong>The Treasury Department and the White House worked to build capacity for Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) Centers and Facilitated Self-Assistance (FSA) Sites</strong>, including through navigator training and volunteer recruitment scale-up for tax prep assistance in low income communities. Currently there are 43 tax assistance sites, including VITA and FSA in the island.<br></li><li><strong>The Administration amplified the island-wide public campaign by the Alliance for Economic Security in Puerto Rico, and garnering support from state/local government. </strong>The Alliance, composed by the Hispanic Federation, Instituto del Desarrollo de la Juventud (IDJ) and Espacios Abiertos coalesced to launch &nbsp;<a href="https://reclamatudineropr.com/">ReclamaTuDineroPR.com</a> to further promote awareness of these tax benefits. In addition, the Administration has helped amplify these efforts and match trained IRS volunteers with Mayors and municipalities to host “Fill-a-thons” (“Llenatones” in Spanish) &#8211; to ensure all families with children learn about the credit and can receive tax filing assistance through a local community event.&nbsp;<br></li><li><strong>Treasury provided training for mayors in Puerto Rico on how to leverage ARP State &amp; Fiscal Recovery Funds (SLFRF) to do CTC and EITC outreach and tax filing assistance outreach </strong>in collaboration with the White House, the Government of Puerto Rico, the Association of Mayors, and the Federation of Mayors of Puerto Rico to maximize critical State and Local ARP funds for local governments in Puerto Rico.</li></ul>

Biden, Jr. announced that former U.S. Senator Christopher Dodd of Connecticut and former U.S. Representative Debbie Mucarsel-Powell of Florida will serve as special advisors for the Ninth Summit of the Americas that will take place from June 6 through June 10 in Los Angeles, California.</p>



<p>Senator Dodd served as a member and Chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere for over three decades. Senator Dodd and President Biden worked closely together on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for over 28 years. Senator Dodd’s interest in Latin America began years before his election to the U.S. Congress. In the 1960s, Dodd joined President John Kennedy’s Peace Corps, serving for two years as a volunteer in the Dominican Republic. During his service in the Peace Corps and in the Senate, he traveled extensively and on numerous occasions throughout the hemisphere.</p>



<p>As the first and only Latina Democrat to ever represent a Congressional district in Florida, and the first-ever Member of Congress born in Ecuador, Congresswoman Mucarsel-Powell was a leading voice in the charge to support Venezuelans fleeing their country through securing Temporary Protected Status in the United States and providing humanitarian and other aid to the Venezuelan people and neighboring countries. She served as chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Women’s Task Force and also sponsored environmental and public health legislation.</p>



<p>Senator Dodd and Congresswoman Mucarsel-Powell are confident that President Biden will renew and strengthen the collaboration and respect essential for a bright future for the Americas at the upcoming Summit in Los Angeles this June.</p>



<p>The Summit of the Americas, the only meeting that brings together the leaders of North, South, and Central America and the Caribbean, will play a central role in shaping the future of the Americas at a critical time in our history.&nbsp; The region’s governments, civil society, and private sector will work to develop a shared vision built around the theme for this year’s meeting, “Building a Sustainable, Resilient, and Equitable Future.”</p>



<p>The United States looks forward to welcoming the hemisphere to Los Angeles to work together on strengthening our democracies, building more prosperous and inclusive economies, and better protecting the human rights, health, dignity, and security of our people.  The United States previously hosted the inaugural Summit of the Americas in Miami, Florida, in 1994.</p>

<p>As we work together to build a better America, we must remember that education is the key to achieving greater opportunity, prosperity, stability, and equality both here and around the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;A high-quality education develops the mind, opens the heart, nurtures our talents, and fortifies our character.&nbsp;&nbsp;Through education, we learn to recognize ourselves in our neighbors and cherish the dignity of our shared human experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;No one understood this better than the man whose life and legacy we celebrate on this day:&nbsp;&nbsp;Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the Lubavitcher Rebbe and leader of the Chabad-Lubavitch movement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Rebbe&#8217;s devotion to educating people worldwide and his profound respect for diversity, inclusiveness, and equal justice have set a strong example for generations of Americans and people across the globe.  Having survived one of history&#8217;s cruelest chapters, the Rebbe emerged determined to help heal the soul of humanity.  He left his mark as a thinker, leader, and teacher who recognized the limitless potential of every human being regardless of their background.  His outreach is still felt today in countless houses of worship, centers of education, cultural exchanges, and service communities worldwide.</p>



<p>The Rebbe&#8217;s work reminds us, in the words of the Prophet Amos, to &#8220;hate evil, love good, and establish justice in the gate.&#8221;  We each share a responsibility to live up to those words &#8212; in and out of the classroom &#8212; and to plant the seeds of love, kindness, and empathy in the hearts and minds of every child in America.  </p>



<p>To ensure that our children are provided every opportunity to learn and grow, my Administration provided resources through the American Rescue Plan for schools to safely reopen for in-person instruction.  Today, thanks to our COVID-19 strategy and the resilience of local communities, more than 99 percent of America&#8217;s schools are open again.  But if we are truly going to build a better America, we must continue to make transformational investments in education &#8212; including making high-quality pre-school available to every 3- and 4-year old in America and coming together to address the invisible toll on children&#8217;s mental health that was exacerbated by the pandemic.</p>



<p>Today &#8212; on what would have been the Rebbe&#8217;s 120th birthday &#8212; let us celebrate all the educators, advocates, and pioneers who teach young people the lessons that create caring neighbors and closer communities.  Let us commit to learning together, sharing the best we have to offer, and working in unity for the common good. </p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 12, 2022, as Education and Sharing Day, USA.&nbsp;&nbsp;I call upon all government officials, educators, volunteers, and all the people of the United States to observe this day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.</p>



<p>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eleventh day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-sixth.                               </p>

					<description><![CDATA[Today, the White House released a Bipartisan Infrastructure Law Rural Playbook to help state, local, Tribal and territorial governments in rural areas unlock the benefits from the historic investments in our nation’s infrastructure and launched a rural infrastructure tour led by the President and other senior administration officials to engage rural communities across the country.&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>Today, the White House released a Bipartisan Infrastructure Law <a href="https://build.gov/rural">Rural Playbook</a> to help state, local, Tribal and territorial governments in rural areas unlock the benefits from the historic investments in our nation’s infrastructure and launched a rural infrastructure tour led by the President and other senior administration officials to engage rural communities across the country.</p>



<p>The Rural Playbook, found at build.gov/rural, builds on the release of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law Guidebook and provides rural communities with information on the “what, when, where, and how to apply” for funding under the law – so no community needs to hire a lobbyist to access their government. The Playbook also identifies over 100 programs funded under the law with federal cost share flexibilities and matching requirement waivers.</p>



<p>During the month of April, Biden Administration officials will travel to dozens of rural communities as part of a Building A Better America rural infrastructure tour to talk about the impact of Bipartisan Infrastructure Law investments, as well as the President’s broader commitment to ensure federal resources reach all communities in rural America. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, EPA Administrator Michael Regan, Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Infrastructure Coordinator Mitch Landrieu will take part in events, along with other senior administration officials.</p>



<p>President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will send billions of dollars to rural communities across the country. Supporting Americans living in rural areas remains a top priority for the Biden Administration, and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law delivers on the President’s promises to provide high speed internet, safe roads and bridges, modern wastewater systems, clean drinking water, reliable and affordable electricity, and good paying jobs in every rural community. As part of this effort, the Biden Administration is also committed to working with communities to help them access federal resources and improving transparency.</p>



<p>“This Rural Playbook and our rural infrastructure tour are a critical part of our extensive outreach to state, local, tribal and territorial governments to ensure the people of America can benefit from this once-in-a-generation investment,” said <strong>Mitch Landrieu, Senior Advisor &amp; Infrastructure Implementation Coordinator.</strong> “Building a better America requires these funds to reach rural communities that have been left behind for far too long.&nbsp; We see you, and major investments are on the way. With these investments in infrastructure in rural communities, President Biden is delivering for rural America.”</p>



<p>Across the month of April, the Biden-Harris administration will announce billions for rural areas including rural water projects, flood mitigation, transportation, healthcare, and tribal community grants, along with new technical assistance programs for rural and tribal communities.&nbsp; Earlier this month, the Department of the Interior <a href="https://doi.gov/pressreleases/interior-department-announces-420-million-rural-water-funding-president-bidens">announced $420 million for rural water systems</a> across six states: Iowa, Minnesota, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota and South Dakota. Today, the President is also announcing a $1 billion America the Beautiful Challenge that will leverage Federal conservation and restoration investments with private and philanthropic contributions to accelerate land, water, and wildlife conservation efforts across the country. The America the Beautiful Challenge is anchored by an initial commitment of $440 million of Federal resources over the next five years to a new public-private grant program, administered by the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation (NFWF), that will support locally led ecosystem restoration projects that invest in watershed restoration, resilience, equitable access, workforce development, corridors and connectivity, and collaborative conservation, consistent with the America the Beautiful Initiative. The America the Beautiful Challenge will offer states, Tribes, territories, local groups, non-governmental organizations, and others the opportunity to apply for multiple grant programs through a single application that is managed by NFWF.</p>



<p>Since President Biden signed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law nearly five months ago, the Biden-Harris Administration has hit the ground running to deliver results. The Administration has made key progress towards implementing the largest long-term investment in America’s infrastructure and competitiveness in nearly a century. More than $100 billion has been announced and allocated to states from formula and competitive programs for roads and highways, bridges, ports, airports, electric vehicle charging stations, water systems, high speed internet, weatherization and clean energy.</p>

<p>I have always believed that for America to succeed, rural America must succeed. Since taking office, my Administration has focused on building pathways to the middle class for rural Americans in rural America – including investing in rural infrastructure and rebuilding the communities that feed and fuel our country.</p>



<p>For far too long, opportunity has been out of reach for rural communities. My Administration is changing that. Through the American Rescue Plan, we supported rural families and provided rural communities with the tools and resources that made them central to America’s strong economic recovery. I also secured historic investments for rural America through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to make sure we revitalize and rebuild rural communities for years to come. These generational infrastructure investments will provide rural communities across America affordable high-speed internet, clean drinking water, reliable electricity, better roads and bridges, and good-paying jobs. Strong infrastructure in rural communities is good for jobs, good for keeping the economy moving, good for lowering prices, and good for America.</p>



<p>I am proud today that my Administration is launching a rural infrastructure tour to double down on our unwavering commitment to building a better America where rural communities thrive. In the coming weeks and beyond, Cabinet members and senior administration officials will crisscross the country to meet with, listen to, and deliver infrastructure investments to rural communities. As we unlock federal resources and generate results for these communities, we are unlocking opportunity – job opportunities, educational opportunities, and the opportunity for a better future.</p>
