<p class="has-text-align-center">Gordon&#8217;s Pond Trail<br>Lewes, Delaware</p>



<p>11:12 A.M. EDT</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Good morning, Mr. President.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Good morning!</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; I want you to know an important thing: I took off the clamps on my (inaudible).&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q &nbsp;&nbsp; How you feeling?</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; I’m feeling good.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Good.&nbsp; That’s great.</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; I’m looking for the sun though.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have you made a decision on tariffs, sir?&nbsp; I know you had a meeting about that on Friday.&nbsp;</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Oh, we’re having further discussions on that.&nbsp; And &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And do you have a &#8212; do you have a message, Mr. President, for women who were protesting outside the White House yesterday?</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Keep protesting.&nbsp; Because &#8212; keep making your point.&nbsp; It’s critically important.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We can do a lot of things to accommodate the rights of women in the meantime.&nbsp; But, fundamentally, the only thing that’s going to change this is if we have a national law that reinstates Roe v. Wade.&nbsp; That’s the bottom line.</p>



<p>Everything else, we can get pieces of it, and I’m trying to do that.&nbsp; Some things that some of the groups want &#8212;</p>



<p>I’m going to look like a fool here in this interview, but &#8212; (points to his bike helmet).&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You look good.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You look great.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT: &nbsp;I put a helmet on because this is a tough interview.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>But all kidding aside, I think that there’s things we can do to accommodate particular abuses beyond like not being able to cross state lines, those kinds of things, and being able to access women’s private information, and so on.&nbsp; That &#8212; we can work on that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But as President, I don’t have the authority to say that we’re going to, you know, instate Roe v. Wade as the law of the land.&nbsp; The only way we do that is through an election in the United States Congress.&nbsp; In the meantime, states can make those judgments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But &#8212; so my ultimate goal is to reinstate Roe v. Wade as the national law by passing it in the United States Congress.&nbsp; And I’ll sign it the moment that happens.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But I’m going to go on my ride.&nbsp; Okay?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, yes, Mr. President.&nbsp; One quick follow-up.&nbsp; One of the things they are asking for is a public health emergency.&nbsp; Is that something you’re considering?&nbsp; Or &#8212;</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; That’s something I’ve asked the folks to &#8212; the medical people in the administration to look at, whether that is &#8212; whether I have the authority to do that and what impact that would have.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Okay?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks so much.</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Thank you very much.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>McConnell is “Playing Politics with our National Security”</em></p>



<p>Speaking with George Stephanopoulos on ABC’s&nbsp;<em>This Week</em>, Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo pointed to legislation in Congress to build domestic manufacturing of semiconductor chips as a concrete step that needs to be taken to bring down prices for the American people. This legislation would create thousands of good-paying jobs and address the chips shortage that has driven prices higher on cars and countless other products. As the Secretary noted, Senator McConnell is now attempting to hold that legislation hostage to block another crucial effort to lower prices on prescription drugs for the American people.<br><br>The Secretary also noted that there are profound national security implications in not addressing the chips shortage, saying “He&#8217;s playing politics with our national security and it&#8217;s time for Congress to do its job on both of those dimensions.”<br><br><strong>Watch the clip:&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://twitter.com/abcpolitics/status/1546127074058031105?s=21&amp;t=S6SP7ACmRsV2YnOLwiulVQ">https://twitter.com/abcpolitics/status/1546127074058031105?s=21&amp;t=S6SP7ACmRsV2YnOLwiulVQ</a><br><br>STEPHANOPOULOS: …Is there anything more the President can do to combat inflation that he’s not doing now?</p>



<p>RAIMONDO: Well, one of the things that Ro Khanna&nbsp;pointed out in that piece is that Congress needs to pass the CHIPS Act. There’s a bill right now before Congress which Ro Khanna supports, President Biden supports, which would increase the domestic supply of semiconductors and also start a supply chain office in the Department of Commerce. That has to pass. Has to pass now. Not in six months from now, now. It&#8217;s bipartisan.</p>



<p>Mitch McConnell just threw a wrench in that about a week ago, saying that he wasn’t going to allow Republicans to move on that unless we move down reconciliation. That’s a perfect example, George, of increasing supply. We have inflation now because of lack of supply. And&nbsp;let&#8217;s increase supply.</p>



<p>STEPHANOPOULOS: But as you point out, Madam Secretary, Mitch McConnell said it&#8217;s not going anywhere as long as the President continues to push a budget reconciliation bill. So doesn&#8217;t that mean the CHIPS bill is dead?</p>



<p>RAIMONDO: It shouldn’t be dead. Why can’t we do both? What’s in that reconciliation bill? Allowing Medicare to negotiate for drug prices. What will that do? Bring down the prices of medicine for the average American consumer.</p>



<p>So the &#8212; again, the President wakes up every day pushing us and his team and Congress, what more can we do to bring down prices? So let&#8217;s bring down prescription drug prices, so that people feel that when they go to the drugstore and also let&#8217;s pass the CHIPS Act to bring down the prices of chips, which will bring down the price of pretty much everything you buy, because everything includes chips.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a false choice. He&#8217;s playing politics with our national security and it&#8217;s time for Congress to do its job on both of those dimensions.</p>

<p>Jill and I send our warmest greetings to Muslims across the United States and around the world celebrating Eid al-Adha. The Eid traditions and Hajj rituals that commemorate the devotion of Abraham and his son to God are an opportunity for Muslims to renew their faith, and a reminder of the common roots of the world’s great Abrahamic religions. And the act of sharing the sacrifice with those less fortunate in service of God mirrors our common commitment to work together to meet the challenges of our world today.<br><br>While COVID-19 restrictions remain, Muslims draped in white will be able to gather from around the world for the first time in two years to perform the Hajj. It’s a symbol of the progress we have made in fighting this pandemic and of all work we must still do to strengthen our recovery. Let us all take this opportunity to renew our shared commitment to work for peace, care for the vulnerable, and pursue greater equality and opportunity for all people.<br> <br>Here in the United States, Muslim Americans are leading on the frontlines, together with members of all faith communities, to assist those suffering from hunger and conflict, at home and abroad. To all those celebrating, Jill and I wish you and your loved ones a joyous holiday filled with community, celebration, compassion, and service. Eid Mubarak and Hajj Mabroor! </p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">George Bush Center for Intelligence<br>Langley, Virginia</p>



<p>3:57 P.M. EDT<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Thank you very much.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Thank you, thank you, thank you.&nbsp; It’s so good to be back.&nbsp; This is my third time standing before these stars to speak and &#8212; in my life in public &#8212; my time in public office.&nbsp; And &#8212; and it’s a great honor.<br><br>I was saying to some of the folks &#8212; and Avril has heard me say this before, along with Bill &#8212; that I’ve been involved with your agency for &#8212; not 75 years, but &#8212; (laughs) &#8212; but I hate to admit it, 52 years.&nbsp; (Makes the sign of the cross.)&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; I know it’s hard to say.<br><br>At any rate, but, you know, there was a time when there were questions raised about the agency in the so-called Church Committee way back in the early ‘70s.&nbsp; And that’s when they set up intelligence committees in the United States Senate &#8212; although I know you doubt that: intelligence in the Senate &#8212; but &#8212; (laughter) &#8212; I’m joking &#8212; and the House of Representatives.<br><br>And I was appointed to that committee by a great man &#8212; straight as an arrow &#8212; named Mike Mansfield, the senator from Montana.&nbsp; They called him “Iron Mike.”<br><br>And he &#8212; I think &#8212; I’m not positive, but I think the next-youngest person on the committee was, I think, 28 or 29 years older than I was.<br><br>So I’ve been doing &#8212; I’ve been watching from that day on and been deeply involved either as a member of the Intelligence Committee or the Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee or doing national security issues as Vice President and to today.&nbsp; And you’re an incredible group of people &#8212; incredible group of people.<br><br>Before I re- &#8212; move to my specific remarks I want to talk about today, I’d like to say just a very few words about the horrific, shocking killing of my friend, Japanese Prime Minister Abe.&nbsp;<br><br>I became acquainted with him when I was Vice President.&nbsp; I hosted him.&nbsp; He hosted me in Japan.&nbsp; And I just stopped by the Japanese Embassy to see the Ambassador and sign the <s>consolence</s> [condolence] book &#8212; the consol- &#8212; <s>consolence</s> [condolence] book for the Japanese people.&nbsp;<br><br>I knew him well.&nbsp; We worked together closely for years, and we spoke and consulted with one other when I served as Vice President.&nbsp;<br><br>And he &#8212; he was deeply committed to strengthening the alliance and friendship between the United States and Japan and pursuing an open and free Indo-Pacific region.&nbsp;<br><br>And service to his country and his people was in his bones.&nbsp; Even after he stepped down from public office, his focus on his health, he stayed engaged and he cared deeply.&nbsp; And I hold him in great respect.&nbsp;<br><br>This attack was &#8212; has had a profound impact on the psyche of the Japanese people.&nbsp; This is &#8212; this is a different &#8212; a different culture.&nbsp; They’re not used to &#8212; as, unfortunately, we are.&nbsp; Here in the United States, we know how deep the wounds of gun violence go for communities that are affected.&nbsp; And this assassination is a tragedy that all the people of Japan are feeling.&nbsp;<br><br>Today, I’m keeping his wife and family in my prayers.&nbsp; And the United States is standing in solidarity with our ally Japan with confidence in the strength of Japan’s democracy as they approach their elections on Sunday.&nbsp;<br><br>Director Burns, [Deputy] Director Cohen, I’m honored to be here, standing in front of this hallowed wall to honor 75 years of this proud institution and so many faithful public servants.&nbsp;<br><br>And Director Haines, thank you for being here today as well.&nbsp; For 75 years, our nation’s intelligence professionals have worked unceasingly and sacrificed willingly to make our country safer.&nbsp; And that’s not hyperbole.&nbsp; That’s a simple, straightforward fact.<br><br>And as we celebrate the history of this agency, we will never forget those who have laid down their lives in service to this nation.&nbsp; A hundred and thirty-nine stars behind me &#8212; two added just this year &#8212; each a patriot whose sacrifice we’re going to always honor and whose legacies live on in each of you as you continue their work.&nbsp;<br><br>You know, so often, you have to keep your identities secret, sometimes even in death, that we don’t get the chance to thank you enough for all that you do.&nbsp; You have to keep it secret, so many of you.&nbsp;<br><br>You ask for no recognition or personal acclaim, knowing that the quiet bravery of the women and men of this agency echoes loudly around the world &#8212; and I assure you it does, around the world &#8212; in lives saved, in crises averted, in truths revealed, in decisions of the 75 years of American presidents made better because of the insights you’ve provided.&nbsp; And again, that’s not exaggeration.<br><br>In the years between leaving office as Vice President and winning the nomination for President, the thing I missed most &#8212; and I mean this sincerely; I was a professor at the University of Pennsylvania &#8212; but I missed &#8212; you’re going to think I’m nuts, but I missed waking up every morning and getting &#8212; seeing the PDB.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;<br><br>No, seriously.&nbsp; Every single morning except from the time I was 26 years old &#8212; 27 years old &#8212; I mean 37 years old until I left the vice presidency &#8212; every morning, I got up and I knew what was happening around the world and in detail and, in many cases, in sharp relief.&nbsp;<br><br>It’s indispensable to me as I face some of the dec- &#8212; the difficult decisions to have the best possible information provided by the most capable, reliable intelligence community in the world.&nbsp; And again, not hyperbole, you are clearly the best in the whole world.&nbsp;<br><br>It was thanks to the incredible work of our intelligence professionals that we were able to forewarn the world what Vladimir Putin was planning in Ukraine.&nbsp; We saw what he was doing.&nbsp; You saw it &#8212; the forces he was amassing, the plans he was making.&nbsp;<br><br>Exposing Putin’s playbook punched a gigantic hole in the pretense and discredited his lies about what we were doing in Ukraine.<br><br>Without revealing sources and methods, that’s been critical to our ability to rally our Allies and partners around the world &#8212; again, not an exaggeration &#8212; to keep them united.<br><br>I imagine, General, you wondered whether we could.&nbsp; Many thought we &#8212; could we keep NATO alive?&nbsp; Could we keep it completely coherent and together?<br><br>And, by the way, I’ve spent well over 135 hours doing just that on almost a daily basis.&nbsp; Because Putin counted on &#8212; counted on the ability to break up NATO and to break our resolve.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>This organization changed dramatically since President Truman signed this into law &#8212; the National Security Act of 1947, which created the CIA.&nbsp; Wars have been fought, peace negotiated, new countries formed.&nbsp; Technology has empowered more people, but it also emboldened many to abuse that power that’s our wol- &#8212; our world smaller than it’s ever been.<br><br>And along the way, you’ve evolved to anticipate and respond to emerging threats from the earliest days of the Cold War to our fight against terrorism, to equipping ourselves for the competition ahead with China and meeting the transnational challenges that are reshaping the world, like emerging technologies, changing climate, and the spread of pandemics.&nbsp; You’re sort of the key to all of it.<br><br>Every step &#8212; every step, that 16-pointed compass star you walk across every morning when you come to work has guided your path.&nbsp; And a reminder of your ultimate mission: to bring together the intelligence and data from around the world so that those of us who direct American foreign policy can do everything in our power &#8212; everything in our power to keep the American people safe, because that’s what it’s all about.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>We turn to you with the big questions, the hardest questions.&nbsp; And we count on you to give your best, unvarnished assessment of where we are.&nbsp; And I emphasize “unvarnished.”&nbsp; That doesn’t mean I expect to always get it 100 percent right.&nbsp; But it does mean that I expect you to tell me the truth no matter what.&nbsp; No matter what.&nbsp;<br><br>I expect each of you to honor the democratic values and ideals that form the core of our nation’s strength.&nbsp;<br><br>We&#8217;re the most unique nation in the history of the world.&nbsp; That&#8217;s not hyperbole.&nbsp; We&#8217;re the only nation in the world based on an idea &#8212; not ethnicity, not geography, not religion.&nbsp; “We hold these truths to be self-evident…”&nbsp; We&#8217;ve never lived up to it, but we&#8217;ve never walked away from it.<br><br>And one of the ways to guarantee that doesn&#8217;t happen is the unvarnished truth.&nbsp;<br><br>Because, in this week when we celebrate our nation’s independence, we remember that America is strongest when we lead not just by the example of our power, but the power of our example.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why most nations follow us: the power of our example.&nbsp;<br><br>And, folks, although much of your work you do is going to remain unseen by necessity to protect you and your families and to safeguard the sources and methods, where possible we have to seek to balance secrecy with transparency, to shine a light on atrocities, and prevent plots or threats or acts of aggression before they happen.&nbsp; Because the greatest value of our intelligence collection is the good we do with it.<br><br>As we celebrate 75 years of this agency, I know you’re also honoring the trailblazers who helped make this institution what it is &#8212; the women and the men who changed the game or set the standard for intelligence profession.&nbsp;<br><br>You know, it’s an important reminder, just like these stars behind me &#8212; that’s what sets this agency apart &#8212; has always been &#8212; what sets you apart are the people.&nbsp; That’s what sets you apart.<br><br>And just like the work of every part of our government, our intelligence is more robust when we tap the full strength of our diversity as a nation.&nbsp;<br><br>When I first stood here, years ago, I looked out, there weren&#8217;t nearly as much diversity as there is today &#8212; women, people of color, men.&nbsp;<br><br>You know, that’s something “Wild Bill” Donovan knew when he created the Office of Strategic Services to collect intelligence to help us win World War Two.&nbsp;<br><br>And if diversity was essential to intelligence work in the ‘40s, its mission is critical today.&nbsp; If everyone brings the same ideas, the same experiences, the same skillsets to work, it will leave some pretty big blind spots in our security.<br><br>I also know that your work can be incredibly demanding.&nbsp; For the last 20 years, we’ve asked you to keep a relentless pace, serving in the face of physical dangers and daunting challenges.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>So let me just close by saying: Your health &#8212; your physical health and wellbeing are critically important to me and to your leadership here at the CIA.&nbsp; And as your President and your number-one consumer of your work, I have the greatest respect for you and for the sacrifices you and your families make for the country.&nbsp;&nbsp;Not just you.&nbsp;<br><br>There&#8217;s an expression &#8212; <s>Keats</s> [Milton] said, &#8220;They also serve who only stand and wait.&#8221;&nbsp; Think of your families, all the sacrifices they&#8217;ve made.&nbsp;<br><br>I know that you will continue to honor and uphold the highest traditions of the CIA and the highest values of this nation for the next 75 years and beyond.&nbsp; You will continue to serve as the bedrock of our national security as well as our national strength.&nbsp;<br><br>So, thank you for all that you do.&nbsp; May God protect you all and the work that keeps this nation safe from harm.&nbsp; And may God protect our troops.&nbsp; Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. (Applause.)<br><br>4:11 P.M. EDT</p>

<p>Today, July 8, 2022, Vice President Kamala Harris convened state legislative leaders from Indiana, Florida, South Dakota, Nebraska, and Montana who are fighting on the frontlines to protect reproductive rights. All five states have Republican-controlled state legislatures and Republican governors, and may soon call special sessions to pass abortion bans. The convening follows meetings about reproductive rights that the Vice President has held with health care providers, faith leaders, constitutional law and privacy experts, advocates, and Attorneys General.<br>&nbsp;<br>During the meeting, the Vice President discussed actions the Administration is taking to defend abortion rights, including the President’s signing of the Executive Order Protecting Access to Reproductive Health Care Services. The Vice President reiterated the Administration’s commitment to partnering with elected leaders at the local, state, and federal level to protect reproductive health care access.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The state legislative leaders shared what is happening in their states as extremist legislators are fighting to further limit reproductive health care access following the Supreme Court overruling <em>Roe v. Wade. </em>They discussed the importance of patient privacy and spoke out against government inference in decisions that should be made between a woman and her doctor. They also shared concerns about other rights that are being attacked on the state level, including voting rights and LGBTQI+ rights. The Vice President and the state leaders reaffirmed their commitment to working together to protect reproductive rights and freedoms for all women, no matter where they live.<br>&nbsp;<br>State legislative leaders included:</p>



<ul><li>Indiana House Minority Leader Representative Phil GiaQuinta</li><li>Florida incoming House Democratic Leader Representative Fentrice Driskell</li><li>South Dakota&nbsp;House Minority Whip Erin Healy</li><li>Nebraska Senator Patty Pansing Brooks</li><li>Montana Senator Diane Sands</li></ul>

<p>Two weeks ago, the Supreme Court issued a decision that overturned&nbsp;<em>Roe v. Wade&nbsp;</em>and eliminated a woman’s Constitutional right to choose.&nbsp; This decision expressly took away a right from the American people that it had recognized for nearly 50 years – a woman’s right to make her own reproductive health care decisions, free from government interference. Today, President Biden signed an Executive Order Protecting Access to Reproductive Health Care Services.<br><br>This Executive Order builds on the actions his Administration has already taken to defend reproductive rights by:</p>



<ul><li>Safeguarding access to reproductive health care services, including abortion and contraception;</li><li>Protecting the privacy of patients and their access to accurate information;</li><li>Promoting the safety and security of patients, providers, and clinics; and</li><li>Coordinating the implementation of Federal efforts to protect reproductive rights and access to health care.</li></ul>



<p><em>See below for what they are saying:</em><br><br><strong><em><u>Elected Officials</u></em></strong><br><br><strong><em>Members of Congress &#8211; Senators</em></strong><br><br><strong>Sen. Debbie Stabenow: </strong>“Thank you @POTUS for using your executive powers to do everything you can to protect our freedom to make our own reproductive health decisions. Ultimately, protecting our freedom will be decided at the ballot box. Until then, we need to do everything we can to limit the harm the Supreme Court decision is causing for women and families across our country. This Executive Order will: &#8211; Safeguard access to reproductive health care &#8211; Protect patient privacy &amp; access to accurate information &#8211; Promote patients, providers, &amp; clinics safety &amp; security &#8211; Coordinate Federal efforts to protect reproductive rights &amp; access to health care” [<a href="https://twitter.com/SenStabenow/status/1545450223685828609">Tweet</a>, 7.8.22]<br><br><strong>Sen. Patty Murray: </strong>“After leading the charge in urging @POTUS to act boldly to protect abortion access, I&#8217;m glad to see him take further action today even with limited executive authority. These steps are good &amp; important, but the post-Roe health care crisis is urgent. This fight is far from over.” [<a href="https://twitter.com/PattyMurray/status/1545444536163368960">Tweet</a>, 7.8.22]<br><br><strong>Sen. Tom Carper: </strong>“In the wake of a disastrous SCOTUS decision, we need an all-of-government approach to protect women’s access to reproductive health care. @POTUS’s action will help women get the care they need. But we in Congress need to do more—far more—to protect this constitutional right.” [<a href="https://twitter.com/SenatorCarper/status/1545501000978649089">Tweet</a>, 7.8.22]<br><br><strong>Sen. Chris Coons:</strong> “Glad to see decisive action from @POTUS to protect access to reproductive health care. The American people have a right to privacy and bodily autonomy, and these steps will help safeguard women’s health from gov&#8217;t overreach. The fight continues to protect the right to choose.” [<a href="https://twitter.com/ChrisCoons/status/1545443195286323200">Tweet</a>, 7.8.22]<br><br><strong>Sen. Elizabeth Warren: </strong>“@POTUS&#8217; executive order will help Americans receive the reproductive health care they need. I urged the Biden administration to expand access to medication abortion, protect patient privacy, and safeguard interstate travel for care. Today&#8217;s actions are important first steps. The Administration should continue to explore every available option to protect access to abortion care. The overwhelming majority of Americans oppose this extremist Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, and we must use every tool possible to address this emergency.” [<a href="https://twitter.com/SenWarren/status/1545448006946029574">Tweet</a>, 7.8.22]<br><br><strong>Sen. Cortez Masto:</strong> “Today, @POTUS heeded my call to take executive action to safeguard access to reproductive care and protect women’s data privacy. While these steps are important, more needs to be done to protect reproductive freedom, and I’ll keep fighting for women and their families.” [<a href="https://twitter.com/SenCortezMasto/status/1545415758192054272">Tweet</a>, 7.8.22]<br><br><strong>Sen.

Tammy Baldwin</strong>: “The Executive Order from @POTUS takes positive and important steps to protect access to reproductive health care services. Now, we all need to keep pushing forward to take back the rights and freedoms Republicans have taken away from women.” [<a href="https://twitter.com/SenatorBaldwin/status/1545461075470082049">Tweet</a>, 7.8.22]<br><br><strong>Sen. Tammy Duckworth: </strong>“Since the Supreme Court cruelly overturned Roe, people across the country have been crying out for action. I’m glad @POTUS answered my call for an EO and took this first step to reaffirm the right to choose for every American. Now it’s time Congress acts to codify this right.” [<a href="https://twitter.com/SenDuckworth/status/1545473050099032064">Tweet</a>, 7.8.22]<br><br><strong>Sen. Diane Feinstein: </strong>“I&#8217;m glad President Biden has heeded the call of Senate Democrats to issue an executive order to help protect access to abortion.

Maggie Hassan: </strong>“By overturning Roe, the Supreme Court took away a woman’s autonomy and ability to make her own health care decisions. The administration’s actions announced today are welcome steps to mitigate the impact of this decision. We also know that in the aftermath of the decision, Mitch McConnell and anti-choice extremists’ ultimate objective is to ban abortion nationwide — we must hold the line against this and keep fighting to protect a woman’s fundamental freedom.” [<a href="https://www.hassan.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senator-hassan-statement-on-administrations-executive-order-following-the-supreme-courts-roe-decision">Statement</a>, 7.8.22]<br><br><strong>Sen.

But the Senate still needs to take action to codify Roe into law. And that means abolishing the filibuster. We have to act now.” [<a href="https://twitter.com/SenatorLujan/status/1545471811441369088">Tweet</a>, 7.8.22]<br><br><strong>Sen. Ed Markey: </strong>“.@POTUS&#8217;s actions, including directing the FTC to safeguard the privacy of individuals seeking an abortion, are an important step in the fight to protect essential abortion rights. Now, Congress must go further to abolish the filibuster and codify Roe.” [<a href="https://twitter.com/SenMarkey/status/1545464010719563785">Tweet</a>, 7.8.22]<br><br><strong>Sen.

Gary Peters: </strong>“This is welcome action from @POTUS – but there’s no question the fight to protect critical health care for women is far from over. It’s clear Republicans want to impose further bans to abortion access and more cruel restrictions at every level of government—even in cases of rape, incest and when the life of the mother is at risk. Congress must step up – and I will always fight in the Senate to ensure access to vital health care and to keep the government from interfering in a woman’s right to make health care decisions with her doctor.” [<a href="https://twitter.com/SenGaryPeters/status/1545458472036274176">Tweet</a>, 7.8.22]<br><br><strong>Sen. Jacky Rosen: </strong>“In the wake of Roe v. Wade being overturned, a group of my colleagues and I urged @POTUS to take action to protect a woman&#8217;s right to choose. Today&#8217;s Executive Order is welcome news, and we will keep pushing for action in every way we can to protect reproductive rights.” [<a href="https://twitter.com/SenJackyRosen/status/1545460431686455300">Tweet</a>, 7.8.22]<br><br><strong>Sen. Jeanne Shaheen:</strong> “These are important steps to help preserve access to abortion &amp; repro services in the wake of the devastating Roe reversal. Decisions around health &amp; bodily autonomy belong to patients – not jurists or politicians. I’ll keep fighting to secure access to life-saving health care.” [<a href="https://twitter.com/SenatorShaheen/status/1545457683360370690?s=20&amp;t=sduMHttlkjVMC2AKgtoHmA">Tweet</a>, 7/8/2022]<br><br><strong>Sen.

Wade into federal law.&nbsp; We will also pass legislation addressing the GOP’s disturbing threats to restrict Americans’ freedom to travel — reaffirming the Constitutional right to seek care freely and voluntarily throughout the country. “We have a sacred, fundamental duty to expand freedom in America, not to roll back fundamental rights.&nbsp; While Republicans seek to criminalize reproductive health care nationwide, House Democrats will never relent in our fight to defend freedom for women and for every American.” [<a href="https://www.speaker.gov/newsroom/7822-1">Statement</a>, 7.8.22]<br><br><strong>House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer</strong>: “Today’s executive order shows that the American people have a President who takes swift action to protect women’s reproductive choice.&nbsp; While this executive order is important and will help women access reproductive health care where they need it and maintain privacy, in truth there is very little that the President can do on his own to address the dangers posed by the Supreme Court’s ruling in&nbsp;<em>Dobbs v. Jackson</em>.&nbsp; It is up to Congress to take meaningful action by enacting laws that guarantee reproductive freedom in all states and territories of our union.&nbsp; That’s what the House did when we passed the Women’s Health Protection Act last year &#8211; and we will do so again next week with an updated version of that bill. I will also bring to the House Floor next week the Ensuring Access to Abortion Act, to make it possible and safe for women needing abortion care to travel to states where it is accessible.&nbsp; I urge the Senate to act without delay and join the House in taking action to protect women’s reproductive choice in the wake of the extremist and precedent-ignoring&nbsp;<em>Dobbs v. Jackson</em>&nbsp;ruling.” [<a href="https://www.majorityleader.gov/content/hoyer-statement-president-bidens-executive-order-protecting-reproductive-freedom#:~:text=Hoyer%20(MD)%20released%20the%20following,to%20protect%20women's%20reproductive%20choice.">Statement</a>, 7.8.22]<br><br><strong>Rep.

The President directed @SecBecerra to protect access to medication abortion, ensure emergency medical care, protect access to contraception, and unite lawyers across the country to defend the rights of people seeking reproductive health care in areas that have banned abortion. The Executive Order will also protect consumer privacy, personal data, and sensitive health information and importantly will advance the safety of providers and clinics who are courageously providing essential reproductive health care services in the face of heightened risk. These actions are a step in the right direction, but they are not enough on their own. We must codify Roe v.

<p>The Executive Order addresses the need to protect digital health privacy so that sensitive individual health information is not sold to data brokers. AMWA supports all efforts aimed at protecting personal medical privacy as a cornerstone of the invaluable physician-patient relationship.&nbsp;As with most medical decisions, reproductive health matters, including abortion, are complex and nuanced, necessitating considerations by the patient in consultation with their physician without legislative interference.&nbsp;AMWA supports efforts to provide better protective measures that assure physicians are able to practice evidence-based medicine and deliver the most appropriate and necessary care possible. AMWA commends the efforts announced today by the White House as important steps toward securing physicians’ ability to deliver reproductive-related care without fear of legal repercussions. And, to support patients’ rights to receive desired and necessary reproductive medical care.&nbsp;AMWA champions these measures that uphold our mission to assure that quality healthcare, including abortion, is accessible and available to all.” [<a href="https://www.amwa-doc.org/news/amwa-endorses-presidents-order-reproductive-rights/">Statement</a>, 7.8.22]</p>

As some states work to criminalize abortion, it is essential that our federal government protect those rights, which is consistent with what the Christian faith, the Bible and the teachings of many faith traditions support. The Bible never explicitly discusses abortion. What it does consistently tell us is that human beings are moral agents, fully capable of making their own decisions. It also tells us that we should protect and love each other. And so Union thanks the Biden administration for advancing the very Christian value of protecting and loving each other.

<p>We, the leaders of Australia, India, and the United States, are shocked at the tragic assassination of former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Prime Minister Abe was a transformative leader for Japan and for Japanese relations with each one of our countries. He also played a formative role in the founding of the Quad partnership, and worked tirelessly to advance a shared vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific. Our hearts are with the people of Japan — and Prime Minister Kishida— in this moment of grief. We will honor Prime Minister Abe’s memory by redoubling our work towards a peaceful and prosperous region.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Vice President&#8217;s Ceremonial Office<br><em>Eisenhower Executive Office Building</em></em></p>



<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, good afternoon.  I want to welcome and thank these extraordinary leaders, who are based in various states but who are also national leaders, for coming together so we could have this conversation about, I think, one of the most challenging and troubling issues of the day.<br> <br>Last month, as we all know &#8212; actually, just weeks ago, the Supreme Court of the United States did something that is &#8212; before then was unthinkable and unprecedented, which is the United States Supreme Court took a constitutional right that had previously been recognized &#8212; took it from the women of America and with great consequence, as we know. <br> <br>This is not a law school debate.  This is not an intellectual discussion and debate.  This is real in the way that it is currently and will impact the women and the girls of America in a very direct way. <br> <br>It goes without saying that I think we share a belief that women should be able to make decisions about their own bodies without interference from their government; that she should be able to make a decision about whether or not to have an abortion in the privacy of a safe place where she will make that decision &#8212; be it with her pastor, her priest, her rabbi, her family, a physician &#8212; but not requiring permission from her government.<br> <br>So, this is about that.  This is also, for so many reasons that are integral to what is at stake, a healthcare crisis in America, I would offer.<br> <br>We have heard recent examples of what this means for a girl as young as 10 years old, who endured an act of violence &#8212; I say as a former prosecutor who specialized in child sexual assault &#8212; and who then has to endure a system that clearly is not in its current design with these laws in place, designed in a way that is about keeping her in mind in terms of what will give her a safe place in a way that she can address and those around her who care about her can address her needs.<br> <br>When we look at this issue, we know that it affects our country at every level, in each and every region.  We also know that the federal government and we, our administration, recognizes the power and the importance and the responsibility we have to partner with elected leaders in local, state, and at the federal level.  And so that&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve asked you all to come and join us today, so we can have a conversation about what&#8217;s happening in your states.<br> <br>I do want to emphasize though, back to the point of the 10-year-old girl that we&#8217;ve been hearing so much about: We have, I believe, 12 states in our country that, right now, will not even allow an exception in their ban on abortion &#8212; will not even allow an exception for rape or incest.<br> <br>We have in our country states that are criminalizing healthcare professionals for doing what they believe is in the best interest, in the public health interest of their community.<br> <br>And so, again, we take these issues quite seriously, understanding the ramifications and the injustice that is playing out associated with this issue.<br> <br>So, I also believe that this is just the beginning.  When we &#8212; most of us have read the opinion and the concurring opinion.  As I&#8217;ve said before, Justice Thomas said the quiet part out loud, which is that also at risk is the right for individuals to make the most intimate decisions that they can make about what I call &#8220;heart and home&#8221; when it comes to issues like contraception, same-sex marriage.<br> <br>And so, there is a lot at stake.  We cannot wait for Congress to act.  Congress must act.  But also, we cannot wait for Congress to act, which is why the President, Joe Biden, this morning, earlier today issued executive orders around what we will do at the federal level to ensure that women are not impeded in terms of their right to interstate travel and also that they will have access to the medication that they need, which, by the way, the FDA approved, I believe, over 20 years ago.<br> <br>So, with that, there&#8217;s a lot at stake.  We are working together.  We will continue to work together.<br> <br>And, with that, I&#8217;m going to invite a discussion for the leaders around the table.  And I&#8217;ll start to my left with Representative GiaQuinta from the great state of Indiana.<br> <br>                        END                4:07 P.M. EDT</p>
