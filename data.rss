<p class="has-text-align-center">McCormick Place Convention Center<br>Chicago, Illinois</p>



<p>4:10 P.M. CDT<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:  Hell, hello, hello!  (Applause.)  Thank you, thank you, thank you.  I want to start off by saying two things.  Number one, the only reason I&#8217;m standing here as your President of the United States of America is because of the IBEW came on with me early.  (Applause.)<br><br>And secondly, is Delaware in the house?  Anybody from Delaware? <br><br>AUDIENCE MEMBER:  (Inaudible.)<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:  Holler loudly, man, because I want to see you after this is over.<br><br>Folks, please sit down.  Please sit down. <br><br>Well, Lonnie, I want to thank you.  You’re a de- &#8212; a dear friend and one of the great leaders of labor of our time.  I mean that.  You’ve been there every time.<br><br>And I also want to thank the IBEW’s Kenneth Cooper, Chris Erickson, Paul Nobel.<br><br>And as I said early on, the IBEW was with me when I was a kid running for the Senate in Delaware.  And some of them are back there somewhere.<br><br>And I’m also proud of our Secretary of Labor &#8212; a card-carrying union member &#8212; Marty Walsh &#8212; fighting for union and worker power every day.  (Applause.)  <br><br>But, Lonnie, I only have one problem: Sometimes I can&#8217;t understand him.  He talks about <em>cars</em> and <em>car barns &#8212; </em>(said in Boston accent) &#8212; and all that kind of thing.  I wonder what he&#8217;s talking about sometimes.  But he&#8217;s the best, man.  If you got to be in a foxhole, you want him with you.<br><br>And, folks, there&#8217;s an expression where I come from: “You go home with them that brung you to the dance.”  You all brought me to the dance, and I mean it.  <br><br>I said early on that I was going to be the most pro-labor, -union President we&#8217;ve ever had for a simple reason: You allow &#8212; (applause) &#8212; you allow workers to maintain their dignity.  You allow them to hold their heads up high.  I mean it.  It’s a lot more than just what you do in terms of their paychecks and their benefits, but it’s about their dignity. <br><br>My dad used to have an expression.  He said, “Joey, a job is a lot more than a paycheck.  It’s about your dignity.  It’s about your place in the community.  It’s about…”  And I swear to God it’s what he&#8217;d say.  “It’s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, ‘Honey, everything is going to be okay.’” <br><br>Well, the union movement in the United States of America is the primary reason why that happened &#8212; the primary reason why that happened.  <br><br>And, folks, look, there&#8217;s so much &#8212; we&#8217;ve done a lot, but there&#8217;s so much more to do.<br><br>So I &#8212; basic thing is, first of all: Thank you, thank you, thank you for your support.  Thank you.  (Applause.)<br><br>You&#8217;re the reason I&#8217;m standing here today as President.  I’ve never forgotten not only what you’ve done for me, but what you’ve done for America.  I’ve said this before, I&#8217;ll repeat it again &#8212; when I spoke to you a couple &#8212; about a year ago: You literally built this country.<br><br>If every investment banker in America would go on strike, not a whole hell of a lot would happen.  But guess what?  If you all went on strike nationwide, the country would shut down &#8212; shut down.  (Applause.)<br><br>You’ve heard it a thousand times when I was running for office &#8212; a thousand times: The middle class built this country.  Your plan was to build this economy around you, from the middle up and the bottom down &#8212; the bottom up. <br><br>I&#8217;m so sick and tired of trickle-down economics that only trickles to a few people.  <br><br>When the middle class does well, the poor have a way up and the wealthy do just fine.<br><br>As I&#8217;ve said, Wall Street didn’t build this country, the middle class did.  And unions built the middle class, not labor.  Unions built the middle class.  (Applause.)  That’s a tr- &#8212; it’s a fact.  That’s a fact.<br><br>With your help, we’re seeing the strongest job creation in modern times.<br><br>We inherited an economy on the brink of a great depression &#8212; millions of people losing their jobs, losing their homes, but even more importantly, losing hope.<br><br>But look at the economy today: 8.3 million jobs in my first 15 months in office &#8212; a record.  (Applause.)<br><br>The unemployment rate now stands at 3.6 percent, the fastest decline &#8212; the fastest decline in unemployment at the start of any President’s term on record.<br><br>Jobs and companies are coming home again.  We’re making “Buy America” a reality, not just a slogan.  (Applause.)<br><br>Look, folks, our economy has gone from being on the mend to being on the move.  You know, it started with my American Rescue Plan.  Because of it, we had the best year of state and local job growth in 20 years.  We gave governors &#8212; great governors like the one in this state &#8212; we gave them a whole lot of money.  We added back 460,000 jobs &#8212; critical state and local workers, educators, firefighters, police officers.  This includes a record 279,000 education jobs in 2021, because they didn’t have the tax base to be able to hire them. <br><br>The American Rescue Plan provided eviction relief, funding for states and cities to allocate to landlords and renters &#8212; help them keep a roof over the heads &#8212; 5 million households.<br><br>Remember those long lines you’d see on the television and people lining up in all kinds of vehicles just to get a box of food in their trunk?  How quickly we forget people were hurting.  <br><br>And what did the MAGA crowd want to do?  Forget it.  Forget it. <br><br>God, this is the United States of America.  The idea that people would have to wait in line an hour or hour and a half to get a box of food in their trunk &#8212; it’s just unbelievable.<br><br>You know, the American Rescue Plan helped 41 million people put food on the table &#8212; 41 million; the money in the pockets of hardworking Americans who, through no fault of their own, were in trouble, giving families what my dad called “just a little bit of breathing room.” <br><br>And now, not only has “Infrastructure Week” finally arrived after four years of the other guy, we can look forward to the infrastructure decade for 10 years.  (Applause.)  It’s a fact.  <br><br>I know you’re all over the country.  (Applause.)  And the projects are coming to you.  It’s not just for a year; it’s for the next decade &#8212; 10 years.  (Applause.)  <br><br>Here in Illinois alone there are over 6,000 miles of highway, 2,300 bridges in poor condition.<br><br>This year alone, Illinois will receive 1 billion 900 million dollars in highway funding for roads and bridges and $297 million dedicated &#8212; dedicated to funding for bridges that are in disrepair.<br><br>You know, I was going to Pittsburgh a couple of months ago, early &#8212;<br><br>AUDIENCE MEMBER:  Woo!<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah, I like Pittsburgh, man.  But I was going to Pittsburgh a couple months ago to speak.  And as I got there, a bridge going over a culvert about &#8212; looked like about 200 yards long and about, at the top, probably 120 feet from the little creek below &#8212; totally collapsed.  Totally collapsed. <br><br>Thank God one of the only things that the COVID crisis did was their kids weren’t in school; otherwise there’d be hundreds of kids in school buses going across there at the time.  <br><br>This is the United States of America.  The idea we have bridges that are collapsing, or about to collapse &#8212; I really mean it &#8212; it just drives me crazy to think about it.  <br><br>And, folks, look, Mayor Lightfoot talked about how Chicago has lead service pipes &#8212; more lead service pipes in drinking water than any other city in America, affecting nearly 400,000 Chicago homes.<br><br>And guess what?  That lead causes brain damage, particularly to kids, in those pipes.  The law is going to fix that, because every American deserves to be able to turn on a spigot and drink clean water.  Nationwide, 10 million homes.<br><br>Because of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, we’ve announced nearly $3 billion to modernize more than <s>300</s> [3,000] airports across all 50 states &#8212; just like this year.    <br><br>Chicago airports are going to receive &#8212; just this year &#8212; nearly $100 million that can be used to improve runways, taxiways, and terminals.<br><br>You know, some of you may remember, if you’re from New York City, when I was Vice President, I landed there to meet with a group of &#8212; to go in and speak to a union convention.  I came back out to LaGuardia.  And when I was in there, I said &#8212; and I walked into the terminal and there was a sign &#8212; one of the escalators wasn’t working.  It’s the God’s truth.  I looked up the escalator.  It said, “Will be fixed in one month.” <br><br>One of the finest cities in all of America and you have a sign saying it’s going to take a month to fix an escalator. <br><br>So, I made a comment about that at the &#8212; at the union I spoke to and the group I spoke with.  And it made instant news: “Biden was criticizing…”<br><br>Here’s what I said: I said, “If I took you to an airp- &#8212; blindfolded you, put you in an airport in Beijing and one in New York and I said to you, ‘Where are you: Beijing or New York?’” &#8212; you would’ve thought the Beijing airport was the American airport with no one in it.  Not a joke. <br><br>And guess what?  As I went back to get on Air Force Two, I’m standing there and I get off &#8212; I get out of the vehicle and I’m on the runway, and there’s nine guys and two women with their yellow, you know, bibs on and everything, who worked at the airport.  I thought, “Oh, God.  I’m not going to get up on the train &#8212; up on the plane.” <br><br>Do you know what they said?  “Thank you.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.”  And guess what?  They ended up investing almost a billion dollars in the airport, and it works.  (Applause.)  <br><br>This is the United States of America!  (Applause.)  We used to have the finest infrastructure in the world.  We were rated number one in the world; we’re now rated number 14.  The United States of America.  Why?  I would argue it’s because of the greed of the folks at the top not wanting to get things done. <br><br>But, folks, look, we’ve announced $5 billion, including $615 <s>billion</s> [million] this year alone so the IBEW can get to work building a national network of 500,000 charging stations all across America.  (Applause.)<br><br>And guess what?  This guy here is part of the reason.  Not a joke.  (Applause.) <br><br>He won&#8217;t rem- &#8212; he won&#8217;t remember this, but I met with all the heads of &#8212; the CEOs of the major car companies.  And you may remember General Motors back then, when I first got elected, was suing California because they said they had a higher standard for emissions than other states, and they couldn’t have a na- &#8212; a local standard higher than a federal standard. <br><br>And so, I talked to Mary Barra.  And about two weeks later, she called me and said, “We’re dropping our suit.  We’re dropping our suit.”  And I listened, and she said, “We’re going to go all electric by 2035.”  Guess what?  Five hundred thousand charging stations are going to have to be built as we build these things.  (Applause.)  <br><br>And I think this guy is partially to blame.  (Applause.) <br><br>Look, more than $20 billion so IBEW workers can modernize our electric grid, building larger and more resilient transmission lines that can withstand storms and get new and clean energy to our homes. <br><br>Think about it, folks: Who the hell but you crazy guys climb up poles in the middle of a storm to try to replace a generator?  (Applause.)  No, I’m serious.  I’m genuinely serious.  People don’t get &#8212; we have to let people know more of what you actually do.    <br><br>We’re investing $65 billion so that highly skilled and certified IBEW wor- &#8212; members can deliver affordable high-speed &#8212; high-speed Internet everywhere &#8212; rural, urban, suburban.  (Applause.)  <br><br>Just this week, I announced that 40 million low-income Americans from families of four earning less than $55,000 a year will get high-speed Internet installed in their homes for free.  Free!  Free!  (Applause.)<br><br>And we worked it out with the Internet companies.  Nearly 40 percent of households in America will qualify.<br><br>We can’t be a country where a mother has to drive up to a McDonald’s parking lot in the evening with her child just so he can get on the Internet to do his homework.  <br><br>Again, this is the United States of America, for God’s sake. <br><br>And what this means to all of you is good-paying union jobs.  Jobs you can raise a family on.  Jobs that can’t be outsourced.<br><br>This law is about more than rebuilding infrastructure.  It’s also how about rebuilding the middle class. <br><br>As I said, unions built the middle class.  And that’s why we made sure that the Infrastructure Law included significant labor protections.  (Applause.) <br><br>For example, the overwhelming majority of the funds included in the law are subject to Davis-Bacon requirements, so folks rebuilding our country can earn a prevailing wage.  (Applause.) <br><br>Look, it’s why we’re strongly encouraging grantees who get infrastructure funding to use project labor agreements to ensure that workers building the major projects are well-trained, highly-skilled, and have a voice on the work site.<br><br>That’s why I continue to call on Congress to fully and finally pass the PRO Act, which makes &#8212; (applause) &#8212; which makes it easier for workers to organize a union.  (Applause.) <br><br>You know, I’m not just saying this to be pro-union.  I’m saying this because I’m pro-America. <br><br>Look, when Congress passed the National Labor Relations Act in 1935, it didn’t just say that we should “allow” unions.  Everybody forgot this for a long time.  What it said is: We, the federal government, should “encourage” unions and collective bargaining.  That’s what it said.  (Applause.)  There’s a reason for that.  <br><br>Let’s be clear for our Republican friends: You can’t say you’re working &#8212; you’re for working people and vote against the PRO Act.  It’s not consistent.  <br><br>Look, you all know why this matters.  Union members get higher wages, better benefits and health insurance, paid leave; protections against discrimination and harassment; and safer and healthier workplaces.<br><br>But there’s another reason: Workers join unions to gain power.  That’s what it’s about.  The only way to match power is with power.  It’s the only way it can be done.  You can’t count on the good graces of major corporations to decide they’re going to help.  Power is needed to be exerted to deal with power.  Power over the decisions that affect your lives. <br><br>Unions provide, in one word, democracy.<br><br>Rebuilding America with union labor is also smart for business.  (Applause.)  This is the point I make &#8212; and, by the way, I’m not getting many arguments from CEOs.  It’s smart for business.  Why?  When union workers are on the job, projects are completed efficiently and professionally, and they ultimately save money.<br><br>For folks at home, maybe you’re not in a union or know anyone who is in a union, but know this: It’s hard work.  You got to earn it.  <br><br>Ask a journeyman electricians, anyone &#8212; a journeymen electricians here today &#8212; (applause) &#8212; no, I’m serious.  Think about this.  And you guys got to talk &#8212; with all due respect, you got to talk more about this.<br><br>The fact is: It takes four to five years as an apprentice &#8212; 8,000 hours of training.  Now, granted, you get paid while you&#8217;re doing it.  <br><br>But the power goes out in a storm &#8212; why do you think &#8212; who climbs up that pole while the snow and the rain are still coming down?  Union workers.  They&#8217;re the best workers in the world.  You&#8217;re the most qua- &#8212; this is not &#8212; again, I&#8217;m not trying to be nice to you all.  No, I really &#8212; I mean this sincerely.<br><br>Why, if you have the capacity, would you not hire a union worker, whatever the job is &#8212; not just IBEW, a union worker &#8212; to do the job?  (Applause.)  Seriously.<br><br>We all talk about &#8212; you go to college for four years.  Well, guess what?  When you got to be an apprentice and it takes up to five years to get your apprenti- &#8212; to go through the program, you&#8217;re getting a hell of an edu- &#8212; you&#8217;re working like hell.  That&#8217;s why you&#8217;re the most qualified people in the world &#8212; not just here, in the world.<br><br>And we&#8217;re beginning to see the effects of unions and the impact on everything from what you see going on in Ukraine right now.  Our stuff isn&#8217;t falling apart.  (Laughs.)  Theirs is.  (Laughter and applause.)  Theirs is.  No, I&#8217;m serious.  (Applause.)<br><br>So, folks, their quality of work is good for the American taxpayer.  We&#8217;re not costing the American taxpayers money.  We&#8217;re saving them money.  (Applause.)  No, no &#8212; I &#8212; I &#8212; you guys don&#8217;t say this enough, quite frankly.  Excu- &#8212; if you don&#8217;t mind my saying so.  All in the family here.  You don&#8217;t say it enough.<br><br>It’s good for families in every neighborhood where infrastructure projects are underway.<br><br>Look, but here’s the deal: Building an economy from the bottom up and middle out doesn’t happen by itself.<br><br>For example, I know folks are concerned about inflation.  I come from a family &#8212; and I mean this sincerely &#8212; like most of you, where if the price of gasoline went up significantly and the price of food went up, that&#8217;s what we talked about at the dinner table and the kitchen table.  It meant a lot.  We felt it.  We felt it.  I understand.<br><br>That’s why I’ve got a plan to lower the costs for everyday things that make most people &#8212; who work to have, who need it.  And that would fundamentally change the standard of living if we just made things more affordable. <br><br>There&#8217;s more than one way to deal with the impact on a family than what we&#8217;re doing.  And we&#8217;re going to beat inflation.  But beyond that, it&#8217;s all about the quality of life.<br><br>You know, I remember my dad used to say &#8212; if he had an opportunity &#8212; my dad, I guess, made &#8212; back in the late &#8217;60s, he probably made the equivalent of $20,000 a year.  It wasn&#8217;t a bad salary, but it wasn&#8217;t great.  He had four kids.<br><br>And if someone came along and said to my dad, &#8220;I can guarantee that your salary is going to go up 500 bucks a year every year for the next 10 years, or we can make sure your kid can go to college with a lot cheaper than it costs now.  I can make sure your cost of electricity and energy in your home is down, not up.  I can make sure that you&#8217;re going to be in a position where you&#8217;re going to have &#8212; the roads in front of the house are going to be paved.  What do you ask for?&#8221;<br><br>My dad would say, &#8220;All the rest relates to my standard of living.&#8221;  That&#8217;s what middle-class folks are concerned about.  And not being embarrassed in front of their kids when they can&#8217;t do something that they know they should be able to do for them.<br><br>I really mean it.  Again, it gets back to a word that&#8217;s probably overused in my house.  As my grandfather would say, &#8220;Maybe it&#8217;s the Irish of it.&#8221;  The word &#8220;dignity.&#8221;  The simple dignity.<br><br>And so, there are so many things we can do that don&#8217;t do anything other than make the country better and don&#8217;t cost the taxpayers more money if we just decide to be fair and everybody would begin to pay their fair share.<br><br>Look, folks, you know, an example of my plan would be to let Medicare negotiate the price of prescription drugs like the Department of Veterans Affairs does.  <br><br>We say to the &#8212; the companies that are &#8212; the drug companies, &#8220;We&#8217;re only going to pay X number of dollars for the following thing.  If you don&#8217;t want to do that, we&#8217;re not going to buy any of your drugs.&#8221;  Well, since you got thousands of people and when you&#8217;re talking millions of people, they say, &#8220;Okay.&#8221;<br><br>But here&#8217;s the deal, going back to this idea &#8212; just making sure we have basic dignity.<br><br>You know, putting a cap on the price of insulin &#8212; many of you have children &#8212; or maybe some of you have Type 2 diabetes.  People with Type 2 diabetes need their insulin shots.  Need them.  It&#8217;s not like an option &#8212; not like an option.<br><br>Well, guess what?  It costs the drug companies 10 bucks &#8212; you hear me?  &#8212; $10 to make that insulin and &#8212; counting in all the research and development they did to get to that point.<br><br>Yet, you know what the average cost of insulin for a month for a Type 2 diabetic is?  And there&#8217;s 200,000 kids out there who have Type <s>2</s> [1] diabetes.  They &#8212; the average cost is $640 a month.<br><br>Now, what the hell do you do, as a mom or a dad, if you don&#8217;t have private insurance and you don&#8217;t have coverage?<br><br>Not only do you look at your child &#8212; I mean this sincerely and from the bottom of my heart.  You look at your child, and not only do you worry about where they&#8217;re going to live &#8212; because you got to divide up what little you have and maybe stretch it out.  What do you think it does to you as a parent, looking at your child?  Talk about being deprived of your personal dignity.<br><br>What the hell are we doing?  Why?  Think of the difference that it would make for millions of Americans struggling every single month to afford insulin for their child.  <br><br>Take childcare: In a city like this or any major cities in America, it costs about $14,000 a year per child who’s not at school age.  <br><br>I remember.  I was 29 years old.  You guys helped to get me elected to the United States Senate.  I wasn’t old enough to be sworn in.  <br><br>I was down in Washington, interviewing staff before I was sworn in.  And I got a phone call from the first responders in my state.  They said, “You got to come home.  There&#8217;s been an accident.”  I said, “What happened?”  They said, “Well, a tractor trailer broadsided your wife&#8217;s car with your three kids while they were Christmas shopping.”  And the poor young woman they put on the phone to tell me said, “And your wife is dead.  Your daughter is dead.  And your boys are really hurt.”<br><br>So, I went home, obviously.  And I didn’t want to stay in the Senate.  I wanted no part of it.  But because of some really fine men &#8212; one Republican and five Democrats &#8212; they convinced me that, “Well, Joe, just come and stay six months.  Help us organize.”  See how smart I was?  We had elected 58 Democrats and a Democratic governor in my state that would have appointed a Democrat.  So, I said okay.  I thought I had to go because &#8212; to help. <br><br>Well, one of the things I found out was: How am I going to take care of my two little boys?  Almost three and almost four.  I couldn&#8217;t afford daycare.  I couldn&#8217;t afford childcare.  Not a joke.  And I was making $42,000 a year, which was a lot of money, as a U.S. senator.  I couldn&#8217;t afford it.  Thank God I got a big family.  My dad would say, “Family is the beginning, middle, and the end.”  <br><br>My sister moved in, and I bought an old farmhouse.  And my brother was single, moved in.  Took a barn and turned it into an apartment.  Every morning, I’d drive to the train station to drop my kids off at my mom&#8217;s.  I had a lot of help.<br><br>But it made me realize: How about that single woman with a high-school education or less, with two little kids without a dad &#8212; how in God&#8217;s name they can make it.  And yet, how can they go to work? <br><br>The point being that if we just said anyone making under &#8212; a family making under 120 grand a year would not have to pay more than 7 percent of their income for childcare, we’d cut in half the cost of childcare on a yearly basis, making it easy for &#8212; much easier for a whole lot of people to be able to work.  It’d put over 200,000 women back in the job market who are leaving only because they can&#8217;t afford &#8212; can&#8217;t afford childcare. <br><br>Folks, imagine what that would mean to the standard of living for a household.<br><br>Folks, there&#8217;s no reason why we shouldn&#8217;t get a tax credit for weatherizing your homes.  (Applause.)  Make it more efficient to buy electric vehicles.  My plan does that.  <br><br>I met with nearly a dozen CEOs of America&#8217;s largest utility companies.  Literally a dozen of them came to see me.  They confirmed that if we pass the investments allowing families to &#8212; if they weatherize their homes, to write it off &#8212; a tax credit &#8212; it will immediately lower the bills of these families an average of $500 a year.<br><br>We can do these things without making a lot of sacrifices.  We just asked the large corporations, the wealthiest Americans just to begin to pay part of their fair share of taxes.  <br><br>No one making less &#8212; (applause) &#8212; no one making less &#8212; no one making under $400,000 a year, I promise you, will pay an additional penny in federal taxes.  I said that at the beginning, and I&#8217;ve kept that commitment.<br><br>Meanwhile, right now, the average billionaire &#8212; there’s about 790 of them or so in America &#8212; you know what their average tax rate is?  Eight percent.  E-I-G-H-T.  Eight percent.  Now &#8212; in federal taxes.  But most of you are likely paying two to three times that much. <br><br>No billionaire should be paying a lower tax rate than a teacher, a firefighter, an electrician, a cop.  (Applause.)  No, I mean it.  And they shouldn&#8217;t be paying 90 percent either.  If we just moved the tax rate back to 39 percent, we’d have enough money to pay for all these things &#8212; for them, for people making tens of millions of dollars. <br><br>This is about fairness.  It&#8217;s about dignity.  It&#8217;s about fiscal responsibility.<br><br>My Republican colleagues say these programs to help the working-class and middle-class people &#8212; that&#8217;s &#8212; they say that&#8217;s why we have inflation.  They&#8217;re dead wrong. <br><br>Under my predecessor, the great MAGA king, the deficit increased every single year he was President.  The first year of my presidency &#8212; the first year, I reduced the deficit &#8212; literally reduced the deficit by $350 billion.  First year.  (Applause.)<br><br>And this year &#8212; and this year, we&#8217;re on track to cut the federal deficit by 1 trillion 500 billion dollars &#8212; the biggest decline in debt ever in American history.  (Applause.)<br><br>It matters to families, because reducing the deficit is one of the main ways that we can ease inflationary pressures.<br><br>But pay close attention.  I believe in bipartisanship.  Right now, the majority of our Republican friends just see things differently.  They don&#8217;t want to solve inflation &#8212; inflation by lowering the costs.  They want to solve it by raising taxes and lowering your income. <br><br>Now, you think I&#8217;m making this up.  If I didn’t see the actual document, I’d think you &#8212; I was making it up.  I happen to think it’s good &#8212; a good thing when American families have more money in their pockets.  American workers deserve a raise. <br><br>All this concern &#8212; “Ameri- &#8212; wages went up 5 percent.  Oh my God.”  I thought that we were supposed to see happen. <br><br>Republicans in Congress have proposed a plan that will make working families and American families poorer.  Now, I&#8217;m not &#8212; I &#8212; you know, I&#8217;m not usually this discreet about my Republican friends.  I get along with a lot of them &#8212; used to anyway. <br><br>But Senator Rick Scott, a Republican from Florida, laid out a plan in writing &#8212; the Ult- &#8212; well, it’s called the &#8212; I call it the “Ultra-MAGA” plan &#8212; Make America Great Again plan.  It’s in writing.  <br><br>And here’s what it does: It raises taxes on 75 million American families, over 95 percent of whom earn less than $100,000 a year in a combined income.  It would raise taxes by nearly $1,500 per family.  It’s all in writing.  You can go online. <br><br>They’ve got it backwards. <br><br>I’ve proposed a minimum tax for billionaires, but congressional Republicans have proposed a minimum tax for teachers, firefighters, and electricians. <br><br>And while on this &#8212; you know, 55 of the Fortune 500 &#8212; Fortune 500 companies in 2020 &#8212; 55 of them paid zero in federal taxes after making $40 billion.  Forty billion dollars.  Zero in federal taxes.  It isn’t right.  <br><br>I proposed a minimum tax for corporations that asks them to pay their fair share in taxes.  Senator Scott’s plan lets them off, no pun intended, scot-free.<br><br>I want to strengthen Social Security benefits to make folks who have worked for their whole lives and have paid into it &#8212; make sure they have it. <br><br>I want to give Medicare the power to negotiate drug prices.  I want states to continue to expand Medicaid. <br><br>And the ultra-MAGA Republicans’ proposal puts &#8212; here’s what it does: It puts Social Security, Medicare &#8212; this is the Republican plan now; the only one out there &#8212; and Medicaid on the chopping block every five years.  <br><br>Here’s how it works: Their plan explicitly states that, every five years it will require a vote on whether or not to continue each of these programs.  Republicans in Congress want to put Medicare’s very existence up for a vote every five years.  Same with Social Security and Medicaid. <br><br>Now, really, ask yourself: How well are you going to sleep at night knowing that every five years everything you’ve paid into may not be there?<br><br>Not &#8212; this is &#8212; this is serious.  The MAGA Republicans are going to vote on whether you’ll have Social Security, Medicare, or Medicaid and what amount you get.  Every five years it’s reconsidered.<br><br>Now, I have to admit it’s unlikely they’ll vote Social Security totally out of existence.  But what do you think they’re likely to do if this were to pass?  I &#8212; I&#8217;ve been a &#8212; I&#8217;ve been in Congress a long time.  I was pretty good at what I did in Congress.  I guarantee you what they do every five years &#8212; they&#8217;ll hold hostages to get their way.<br><br>They’ll say, “If, in fact, you don&#8217;t vote for this particular thing, we&#8217;re going to cut Social Security.  We&#8217;re going to cut Medicaid.  We&#8217;re going to cut whatever.”<br><br>The idea you&#8217;d have to renegotiate Social Security every five years?  I mean, this is in writing.  Look it up.<br><br>You know, they&#8217;re going to say, “If you don&#8217;t stop investing in clean energy &#8212; because we don&#8217;t like it, we don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s global warming &#8212; we&#8217;re going to cut the following.”<br><br>Folks, this is not who we are.  So we&#8217;ve got to keep fighting for an economy that&#8217;s about fairness, dignity, and opportunity; that&#8217;s about America &#8212; about America.  <br><br>And, folks, you know, as my mother used to say, “Out of everything bad, Joey, something good will happen if you look hard enough for it.”  So let me close it this.<br><br>Last month, I visited the main airport in Portland, Oregon, which is undergoing major renovations being funded by the Bipart- &#8212; (applause) &#8212; being funded by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.   <br><br>I met a woman named Lauren of IBEW Local 48.  (Applause.)  She came up to me.  She shared what the job meant to her, how she grew up poor and was raised by a single mom, how she bounced around in different careers until she came in a &#8212; until she became an apprentice with the IBEW.<br><br>She’s putting in her years and the thousands of hours that she needs to put in to become a journeyman electrician.  Lauren told me that the airport will symbolize the crown jewel of the Pacific Northwest but it will also symbolize something else: a better life &#8212; a better life for an IBEW member.  That means fairness and dignity in the workplace. <br><br>And it’ll be a symbol for a better America because the IB- &#8212; IBEW is just getting started.<br><br>Folks, I promised you that I’d be the most pro-union President in American history &#8212; (applause) &#8212; because I know this: In a crisis, America always counts on you.  (Applause.)  So you can count on me to keep fighting for you!  (Applause.)  Keep going!  Keep building!  Keep the faith!  (Applause.)<br><br>God bless you all, and may God protect our troops.  Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.  (Applause.)  <br><br>4:49 P.M. CDT</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>On 150<sup>th</sup> Anniversary Of 1872 Mining Law, Biden-Harris Administration Convenes Representatives from States, Tribes, The Mining Industry, Environmental Groups, Legal Experts to Discuss Much Needed Reform to Outdated Law</em></p>



<p class="has-text-align-left"><br>Yesterday, the White House convened over 20 representatives from states, Tribes, the mining industry, environmental groups, labor unions, automakers, legal experts, and other stakeholders on the 150th anniversary of the signing of the Mining Law of 1872 to discuss the need for reforms and improvements to establish strong, 21st Century environmental and engagement standards that would allow for the responsible and sustainable development of domestic hardrock minerals.<br><br>This meeting was the first external engagement of the Department of Interior-led Interagency Working Group on Mining Regulations, Laws, and Permitting, which is charged with providing recommendations to Congress on how to reform the mining law to ensure new production meets strong environmental standards throughout the lifecycle of the project, ensure meaningful community consultation and consultation with Tribal nations, and reduce the time, cost, and risk of mine permitting.&nbsp; Additional stakeholder meetings will be held over the coming months, and comments can also be submitted in response to the Request for Information that was issued by the Department of the Interior on March 31. Comments can be made through July 31, 2022 at <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/document/DOI-2022-0003-0001">Regulations.gov</a>.<br><br>Participants discussed the shared benefits, challenges, and opportunities of reforming the current system. The General Mining Law of 1872 governs the extraction of critical and valuable minerals on federal lands across the country, and has remained fundamentally unchanged since Ulysses S. Grant signed it to promote westward expansion. The law does not require royalties to be paid to the taxpayers for the extraction and sale of valuable minerals, does not include any environmental, reclamation or financial assurance provisions, and fails to have a single department in charge of mining, leaving stakeholders and companies to navigate a morass of systems and laws. As we grow the clean energy economy, critical minerals for electric vehicles, large capacity batteries, wind turbines, and other clean energy technologies, such as lithium, cobalt, and nickel, are projected to increase in demand by 400-600% in the coming decades. The current global supply chains for these minerals too often fail to adhere to strong social and environmental standards, despite the demands of the end customers and companies. Creating a modern legal framework for the socially and environmentally responsible and sustainable mining and production of these minerals is essential to the Biden-Harris Administration’s efforts to strengthen our critical supply chains; the administration <a href="https://www.doi.gov/sites/doi.gov/files/biden-harris-administration-fundamental-principles-for-domestic-mining-reform.pdf">issued</a> principles for mining reform in February to guide this effort.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br>After participating in the convening, participants ranging from companies, Tribes, environmental groups, trade groups, experts, and labor unions all highlighted the importance of the discussion and common goals to improve the current system:<br><br><strong>Tom Palmer, President and CEO, Newmont Corporation</strong>: “Newmont Corporation was honored to be a part of today’s discussion with the White House on modernizing the General Mining Law. This historic gathering of diverse stakeholders, including federal and state government agencies and representatives, Native American leaders, Labor, NGOs, Academia, and consumers provided a rare opportunity to discuss updates to the Federal regulatory system to incentivize responsible domestic metals and minerals mining in a challenging global environment. We appreciate the Administration convening this productive session and initiating the discussion on the future of mining in the United States. We look forward to Newmont&#8217;s continued participation and collaboration.”&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Jennifer Krill, Executive Director, Earthworks</strong>: “Meeting the President’s climate and environmental justice goals depends on a shift in the way we source and use minerals. To ensure that our emerging clean energy system is not built on dirty mining, we must reform the rules of the road for mining and invest in creating a sustainable minerals economy. On this 150th anniversary of the 1872 Mining Law, Earthworks looks forward to working with the Biden-Harris administration and a broad group of stakeholders to promote a rapid, just, and equitable renewable energy transition using responsibly sourced materials.”<br><br><strong>Joe Britton, Executive Director, Zero Emission Transportation Association</strong>: &#8220;We had a great conversation today with a diverse array of federal, tribal, electric vehicle and critical mineral stakeholders committed to climate action, sustainable economies, and conservation. There was strong consensus on the need to both encourage community consultation and take action that reflects the urgency of responsibly procuring the critical minerals needed for climate solution technologies. ZETA thanks the Biden-Harris Administration for leading these tough discussions and looks forward to making progress on the decarbonization needed to make us all better off.”<br><br><strong>Rich Nolan, President and CEO, National Mining Association</strong>: “The NMA was pleased today to join the Biden administration’s Interagency Working Group on mining law reform at the White House. The strength of the U.S. economy depends on mining, and industry stands ready to work with the government to find a productive path forward that will help reshore essential supply chains, reduce our mineral import overreliance and build the materials industrial base needed to underpin the energy transition and the EV revolution. We look forward to continuing to contribute to the work of this important group.”<br><br><strong>Sam Penney, Chairman, Nez Perce: “</strong>The Nez Perce Tribe appreciates the White House convening the mining reform meeting today. Listening to the various perspectives of states, Tribes, and stakeholders is an important initial step. Protection of treaty reserved rights and upholding federal trust responsibility are critical aspects of mining reform.<strong>”</strong><br><br><strong>Collin O’Mara, President and CEO, National Wildlife Federation</strong>: “Responsibly mined critical minerals are essential for our clean energy future and our national security — and it’s time that we finally move our 19<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;century laws into the 21<sup>st&nbsp;</sup>century. President Biden and his administration have made it clear that they are serious about responsibly producing a secure domestic supply of critical minerals through reclamation, recycling, and new mining, while fully supporting communities and workers, remediating abandoned mines, and addressing the impacts on clean drinking water, lands, and wildlife and people alike.”<br><br><strong>Mark Bristow, President &amp; CEO, Barrick: </strong>“Barrick and Nevada Gold Mines value being part of the discussions today and look forward to continued collaboration with the federal government and other stakeholders. We support the initiative to improve the permitting process and regulatory regime with the objective of ensuring responsible mining of minerals and metals in the United States of America.”<br><br><strong>John Ruple, Professor of Law (Research) &amp; Wallace Stegner Center Fellow, S.J. Quinney College of Law, University of Utah</strong>: “The 150-year-old General Mining Law is like driving a stagecoach, and it’s time to trade in the stagecoach for an electric vehicle. Today’s meeting included a broad representation of mining stakeholders—from multinational mining corporations, to Tribes and environmentalists, to organized labor and academia—universally, we agree on the value in updating the 150-year-old general mining law to increase the supply of strategic minerals and an opportunity to improve environmental stewardship and collaboration with Native Nations. I am honored to work with the Biden-Harris Administration on efforts to bring mining law into the 21st century and to secure for America the critical minerals that we need for a transition to renewable energy in an environmentally responsible manner.”<br><br><strong>Yvette Pena-O&#8217;Sullivan, Executive Director of the Office of the President, Laborers&#8217; International Union of North America (LIUNA)</strong>: “I was pleased to be a part of the White House&#8217;s convening of stakeholders from labor, industry, environment, and tribal communities to discuss mining reform and remediation.&nbsp; Today&#8217;s meeting was an important step forward to securing a safe and domestic supply chain for critical minerals.&nbsp; The hard-working men and women of LIUNA who work on mineral mining projects too often have their livelihoods put on hold as permits are stalled due to outdated policies and a legal framework that dates to the 1870s. LIUNA commends the Biden-Harris Administration’s leadership in charting a new strategy on critical minerals that can help our nation build a vibrant clean energy economy responsibly.”&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Jason Walsh, Executive Director, BlueGreen Allilance:</strong> “As we work to grow the clean economy, demand for mined materials—such as copper, lithium, and nickel, as well as other minerals, metals, and rare earths—is only going to increase. We need&nbsp;a new national commitment to responsible mining and the reclamation and recycling of these minerals and materials. And we have to do this&nbsp;in ways that uphold our obligations to workers, communities, and the environment. We appreciate the administration convening this&nbsp;important&nbsp;conversation and we&nbsp;look forward&nbsp;to&nbsp;continuing to&nbsp;discuss and advance&nbsp;this issue with our partners.”<br></p>

<p>Q Madam Vice President, what does this vote mean? And what is your message to women and childbearing people in America about what’s next?</p>



<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yeah, so, I just presided over the Women&#8217;s Health Protective Act vote. And sadly, the Senate failed to stand in defense of a woman&#8217;s right to make decisions about her own body.</p>



<p>And let&#8217;s be clear, the majority of the American people believe in defending a woman&#8217;s right, her choice to decide what happens to her own body. And this vote clearly suggests that the Senate is not where the majority of Americans are on this issue.</p>



<p>It also makes clear that a priority for all who care about this issue &#8212; a priority should be to elect pro-choice leaders at the local, the state, and the federal level, because what we are seeing around this country are extremist Republican leaders who are seeking to criminalize and punish women for making decisions about their own body.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Via Teleconference</p>



<p>3:04 P.M. EDT</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; And thanks, everyone, for joining.&nbsp; So this call is on background.&nbsp; It is attributable to a “senior administration official.”&nbsp; And the contents of the call are embargoed until the end of the call.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For your awareness and not for reporting, our speaker on the call today is [senior administration official].&nbsp; So I&#8217;m going to turn it over to you to give some remarks and we can take some questions.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Great, guys.&nbsp; And thank you all for joining.&nbsp; And I&#8217;m sorry to be a couple of minutes late.&nbsp; We&#8217;re trying to balance, you know, 10 delegations here in Washington, so it&#8217;s substantial.&nbsp; And I’m grateful to [moderator] and her team for arranging this.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So I&#8217;d like to do a couple of things today.&nbsp; I&#8217;d like to explain and give you some background for the ASEAN Special Summit, which will be taking place here in Washington, D.C. &#8212; at the White House, at the Willard, and at the State Department &#8212; on Thursday and Friday.&nbsp; And then just preview quickly &#8212; and we&#8217;ll do more of this next week &#8212; the upcoming travel of the President to South Korea and Japan.</p>



<p>So, just quickly, I think as you know, President Biden very much looks forward to welcoming the leaders of ASEAN to Washington, D.C. &#8212; again, on Thursday or Friday &#8212; for full days of discussions the 12th and 13th for what we are calling a U.S.-ASEAN Special Summit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>And this is the first time in its 45-year history that ASEAN leaders will be welcomed together to Washington, D.C.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve had summit meetings before in the region, and also during the Obama administration, there was a meeting in Sunnylands.&nbsp; But this is the first time they&#8217;ve gathered together in Washington, D.C.</p>



<p>So just by way of background, guys: So, you know, we think this is important for obvious reasons.&nbsp; You know, there is a daily urgent set of demands as the West, the transatlantic community is engaging deeply on what&#8217;s going on on the battlefield in Ukraine.&nbsp; And that obviously takes an enormous amount of time, focus, energy, and resources currently of the senior leadership.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But it is also the case there is a deep recognition that fundamental long-term challenges are playing out in the Indo-Pacific.&nbsp; And the United States is committed and determining to ensuring that our engagement in the region is broad, is broad-based, and is sustained.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So part of that will be the hosting of the summit.&nbsp; Part of it will be the trip to South Korea and Japan.&nbsp; And as part of each of those stops, there&#8217;ll be a range of engagements, including the fourth Quad meeting at the leader level in just over a year.&nbsp; That will be hosted by Prime Minister Kishida in Tokyo on the 24th of May, next week or the week after next.</p>



<p>So for the U.S.-ASEAN Summit, the program is as follows:</p>



<p>On Thursday, tomorrow, Speaker Pelosi and other senior leaders from Capitol Hill will welcome the ASEAN leaders to the Capitol for a bipartisan working lunch.&nbsp; And, obviously, this is important because, for many years, one of the most important areas of engagement for Capitol Hill was in Southeast Asia, and that continues.</p>



<p>And so, it&#8217;s important that the leaders from the region see the bipartisan commitment to the Indo-Pacific that we certainly have seen over the course of the last year and half.</p>



<p>After that, the ASEAN leaders will move to the Willard, where they will meet senior American business leaders and CEOs to discuss ways of strengthening economic cooperation between one of the most dynamic regions on the planet and the United States.</p>



<p>They will be joined by a variety of folks, including Secretary of Commerce Raimondo and U.S. Trade Representative Ambassador Tai.&nbsp; There will be discussions at this session about key challenges ahead in technology, post-COVID recovery, issues associated with climate and energy.&nbsp; The desire is to have these senior &#8212; these senior business leaders from across the United States engage and think about how to engage more directly going forward, given the dynamism in the region as a whole.</p>



<p>After that, President Biden will be hosting the ASEAN Leaders for an intimate dinner in the White House, for an opportunity to listen to the leaders about their aspirations for where they want to take ASEAN and how the United States can help in that in the period ahead.</p>



<p>Day two: Vice President Harris and Secretary of State Blinken will host ASEAN leaders for a working lunch at the State Department, and it&#8217;s focused primarily on &#8212; the lunch &#8212; on maritime cooperation, pandemic recovery, and health security.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vice President Harris will also host a discussion with ASEAN leaders and other Cabinet officials from across the interagency regarding climate action, clean energy, and sustainable infrastructure.</p>



<p>Let me just take a moment here that &#8212; I think part of the ambition of this summit is to broaden and deepen not only the level of engagement in the U.S. government but in certain key parts of the government like the State Department, the White House, and DOD, but to broaden it across every element of our government.</p>



<p>So we are seeking discussions and programs on education, on maritime domain awareness, on forestry across the board.&nbsp; So the idea here is to make sure that the ASEAN leaders see the breadth and depth, again, of the U.S. commitment to ASEAN as a whole.</p>



<p>And as you know, this is building on an area of expertise for &#8212; and interest for Vice President Harris.&nbsp; She traveled to the region at the end of last year, and she&#8217;s interested and excited to engage with the leaders about opportunities for U.S. &#8212; enhancing U.S. ties with Southeast Asia going forward.</p>



<p>And then, later in the afternoon, President Biden will host a discussion with ASEAN leaders on how to deliver directly for people in the region and beyond.</p>



<p>So, you know, I think the desire here is to have an intense set of discussions with, again, all our senior officials who will all be present and business leaders to indicate how seriously we take the relationship between the United States and ASEAN.</p>



<p>And I think you can expect to see the United States taking steps to deepen our longstanding cooperation in a whole host of areas.&nbsp; We’ve got some ideas for how to pursue new avenues of dialogue.&nbsp; I think we&#8217;re going to be thinking about how to invest in our countries and work on driving inclusive prosperity.</p>



<p>And I think it is also clear that the United States will also focus on efforts to promote respect for human rights, the rule of law, and good governance.&nbsp; And we will together address the ongoing crisis and challenges in Burma.</p>



<p>On the President&#8217;s &#8212; so I’ll just take a minute, [senior administration official], really quickly &#8212; the President&#8217;s travel.&nbsp; He will be going &#8212; he will be going to South Korea to meet the new President who has just been sworn in.&nbsp; And he will then be proceeding to Japan.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We&#8217;ll have more details on the travels as we get closer, but I just want to understand that &#8212; you know, I want you to understand that, really, since the President&#8217;s inauguration, we&#8217;ve done a lot in the region.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I&#8217;ll just give you a couple of examples for background in your stories.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, we&#8217;re the first administration that has taken the Quad &#8212; that&#8217;s the United States, Australia, India, and Japan &#8212; to the leader level.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve had a number of meetings, and they all &#8212; again, as I’ve indicated &#8212; they will meet in Tokyo on the President&#8217;s travel.</p>



<p>We have decided for the first time in seven decades to share sensitive nuclear submarine technology with another country.&nbsp; We launched AUKUS that binds and bonds Australia, Great Britain, and the United States in a fundamental endeavor to deliver on the promise of nuclear-powered submarines.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But this partnership will also include more areas of technology cooperation with other countries.&nbsp; We’ll have more to report on that as we go forward.</p>



<p>I think what we have also seen is substantial engagement in the Pacific.&nbsp; It&#8217;s &#8212; clearly, the Indo-Pacific is a broad region, and too often we speak a lot about Southeast Asia, Northeast Asia, India.&nbsp; But it&#8217;s equally important to focus on the Pacific, and you will be seeing indications of that going forward.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve also broadened and deepened our discussion with Europe and Asia about each other.&nbsp; And we&#8217;ve seen unprecedented Indo-Pacific cooperation in the challenges that Europe has faced since the invasion &#8212; the Russian invasion of Ukraine, more generally.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, I think it&#8217;s a multifaceted approach.&nbsp; The President and our team will have more to say on details on the Indo-Pacific Economic Forum, some of the details of what we hope to accomplish in the Quad, a number of other initiatives that are in the works.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I think the sum total of the next couple of weeks is intended to send a concerted message that we are following through on the strategy of investing at home, working with top partners and allies, and laying out clearly what our goals and objectives in the Indo-Pacific are.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I&#8217;ll stop there.&nbsp; I’m happy to take a couple of questions.&nbsp; But that&#8217;s sort of the background about where we are.&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; Thank you, [senior administration official].&nbsp; That was a really helpful laydown of what&#8217;s to come in the coming days.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, Operator, could you please give us the directions on how to ask the questions?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey, [senior administration official].&nbsp; Thanks a lot for doing this.&nbsp; I just wanted to &#8212;</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Hi, John.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; (inaudible) &#8212; yeah, thanks.&nbsp; Is it true the President is not going to be doing any bilateral meetings with the ASEAN leaders in town?&nbsp; You probably saw the remark from the Cambodian minister who said that the U.S. hosts “should be more generous to guests.”&nbsp; I’m just curious if you think that’s a fair criticism.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; I had not seen those comments.&nbsp; I can just assure you that the United States is bending over backwards to be the best possible host.&nbsp; The President will have a quick, private time with each of the leaders.&nbsp; We put enormous effort into the program as a whole.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I would also just underscore that this is really a meeting with ASEAN as an institution, and we are in many ways following the recommendation of individual countries in the region that said that the United States has to take the necessary steps to bolster our engagement with the institution, and we&#8217;re seeking to do that.</p>



<p>So, we&#8217;re trying to balance opportunities for private interaction with individual countries but a larger engagement with ASEAN as a whole.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s exactly what we&#8217;ve done.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so, I would simply say that we have tried very hard to send a very constructive message of how deeply we want to work with partners in the region, and we&#8217;re grateful that so many countries have decided to join us in this endeavor.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Hi, [senior administration official].&nbsp; Thanks for doing this.&nbsp; I have two questions.&nbsp; The first one &#8212;</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Sure, Patsy.&nbsp; How are you?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I’m well, thank you.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I understand that the issue of Russia and Ukraine will be brought up.&nbsp; I’m wondering if you can give us some details about how hard would the President be pushing on Russia.&nbsp; For example, will you discuss the issue of secondary sanctions?&nbsp;</p>



<p>And then, if you could elaborate on your statement this morning that the U.S. wants ASEAN leaders to play a more deeply engaged role in Myanmar; I think that was the term that you that used.&nbsp; Will you be urging something more towards the enforcement of the five-point consensus or something beyond that?&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, just on the first question: First of all, I expect that there will be a broad discussion of Ukraine and Russia.&nbsp; I think ASEAN leaders are very interested to hear the American approach, both where things stand in terms of next steps.&nbsp; And I don’t want to get ahead of what is to come in terms of anything beyond that, but I expect that there will be a fulsome discussion on Ukraine, on Myanmar &#8212; on Burma.</p>



<p>I think, obviously, we’ve had substantial consultations with countries in the region and interested parties who are deeply focused and, frankly, frustrated by what we’ve seen take place inside the country.</p>



<p>I think we saw some of the initial steps that the ASEAN had taken.&nbsp; I think some of those steps have stalled, and we&#8217;re looking for an indication that ASEAN and, perhaps, the help from other countries supportive of ASEAN will take the lead in basically determining what are the appropriate next steps for the institution with respect to its demands and expectations inside the country.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, [senior administration official].&nbsp; Thanks &#8212; thanks for doing the call.&nbsp; I know that you said that you’ll release more details on the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework coming up soon, but what degree &#8212; to what degree do you expect to discuss that framework with the ASEAN leaders here?&nbsp; And maybe you could detail for us which ASEAN country you are aiming to get to join the framework, if at all.&nbsp;</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; So, look &#8212; and I very much appreciate the question.&nbsp; And I will say we are engaged in very substantial conversations with ASEAN countries and engaged in, you know, close deliberations on the way forward.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>And as I indicated, we will have more to say on this.&nbsp; But this is a subject of deep conversation not only between the leaders but expert groups that are meeting around the edges of every meeting currently.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hello.&nbsp; Radio Free Asia would like to know specifically, like, who is from &#8212; who is representing Myanmar, and is the National Unity Government involved in this summit in any way.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; So, again, we&#8217;ll have more to say on this tomorrow.&nbsp; We have had diplomatic engagement with the government in exile.&nbsp; We are in discussions about the best way to represent what has transpired in Burma and how to represent that in the meeting.</p>



<p>I think one of the discussions has been to have an empty chair to reflect our dissatisfaction with what&#8217;s taken place and our hope for a better path forward.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think we&#8217;ll have more to say about that.&nbsp; And, clearly, Burma will be a subject of intense deliberation in all of our meetings.</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Thank you, [senior administration official].&nbsp; And thanks, everyone, for joining.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a reminder, this call was on background, attributable to a “senior administration official,” and the contents of the call are embargoed until the end of the call.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you did not get your question in or have more questions, please feel free to reach out to me and we&#8217;ll get back to you for sure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thanks, everyone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Thank you so much, [senior administration official]. I really appreciate it.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>

<p>Once again – as fundamental rights are at risk at the Supreme Court – Senate Republicans have blocked passage of the Women’s Health Protection Act, a bill that affirmatively protects access to reproductive health care. This failure to act comes at a time when women’s constitutional rights are under unprecedented attack – and it runs counter to the will of the majority of American people.<br><br>Republicans in Congress – not one of whom voted for this bill – have chosen to stand in the way of Americans’ rights to make the most personal decisions about their own bodies, families and lives.   <br><br>To protect the right to choose, voters need to elect more pro-choice senators this November, and return a pro-choice majority to the House. If they do, Congress can pass this bill in January, and put it on my desk, so I can sign it into law.<br><br>The protections that the Women’s Health Protection Act would ensure are essential to the health, safety, and progress of our nation.  While this legislation did not pass today, my Administration will not stop fighting to protect access to women’s reproductive care. We will continue to defend women’s constitutional rights to make private reproductive choices as recognized in <em>Roe v. Wade</em> nearly half a century ago, and my Administration will continue to explore the measures and tools at our disposal to do just that.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">O’Connor Farm<br>Kankakee, Illinois</p>



<p>1:15 P.M. CDT</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Hello, hello, hello.&nbsp; Is this one working?&nbsp; There you go.&nbsp; Please, sit down.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the things I want to put to rest &#8212; everybody looks at me and says, “Have you ever been on a farm?”&nbsp; And I remind them that that no- &#8212; what nobody knows: I come from the state of Delaware; I represented Delaware for 36 years in the United States Senate before I became Vice President.&nbsp; The single-largest industry in Delaware and the Delmarva &#8212; Delaware, Maryland, Virginia peninsula; that peninsula that goes down &#8212; is agriculture.&nbsp; It’s a $4 billion industry.&nbsp; Four billion dollars &#8212; that whole peninsula.</p>



<p>And we have more chickens than there are Americans.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; More broilers.&nbsp; And so, you know, I’ve been very &#8212; let me put it this way: If I didn’t know something about farms, I’d have been a United States senator for 6 years, not 36 years.</p>



<p>But every part of the country is different.&nbsp; Every part of the country is different.</p>



<p>But before I go on, I want to pay a little bit of a tribute to this guy right here.&nbsp; I’m going to embarrass you a little bit.&nbsp; This is the man who happens to be the son of the owners of this farm.&nbsp; And this guy is doing &#8212; you know, there’s an old expression: God made man and then he made a few firefighters.&nbsp; Not a joke.&nbsp; Firefighters are incredible.&nbsp; Who else runs &#8212; who else is crazy enough to run into flames, you know?</p>



<p>But all kidding aside, what you’re doing in terms of helping conservation as well out in Wyoming is astounding.&nbsp; It really is.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I’ve been to &#8212; I don’t want to make you stand.&nbsp; I’m sorry.&nbsp; The &#8212; but the whole point of my raising this is &#8212; and we’re not going to be able to talk much about it today &#8212; but conservation is also pretty darn important and climate is pretty important.</p>



<p>I’ve been to every major fire but two this year, because FEMA is working again.&nbsp; We show up; we don’t wait.&nbsp; We don’t have to wonder.&nbsp; Governors only have to call me once.</p>



<p>And here’s the deal: More timber, more land, more buildings, more territory has been burned to the ground this year than the entire state of New Jersey, from New York all the way down to Virginia.&nbsp; The entire state of New Jersey.</p>



<p>And so, what this young man does is &#8212; amazing what they do, trying to &#8212; and it relates to lack of water in most of the places I’ve flown over &#8212; those reservoirs that were 200 feet deep that are now two inches deep.&nbsp; Literally, not figuratively.</p>



<p>So one of these days, I want to come back and talk to you all about conservation as well and climate.</p>



<p>But thank you for what you’re doing, man.&nbsp; You’re &#8212; I really mean it.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>Folks, I know it’s hot in here, so I’m not going to talk more than an hour and a half.&nbsp; (Laughter.)</p>



<p>Look, I want to make a few I think are fairly important points.</p>



<p>First of all, I want to thank Jeff for that introduction and &#8212; and you, Gina, for your hospitality you’ve extended today.</p>



<p>I joined Congresswoman Robin Kelly here &#8212; the real champion of working families and farmers &#8212; who represents this area, and I just do what she says.&nbsp; She sends a note to the White House, and I get it done.&nbsp; No, but she’s a key player on infrastructure &#8212; getting high-speed Internet, clean water to every person across this district.</p>



<p>And I know we &#8212; wanted to be here also was Dick Durbin and Tammy Duckworth, but they &#8212; and I mean they were going to come, but there’s a vote today in the United States and they’re unable to be here.&nbsp; They’re one of the &#8212; they&#8217;re two of the most genuine, reliable people that I’ve ever worked with, and I’ve been doing this for a few days.</p>



<p>And I want to thank Tom Vilsack.&nbsp; Tom and I became friends when Tom was governor in Iowa.&nbsp; We traveled the state.&nbsp; And Tom has forgotten more about farming than most people will ever learn.&nbsp; I’m sure this rooms knows as much, but the idea &#8212; Tom talks about how critically important that agriculture is to the United States in every single, solitary way.</p>



<p>But the real reason I’m here is to thank the American farmers &#8212; thank farmers.&nbsp; You feed America.&nbsp; You get us through &#8212; you got us through a pandemic.&nbsp; And you’re literally the backbone of our country.&nbsp; It’s not hyperbole.&nbsp; But you also feed the world.&nbsp; And we’re seeing with Putin’s war in Ukraine, you’re like the backbone of freedom.</p>



<p>You know, I was at factory not long ago, a couple &#8212; eight days ago, down in Alabama.&nbsp; And they make Javelin missiles to help the Ukrainians stave off the Russians, beat them back in their aggression.&nbsp; And I pointed out that &#8212; the proof point that America is the arsenal of democracy.&nbsp; That’s what they are.&nbsp; We always have been.&nbsp; We’ve been the arsenal of democracy.</p>



<p>And I stand here today to thank American farmers who are the &#8212; who are the breadbasket of democracy.&nbsp; You really are.</p>



<p>You know, we talk about &#8212; you know, every investment banker could leave their job.&nbsp; If every farmer left, we&#8217;d all starve to death.&nbsp; You know, let&#8217;s talk about what&#8217;s important to us.&nbsp; Everybo- &#8212; all these jobs are important.</p>



<p>But I &#8212; just think about it: Right now, America is fighting on two fronts.&nbsp; At home, it’s inflation and rising prices.&nbsp; Abroad, it’s helping Ukrainians defend their democracy and feeding those who are left hungry around the world because Russian atrocities exist.</p>



<p>And Jeff and the American farmers understand Putin’s war has &#8212; has cut off critical sources of food.&nbsp; Ukraine was the world’s largest producer of wheat and corn and cooking oil &#8212; but wheat, the largest.</p>



<p>For example, Ukraine says they have 20 million tons of grain in their silos right now &#8212; 20 million tons.&nbsp; And guess what?&nbsp; If those tons don&#8217;t get to market, an awful lot of people in Africa are going to starve to death because they are the sole &#8212; sole supplier of a number of African countries.&nbsp; Somalia &#8212; I won&#8217;t go through them all.</p>



<p>But the point is this: that because of what the Russians are doing in the Black Sea, Putin has warships &#8212; battleships preventing the access to Ukrainian ports to get this &#8212; this grain out, to get this wheat out.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The brutal war launched on Ukrainian soil has prevented Ukrainian farmers from planting next year’s crop and next year&#8217;s harvest.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And they&#8217;re not doing too damn &#8212; darn well in Russia either.&nbsp; Russia is the second-largest producer.</p>



<p>And &#8212; but we’re doing something about it.&nbsp; And our farmers are helping both &#8212; on both fronts, reducing the food &#8212; cost of &#8212; price of food at home and expanding production and feeding the world in need.</p>



<p>You know, I just toured Jeff’s beautiful family farm &#8212; 800 acres of soybeans, corn, and wheat.&nbsp; We talked about farmers all across America &#8212; what they&#8217;re experiencing today.</p>



<p>In addition to Putin’s war in Ukraine, it’s been cold and wet this spring, like it is cold today.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; We waited for 90-degree weather until I showed up here.</p>



<p>But, look, many farmers in the Midwest have been put behind the eight ball because of that.&nbsp; But it kept them from getting into their fields and planting crops.</p>



<p>But as Jeff just shared, American farmers always find a way.&nbsp; They always feel something extra &#8212; a spark of patriotism.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s not hyperbole.&nbsp; A spark of patriotism.&nbsp; A sense of never giving up, of always finding a solution.</p>



<p>To all of our farmers, I want you to know: Your congresswoman, me, the Secretaries of my Cabinet &#8212; we have your back.&nbsp; Robin has your back.&nbsp; She’s always looking at what’s going on in the agricultural world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, we’re reducing the red tape so it’s easier for farmers to conserve inputs and double crop.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For folks at home who don’t know what “double cropping” means: harvesting two different crops from the same field in the same year.&nbsp; And that’s what Jeff does with wheat and soybeans, which America is a top producer of &#8212; soybeans.</p>



<p>And wheat will be harvested around July 4th, if all goes well, God willing, and “the crick not rising,” as my grandfather would say.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But, look, then you plant soybeans on the same acreage.&nbsp; And he’ll tell you, double cropping comes with some real risks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The growing season for wheat is short, and if the weather conditions aren’t ideal or aren’t at least good, or there are other disruptions, then the timing of everything is thrown off.&nbsp; But it’s a risk we need to take.</p>



<p>That’s why my administration is looking at how to extend crop insurance coverage to give financial security to farmers like Jeff who practice double cropping.</p>



<p>Secondly, I want to also &#8212; farmers are worried about raising fer- &#8212; rising fertilizer costs and what is the content of the fertilizer.&nbsp; That’s why, earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced it would invest $250 million to boost fertilizer production.</p>



<p>Literally on the plane out here, on Air Force One, I turned to Tom and I said, “Tom, double that.&nbsp; Make it $500 million.&nbsp; It’s so desperately needed.&nbsp; We can’t take chances.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s critical to get this done.&nbsp; Now, when we &#8212; when we leave here today, I’m heading up to Chicago.&nbsp; You know where Tom is going?&nbsp; He’s getting &#8212; he’s heading to the airport &#8212; when we get to Air Force One &#8212; he’s heading to Germany, to the G7.&nbsp; That is all the democracies in Europe getting together and their agricultural teams getting together.&nbsp; North America, Europe, and Asia &#8212; they’re all part of it.&nbsp; And what &#8212; to solve some really big problems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They’re going to see what actions we can take to increase fertilizer suppliers globally and identify how we can work together to prevent export restrictions on food and agricultural inputs and bring more global production to market, which will stabilize prices and bring more certainty to our farmers and keep people from dying of hunger.</p>



<p>You know, this builds in other ways as well.&nbsp; My administration has been working to drive down the costs to farmers &#8212; and Tom mentioned it a little bit &#8212; and prices to consumers.</p>



<p>To reduce gas prices last month, I was in Iowa &#8212; a biofuel processing plant &#8212; at a biofuel processing plant.&nbsp; And I announced an emergency waiver to allow E15 gasoline to be sold across America during the summer.&nbsp; It&#8217;s an extraordinary effort, but it had to be done for this summer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>E15 uses more ethanol on crops grown here in Illinois and elsewhere around the country.&nbsp; And it can reduce the cost of a gallon of gasoline at the pump by 10 cents per gallon.&nbsp; Every little bit matters.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I know it&#8217;s a big deal.&nbsp; And Robin is a big supporter of this, and she&#8217;s pushing it in the House as well.&nbsp; Only four big companies, by the way, control more than half the markets for beef, pork, and poultry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Without meaningful competition, our farmers and ranchers have to pay whatever the four big re- &#8212; retailers are saying they&#8217;ll pay for their chickens, their hogs, and their cattle.&nbsp; These big companies can use their position as middlemen to overcharge grocery stores and, ultimately, families.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just consider this: Fifty years ago, ranchers got over 60 cents on every dollar spent to produce the beef they raised.&nbsp; Today, they get 39 cents.</p>



<p>Fifty years ago, hog farmers got 40 to 60 cents for each dollar the family spent raising that hog.&nbsp; Today, it&#8217;s about 19 cents.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And as big companies made massive profits, the prices you see at the grocery stores have gone up and the prices farmers receive has gone down.&nbsp; This reflects a market distorted by the lack of competition.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So last year, I signed &#8212; one of the first executive orders I signed was the &#8212; the competition on a &#8212; to make competition more available and level the playing field.&nbsp; And though the American Res- &#8212; through the American Rescue Plan, we’re investing about $1 billion to help smaller meat processors expand their capacity; give farmers, ranchers, and consumers more options and be- &#8212; better prices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Look, I&#8217;m a capitalist.&nbsp; But capitalism without competition is not capitalism.&nbsp; It&#8217;s exploitation.&nbsp; It&#8217;s exploitation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Folks, we can make sure that American agricultural exports will make up for the gap in Ukrainian supplies.&nbsp; In fact, during my first year in office, American agriculture exports shattered all previous records: $177 billion last year alone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I remind people: My predecessor did not come close.</p>



<p>By traveling in our &#8212; you know, by &#8212; we can&#8217;t &#8212; we have to keep investing in our farmers to reduce the costs, to reduce prices to consumers, and have the most productive, most efficient farmers in the world here in the United States.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve always combined generations of know-how with cutting-edge technology to feed us and the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I&#8217;m going to keep fighting for family farmers like Jeff so they can do what they do best.&nbsp; I hope Congress is going to join me &#8212; I know Robin is going to fight like hell to have it happen &#8212; in working hard to invest in farmers like Jeff and feed America and the world.&nbsp; That&#8217;s what we have to do.</p>



<p>Let me close with this: Look at the family farms like this one as a reminder of the bounty, beauty, and generosity of this nation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I know this &#8212; and you’re tired of hearing me say this for the last two years.&nbsp; It’s never, ever &#8212; I always &#8212;</p>



<p>I was on the Tibetan Plateau with Xi Jinping.&nbsp; I’ve traveled with him and spent more time with him than any other world leader has in China.</p>



<p>And he said &#8212; he was talking about why America is a diminishing power.&nbsp; And I said, “Mr. President, it’s never been a good bet to bet against the American people.&nbsp; No one has ever won betting against the American people.”</p>



<p>And I said, “And, by the way, you asked me…”&nbsp; He went on and he said, “Can you define America for me?”&nbsp; Just me and a translator, and him and a translator.&nbsp; Simultaneous translation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By the way, I turned all my notes over to the State Department.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; It matters.</p>



<p>But, you know, what happened was, he said, “Can you define America for me?”&nbsp; And this is the God’s truth because &#8212; been quoted a thousand times now.&nbsp; I said, “Yes, one word: possibilities.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’re the only nation in the world &#8212; the only nation in the world that has come out of every crisis stronger than we went in it, every single time, regardless of what it was.&nbsp; No other nation has done that.</p>



<p>It’s one of the reasons why in some places we’re called the “ugly Americans.”&nbsp; We think we can do anything.&nbsp; We know we can do anything.&nbsp; We know.</p>



<p>This nation leads the world.&nbsp; We stand up for freedom.&nbsp; We’re the United States of America.&nbsp; And when we are united, there’s not a damn thing we can’t do.&nbsp; That’s not hyperbole.&nbsp; It’s a fact.&nbsp; As a student of history, it’s a fact.&nbsp; There’s nothing beyond our capacity when we work together.&nbsp; Nothing.</p>



<p>So, I’m here to say: God bless our farmers.&nbsp; And I mean this sincerely.&nbsp; God protect our firefighters.&nbsp; And may God protect our troops.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thank you for what you do.&nbsp; America owes you.&nbsp; They owe you big.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;</p>

<p>11:51 A.M. EDT<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Hey, guys.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hello.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Hello.&nbsp; Hello.&nbsp; Good morning. &nbsp;Okay.&nbsp; Just two things for you at the top. &nbsp;And I&#8217;ll try and speak as loud as I can.<br>&nbsp;<br>All right.&nbsp; Good morning.&nbsp; Thanks for joining us for President Biden’s trip to Illinois.&nbsp; As you know, our first stop is to Kankakee, where the President will visit O’Connor Farms, a family farm owned by Jeff and Gina O’Connor.&nbsp; The farm is 800 acres and grows wheat, corn, and soybeans.<br>&nbsp;<br>The O’Connors use double cropping of wheat and soybeans on their farm, which, for those unfamiliar, means harvesting two crops from the same field in a given year.&nbsp; They are currently growing wheat that we will be &#8212; that will be harvested in July and then will double crop with soybeans on those same acres. They al- &#8212; they are also in the process of planting corn on their other acres.<br>&nbsp;<br>President Biden will be joined by Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack.&nbsp; The President will highlight the impact of Putin’s invasion of Ukraine on our domestic and global food supply and the war’s contribution to the rise in food prices at home and abroad.<br>&nbsp;<br>Fighting inflation and lowering costs for Americans is the President’s top priority, and he will deliver remarks on the effect of Putin’s price hike on the cost of food and energy.&nbsp; He will describe his administration’s action to support farmers and food processors &#8212; (clears throat) &#8212; excuse me &#8212; lower their cost and lower prices for families.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Later in the day, the President will address the IBEW’s &#8212; International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers &#8212; 40th Convention, where he will discuss his support for union jobs in the infrastructure and energy industries; increasing the number of countries eligible for double cropping insurance so that we can boost food production; increasing technical assistance for precision agriculture, allowing farmers to use less fertilizer without reducing yields; and doubling our investment for domestic fertilizer production to $500 million.<br>&nbsp;<br>Later in the day, the President will address the IBEW’s 40th Convention where he will discuss his support for union jobs in the infrastructure and energy industries.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Throughout the day, the President will be joined by Governor J. B. Pritzker; Congresswoman Robin Kelly &#8212; we’ll be in her district; and one &#8212; of course, many IBEW labor leaders at their convention.&nbsp; And we’ll be in her district at the farm, just to be clear there.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>One last thing I just want to note is that, yesterday, the Senate confirmed Lisa Cook to be the first Black woman to ever serve on the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve.&nbsp; Not only does Dr. Cook make history with this confirmation, but she is eminently qualified for this position at a critical moment of our economic process.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>We call on the Senate to swiftly confirm Jerome Powell and Philip Jefferson this week as well.<br>&nbsp;<br>With that, Zeke, you want to kick us off?<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Karine.&nbsp; Does the White House, does the President have any response to the killing of Al Jazeera journalist and American citizen Shireen Abu Akleh?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Yes.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And will that affect the President&#8217;s trip &#8212; planned trip to Israel next month?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; So, we strongly condemn the killing of Al Jazeera journalist and American citizen Shireen Abu Akleh in Jenin today, and we extend our deepest condolences to her family.&nbsp; We call for a thorough investigation to determine the circumstances of her death.&nbsp; Investigating attacks on independent media and prosecuting those responsible are of paramount importance.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>We will continue to promote media freedom and protect journalists’ ability to do their jobs without fear of violence, threats to their lives or safety, or unjust detention.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>I don&#8217;t have anything else to preview about his trip.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And does the President plan to make any calls to Israeli officials about this or her family, or anything of that sort?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; I &#8212; I&#8217;m happy to check, but I don&#8217;t have anything right now to preview on any calls that he&#8217;ll be making.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I ask a question about the ASEAN Summit that&#8217;s coming up?&nbsp; Can you give me a broad sense of what the President hopes to achieve from that, please?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; So, today, at around two o&#8217;clock &#8212; I think 2:45 &#8212; we&#8217;ll have a preview call.&nbsp; We&#8217;ll &#8212; we&#8217;ll have the full schedule and also, clearly, take questions from your colleagues since you guys are here with us heading to Illinois.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>We&#8217;ll have more on deliverables tomorrow, so we&#8217;ll probably do a backgrounder on that &#8212; a preview call on that.&nbsp; But you can expect to see us deepen our longstanding cooperation by investing in our countries and driving inclusive prosperity in this critical region.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>At the end of last year, President Biden announced $102 million in new initiatives to expand our engagement with ASEAN on COVID-19 recovery and health security, fighting the climate crisis, stimulating broad-based economic growth, and deepening people-to-people ties.&nbsp; We will keep building on this.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And, you know, I would push back on any of the characterizations that are out there that the U.S. hasn&#8217;t done much in the region since TPP, which never went into effect in the first place.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>We have long, strong &#8212; we have strong trade and investment relationships in the region; for example, the ASEAN countries &#8212; collectively, the United States’ fourth-largest goods trading partner.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>We saw U.S. exports of goods to the Asia-Pacific increase in 2021 by 25 percent from 2020, U.S. imports increase in 2021 by 19 percent from 2020.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve seen also &#8212; we&#8217;ve also seen increased foreign direct investment between the U.S. and the Asia-Pacific.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And as you all know, we&#8217;ve also been developing an Indo-Pacific Economic Framework to deepen our economic presence in the region.&nbsp; We’ll have more to say on this soon and are encouraged to see the int- &#8212; the interests of partners in the region.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just on ASEAN, can I ask you about &#8212; you talked about trade and economic issues.&nbsp; What about human rights?&nbsp; How does that fit into the ASEAN (inaudible)?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; I mean, that is something that clearly we &#8212; we are monitoring, and that is &#8212; it’s something that&#8217;s important to this administration.<br>&nbsp;<br>Clearly, that is &#8212; you know, it&#8217;s &#8212; it is something that, when you think about Cambodia, that&#8217;s the question that we tend to get.<br>&nbsp;<br>You know, the President and our administration has been clear about human rights concern and promoting human rights in Cambodia, just as an example.<br>&nbsp;<br>The President will, of course, not hold back from expressing his views and his priorities to promote human rights in that region.<br>&nbsp;<br>The summit is a &#8212; is a U.S.-ASEAN Summit, and Cambodia is the chair of the ASEAN, as you know.&nbsp; So, the leaders &#8212; so the leaders of that &#8212; of that summit as well &#8212; as well &#8212; the ASEAN General &#8212; Secretary General were invited; the different countries: Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam.<br>&nbsp;<br>And so, it&#8217;s &#8212; a nonpolitical represent- &#8212; representative of Burma was invited to the summit in accordance of ASEAN&#8217;s 2021 decision to restrict Burma&#8217;s participation in high-level ASEAN meetings due to the military regime&#8217;s failure to implement the ASEAN five-point consensus.<br>&nbsp;<br>We understand that Burma has declined that option, but that is something that, clearly, we will &#8212; the President will (inaudible).<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karine, have you or the Pre- &#8212; have you seen or has the President seen the situation with the women&#8217;s team at the Delaware State University, where they got pulled over in Georgia?&nbsp; They claimed they were subject to an unfair and unlawful search looking for drugs and whatnot.&nbsp; Do you know about that?&nbsp; Does he know about that?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; I actually don&#8217;t.&nbsp; This is the first I&#8217;m hearing of that.&nbsp; I&#8217;m happy to look into that and get back to you, but I actually don’t &#8212; have not heard that one.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wanted to see if you guys have a quick comment on the arrest of the Catholic cardinal in Hong Kong and the other activists there.&nbsp; Did you have anything on that?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Yes, I do.&nbsp; Give me one second.<br>&nbsp;<br>So, freedom of expression are critical to prosperous and secure societies. &nbsp;We call on PC- &#8212; PRC and Hong Kong authorities to cease targeting Hong Kong’s advocates and to immediately release who have been unjustly detained and charged, like the Cardinal Joseph Zen Ze-kiun and others arrested today.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karine, Senator Joe Manchin just said that he would be opposing the legislation today on the abortion vote.&nbsp; What message does it send to the country and to the nine justices that you’re going to have a bipartisan majority voting against this legislation?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; So &#8212; and you’re talking about the Women’s Health Protection Act?<br>&nbsp;<br>So, we put a statement of administration policy out, and so this is the message that we have. &nbsp;And, clearly, the urgency to protect women’s health, their fundamental right to control their reproductive choices, and the freedom of all people to build their own future has never been greater.<br>&nbsp;<br>The position of the Biden administration has been clear since day one: We will defend women’s constitutional rights recognized in Roe v. Wade &#8212; rights that have been under attack for decades and are under unprecedented threat now despite strong support from the American people.</p>



<p>It is evident that the constitutional rights protected for nearly 50 years, as Roe v. Wade, are now in severe jeopardy.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is imperative for Congress to act to adap- &#8212; to adopt statutory protections for women’s access to healthcare services and productive [reproductive] choices &#8212; productive [reproductive] choice, regardless of where they live.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Congress must further act to protect healthcare providers’ ability to provide such critical services free from unwarranted, inappropriate restrictions, and to eliminate unjustified burdens of commerce that prevent women and their families from participating fully and equally in the economic and social life of the &#8212; social life of the United States.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The protec- &#8212; the protections that Women’s Health Protection Act would ensure are essential to the health, safety, and progress of our nation.&nbsp; So that is what we put out there in support of that.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karine, just on inflation, as we’re about to land.&nbsp; I know the new numbers today show that inflation slowed somewhat, but core inflation actually jumped up about 0.6 percent.&nbsp; Are you guys concerned that even though prices may start trending down that, at the root of it all, inflation is still a real problem?<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; So, you know, we’re been clear-eyed in talking about the challenges driving inflation around the globe.&nbsp; As the President said yesterday, the first cause was the pandemic &#8212; the bottlenecks that has caused around &#8212; that has caused around the globe.&nbsp; And there’s no doubt that Putin’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine has also led to high &#8212; higher commodity prices and pain for Americans at the pump.<br>&nbsp;<br>But we know prices are too high on too many Am- &#8212; things for &#8212; on too many things for Amer- &#8212; working Americans.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>That’s why the President is using every tool we have to drive down the costs.&nbsp; That includes historic release of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, announcement this week on lowering the prices of Internet access of millions of Americans, and the President’s travel today to Illinois to speak with farmers about how we can do to lower their costs and help them produce more.&nbsp; And you’ll hear more about that from him later today.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Go ahead.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, you know, we’re starting to see, on the back of the report today, private market forecasts that are suggesting that we won&#8217;t see a significant deceleration of inflation until early next year, including all of the steps you&#8217;re taking, including the predicted path of Fed policy.&nbsp; Is that consistent with your estimates at this point?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp;&nbsp;Look, you know &#8212; I mean, I guess, more top- &#8212; topically, I would say that: You know, it&#8217;s heartening that the annual inflation cooled in April, which is what we saw. But as the President said yesterday, inflation is unacceptably high and bringing down prices is his top priority.&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#8217;s going to be our main focus.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>I leave the prediction to the Fed &#8212; Federal Reserve and other experts, but his plan is focused on lowering the cost that families face and reducing the federal &#8212; the federal deficit.&nbsp; And so, that&#8217;s going to be &#8212; that&#8217;s going to be our focus for moving forward.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The President’s executive order on cryptocurrency a few months ago &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; set out some research.&nbsp; Agencies were going to spend a few months looking at it, come back with proposals.&nbsp; That market is in significant movement right now.&nbsp; Bitcoin has lost something like more than half its value.&nbsp; So I guess the question is: Should regulators move quicker in light of the, you know, recent movement on crypto now that there are signs of, you know, systemic problems or at least a sharp plunge in the sector?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; So, just like the stock market, as you know, we don&#8217;t judge the economy by the daily movement of crypto.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>But as you know, all &#8212; as well, crypto is a highly volatile asset.&nbsp; It&#8217;s why the President signed an EO outlining the first ever whole-of-government approach to addressing the risks and opportunities of digital assets.&nbsp; Reviews of digital assets, including crypto, is underway across agencies.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>But I don&#8217;t have anything right now to preview, but that is something that we&#8217;re looking at that’s being reviewed.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You’re not planning on &#8212; for speeding it up or changing course, given the movements we&#8217;ve seen in the last couple of &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; No, I don’t &#8212; I mean, I just don’t have anything more than what I just stated.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Can I ask &#8212; on baby formula, there&#8217;s been severe shortages throughout much of the country over many weeks and months, but particularly the last couple of weeks.&nbsp; What is the administration doing?&nbsp; What can you do?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, that’s something certainly we&#8217;ve been tracking.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ensuring that &#8212; so ensuring that infant form- &#8212; formula is safe and available for families across the country is a top priority to the White House and this administration.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>We know that Abbott&#8217;s voluntary recall of infant formula products has led to some Americans being unable to access infant formula and other critical medical food supply.&nbsp; This is an urgent issue that the FDA, as you all know, and the White House is working 24/7 to address.&nbsp; They are committed to pulling every lever and are ready to making progress and getting more supply onto the market.<br>&nbsp;<br>In fact, in April, sales were about 10 percent greater than in March.&nbsp; Right now, consumers should be able to find general powdered infant formulas in stores, but we are focused on doing everything we can to ensure formula is more easily available.<br>&nbsp;<br>Just a couple of things I&#8217;ll read out really quickly &#8212; what FDA is doing.&nbsp;&nbsp;They&#8217;re working closely with industry to maximize their production capabilities by opening new lines for products in high demand, expediting FDA reviews to mo- &#8212; to more efficiently get supply out, and expanding hours of operation for manufacturers; expediting the importance [importation] of products produced aboard [abroad]; calling on retailer groups to consider placing purchase limits on some products to avoid the possibility of hoarding that could further constraint the market.<br>&nbsp;<br>And anyone who needs certain speci- &#8212; specific and metabolic formulas should consult their healthcare providers for guidance and alternatives to their current formula.<br>&nbsp;<br>I can take one right now.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karine &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Yeah.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; who’s running point on the formula issue at the White House?&nbsp; You mentioned the White House is involved.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; I mean, I &#8212; at the White House, I don&#8217;t &#8212; I don’t know.&nbsp; I can find out for you and get you a person who&#8217;s running point.&nbsp; But I don&#8217;t have a (inaudible).<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You got time for one on Putin?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Yeah.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just on the DNI’s testimony.&nbsp; She said Putin might take drastic means, escalatory optio- &#8212; military options and might view losing as an existential threat.&nbsp; How does that assessment change how you guys are dealing with the situation over there?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; I mean &#8212; so, look, it’s clear that Putin has not been able to accomplish the objectives he’s laid out before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.&nbsp; Russia has failed to overthrow the Ukrainian government.&nbsp; They lost the Battle of &#8212; for Kyiv and were forced to retreat and re- &#8212; refocus elsewhere.&nbsp; And they have failed to divide the West.<br>&nbsp;<br>Look, the &#8212; you know, when it comes to &#8212; you know, you hear the question about diplomacy.&nbsp; Diplomacy is the only way to end this conflict, but Russia has shown no signs that they are willing to seriously engage in negotiations.&nbsp; So, we are focused on strengthening Ukraine’s hand as possible on the battlefields so that when the time comes, they have as much leverage as possible at the negotiation table.<br>&nbsp;<br>But, again, as we’ve said over and over again, this is &#8212; this is Russia’s war.&nbsp; They &#8212; they created this war.&nbsp; They invaded Ukraine in a brutal way.&nbsp; And so, what Ukraine is doing is they are defending themselves and their democracy.&nbsp; So, this is for Russia to end this war.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Karine.<br>&nbsp;<br>12:08 P.M. EDT</p>
