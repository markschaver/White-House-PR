<p>President Joseph R. Biden spoke today with His Majesty King Abdullah II of Jordan to consult on a range of regional and global issues.  The two leaders discussed in detail recent efforts to stem violence in Israel and the West Bank, including at the Haram al-Sharif/Temple Mount complex in Jerusalem.  The President welcomed recent steps to reduce tensions and expressed his hope that the final week of Ramadan will pass peacefully.  He underscored the need to preserve the historic status quo at the Haram al-Sharif/Temple Mount, and recognized the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan’s role as the custodian of Muslim holy places in Jerusalem.  The King briefed the President on his recent engagements in the region and the President emphasized the U.S. commitment to the Middle East and regional stability.</p>

<p>No one should die from a mosquito bite. Seventy years ago, the United States eliminated malaria in our country. And, thanks to strong bipartisan leadership in Congress, and the enormous generosity of the American people, we lead the fight to end malaria worldwide.</p>



<p>As the largest donor in the battle to end malaria, the United States has helped save more than 10.6 million lives and prevent 1.7 billion malaria infections in partner countries around the world. Together with our partners, we have developed the knowledge and toolset – including the promising new malaria vaccine &#8211; to end malaria illness and death in our lifetime. We have worked together to bolster health systems and invest in health workers. We will continue to invest in research and expand our partnerships with regional and multilateral institutions to ensure science is driving our response.</p>



<p>Tragically, a child still dies every two minutes from malaria. We must step up and do more to finish this fight. We risk losing valuable progress as the disease develops resistance to drugs and mosquitoes develop resistance to insecticides. And, as climate change causes warmer, wetter, and more extreme weather, malaria-carrying mosquitoes will be able to breed and spread their disease more easily. That’s why I am proud to host the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria’s Replenishment Conference later this year. Working with allies and partners around the world, we can accelerate the fight against malaria and advance progress towards the Sustainable Development Agenda.</p>



<p>My Administration is committed to making the vision of a malaria-free future a reality. Together, we can build a safer, more prosperous, and more equitable world for everyone.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>Over the last decade, unmanned aircraft systems (UAS or “drones”) have become a regular feature of American life. We use them for recreation, for research, and for commerce. But the proliferation of this new technology has also introduced new risks to public safety, privacy, and homeland security.&nbsp; Malicious actors have increasingly used UAS domestically to commit crimes, conduct illegal surveillance and industrial espionage, and thwart law enforcement efforts at the local, state and Federal level.<br><br>Today, the Biden Administration is releasing the first whole-of-government plan to address UAS threats in the Homeland. Through the <strong>Domestic Counter-Unmanned Aircraft Systems National Action Plan</strong>, the Administration is working to expand <em>where</em> we can protect against nefarious UAS activity, <em>who</em> is authorized to take action, and <em>how </em>it can be accomplished lawfully. The Plan seeks to achieve this legitimate expansion while safeguarding the airspace, communications spectrums, individual privacy, civil liberties and civil rights. To achieve this balance, the Administration is calling on Congress to adopt legislation to close critical gaps in existing law and policy that currently impede government and law enforcement from protecting the American people and our vital security interests.<br><br>UAS serve many beneficial commercial and recreational purposes.&nbsp; As has been the case with many technological advances, they can also be exploited for pernicious purposes.&nbsp; To protect our Homeland and prevent their growing use from threatening the safety and security of our people, our communities, and our institutions, this Counter-UAS National Action Plan will set new ground rules for the expanding uses of UAS and improve our defenses against the exploitation of UAS for inappropriate or dangerous purposes.<br><br><strong><em>Recommendations</em></strong><br>The Plan provides eight key recommendations for action:</p>



<ol><li>Work with Congress to enact a new legislative proposal to expand the set of tools and actors who can protect against UAS by reauthorizing and expanding existing counter‑UAS authorities for the Departments of Homeland Security, Justice, Defense, State, as well as the Central Intelligence Agency and NASA in limited situations. The proposal also seeks to expand UAS detection authorities for state, local, territorial and Tribal (SLTT) law enforcement agencies and critical infrastructure owners and operators.  The proposal would also create a Federally-sponsored pilot program for selected SLTT law enforcement agency participants to perform UAS mitigation activities and permit critical infrastructure owners and operators to purchase authorized equipment to be used by appropriate Federal or SLTT law enforcement agencies to protect their facilities;<br></li><li>Establish a list of U.S. Government authorized detection equipment, approved by Federal security and regulatory agencies, to guide authorized entities in purchasing UAS detection systems in order to avoid the risks of inadvertent disruption to airspace or the communications spectrum; <br></li><li>Establish oversight and enablement mechanisms to support critical infrastructure owners and operators in purchasing counter-UAS equipment for use by authorized Federal entities or SLTT law enforcement agencies;<br></li><li>Establish a National Counter-UAS Training Center to increase training accessibility and promote interagency cross-training and collaboration;<br></li><li>Create a Federal UAS incident tracking database as a government-wide repository for departments and agencies to have a better understanding of the overall domestic threat;<br></li><li>Establish a mechanism to coordinate research, development, testing, and evaluation on UAS detection and mitigation technology across the Federal government;<br></li><li>Work with Congress to enact a comprehensive criminal statute that sets clear standards for legal and illegal uses, closes loopholes in existing Federal law, and establishes adequate penalties to deter the most serious UAS-related crimes; and <br></li><li>Enhance cooperation with the international community on counter‑UAS technologies, as well as the systems designed to defeat them.<br><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/eo13985-vision-for-equitable-data.pdf"></a></li></ol>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>America’s veterans are the best of us. I’ve always believed that we have a sacred obligation to equip all those we send into harm’s way and to care for them and their families when they come home. That’s especially true for veterans suffering the visible and invisible wounds of war, whether they were injured in combat or breathed in toxic smoke from burn pits on base. We can and must do more to address the harms that come from hazardous exposures, which have gone unaddressed for far too long.</p>



<p>We learned a horrible lesson after Vietnam, when the harmful effects of exposure to Agent Orange sometimes took years to manifest, and too many veterans were left unable to access the care they needed. I refuse to repeat that mistake when it comes to the veterans of our wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>



<p>In my State of the Union address, I announced that we would propose expanding disability and health benefits to veterans suffering from nine rare respiratory cancers. Today, the Department of Veterans Affairs is delivering on that promise and upholding that sacred obligation to the women and men who have worn the uniform of our country. This new action is guided by science and driven by a desire to ensure that our nation’s veterans receive timely access to the benefits and services they deserve.</p>



<p>Supporting our veterans is a critical part of the Unity Agenda I proposed for our nation. No matter where we live or who we voted for in the last election, we all agree that we should serve our veterans as well as they have served us. My Administration will continue to do everything in its power to support our nation’s veterans, and I urge Congress to pass bipartisan legislation to comprehensively address toxic exposures and further deliver the vital benefits our veterans have earned. I will sign it immediately.</p>

<p>President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. spoke today with Prime Minister Naftali Bennett of Israel to discuss shared regional and global security challenges, including the threat posed by Iran and its proxies. The two leaders emphasized the strong personal bond they have developed since the Prime Minister’s visit to Washington last summer. This personal relationship has animated the work of our diplomatic and national security teams, enabling both countries to arrive at common positions on difficult matters. The President welcomed the visit to Washington this week by the Prime Minister’s National Security Advisor. The President also accepted an invitation to visit Israel in the coming months. The President took note of ongoing efforts between Israeli and Palestinian officials to lower tensions and ensure a peaceful conclusion to the holy season of Ramadan. He affirmed his unwavering support for Israel and its defense needs, and welcomed the historic $1 billion allocation to replenish Israel’s Iron Dome system. The two leaders committed to stay in regular contact to follow up on the important work of the U.S-Israel Strategic Consultative Group, chaired by their respective National Security Advisors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>Jill and I and the entire Biden family are saddened to learn of the passing of Orrin Hatch, the longest-serving Senator in Utah’s history, and the longest-serving Republican Senator in our nation’s history.</p>



<p>Orrin Hatch once shared in an interview that he had a soft side, and he had a tough side. To serve with Orrin, as I did for over three decades, was to see—and appreciate—both.</p>



<p>He was the fighter who carried with him the memory of his humble upbringing near Pittsburgh, who never humored a bully, or shied from a challenge. The young man who, upon receiving his degree from Brigham Young University, was the first in his family to graduate college; the young lawyer who built a successful law practice; and the Senator who sprinted from meeting to meeting because there was so much to do—indeed, when Senator Hatch retired, he had sponsored or co-sponsored more legislation than any Senator at the time.</p>



<p>I saw that energetic, sharp-elbowed Orrin in the many battles we had over tax policy, the right of workers to join a union, and many others.</p>



<p>At the same time, Senator Hatch was also a man of deep faith; a gentle soul who wrote songs and poems, and shared them with friends, colleagues, and the world. This was the Orrin who looked out for the people who often didn’t have a voice in our laws and our country. I saw this in his efforts to pass the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Children’s Health Insurance Program.</p>



<p>When I first launched the Cancer Moonshot as Vice President, one of the first visits I made was to the Huntsman Cancer Institute in Salt Lake City, at Orrin’s request. We both saw speeding the pace of cancer research as an issue that transcended political divisions.</p>



<p>When I cast my 10,000<sup>th</sup> vote in the Senate, Orrin came to the Senate floor and we had a chance to speak. I said that the greatest perk one has as a Senator was access to people with serious minds, a serious sense of purpose, and who cared about something. That was Orrin.</p>



<p>He was, quite simply, an American original.</p>
