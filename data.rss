<p class="has-text-align-center">June 11, 2021</p>



<p>7:13 P.M. BST</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Good evening, everyone.&nbsp; Thank you so much for joining us for this background briefing, and apologies for running a few minutes behind.<br>&nbsp;<br>In today&#8217;s background briefing, we&#8217;re going to preview tomorrow&#8217;s G7 working session on China.&nbsp; This call will be on background, attributable to &#8220;senior administration officials,&#8221; and under embargo until Saturday, June 12th, 7:00 a.m. British Summer Time.&nbsp; We, of course, will have some time for Q&amp;A at the end.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Not for reporting or attribution, but just for your knowledge, on today&#8217;s call we have joining us [senior administration officials].<br>&nbsp;<br>With that, I&#8217;ll pass it off to [senior administration official] to kick us off.<br>&nbsp;<br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Thanks very much.&nbsp; So, first, I&#8217;ll do a quick roundup of today.&nbsp; Today was the first G7 working session on the global economy, where President Biden and G7 leaders discussed ways to forge a more fair, sustainable, inclusive global economy.<br>&nbsp;<br>We also announced that President Biden will welcome German Chancellor Angela Merkel to the White House on July 15th &#8212; a visit that will affirm the deep bilateral ties between the U.S. and Germany.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And following on the President’s speech last night, the G7 and guest countries agreed to provide more than 1 billion additional COVID-19 vaccines for the world, starting, effectively, now.<br>&nbsp;<br>Looking ahead to tomorrow, I wanted to give some context and subtext.&nbsp; We are obviously not looking to make China the overriding issue while we&#8217;re in Europe.&nbsp; It isn’t the focus or the headline of many of the deliverables my colleague will go through in a minute.<br>&nbsp;<br>But many of them also happen to be in service of positioning the United States and our partners to better compete with China, just as is the case with some of our most important domestic steps, like those concerning getting our economy back in line and getting our arms around the pandemic &#8212; steps that have allowed the United States to reengage with the world from a position of strength.<br>&nbsp;<br>This is not about making countries choose between us and China; this is about offering an affirmative, alternative vision and approach that they would want to choose.&nbsp; So, what we are promoting is a confident, positive agenda focused around rallying other countries that share our values on the issues that matter most.<br>&nbsp;<br>What does that mean?&nbsp; On vaccines: As we’ve said, we and our G7 partners are providing more than a billion additional COVID-19 vaccine doses for the world, of which the U.S. will contribute half a billion doses to the developing world.&nbsp; For us, this is about saving lives and ending the pandemic.&nbsp; This is not about coercion or transactional political or economic favors.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>On infrastructure, we’ll be announcing a bold, new global infrastructure initiative with our G7 partners that will be values-driven, transparent, and sustainable.&nbsp; There is, by some estimates, a $40 trillion infrastructure gap in parts of the world that this would be intended to help other countries fill.&nbsp; My colleague will be saying more about this in a moment, but we believe that it stands in stark contrast to the way that some other countries have handled efforts around infrastructure.<br>&nbsp;<br>At NATO, which will be next on the President&#8217;s agenda after the G7 wraps up &#8212; this will be the first time that the NATO countries will be addressing the security challenge from China directly in a communiqué.<br>&nbsp;<br>At the EU Summit, which will also take place in Brussels, we will be addressing the trade and technology and other challenges in the U.S.-EU relationship and also the opportunities those issues present so that we can focus on writing the rules of the road on these issues together as democracies, and not leave that work to the autocracies of the world.<br>&nbsp;<br>So we are doing the careful hard work of diplomacy, of rallying our friends and allies.&nbsp; We’re not looking to simply score a bunch of rhetorical points on China.&nbsp; And this is how we believe our endeavors will be most successful.<br>&nbsp;<br>And the contrast between approach and China&#8217;s, on these and other issues, is really &#8212; should speak for itself.&nbsp; As the President likes to say, &#8220;It&#8217;s never a good bet to bet against America,&#8221; and I think that we are proving that point already in the context of G7 and the other meetings I described.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So with that, I will turn it over to my colleague to talk about tomorrow&#8217;s G7 session.<br>&nbsp;<br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Yeah, thanks.&nbsp; Can everybody hear me?&nbsp; Just to do a soundcheck.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Yes, go ahead.<br>&nbsp;<br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Okay, great.&nbsp; So as [senior administration official] mentioned, tomorrow&#8217;s morning session at the G7 will be on China.&nbsp; I want to give you a heads up on two specific areas of focus: one, a new G7 infrastructure partnership called &#8220;Build Back Better for the World&#8221;; and, second, to give you an update on what we&#8217;re saying and what we&#8217;re doing about forced labor.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So, first, on the infrastructure initiative, the United States and many of our partners and friends around the world have long been skeptical about China&#8217;s Belt and Road Initiative.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve seen the Chinese government demonstrate a lack of transparency, poor environmental and labor standards, and a course of approach that&#8217;s left many countries worse off.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>But until now, we haven&#8217;t offered a positive alternative that reflects our values, our standards, and our way of doing business.&nbsp; So, tomorrow, we&#8217;ll be announcing &#8220;Build Back Better for the World,&#8221; an ambitious, new global infrastructure initiative with our G7 partners that won&#8217;t just be an alternative to the BRI, but we believe will beat the BRI by offering a higher-quality choice.&nbsp; And we&#8217;ll offer that choice of self-confidence about our model that reflects our shared values.<br>&nbsp;<br>So, as we come together on this partnership, our G7 partners have agreed that our real purpose here is to demonstrate that democracies and open societies can come together and deliver a positive choice to meet some of the biggest challenges of our time, not just for our people, but for people all over the world.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And let&#8217;s be clear, as [senior administration official] alluded to: The needs in the developing world for high-quality infrastructure &#8212; whether it&#8217;s physical infrastructure, digital infrastructure, health infrastructure, or a way to deal with gender disparities &#8212; are large and growing, and made especially worse after the pandemic.<br>&nbsp;<br>The World Bank estimates there&#8217;s a cumulative $40 trillion of infrastructure needs in the developing world through 2035.&nbsp; And &#8220;Build Back Better for the World,&#8221; or B3W, is an affirmative way to meet that need while meeting the highest labor and environmental standards, providing transparency, and mobilizing the private sector to invest with us.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>I&#8217;ll be happy to say more if you have questions.&nbsp; But let me turn now to forced labor.&nbsp; And so, President Biden in tomorrow&#8217;s session will also be pressing his fellow leaders for concrete action on forced labor to make clear to the world that we believe these practices are an affront to human dignity and an egregious example of China&#8217;s unfair economic competition.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>I&#8217;m not going to get ahead of the discussions tomorrow, but I can share a little bit more about the U.S. perspective and how we view the issue.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So, when we think of forced labor &#8212; and, look, we &#8212; it&#8217;s an expression of our shared values to make clear what we won&#8217;t tolerate as the United States and as a G7.&nbsp; So we think it&#8217;s critical to call out the use of forced labor in Xinjiang and to take concrete actions to ensure that global supply chains are free from the use of forced labor.<br>&nbsp;<br>And the point is to send a wakeup call that the G7 is serious about defending human rights and that we need to work together to eradicate forced labor from our products.<br>&nbsp;<br>Let me pause there.<br>&nbsp;<br>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; Thank you so much.&nbsp; So now we’ve got some time for some Q&amp;A, so if you have a question, please use the “raise hand” function on the Zoom interface, and we’ll try to get through as many questions as we can.&nbsp; So, again, please use the “raise hand” function on the Zoom interface, and we’ll call on as much as we have time for.</p>



<p>Let’s first go to Anne Gearan of The Washington Post.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, could you talk a little bit more about the China piece of this and describe for us what the other G7 countries, to the best of your knowledge, are willing to do in terms of taking on China more frontally?&nbsp; Obviously, a lot of these other countries have different trading relationships and, in some cases, far deeper trading relationships than even the United States.&nbsp; What are they willing to do, and how confident can you be that, in this context, they’re going to be with you in confronting China?<br>&nbsp;<br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Thanks, Anne.&nbsp; So, I mean, I guess, as I said, this is not just about confronting or taking on China.&nbsp; This is about providing an affirmative, positive, alternative vision for the world than that that is presented by China and, in some similar ways but also in some different ways, Russia.<br>&nbsp;<br>You know, the President talks often about this contest of democracies and autocracies.&nbsp; And for him, that is not an abstract question of political science or even purely a moral or values-based question &#8212; although I think he does have strong feelings about the values element of democracy.&nbsp; It is actually, first and foremost, about whether the democratic system can continue to deliver for its own people, for the people of our partner democracies, and for the citizens of the world.<br>&nbsp;<br>And so what this G7 meeting is, first and foremost, about is proving that point: that democracies &#8212; the leading democracies &#8212; when they come together, can deliver.&nbsp; I think we’re seeing that in the context of the vaccines announcement.&nbsp; We’re going to see that in the context of the infrastructure announcement that we’ve described, and some of the other steps they’re going to be taking during the course of this week.<br>&nbsp;<br>But, in many ways, that’s going to be the most important work.&nbsp; It’s not a confrontation, but basically a presentation of a model that we believe, to this day, remains more appealing.&nbsp; There are other contexts in which, you know, we will talk about taking China on more directly, but this meeting is really focused on an affirmative vision.<br>&nbsp;<br>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Next, we’ll go to Andrea Mitchell with MSNBC.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you all so much.&nbsp; Regarding Vladimir Putin, as you head into Geneva &#8212; NATO first, of course; the G7; and then to Geneva &#8212; has his crackdown on Navalny’s operation, calling them “extremists,” indicated to you that having a stable and predictable relationship with Vladimir Putin, as the President had said (inaudible) he wants to, is going to be very difficult to achieve?&nbsp; And does that change your posture going into this summit?&nbsp; Thank you.<br>&nbsp;<br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Thanks, Andrea.&nbsp; You know, we’re under no illusions that this is going to be an easy relationship; it is going to be an extremely challenging relationship.&nbsp; And I think we’ve been quite clear about that.</p>



<p>And the President has been very clear in two phone calls now with President Putin that, perhaps unlike some of his predecessors, he is not going to simply elide or gloss over the differences that we have; he’s going to take them on with candor and directly.&nbsp; And that where Russia crosses lines that we consider to be unacceptable, we will impose costs on Russia for doing that.<br>&nbsp;<br>You know, he has said that directly to the Russian president, and then he has lived by that in some of the steps that we’ve rolled out, including with regard to the poisoning of Aleksey Navalny.<br>&nbsp;<br>So, I think that &#8212; without getting ahead of the conversation that has yet to take place between the two leaders &#8212; I think the conversation that &#8212; that the meeting in Geneva will be held in a very similar vein to what I’ve just described.<br>&nbsp;<br>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Next, we’ll go to Steve Holland with Reuters.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is actually Andrew Restuccia with the Wall Street Journal.&nbsp; We’re all sitting together by the pool listening to the call on speaker.&nbsp; But, I just wanted to ask if you would &#8212; if you expect, in the G7 communiqué, to name China specifically, or if it will be sort of a more subtle reference to China?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And then, separately, how much do you expect the G7 to put toward this global infrastructure proposal?&nbsp; Is there an overall number?&nbsp; And how far will it go to closing this $40 trillion infrastructure gap?&nbsp; Thanks.<br>&nbsp;<br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Yeah, do you want the first, and I can take the second?<br>&nbsp;<br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; I think you probably should take both, given that you&#8217;re &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Sure.<br>&nbsp;<br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; &#8212; directly involved in this.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Yeah, so, you know, we&#8217;re in the middle of these negotiations.&nbsp; The communiqué doesn&#8217;t actually get finalized until Sunday.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>But suffice it to say that China has been an animating topic throughout these discussions, and, you know &#8212; and it&#8217;s very much &#8212; as [senior administration official] described, the conversation is very much about this contest that President Biden speaks of between those who think that autocracy is the best path forward and those, like us, who understand that democracies and our shared values provide the best path for delivering for our people and also meeting the biggest challenges in the world.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So, the communiqué reflects those conversations as it&#8217;s taking shape.&nbsp; And, look, we&#8217;re pushing for being specific on areas like Xinjiang, where forced labor is taking place and where we have to express our values as a G7.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>It&#8217;s too early to say what will end up in the final.&nbsp; But certainly that&#8217;s our position, and that&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve been advocating for.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Great.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; On the second question, in terms of the size &#8212; the potential size of this infrastructure initiative: Let me just say that, in addition to the billions of dollars which the U.S. already mobilizes in overseas infrastructure financing through our bilateral tools and also our multilateral institutions, our plan is to work with Congress to augment our development finance toolkit with the hope that &#8212; together with G7 partners, the private sector, and other stakeholders &#8212; we’ll soon be collectively catalyzing hundreds of billions of dollars in infrastructure investment for low- and middle-income countries that need it.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So, that&#8217;s a credible scale.&nbsp; There&#8217;s no real way to estimate how large some of the other large &#8212; some of the other major infrastructure programs are in the world, including the BRI, that don&#8217;t have the same degree of transparency.&nbsp; But we&#8217;re aiming for an ambitious and credible scale.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Next, we&#8217;ll go to David Sanger with the New York Times.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you for doing this.&nbsp; Two questions related to the next couple of days.&nbsp; All of you and President Biden have made it pretty clear that you want to put together some rules of the road, or guardrails, on cyber, similar to what some of the summits have done in the past in other areas &#8212; terrorism, nuclear, and so forth.&nbsp; Can you tell us how that&#8217;s going to play out at G7 and NATO?&nbsp; And then, if there are any specific proposals for Mr. Putin?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And we hear there have been some developments in the effort about whether or not the President and Mr. Putin will be speaking publicly together in any form in Geneva, if you could give us an update on that.<br>&nbsp;<br>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Did we lose you, [senior administration official]?<br>&nbsp;<br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Sorry.&nbsp; Sorry.&nbsp; I muted myself.&nbsp; I&#8217;m sorry about that.&nbsp; So, David, on cyber, I think you&#8217;re going to see that this is featured prominently in every single one of the key meetings on this overseas trip.&nbsp; It&#8217;s going to be featured prominently in the G7 conversations.&nbsp; We can say more about that if you want.&nbsp; I think in the EU Summit and at the NATO Summit, you&#8217;re going to see a discussion around the recent spate of ransomware attacks and the threats to critical infrastructure.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And certainly, in the conversation with President Putin, you can expect &#8212; as it has been raised in the past in the conversations between the two leaders &#8212; for the President to raise it very directly and make clear our expectations of the government of Russia to address the threat that is emanating from its territory.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Whether these ransomware attackers are state actors or not, they are present on Russian soil, in many cases, and we believe it’s the responsibility of the Russian government to address that, as it would be for any state that has criminals acting inside its territory.<br>&nbsp;<br>And so that will be made very clear to President Putin.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t want to get ahead of outcomes or the conversation in any more detail than that.<br>&nbsp;<br>You asked also about the public dimension of that meeting, and I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ve got more to say about that at this point, but I know that there&#8217;s a lot of interest in it, and I expect we&#8217;ll have more to say about that soon.<br>&nbsp;<br>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Thanks so much.<br>&nbsp;<br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; And just a &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Go ahead.<br>&nbsp;<br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Just to pick up on [senior administration official]’s comment about ransomware and the discussion about cyber within the G7 context: And I would just say &#8212; I mean, there&#8217;s uniform recognition that ransomware and the abuse of virtual currencies is an urgent threat, it’s an escalating threat.&nbsp; And there&#8217;s been a productive discussion, I would say, in terms of how we can share information to support prosecutions, how we can hold criminal networks to account, and also how we can modernize our cyber defenses.<br>&nbsp;<br>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Thanks so much.&nbsp; I think we, unfortunately, have time for one last question, so let&#8217;s go to Betsy Klein with CNN.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, this is Kaitlan Collins.&nbsp; Just to follow up on David&#8217;s question: When Biden&#8217;s predecessor met with Putin, no staff was in the room, with the exception of interpreters.&nbsp; So, can you confirm who from the U.S. side will be in the room when they meet next week?<br>&nbsp;<br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; So, I think the answer to that is: We can&#8217;t yet.&nbsp; You know, I suspect that the meeting will take place with some multiple formats &#8212; maybe some small or maybe some larger &#8212; but we do not have the information to confirm yet exactly who is going to be in the meeting.&nbsp; But we know, as I said, that there&#8217;s a lot of interest in that question, and I expect we&#8217;ll have more to say about it soon.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you at least confirm that there will be staff in the room beyond just translators?<br>&nbsp;<br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; I mean, again, I&#8217;m not going to confirm any of the format information.&nbsp; I think, well before the summit, you will hear more from us on this.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Alrighty.&nbsp; Thanks so much, everyone, for joining us this evening.&nbsp; Again, this call is on background attributable to “senior administration officials,” embargoed until 7:00 a.m. British Summer Time, tomorrow, June 12th.&nbsp; We&#8217;ll talk to you all again very soon.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>As the President said when recognizing the tragic injustice of the Tulsa race massacre, the “sacred right [to vote] is under assault with an incredible intensity,” in a manner that is “simply un-American” but sadly, not unprecedented. And he called for a redoubling of efforts to expand voting rights and overcome the surge in efforts to undermine the right to vote of so many Americans through anti-voter laws that are motivated by a dangerous lie – a lie that motivated the unprecedented assault on our Capitol on January 6th, that cost the lives of brave law enforcement officers, and that has been disproven by over 80 federal judges appointed by Presidents of both parties and bipartisan election official across the country.<br><br>Plain and simple, these voter suppression laws are meant to attack Americans’ constitutional rights &#8212; especially people of color &#8212; and that is absolutely unacceptable to the President. He ran to restore the soul of America, and to address the four principal crises facing our nation – one of which is racial justice.</p>



<p>In office, the President has taken unprecedented action to advance voting rights and defend this sacred right. And he recently named Vice President Harris to take charge of a new, intensified campaign on this issue, signifying its vital importance to this administration.</p>



<p>Voting rights have been at the core of his agenda for his entire time in public life. In the Senate he was indispensable to expanding access to the franchise, securing a 25-year extension of the Voting Rights Act – when Strom Thurmond chaired the Judiciary Committee. And in the Senate, Vice President Harris was a leader on voting rights legislation and built a very strong record on the issue as Attorney General of California. &nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to today’s major announcements by Attorney General Garland – including that the Department of Justice will within 30 days double the staff of its Civil Rights Division for protecting the right to vote &#8212; here are the actions the administration has taken on voting rights since taking office:</p>



<ul><li>On the anniversary of the brutal attacks on civil rights protesters crossing the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama in 1965, the President signed an historic executive order which took far-reaching actions to expand voting access and protect the freedom to vote using every executive authority available to make voting easier, more accessible, and fairer.<br></li><li>This order directed federal agencies, in a whole-of-government effort, to expand access to voter registration and election information; put themselves in the best position to assist states under the National Voter Registration Act; improve and modernize Vote.gov; increase federal employees’ access to voting; analyze barriers to voting for people with disabilities; increase voting access for active duty military and other overseas voters; and establish a Native American voting rights steering group.<br></li><li>The President also nominated and won hard-fought confirmation for some of the most qualified civil rights leaders to ever have senior posts at the Department of Justice, including Vanita Gupta as the first woman of color to serve as the Associate Attorney General and Kristen Clarke as the first Black woman to lead the DOJ’s Civil Rights Division. And the President is taking steps to ensure DOJ the resources needed to enforce existing laws.<br></li><li>The President and Vice President are fighting for legislation<s>,</s>. That includes the For the People Act, which would set basic national standards for fair voting access in federal elections, and help ensure the ethical conduct of those elected to office.&nbsp; And it includes the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, which would stop racial discrimination in our elections before that discrimination has the chance to take effect.&nbsp;<br></li><li>When he became the first president to travel to Tulsa to mark the history of the terrible massacre on Black Wall Street, he named Vice President Harris to lead a new, specific effort to fight for voting rights. Her strategy is to use the bully pulpit to build additional public support on top of the bipartisan majorities that already back our voting rights agenda. She’s using the power of the White House to convene key stakeholders, and will be hosting several next week. And she’ll continue to fight for our key bills.</li></ul>

<p>In the midst of a revolution, less than a year after declaring our independence, the Congress consecrated what would become an enduring emblem of American unity by adopting a national flag on June 14, 1777.</p>



<p>In the 244 years since, the United States has grown and changed across the generations &#8212; and our flag has changed in turn.&nbsp; The blue field of stars has been enlarged as our Union has gained in size and strength.&nbsp; The 13 stripes, symbolizing the 13 original States, have held as constant as the bedrock values upon which our Nation was first conceived &#8212; the very same values we still cherish, and still reach for, today.</p>



<p>Since adoption of the Stars and Stripes, Americans &#8212; and people around the world &#8212; have continuously looked to our flag as a symbol of unity and liberty. &nbsp;Our flag has sailed around the globe, and journeyed to the Moon and, now, to Mars.&nbsp; It has flown on fields of battle, and marks the resting places of those who have given what President Lincoln called &#8220;the last full measure of devotion&#8221; for our country. &nbsp;Its prominence at civic landmarks and seats of public authority communicates the promise of democracy &#8212; that under this flag, the rule of law is supreme and the people reign. &nbsp;As we continue the sacred work of building a more perfect Union together, let our flag serve as a&nbsp;reminder to us, and to the world, that America stands for and&nbsp;strives for the promise of freedom, justice, and equality for&nbsp;all.</p>



<p>To commemorate the adoption of our flag, the Congress, by joint resolution approved August 3, 1949, as amended (63 Stat. 492), designated June 14 of each year as &#8220;Flag Day&#8221; and requested that the President issue an annual proclamation calling for its observance and for the display of the flag of the United States on all Federal Government buildings.&nbsp; The Congress also requested, by joint resolution approved June 9, 1966, as amended (80 Stat. 194), that the President issue annually a proclamation designating the week in which June 14 occurs as &#8220;National Flag Week&#8221; and calling upon all citizens of the United States to display the flag during that week.</p>



<p>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim June 14, 2021, as Flag Day, and the week starting June 13, 2021, as National Flag Week.&nbsp; I direct the appropriate officials to display the flag on&nbsp;all Federal Government buildings during this week, and I urge all Americans to observe Flag Day and National Flag Week by displaying the flag.&nbsp; I encourage the people of the United&nbsp;States to observe with pride and all due ceremony those days from Flag Day through Independence Day, set aside by the Congress (89 Stat. 211), as a time to honor the American spirit, to celebrate our history and the foundational values we strive to uphold, and to publicly recite the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America.</p>



<p>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eleventh day of June, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-fifth.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-right"><br>                                 JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p><strong>Today, President Biden welcomed the historic commitment of the leaders of the G7 and guest countries to provide more than 1 billion additional COVID-19 vaccines for the world, starting this summer, of which the United States will contribute half a billion doses.</strong><br><br>This commitment forms the basis of a comprehensive set of G7+ actions towards ending this global pandemic in 2022. The G7+ action plan that will be agreed to by leaders in Cornwall includes vaccinating the world’s most vulnerable, providing emergency supplies, bolstering world-wide economic recovery, and positioning the international community to prepare for, prevent, detect, and respond to future biological catastrophes.&nbsp;<br><br>The United States will lead the G7+ in a global COVID-19 vaccination campaign, providing 500 million safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines for the world&nbsp;through COVAX, with delivery starting in&nbsp;August&nbsp;2021. This&nbsp;donation, which President Biden announced yesterday,&nbsp;is the largest single donation of vaccines in history and comprises half of the G7+ commitment to provide an additional 1 billion safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine doses over the next 12 months, especially to the world’s most vulnerable.<br><br>In addition,&nbsp;we are taking concrete&nbsp;and tangible steps to meet the ambition of the G7+ and drive action to end this pandemic and prevent the next.&nbsp;We call on other countries and private sector partners to join us.&nbsp;<br><br>To end the global&nbsp;COVID-19&nbsp;pandemic, the United States and the G7+ will:</p>



<ul><li><strong><u>Accelerate Vaccination of the World’s Most Vulnerable</u></strong><br><strong>We are fully committed to working towards the ambitious goal of ending the pandemic. </strong>Yesterday’s announcement of half a billion new vaccine doses comes on top of both the at least 80 million vaccine doses previously announced by President Biden and the $2 billion in funding which the United States has previously provided to Gavi to support COVAX. We call on countries to donate additional doses of safe and effective vaccines, strengthen vaccine readiness, and work with private sector partners to vaccinate the world. <br> </li><li><strong><u>Support Last Mile Vaccination and Getting Shots into Arms</u></strong><br>The Biden-Harris Administration will be providing hundreds of millions in support for programs that provide assistance to help countries and health systems prepare for vaccination around the world, including in Latin America, Asia, and Africa. That assistance comes on top of longstanding U.S. support for countries and communities around the world for immunization and strengthening health systems. <br> </li><li><strong><u>Save Lives Now with PPE and Emergency Medical Supplies</u></strong><br>The Biden-Harris Administration is investing in efforts to help fragile countries with their emergency response, including lifesaving medical and other supplies to tackle COVID-19 surges while strengthening their health systems, building capacity to manage surges, and preventing disease spread. We must expand our emergency responses, including by delivering lifesaving medical supplies, oxygen, diagnostics, therapeutics, and PPE. We are providing emergency assistance in 2021 to regions that need it most, including sending multiple flights and more than $100 million in health assistance to India, and supporting responses in South Asia and Latin America as countries experience surges in COVID-19 cases. <br><br>Through the $11.5 billion provided in the American Rescue Plan (ARP) for the global COVID-19 response, we will continue to strengthen our global response to and recovery from COVID-19, including by expanding investments in lifesaving medical supplies, including oxygen, diagnostics, therapeutics, and PPE. We urge the World Bank Group and the other Multilateral Development Banks to increase the speed of their financial support to the response.<br> </li><li><strong><u>Boosting Global Supply and Supporting Surge Capacity</u></strong><br>We must increase our investments in local production capacity for safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines, therapeutics, raw materials, diagnostics, and medical supplies. We will help develop and sustain a global vaccine supply network for this pandemic and the next.<br><br>The Biden-Harris Administration is investing, through the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC), in local production capacity for safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines, which will support at least 1 billion vaccine doses by the end of 2022. This includes our efforts through the Quad Vaccine Partnership of the United States, India, Japan, and Australia, and with peer Development Finance Institutions including the IFC, Proparco, and DEG to support vaccine manufacturing in Africa – for Africa. We strongly support the aim of developing a regional network of surge capacity to produce medical countermeasures, PPE, and other lifesaving treatments and supplies.</li></ul>



<p>We recognize that the above immediate actions to end the pandemic contribute to our collective longer-term preparedness. We are committed to developing sustainable surge capacity in every region to scale up medical countermeasures and supply production on a “no regrets” basis at the first sign of a health crisis.</p>



<p>Simultaneously, we will&nbsp;work&nbsp;expeditiously to&nbsp;advance global health security to prevent future biological catastrophes:</p>



<ul><li><strong><u>Transform Disease Surveillance and Early Warning</u></strong><br>We must substantially strengthen the rapid detection of infectious disease threats. We will support the establishment of a coordinated global surveillance network to improve disease forecasting and surveillance, enable swift detection of pathogens, and translate early detection into action. We commit to accelerate development, production, and deployment of safe and effective countermeasures within 100 days.<br><br>The Biden-Harris Administration is investing $500 million from the ARP to modernize public health data and infrastructure including establishing a new Center for Epidemic Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which will help lead a new global pandemic early warning network. The American Jobs Plan (AJP) includes $30 billion toward building U.S. pandemic readiness, including by accelerating our ability to develop, produce, and deploy safe and effective countermeasures within 100 days. <br> </li><li><strong><u>Advance Global Health Security</u></strong><br>We must work with other countries and private sector partners to reach agreement by the 2021 UN General Assembly on the creation of a catalytic global health security financing mechanism and for its sustainable funding. We also commit to establishing the needed governance, oversight, accountability and transparency for future health security threats. The Biden-Harris Administration is spearheading an effort, building a coalition of public and private partners around the world, to come to consensus and establish and sustainably fund a global health security financing mechanism in 2021. We have also requested at least $250 million through the President’s Fiscal Year 2022 Budget Request to support seed funding for this mechanism this year. We look forward to progress before this year’s United Nations General Assembly, including consensus on the governance and transparency required for future health emergencies. In this regard, the Biden-Harris Administration welcomes the Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response (IPPPR) recommendation to establish a Global Health Threats Council at the UN. </li></ul>



<p>And we will go further to Build Back Better:</p>



<ul><li><strong><u>Build Resilience to Recover</u></strong><br>We will not stop with ending the pandemic:&nbsp;we&nbsp;must also&nbsp;invest in the global recovery from COVID-19.&nbsp;The Biden-Harris&nbsp;Administration strongly supports assisting&nbsp;countries&nbsp;in&nbsp;recovering&nbsp;from the pandemic’s&nbsp;aftershocks.&nbsp;We&nbsp;seek to&nbsp;reorient our development finance tools to&nbsp;strengthen health systems,&nbsp;catalyze infrastructure investment&nbsp;in&nbsp;for&nbsp;low-and middle-income countries&nbsp;and&nbsp;reverse the&nbsp;secondary impacts&nbsp;that&nbsp;have sent millions into poverty and hunger, disrupting and destabilizing education, political, economic, and social systems. We&nbsp;strongly support the effort&nbsp;to recycle&nbsp;Special Drawing Rights&nbsp;(SDRs) to further support health needs.&nbsp;We will&nbsp;also&nbsp;maintain our strong commitment to global education and strengthening the resiliency of food systems, including by mitigating the disproportionate disruptions experienced by women and girls.</li></ul>



<p>The United States remains committed to saving lives and ending the COVID-19 pandemic now. We look forward to the adoption of the G7+ action plan this weekend. We call on other countries and private sector partners to support this ambition.</p>

<p>Yesterday, as part of her ongoing engagement with stakeholders across the country, Deputy National Security Advisor for Cyber and Emerging Technology Anne Neuberger met with the bipartisan National Association of Attorneys General (NAAG) to speak to the cybersecurity challenges facing the nation, including the threat from ransomware. Neuberger stressed the important role state and local governments play in the nation’s cybersecurity, and emphasized the essential role attorneys general play in legal actions aimed at protecting state networks, ensuring consumer privacy, and prosecuting cybercrimes. She listened to the Attorneys General on the cyber challenges their states are facing, and briefed them on the measures that the public and private sector can immediately take to bolster cyber defenses.</p>



<p>Neuberger outlined the measures the Biden Administration has already taken to modernize cyber defenses, including the recent “Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity” Executive Order and the Administration’s ongoing efforts to partner with the public and private sectors to strengthen critical infrastructure cyber defenses. She spoke about the recent public-private Cybersecurity Industrial Control Systems Initiative and its pilot program to strengthen cyber resilience in the electric sector, noting the electric sector pilot will soon be followed by similar initiatives to strengthen the cyber resilience of other critical sectors like pipelines, water, and chemicals. Neuberger described the Biden Administration’s ransomware strategy which includes four lines of effort: disruption of ransomware infrastructure and actors by working closely with the private sector; international cooperation to hold countries who harbor ransom actors accountable; expanding cryptocurrency analysis to find and pursue criminal transactions; and reviewing the USG’s ransomware payment policies and approaches. She also underscored the President’s commitment to modernizing existing infrastructure while simultaneously investing in the infrastructure of the future.</p>



<p>In a reference to her <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Memo-What-We-Urge-You-To-Do-To-Protect-Against-The-Threat-of-Ransomware.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">open letter</a> to the private sector, Neuberger reiterated the need for private and public sector partnership to effectively guard against ransomware, recalling that much of U.S. critical infrastructure is owned and operated by the private sector. She reiterated her call to action that corporate leaders implement the discrete, high-impact cybersecurity measures contained in her open letter, and those referenced in the President’s Executive Order. Investing in cybersecurity is a far better investment for our economy and for companies than paying the funds in ransom.</p>

<p>President Biden’s American Rescue Plan included historic investments to support low- and middle-income parents – who have long faced increasing financial strain, worsened by the pandemic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, the Biden-Harris administration is announcing Child Tax Credit Awareness Day on Monday, June 21st to ensure parents know about the American Rescue Plan’s historic expansion of the Child Tax Credit and how it will benefit their families. Critically, as part of Child Tax Credit Awareness Day, the administration will encourage elected officials, organizations that fight for children, and faith-based organizations, to help low-income families—who may have such low-incomes that they are not required to file taxes—to use a new, easy Child Tax Credit sign-up tool to help give their children a lifeline out of poverty. And, the administration is releasing guidance for three elements of the American Rescue Plan that will support families, including: $15 billion for the <a href="https://www.acf.hhs.gov/occ/policy-guidance/ccdf-acf-im-2021-03">Child Care and Development Block Grant</a>, an historic expansion of the <a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/child-and-dependent-care-tax-credit-faqs">Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit</a>, and six months of extended support for small and midsize employers offering paid sick and family leave in response to the pandemic through the <a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/tax-credits-for-paid-leave-under-the-american-rescue-plan-act-of-2021-for-leave-after-march-31-2021">Paid Leave Tax Credit</a>.</p>



<p>These measures will help parents by helping them with the costs of raising children – measures that experts project could contribute to cutting child poverty in half. They will also help defray the costs of child care, provide more child care options, and support return to work for those who have lost their jobs or income &#8212; especially mothers. And, they will do all of this while investing in the future of the nation’s children.</p>



<p>While the American Rescue Plan is providing historic investments to confront the effects of the pandemic and help provide immediate relief from COVID-19, President Biden is calling to extend historic tax relief for working families and increase high quality child care and available paid family and medical leave through the American Families Plan and American Jobs plan.</p>



<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Families need support to power an equitable economic recovery and to support healthy development for children who most need it</span><br></strong><br>We are experiencing a record-setting economic recovery, with historic growth in employment and wages. And, in the first four months of the Biden administration, more than 2 million jobs were created—an average of 540,000 jobs a month. But, our economy remains about 7.6 million jobs below its pre-pandemic level, and labor force participation remains more than 1 percentage point below its pre-pandemic level. Women were also particularly hard hit by the pandemic. More than one-half of the lost jobs—nearly 4.2 million—were once held by women, and 1.8 million women remain out of the labor force.</p>



<p>And, the pandemic has exacerbated many families’ distress. According to the <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/poverty-and-inequality/tracking-the-covid-19-recessions-effects-on-food-housing-and#_ftnref8">latest U.S. Census Pulse survey in May,</a> one third of all adults with children are struggling to pay their usual expenses like food, rent, health care, and transportation. One in eight adults living with children report their household doesn’t have enough food to eat. One in five renters living with children reported that they are not caught up on rent. Black and brown families and women are disproportionately feeling the strain of the pandemic. And, financial hardship has <a href="/Users/KGLandrieu/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/Content.Outlook/FWH13A5H/•%09Extends%20the%20Child%20Tax%20Credit%20in%20the%20American%20Rescue%20Plan,%20which%20helps%20families%20raising%20children%20make%20ends%20meet">long-term consequences </a>for the healthy development of children.</p>



<p>Families need economic relief. And, many parents need support to be able to return to work or continue working so they can provide economic security for their families.</p>



<p>In part, lack of high-quality, affordable child care can make it logistically difficult for parents to work. Indeed, many parents—particularly mothers—<a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/early-childhood/reports/2019/03/28/467488/child-care-crisis-keeping-women-workforce/">report</a>&nbsp;that they work fewer hours than they would prefer or need to in order to care for their young children. For some parents there is no choice but to find outside care if they want or need to work: as found in a recent&nbsp;<a href="https://bfi.uchicago.edu/wp-content/uploads/BFI_WP_202046.pdf">analysis</a>, one in five workers live in households with a child under 14, but do not live with a non-working adult who could potentially serve as a caregiver. And, this problem is most acute for single mothers.</p>



<p>According to the latest U.S. Census Pulse Survey in May, about 7.6 million adults had someone in their household who took paid or unpaid leave, left their job, lost their job, or did not look for a job in the last month because child care arrangements remain disrupted due to the pandemic—three in four of whom were women and half of whom were women of color. Another 1.2 million women continued to work-from-home while they or another family member cares for their children. &nbsp;</p>



<p>And, the pandemic laid bare the fact that the majority of&nbsp; low-wage workers have <a href="https://www.bls.gov/ncs/ebs/benefits/2020/employee-benefits-in-the-united-states-march-2020.pdf">no access</a> to paid sick leave or paid family and medical leave. Ninety-five percent of low-wage workers have no access to paid family and medical leave and 69 percent have no access to paid sick leave. This meant workers were left with few options to protect their own and their families’ health and well-being at the beginning of COVID. Paid leave is a critical policy for ensuring workers stay connected to the jobs when a health need or crisis arises, and thereby, not lose needed income or a job.</p>



<p>The American Rescue Plan is taking several steps to support family economic security and the healthy development of children.</p>



<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Help is Here: Child Tax Credit Awareness Day</span><br></strong><br>The American Rescue Plan delivered major tax relief for working families with children through a historic expansion of the Child Tax Credit. In 2021, for most families, the Child Tax Credit is increased to $3,000 for each child between 6 and 17 years old and to $3,600 for each child under age 6. For example, a married couple making less than $150,000 with two children under age 6 will be eligible for a Child Tax Credit of $7,200 in 2021–at least $3,200 more than they would have received prior to the American Rescue Plan.</p>



<p>While tax relief is typically available only when you file your taxes, thanks to the American Rescue Plan, Child Tax Credit payments will be provided monthly for the first time ever, beginning in July. This means needed relief will reach families sooner, and they can count on it each month to help make ends meet. To help with the costs of raising children, families will begin to receive monthly payments of up to $250 for each child 6 to 17 years old and $300 for each child under age 6. Under the American Rescue Plan, the Child Tax Credit will be fully refundable, meaning that if a family’s income tax bill is less than the amount of their Child Tax Credit, they will get a payment for the difference. This will ensure for the first time that even the most hard-pressed families will get at least as much support as more affluent families.</p>



<p>The IRS estimates that roughly 39 million households — covering almost 90 percent of children in the United States — are slated to begin receiving monthly payments without any further action required. Other eligible families— those who have not yet filed taxes in 2019 or 2020 and who did not sign-up for Economic Impact Payments like the $1,400 rescue payments included in the American Rescue Plan—can still sign-up to receive monthly Child Tax Credit payments beginning this summer. Experts project that the expanded Child Tax Credit could potentially help lift one-half of all children out of poverty if all eligible families sign-up to receive the monthly payments.</p>



<p>Today, the Biden-Harris administration is announcing that Monday, June 21st will be Child Tax Credit Awareness Day—a day of action to get the word out far and wide on the upcoming monthly payments that will benefit nearly all families. It is also important that we extend these benefits beyond 2021 as the President has proposed in his American Families Plan. The administration will be calling on elected officials, faith-based groups, organizations that fight for children and families, and other partners to join us on June 21st to raise awareness that help is on the way.</p>



<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Child Care Development Block Grant Guidance</span><br></strong><br>The Biden Administration has provided states with unprecedented funding for expansions and improvements for child care, providing states with a tremendous opportunity to invest in early care and learning. The American Rescue Plan’s $39 billion investment in child care is historic on its own, and the administration has gone further to encourage state and local governments to finance quality child care options for parents and increase wages for the early childhood workforce. The Administration of Children and Families released <a href="https://www.acf.hhs.gov/occ/policy-guidance/ccdf-acf-im-2021-03">guidance </a>to States, Territories, and Tribes for the American Rescue Plan’s $15 billion in discretionary Child Care and Development Block Grants (CCDBG). The guidance strongly recommends that lead agencies focus resources on investing in child care in ways that strengthen the child care system and ensure that families have equal access to quality, affordable child care to support them during and after the pandemic. To do that, it:</p>



<ul><li>Strongly recommends that lead agencies prioritize increasing provider payment rates and workforce compensation so that child care providers can retain a skilled workforce and deliver higher-quality care to children receiving subsidies.<ul><li>While the economy has added <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CES6562440001">45,000</a> child care jobs since January, more than <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CES6562440001">one in eight </a>child care jobs have yet to return since the start of the pandemic. And, because of the lack of resources in the child care industry, annual turnover rates for child care workers were high even before the pandemic. The inability of providers to recruit and retain a high-quality workforce hinders access to care in many communities. And, for those who can access care, high turnover often disrupts the stable relationships between children and providers that are important to child development and wellbeing. The <a href="https://daneshyari.com/article/preview/353687.pdf">quality of the classroom environment</a> and interactions between teachers and students are linked to children’s school readiness skills, and <a href="https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED477480.pdf">higher compensation</a> for the child care workforce is associated with better quality literacy environments. But, <a href="https://cscce.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/ReportFINAL.pdf">nearly half</a> of child care workers – who are disproportionately women of color &#8212; rely on public income supports. Child care workers experiencing <a href="https://cscce.berkeley.edu/educator-work-environments-are-childrens-learning-environments-how-and-why-they-should-be-improved/">economic stress</a> have a more difficult time fully engaging with children and offering a quality learning experience.</li><li>Using these funds to increase payment rates to providers and workers’ compensation will improve care quality, give parents a wider range of options from which to choose, boost wages for a chronically underpaid workforce, and better support the small businesses that comprise the child care sector.</li><li>The guidance reminds lead agencies that the CCDBG Act requires that payment rates are sufficient to ensure equal access for eligible children to child care services that are comparable to those provided to children whose parents are not eligible to receive assistance, and it notes that many states will need to make progress to meet equal access requirements in the CCDBG Act.<br></li></ul></li><li>Recommends that, secondarily, lead agencies implement policies that will:<ul><li>Build the supply of child care in low-income communities, especially for historically underserved populations</li><li>Provide child care assistance to families who have lost employment or income during the pandemic</li></ul></li></ul>



<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit</span><br></strong><br>The American Rescue Plan’s historic expansion of the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit (CDCTC) will make child care more affordable for millions of working families in 2021. Today, the Internal Revenue Service released <a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/child-and-dependent-care-tax-credit-faqs">guidance</a> providing additional details on this critical assistance.</p>



<p>Reducing the&nbsp;cost&nbsp;of child care increases labor force participation among mothers of young children— which expands the workforce, provides additional income to parents, and grows the economy. A recent&nbsp;<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-016-9331-3">review</a>&nbsp;of research on child care costs and women’s labor supply finds that a 10 percent decrease in the cost of child care to families leads to a 0.5 to 2.5 percent increase in mother’s employment.</p>



<p>Thanks to the historic expansion of the CDCTC in the American Recovery Plan, child care is more affordable for families this year, helping parents work and supporting economic security of families. Specifically:</p>



<ul><li>A median income family with two kids under age 13 will receive up to $8,000 towards their child care expenses when they file taxes for 2021, compared with a maximum of $1,200 previously.</li><li>All families with incomes up to $125,000 will save up to one-half the cost of their eligible child care expenses, getting back up to $4,000 for one child and $8,000 for two or more children when they file taxes for 2021. By comparison, the same families in 2020 would have had only up to one-fifth of their eligible expenses covered, receiving no more than $600 for one child or $1,200 for two or more children. And, in 2021, families making between $125,000 and $400,000 can still receive a partial credit at least as generous as the credit they would have received in 2020.</li><li>And, for the first time, the CDCTC will be fully refundable, making the credit fairer by allowing low-income working families to receive the full value of the credit towards their eligible child care expenses regardless of how much they owe on their 2021 taxes.</li></ul>



<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Paid Leave Tax Credit</span><br></strong><br>Today, the Internal Revenue Service is also releasing <a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/tax-credits-for-paid-leave-under-the-american-rescue-plan-act-of-2021-for-leave-after-march-31-2021">guidance</a> for the American Rescue Plan’s paid leave tax credit. The advanceable, refundable tax credit offsets the cost for employers who voluntarily provide eligible employees paid sick or family leave, either for the employee&#8217;s own health needs or to care for family members.</p>



<p>Employers with fewer than 500 employees and certain government employers may receive up to $17,110 to provide employees with up to 10 days of paid sick leave and up to 12 weeks of paid family leave, from April 1 through September 30, 2021. Certain self-employed individuals in similar circumstances are entitled to similar credits. Roughly <a href="https://cdn.advocacy.sba.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/04144224/2020-Small-Business-Economic-Profile-US.">6 million businesses</a> and more than <a href="https://cdn.advocacy.sba.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/04144224/2020-Small-Business-Economic-Profile-US.">30 million workers</a> are eligible for this credit.</p>



<p>Tax credits can be claimed for employees who take time off because they are:</p>



<ul><li>exposed to COVID-19 or experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 and seeking a diagnosis, or caring for someone who has been exposed to COVID-19 or is experiencing COVID symptoms</li><li>caring for a child whose school or child care has been closed or unavailable due to COVID–19</li><li>getting a vaccine or recovering from it</li><li>subject to, or is caring for someone who is subject to, a COVID-19 quarantine or isolation order</li></ul>



<p>The Biden Administration strongly encourages employers to provide paid leave and take advantage of these credits. They can help ensure safe and healthy workplaces, while also ensuring that Americans can reenter or stay in the workforce as we continue to fight the virus and recover from the economic effects of COVID-19. Research has shown that states where employees gained access to paid sick leave through this tax credit experienced a <a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.2020.00863">slow-down in the spread of COVID</a>.</p>



<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Investing in Child Care and Paid Leave for the Long-Term</span><br></strong><br>Finally, President Biden is calling to permanently increase access to economic relief for families, high quality child care, and available paid family and medical leave. Even before the pandemic, a middle-class life – the ability to buy a home, afford child care, send a kid to college, save up to retire with dignity – was increasingly out of reach for families, and especially for women and people of color. While the American Rescue Plan is providing historic investments to confront the effects of the pandemic and help provide immediate relief from COVID-19, the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/28/fact-sheet-the-american-families-plan/">American Families Plan</a> and <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/03/31/fact-sheet-the-american-jobs-plan/">American Jobs Plan</a> will reimagine and rebuild a new, stronger economy that leaves no one behind. They will:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Extend the historic increase in the Child Tax Credit included in the American Rescue Plan</strong>, continuing major, monthly tax relief for families of up to $3,600 for each child to help parents meet the costs of raising children.</li><li><strong>Guarantee low- and middle-income families will spend no more than 7 percent of their income on high-quality child care for young children</strong>. The President’s Council of Economic Advisers estimates, based on a recent literature review, that this cost reduction could increase employment for parents that benefit by between four and 20 percent. High-quality child care also can provide lifetime benefits for children as they grow up healthier, do better in school, and earn more over the course of their lifetimes.</li><li><strong>Make permanent the American Rescue Plan’s expansion of the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit</strong>, so that families can continue to get back up to $8,000 of their child care expenses.</li><li><strong>Build the supply of child care</strong> including by building and upgrading facilities across the country.</li><li><strong>Invest in training and professional development of the child care workforce.</strong></li><li><strong>Establish a national comprehensive paid family and medical leave program</strong> that will bring America in line with competitor nations that offer paid leave programs. This new benefit, provided by the federal government, will ensure workers partial wage replacement to take time to bond with a new child; care for a seriously ill loved one; deal with a loved one&#8217;s military deployment; find safety from sexual assault, stalking, or domestic violence; heal from their own serious illness; or take time to deal with the death of a loved one. It will be available to workers regardless of employer size, sector, or type of employment.</li></ul>



<p>These investments will help build on the momentum of the American Rescue Plan to create a stronger, more equitable economy that supports families and strengthens the middle class.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>The Child Care Development Block Grant guidance released today will help states invest the $15 billion provided to them on </strong><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/15/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-american-rescue-plan-funding-to-rescue-the-child-care-industry-so-the-economy-can-recover/"><strong>April 15</strong></a><strong>.</strong> </span>The American Rescue Plan’s historic $39 billion investment in child care was provided to state, tribal, and territorial partners through two programs: (1) $24 billion for a new child care stabilization fund to help child care providers reopen or stay open, provide safe and healthy learning environments<strong>, </strong>keep workers on payroll, and provide mental health supports for educators and children, and (2) $15 billion in more flexible funding to help more low-income working families access high-quality care, increase compensation for early childhood workers, and help parents to work. A breakdown of funds received by State, Tribe and Territory is below.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>The United States is rallying the world’s democracies to deliver for our people, meet the world’s biggest challenges, and demonstrate our shared values</em></p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">Today, President Biden will meet with G7 leaders to discuss ways to forge a more fair, sustainable, and inclusive global economy that meets the unique challenges of our time. President Biden and G7 partners are committed to a global recovery that benefits the middle class and working families at home and around the world.</p>



<p>President Biden and G7 leaders agreed to continue providing policy support to the global economy for as long as necessary to create a strong, balanced, and inclusive economic recovery.&nbsp; In addition, leaders are expected to announce that the G7 is:</p>



<p><strong>Rallying around the US proposal for Strong Global Minimum Tax.  </strong>G7 leaders will endorse a strong global minimum tax of at least 15 percent. This U.S. priority is a critical step towards ending the decades-long race to the bottom that pushes nations to compete over who can offer the lowest tax rate to large corporations at the expense of protecting workers, investing in infrastructure, and growing the middle class.</p>



<p>This unprecedented progress reflects the Biden Administration’s commitment to building a global tax system that is equitable and equipped to meet the needs of the 21st century global economy. By making big multinational corporations pay their fair share and raising resources to fund priorities for domestic renewal – such as infrastructure, childcare, affordable housing, and education – a global corporate minimum tax is a key part of our efforts to deliver a foreign policy for the middle class, and will help support working families everywhere.&nbsp; This agreement is a clear illustration of how American leadership and commitment to multilateralism can produce results for American workers and businesses.<br><br>Today’s agreement paves the way for the removal of Digital Service Taxes (DSTs) and other discriminatory taxes. In addition to agreement on a global minimum tax, the G7 also reached historic agreement on a plan to replace DSTs with a broader reallocation of taxing rights to the places where the largest and most profitable multinational corporations are doing business and making money. Importantly, this applies to large multinationals broadly, both domestic and foreign, and not just the technology sector. This is an important principle for the United States, and will ensure that big multinational companies across the economy will pay a little more in the places where they operate, whether or not they have their headquarters there.<br><br><strong>Exploring a Major Reallocation of Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) to Countries in Need:&nbsp; </strong>The United States and our G7 partners are actively considering a global effort to multiply the impact of the International Monetary Fund’s proposed&nbsp; Special Drawing Rights (SDR) allocation to the countries most in need.&nbsp; At potentially up to $100 billion in size, the proposed effort would further support health needs &#8211; including vaccinations &#8211; and help enable greener, more robust economic recoveries in vulnerable countries, and promote a more balanced, sustained, and inclusive global recovery.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>More detail will be included in the G7 Leaders’ Communique.</p>
