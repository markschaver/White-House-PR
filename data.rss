<p class="has-text-align-center">Aboard Air Force One<br>En Route Madrid, Spain</p>



<p>2:10 P.M. CEST<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Okay, well, welcome to our second leg of the trip, heading to Spain, Madrid, specifically.&nbsp; Jake Sullivan here, our National Security Advisor &#8212; the President&#8217;s National Security Advisor &#8212; is going to give us a little bit lay of the land for NATO and answer any of your questions.</p>



<p>Go ahead, Jake.</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; Thanks, everybody.&nbsp; We&#8217;re obviously on our way to Madrid for what we expect will be a historic NATO Summit at a time of war in Europe.&nbsp;</p>



<p>NATO today is more united, determined, and purposeful than it&#8217;s been at any point in modern memory.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s in no small part because of the intense diplomacy and leadership that President Biden has invested over the course of the past few months, including hosting a virtual NATO Summit immediately after Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine in February and then calling for an emergency summit in Brussels a month later.</p>



<p>So, NATO leaders will now have had three opportunities since the start of the war to get together, once virtually and now twice in person.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, obviously, Ukraine will be top of mind with Russia’s ongoing brutality most recently on display with this gruesome and horrific attack on the shopping center yesterday.</p>



<p>And then, NATO Allies will have the opportunity to talk about capabilities and other forms of military assistance they&#8217;ll be providing to Ukraine on an ongoing basis in the coming days and months.&nbsp; And they&#8217;ll also have an opportunity to reaffirm their determination to remain united for as long as it takes to ensure a sovereign and independent Ukraine and that Russia pays a severe price for its wanton aggression against Ukraine.</p>



<p>More broadly, this summit will provide an opportunity to set the strategic direction for the Alliance for the coming years.&nbsp; And one of the things that will be a significant outcome of the summit will be a new Strategic Concept.&nbsp; The last Strategic Concept was agreed among Allies in 2010, 12 years ago.&nbsp; So this is the first NATO Summit to produce a new Strategic Concept since then.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That Strategic Concept described Russia as a strategic partner and did not refer to China.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This Strategic Concept will describe in stark terms the threat that Russia poses and the way in which it has shattered peace in Europe.&nbsp; It will speak very directly and in a clear-eyed way to the multifaceted challenge posed by the People&#8217;s Republic of China.&nbsp; And it will also address modern and emerging threats, cyber and emerging technologies, hybrid warfare, the growing national security implications of climate change, and of course, the evolving threat of terrorism, which has changed over the course of the 20 years since the Alliance went into Afghanistan back in 2001.</p>



<p>In addition to the Strategic Concept, which will be agreed and adopted by leaders, the Alliance will also agree on specific targets for increased common funding for NATO, for its various budgets, to ensure that all of the strategic lines of effort that are captured in that Strategic Concept are fully resourced and that NATO has the funding that is required for it to be able to actually carry out its activities.</p>



<p>One note on that: In addition to the deliverable of common funding at the summit, what will be on display is a marked increase in national contributions by countries to the point where we anticipate, at this summit, you will see that a strong majority of NATO Allies will be either at the 2 percent Wales benchmark or on track to meet it by 2024, which is a &#8212; just over the course of the past 18 months, a substantial shift in the intensity and commitment of NATO Allies in terms of putting their money where their mouth is.</p>



<p>Germany, obviously, made a historic announcement earlier this year; other countries have followed suit.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re seeing a real commitment across the board for countries to actually make the contributions to national capabilities necessary for the Alliance to be very strong.</p>



<p>The other area where we expect to see a significant, indeed historic, set of deliverables is on the issue of force posture.&nbsp; The President said before the war started that if Putin invaded Ukraine, the United States and NATO would enhance its force posture on the eastern flank, not just for the duration of the crisis, but to address the long-term change in the strategic reality that that would present.</p>



<p>And in this summit, you will see the Alliance follow through on that commitment and the United States follow through on that commitment.&nbsp; You&#8217;ll see a number of countries making commitments to increase their defense contributions to the eastern flank of the Alliance, with a special emphasis on the Balkan &#8212; the Baltics, but also other eastern flank allies as well.</p>



<p>And the United States will be making specific announcements tomorrow on land, sea, and air of additional force posture commitments over the long term, beyond the duration of this crisis, however long it goes on.</p>



<p>One of those announcements, which the President will lay out today when he meets with the Spanish President, will be an increase in the number of destroyers based at Rota, Spain, from four to six destroyers.&nbsp; Those will help increase the United States’ and NATO&#8217;s maritime presence and all the relevant maritime domains in the Euro-Atlantic area.&nbsp; But that will be just the first of several specific announcements, the rest of which we will lay out for you all tomorrow, on the first day of the NATO Summit.</p>



<p>And we think by the end of the summit, what you will see is a more robust, more effective, more combat-credible, more capable, and more determined force posture to take account of a more acute and aggravated Russian threat, not just because of what they&#8217;ve done in Ukraine, but also because of the way in which they have changed their posture vis-à-vis Belarus, which has an impact on many of our Allies, especially our Baltic Allies.</p>



<p>So we&#8217;ll go into more specifics on that set of announcements tomorrow.&nbsp; But that, we believe, will be a very important part of the outcome of this summit.</p>



<p>Final thing to put on the table is: In addition to the meeting of 30 leaders tomorrow morning &#8212; the 30 Allies &#8212; there will be an afternoon session with partners, and it will display the strong partnership that Finland and Sweden have already shown as NATO partners.&nbsp; But Allies, including the United States, will have the chance to lift up and lend their voice to &#8212; their voice of support to Finland and Sweden joining the Alliance.&nbsp; And we will continue to work with Turkey to address their concerns so that Finland and Sweden can ultimately become members of NATO and help contribute in an even more direct way to the security of the Euro-Atlantic area and to the NATO Alliance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We will also have four Asia Pacific partners for the first time ever at a NATO summit.&nbsp; This is consistent with President Biden&#8217;s very strong view and central premise that the linkage in security between the Indo-Pacific and the Euro-Atlantic is only deepening.&nbsp; And so, the ties between allies in the two theaters have to deepen as well, not because NATO is going to go be fighting wars in the Pacific but because there is an interconnection between the robustness and vitality of our Asia-Pacific alliances and our Euro-Atlantic alliances.&nbsp; And so Japan, Korea, Australia, and New Zealand will all be present.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The President, tomorrow, will have the opportunity to host a trilateral meeting with the President of Korea and the Prime Minister of Japan.&nbsp; This will be the first trilateral leaders-level meeting that we&#8217;ve had in some time among the leaders of these three countries.&nbsp; And it will be mainly focused on the continuing threat from the DPRK, particularly after an extended period of intense testing and other provocative activities that the &#8212; that the North Koreans have undertaken.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But in the session more broadly, he&#8217;ll have the opportunity to talk with our Indo-Pacific partners and the NATO Alliance about the China challenge and the ways in which it increasingly is a relevant factor for the NATO Alliance, as will be reflected in the Strategic Concept.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So I&#8217;ll stop there, and happy to take your questions.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jake, just on NATO accession: President Erdoğan said that the President asked him for a meeting either tonight or tomorrow.&nbsp; Are they going to have a &#8212; sort of a formal engagement?&nbsp; And does the President now see a direct role for the United States in brokering NATO accessions for Finland and Sweden?&nbsp; And are there U.S. inducements that could help sort of sweeten the deal or grease the wheels for Turkey here?</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; The Secretary General of NATO has taken the lead &#8212; appropriately and correctly &#8212; in working with Finland and Sweden on the one hand and Turkey on the other hand to find a way forward that addresses Turkey’s concerns and ultimately delivers Finland and Sweden&#8217;s entry into the Alliance.&nbsp; We believe that is how it should be and how it will remain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The United States is not going to supplant the Secretary General or take on a brokering role in this.&nbsp; Rather, we&#8217;re going to do what many other Allies have done, which is indicate publicly and privately that we believe it is in the interest of the Alliance to get this done.&nbsp; And we also believe that Finland and Sweden have taken significant steps forward in terms of addressing Turkey&#8217;s concerns.&nbsp; We also believe and are confident that, ultimately, they will become members of the Alliance and that Turkey&#8217;s concerns will be fully addressed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In terms of a bilateral meeting: We do expect, at some point tomorrow, President Erdoğan and President Biden have the chance to talk.&nbsp; What the modalities of that will be precisely are still being worked out.&nbsp; There&#8217;s not a fixed time or &#8212; or framework for the meeting, but they&#8217;ll have a chance to spend some time together to focus mainly on the strategic issues between the U.S. and Turkey and regional issues that are relevant to the two countries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course, the issue of Finland and Sweden will come up but we don&#8217;t anticipate that that&#8217;s going to be the central focus of the President&#8217;s meeting with President Erdoğan.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just on force posture: You mentioned persistent presence on the eastern flank.&nbsp; Is that going to be permanent basing?&nbsp; Because obviously there’s the NATO-Russia agreement from the late ‘90s.&nbsp; There’s agreement or commitment not to have permanent &#8212; permanent seems to be a bit of a (inaudible).&nbsp; Does the U.S. believe NATO is bound by that commitment to Russia from 25 years ago not to have permanent basing on its &#8212; on its borders?</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; So, I am not going to get ahead of our announcement tomorrow.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll just say to you: Stay tuned in terms of the elements that will be part of that, which will involve additional forces on the eastern flank in a steady state.&nbsp; But to the particular question on rotational, permanent, et cetera: Stay tuned.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a question that is not about NATO but is relevant to this week.&nbsp; Brittney Griner faces a trial in Russia.&nbsp; What is the Biden administration doing to help her, to get her home?&nbsp; What&#8217;s the involvement?&nbsp; And do you have any update on how she&#8217;s doing?</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; So, first, Brittney Griner is wrongfully detained, unjustly detained, and we have made that clear as an official determination of the U.S. government.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Second, the Russian government should release her and allow her to be returned and reunited with her family and come home safe and sound.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Third, both myself and Secretary Blinken have had the opportunity, just in the last few days, to speak with her &#8212; with her wife, Cherelle, and to convey our very deep sympathy, to convey that, you know, we just can&#8217;t even begin to imagine what the family must be going through, what Brittney &#8212; what Brittney must be going through.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The United States government is actively engaged in trying to resolve this case and get Brittney home.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not going to get into the details of what that means because these are sensitive matters.&nbsp; But I will tell you it has the fullest attention of the President and every senior member of his national security and diplomatic team.&nbsp; And we are actively working to find a resolution to this case, and will continue to do so without rest until we get Brittney safely home.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We also are trying to work actively to return all unjustly detained Americans and hostages being held overseas, whether that be in Iran or Afghanistan or Russia or Venezuela or China or elsewhere.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jake, President Zelenskyy has made clear that he wants this war to draw to a close by the end of this year and believes that Ukraine, by the winter, can regain the territory it has currently lost by Russia.&nbsp; What does the U.S. think of that assessment?</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; So we discussed this a little bit yesterday with the pool.&nbsp; And I don&#8217;t want to characterize President Zelenskyy’s words.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll let him speak for himself publicly on this matter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I would just say that at the &#8212; at multiple levels &#8212; diplomatic, military to military, and President to President &#8212; we&#8217;ve had very deep and detailed discussions with the Ukrainians about their plans, about how they intend to proceed, both in terms of trying to halt Russian advances in the east and, ultimately, take back territory in the south and other places.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re communicating with them our analysis and assessment of those plans.&nbsp; We&#8217;re doing so privately.&nbsp; But, in general,</p>



<p>we believe that it is the Ukrainians who should be setting the course of the objectives in the war, and the United States and our Allies and partners who should be supplying them with the capabilities to be able to achieve those objectives.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s what we&#8217;re focused on, and that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re doing.&nbsp; And that will continue in the days and weeks ahead, including through the recent delivery of the HIMARS that we believe are now being used to good effect on the battlefield.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jake, I wanted to ask you about the oil price cap discussions.&nbsp; The French pushed for that to be not just referencing Russia but also other countries in the world, including the United States?&nbsp; Can you say a word about that?&nbsp;</p>



<p>And can you &#8212;</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; Sorry &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; so that &#8212;</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; &#8212; including the United States?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, just to sort of have it be a broader initiative by the G7 rather than just focused solely on Russia.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I wanted to ask you: You know, Prime Minister Modi was there.&nbsp; Were there discussions with him about India&#8217;s purchases of Russian oil?&nbsp; And &#8212; or do you see any kind of progress on that front?</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; So, what ministers have now been tasked with by the leaders is to work on the specifics of how a price cap would actually work.&nbsp; One aspect of that, of course, is intensive engagement with key consuming countries.&nbsp; India is one of those countries.&nbsp; That engagement has begun.&nbsp; We have begun talks with India about how a price cap would work and what the implications of it would be.&nbsp; And I will leave it at that because, of course, those are ongoing diplomatic discussions.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did the President speak with Prime Minister Modi about this issue specifically?</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; The President did not speak with Prime Minister Modi about this yesterday, but at senior levels of the U.S. government, we had communications with the Indians yesterday.&nbsp; Before it goes to leader-to-leader level, we need to work through the details with their team at basically the Cabinet level, which is where it is right now.&nbsp; And then, if necessary, it can be elevated.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the trilat that you&#8217;re doing tomorrow or &#8212; tomorrow, right? &#8212; Janet Yellen &#8212; Secretary Yellen is going to be going to Korea as well, as part of her Asia trip, including the G20.&nbsp; Are you &#8212; do you see any scope to be moving toward additional sanctions on North Korea?&nbsp; And would that even be effective in terms of their nuclear testing program?</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; We actually have kept up a tempo of sanctions over the course of the 18 months.&nbsp; And we are constantly looking for new targets, especially because North Korea adjusts its methods of acquiring revenue constantly.&nbsp; And so we need to constantly be looking for ways to cut off those new sources of revenue.&nbsp; And that is something that will be a matter of real consultation between Secretary Yellen and the financial watchdogs in North Korea &#8212; in South Korea. &nbsp;</p>



<p>And the President will have the opportunity with President Yoon and Prime Minister Kishida to discuss what we can do on the economic pressure side, particularly when it comes to depriving the North of hard currency that they use to fund their nuclear and missile programs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jake, on China and the Strategic Concept, can you talk a little bit more about the language, what it will say vis-à-vis Taiwan?&nbsp;</p>



<p>And then, the G7 leaders have just also had, you know, a large portion of their statement about China, saying they&#8217;re calling on Beijing to press Russia to stop their aggression.&nbsp; What exactly do the G7 leaders want?&nbsp; Do they want more public pressure?&nbsp; Do they want anything public?&nbsp; What have you guys agreed on to have Xi Jinping weigh in there?</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; So, first, the &#8212; for us, the number-one priority with respect to China, when it comes to the war in Ukraine, is that China not become militarily supportive of Russia through the provision of equipment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Number two is that they not engage in wholesale or systematic undermining or evasion of U.S. sanctions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And on both of those, thus far, we have not seen China act in a way inconsistent with those two principles and certainly not at scale with respect to the economic relationship.&nbsp; So we want to see that continue.</p>



<p>In addition, as you noted, in the G7 statement, the leaders want to communicate to the PRC that the PRC, if it seeks to act as a responsible global player, should be using its relationship with and influence with Moscow.&nbsp; Whether that takes place publicly or privately is less relevant to us than that Xi Jinping communicate to Putin that what Russia is doing through this invasion and through this brutal war is having ripple effects through the world that is causing harm in the global south and elsewhere, and that the responsibility for that lies at the feet of the Russian government.&nbsp; And the fastest way to stop those negative ripple effects would be for Russia to stop the war.</p>



<p>So, yes, we believe that China cannot evade responsibility, given its relationship with Russia, for speaking more clearly to them.&nbsp; You know, from my perspective, that happening privately as opposed to publicly, it would be just fine if it produced a positive result.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jake, there was a video that came out yesterday from the G7 where President Macron is talking to both President Biden and yourself about Saudi Arabia &#8212; the fact that they&#8217;re almost at maximum capacity and can&#8217;t produce that much more oil.&nbsp; Does that change the President&#8217;s thinking at all going into his trip next month?&nbsp; And did any other leaders approach him about his trip to Saudi Arabia?</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; I&#8217;m not going to characterize President Macron’s comments yesterday.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And with respect to the question of his discussions with other leaders, he spoke with President Macron about the trip.&nbsp; I &#8212; he spoke with a couple of other leaders about the trip as well, not focused on or confined to the energy piece, but the broader strategic dynamic at play and the need, particularly in light of Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine, for the United States, the G7, and the West to continue robust and effective engagement with our partners across the Middle East to include the GCC, as well as Iraq, Jordan, and Egypt, all of whom the President will see when he goes &#8212; when he goes to Saudi Arabia.</p>



<p>And then, of course, he talked about Israel and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as well with some of the leaders.&nbsp; But I&#8217;m not going to characterize President Macron’s comments or, you know, either the content of them or the &#8212; this particular notion about Saudi Arabia and its spare capacity.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Caracas, there&#8217;s a report that, you know, we &#8212; or you&#8217;ve confirmed that senior administration officials went to Caracas.&nbsp; You mentioned freeing Americans there.&nbsp; What else can happen in terms of oil prices, particularly with an eye to the really bad financial inflation issues facing the United States?&nbsp; Are you asking for any kind of specific efforts or measures by Venezuela on the oil front?</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; What we have said consistently is that we will only provide sanctions relief in return for concrete progress at the negotiating table.&nbsp; A few weeks ago, we gave a very specific license, and removed a few days ago a sanction, as part of an effort to get the talks in Mexico City back up and running effectively and with the support of the opposition.</p>



<p>A next step, in terms of further licenses, would have to be connected to progress &#8212; tangible progress at the negotiating table.&nbsp; We regard that as possible, but we want to see it actually happen.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jake, there’s a report of a meeting in Sharm el-Sheikh a couple of weeks ago that the U.S. helped organize with leaders from Israel, Saudi Arabia, other regional partners in trying to counter the air threat or &#8212; from &#8212; missile threat from Iran.&nbsp; Can you confirm that?&nbsp; And is that a deliverable you&#8217;re eyeing for the next trip in a couple weeks?</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; I&#8217;d refer you to CENTCOM on that particular report.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re not looking for a specific missile defense deliverable on the trip, although deeper integration and deeper cooperation among all the countries of the region against the Iranian threat, including the Iranian missile threat, is a real priority of this administration, and we expect to continue to move the ball down the field on that, including during the President&#8217;s trip.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I go back to China again?&nbsp; The G7 also commented on China&#8217;s coercive non-market practices.&nbsp; The Biden administration &#8212; you know, this is not really anything new, but you guys have essentially been ready to go on your own investigation.&nbsp; What is the holdup here?&nbsp; And is the holdup at all related to your efforts in trying to get Xi Jinping to pressure Moscow on the war?</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; No.&nbsp; The short answer and the unequivocal answer is “no.”&nbsp; There&#8217;s no connection between our conversations with China on the Ukraine war &#8212; Russia’s war in Ukraine and the issue of tariffs and a potential set of steps the United States would take on &#8212; vis-à-vis China trade.</p>



<p>You know, I&#8217;ve said to you guys before and the President has said this is something he&#8217;s looking at, he&#8217;s analyzing; there&#8217;s a lot of different elements to it.&nbsp; And the President wants to be sure that he&#8217;s put together the right approach before he moves out with it.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t think he feels that there is a particular deadline for it.&nbsp; Getting it right is more important than just doing it fast, despite the fact that I know it is leaving all of you guys to have to ask the question week after week.</p>



<p>From our perspective, it’s something we&#8217;re looking at, the President continues to look at.&nbsp; When he has a decision to make, he&#8217;ll make the decision and we’ll move forward from there.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just one more on Is- &#8212; on the Belarus.&nbsp; The Russians have said they&#8217;re going to supply the Iskander missiles to Belarus, which are nuclear capable.&nbsp; I’m wondering if that is a particular concern to you and whether that changes the dynamic to know that there are these nuclear &#8212; will be these nuclear-capable missiles in both Kaliningrad and Belarus.</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; The most important thing to us is what actually happens on the ground, not the theater between Putin and Lukashenko.&nbsp; And this was another one of those instances where they have this made-for-TV conversation that involve not just the Iskanders, but also whether there would be the provision of strategic bombers.&nbsp; And Putin said, “I will withhold those.”</p>



<p>So, will there be Iskander missiles for the long term?&nbsp; Putin says “yes,” but let&#8217;s see.&nbsp; Will there be strategic bombers in Belarus for the long term?&nbsp; Putin says “no,” but we&#8217;ll see.</p>



<p>So, we&#8217;re going to watch and see what actually happens.&nbsp; And, of course, if Russian military deployments, including nuclear deployments in Belarus, occur and are sustained, that is a matter of concern for the entire NATO Alliance, it is a matter of concern for the United States, and it is something that we will take into account as we think about our own force posture.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just one last one.&nbsp; Russia today released a bunch of new sanctions on U.S. officials, including the First Lady.&nbsp; I was wondering if you had any immediate reaction to that, just given that it seems to be a targeted effort to punish the President’s spouse.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; I have no reaction to that other than it just goes to show you that the Russian capacity for these kinds of cynical moves is basically bottomless, so it probably shouldn&#8217;t come as a surprise to any of us that they would do something like this.</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; All right.&nbsp; Thanks, everybody.&nbsp; Thanks, Jake.&nbsp; Appreciate it.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karine, are you going to stick around?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have &#8212; I don&#8217;t have a topper, but whatever &#8212; what do you guys want to talk about?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you tell us about what the White House&#8217;s reaction is to this incident in San Antonio with the migrants found in the truck and if this points to a larger problem on the border?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; It’s devastating.&nbsp; So, we&#8217;re closely monitoring the absolutely horrific and heartbreaking reports out of San Antonio, Texas.&nbsp; And I can tell you the President has been briefed and is going to continue to be regularly updated.</p>



<p>Our prayers are with those who tragically lost their lives, their loved ones, as well as those still fighting for their lives.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re also grateful for the swift work of federal, state, and local first responders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As Secretary Mayorkas said, “Far too many lives have been lost…[to] this dangerous journey.”&nbsp; We will continue to take action to disrupt human smuggling networks, which have no regard for lives.&nbsp; They explo- &#8212; exploit and endanger in order to make a profit.</p>



<p>As you know, the Department of Homeland Security is closely handling this and watching this as well.&nbsp; So, any specifics, I would refer you to them.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karine &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; Republican lawmakers blame the President and his policies for the &#8212; for that loss of life.&nbsp; I was wondering if you have any response to that.&nbsp; And does the President believe that the continued sort of &#8212; you know, his inability to lift border protections by those two federal court orders may have contributed to this tragedy?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; So, 46 people died &#8212; right? &#8212; in the state of Texas, and so &#8212; and others, as I just mentioned, are still fighting for their lives.</p>



<p>So we&#8217;re still learning their names.&nbsp; Their families are still learning they lost loved ones, as when a tragic situation normally happens.&nbsp; We&#8217;re focused on them, on the facts, and holding the human <s>strugglers</s> [smugglers] who endangered vulnerable individual &#8212; individuals for profits accountable.</p>



<p>And we&#8217;re &#8212; and we&#8217;re focused on continuing our historic actions to disrupt dangerous smuggling networks, including through a new anti-smuggling campaign that just in the first two months resulted in over 1,800 arrests.&nbsp; But the fact of the matter is the border is closed, which is in part why you see people trying to make this dangerous journey using smuggling networks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Again, our hearts go out to the families at this time.&nbsp; We are going to stay focused on the facts and making sure that we hold these smugglers accountable.&nbsp; That&#8217;s going to be our focus.</p>



<p>Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So on the Roe v. Wade situation, there&#8217;s &#8212; you know, have been calls for &#8212; I think we talked about this the other day about, you know, building some kind of facilities on federal lands.&nbsp; Are you any further along in terms of exploring those options?&nbsp; And would it be a possibility to come to some agreement with Tribes to use Tribal lands?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; So with this proposal &#8212; we understand the proposal is well intentioned, but here&#8217;s the thing: It could actually put women and providers at risk.&nbsp; And importantly, in states where abortion is now illegal, women and providers who are not federal employees &#8212; as you look at the federal lands &#8212; could be &#8212; potentially be prosecuted.&nbsp; And so, this is &#8212; as we understand why they would put forward this proposal, there&#8217;s actually dangerous ramifications to doing this.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So you can’t offer sanct- &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So that’s a no?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can’t offer sanctuary on federal property?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; So I don&#8217;t have any more to share on that.&nbsp; I &#8212; you know, this is &#8212; as we have mentioned, we&#8217;re looking at some &#8212; we’re looking at an array of other options.</p>



<p>We mentioned &#8212; the President on Friday, as you know, spoke to two first steps &#8212; concrete first steps that we believe will help women get the help that they need to make their decisions for themselves, the he- &#8212; for their healthcare.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I just don&#8217;t have anything else to share &#8212; anything specific on that, but wanted to lay out what that proposal actually meant and so that you have the full breadth of the &#8212; of the meaning of what it would be to do that.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So the President is on this trip right now.&nbsp; Vice President Harris is doing interviews about the decision and about administrative action.&nbsp; You have Cabinet members making public statements.&nbsp; When is the public going to hear from the President again on this?&nbsp; Does he think that the Vice President is a better message on this &#8212; messenger on this than he is?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; No, it has nothing to do with the &#8212; with who&#8217;s the best messenger.&nbsp; He&#8217;s the President of the United States, right?&nbsp; When the President speaks, people listen and it &#8212; and it goes far and wide and it carries weight, obviously.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As he spoke on Friday &#8212; the reason why he went out and spoke two hours after the decision was made is because he wanted to make sure he spoke directly to the American people, and he spoke in a very forceful way.&nbsp; He understands the devastation and how stunning this decision was, and he wanted to show that he was using his executive authority to act.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so, you&#8217;re going to hear from the President, because this is &#8212; this is def- &#8212; to show how important this is, you&#8217;re going to hear from the President &#8212; not just from the President, but also the Vice President, his Cabinet secretaries.&nbsp; They have made an announcement in the last couple of days on how they&#8217;re moving forward with the two concrete steps that he&#8217;s taken.&nbsp; And you&#8217;re going to hear from the Vice President, which all makes sense in this moment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Like, this is a &#8212; you know, as I said, this is stunning, this is devastating, this is going to cause really terrible consequences for so many people &#8212; women across the country.</p>



<p>And the President on Friday was very clear.&nbsp; He said you &#8212; he said Congress has to act.&nbsp; We&#8217;re going to do these two &#8212; first two initial steps; Congress needs to act.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And the way that we&#8217;re going to codify Roe is to make sure that it&#8217;s the law of the land, and there&#8217;s no executive action that&#8217;s going to make it law of the land.&nbsp; And if we can&#8217;t do that &#8212; if Congress won&#8217;t do that, then, you know, Americans have to make their voices very clear at the ballot box.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is he going to get out on the road and make that case in &#8212; like, next week?&nbsp; Or when can people expect to hear him making that argument?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; So I just mentioned this is incredibly important to the President.&nbsp; He&#8217;s going to continue to talk about this, continue to look at what other options are available to make sure that women are able to have the healthcare that they need.&nbsp; I just don&#8217;t have anything to preview at this time.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karine &#8212; last one, I guess &#8212; on the January 6th Committee scheduling a surprise hearing today: Is the President going to be watching that?&nbsp; Or is he interested in seeing what the committee has to present on such &#8212; on such short notice?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; So, as you know, we&#8217;re headed to NATO.&nbsp; We’re hopefully going to land very shortly in Spain &#8212; Madrid, Spain &#8212; where the President is going to do, as we&#8217;ve talked about, leader-to-leader conversation on some important agenda, important issues for the &#8212; for the NATO members as we go into this for the next couple of days.</p>



<p>Look, we&#8217;ve been very, very clear.&nbsp; You know, January 6th, was a &#8212; was a dark, dark day in our democracy.&nbsp; It was not just an attack on our democracy, an attack on our law enforcement.&nbsp; And he believes, we believe that it is important for the American public to watch and to see and to learn exactly what happened on that day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so, we support the January 6th Select Committee.&nbsp; We have full confidence in them.&nbsp; And we just need to make sure that we get to the bottom of exactly the details of what happened on that day.</p>



<p>All right?&nbsp; Thanks, everybody.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p><em>Record-Breaking Private U.S. Investments to Help Build 250,000 Chargers Per Year, Create More Than 2,000 Jobs</em><br>Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is highlighting how President Biden’s leadership on electric vehicles is catalyzing more than $700 million in investments from the private sector that will increase our domestic capacity to manufacture more than 250,000 new electric vehicle (EV) chargers each year, add at least 2,000 good-paying jobs, and make EV charging more affordable, accessible, and equitable. The historic private investments will follow the $7.5 billion from President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to build a national network of EV chargers, enabling convenient and uniform charging at home, work, and across the country.<br><br>President Biden’s vison, leadership and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law have positioned the United States to lead the electric future and make it in America. The President <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/08/05/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-steps-to-drive-american-leadership-forward-on-clean-cars-and-trucks/">united</a> automakers and autoworkers around an ambitious target for 50% of new vehicles sold in 2030 to be electric, passed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/06/09/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-proposes-new-standards-for-national-electric-vehicle-charging-network/">build a national network of chargers</a> for a seamless charging experience, and <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/12/08/fact-sheet-president-biden-signs-executive-order-catalyzing-americas-clean-energy-economy-through-federal-sustainability/">activated</a> the federal government’s purchasing power to procure more zero-emission vehicles by 2027 and 100% zero-emission vehicles by 2035. The President’s actions will make EV charging convenient, reliable, and affordable for all Americans, including when driving long distances.<br><br>Today’s announcements demonstrate how the President is catalyzing private investment to boost our domestic manufacturing capacity, enabling America to create a national network of chargers and create thousands of new high-quality, union jobs building, installing, and maintaining it. Today, the auto industry renaissance continues as the private sector steps up to invest in American-made charging across the country.<br><br><strong><u>KEY INDUSTRY INVESTMENTS</u></strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>Electrify America</strong>, a leading network of fast chargers, today announced a new investment of $450 million into its charging network by Siemens, a global technology and electrification leader, and Volkswagen Group. These investments will support the rapid deployment of up to 10,000 ultra-fast chargers at 1,800 charging stations, more than the number of high-power chargers available in the United States today.<br></li><li><strong>Siemens </strong>is on track to build one million EV chargers over the next four years by investing more than $250 million in the U.S. in the past six months, including expansions of its Grand Prairie, TX and Pomona, CA manufacturing sites. Siemens has created 500 new, good-quality, union manufacturing jobs across the U.S to support critical power and EV charging infrastructure. And, they announced a $25 million minority stake investment in a US-based wireless charging company. Siemens has a new manufacturing facility coming online later this year and is introducing a new Buy America-compliant AC charger this fall.</li></ul>



<p><strong><u>ADDITIONAL INDUSTRY ACTIONS</u></strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>ABB E-mobility </strong>is adding 125 jobs across its operations this year alone, including at two new facilities. In Sugarland, Texas, they are opening a training center where ABB will provide authorized service partners with hands on training for servicing and maintaining EV chargers. In Southern California, ABB E-mobility is opening a product development and research facility where it will design, develop, and test EV chargers for the U.S. market.<br></li><li><strong>ChargePoint</strong>, a leading EV charging network, is expanding its partnership with SMTC Corporation to expand DCFC production, establish a manufacturing line for Level 2 chargers at their Milpitas, CA, facility, and create approximately 250 new manufacturing jobs. The expanded facility will be able to produce 10,000 DCFC dispensers and 10,000 Level 2 chargers by 2026.<br></li><li><strong>FLO, </strong>a North American EV charging network operator and smart charging solutions provider, announced a $3 million investment in its first U.S. assembly facility located in Auburn Hills, Michigan earlier this month. By 2028, the facility will produce upwards of 30,000 Buy America compliant charging stations and fast chargers annually, create upwards of 730 jobs, and bolster Michigan’s economy by $76 million.<br></li><li><strong>Tesla</strong> is making <em>investments at its Gigafactory in Buffalo, New York</em> to support the deployment of new fast charging stations to add to its fast-charging network. More than 1,600 employees work at Giga New York producing the Tesla Solar Roof and Supercharger stations, which are capable of charging vehicles up to 250 kW. Tesla is expanding production capacity of power electronics components that convert alternating current to direct current, charging cabinets, posts and cables. Later this year, Tesla will begin production of new Supercharger equipment that will enable non-Tesla EV drivers in North America to use Tesla Superchargers.<br></li><li><strong>Tritium</strong>, who previously <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/02/08/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-ensuring-future-is-made-in-america/">announced</a> a Tennessee EV charger manufacturing facility at a White House event with President Biden, is accelerating its production schedule to manufacture DC fast chargers in the third quarter of 2022. They also plan to build their first Buy America chargers in early 2023. This facility will create more than 500 local jobs and will be capable of producing up to 30,000 fast charger units per year.</li></ul>



<p><strong><u>WORKFORCE DEVELOPMMENT AND EQUITY</u></strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>IBEW</strong>, as part of the Administration’s <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/06/17/fact-sheet-the-biden-harris-administration-launches-the-talent-pipeline-challenge-supporting-employer-investments-in-equitable-workforce-development-for-infrastructure-jobs/">Talent Pipeline Challenge,</a> pledged to train 10,000 of their members through the Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Training Program (EVITP) by this August. Philanthropies, including the Hewlett Foundation, committed a total of $250,000 to support women and workers of color training for the EVITP-certification – with an emphasis on geographic diversity.  <br></li><li><strong>ChargePoint </strong>recently partnered with the National Electrical Contractors Association (NECA) to prepare its nearly 4,000-member companies, all of which are IBEW unionized, to install EV charging infrastructure quickly and professionally in advance of the release of NEVI funding to States.<br></li><li><strong>Volta</strong>, a national owner operated ad-driven EV charging provider, expanded its &#8220;Charging for All&#8221; initiative, a multimillion-dollar commitment to ramp up equitable planning and charging investment. They will use PredictEV, a planning intelligence platform, to extend services to any state or city looking to maximize impact of public investment, while also delivering free media-space to State Departments of Transportation to ensure inclusive engagement.</li></ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>9:10 A.M. CEST<br>&nbsp;<br>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Hi, everyone.&nbsp; It’s [moderator].&nbsp; We&#8217;ll go ahead and get started.&nbsp; I know the time is limited.</p>



<p>So this call is on background, attributable to a “senior administration official.”&nbsp; And for your awareness and not for reporting, our speaker today is [senior administration official].&nbsp; We just have a couple of things at the top.&nbsp; And then, hopefully, we can take some questions and go from there.</p>



<p>And then, as a reminder, after the G7 ends, we&#8217;re going to head to Madrid for NATO, and Jake and Karine are going to be gaggling on the record on the plane then as well.</p>



<p>So, [senior administration official], over to you.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Thanks, [moderator], and thanks, everyone, for joining.&nbsp; I’ll keep this short and take a few questions.</p>



<p>A couple of notes up at the top on some new commitments being made and then happy to hear from you.</p>



<p>First, the G7 will commit to contribute up to $5 billion to address global food security, over half of which will come from the United States.&nbsp; President Biden will commit $2.76 billion in additional U.S. government funding to support efforts in over 47 countries and regional organizations.</p>



<p>Of that $2.76 billion, $2 billion will go to help save lives through direct humanitarian interventions, and $760 million of that will be for sustainable near-term and medium-term food assistance to help enhance the resilience and productivity of food systems around the world, particularly in vulnerable regions.</p>



<p>Obviously, Putin’s actions have been at the core and the thing from which you can draw a direct line to all of the vulnerability that we’re seeing around the world, in terms of food security.</p>



<p>His actions have strangled food and agriculture production, have used food as a weapon of war, including through the destruction of agricultural storage, processing, and testing facilities; the theft of grain and farm equipment; and the effective blockade of Black Sea ports.</p>



<p>Estimates suggest that up to 40 million people could be pushed into poverty in 2022 as a result of Putin’s war in Ukraine and its secondary effects, most especially around food security around the globe.&nbsp; This is just one piece of our efforts, and we are committed to do everything we can both as the United States and the G7 to work with partners around the world to address this.</p>



<p>Secondly, the G7 has also had very productive set of conversations on China and other 21st century challenges.&nbsp; Some examples, I think, you’ll see in the communiqué when it’s released today.</p>



<p>One, you’ll see leaders release a collective statement, which is unprecedented in the context of the G7, acknowledging the harms caused by China’s non-transparent, market-distorting industrial directives.&nbsp; The leaders will commit to working together to develop a coordinated approach to remedy China’s non-market practices to help ensure a level playing field for businesses and workers.</p>



<p>Leaders will also speak to China’s role in leaving, in particular, low- and middle-income countries in debt traps.&nbsp; That’s also a first for the G7.</p>



<p>And the G7 will commit to accelerate progress to tackle forced labor, with the goal of removing all forms of forced labor from global supply chains, including state-sponsored forced labor, such as in Xinjiang.&nbsp; We will commit to take further measures to strengthen cooperation, including through increased transparency and other measures to address forced labor globally.</p>



<p>The final G7 communiqué will be out later today, around the time the President heads to Spain for NATO.&nbsp; A consistent theme that will carry over from the G7 to NATO is our commitment not just to the transatlantic alliance but also to our focus on the Indo-Pacific.</p>



<p>We believe that these two are linked, as you saw with Japan at the G7 launching the infrastructure partnership, joining our aggressive sanctions, and the G7 coming together to call out harmful practices of China that impact Europe and the Indo-Pacific.</p>



<p>President Biden looks forward to seeing Indo-Pacific leaders at NATO for the first time, including when he will attend a trilateral meeting with President Yoon of the Republic of Korea and Prime Minister Kishida of Japan to follow up on their conversations in Seoul and Tokyo last month and confer on issues related to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.</p>



<p>There will be a lot more to come on the NATO trip.&nbsp; And I’m happy now to take a few questions.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; If anyone has any questions, could you please raise your hand?</p>



<p>All right.&nbsp; Let’s go to Shannon Pettypiece from NBC, please.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi.&nbsp; On the food security announcement &#8212; just real quick &#8212; over what time period is that funding for?&nbsp; And where would that money be coming from?</p>



<p>And also around the food issue, have there been any discussions among the leaders about trying to get the grain out of Ukraine using, like, an intermediary country?&nbsp; I know there was talk about that before the meeting.&nbsp; Has that come up &#8212; like any proposed ideas about getting the grain stuck in Ukraine out?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; So, with respect to the commitment from the United States and the President, that $2.76 billion comes from the second Ukraine supplemental.&nbsp; That is money that will be allocated and delivered before the end of this fiscal year.&nbsp; So it&#8217;s new money.&nbsp; It&#8217;s meant for immediate action.&nbsp; And those are new commitments from the United States to address the food security challenge.</p>



<p>To your second point, obviously, getting grain out of Ukraine to global markets is at the very top of the list of priorities that leaders have, with respect to addressing the food security challenge.</p>



<p>Obviously, Ukraine is a extremely important global grain producer and exporter, and the shortfalls in global markets as a result of Ukraine&#8217;s grain not being on global markets, and indeed those pressures even becoming more acute as Ukraine reaches harvest season, are, if anything, increasing the focus that G7 leaders have on this issue.</p>



<p>I think it&#8217;s fair to say that leaders were focused on discussing a range of approaches to addressing the issue of how to get &#8212; how to facilitate Ukraine&#8217;s grain to global markets.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have anything specific to add in terms of particular pathways or routes and assessments of them.</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; All right.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s do Paolo Mastrolilli, please.&nbsp; Can you ask your question?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Thank you very much for the briefing.&nbsp; I would like to ask if after the price cap on oil is the U.S. willing to consider also a price cap for Russian natural gas?&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; So the U.S. focus has been on oil.&nbsp; You know, I think that our belief is that this is a step that G7 leaders can take right now to get aligned around a set of objectives that&#8217;s going to both limit Putin&#8217;s revenues and squeeze the resources that he has to wage war and, secondly, to increase stability and the security of supply in global oil markets.</p>



<p>Leaders &#8212; I think you&#8217;ll see in the communiqué later today &#8212; are going to task ministers to work urgently towards developing &#8212; consulting with third countries and the private sector in an effort to develop a price cap around oil.&nbsp; And we look forward to the work that ministers do urgently in the days, weeks ahead.</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; All right, let&#8217;s do our last question to Jessica Ni, please.&nbsp; Could you ask your question?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Thank you for doing this.&nbsp; Last year, the communiqué had some language on peace and security in Taiwan Strait.&nbsp; Just wondering, would there be the same this year?&nbsp; And also, about the language on China, can we expect it to be stronger than last year or just about the same?&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Thanks for that question.&nbsp; I think that you will see very similar language in this year&#8217;s communiqué around the Indo-Pacific, including the Taiwan Strait. And secondly, with respect to the language on China, the economic practices, forced-labor practices, debt sustainability and China&#8217;s role in hampering efforts to enhance debt sustainability for lower-income countries, I think you&#8217;re going to see material steps forward across each of those dimensions versus the G7 statement last year, which was unprecedented in its own right by virtue of calling out China&#8217;s economic behavior for the first time at the G7 level.</p>



<p>So, yeah, I expect, across each of those dimensions relative to last year, to see some steps forward.</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; Thanks, everyone, for joining.&nbsp; As a reminder: call was on background, attributable to a “senior administration official,” and the embargo lifts after this call ends.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Biden-Harris Administration is Driving a Multi-Pronged Response to Global Food Security Crisis</em></p>



<p>President Biden and G7 leaders will announce that they will contribute over $4.5 billion to address global food security, over half of which will come from the United States. President Biden will announce $2.76 billion in additional U.S. Government funding commitments to help protect the world’s most vulnerable populations and mitigate the impacts of Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified war in Ukraine on growing food insecurity and malnutrition. These new investments will support efforts in&nbsp;over&nbsp;47&nbsp;countries and&nbsp;regional&nbsp;organizations, to support regional plans to address increasing needs.</p>



<p>Vladimir Putin’s actions have strangled food and agriculture production and have used food as a weapon of war, including through the destruction of agricultural storage, processing, and testing facilities; theft of grain and farm equipment; and the effective blockade of Black Sea ports. Russia’s choice to attack food supplies and production have an impact on markets, storage, production, negatively impacting consumers around the globe. Putin’s aggression in Ukraine, combined with the impacts from COVID-19, increasing conflict, high prices for fuel and fertilizer, have combined to devastate already fragile global food security and nutrition. Millions of people living far from the conflict face an increased risk of poverty, hunger, and malnutrition as a result of Putin’s war. Estimates suggest that up to 40 million more people could be pushed into poverty in 2022 as a result of Putin’s war in Ukraine and its secondary effects.<br><br>While the entire globe will continue to be affected by Russia’s actions, the most immediate needs will present in the Horn of Africa, as it experiences a record-setting fourth straight season of drought, that may lead to famine. As many as 20 million people may face the threat of starvation by the end of the year. The prolonged drought is also having dire nutrition impacts, putting children at severe risk of malnutrition and in need of treatment.<br><br>To address and mitigate further impacts on global food security, the U.S. Government will continue life-saving food assistance to address these growing needs and leverage additional financial commitments. Of the newly announced commitment of an additional $2.76 billion in humanitarian and economic assistance, $2 billion will be to help save lives through emergency interventions and $760 million will be for sustainable near-term food assistance to help mitigate further increases in poverty, hunger, and malnutrition in vulnerable countries impacted by high prices of food, fertilizer, and fuel.  <br><br><strong>The U.S. government’s multi-pronged response to combat global food insecurity includes:</strong><br><br><strong><em>Global Humanitarian Assistance</em></strong><br>Since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February, the United States has provided $2.8 billion to scale up emergency food operations in countries impacted by the food security crisis<em>.</em> In addition to this funding, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is committing another $2 billion in international disaster assistance (IDA) funds for emergency humanitarian needs over the next three months. These funds include direct food assistance, as well as related health, nutrition, protection, and water, sanitation and hygiene services, in countries with high levels of acute food insecurity, reliance on Russian or Ukrainian imports, and vulnerability to price shocks, and will support countries hosting refugee populations.<br><br><strong><em>Global Development Assistance</em></strong><br>As we continue to address acute humanitarian needs, the U.S. government will continue to strengthen food systems and mitigate medium-term impacts on food security. The U.S. Government is investing $760 million to combat the effects of high food, fuel, and fertilizer prices &#8211; now being driven up by Putin’s war &#8211; in those countries that need it most.</p>



<ul><li>The United States, through USAID, will program $640 million to support bilateral targeted agriculture and food security programs to strengthen agricultural capacity and resilience in more than 40 of the most vulnerable countries ­– Ukraine, as well as across 24 countries and regions in Africa, 10 countries in Asia, 6 countries and regional presence in Latin American and the Caribbean, and 6 countries in the Middle East. These investments will tackle urgent global fertilizer shortages, purchase resilient seeds, mitigate price shortages for fertilizer, scale-up social safety nets for families suffering from hunger and malnutrition, and avert food and humanitarian crises in the most vulnerable countries. &nbsp;These solutions will be tailored to mitigate specific needs within specific contexts, driven by local solutions that can be scaled for maximum impact.<br></li><li>The United States will also undertake multilateral efforts to protect livelihoods and nutrition and help vulnerable countries build their resilience to shocks, including food price volatility, supply chain issues, climate impacts, and other stresses beyond the immediate term. Specifically, in working with Congress, the United States will provide $120 million to the following efforts:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul><li>Support for the African Development Bank’s (AfDB) African Emergency Food Production Facility (AEFPF) to increase the production of climate-adapted wheat, corn, rice, and soybeans over the next four growing seasons in Africa.<br></li><li>Support for the International Fund for Agricultural Development’s (IFAD) Crisis Response Initiative (CRI) to help protect livelihoods and build resilience in rural communities.<br></li><li>Support for the Africa Adaptation Initiative (AAI) to develop a pipeline of bankable projects in Africa, to leverage private equity.<br></li><li>Support for the Africa Risk Capacity (ARC) Africa Disaster Risk Financing Programme (ADRiFi) to help African governments to respond to food system shocks by increasing access to risk insurance products.<br></li><li>A fertilizer efficiency and innovation program to enhance the efficiency of fertilizer use in countries where fertilizer tends to be overapplied.<br></li><li>Support for the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) will fund soil mapping spanning multiple countries to provide information allowing for wiser water usage, greater fertilizer conservation, and improved climate resilience impacts.</li></ul>



<p><strong><em>Expansion of Feed the Future</em></strong><br>Feed the Future (FTF), the U.S. government’s flagship global food security initiative led by USAID, is expanding its global footprint in eight new target countries from 12 to 20 target countries, in Africa that were also most vulnerable to the impacts of Russia’s war in Ukraine. The new target countries are the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Mozambique, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Zambia. This expansion of Feed the Future countries delivers on President Biden’s $5 billion commitment in September 2021 to end global hunger, malnutrition and build sustainable, resilient food systems abroad.<br><br>The U.S. government currently invests more than $1.9 billion per year through Feed the Future, which builds on existing technical expertise, programs and partners in more than 35 countries. In these countries, the U.S. government investments pave the way for further investments from the private sector, donors and local governments.<br><br><strong><em>Global Agriculture and Food Security Program (GAFSP)</em></strong><br>The United States through the U.S. Treasury, continues to exercise leadership in the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program (GAFSP) – a $2 billion multilateral financing mechanism that has helped the world’s poorest countries increase investments in agriculture and food security. The United States is contributing $155 million to support projects that raise agricultural productivity, link farmers to markets, improve livelihoods, reduce vulnerability, and enhance resilience to shocks. The United States is also newly serving as Co-Chair of the GAFSP Steering Committee. In this leadership position, the United States will help deepen and accelerate GAFSP’s response to the food security crisis.<br><br><strong>USG Leadership in Driving Global Action</strong><br>From the beginning, the United States has been at the forefront of global efforts to confront this crisis.</p>



<ul><li>The Department of the Treasury is also providing $500 million to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), which will help support the EBRD’s Resilience and Livelihood Framework.  This package of investments, expected to reach €2 billion over the next two years, will support businesses and public services across all sectors affected by the war in Ukraine and neighboring countries.  The funding will support Ukraine’s energy and food security needs; investing in improvements in municipal infrastructure to provide energy, water and wastewater services, and other needs, and supporting internally displaced persons.  The United States contribution is helping to mobilize an additional $500 million in support from other donors.   <br></li><li>In April, the Biden-Harris Administration announced that the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and USAID took the extraordinary step to draw down the full balance of the Bill Emerson Humanitarian Trust (BEHT) as part of an effort to provide $670 million in food assistance to countries in need as a result of Putin’s unprovoked further invasion of Ukraine. USDA will provide $388 million in funding through the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) to cover ocean freight transportation, inland transport, internal transport, shipping and handling, and other associated costs. USAID will use the BEHT’s $282 million to procure U.S. food commodities to bolster existing emergency food operations in six countries facing severe food insecurity: Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, Sudan, South Sudan, and Yemen.<br></li><li>In May, the United States chaired a Global Food Security Call to Action Ministerial and launched the Roadmap for Global Food Security &#8211; endorsed by 94 countries &#8211; which affirms a commitment to act with urgency, at scale, and in concert to respond to the urgent food security and nutrition needs of millions of people in vulnerable situations around the world. Ninety-four countries have endorsed the Roadmap and committed to provide immediate humanitarian assistance, build resilience of those in vulnerable situations, support social protection and safety nets, and strengthen sustainable, resilient, and inclusive food systems in line with the objectives of the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its Sustainable Development Goals, and the objectives of the 2021 UN Food Systems Summit. The United States also convened the UN Security Council during its May presidency to underscore the intersection of food insecurity and conflict, particularly in the context of Russia’s war in Ukraine, and to urge the international community to action.<br></li><li>In June, the United States, in coordination with partners, raised awareness of growing food insecurity at the World Trade Organization (WTO) 12th Ministerial Conference. Key outcomes included: a Ministerial Declaration on the Emergency Response to Food Insecurity, in which WTO Members committed to take concrete steps to facilitate trade and improve the functioning and long-term resilience of global markets for food and agriculture; and a Ministerial Decision in which Members agreed to exempt World Food Programme food purchases from export restrictions and prohibitions.</li></ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>Today President Biden met with G7 leaders to&nbsp;strengthen&nbsp;our cooperation on economic issues, cyberspace and quantum, and&nbsp;other 21<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;century&nbsp;challenges, including those&nbsp;posed by China&nbsp;to our workers, companies, and national security.&nbsp;The G7, representing over 50% of the world economy, is demonstrating that it is among the most potent institutions in the world today, with like-minded democracies solving problems. &nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Committing to a unified approach to confront China’s unfair economic practices</strong><strong>:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;The G7 will release collective, unprecedented language acknowledging the harms caused by the People’s Republic of China’s (PRC) non-transparent, market-distorting industrial directives. They will commit to working together to develop a coordinated approach to remedy the PRC’s non-market policies and practices to ensure a level playing field for businesses and workers.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Elevating supply chain resilience</strong><strong>:</strong>&nbsp;The G7 will share insights and best practices to identify, monitor, and minimize vulnerabilities and logistic bottlenecks in advance of supply chain shocks, as well as coordinate on long-term risk that undermine global security and stability. The G7 will make a commitment to&nbsp;intensify&nbsp;development of&nbsp;responsible, sustainable, and transparent&nbsp;critical minerals supply chains and establish a forward strategy that takes into account processing, refining and recycling.</p>



<p><strong>Cooperating on Cyber and Quantum&nbsp;</strong><strong>Technolog</strong><strong>y:</strong>&nbsp;The G7 will make a commitment to intensify and elevate our cyber cooperation; working with our close partners to achieveaccountability and increasing stability and security in cyberspace. The G7 will also commit to new cooperation to deploy quantum resistant cryptography with the goal of ensuring secure interoperability between ICT systems and fostering growth in the digital economy.</p>



<p><strong>Advancing</strong><strong>&nbsp;Trade and Technology Council standards for democratic, market-oriented approaches to trade</strong><strong>:</strong>&nbsp;The G7 will include a commitment to&nbsp;standards in technology, trade and innovation&nbsp;that represent our values as G7 partners compete with China.&nbsp;Through fora, such as the&nbsp;U.S.-EU&nbsp;Trade and Technology Council, we will demonstrate to the world how democratic and market-oriented approaches to trade, technology, and innovation can improve the lives of our citizens and be a force for greater prosperity. &nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Improving the multilateral framework for debt restructuring</strong><strong>:</strong>&nbsp;The G7 will underscore its commitment to successfully implementing the G20 Common Framework for Debt Treatments beyond the Debt Service Suspension Initiative. The G7 will urge all relevant creditors, including non-Paris Club countries – such as China – and private creditors, to contribute constructively to the necessary debt treatments as requested. The G7 will also reaffirm its commitment to promoting transparency across all debtors and creditors for improved debt sustainability.</p>



<p><strong>Committing to tackle f</strong><strong>orced&nbsp;</strong><strong>l</strong><strong>abor</strong><strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</strong><strong>upholding</strong><strong>&nbsp;human rights</strong><strong>:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;The G7&nbsp;will&nbsp;condemn&nbsp;a range of human rights abuses occurring globally, including abuses linked to&nbsp;Russia’s further invasion of Ukraine,&nbsp;the&nbsp;PRC’s repression in Xinjiang and Tibet,the military coup in Burma,&nbsp;and&nbsp;ongoing suppression of freedom in Iran.&nbsp;&nbsp;The G7&nbsp;will&nbsp;also&nbsp;commitd&nbsp;to&nbsp;accelerate progress to&nbsp;tackle forced labor,&nbsp;with the goal of removing all forms of forced labor from global supply chains, including state-sponsored forced labor, such as in Xinjiang. G7 countries&nbsp;committed&nbsp;to take&nbsp;further&nbsp;measures to strengthen cooperation, including through increased transparency and business risk advisories, and other measures to address forced labor globally.As one important example of action to combat forced labor in the PRC, the United States is implementing the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which President Biden signed into law in December 2021.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Reaffirming the Importance of Democratic Resilience:</strong>  The G7 Leaders – along with the leaders of Argentina, India, Indonesia, Senegal, and South Africa – released a <a href="https://www.g7germany.de/resource/blob/974430/2057608/61edf594f5ca30fb7b2ae4b79d16f1e6/2022-06-27-g7-resilient-democracies-statement-data.pdf?download=1">statement</a> on Democratic Resilience, affirming the importance of strengthening resilience to authoritarian threats within our own democracies and around the world. This Statement will amplify the shared democratic values across G7 countries; condemn Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as an attack on democracy; affirm the importance of civil society and independent media; and outline how G7 members will strengthen actions in response to rising foreign threats related to illicit finance and corruption, foreign malign influence, and transnational repression.</p>

<p>On July 5, 2022, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. will award the Medal of Honor to four U.S. Army Soldiers who fought in the Vietnam War:&nbsp; Staff Sergeant Edward N. Kaneshiro (posthumous), Specialist Five Dwight W. Birdwell, Specialist Five Dennis M. Fujii, and retired Major John J. Duffy.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Staff Sergeant Edward N. Kaneshiro will receive the Medal of Honor posthumously for acts of gallantry and intrepidity above and beyond the call of duty while serving as an infantry squad leader with Troop C, 1st Squadron, 9th Cavalry, 1st Cavalry Division, near Phu Huu 2, Kim Son Valley, Republic of Vietnam, on Dec. 1, 1966.&nbsp; Staff Sergeant Kaneshiro and his team entered the village of Phu Huu 2 while on a search and destroy mission and were attacked by North Vietnamese.&nbsp; Staff Sergeant Kaneshiro destroyed one enemy group with rifle fire and two others with grenades, which enabled the orderly extrication and reorganization of the platoon and ultimately led to a successful withdrawal from the village.&nbsp; He served in Vietnam between July 18, 1966, until his death on March 6, 1967, as a result of a hostile gunshot wound.<br><br>Specialist Five Dwight W. Birdwell will receive the Medal of Honor for acts of gallantry and intrepidity above and beyond the call of duty while serving with Troop C, 3rd Squadron, 4th Cavalry, 25th Infantry Division, in the Republic of Vietnam on January 31, 1968.&nbsp; That day, a large enemy element initiated an assault on the Tan Son Nhut Airbase near Saigon.&nbsp; They disabled or destroyed many of the unit’s vehicles and incapacitated Specialist Five Birdwell&#8217;s tank commander.&nbsp; Under heavy enemy small-arms fire, Specialist Five Birdwell moved the tank commander to safety and fired the tank&#8217;s weapons at the enemy force.&nbsp; Afterwards, he dismounted and continued fighting until receiving enemy fire to his face and torso.&nbsp; He refused evacuation and led a small group of defenders to disrupt the enemy assault until reinforcements arrived.&nbsp; He then aided in evacuating the wounded until he was ordered to seek attention for his own wounds.&nbsp; He was honorably discharged on December 29, 1968, and today practices law in Oklahoma City.<br><br>Specialist Five Dennis M. Fujii will receive the Medal of Honor for acts of gallantry and intrepidity above and beyond the call of duty while serving as crew chief aboard a helicopter ambulance during rescue operations in Laos and the Republic of Vietnam from February 18 &#8211; 22, 1971.&nbsp; During a mission to evacuate seriously wounded Vietnamese military personnel, Specialist Five Fujii&#8217;s medevac helicopter took on enemy fire and was forced to crash land.&nbsp; Although injured, he waved off a rescue from another helicopter and remained behind as the only American on the battlefield.&nbsp; During that night and the next day, although wounded, he administered first aid to allied casualties. On the night of February 19, he called in American helicopter gunships to assist in repelling an enemy attack.&nbsp; For more than 17 hours, he repeatedly exposed himself to hostile fire as he left the security of his entrenchment to better observe enemy troop positions and to direct air strikes against them until an American helicopter could attempt to airlift him from the area.&nbsp; Upon completion of his tour, he joined the Army Reserve and today resides in Hawaii.<br><br>Major John J. Duffy will receive the Medal of Honor for acts of gallantry and intrepidity above and beyond the call of duty while serving as the senior advisor to the 11th Airborne Battalion, 2nd Brigade, Airborne Division, Army of the Republic of Vietnam, from April 14 &#8211; 15, 1972.&nbsp; Two days earlier, the commander of the 11th Airborne Battalion had been killed, the battalion command post destroyed, and Major Duffy was twice wounded.&nbsp; He refused to be evacuated.&nbsp; In the morning hours of April 14, after a failed effort to establish a landing zone for resupply aircraft, he moved close to enemy anti-aircraft positions to call in airstrikes and was wounded again, but still refused evacuation. &nbsp;In the late afternoon, the enemy began a ground assault from all sides, and Major Duffy moved from position to position to adjust fire, spot targets for artillery and direct gunship fire.&nbsp; In the early morning of April 15, after an enemy ambush, he led evacuees, many of whom were seriously wounded, to an evacuation area, where he directed gunship fire on enemy positions and marked a landing zone for the helicopters. Only after ensuring all evacuees were aboard, did he board as well, assisting a wounded friendly foreign soldier and administering aid to a wounded helicopter door gunner. Major Duffy&#8217;s service included three tours in Vietnam in a myriad of Special Forces assignments.&nbsp; He retired from the Army on May 31, 1977, and currently lives in Santa Cruz, California.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><strong>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE MEDAL OF HONOR</strong>:<br><br>The Medal of Honor is awarded to members of the armed forces who distinguish themselves conspicuously by gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of their own lives above and beyond the call of duty while:</p>



<ul><li>engaged in an action against an enemy of the United States;</li><li>engaged in military operations involving conflict with an opposing foreign force; or</li><li>serving with friendly foreign forces engaged in an armed conflict against an opposing armed force in which the United States is not a belligerent party.</li></ul>



<p>The meritorious conduct must involve great personal bravery or self-sacrifice so conspicuous as to clearly distinguish the individual above his or her comrades and must have involved risk of life.&nbsp; There must be incontestable proof of the performance of the meritorious conduct, and each recommendation for the award must be considered on the standard of extraordinary merit.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Via Teleconference</p>



<p>1:42 P.M. EDT</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Good afternoon, everyone.&nbsp; We appreciate your patience with us as we’re running a few minutes behind.&nbsp; Today we’ll have a few speakers discuss the National Security Memorandum on Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated Fishing and Other Harmful Practices that the President signed this morning.</p>



<p>As a reminder, this call is on background, attributable to “senior administration officials,” but the embargo has now been moved up to the conclusion of this call.</p>



<p>For your awareness, not for your reporting, the senior administration officials on this call are [senior administration official], [senior administration official], and [senior administration official].</p>



<p>With that, I will pass it off to [senior administration official].</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; Thank you all for joining for today’s call.&nbsp; Really appreciate your patience with us getting it started, and really look forward to sharing with you that, today, President Biden has signed a National Security Memorandum focused on illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing and associated labor abuses.</p>



<p>This is a great capstone to National Ocean Month.&nbsp; This is following the President’s proclamation of June to be National Ocean Month and a recognition of June 8th as World Ocean Day.</p>



<p>The White House began this month with a series of announcements of the new steps the administration is taking to conserve and restore the health and productivity of the ocean for the benefit of all Americans.&nbsp; And today is the kickoff of the U.N. Ocean Conference in Portugal, which is the time for us to really highlight the international components of our engagements around ocean conservation in particular.</p>



<p>Today, we&#8217;ll be sharing with you a bit more detail around what we&#8217;re doing to combat IUU fishing.&nbsp; Again, that&#8217;s illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>IUU fishing threatens the health and precious biodiversity of our oceans, which is also facing increasing threats posed by climate change, acidification, and human pollution.</p>



<p>Additionally, IUU fishing threatens the food security of coastal communities that may not have the capacity to combat these practices and otherwise prevent overfishing in their waters and depleting of resources.</p>



<p>IUU fishing can be interconnected with a web of other troubling security challenges and criminal activities such as trafficking in persons, forced labor, trade in illicit goods, wildlife trafficking, and other violations of law.&nbsp; Some states also encourage IUU fishing by associated vessels as a method of reinforcing unlawful maritime claims.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The U.S. is committed to combating IUU fishing globally, and the National Security Memorandum that the President signed today provides the U.S government with a defined set of actions to address the problem of IUU fishing, including IUU fishing committed by distant-water fishing fleets, and associated criminal activities, such as the use of force labor in the seafood supply chain.</p>



<p>The memorandum, as you&#8217;ll see, directs departments and agencies with a variety of engagement strategies, from increased coordination with diverse stakeholders from public and private and foreign and domestic, to address the challenges in a comprehensive, all-of-government way.&nbsp; It also uses the full range of existing conservation, labor, trade, economic, diplomatic, law enforcement, and national security authorities to address these challenges, and focuses around enhancing coordination and the use of existing tools and authorities to address the challenge of forced labor in the seafood supply chain.</p>



<p>Lastly, it also calls for increased access and diplomatic engagement around training and technical support of foreign partners to carry out engagements in combating this behavior in the fishing industry.</p>



<p>So with that, I am pleased to pass this over to my colleagues from State to share a bit more and then to NOAA.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Thanks very much, [senior administration official].&nbsp; And hello to everyone.&nbsp; My name is [senior administration official].&nbsp;</p>



<p>As [senior administration official] was just mentioning, the elements related to combating IUU fishing on the National Security Memorandum that was signed today by the President include diplomatic engagements.</p>



<p>The United States is one of the largest seafood markets.&nbsp; We have one of the largest exclusive economic zones and waters under our jurisdiction in the world.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re also a fishing country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But we cannot combat IUU fishing alone; it is a global problem.&nbsp; It is involved in the value chain that feeds not only the U.S. market but other important markets.&nbsp; And there are a lot of countries who have been working to combat IUU fishing themselves.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And we believe that one of the most important elements of our diplomatic engagement is to combine and partner with all of the countries that are engaged in this work to make sure that we are as successful as possible in addressing IUU fishing but also the related human rights, labor problems, and environmental impacts of IUU fishing.</p>



<p>And so we are very pleased this week to take advantage of the global focus on oceans at the U.N. Ocean Conference.&nbsp; And we will be launching an IUU Fishing Action Alliance to bring together countries to commit to a pledge to take urgent action against IUU fishing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This will help us in the international implementation of the actions outlined in the National Security Memorandum, and it will help us capitalize on the resources and commitment of other countries, whether they&#8217;re coastal states, flag states, market states, or all of the above; and really begin to generate increased transparency in terms of fishing operations, increased accountability of fishers to the international rules or the rules of their flag authorities, and to make sure that the seafood products that are coming into the U.S. market are caught in accordance with international rules and national rules.</p>



<p>So that&#8217;s one of the major actions we&#8217;ll be taking to begin immediately to bring together the diplomatic efforts necessary to ensure the National Security Memorandum is effectively implemented and does what it is intended to do.</p>



<p>So with that, I&#8217;ll turn things over to [senior administration official] to talk about some actions that NOAA will be taking as well.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Thank you, [senior administration official].&nbsp; Thank you, [senior administration official].</p>



<p>NOAA will be announcing two actions that help to achieve some of the objectives outlined in the National Security Memorandum.</p>



<p>First, today, NOAA is issuing a proposed rule which will enhance and strengthen its capabilities to combat IUU fishing and counter forced labor in the seafood supply chain by implementing several provisions under three different laws.</p>



<p>And I think the key &#8212; the key takeaway is that the &#8212;</p>



<p>what we will be able to do is we&#8217;re changing &#8212; well, we&#8217;re not changing, we are making our definition of IUU fishing consistent with that of the FAO&#8217;s, which will enable us in our comparability findings to both include forced labor and how we determine whether a country has comparable laws to ours, allowing the imports, and whether or not we identify fishing in waters under the jurisdiction of a nation without the permission of that nation or in violation of that nation&#8217;s laws and regulations.&nbsp; And so that will help us to prevent imports of those products into the United States.</p>



<p>I encourage you to look at the full spectrum of the proposed rule for a number of other provisions that are proposed here.</p>



<p>The second announcement that NOAA, together with the 21 agencies that comprise the IUU fishing interagency working group, is &#8212; we are announcing that we are finalizing a strategic &#8212; a five-year strategic plan.&nbsp; And in that strategic plan, we have identified a number of partners that we will be working directly with to combat IUU fishing on the ground.&nbsp; And those partners are Senegal, Ecuador, Panama, Taiwan, and Vietnam.</p>



<p>We’ll be doing capacity building in those countries, not because they are the primary offenders of IUU fishing, but because they have expressed a willingness to work with the United States to combat IUU fishing in their countries.</p>



<p>With that, I&#8217;ll turn it back over to [senior administration official] and the NSC.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Keely, can you remind us how to queue up questions, please?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, thanks for the call.&nbsp; Just so I&#8217;m clear, could you maybe reiterate or be a little more specific about what the mem- &#8212; memorandum directs the agencies to do?&nbsp;</p>



<p>And then, as a secondary question, I wonder how much of this is due to concerns about Chinese illegal fishing.&nbsp; And, I mean, China says that it&#8217;s a responsible fishing nation, but how would you characterize China&#8217;s behavior in this area?&nbsp; And has the U.S. ever broached negotiations with China over these issues?&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; Thank you for that question.&nbsp; So, with additional specificity, the NSM directs departments and agencies to work toward ending human trafficking, including forced labor and IUU fishing, while promoting sustainable use of the ocean in partnership with other nations and the private sector, and advance foreign and trade policies for the benefit of American workers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And specifically, it&#8217;s asking departments and agencies to increase the coordination with diverse stakeholders, as I mentioned earlier, to use that full range of tools that I mentioned earlier to you as well, but also to do things like: investigate fishing vessels and operators suspected to be harvesting seafood with forced labor and issue with hold release orders as appropriate; to increase our engagement with key private sector and foreign partners, including by providing training and technical support to these partners; and to carry out research on labor practices in the seafood industry through Department of Labor, for instance, to coordinate more closely with the Department of Defense, the Coast Guard, and other enforcement agencies as well.</p>



<p>Specific to your question about China and our engagements there: The National Security Memorandum is not about any one specific country.&nbsp; All fishing nations, including those with distant-water fishing fleets, carry a range of flag-state responsibilities including monitoring their fleets and enforcing rules to prevent their vessels from engaging in IUU fishing.</p>



<p>It is also critical that all flag states, including the PRC, fully accept and implement their responsibilities to prevent and deter IUU fishing, and ensures sustainable conservation and management of our fishery resources.</p>



<p>The PRC is a leading contributor to IUU fishing worldwide, and it has impeded progress on the development of measures to combat IUU fishing and overfishing in international organizations.&nbsp; And the PRC has a responsibility to uphold these commitments as a flag state and actively monitor and correct the activities of fishing fleet activities in other countries’ waters &#8212; of its fleet fishing activities in other countries’ waters, including preventing its vessels from fishing outside coastal states’ license agreements or without a license to fish at all.</p>



<p>The U.S. has engaged bilaterally with the PRC to identify concerns about IUU fishing, to promote the PRC’s full implementation of flag-state responsibilities, and encourage the PRC’s improved implementation of international measures and in cooperation with agreements like the Port State Measures Agreement that now &#8212; that [senior administration official] mentioned briefly about PSMA.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We also call on the PRC to fulfill its pledge and actively participating in and support the international community in fighting against IU fishing.</p>



<p>Thanks so much for the question.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, thanks for doing this call.&nbsp; I had just some basic nuts-and-bolts questions.&nbsp; Is this the first time there&#8217;s been a national security memo on IUU fishing?&nbsp; And I also was hoping that the representative from NOAA could explain the first measure &#8212; the first action that they&#8217;re taking today in a little bit more detail.&nbsp; It kind of was a little bit confusing to me, and maybe she could walk us through that.</p>



<p>And then, I also just wanted to know &#8212; I didn&#8217;t get a chance to read through the entire memo, but the complaint that I often hear is that there is not enough resources and not enough agents actually, you know, working on these problems inside NOAA, inside CBP to enforce the laws that already are on the books.&nbsp; So, I&#8217;m wondering if there&#8217;s any commitment from the Biden administration to increase hiring of people in this field.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; [Senior administration official], do you want to start?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; I can start.&nbsp; Thank you for that question.&nbsp; Let me go through the proposed rule and see if I can clarify a little bit more what I stated.</p>



<p>The proposed rule would strengthen NOAA’s ability to address IUU fishing activities when implementing the U.S. Moratorium Protection Act &#8212; a key engagement tool used to identify, consult with, and certify nations and entities whose fishing vessels are engaged in IUU fishing, bycatch of protected living marine resources, or shark catch on the high seas.&nbsp; What we&#8217;re talking about today is really focused on that first part &#8212; the fishing vessels engaged in IUU fishing.</p>



<p>Specifically, the rule proposes to broaden the scope of activities that NOAA can consider when identifying nations for IUU fishing to include, the first thing, fishing in waters under the jurisdiction of a nation without the permission of that nation or in violation of its laws and regulations.&nbsp; And the second piece is: fishing activities in waters beyond any national jurisdictions that involve the use of forced labor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, those are the key provisions that will &#8212; should the rule get finalized with those, would allow NOAA to find a country in violation of that and prevent those products from being imported into our market.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Thanks, [senior administration official].&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regarding your question on the NSM, this is the first time there’s been an NSM addressing IUU fishing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And regarding resources, we have been working closely with Congress to ensure there are adequate resources directed at addressing these key issues.&nbsp; And we’ll continue to work closely with Congress on the implementation of the memorandum.</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; And thank you to our speakers.&nbsp; And thank you for &#8212; you all for joining.&nbsp; Apologies, we have to cut this quick at 2:00.&nbsp; But as a reminder, the embargo now lifts.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Reach out with any other questions.</p>

<p>Today, President Joe Biden signed a National Security Memorandum (NSM) to address illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing and related harmful fishing practices. &nbsp;</p>



<p>IUU fishing is among the greatest threats to ocean health and is a significant cause of global overfishing, contributing to the collapse or decline of fisheries that are critical to the economic growth, food systems, and ecosystems of numerous countries around the world.&nbsp; Distant water fishing vessels, which engage in industrial-scale fishing operations on the high seas and in waters under other states’ jurisdictions, can be significant perpetrators of IUU fishing and related harmful fishing practices.&nbsp; IUU fishing often involves forced labor, human trafficking, and other crimes and human rights abuses.&nbsp; Left unchecked, IUU fishing and associated labor abuses undermine U.S. economic competitiveness, national security, fisheries sustainability, and the livelihoods and human rights of fishers around the world and will exacerbate the environmental and socioeconomic effects of climate change.</p>



<p>The Biden Administration will address IUU fishing by increasing coordination with diverse stakeholders — public and private, foreign and domestic.&nbsp; The United States Government will use the full range of existing conservation, labor, trade, economic, diplomatic, law enforcement, and national security authorities to address these challenges, including:</p>



<ul><li>Promoting labor rights, human rights, and fundamental freedoms through worker-centered trade policies and working to ensure that supply chains are free from forced labor, including by engaging with international institutions and trade partners to address forced labor and other abusive labor practices in IUU fishing;<br></li><li>Collaborating within international organizations, including regional bodies, and partnering with stakeholders from governments, civil society, and the private sector, to increase global attention on the challenges of IUU fishing, including by distant water fishing vessels, and related abusive labor practices, such as the use of forced labor in seafood supply chains; and<br></li><li>Combatting abuses and strengthening incentives for ethical behavior in the global seafood industry, including by limiting the market for products derived from IUU fishing, forced labor, or other abusive labor practices.</li></ul>



<p>The Biden-Harris Administration is also taking the following actions to combat IUU fishing, which will be announced throughout this week’s U.N. Ocean Conference.</p>



<ul><li>The United States, the UK, and Canada will launch an <strong>IUU Fishing Action Alliance</strong> aimed at increasing ambition and momentum in the fight against IUU fishing, including <strong>a pledge to take urgent action</strong> to improve the monitoring, control, and surveillance of fisheries, increase transparency in fishing fleets and in the seafood market, and build new partnerships that will hold bad actors accountable.<br></li><li>The <strong>U.S. Interagency Working Group on Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated Fishing</strong>, comprising 21 Federal agencies, will release its <em>National Five-Year Strategy for Combating Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated Fishing (2022-2026)</em> by the end of July.&nbsp; The strategy prioritizes the Working Group’s efforts to combat IUU fishing, curtail the global trade of IUU fish and fish products, and promote global maritime security, while working in partnership with other governments and authorities, the seafood industry, academia, and non-governmental stakeholders.&nbsp; The United States will engage with priority partners, including Ecuador, Panama, Senegal, Taiwan, and Vietnam.&nbsp; Information on the member agencies and activities of the Working Group can be found <a href="https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/us-interagency-working-group-iuu-fishing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here.<br></a></li><li>NOAA will also issue a <strong>proposed rule to enhance and strengthen its ability to address IUU fishing activities and combat forced labor in the seafood supply chain</strong>. &nbsp;Specifically, the rule will enhance NOAA’s ability to implement the Agreement on Port State Measures to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing and the High Seas Driftnet Fishing Moratorium Protection Act.&nbsp; The rule proposes to broaden the scope of activities that NOAA can consider when identifying nations that engage in IUU fishing to include fishing in waters under the jurisdiction of a nation, without the permission of that nation, or in violation of its laws and regulations.&nbsp; This will ensure consistency with the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization’s <em>International Plan of Action to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing</em>.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>These new actions build on President Biden’s proclamation declaring June as <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2022/05/31/a-proclamation-on-national-ocean-month-2022/">National Ocean Month</a> and key <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/06/08/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-celebrates-world-ocean-day-with-actions-to-conserve-americas-deepest-atlantic-canyon-cut-plastic-pollution-and-create-americas-first-ever-o/">announcements</a> the White House made earlier this month to conserve and restore the health and productivity of the ocean for the benefit of all Americans. &nbsp;These announcements included initiating the designation process for a new national marine sanctuary to conserve Hudson Canyon in the Atlantic Ocean, a phase out of the sale of single-use plastics in national parks and public lands, the launch of efforts to create America’s first-ever Ocean Climate Action Plan, and the launch of an initiative to center environmental justice in ocean science and technology activities and investments.</p>
