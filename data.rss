										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>Today, the United States and African Union (AU) – Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) renewed our partnership by signing an updated Memorandum of Cooperation (MOC) between His Excellency Moussa Faki Mahamat, Chairperson of the African Union Commission (AUC), and U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken. This strategic memorandum signifies a continued and expanded commitment to this partnership by outlining our shared priorities for the a safer, healthier, and more equitable future. Together, we will continue efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Agenda.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the February 2022 AU Heads of State Summit, a resolution was approved to elevate Africa CDC’s status to an autonomous health agency of the African Union – a recognition of its global and regional leadership during the COVID-19 pandemic, Ebola outbreaks, and many other health events. In its support to Member States, Africa CDC serves as a platform to share and exchange knowledge and lessons from public health interventions. Since our partnership officially began in 2015, the U.S. government and Africa CDC have worked together to combat some of the world’s most pressing crises, including Ebola and COVID-19. We have continued to build on our strong relationship through technical assistance, embedded experts and deployed staff to work alongside the organization, and funding to support Africa CDC activities and staffing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, we celebrate ongoing work and highlight&nbsp;key areas of future engagement, including:&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>National Public Health Institutes (NPHIs):&nbsp;</strong>National public health institutes (NPHIs) serve as a functional home for public health activities and the foundation of Africa CDC’s operating model. These science-based agencies monitor the population’s health and respond to disease outbreaks and other public health priorities. They provide leadership and coordination to focus on core public health functions, including surveillance, laboratory, workforce, and public health emergency management. There is natural synergy between Africa CDC and the United States in establishing NPHIs and strengthening their core functions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The United States has also supported Africa CDC’s three-tiered operational model by developing and strengthening NPHIs at the national level and at five Regional Collaborating Centers (RCCs). The RCCs help build capacity of, coordinate public health initiatives with, and coordinate resources among AU Member States. Current Africa CDC initiatives, in partnership with the United States, can address capacity needs of NPHIs, including surveillance networks, health information exchange, early warning systems, and development of testing and diagnostics capacity. Our partnership will help support Africa CDC’s ongoing efforts to expand health security throughout the continent, and help countries reach the goals and target of the Global Health Security Agenda.</p>



<p><strong>Public Health Workforce:&nbsp;</strong>The United States and Africa CDC share the perspective that the public health and healthcare workforce plays a critical role in strengthen health systems, including preparing for and responding to pandemics while continuing to address health needs. The United States works with Africa CDC in building Africa’s public health workforce through supporting global human resources for health, expanding the Field Epidemiology Training Program (FETP), and partnering with Africa CDC’s Institute for Workforce Development (IWD) on other capacity building efforts.</p>



<p><strong>COVID-19:</strong>&nbsp;As part of President Biden’s commitment to leading an international and coordinated vaccine effort, the United States has shared over 166 million COVID-19 vaccine doses with 48 countries in Africa, as of February 2022, with plans for sending more.&nbsp;&nbsp;Africa CDC, in partnership with the African Union, the African Vaccine Acquisition Trust and COVAX, has helped guide allocations of those doses. The United States is supporting updates to regulatory structures and is facilitating engagement with private sector and international organizations that will help expand vaccine manufacturing and enable African public health institutions to produce and supply vaccines for the continent. The U.S. government has partnered with Africa CDC to enhance surveillance and laboratory capacity to identify, detect, and respond to COVID-19 outbreaks and variants of concern. The United States has also deployed staff to support and collaborate with Africa CDC in its leadership of COVID-19 response in Africa.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Critical Medical Commodities:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the United States Government’s Initiative for Global Vaccine Access (Global VAX), we are expanding efforts to work with international partners like Africa CDC to support infrastructure and capacity in vaccine delivery. While we currently work together on COVID-19 vaccine development, these efforts lay the foundation for accelerating the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and other critical medicals tools for a range of diseases.&nbsp;&nbsp;This complements existing work and technical partnerships across Africa for similar efforts to meet immediate and long-term health needs.</p>



<p><strong>Advanced Molecular Detection</strong>: Advanced technologies such as next-generation sequencing and bioinformatics are essential public health tools to help prevent and respond to emerging health threats. Genomics is an increasingly important tool in emerging potential in global public health. The United States, Africa CDC, and other partners have worked together to launch Africa CDC&#8217;s Pathogen Genomics initiative to strengthen laboratory systems and enhance disease surveillance by equipping the continent’s public health institutions with the tools, training, and data infrastructure to fully leverage critical genomic sequencing technologies.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>We the Leaders of the Group of Seven (G7) remain resolved to stand with the Ukrainian people and government who heroically resist Russian President Vladimir Putin’s military aggression and war of choice against their sovereign nation. This unprovoked and unjustified attack is causing enormous suffering and a tragic loss of life, including through the increasingly indiscriminate bombing and shelling of civilians in schools, homes, and hospitals.</p>



<p>We are united in our determination to hold President Putin and his regime accountable for this unjustified and unprovoked war that has already isolated Russia in the world. The world should join together in calling on President Putin and his regime to immediately stop its ongoing assault against Ukraine and withdraw its military forces. We stand in solidarity with those who are bravely opposing the invasion of Ukraine.</p>



<p>We urge Russia to ensure safe and unhindered humanitarian access to victims of its assault in Ukraine, and to allow safe passage for civilians wishing to leave. We call for, and commit to provide, humanitarian, medical and financial support to refugees from Ukraine.</p>



<p>Since President Putin launched the Russian Federation’s invasion on February 24, our countries have imposed expansive restrictive measures that have severely compromised Russia’s economy and financial system, as evidenced by the massive market reactions. We have collectively isolated key Russian banks from the global financial system; blunted the Central Bank of Russia´s ability to utilise its foreign reserves; imposed sweeping export bans and controls that cut Russia off from our advanced technologies; and targeted the architects of this war, that is Russian President Vladimir Putin and his accomplices, as well as the Lukashenko regime in Belarus.</p>



<p>In addition to announced plans, we will make further efforts to reduce our reliance on Russian energy, while ensuring that we do so in an orderly fashion and in ways that provide time for the world to secure alternative and sustainable supplies. In addition, private sector companies are leaving Russia with unprecedented speed and solidarity. We stand with our companies that are seeking an orderly withdrawal from the Russian market.</p>



<p>We remain resolved to isolate Russia further from our economies and the international financial system. Consequently, we commit to taking further measures as soon as possible in the context of our ongoing response and consistent with our respective legal authorities and processes:</p>



<p>First, we will endeavor, consistent with our national processes, to take action that will deny Russia Most-Favoured-Nation status relating to key products.&nbsp;This will revoke important benefits of Russia’s membership of the World Trade Organization and ensure that the products of Russian companies no longer receive Most-Favoured-Nation treatment in our economies. We welcome the ongoing preparation of a statement by a broad coalition of WTO members, including the G7, announcing their revocation of Russia’s Most-Favoured-Nation status.</p>



<p>Second, we are working collectively to prevent Russia from obtaining financing from the leading multilateral financial institutions, including the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Russia cannot grossly violate international law and expect to benefit from being part of the international economic order. We welcome the IMF and World Bank Group’s rapid and ongoing efforts to get financial assistance to Ukraine. We also welcome the steps the OECD has taken to restrict Russia’s participation in relevant bodies.</p>



<p>Third, we commit to continuing our campaign of pressure against Russian elites, proxies and oligarchs close to President Putin and other architects of the war as well as their families and their enablers. We commend the work done by many of our governments to identify and freeze mobile and immobile assets belonging to sanctioned individuals and entities, and resolve to continue this campaign of pressure as a matter of priority. To that end, we have operationalised the task force announced on February 26, which will target the assets of Russian elites close to President Putin and the architects of his war. Our sanctions packages are carefully targeted so as not to impede the delivery of humanitarian assistance.</p>



<p>Fourth, we commit to maintaining the effectiveness of our restrictive measures, to cracking down on evasion and to closing loop-holes. Specifically, in addition to other measures planned to prevent evasion, we will ensure that the Russian state and elites, proxies and oligarchs cannot leverage digital assets as a means of evading or offsetting the impact of international sanctions, which will further limit their access to the global financial system. It is commonly understood that our current sanctions already cover crypto-assets. We commit to taking measures to better detect and interdict any illicit activity, and we will impose costs on illicit Russian actors using digital assets to enhance and transfer their wealth, consistent with our national processes.</p>



<p>Fifth, we are resolved to fighting off the Russian regime’s attempts to spread disinformation. We affirm and support the right of the Russian people to free and unbiased information.</p>



<p>Sixth, we stand ready to impose further restrictions on exports and imports of key goods and technologies on the Russian Federation, which aim at denying Russia revenues and at ensuring that our citizens are not underwriting President Putin’s war, consistent with national processes. We note that international companies are already withdrawing from the Russian market. We will make sure that the elites, proxies and oligarchs that support President Putin’s war are deprived of their access to luxury goods and assets. The elites who sustain Putin’s war machine should no longer be able to reap the gains of this system, squandering the resources of the Russian people.</p>



<p>Seventh, Russian entities directly or indirectly supporting the war should not have access to new debt and equity investments and other forms of international capital. Our citizens are united in the view that their savings and investments should not fund the companies that underpin Russia’s economy and war machine. We will continue working together to develop and implement measures that will further limit Russia’s ability to raise money internationally.</p>



<p>We stand united and in solidarity with our partners, including developing and emerging economies, which unjustly bear the cost and impact of this war, for which we hold President Putin, his regime and supporters, and the Lukashenko regime, fully responsible. Together, we will work to preserve stability of energy markets as well as food security globally as Russia’s invasion threatens Ukraine’s capacity to grow crops this year.</p>



<p>We continue to stand with the Ukrainian people and the Government of Ukraine. We will continue to evaluate the impacts of our measures, including on third countries, and are prepared to take further measures to hold President Putin and his regime accountable for his attack on Ukraine.</p>

<p>Today, President Biden and G7 Leaders from Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom as well as the European Union will announce new economic actions to hold Putin accountable for his continued assault on Ukraine and further isolate Russia from the global financial system. Each partner will implement actions consistent with their national processes.</p>



<p>These actions will collectively ramp up pressure on Putin and build on the unprecedented package of economic sanctions and export controls the United States and over 30 countries have already imposed on Russia. Today, the ruble is trading at its weakest level ever and is worth less than a penny; the Russian stock market is closed for the longest time in history; the Russian government’s credit rating has been downgraded to “junk” status, and we’re seeing a mass exodus from Russia by the private sector – the result of our historic, multilateral coordination and commitment to ensure that Putin’s war of choice is a strategic failure. Russia has now become a global economic and financial pariah. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Today’s announcements include:</p>



<p><strong>Revoking Russia’s Most-Favored Nation Status.&nbsp;</strong>President Biden will work closely with Congress to deny Russia the benefits of its WTO membership and ensure that Russian imports do not receive most favored nation treatment in our economy. The United States Congress has demonstrated bipartisan leadership to revoke Permanent Normal Trade Relations for Russia, and President Biden looks forward to signing a bill into law. Together with similar actions by the G7, following our respective national processes, this collective action by more than half of the global economy will deliver another serious economic blow to Russia.</p>



<p><strong>Denying Borrowing Privileges at Multilateral Financial Institutions.&nbsp;</strong>The G7 Leaders will agree to ensure Russia cannot obtain financing from the leading multilateral financial institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Russia cannot grossly violate international law and expect to benefit from being part of the international economic order.</p>



<p><strong>Full blocking Sanctions on Additional Russian Elites and their Family Members</strong>. This includes Yuri Kovalchuk, executives of banks we have sanctioned, and Duma members who sponsored legislation to recognize the so-called “Donetsk People’s Republic” and “Luhansk People’s Republic.” This action will follow up on multiple efforts, along with those of our allies and partners, to target Russian elites and their family members who are profiting from this war of choice, and cuts them off from the U.S. financial system, freezes any assets they hold in the United States and blocks their travel to the United States. We will work through the international task force announced on February 26 to pursue the ill-gotten gains of these elites.<br><br><strong>Ban Export of Luxury Goods to Russia.&nbsp;</strong>President Biden will sign an Executive Order (E.O) that will end the exportation of luxury items to any person located in the Russian Federation. This will ensure that U.S. persons are not providing luxury items, such as high end-watches, luxury vehicles, high-end apparel, high-end alcohol, jewelry, and other goods frequently purchased by Russian elites. The U.S. export value of the products covered by today’s luxury goods restrictions is nearly $550 million per year. The elites who sustain Putin’s war machine should no longer be able to reap the gains of this system and squander the resources of the Russian people.</p>



<p><strong>Ban U.S. Import of Goods from Several Signature Sectors of Russia’s Economy.&nbsp;</strong>President Biden’s E.O. will also prohibit the import of goods from several signature sectors of Russia’s economy – including seafood, spirits/vodka, and non-industrial diamonds. This will deny Russia more than $1 billion in export revenues and ensure U.S. citizens are not underwriting Putin’s war. The United States retains the authority to impose additional import bans as appropriate.</p>



<p><strong>New guidance by the Department of Treasury to Thwart Sanctions Evasion, including through Virtual Currency.</strong>&nbsp;The Department of the Treasury, through new guidance, will continue to make clear that Treasury’s expansive actions against Russia require all U.S. persons to comply with sanctions regulations regardless of whether a transaction is denominated in traditional fiat currency or virtual currency. Treasury is closely monitoring any efforts to circumvent or violate Russia-related sanctions, including through the use of virtual currency, and is committed to using its broad enforcement authorities to act against violations and to promote compliance. &nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Create the Authority to Ban New Investment in Any Sector of the Russian Federation Economy</strong>. President Biden has already banned new U.S. investments in the Russian energy sector. This E.O. will establish the legal authority for future investment restrictions in any sector of the Russian economy, as may be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, by a United States person.</p>

<p>On 7-8 March, the United Kingdom and United States held high-level consultations on the Indo-Pacific. The U.S. delegation was led by Indo-Pacific Coordinator Kurt Campbell and included representatives from the Department of State, Department of Defense, and National Security Council. The UK delegation was led by Deputy National Security Advisor David Quarrey and included representatives from across Her Majesty’s Government. Officials from both governments resolved to broaden and deepen their alignment and cooperation on and in the region. They welcomed growing coordination among allies and partners across the Atlantic and the Pacific. In particular, they noted unprecedented commitments from Indo-Pacific countries—including Japan, Australia, the Republic of Korea, New Zealand, and Singapore—to support Ukraine and to impose costs on Russia for its brutal and unprovoked attack. They also noted that these steps come at a time when the U.S., UK and European partners are enhancing their engagement with the Indo-Pacific and preparing to meet the challenge of systemic competition with China.</p>



<p>U.S. and UK officials committed to coordinate implementation of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Strategy and the UK’s Indo-Pacific tilt, as set out in its Integrated Review. They noted progress made on AUKUS and reaffirmed their commitment at the highest level to ensuring the delivery of conventionally-armed nuclear-powered submarines and other advanced capabilities to promote security and stability in the region. They agreed to pursue positive economic engagement in the Indo-Pacific, including through supporting just green transitions as part of the Clean Green Initiative and Build Back Better World agendas; to collaborate on critical and emerging technologies; to ensure economic security; and to oppose economic coercion. They reaffirmed the importance of the maintenance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. They also discussed Hong Kong. In the coming months, the U.S. and the UK will work together to invest in partnerships with the Pacific Islands; to support the centrality of ASEAN and to advance concrete cooperation with ASEAN and its member states; and to enhance ties with India.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>To reinforce their commitment and sustain it in the long term, the United States and the United Kingdom agreed to inaugurate a continuing dialogue on the Indo-Pacific. The dialogue will be led in the U.S. Government by the National Security Council and the Department of State and in Her Majesty’s Government by the National Security Secretariat and the Foreign, Commonwealth, and Development Office.</p>

<p>From its first day in office, the Biden-Harris Administration has made delivering equitable relief to hard-hit small businesses a top priority. The latest data show that the Administration’s focus has resulted in a stunning turnaround from the previous Administration.</p>



<p>The pandemic was devastating to America’s small businesses and by January 2021, thousands of small businesses had closed, the unemployment rate was at 6.4 percent, and millions of Americans remained out of the workforce. While Congress had appropriated billions in small business relief in 2020, mom and pop businesses and those owned by women and entrepreneurs of color too often had been shut out of earlier relief efforts in the prior Administration. An&nbsp;<a href="https://coronavirus.house.gov/sites/democrats.coronavirus.house.gov/files/PPP%20Report%20Final%20%283%29.pdf">October 2020 report</a>&nbsp;issued by the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis found that the prior Administration encouraged banks to limit their Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) lending to existing customers, which ultimately excluded many minority and women-owned businesses across the country. The subcommittee also noted that, under the prior Administration, the Small Business Administration (SBA) and Treasury Department failed to issue guidance prioritizing underserved markets.</p>



<p>This Administration has put equity at the heart of the delivery of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sba.gov/article/2022/jan/20/one-year-later-biden-harris-administration-sba-have-prioritized-equitable-recovery-centered">more than $450 billion in small business relief</a>&nbsp;since taking office. Within weeks of Inauguration,&nbsp;the Administration&nbsp;announced a number of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/02/22/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-increases-lending-to-small-businesses-in-need-announces-changes-to-ppp-to-further-promote-equitable-access-to-relief/">policy changes</a>&nbsp;to target the PPP to the smallest businesses and companies that have been left behind in previous relief efforts. Recent reports by the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-21-601.pdf">independent Government Accountability Office</a>&nbsp;and academics&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w29732?utm_campaign=ntwh&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=ntwg11">Robert Fairlie and Frank Fossen</a>&nbsp;found that&nbsp;<strong>Biden-Harris reforms to PPP helped result in a substantially higher share of loans going to small businesses in underserved communities, including communities of color.</strong></p>



<p>Specifically, the reforms helped:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Increase loans to small businesses in low to moderate income (LMI) communities by 62 percent.</strong>  In 2021, the PPP made 2 million loans to businesses located in LMI communities, a 62 percent increase from the 1.2 million loans made to businesses in these communities in 2020.</li><li><strong>Expand lending to the smallest businesses by 35 percent.</strong>  6 million businesses with less than 20 employees received PPP loans in 2021, a 35 percent increase from the 4.5 million loans made to these businesses in 2020. More than 95 percent of 2021 PPP loans went to these businesses.  </li><li><strong>Triple lending to microbusinesses.  </strong>Nearly two-thirds of 2021 PPP loans went to Schedule C businesses, providing roughly 4 million of the smallest businesses – 35 percent in LMI areas – with $60 billion in forgivable loans. This tripled the amount of funding from the roughly $20 billion that went to Schedule C businesses in 2020.   </li><li><strong>Reduce the average loan size by more than half</strong>.  Thanks to the SBA’s success in reaching smaller businesses than under the previous Administration, the average PPP loan size under the Biden-Harris Administration was $42.5K. This was down more than 50 percent from the $101.5K average in the 2020 round of PPP. This reduction in average loan demonstrates that PPP reached more of the smallest businesses under the Biden-Harris Administration.</li><li><strong>Increase loans to rural small businesses by 40 percent.</strong>  The number of PPP loans made to rural small businesses was up 40 percent from 2020, from 1 million in 2020 to 1.4 million loans made in 2021.</li><li><strong>Expand the number loans made by community financial institutions by a factor of 6.</strong>  The number of PPP loans made by community financial institutions and minority depository institutions increased from more than 240,000 loans in 2020 to nearly 1.4 million loans in 2021.  The loan volume nearly doubled, from $17.5 billion in 2020 to $29.9 billion in 2021 even as the overall size of the PPP program ($271 billion) decreased by nearly 50 percent from the $521 billion in loans made in 2020.  </li></ul>



<p>Overall, these changes ensured that the 2021 round of the PPP – which consisted of more than $271 billion in forgivable loans to nearly 6.4 million businesses – reached more of the smallest businesses and those located in low and moderate income (LMI) communities.</p>



<p>These efforts build upon the Biden-Administration’s overall efforts to help small businesses navigate the ups and downs of the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2021, the Administration distributed more than $450 billion in critical relief to more than 6 million small businesses through the Small Business Administration.&nbsp;In addition to PPP, this relief included:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>$28.5 billion to 100,000 restaurants, food trucks, street food vendors, breweries, and other food service businesses through the Restaurant Revitalization Fund.&nbsp;27 percent of these businesses were located in LMI areas and 15 percent were from rural communities.</li><li>Providing $14.2 billion in grants to nearly 13,000 theaters, live venues and other entertainment and cultural hubs.&nbsp; More than 90 percent of these grantees, or roughly 11,600, have 50 employees or less. These smallest of businesses received a total of $8.5 billion in awards.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Providing more than 600,000 of the small business hardest hit by the pandemic with more than $7.5 billion in small grants through the Targeted Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) Advance program. All of these businesses are located in LMI areas.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Providing more than $125 billion in low interest, long-term loans through the COVID EIDL program to more than 650,000 small businesses. Overall, 95 percent of COVID EIDL borrowers have less than 20 employees, nearly one-fourth were located in LMI areas, and 14 percent were in rural communities.</li></ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>On March 11, 2021 – one year ago today – President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan (ARP) Act into law, an unprecedented $1.9 trillion package of emergency assistance measures. The ARP provides a historic investment in America’s preschool through twelfth grade (P-12) schools in response to the COVID-19 pandemic to keep schools safely open, tackle learning loss and mental health. These funds include $122 billion for P-12 schools in Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ARP ESSER) funds. ARP also dedicated an additional $8 billion to states and school districts to meet the needs of certain student populations, including over $3 billion for students with disabilities and $800 million for children and youth experiencing homelessness.<br><br>ARP has already had a significant impact on schools across the country: over the last year, states, school districts, and schools have used these funds to safely reopen and sustain in-person instruction, combat learning loss, and address students’ mental health needs.<br><br>In his State of the Union address last week, President Biden called on schools to hire more teachers, urged the American people to sign up to be tutors and mentors, and – as part of his unity agenda – encouraged the country to come together to address child mental health. ARP ESSER funds are supporting this agenda in several ways:</p>



<ul><li><strong><u>Schools have gone from 46% open before ARP to 99% safe and open today</u></strong><strong><u>:</u></strong> Before ARP was signed into law, just 46 percent of America’s P-12 schools were open for full-time, in-person learning. Today, over 99 percent of P-12 schools are open for full-time, in-person instruction.<br></li><li><strong><u>ARP led to record growth in local education jobs that are critical to meeting students’ academic and mental health needs</u></strong><strong><u>:</u></strong> Although there is more work to do to address longstanding educator shortages and return to pre-pandemic levels, ARP has led to record jobs growth in the education sector. With the help of ARP ESSER funding, local governments added more than 279,000 education jobs in 2021 – the best calendar year of jobs growth since records began in 1956 – and added an additional nearly 46,000 jobs in the first two months of 2022. Schools have already seen a 65% increase in social workers and a 17% increase in counselors relative to before the pandemic.<br></li><li><strong><u>Analysis of school district plans shows overwhelming majority of funds are being used for priorities like teachers, counselors, academic recovery, mental health, and health and safety measures like ventilation improvements: </u></strong>&nbsp;FutureEd – an education think tank at Georgetown University’s McCourt School of Public Policy – analyzed data on a representative sample of over 3,000 school districts’ plans covering 55% of ARP ESSER funds. This analysis showed:<ul><li>Nearly 60% of funds are being used to:<ul><li>invest in staffing – both retaining current staff and expanding professional development opportunities, as well as recruiting, hiring and training of new teachers, school staff and mental health professionals to increase school capacity and meet the academic and mental health needs of students;</li><li>combat learning loss through student support programs such as evidence-based tutoring, expanded after-school and summer learning and enrichment programs, and the purchase of millions of new textbooks and learning materials; and&nbsp;</li><li>supporting the physical and mental health of students and educators.</li></ul></li><li>Another 24% is being invested in keeping schools operating safely, including providing PPE and updating school facilities to support health and safety. This includes investments in lead abatement and an estimated nearly $10 billion for improvements to HVAC and ventilation.<br></li></ul></li><li><strong><u>ARP has fueled investments in education spending and accelerated the rate of spending of education relief funds by five to six times:</u></strong> Before the passage of ARP, states and school districts were spending a total of a little more than $500 million per month of federal emergency relief funds for education. Since the passage of the ARP and the assurance to states and school districts that critical funds were on their way, the monthly rate of spending of ESSER funds from ARP and earlier relief legislation has accelerated to more than $3 billion per month – an increase of five to six times.<br></li><li><strong><u>All 50 states submitted clear spending plans that have been approved by the U.S. Department of Education</u></strong>: On March 24, less than two weeks after ARP was signed, two-thirds of funds – $81 billion – were released. To ensure funds would be used effectively, states had to submit and receive approval on their spending plan to receive their final third of funds. As of December 2021, every state, plus DC and Puerto Rico, submitted a plan, the U.S. Department of Education has approved all plans, and all $122 billion in ARP ESSER funds have been made available to states.<br></li><li><strong><u>Survey of 600 school superintendents shows school leaders are meeting the challenge of the President’s unity agenda by using funds for students’ mental health and other developmental needs</u></strong><strong><u>:</u></strong> The COVID-19 pandemic has subjected many young Americans to social isolation, loss of routines, and traumatic grief – increasing the need for mental health supports. A recent survey by AASA, The School Superintendents Association, found that 82% of districts plan to use funds to address this need by expanding supports for social, emotional, mental, and physical health and development.<br></li><li><strong><u>States and school districts have deployed funds strategically while engaging meaningfully with their communities – including parents</u></strong><strong><u>:</u></strong> In developing their spending plans, states and school districts were required to engage members of the community, including parents, educators, students, representatives of students with disabilities and others. The U.S. Department of Education continues to encourage states and school districts to consult with these critical partners on how to ensure these funds have the most impact in classrooms.</li></ul>



<p><strong>ARP ESSER-Funded State and District Activities</strong><br><em>From the U.S. Department of Education</em><br><br><strong>Safely Reopening Schools and Sustaining Safe Operations</strong><br>Safely reopening schools and keeping them open safely are essential for student learning and well-being.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><strong>Houston Independent School District (HISD) </strong>in Texas has allocated ARP ESSER funds to campuses for COVID-19 mitigation efforts. HISD has provided COVID-19 testing at 90 percent of its campuses and has hosted nearly 100 vaccine clinics.<br></li><li>The <strong>DeKalb County School District</strong> in Georgia upgraded air filters from MERV 8 to MERV 13 in every school facility that could accommodate that size filter and took steps to improve ventilation in all other schools using ARP ESSER funding.<br></li><li><strong>White Plains City School District </strong>in New York will use a combination of local and federal funds to replace the HVAC units across their district to provide a safer learning environment for students and staff. Upon completion, the total project will cost $26.3 million, with nearly one-third of the funding coming from relief funds, including ARP ESSER.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Combating Learning Loss</strong><br>States and school districts have the resources they need, and are required to address the impacts of the pandemic on students’ learning. States and districts nationwide are using funds to hire teachers and other instructional staff, launch tutoring, summer and afterschool programs (which states are required to fund), and make long-overdue investments in instructional materials.&nbsp;States are specifically required to address the needs of students disproportionately impacted by the pandemic, including students with disabilities, English learners, and students experiencing homelessness.<br><br><strong><em>Recruiting, Retaining, and Expanding Professional Development of Staff:</em></strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>Maine School Administrative District 11</strong> is addressing gaps in learning opportunities by using ARP ESSER funds to hire nine new teachers and implement a new math, language arts, and social studies program. The additional teachers permitted the district to reduce class sizes from 22-24 students to an&nbsp;average of 14-16 students. The district has provided external and internal coaching, ongoing professional learning, and additional support to educators and staff.<br></li><li><strong>Gaston County Schools </strong>in North Carolina is adding an additional teacher and a temporary employee per school to decrease class sizes, help manage workloads and provide classroom coverage in each of its 54 schools using ARP ESSER funding. This supports and helps retain current teachers, who are less likely to have to give up planning time to cover another classroom, or combine classrooms, and also benefits students whose learning is less likely to be disrupted by the absence of another teacher.<br></li><li>The <strong>Asheville City Schools Board of Education</strong> in North Carolina is using ARP ESSER funds for a bonus of $3,000 to $3,500 over the course of the year for full-time teachers and faculty in order to increase staff retention.<br></li><li><strong>Providence Public School District in Rhode Island </strong>is launching new incentives to recruit and retain highly-qualified educators, including early signing bonuses for newly-hired educators and support staff in hard-to-fill positions using &nbsp;ARP ESSER funding.</li></ul>



<p><strong><em>Summer Learning and Enrichment:&nbsp;</em></strong></p>



<ul><li>In New Mexico, the College and Career Readiness Bureau of the <strong>New Mexico Public Education Department</strong> launched the Summer Enrichment Internship Program in 2021 using ARP ESSER funding. The program covers the cost of summer internships for New Mexico high school students and provides high school students, particularly those most impacted by the pandemic, with the opportunity to participate in high-quality internships in government agencies, including county, tribal, and municipal placements. Over 300 community partners and 1,200 student interns participated across 26 counties. Summer jobs programs like these that engage students are also important community violence intervention strategies. This program will continue in the summer of 2022 as well.<br></li><li><strong>Cleveland Metropolitan School District </strong>in Ohio used ARP ESSER funds to increase summer learning participation seven-fold. In 2021, 8,400 students participated in summer school, compared to 1,000-1,200 students in previous years. Focused on “Finish, Enrich, and Engage,” the expanded summer school offered 12 weeks of programming that allowed for credit accumulation and unfinished learning. Students engaged in problem-based learning units in the morning with engagement activities like clubs and sports in the afternoon. This inclusive programming, which included students with disabilities and multilingual learners, will continue in summer 2022.<br></li><li><strong>The Oklahoma State Department of Education</strong> is using ARP ESSER funds to implement evidence-based summer learning and enrichment programs and to expand afterschool programming through partnerships with community organizations. They provide for social, emotional, and academic support and access to technology. This initial investment of $6 million provided services through 28 organizations, at 140 sites, serving an average 11,000 students a month through the summer of 2021.</li></ul>



<p><strong><em>Tutoring:</em></strong></p>



<ul><li>The<strong> Arkansas Division of Elementary and Secondary Education</strong> has established the Arkansas Tutoring Corps using ARP ESSER funding. The Arkansas Tutoring Corps program includes recruitment, preparation, and support for candidates to become qualified tutors to provide instruction or intervention to meet the academic needs of students most impacted by lost instructional time. A system connects prepared candidates with organizations seeking to support students’ academic needs. The program is already enhancing learning experiences of students due to loss of instructional time and addressing gaps in foundational skills in mathematics and literacy.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Meeting Students’&nbsp;Social, Emotional, and Mental Health&nbsp;Needs</strong><br>Districts and states must use a portion of ARP ESSER funds for evidence-based interventions that respond to students’ social, and emotional needs – such as the ability to collaborate with others or persist through difficult challenges – and to support students’ mental health. Districts must specifically address the impact of the pandemic on groups of students that were disproportionately impacted.&nbsp;<br><br><strong><em>Hiring&nbsp;Counselors&nbsp;and Increasing Supports</em></strong><strong><em>:</em></strong></p>



<ul><li>The <strong>Kansas Department of Education</strong> has developed a Grow Your Own Counselor model with ARP ESSER funding that encourages districts to identify candidates and employ them as student services coordinators while they develop their skills in an approved school counseling graduate program.<br></li><li>The <strong>Nevada Department of Education</strong> has allocated $7.5 million to support districts in hiring 100 additional school based mental health professionals. Using ARP ESSER funding, the state is spending $1.7 million to hire a Multi-Tiered Systems of Support coach for every district.<br></li><li><strong>Plymouth-Canton Community Schools</strong> in Michigan hired three full-time high school counseling staff to decrease counselor caseloads with ARP ESSER funding. Counselors are now able to dedicate more time to individual student meetings, attend meetings with assistant principals and deans to review academic progress and other needs of students, and develop a wellness center at each campus.</li></ul>



<p><strong><em>Community Schools</em></strong><strong><em>:</em></strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>The New York City Department of Education </strong>announced an investment of $10 million to expand the district’s research-based community schools initiative from 266 to 406 sites citywide using ARP ESSER funding. These schools provide integrated student support services to students and the surrounding community, such as mental health care, adult education courses, community violence intervention programs, and nutrition support.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Strengthening the Educator Workforce</strong><br>The pandemic has taken a toll on the nation’s educators as well as its students. States and districts should support and stabilize the educator workforce and make staffing decisions that will help address students’ social, emotional, mental health, and academic needs.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>The<strong> Tennessee Department of Education</strong> has created a “Grow Your Own” grant with federal funding, including ARP ESSER, that is designed to foster partnerships between educator preparation programs (EPPs) and districts to provide promising and innovative, no-cost pathways to the teaching profession by increasing EPP enrollment and&nbsp;growing the&nbsp;supply of qualified teachers. The program is currently comprised of 65 partnerships between 14 EPPs and 63 districts across the state – enabling over 650 future educators to become a Tennessee teacher for free. $6.5 million has been allocated to this program thus far. Tennessee also pioneered a pathway with the U.S. Department of Labor by establishing the nation’s first registered apprenticeship program for teachers, which will help sustain the state’s Grow Your Own programs and partnerships leveraging federal apprenticeship funding. &nbsp;</li></ul>
