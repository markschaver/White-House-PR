<p class="has-text-align-center">James S. Brady Press Briefing Room</p>



<p>1:23 P.M. EDT</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: Hi, everyone. Okay, just a couple of items for you at the top. President Biden believes that the surge in gun violence and violent crime that has affected communities across the country over the last year and a half is unacceptable. That&#8217;s why his administration is moving decisively to act with a whole-of-government approach.&nbsp;<br><br>Today, the Biden-Harris administration is announcing a comprehensive strategy to combat violent crime and gun violence that targets the crime itself, implements preventative measures that are proven to reduce violent crime, and attacks root causes, including by addressing the flow of firearms used to commit crimes.<br><br>Combined, this plan will stem the flow of firearms used to commit violence, including by holding rogue firearm dealers accountable for violating federal laws; support local law enforcement with federal tools and resources to help address violent crime; invest in evidence-based community violence interventions; expand summer programming, employment opportunities, and other services and support for teenagers and young adults; and help formerly incarcerated individuals successfully reenter their communities.<br><br>One of the key elements of this strategy is helping state and local governments fight gun violence and violent crime in their communities through the historic funding levels in the American Rescue Plan.<br><br>Today&#8217;s strategy builds on that by providing further guidance for states and cities to expand their ability to improve public safety in their communities. And we&#8217;ve already seen examples of what is happening around the country. In Philadelphia, Mayor Kenney is using funding from ARP to address gun violence, reform and improve the police department, and invest in violent interruption programs.<br><br>In Albuquerque, Mayor Keller plans to spend $3 million to expand the city&#8217;s gunshot detection system, and millions more to recruit police officers and refurbish station houses.<br><br>In Akron, Ohio, Mayor Horrigan has proposed $20 million to reduce community and youth violence through employment training and opportunities, as well as recreation assets.<br><br>I&#8217;d also note, today &#8212; and obviously the President will speak to all of this later this afternoon &#8212; today, the Vice President will hold a listening session with leading civil rights and voting rights groups from across the country following the Senate vote on the For the People Act just yesterday.<br><br>The meeting builds on the Vice President&#8217;s work to bring together a national coalition on voting rights to promote voter registration and engagement &#8212; engagement among Americans across the country &#8212; from Greenville, South Carolina, to Atlanta, Georgia &#8212; to protect our fundamental right to vote.<br><br>She will drive the message that the fight is not over and that the President and the administration remain committed to ensuring that all Americans have access to the ballot.<br><br>Finally &#8212; I do have one more thing &#8212; tomorrow, the President will travel to Raleigh, North Carolina &#8212; some of you may be on that trip &#8212; as our administration continues to work to continue encouraging vaccinations across the country, ensuring every American knows just how to ensure it is easy to get vaccinated.<br><br>While he&#8217;s there, he will highlight the importance of getting vaccinated and kick off a community canvassing event at the Green Road Park Community Center in Raleigh.<br><br>He will also tour a mobile vaccination unit and meet with frontline workers and grassroots volunteers who are the boots on the ground working to get people in their communities vaccinated.<br><br>Alex, why don&#8217;t you kick us off?<br><br>Q &nbsp;Thanks, Jen. First off, the Vice President&#8217;s office just announced that she will be visiting the border Friday. What can you tell us about the visit? And you have, in the past, defended the decision not to visit the border by anyone, really, in the &#8212; by President Biden or Vice President Harris. So what’s behind the, sort of, change of course?&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI: Sure. First, I think many of you may have seen it, but just to reiterate the specific details &#8212; the Vice President will travel to El Paso, Texas, on Friday. She will be accompanied by Department of Homeland Security Secretary Ali Mayorkas.<br><br>Earlier this year, as you all know, the President asked the Vice President to oversee our diplomatic efforts to address the root causes of migration from El Salvador to Guatemala and Honduras. And, as a part of this work, she recently traveled to Guatemala and Mexico last month to have those discussions. And this trip to the border on Friday will be a part of this effort.<br><br>I will note that I&#8217;ve also said here, from this podium &#8212; and she has also said &#8212; that when it was the right time, she may go to visit the border. And so, this trip on Friday, which is being done in coordination with the Department of Homeland Security &#8212; Secretary Mayorkas is, of course, joining her on this trip, you know, and the planning and timing of it was done in coordination with them &#8212; is &#8212; is part of the coordinated effort between her office, her work, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Health and Human Services to continue to address the root causes and work in coordination to get the situation under control.<br><br>Q&nbsp; Sure. And then on voting rights: The President’s statement yesterday said he&#8217;ll have more to say on this next week.<br><br>MS. PSAKI: Mm-hmm.<br><br>Q&nbsp; Can you give us a sense of what we should expect from the President on voting rights? And you also have said that there are other avenues for protecting voting rights. What do those look like?<br><br>Then I&#8217;m going to take another stab at this &#8212; I know you&#8217;ve been asked this five different ways, but &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI: Okay.<br><br>Q&nbsp; &#8212; does the President believe that the filibuster is &#8212; defending the filibuster is worth more. and more important than protecting voting rights?<br><br>MS. PSAKI: Well, first, let me say &#8212; as the Vice President said yesterday and I&#8217;ll just reiterate &#8212; the fight to improve and expand access to voting is far from over. And the President, as he noted in his statement yesterday and as you just touched on, will be speaking to this next week. And this is a continuation of his efforts to use the bully pulpit to elevate this issue, as he did just last week when he marked Juneteenth, and also as he did in Tulsa, Oklahoma, just a few weeks before that.<br><br>So I expect you &#8212; we’ll have more to preview as we get closer. But I can tell you that what you should expect to hear from him is that there are many ways to work across the country &#8212; with activists, with states, with legislators &#8212; using every lever at our disposal to expand access, improve access to voting for people across the country.<br><br>He&#8217;ll talk about some of the ways that he wants to continue to do that. He&#8217;ll also reiterate his view that it&#8217;s a fundamental right and that people across the country should be able to exercise that to decide who they want to be their mayor, who they want to be their congressman, who they want to be their President. And everybody who supports democracy, who supports equality, who supports justice should be supporting improvements to our voting rights laws.<br><br>Q&nbsp; And one more last one on this conversation around crime.<br><br>MS. PSAKI: Mm-hmm.<br><br>Q&nbsp; How should the American people measure success for President Biden on crime? Should they be looking for a reduction in crime in their localities? Or, I mean, what exactly is he aiming for in announcing these new policies today?<br><br>MS. PSAKI: Well, that certainly is the goal, of course. But I would say, Alex, that what the President has watched closely is that there has been, of course, an increase in violent crime &#8212; gun violence, specifically, in a lot of communities &#8212; over the last 18 months.<br><br>He&#8217;s obviously taken a number of steps over the past couple of months to work to address that. This is a continuation of that in his view. And part of that is empowering local police communities and making sure that local communities have the funding they need to &#8212; to support efforts by the local police. It also means taking steps to address the prevalence of gun violence across the country.<br><br>So, of course, his objective is to take steps &#8212; steps he can do, as the President of the United States, using the tools he has at his disposal &#8212; to empower local communities, get them the resources they need, and ensure we&#8217;re putting laws in place that reduce gun violence.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp; Thanks, Jen. Can you tell us a little bit more about what the Vice President will be doing at the border? Is she visiting a detention center or a facility for migrant children? And how much access will the press have to whatever sites she tours while she’s there?<br><br>MS. PSAKI: They&#8217;re all great questions. Obviously, they just made this announcement. I&#8217;m sure they will have more details to share with you. I just don&#8217;t have any more to share with you at this particular moment on what she&#8217;ll be doing specifically there.<br><br>Q&nbsp; Okay. And then can you tell us a little bit more about this decision for the U.S. to seize website domains used by Iranian state TV? What led to that decision and why now?<br><br>MS. PSAKI: It&#8217;s a Department of Justice decision and action, so I would point you to them.<br><br>Q&nbsp; Is there any concern that this could hamper negotiations over Iran&#8217;s nuclear program?<br><br>MS. PSAKI: We are still at the point in those discussions &#8212; we just finished the sixth round. Obviously, all of the negotiators are back in their capitals, having discussions, as is appropriate.<br><br>We see advantage to us in moving toward a diplomatic solution. We hope others who have seats at the table do as well. But, again, this was an action by the Department of Justice, not &#8212; not coordinated with other aspects of our negotiations.<br><br>Q&nbsp; And then what can you tell us about the talks that took place on the Hill yesterday over the bipartisan infrastructure proposal? Were those fruitful discussions? And where does that go from here? Is the President going to be hosting any of those senators here at the White House in the coming days?<br><br>MS. PSAKI: If we continue to make progress in these discussions, then the President looks forward to welcoming members to the White House before the end of the week. We&#8217;ll see.<br><br>There were a couple rounds &#8212; there were two rounds of discussions yesterday. And I know you&#8217;re all aware of this &#8212; or many of you who cover this closely &#8212; but there was one in the afternoon; there was another one last night. Additional progress was made last night.<br><br>This afternoon, Steve Ricchetti, Louisa Terrell, Brian Deese are all back up on the Hill right about now having continued discussions about the path forward. That&#8217;s one track where we are moving forward on these bipartisan negotiations. And we assess, as we conclude each round, what the next step should be.<br><br>So, again, if we make progress and if we assess that &#8212; that it is the appropriate time to bring these officials &#8212; these elected officials to the White House, the President looks forward to doing that.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp; Thank you, Jen. So, about today&#8217;s announcement: Why is the Vice President visiting the border this week when, earlier this month, she dismissed a trip like that, saying it would be a “grand gesture”?<br><br>MS. PSAKI: She also said in an interview with NBC that she would be open to going to the border if it was an appropriate time. She said that after she said that, so that&#8217;s important context as well.<br><br>Q&nbsp; Okay. And, important context: I&#8217;ve got the NBC interview right here. She was talking about how she hasn&#8217;t been to the border; she hasn&#8217;t been to Europe either. So, does she think that these two things are the same?<br><br>MS. PSAKI: And, again, Peter, I think she also said in the same interview that she would be open to going to the border at an appropriate time. And what I&#8217;m conveying to you is that, while, as a part of her assignment, she has, of course, hosted a number of bilateral engagements &#8212; she&#8217;s visited the Northern Triangle; she&#8217;s taken &#8212; made a number of announcements about how to address root causes &#8212; that she&#8217;s going &#8212; was going to assess, with the Department of Homeland Security and with the administration, when it was the appropriate time to go.<br><br>And I will note that we&#8217;re at this point in part because we&#8217;ve made a great deal of progress. And if you look just to a couple of months ago, when 6,000 children were in Border Patrol facilities, we&#8217;re now at the point where there&#8217;s far less than 1,000.<br><br>If you look to just a couple of months ago, when there were children who were waiting in Border Patrol facilities for more than 100 hours &#8212; and they were certainly overcrowded &#8212; now it&#8217;s less than 30 hours.<br><br>In April, there were 22,000 kids in HHS facilities, and now that number is 14,000.<br><br>Is there still more work to do? &nbsp;Absolutely. That&#8217;s the purview of Secretary Mayorkas. But it&#8217;s important every component of our government is coordinated.<br><br>Q&nbsp; Was it important for the White House to have her seen at the border before former President Trump has a trip there next week?<br><br>MS. PSAKI: We made an assessment within our government about when it was an appropriate time for her to go to the border.<br><br>Q&nbsp; And then just one about the crime today. You mentioned expanding &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI: The crime prevention roll out.<br><br>Q&nbsp; &#8212; crime prevention, yes. (Laughter.) Not the crime. But there is a lot of crime in big cities. How do you reduce &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI: Much of it caused by gun violence, would you agree?<br><br>Q&nbsp; Yes. So, how do you reduce gun violence by expanding employment opportunities, including summer jobs for young people?<br><br>MS. PSAKI: Well, first, there&#8217;s several components of this proposal. One of them is an initial set of actions on gun violence &#8212; or an additional set, I should say, of steps on gun violence, which the President feels are important to get guns off the streets, make sure they are not in the hands of people illegally, many of whom are playing a role in violent crime across the country. That&#8217;s part of his objective.<br><br>He also wants to provide &#8212; as we&#8217;ve seen has been effective in communities across the country &#8212; incentives and alternatives for young people in communities where that has shown to be an effective step.<br><br>Q&nbsp; So is the thought there basically that somebody &#8212; some criminal who has been committing crimes with limited interruption or interference from police for the last couple of weeks or months is going to stop this easy life of crime if they have a summer job?<br><br>MS. PSAKI: Well, I think the President believes that we shouldn&#8217;t &#8212; we shouldn&#8217;t allow access to guns to those criminals who are currently illegally buying them from some dealers across the country, and part of his announcement is taking steps to do exactly that.<br><br>But part of his announcement is also ensuring there’s specific guidance to communities across the country to ensure that they have funding to get more community police around the country, something that was supported by the American <s>Jobs</s> [Rescue] Plan, that was support- &#8212; that was voted into law by Democrats just a couple of months ago. Some might say that the other party was for defunding the police; I&#8217;ll let others say that, but that&#8217;s a piece.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp; Would you concede there is a political calculation to having the Vice President visit the border before Donald Trump goes and with a drumbeat from Republicans who have counted the days that she has not visited the border? Isn&#8217;t there a political decision in the timing of this?<br><br>MS. PSAKI: Well, Kelly, I would say that we have no way to predict what President &#8212; former President Trump will say when he ha- &#8212; when he goes to the border. We can only guess. But I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;re &#8212; our view is that the Vice President making a trip to the border with the Secretary of Homeland Security to assess and take a look at progress that&#8217;s been made is going to prevent or change what the former President of the United States says when he goes to the border in a couple of days.<br><br>Oh, go ahead. Did you have another question? Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp; Senators, including Senator Tester, are saying that they believe they&#8217;re at really the, kind of, razor&#8217;s edge &#8212; a moment with deciding to payfors &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI: Yeah.<br><br>Q&nbsp; &#8212; for infrastructure: Can they go forward? Do you feel that there is the possibility of some kind of a development within the next 24 hours? Would you agree with that sense of the timing? And is there anything new that the White House has offered for paying for these infrastructure programs that we have not learned of from you before?<br><br>MS. PSAKI: Well, there&#8217;s no question &#8212; as you know, it&#8217;s much easier to negotiate with Congress when they&#8217;re in session. So we&#8217;re certainly hoping to make progress over the next couple of days. I&#8217;m not going to put a 24 or 48 &#8212; there&#8217;s a couple more days in the week, and we&#8217;re hopeful to make progress.<br><br>If we see progress continue to be made between our discussions with our members of our senior team and members, then we look forward to welcoming Democrats and Republicans here to the White House to meet with the President.<br><br>In terms of what we would offer: The President has offered a range of ways to pay for these proposals. And we&#8217;ve also taken &#8212; we had so many options of how to pay for these proposals we&#8217;ve even taken some of our own proposals off the table, including ensuring that individual &#8212; individuals pay a higher rate for this specific negotiation&nbsp;and also raising the corporate rate for this specific negotiation, even though we&#8217;re keeping it on the table for later on &#8212; to be very clear.&nbsp;<br><br>But the bottom line &#8212; it&#8217;s pretty clear and simple to the President. The choice for him on the payfors is: Are you going to ask Americans who are just trying to go to work &#8212; just trying to drive their cars to work, drop their kids off at school &#8212; to pay more through the &#8212; through a gas tax? Or should &#8212; should the wealthiest Americans pay what they owe in taxes? To him, that&#8217;s a pretty clear, no-brainer choice. That&#8217;s part of the discussion though.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp; Thanks. Back to the President&#8217;s crime prevention announcement today: You&#8217;ve noted that violent crime has been up over the last 18 months and several years. So what specifically prompted the President to come out and make this announcement today?<br><br>MS. PSAKI: Well, there&#8217;s a policy process that has been underway for the last couple of weeks and months even. We&#8217;ve had a series of announcements, as you know, over the past several months, on gun violence prevention. Obviously, there was funding in the American Rescue Plan to support keeping cops on the street. And there were several components that were just prepared to be announced.<br><br>Q&nbsp; And you&#8217;ve made clear you&#8217;re tackling this, you know, as a gun issue. The President has urged Congress to take action on this. We have seen very little movement on the Hill. It&#8217;s been years since we&#8217;ve seen sweeping gun reforms out of Washington.<br><br>What is the President&#8217;s message then to Americans who are concerned about rising crime in their communities? In order to achieve real progress, do they have to wait for Congress to act?<br><br>MS. PSAKI: Well, the President would certainly like to see Congress act on universal background checks, on an assault weapons ban, a number of the pieces of legislation that are currently &#8212; I shouldn&#8217;t say &#8220;working their way through Congress,&#8221; but are currently alive in Congress.<br><br>But he&#8217;s not going to wait. And his message to the American people is: He&#8217;s going to take steps that he has the power to take as President to reduce gun violence, to put in place measures that will reduce the likelihood of criminals having access to guns on the streets. There are authorities you have &#8212; any President has. And he&#8217;s going to take steps to do that, even as he pushes for legislation to move forward.<br><br>Q&nbsp; So, beyond the announcements today, he is preparing or considering additional steps that could tackle some of these issues?<br><br>MS. PSAKI: Well, I think we&#8217;re going to focus on the announcements he&#8217;s making today, a lot of which are on gun violence and gun violence prevention measures. I don&#8217;t have anything beyond that to preview, but there are some significant steps he&#8217;s certainly announcing this afternoon.<br><br>Q&nbsp; And just one more question on how the funding for all of this works. You know, you&#8217;re allowing state and local governments to reallocate some of the COVID-19 relief funds to hire more police officers, invest in other areas to combat this rise in crime. But when Republicans pitched that idea to try and pay for some &#8212; an infrastructure plan, the White House said that money was already allocated. So what&#8217;s &#8212; what&#8217;s the difference here?<br><br>MS. PSAKI: Well, the money was always allocated in state and local authority &#8212; to state and local governments. One of the authorities they could always have taken was to ensure there were more cops on the beat, more police in place, and that&#8217;s something we have always said was a part of the plan and the proposal. I don&#8217;t know why Republicans oppose that or why that would have prompted them to vote against the package.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp; Just to follow up on Mary&#8217;s first question, public safety can be a potent political issue. To what degree, if any, has the politics played a role in the decision to really try and get out in front of things today?<br><br>MS. PSAKI: Well, the President has been very consistent in his views over the course of decades. He has never been for defunding the police. He has always been a supporter of ensuring there are &#8212; that local community policing is funded and adequately supported by the federal government. He&#8217;s also been a longtime advocate, for decades, and leader on addressing gun violence. So this is actually a continuity of his leadership on these issues over the course of decades.<br><br>Now, he has taken steps since President on each of these issues as well, including supporting funding &#8212; proposing funding in his own budget for community policing &#8212; and this is just an opportunity to put additional meat on the bones.<br><br>Q&nbsp; And then, two more quick ones. You&#8217;ve answered this before, but just to make sure I understand red lines in the elusive search for payfors that are amenable to everybody: User fees on electric vehicles, is that in the same category as indexing the gas tax from your guys&#8217; perspective in these negotiations?<br><br>MS. PSAKI: Yes, we are not for a Ford F-150 tax. I&#8217;m not sure why others are.<br><br>Q&nbsp; Good framing. And then, quickly, given the tempo of some of the Taliban offensives that we&#8217;ve seen in Afghanistan, are there contingency plans at work right now to either move troops out faster or, perhaps more importantly, embassy officials &#8212; folks that we plan &#8212; the U.S. plans to keep on the ground if they advance much quicker than perhaps was initially thought?<br><br>MS. PSAKI: Well, first, I would say that our Department of Defense is overseeing an orderly withdrawal of our troops from Afghanistan and doing that at a pace that, in their view, will keep &#8212; ensure their safety and ensure we are doing it in a way that&#8217;s effective and in a coordinated manner with the government.<br><br>I will say that while, in general, we are seeing elevated attacks on ANDSF and Afghan government versus a year ago, we have not seen an increase in attacks on our military presence since February 2020. And we also assess that, had we not begun to draw down, violence would have increased against us as well after May 1st, because that was what the Taliban was clearly conveying. So the status quo, in our view, was not an option.<br><br>In terms of personnel and others on the ground, that&#8217;s certainly something that our State Department and our team takes very seriously and assesses whether there is a need to take any additional action. And I would certainly refer &#8212; defer to them on any additional preview they&#8217;d do on that front.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp; Thank you, Jen. We understand that the administration plans to replace the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac&#8217;s federal regulator after the Supreme Court ruling that has now made it easier for the President to install his preferred overseer. Do you have a comment on that?<br><br>MS. PSAKI: That&#8217;s correct, given the Supreme Court ruling this morning. But I don&#8217;t have any timeline for you on when that nomination will be made.<br><br>Q&nbsp; Is there &#8212; is there &#8212; are there any preferred candidates?<br><br>MS. PSAKI: I don&#8217;t have any candidates to preview. When we&#8217;re ready to announce one, we will announce one.<br><br>Q&nbsp; Okay. And any comment on the &#8212; on Russia firing warning shots and dropping bombs to chase a British warship out of waters Moscow now claims that &#8212; in the Black Sea that they claim belongs to Russia?<br><br>MS. PSAKI: I would point you to the British. We don&#8217;t have any more comment on it from here.<br><br>Q&nbsp; And one question on voting rights. We&#8217;ve been kind of talking to a lot of voting rights and civil rights activists who are saying that the President isn&#8217;t just simply doing enough on the issue and is betraying Black voters who actually helped him &#8212; get him &#8212; get into the office by not doing absolutely everything he can. And he&#8217;s instead spending his time negotiating infrastructure with Republicans. How would you respond to that criticism?<br><br>MS. PSAKI: Who was saying that?<br><br>Q&nbsp; A lot of civil rights activists and voting activists.<br><br>MS. PSAKI: Like who?<br><br>Q&nbsp; We&#8217;ve spoken to several groups and outfits. I mean, I can reach out to you with names after the briefing. And &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI: Sure. That sounds good.<br><br>Okay. Go ahead. (Laughter.)<br><br>Q&nbsp; Thanks, Jen. A number of lawmakers have asked the administration to extend the federal moratorium on evictions which expires at the end of the month. Is that something the administration is considering? And why or why not?<br><br>MS. PSAKI: Sure. Well, let me first say that that would be a decision &#8212; the decision to extend the eviction moratorium will be made by the CDC, based on public health conditions. And we certainly wouldn&#8217;t get ahead of their assessment.<br><br>As you know, the moratorium &#8212; the eviction moratorium expires on June 30th &#8212; 30th. Hence, I think, your question. It was always intended to be temporary. And the President remains focused on ensuring that Americans who are struggling, through no fault of their own, have an off-ramp once it ends. Hence, we&#8217;ve also worked to take additional steps to ensure people are getting the support they need to stay in their homes, whether they are renters or homeowners.<br><br>But we&#8217;d certainly defer to the CDC on their decision and their timeline.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp; Thanks, Jen. The Miami Police Chief, Art Acevedo, expressed concern, disappointment that his association wasn&#8217;t invited to the discussion. He &#8212; his association represents dozens of the largest city police forces: the Major Cities Chiefs Association. I just wanted to ask why the group wasn&#8217;t invited, considering the role that they would likely be part of it.<br><br>MS. PSAKI: Well, I think, as we were putting together the roundtable that the President is taking part in today, we tried to have a diverse group of individuals representing a range of interests from across the country who have all played an active and vital role in addressing crime and crime prevention across the country.<br><br>It is not meant to diminish anyone, including the individual you mentioned. And I&#8217;m sure we will be closely engaged with them and others who are not a part of this roundtable.<br><br>Q&nbsp; One more question on &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI: Sure.<br><br>Q&nbsp; &#8212; the crime and gun prevention effort. This effort involves redirecting some of the relief aid (inaudible). It gives wide latitude for spending that money in certain areas. But the Biden administration largely opposed redirecting relief funds for infrastructure projects. There were some limited exceptions: water and sewer. But why was it not okay for infrastructure or limited for infrastructure, but it is more okay for this area? This &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI: I think this is similar to the question Mary just asked. I mean, it has always been the case that ensuring funding was used by state and local authorities to keep cops on the beat was always a part of what was allowed in the parameters of the spending. And that is something that a number of communities, as I outlined at the beginning, did take the steps to do. So this is just giving additional guidance on how to use the funds.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp; Thanks, Jen. On the meeting later today between Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi and White House officials: What is the White House&#8217;s message to them going to be with regard to the infrastructure talks? Are you going to insist on continuing going down the bipartisan route? Or is this going to be a decision point where they may sort of kick the tires and go ahead with reconciliation on that?<br><br>MS. PSAKI: Well, we&#8217;ve always seen this &#8212; or seen this for some time, I should say &#8212; not always &#8212; as a two-track strategy. Right? So there are different discussions and negotiations happening today.<br><br>One track &#8212; the American Jobs Plan, or big components of it &#8212; is a part of the infrastructure negotiations that we&#8217;re discussing &#8212; Steve Ricchetti, Louisa Terrell, Brian Deese &#8212; right now with members who are part of that bipartisan discussion.<br><br>Later tonight is a discussion that will also include Shalanda Young, also includes Susan Rice and others. That&#8217;s a part &#8212; a discussion, in part, about the budget reconciliation process &#8212; the second track. And that track will include the American Families Plan and components that are not a part of the negotiation.<br><br>So we&#8217;ve been saying two tracks. Today is an example of two tracks actually moving forward at one time in one day.<br><br>Q&nbsp; Which track is moving more smoothly right now? (Laughter.)<br><br>MS. PSAKI: They&#8217;re both moving at a rapid pace. You know, they&#8217;re both moving. We &#8212; we know that, one, we&#8217;re at a later stage, obviously, in the bipartisan negotiations. You all know that. And obviously, we want to make progress over the next couple of days.<br><br>We&#8217;re in an earlier stage of the budget reconciliation progress &#8212; process. That&#8217;s because that&#8217;s how that process works. But it&#8217;s important to keep both tracks going.<br><br>Q&nbsp; And then just one more for you on &#8212; I just wanted to follow up if you had any answer from yesterday what &#8212; about whether President Biden discussed interest rates with the Fed Chairman Powell and other financial regulators.<br><br>MS. PSAKI: I just &#8212; the interest rates, as you know, are the &#8212; under the purview of the Federal Reserve. I gave you an asses- &#8212; an overview of what was discussed in the meeting and don&#8217;t have anything else to add to that.<br><br>Q&nbsp; Afghanistan?<br><br>Q&nbsp; On the For the &#8212; thanks, Jen.<br><br>MS. PSAKI: Yeah.<br><br>Q&nbsp; On the For the People Act that &#8212; you said this week that it would be the fight of this presidency. The President said last night the fight is not over. Now that the Senate has put itself in the record, how do you see this fight playing out in the 117th Congress on the floor? Is it going to be won on the floor before the end of this Congress?<br><br>MS. PSAKI: We&#8217;ll see. I don&#8217;t think we can assess that quite yet. And I think what&#8217;s important to know is that the President is going to keep fighting for federal legislation. The Vice President is going to keep fighting for federal legislation. Leader Schumer and others have also made clear, I think, on the floor last night: They&#8217;re going to continue to look for paths forward.<br><br>We will &#8212; we will see what that looks like, but we&#8217;re &#8212; we&#8217;re still assessing that in the coming days.<br><br>What the President will also talk about though, next week, is &#8212; not that fight &#8212; but also what we can do in states around the country, what we can do through a range of the authorities that the federal government has. Because for all of these, our objective is to make it easier to vote, make it more accessible to vote. And there&#8217;s a lot of ways to do that, even as we&#8217;re continuing to fight for federal legislation.<br><br>Q&nbsp; I want to ask you another question about the border. You said that a lot of &#8212; a great deal of progress has been made.<br><br>MS. PSAKI: Mm-hmm.<br><br>Q&nbsp; Border Patrol statistics show something close to 900,000 interactions or encounters on the southwest border so far this fiscal year, 170,000-odd per month the last three months. Is that where you&#8217;re measuring progress? You spoke of the unaccompanied minors, but what about the influx of people? The Vice President was tasked with the diplomatic efforts there. Has that been successful? And how are you measuring that success?<br><br>MS. PSAKI: Well, first, I think the Vice President has made a number of announcements about coordinated efforts with countries in the region, in the Northern Triangle, through her leadership in that area. And we&#8217;ll &#8212; we&#8217;ll be able to assess over time what it looks like in terms of migration numbers.<br><br>I was pointing to the fact that, a couple of months ago, we were looking at very overcrowded Border Patrol facilities, we were looking at kids waiting for far too long in those facilities, and there being a timeline of getting kids to vetted family members that wasn&#8217;t up to our &#8212; up to our bar. There has certainly been progress made in that regard, but the work is ongoing.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp; Thanks, Jen. My colleagues are reporting that the U.S. intelligence community concluded last week that the government of Afghanistan could collapse as soon as six months after the American withdrawal is completed. What is your reaction to that? And do you think that would also factor into speeding up an evacuation, especially for Afghans who helped the U.S.?<br><br>MS. PSAKI: Well, let me first say, on SIVs &#8212; on Special Immigrant Visas &#8212; and these are individuals who have played an incredibly courageous role in helping the United States at various times over the course of our recent history: We are processing and getting people out at a record pace. We are working with Congress right now to streamline some of the requirements that slow this process down, and we&#8217;re doing the kind of extensive planning for potential evacuation should that become necessary.<br><br>So we are continuing to evaluate what our options are there, continuing to take steps forward. And certainly, we want to take every step we can take from the federal government to treat all of these courageous individuals as they deserve.<br><br>Q&nbsp; Is there a reaction on that intelligence community&#8217;s assessment at all &#8212; that the government could collapse within six months of the U.S. withdrawing?<br><br>MS. PSAKI: I don&#8217;t have any more assessment beyond the intelligence community.<br><br>Q&nbsp; Follow-up on the Afghanistan, please?<br><br>MS. PSAKI: Mm-hmm. Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp; Yes. As you know, President Ghani will be here on Friday.<br><br>MS. PSAKI: Mm-hmm.<br><br>Q&nbsp; While President Ghani and Dr. Abdullah Abdullah are visiting Washington, D.C., Taliban has still continued their attack all over Afghanistan. Do you think that President Biden is committed to a stronger, long-term support for Afghan people, especially Afghan military? Because Afghan people have high expectations from this trip &#8212; the President of Afghanistan.<br><br>MS. PSAKI: I wouldn&#8217;t say I don&#8217;t anticipate &#8212; the timeline for withdrawal is not going to change by September, which, of course, is overseen by our Department of Defense. A part of their discussion on Friday will certainly be the President reiterating his commitment to work with the government of Afghanistan to continue to provide humanitarian support, over-the-horizon security &#8212; you know, work that &#8212; that he committed to when he made this announcement. And I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;ll discuss this during their meeting on Friday.<br><br>Go ahead. Francesca, go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp; I&#8217;ve got a couple. I&#8217;ve got a couple for you.<br><br>MS. PSAKI: Sure.<br><br>Q&nbsp; Firstly, on the &#8212; on the Vice President&#8217;s trip to&nbsp;the border, why does the White House view this as the appropriate time for that visit?<br><br>MS. PSAKI: Well, I think, Francesca, the decision on the timing was made in coordination with the Department of Homeland Security. As we&#8217;ve said from the beginning, we didn&#8217;t want to have anyone visit at a time where it&#8217;d be disruptive to efforts and progress being made on the ground, but they made that assessment. And she had said, just a few weeks ago, that she&#8217;d be open to going to the border if &#8212; at the appropriate time.<br><br>Q&nbsp; And earlier today the White House announced that 15 jurisdictions would participate in its community violence intervention program.<br><br>MS. PSAKI: Mm-hmm.<br><br>Q&nbsp; Do you anticipate that list expanding to include other cities &#8212; like Kansas City, which has grappled with gun violence and has been engaged with the White House on this issue?<br><br>MS. PSAKI: That&#8217;s a great question. And you&#8217;re right that it was 15 cities that we announced &#8212; or 15 jurisdictions that we announced this morning. Those jurisdictions stepped &#8212; or we will announce &#8212; I guess, I should say, &#8220;later this afternoon&#8221; &#8212; they stepped forward to join the collaborative because they&#8217;re committed to using these strategies as a tool to reducing the scourge of gun violence.<br><br>They have also designated a portion of their American Rescue Plan state and local funding &#8212; or another source of public funding &#8212; to support CVI efforts and have committed to city leadership and infrastructure, such as leading local efforts through an Office of Neighborhood Safety. We&#8217;re calling for more cities to follow these jurisdictions&#8217; lead, and, certainly, we&#8217;d welcome engagement and a desire to follow those trends as well.<br><br>Q&nbsp; And lastly, is the White House worried that its non-infrastructure agenda is being stymied to the point that it could have a negative impact on Democrats competing in next year&#8217;s elections?<br><br>MS. PSAKI: You mean our budget reconciliation process we&#8217;re meeting about today?<br><br>Q&nbsp; No, I&#8217;m talking about the $15 minimum wage, voting rights. There&#8217;s ongoing disputes over childcare, other elements of the Families Plan, immigration reform. There&#8217;s &#8212; there&#8217;s a number of different things.<br><br>MS. PSAKI: I will say that the American Families Plan is a part of the budget reconciliation discussion and process. That&#8217;s an historic investment in childcare, and community college, and universal pre-K &#8212; a number of areas that are a huge, huge priority to the President, as well as many Democrats.<br><br>I think, ultimately, I&#8217;m not going to assess, 18 months from the midterm elections, what that looks like. But the most important topics on the Ameri- &#8212; minds of the American people are COVID and the economy, and we&#8217;re certainly moving forward on all fronts.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp; Thank you, Jen. First, a question on Afghanistan. The Afghani leaders who are coming to meet with the President on Friday are going to want specifics about U.S. support to secure the governance and human rights gains that have been fraught for the last 20 years there. Can the President guarantee that those gains won&#8217;t be lost?<br><br>MS. PSAKI: The President can guarantee that we will continue to support humanitarian assistance; support for progress &#8212; human rights progress that&#8217;s been made on the ground; and a range of investments the United States have made that we&#8217;ve already committed to continuing.<br><br>Q&nbsp; Has he determined how much money that is needed?<br><br>MS. PSAKI: Over the course of time? That&#8217;s going to be done on kind of a year-by-year assessment.<br><br>Q&nbsp; In the next year then, is there any sort of estimate there?<br><br>MS. PSAKI: Beyond our budget? I don&#8217;t have anything more beyond our budget.<br><br>Q&nbsp; On crime, I just wanted to ask quickly if you could give us any details about who helped shape the President&#8217;s crime plan. You know, was there was input from various activists, perhaps from the Floyd family?<br><br>MS. PSAKI: It was certainly driven, of course, by the President of the United States, who oversees all of our policies here, and driven by policy leaders within the government &#8212; from Susan Rice, Cedric Richmond, a number &#8212; there&#8217;s obviously economic components &#8212; Gene Sperling, Brian Deese. And they certainly do assess and engage with a range of activists and leaders around the country, but I don&#8217;t have any more detail to read out for you.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp; Jen, just one more.<br><br>MS. PSAKI: Oh, yeah. Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp; Just really quickly: On the Vice President, there&#8217;s a lot of discussion today about the Vice President&#8217;s role in immigration, but I was wondering if you could outline any of her involvement, in the last few moments, on infrastructure &#8212; a different topic that is, sort of, in the closing stage right now. Has her portfolio there, sort of, gotten lower as other things have risen, or can you just give us the, sort of, state of play?<br><br>MS. PSAKI: Sure. Well, I would say that the negotiations are primarily being led at a staff level by Louisa Terrell, Steve Ricchetti, and Brian Deese. And again, if we&#8217;re at the point where we&#8217;ve made enough progress, the President will invite them here, and I&#8217;m sure the Vice President would be a part of that. But they&#8217;ve really been led at the staff level over the past couple of days. And if there&#8217;s calls that warrant the Vice President or the President making, certainly they would make them. But that&#8217;s really what the action &#8212; where the action has been over the last several days.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp; Thanks. Just to follow on my colleague&#8217;s question about the eviction moratorium &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI: Sure.<br><br>Q&nbsp; &#8212; there&#8217;s some reporting that there&#8217;s a one-month extension that&#8217;s going to come out pretty soon. I know you said you don&#8217;t want to ahead of the CDC, but the CDC is punting all of our questions back to you. So is there anything you &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI: That&#8217;s confusing. Sorry.<br><br>Q&nbsp; It is. (Laughter.) Is there anything you can tell us about whether a one-month extension is to be expected?<br><br>MS. PSAKI: I don&#8217;t have anything I can confirm for you from here today.<br><br>Q&nbsp; Okay. And then, on guns: All advocates are saying there should be gun czar. Is that something that&#8217;s still being considered by the White House: one person that&#8217;s responsible and spearheading this work on gun reform?<br><br>MS. PSAKI: The President is responsible.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp; Yes. Thank you, Jen. For some months, lawmakers of both parties have been asking the administration to prohibit polysilicon from coming into the country from China because it&#8217;s being made in Xinjiang. It&#8217;s a key material, as you may know, for solar panels.<br><br>So, is there some concern that prohibiting that from China could hurt the President&#8217;s net zero goals? Or what are you looking at doing, in regards to this, from the human rights perspective?<br><br>MS. PSAKI: Well, first, let me say that, in Cornwall, just two weeks ago, G7 countries committed to ensuring that global supply chains are free from the use of forced labor. And they&#8217;re &#8212; which was a significant statement and agreement among G7 countries.<br><br>And so, as a part of that, you can expect that the United States will continue to hold those who engage in forced labor accountable and that we will continue to remove goods made from local forced labor from our supply chains.<br><br>As you also know, and I think this is the root of your question, we also remain committed to making progress internationally &#8212; glo- &#8212; domestically and internationally on addressing the climate crisis. But we think we can certainly do both.<br><br>I don&#8217;t have anything yet to announce as it relates to specific products &#8212; or substances, I should say &#8212; that are planned, but we&#8217;ll see if we have more on that in the coming days.<br><br>Q&nbsp; We have to gather for the event.<br><br>MS. PSAKI: Oh, okay. Great. We have to gather for the event.<br><br>Thanks, everyone, so much. Have a great day. See you tomorrow.<br><br>2:01 P.M. EDT</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Washington National Cathedral<br>Washington, D.C.</p>



<p>11:21 A.M. EDT<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:  Reverend Hollerith, distinguished clergy, members of the Congress and our military, distinguished guests, Jeanne, Virginia, John, Mary, and Andrew, and the Warner family: It&#8217;s a great honor to be invited to speak a few moments about John.<br><br>A few days after John’s passing, I visited Arlington National Cemetery on Memorial Day &#8212; a sacred place on solemn day when we undertake the fundamental act of remembrance.  And amid the moments that I was there and the monuments of stone, we remembered each marker represented a precious life.  We remembered the heroes of the greatest generation the world has ever known and that bears a noble name: the United States of America.<br><br>The only nation founded on an idea that we&#8217;re all created equal, &#8220;endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable Rights,&#8221; including, &#8220;Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.&#8221;  And a democracy that is the very soul of our nation and that must be defended at all costs &#8212; a soul embodied by all those patriots buried in Arlington and the fields across the world, and by our dear friend, John Warner.<br><br>Like many here, I had the privilege of serving with John for three decades in the United States Senate.  While we represented different political parties, I can say without hesitation John was a man of conscience, character, and honor, with a deep commitment to God and country. <br><br>Enlisted in the Navy &#8212; the United States Navy at age 17 to fight in World War Two.  A few years later, enlisted in the Marine Corps to fight in Korea.<br><br>Eventually named Secretary of the Navy by President Nixon.  Then elected to the United States Senate, where he became a towering and respected voice on foreign policy, national security, and defense.  The second-longest-serving senator from Virginia and the longest-serving Republican. <br><br>A member of the Greatest Generation.  And as that, he understood that democracy is more than a form of government; democracy is a way of being.  He understood it begins and grows in an open heart, and with the willingness to work across the aisle and come together in common cause.<br><br>And that empathy &#8212; empathy &#8212; is the fuel of democracy, the willingness to see each other as opponents, not as enemies.  Above all, to see each other as fellow Americans even when we disagree.  From John&#8217;s perspective, especially when we disagree.<br><br>That’s how John forged consensus and made sure our system worked and delivered for the people.<br><br>I saw it time and again on issues of war and peace.  John opposing torture and ending gun violence.  On protecting the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary.<br><br>John’s decisions were always guided by his values, by his convictions, and never by personal political consequences.  And was always guided by his obligations to all of those he represented, even those who did not vote for him.<br><br>Every senator wears the pride of his or her state on their sleeve, but John’s love for the people of Virginia was something special.  And they loved him back and kept reelecting him because they knew John understood the job of senator was bigger than himself.  It was about more than just John. <br><br>And as we say in the Senate, “Excuse me a point of personal privilege”: When John endorsed me for President last year, it carried an extra meaning for me.  The senators and congresspersons here will understand this.  It wasn’t merely that a prominent Republican endorsed me; when John endorsed me, it gave me confidence.  Not about winning &#8212; about being able to do the job.  John gave me confidence.<br><br>You know, in the battle for the soul of America today, John Warner is a reminder of what we can do when we come together as one nation.<br><br>While we’ve never made real the full promise of America to all Americans, John’s life is a reminder that every generation &#8212; every generation has opened the door of opportunity a little bit wider.  Every one.<br><br>And the mission handed down generation to generation is the work of perfecting the union &#8212; a mission he now leaves us with a way forward. <br><br>That’s the power of remembrance.  It lies not just in our history, but in our hope for the future.  Not just in our solace, but in our strength.<br><br>It lies in our hearts to continue the work of democracy &#8212; the work of our time, of all time, and the work of John’s whole life. <br><br>To John’s Senate staff: Thank you for your service and for all you’ll do to carry on John’s legacy.<br><br>And to his family &#8212; Jeanne, Virginia, John, Mary, Andrew &#8212; Jill [and] I know it hurts to remember.  Sometimes it just hurts to remember.  But it’s also the way to heal &#8212; to remember.<br><br>The Bible teaches, “Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted.”  While comfort can be a long time in coming, I promise you it will come.  It will give you purpose in his memory, in his love for you, and his love for this country.<br><br>Virginia, I know you’ll be reciting your father’s favorite poem &#8212; a sort of an anthem.<br><br>Here’s another one that describes him so well, in my view, that means a great deal to my family and to me.  It’s called “American Anthem”:<br><br><em>&#8220;The work and prayers of centuries have brought us to this day,</em><br><em>What shall be our legacy?  What will our children say?</em><br><em>Let me know in my heart when my days are through,</em><br><em>America, America, I gave my best to you&#8221;</em><br><br>John Warner gave his best to America and, to the best of my knowledge, to everybody he had a relationship with. <br><br>May God bless him.  He was a good man, a great American.  It was an honor to have known him and worked with him.<br><br>11:30 A.M. EDT</p>

Thank you so much, [senior administration official].&nbsp; And thanks, everyone, for giving us a little of your time this evening.<br><br>You will have heard President Biden, again and again, call the nation&#8217;s attention to what he has said is a public health epidemic: gun violence.&nbsp; He has talked about the gun violence that makes national headlines, but also the gun violence that doesn&#8217;t make national headlines and tears apart families every day in this country.&nbsp; He&#8217;s talked about not just mass shootings, but also community violence, suicide by firearms, domestic violence by firearms.<br><br>We know that the secondary consequences of the pandemic and the proliferation of illegal guns have led to increased violence in the past year and a half, including a 30 percent increase in homicides and 8 percent increase in gun assaults in large cities in 2020.<br><br>In the first quarter of 2021, homicides are 24 percent higher than the first quarter of <s>2022</s> [2020].&nbsp; Since day one of his administration, President Biden has taken action to address this increase in gun violence and other violent crime, giving cities and states the resources they need to make their communities safer.<br><br>In April, you saw the President announce a package of executive actions to reduce gun violence while he continued to call for Congress to act.&nbsp; He announced that the Justice Department was going to stem the flow of ghost guns into our communities, that they were going to better regulate firearms with arm braces, that the federal government was going to make changes to 26 federal programs to invest more funding in community violence intervention.&nbsp; And the President nominated David Chipman to be the leader that we need at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.<br><br>You saw the President, in his American Jobs Plan, call on Congress to invest $5 billion in community violence interventions, which are programs we know work to reduce community violence in our cities.&nbsp; And you saw him put forward a fiscal year 2022 budget request that had increases &#8212; increased funding for ATF to do its job.<br><br>Building on all of these actions, tomorrow the President is announcing his comprehensive strategy to prevent and respond to gun crime and ensure public safety.&nbsp; He will be meeting with state and local leaders, a collection of mayors, of police chiefs,&nbsp; eight state attorney generals, and community violence intervention experts to continue the conversation he has been having with local leaders across the country regarding what they are seeing on the ground, how federal &#8212; and how the federal government can help them make their community safer.&nbsp; And the President will deliver remarks to announce his comprehensive strategy to prevent and respond to gun crime and ensure public safety.&nbsp;<br><br>This plan has five parts.&nbsp; I will talk about &#8212; I will provide a brief overview of a few of them, and then turn it over to my colleague to cover the rest.<br><br>The first section of this comprehensive strategy will stem the flow of firearms used to commit violence.&nbsp; You &#8212; as I mentioned, you&#8217;ve already heard the President talk about the administration&#8217;s efforts to stem the flow of ghost guns into our communities.&nbsp;<br><br>Tomorrow, the Biden administration will announce additional action.&nbsp; The Justice Department is announcing a new policy to underscore zero tolerance for willful violations of the law by federally licensed firearms dealers that put public safety at risk.&nbsp; Absent extraordinary circumstances that would need to be justified to the director, ATF will seek to revoke the licenses of dealers that first time that they violate federal law by willfully taking &#8212; undertaking a number of actions, including transferring a firearm to a prohibited person and failing to respond to an ATF tracing request.&nbsp; This will be a historic policy that will make sure that we hold gun dealers across the country who are contributing to the supply of crime guns accountable.<br><br>The President will also be announcing policies to maximize the efficacy of ATF resources to crack down on rogue gun dealers violating our laws.&nbsp; As I said, the President&#8217;s fiscal year 2022 budget request would allow ATF to add inspectors in every field division around the country.<br><br>In the meantime, the administration is going to be taking action to make sure that we&#8217;re using ATF resources to the best of our capacity.&nbsp; This includes designating, for mayors, a specific point of contact in every field division, so mayors, police chiefs, or other local leaders can report concerns about particular dealer compliance with the law.&nbsp; It also means giving the 16 states that have their own gun dealer licensing system their &#8212; the federal inspection data so those states can then determine whether to take their own steps to shut down dealers that fail to live up to their obligations under state law.<br><br>Additionally, you saw, today, the Justice Department announced that it is launching five multi-jurisdictional firearms trafficking strike forces.&nbsp; These strike forces are focused on addressing significant firearm trafficking corridors that have diverted guns to some of our major cities.&nbsp; They recognize that we need multi-jurisdictional coordination to reduce the flow of firearms into cities and that cities can pass laws within their own jurisdictions, but need support to stem the flow of &#8212; from other cities and states.<br><br>The second category of action is providing law enforcement the tools and resources needed to tackle gun violence.&nbsp; As part of the Justice Department&#8217;s comprehensive strategy for reducing violent crime, the Justice Department is committed to supporting law enforcement in local communities and addressing gun violence.<br><br>Last month, we saw the Justice Department announce that it is providing support for local law enforcement from the FBI, ATF, DEA, and the United States Marshal Services.&nbsp;<br><br>Tomorrow, the Treasury Department will be building on this by highlighting that communities experiencing a surge in gun violence as a result of the pandemic may use the American Rescue Plan’s $350 billion in state and local funding for purposes such as hiring law enforcement officials to advance community policing strategies, giving police departments and cities funding for additional enforcement efforts to reduce gun violence exacerbated by the pandemic, including prosecuting gun traffickers, and investing in technology and equipment to allow law enforcement to more efficiently and effectively respond to the rise in gun violence resulting from the pandemic.<br><br>I want to pause here for a moment because this is a historic amount of funding that the President is making available to cities and states through the American Rescue Plan to invest in a range of tools to reduce gun violence in their communities and make their communities safer.<br><br>To talk about the next section of the strategy, I will turn it over to my colleague, [senior administration official].<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Thanks, [senior administration official].&nbsp; Hey, everybody.&nbsp; Good to be with you.<br><br>The next part of the strategy here &#8212; the third element &#8211;is about investing in community violence intervention programs.&nbsp; You have heard us talk about this before, these &#8212; and the President specifically talked about this before repeatedly.&nbsp; Community violence intervention programs are a huge part of the President&#8217;s gun violence reduction strategy as well.<br><br>These are programs that target individuals who are most likely to be involved in gun violence, either as perpetrators or as victims &#8212; to deescalate tensions, to prevent retaliation, and to save lives.&nbsp; They have a significant wraparound services component &#8212; helping people with job placement, with healthcare, cognitive behavioral therapy, education, and a number of other services to help folks get their lives on a different track and to prevent violence.<br><br>The White House is going to be launching &#8212; is launching a CVI collaborative of 15 different jurisdictions that are investing their ARP money or other public funds into CVI programs to save lives this summer and beyond.&nbsp; The White House is going to support them.&nbsp; They will also receive support from a group of funders who are coming together to invest millions of dollars over the next 18 months to support these efforts.<br><br>In addition, the Treasury Department guidance that [senior administration official] referenced reiterates that the $350 billion in state and local funding can be used for CVI programs &#8212; that is that CVI programs are eligible uses of that money.<br><br>The Department of Education has put out guidance as well.&nbsp; That guidance went out on Thursday of last week.&nbsp; It reiterates that the $122 billion in K-through-12 funding in ARP can be used for these purposes as well, where there&#8217;s education or student-focused components to the programs.<br><br>We put out guidance &#8212; these agencies put out guidance earlier this year as well.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re emphasizing this to make crystal clear that these funds can be used for these purposes.<br><br>And, of course, this all builds on the President&#8217;s historic commitment to secure $5.2 billion of funding for community violence interventions through the American Jobs Plan and the President&#8217;s discretionary budget request.<br><br>As [senior administration official] mentioned, we have also pivoted 26 programs over five days across five agencies to support this work.<br><br>The next element of the strategy is expanding summer programs and employment opportunities, as well as other services, for young people.&nbsp; As you may know, young people are less likely to commit crime when they&#8217;re productively engaged in the summer, and that is true for gun violence as well.&nbsp; There are evaluations that have been done showing that violence is reduced as much as 35 or 45 percent, depending on the city and the program, based on summer youth employment opportunities and other services.<br><br>The Biden administration &#8212; the Biden-Harris administration is included in the guidance from the Treasury and Education departments that ARP funding can be used to hire additional school counselors, nurses, social workers, and other practitioners who can support youth and young people during the summer, but these funds can also be used for summer job and summer education programs, and they can be used for wraparound services, such as housing assistance, healthcare, substance use disorder, and food assistance.<br><br>Also, I want to mention that, as part of this strategy, the Department of Labor recently awarded $119 million in workforce development grants to serve young people in particular.&nbsp;<br><br>The fifth part of the strategy here is to help formerly incarcerated individuals successfully reenter their communities.&nbsp; Helping formerly incarcerated individuals is a public safety strategy.&nbsp; We know that finding a good job makes a person much less likely to recidivate.<br><br>Yesterday, the Department of Labor awarded $85 million to help people in 28 communities transition from incarceration to employment.&nbsp; Those funds will serve approximately 9,000 people.<br><br>In addition, the Office of Personnel Management &#8212; OPM &#8212; will examine barriers to employment for formerly incarcerated people within the federal government and will consider steps to remove those barriers, including potentially creating new hiring authority for agencies to hire formerly incarcerated people into the excepted service.&nbsp; These are one-year appointments that can be extended for a second year and that help build a person&#8217;s experience and their employment history and make them more competitive for federal jobs in the future.<br><br>OPM is also going to be issuing regulations under the &#8220;ban the box&#8221; legislation, the Fair Chance Act from 2019.&nbsp;<br><br>In addition, the Department of Justice is going to bring back the Second Chance fellowship.&nbsp; That is a program that will, through a competitive grant solicitation, bring a formerly incarcerated person into the Justice Department to serve in a role working on reentry issues and bring their expertise to bear.<br><br>On top of that, the Departments of Labor and Treasury are going to be taking steps to educate employers and help them understand how they can leverage existing tax credits to incentivize the hiring of formerly incarcerated individuals.&nbsp;<br><br>There&#8217;s something called the Work Opportunity Tax Credit.&nbsp; It applies to multiple categories, including people with convictions &#8212; with felony convictions.&nbsp; And employers who hire individuals in this category can receive up to $2,400 in credit against their federal income tax if they are hiring a person within one year of the person&#8217;s conviction or release from prison for a felony offense.<br><br>The Departments of Labor and Treasury are going to take steps to ensure that employers know about this tax credit and how to leverage it in relationship with other tax credits to incentivize the hiring of these individuals.<br><br>Finally, the Department of Housing and Urban Development is going to be putting out a letter from Secretary Fudge, outlining actions that HUD is taking to address the housing needs of formerly incarcerated individuals &#8212; returning citizens &#8212; and specifically how the 70,000 emergency housing vouchers that are funded by the American Rescue Plan can be used to support these individuals.&nbsp; Because if they&#8217;re coming out of prison and they don&#8217;t have a stable housing situation, then they meet the definition of being at risk of homelessness in the ARP.&nbsp; And the &#8212; Secretary Fudge is going to be lifting this up.<br><br>This is an important part of the President&#8217;s strategy because it is not just jobs, it is a whole fleet of services that are necessary to ensure successful reentry, including stable housing.<br><br>So that completes the fifth piece, and I&#8217;m going to turn it back to you, [senior administration official].<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; All right.&nbsp; Thank you, [senior administration official].&nbsp; And thank you, [senior administration official].&nbsp; Just as a reminder: This is on background, attributable to “senior administration officials.”&nbsp;<br><br>We will now open it up for some question and answer.&nbsp; If you have a question, please press the “raise hand” button on Zoom, and then we will get to as many questions as we can.&nbsp; Just give it one minute for anyone who has a question.&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey, thanks, guys.&nbsp; Can you hear me?&nbsp;<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yeah.<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; We can.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay, thanks so much for doing this.&nbsp; So, as I understand it, the strategy gives cities the ability to use $350 billion in ARP funds to hire police officers or invest in community programs.&nbsp; But is the administration giving guidance about what ratio should go to what?&nbsp; Like is &#8212; what’s to stop communities from spending 99 percent on police officers and only a token amount on community programs?<br><br>And a second question on the CVI collaborative: It says that those cities are, you know, dedicating a portion of that to community interventions.&nbsp; Is there a sense of, like, which portion of that?&nbsp; I know it&#8217;s another ratio question.<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Absolutely.&nbsp; I&#8217;m going to turn it over to my colleague to take the second question, and then I&#8217;m happy to take the first one.&nbsp;<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Yeah, thanks.&nbsp; No, there&#8217;s not a specific percentage that&#8217;s being required as part of the involvement in the collaborative here.&nbsp; But these are going to be significant investments from each of the cities, and I think maybe we could follow up with further information about that.&nbsp; But it&#8217;s not a, kind of, hard and fast &#8212; and that is because it&#8217;s important that there not be a, kind of, “one size fits all” approach to public safety here.&nbsp;<br><br>And the President is &#8212; the President’s strategy on combating gun crime is meant to allow cities and other local jurisdictions to tailor their approaches to public safety and gun violence and gun crime reduction to their own particular circumstances.&nbsp;<br><br>So we didn’t &#8212; we don&#8217;t want to artificially shape that from here.&nbsp; The President is giving individuals resources and giving cities resources and guidance to allow them to address the particular needs that they have.&nbsp;<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Thanks so much.&nbsp; And then, to address your first question, I think the answer is similar to what my colleague just said.&nbsp; What the Treasury gui- &#8212; the Treasury Department is clarifying tomorrow is that American Rescue Plan dollars can be used in cities that have experienced an increase in gun violence as a result of the pandemic to pursue a range of policies that are tailored to reduce gun violence.&nbsp;<br><br>So a city can choose to use funding to advance community policing to be responsive to gun violence in that community.&nbsp; Cities can also choose &#8212; in addition to or instead &#8212; to invest in community violence intervention or to invest in summer program opportun- &#8212; programming opportunities, job training opportunities, all of the tools in the toolkit.<br><br>The President is giving these cities unprecedented resources through the American Rescue Plan to invest in the tools they think make sense in their communities.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey, yes, thanks for doing this.&nbsp; I just want to ask:&nbsp; I mean, in the big picture, can you speak about how it seems like the American Rescue Plan is central to this overall strategy to combat violence in cities.&nbsp; Can you talk about how &#8212; I mean, how important you think it is?&nbsp; And were the funds designed with this in mind in the first place?&nbsp; Or is this kind of retroactively, it just seems like, that this can be helpful to your efforts?<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Yeah, so the American Rescue Plan was designed to help community &#8212; well, the state and local funding in the American Rescue Plan was designed to help state and local governments respond to the impacts of the pandemic &#8212; one of them being an increase in gun violence, which can be attributed to a range of opt- &#8212; a range of reasons resulting from the pandemic, secondary impacts of the pandemic.&nbsp;<br><br>And the funding that the President is providing for the American Rescue Plan is historic in terms of the flexibility and the opportunity it provides to these communities to make changes that can have effects in the weeks and months ahead.&nbsp;<br><br>It is, of course, only part of the comprehensive strategy that the President is putting forward.&nbsp; You know, not everything comes down to funding, but the other big funding piece here is the President continues to call for Congress to invest $5 billion over eight years in community violence interventions.&nbsp;<br><br>We also have a range of non-budget actions that the President &#8212; that the administration is taking, including the new zero tolerance lens that the Justice Department will be using with dealers who willfully violate policies.&nbsp;<br><br>So I would say that the American Rescue Plan funding is a critical resource that the President is giving cities and states right now to help reduce gun violence in their communities.&nbsp; It is one of the tools that the President is giving these cities and states through this comprehensive strategy.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, thanks for doing this call.&nbsp; There are a number of governors and state legislatures that are either contemplating or have taken actions to constrain state law enforcement from enforcing federal gun laws.&nbsp; And really, there is a growing movement to just ignore a lot of federal gun laws in many states which have Republican-controlled legislatures and governors mansions.&nbsp; Is the administration prepared to take any action to counter this or push back against state governments that are going to resist enforcing federal firearms laws?<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Yeah, thanks so much for the question.&nbsp; I know that there are a number of cases of this in ongoing enforcement decisions, which I would refer you to the Justice Department to respond to.&nbsp;<br><br>What I will say is that, in the midst of all these state actions, more broadly, the President continues to push for legislative action at the federal level and continues to push, and we continue to see progress at the same time.&nbsp;<br><br>And many states are leading the way, in terms of enacting policies that will help reduce gun violence in our country, whether that be universal background checks at the state level, banning untraceable ghost guns at the state level, passing extreme risk protection order laws at the state level, or more.&nbsp;<br><br>So the President, over the past few months, has been focusing on calling on federal &#8212; calling on Congress to act and encouraging constructive state action.&nbsp;<br><br>And I would refer you to the Justice Department regarding the enforcement question you asked.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi.&nbsp; Thank you for doing this.&nbsp; And thank you for taking my question.&nbsp; I have a question about some conservative groups &#8212; in particular, the Heritage Foundation has pointed to some of the policies that prosecutors in cities like Baltimore &#8212; whose mayor will be at tomorrow&#8217;s meeting &#8212; have decided, you know, in some cases, not to prosecute minor crimes, such as drug offenses.&nbsp; And they say that&#8217;s what&#8217;s contributed to the rise in crime in some of these cities.&nbsp;<br><br>How do you feel that these efforts will address that particular issues when it comes to prosecuting crimes?&nbsp;<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; So, I will say that the President is giving state and local officials a number of tools to choose from in order to reduce crimes in their communities.&nbsp;<br><br>One of the resources the Justice Department, in its comprehensive strategy it released last month, makes clear that it is deploying U.S. Attorneys, U.S. Marshals, DEA, ATF to help cities that need assistance with investigations and enforcement.&nbsp; He has helped &#8212; those resources will be made available to cities who need support in going after dealer &#8212; gun dealers or other parties that are contributing to gun violence in this country.&nbsp; Because the levels of gun violence in this country are unacceptable and we need action.<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; And again, I just want to add that, you know, our focus is on gun violence.&nbsp; That&#8217;s where the President&#8217;s focus is.&nbsp; That&#8217;s the problem that we&#8217;re seeing right now: Homicide is up 30 percent in 2020 over 2019; up again in the first quarter of this year.&nbsp; That&#8217;s gun violence, primarily.&nbsp; Gun assaults are up.<br><br>When you look &#8212; when you dig into the crime statistics, you see that there are some crimes &#8212; some crimes that are trending down, including property crimes and some low-level crimes.&nbsp; That varies by jurisdiction.&nbsp; But what we are &#8212; where we are seeing the increase is in gun violence.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s why it is &#8212; the gun crime is the centerpiece here &#8212; the focus of the President&#8217;s strategy.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi.&nbsp; Thanks so much for taking my call.&nbsp; I was &#8212; I&#8217;m curious, given that states still have to apply for the Rescue Plan funds, is &#8212; does this represent, tomorrow, any shift in the way that their applications might be considered?&nbsp; If they, for instance, have a greater amount of funding that they&#8217;d like to use for policing versus other initiatives, should this be a signal to cities or to states that are applying for this money that they can change or shift their application in any way?&nbsp; Thanks.<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; I mean, these funds are going out the door.&nbsp; Look at the numbers: $190 billion in the State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds have already been dispersed, and more is going out.&nbsp;<br><br>So the intent here is not to hold jurisdictions to any particular piece of the strategy.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a comprehensive strategy, and it recognizes that local needs need to shape local public safety and gun crime reduction strategies.&nbsp;<br><br>So the guidance that is coming from the Treasury Department that clarifies what ARP funds can be used for includes, you know, a multitude of different public safety strategies that [senior administration official] and I covered &#8212; from policing, to community violence intervention, to summer job programs, to services &#8212; wraparound services, to substance abuse, substance use disorder treatment.&nbsp; These are a variety of strategies that cities will be able to avail themselves of.&nbsp;<br><br>The encouragement here is to use ARP funds to combat gun crime and bring about public safety.<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; And I would just add that we&#8217;ve already heard from cities and states that are eager and excited to have the opportunity to use American Rescue Plan state and local dollars for the types of gun violence reduction strategies that we&#8217;re outlining.&nbsp; And you should expect us to continue to encourage cities and states to take this opportunity, through the American Rescue Plan, to reduce violence in their communities.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi.&nbsp; Thank you so much for the call.&nbsp; I&#8217;m calling from Atlanta, where we have seen, of course, a surge in gun violence, but also a problem with a decrease in police officers on the force and a decrease in morale.&nbsp; I wanted to know how this plan would possibly address that issue with cities that need more officers on the force but, right now, haven&#8217;t had a way to incentivize that?<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Yeah, thanks so much for your question.&nbsp; And I am from Atlanta, so I especially appreciate the question.&nbsp;<br><br>So you have heard the President say again and again that community-oriented policing is one part of a strategy to make our communities safer.&nbsp; The President&#8217;s budget requests $300 million of an increase for the Community-Oriented Policing Services Hiring Programs, and he continues to press for that funding.&nbsp;<br><br>Most immediately, though, what this plan does is: The Treasury is making clear that the &#8212; that cities and states experiencing a surge in gun violence as a result of the pandemic may use their &#8212; a portion of their American Rescue Plan dollars &#8212; the $350 billion in state and local funding &#8212; for purposes that are including hiring law enforcement officials, even above pre-pandemic levels, or paying overtime where the funds are directly focused on advancing community-policing strategies in those communities experiencing an increase in gun violence associated with the pandemic.&nbsp;<br><br>So a city like Atlanta, experiencing a surge in gun violence as a result of a pandemic, could choose to use a portion of their American Rescue Plan dollars to hire more officers or to pay them overtime when those funds would be used to advance community policing.<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; All right, thank you everyone for joining tonight.&nbsp; As a reminder, this call is embargoed until 5:00 a.m., Eastern, tomorrow.&nbsp; And the contents of it are attributable to &#8220;senior Biden administration officials.&#8221;&nbsp;<br><br>If you have any questions, feel free to email me.&nbsp; Again, one final reminder: This is embargoed until 5:00 a.m. Eastern tomorrow.&nbsp;<br><br>Thanks, everyone.&nbsp;<br><br><br>7:45 P.M. EDT</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>President Biden believes that the surge in gun violence that has affected communities across the country over the last year and a half is unacceptable, and his Administration is moving decisively to act with a whole-of-government approach as we enter the summer months when cities typically experience a spike in violence.<br><br>Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing a comprehensive strategy to combat gun violence and other violent crime.&nbsp;This strategy implements preventative measures that are proven to reduce violent crime, and attacks the root causes – including by addressing the flow of firearms used to commit crimes.<br><br>This strategy will use the Rescue Plan’s historic funding levels and clear guidance to help state, local, territorial, and tribal governments get the money they need to put more police officers on the beat – with the resources, training, and accountability they need to engage in effective community policing – in addition to supporting proven Community Violence Intervention programs, summer employment opportunities, and other investments that we know will reduce crime and make our neighborhoods safer.<br><br>The strategy will also address the direct link between gun violence and the rise in violent crime by taking immediate steps to keep guns out of the wrong hands, including by strengthening ATF’s efforts to stem the flow of firearms used in crimes, and by launching multijurisdictional firearms trafficking strike forces to stop illegal gun trafficking across state lines.<br><br>Combined, the Administration’s comprehensive strategy will:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Stem the flow of firearms used to commit violence, including by holding rogue firearms dealers accountable for violating federal laws;</strong></li><li><strong>Support local law enforcement with federal tools and resources to help address summer violent crime;</strong></li><li><strong>Invest in evidence-based community violence interventions;</strong></li><li><strong>Expanding summer programming, employment opportunities, and other services and supports for teenagers and young adults; and</strong></li><li><strong>Help formerly incarcerated individuals successfully reenter their communities.</strong></li></ul>



<p>Now is the time to act. With the secondary consequences of the pandemic and the proliferation of illegal guns over the same period, we have seen increased violence over the past year and a half. <a href="https://cdn.ymaws.com/counciloncj.org/resource/resmgr/covid_commission/Year_End_Crime_Update_Design.pdf">Homicides rose 30%, and gun assaults rose 8% in large cities in 2020.</a> The number of <a href="https://covid19.counciloncj.org/2021/05/21/impact-report-covid-19-and-crime-4/">homicides in the first quarter of 2021</a> was 24% higher than the number of homicides in the first quarter of 2020, and 49% higher than in the first quarter of 2019. Black and brown Americans are <a href="https://efsgv.org/wp-content/uploads/2019CDCdata.pdf">disproportionately harmed</a> by the direct and indirect consequences of gun violence.<br><br>As the President has repeatedly said, we are experiencing an epidemic of gun violence in this country. This violence robs us of loved ones and causes life-altering physical injuries. It causes lasting trauma, with cascading consequences for children, families, and communities. It steals our freedom, our sense of belonging and security, and has ripple effects for our economy.<br><br>The President continues to call on Congress to take action to end this gun violence epidemic. But he knows we cannot afford to wait a single day while lives are being taken, which is why he has already announced a set of initial actions to prevent gun violence – including toughening regulations on ghost guns and moving historically quickly to nominate a permanent ATF Director – in addition to the steps announced today as part of this strategy.<br><br><strong>Stem the Flow of Firearms Used to Commit Violence</strong><br><br>The Biden Administration is taking action to help stem the flow of guns into the hands of those responsible for violence by:<br><br><strong>Establishing zero tolerance for rogue gun dealers that willfully violate the law.</strong> Gun dealers across the country are regulated by federal law that is enforced by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). Dealers that fail to comply with their obligations under the law create risks for all of us. Today, the Justice Department is announcing a new policy to underscore zero tolerance for willful violations of the law by federally licensed firearms dealers that put public safety at risk. Absent extraordinary circumstances that would need to be justified to the Director, ATF will seek to revoke the licenses of dealers the first time that they violate federal law by willfully 1) transferring a firearm to a prohibited person, 2) failing to run a required background check, 3) falsifying records, such as a firearms transaction form, 4) failing to respond to an ATF tracing request, or 5) refusing to permit ATF to conduct an inspection in violation of the law.</p>



<p>In addition, ATF will notify every firearms dealer whose license is revoked about how to lawfully transfer any remaining inventory, as well as the potential criminal consequences of continuing to engage in the business of buying and selling guns without a license. The prior Administration stopped this important notification practice that helps deter future unlawful activity.<br><br><strong>Maximizing the efficacy of ATF resources to crack down on rogue gun dealers violating our laws.</strong>&nbsp;The Administration continues to call on Congress to increase funding for ATF to hire additional personnel necessary to increase the number of inspections and enforcement actions taken against dealers in violation of federal law. The President’s FY 22 budget request would allow ATF to add inspectors in every field division around the country. In the meantime, ATF is announcing the following actions to increase the efficacy of its existing, limited resources:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Better coordination with state and local officials with on-the-ground knowledge of which dealers are supplying firearms that show up at crime scenes.</strong> ATF has designated a specific point of contact in every field division for mayors, police chiefs, or other local leaders to report concerns about particular dealers’ compliance with the law. This information may provide valuable leads for ATF investigations and serve as a source of information that helps focus inspection resources on the places that need them most.<br> </li><li><strong>Formalizing the use of data-driven prioritization of inspection resources.</strong> Starting today, ATF will make clear to investigators in every field division—through trainings and guidance—that when identifying inspection priorities they must consider a number of factors related to public safety, including the extent to which firearms sold by the dealer are later used in criminal activity; the time between the sale of a firearm and its use in a crime; the number of recoveries associated with shootings, domestic violence, and other violent offenses; and additional information developed by local law enforcement partners. This data-driven prioritization will allow ATF to target its limited inspection resources to ensure compliance with federal law.</li><li><strong>Equipping states that have their own gun dealer licensing systems with data from ATF inspections.</strong> Sixteen states license or regulate firearms dealers themselves, and their inspection systems can be force multipliers in protecting public safety. Starting next month, ATF will begin sharing inspection data with these states so that officials there can determine whether to take their own steps to shut down dealers that fail to live up to their obligations under state law.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Launching multijurisdictional firearms trafficking strike forces. </strong>The Biden-Harris Administration recognizes that the federal government has a critical role to play in coordinating multijurisdictional enforcement efforts to stop the illegal flow of firearms across state lines. Yesterday, the Justice Department announced that it is launching five new law enforcement strike forces focused on addressing significant firearms trafficking corridors that have diverted guns to New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, the Bay Area, and Washington, D.C. These strike forces, which will launch within the next 30 days, will be led by designated United States Attorneys who will coordinate not only with ATF but also with state and local law enforcement partners in places where firearms originate and where they are used to commit crimes. The strike forces will share information and otherwise coordinate their efforts across districts where firearms trafficking schemes cross state or jurisdictional boundaries. As part of this effort, ATF is issuing a best practices guide for law enforcement agencies that will include specific questions that officers should ask unlawful firearm possessors to help identify sources of trafficked crime guns.<br><br><strong>Providing the public with additional data to promote transparency and accountability in enforcement of federally licensed firearms dealer policies. </strong>ATF will publicly post more detailed information about inspection findings and enforcement actions. For the first time, this publicly posted data will be disaggregated to show the number of inspections conducted in each field division, the number of inspections that identified violations, and actions taken by ATF to implement the willful-violation policy discussed above (including any application of the extraordinary circumstances exception). This data will promote transparency and accountability for the enforcement of our existing gun laws.<br><strong>Stemming the proliferation of “ghost guns” and modified firearms.</strong> During the April address in the Rose Garden by the President and Attorney General, the Justice Department announced that it was beginning the rulemaking process to help stop the proliferation of dangerous firearms that are currently circumventing our gun laws. The Justice Department has since issued two proposed rules to follow through on this commitment. First, the Justice Department issued a proposed rule to help address the proliferation of “ghost guns,” which are homemade firearms that are increasingly ending up at crime scenes and often cannot be traced by law enforcement due to the lack of a serial number. Second, the Justice Department issued a proposed rule to make clear when a device marketed as a stabilizing brace effectively turns a pistol into a short-barreled rifle subject to the requirements of the National Firearms Act. Modifying a pistol with an arm brace can make a firearm more stable and accurate while still being concealable.</p>



<p><strong>Convening state legislators and Attorneys General regarding policy strategies to hold gun dealers and manufacturers accountable for their contributions to the flow of crime guns.</strong>&nbsp;The President continues to call on Congress to repeal the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), which gives gun dealers and manufacturers special immunity from certain liability for their products. In the meantime, the White House will convene state legislators and Attorneys General to discuss strategies for enacting and employing state liability laws that can be used to hold dealers and manufacturers accountable for improper conduct not covered by PLCAA.</p>



<p>These actions are part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s comprehensive strategy to reduce gun violence through executive action and legislation. For example, earlier this month the Justice Department issued model state “red flag,” or “extreme risk protection order,” legislation. Extreme risk protection order laws allow family members or law enforcement to petition for a court order temporarily barring people in crisis from accessing firearms if they present a danger to themselves or others. The President urges Congress to pass an appropriate national “red flag” law, as well as legislation incentivizing states to pass their own versions of these laws.<br><br>The President again strongly urges the Senate to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, and pass the three House-passed, bipartisan pieces of legislation which would strengthen our gun background check system.<br><br><strong>Provide law enforcement the tools and resources needed to tackle gun violence</strong><br><br>As part of the Justice Department’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-merrick-b-garland-announces-new-effort-reduce-violent-crime"><strong>Comprehensive Strategy for Reducing Violent Crime</strong></a>, the Justice Department is committed to supporting law enforcement in local communities in addressing gun violence. In preparation for a possible increase in violence typically seen over the summer months, where needed and appropriate, the Justice Department is providing the following law enforcement support:</p>



<ul><li>The FBI is making available cutting-edge analytical resources to support state and local law enforcement efforts to identify the most violent offenders and most dangerous criminal organizations in communities. The FBI is also deploying agents to assist with enforcement operations targeting these entities. <br> </li><li>Where feasible, the ATF is embedding with local homicide units and expanding the availability of its National Integrated Ballistic Information Network (NIBIN) Correlation Center, which matches ballistics from crime scenes to other ballistic evidence nationwide.<br> </li><li>The DEA is focusing its efforts, in coordination with state, local and Tribal law enforcement, to disrupt the activities of the most violent drug trafficking gangs and egregious drug-trafficking organizations operating in the highest-crime areas.<br> </li><li>The United States Marshals Service, in coordination with state and local authorities, is conducting fugitive sweeps throughout the country focused on individuals subject to state or local warrants for homicide, aggravated assault with a firearm, aggravated robbery, robbery with a firearm, rape or aggravated sexual assault.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Guidance on Using ARP Funds to Reduce Violence.</strong>&nbsp;Today, the&nbsp;<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/SLFRPFAQ.pdf#page=19">Treasury Department</a>&nbsp;is highlighting that communities experiencing a surge in gun violence as a result of the pandemic may use the American Rescue Plan’s $350 billion in state and local funding for purposes such as:</p>



<ul><li>Hiring law enforcement officials – even above pre-pandemic levels – or paying overtime where the funds are directly focused on advancing community policing strategies in those communities experiencing an increase in gun violence associated with the pandemic.</li><li>Additional enforcement efforts to reduce gun violence exacerbated by the pandemic, including prosecuting gun traffickers, rogue dealers, and other parties contributing to the supply of crime guns, as well as collaborative federal/state/local efforts to identify and address gun trafficking channels.</li><li>Investing in technology and equipment to allow law enforcement to more efficiently and effectively respond to the rise in gun violence resulting from the pandemic.</li></ul>



<p>In addition, the Treasury Department is clarifying that any community may use ARP state and local aid for the above strategies and any other public safety programs, up to the level of revenue loss the jurisdiction experienced during the pandemic. And any community may use ARP funds to rehire police officers and other public servants to restore law enforcement and courts to their pre-pandemic levels.</p>



<p><strong>Byrne JAG Funds. </strong>Applications for the Justice Department’s FY21 $276 million Byrne Justice Assistance Grant program are open now. Byrne JAG provides critical support to State and territory, local, and Tribal governments across a range of program areas, including crime prevention and education, law enforcement, prosecution, indigent defense, courts, corrections and community corrections, drug treatment and enforcement, technology improvement, crime victim and witness initiatives, and planning and evaluation. Community violence intervention programs are eligible uses of the funding.<br><br>In soliciting grant applications for this program, the Department has emphasized the importance of addressing the backlog of cases created when courts at every level were forced to cancel or scale back proceedings due to COVID-19. It has made clear that funds could be used, for example, to purchase technology that would facilitate virtual outreach and appearances, to enhance case management systems, to build tools to support diversion and alternatives to incarceration as part of the review of backlogged cases, or to retrofit courthouses to mitigate risks to staff. <br><br>The President is also seeking a $300 million increase for the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) Hiring program in his recent budget request. These funds will advance community policing and give police the resources they need to keep their communities safe.<br><br><strong>Invest in evidence-based community violence interventions</strong><br><br>Community violence intervention (CVI) programs have been shown to reduce violence by <a href="https://lawcenter.giffords.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Healing-Communities-in-Crisis.pdf">as much as 60%</a>. These programs are effective because they leverage trusted messengers who work directly with individuals most likely to commit gun violence, intervene in conflicts, and connect people to social, health and wellness, and economic services to reduce the likelihood of violence as an answer to conflict.<br><br>Last month, the Treasury Department announced that the American Rescue Plan’s $350 billion in state and local funding can be used to invest in evidence-based community violence interventions. The Department of Education also released guidance clarifying that ARP’s $122 billion in K-12 funds can be used for CVI strategies. To date, the Administration has transferred more than $190 billion of state and local recovery funds and $81 billion in education funds, and additional support is on the way.<br><br>Today, the President is announcing that the Administration will convene and support a CVI Collaborative of 15 jurisdictions that are committing to use a portion of their ARP funding or other public funding to increase investment in their CVI infrastructure, including to anticipate and respond to the potential rise in violence this summer. These jurisdictions include:</p>



<ul><li>Atlanta, GA</li><li>Austin, TX</li><li>Baltimore, MD</li><li>Baton Rouge, LA</li><li>Chicago, IL</li><li>Detroit, MI</li><li>King County, WA</li><li>Los Angeles, CA</li><li>Memphis, TN</li><li>Minneapolis &amp; St. Paul, MN</li><li>Newark, NJ</li><li>Philadelphia, PA</li><li>Rapid City, SD</li><li>St. Louis, MO</li><li>Washington, DC</li></ul>



<p>Over the next 18 months, the Administration will convene meetings with officials from these communities, facilitate peer-to-peer learning, and provide technical assistance. This effort will support both proven and new strategies that reduce gun violence and strengthen community-based infrastructure to enhance public safety for children, families, and communities and to advance equity. A group of philanthropies that have been leaders on this issue will support this collaborative learning network by deploying CVI experts to provide training and technical assistance, identify best practices, integrate proven and innovative public-health approaches, and help local community-based organizations scale CVI efforts this summer and beyond. This group includes:</p>



<ul><li>Arnold Ventures</li><li>The California Endowment</li><li>Annie E. Casey Foundation</li><li>Emerson Collective</li><li>Ford Foundation</li><li>Heising-Simons Foundation</li><li>Joyce Foundation</li><li>W.K. Kellogg Foundation</li><li>Kresge Foundation</li><li>The John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation</li><li>Microsoft Corporation</li><li>Open Society Foundations</li><li>Charles and Lynn Schusterman Family Philanthropies</li></ul>



<p>Domestic Policy Advisor Susan Rice and Director of Intergovernmental Affairs Julie Chavez Rodriguez will convene the first meeting of the CVI Collaborative soon. The President is calling on mayors across the country to follow the lead of these local officials by using their ARP funding or other public funds to launch and strengthen CVI programs in their communities.<br><br>Additionally, the Biden-Harris Administration will convene the first CVI Webinar Series event on June 23. The webinar series will bring together subject matter experts to discuss immediate steps communities and local organizations can take to reduce violence.&nbsp;<br><br>The Administration is continuing to seek a historic $5.2 billion investment in new grant funding for CVI programs through the American Jobs Plan and its FY22 discretionary budget request. The Administration is also executing on its announced changes to 26 programs across five agencies to make federal dollars and technical assistance available to CVI practitioners in the immediate term. For example, this month the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) will publish guidance encouraging jurisdictions to use part of their Community Development Block Grant funds to support CVI efforts needed to combat violence as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. In July and August, the Department of Education will publish guidance explaining that school districts can draw upon the $1.22 billion in Student Support and Academic Enrichment grants and $1.26 billion in 21st Century Community Learning Centers grants to support CVI programs that serve students. This funding will supplement American Rescue Plan funds, providing CVI programs with multiple potential funding streams to expand their work.<br><br><strong>Expand summer programming, employment opportunities, and other services and supports, especially for teenagers and young adults</strong><br><br><strong>American Rescue Plan Funds.</strong>&nbsp;The Administration released guidance from the&nbsp;<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/SLFRPFAQ.pdf#page=19">Department of the Treasury</a>&nbsp;today and from the&nbsp;<a href="https://oese.ed.gov/files/2021/06/21-0130-ARP-Public-Safety-ED-FAQ-06-16-2021.pdf">Department of Education</a>&nbsp;last week explaining how two buckets of American Rescue Plan funding—$350 billion in state and local funding and the $122 billion in school funding—can be used for a variety of public safety strategies. Within the parameters explained in those guidance documents, State and territory, local, and Tribal governments can:</p>



<ul><li>Hire support personnel such as nurses, counselors, and social workers;</li><li>Pay court personnel and operations costs to return to pre-pandemic operation levels;</li><li>Provide and expand employment services, including summer jobs for young people and programs that provide training and work experience for formerly incarcerated persons and other individuals who live in communities most impacted by high levels of violence;</li><li>Provide and expand summer education and enrichment programs, including summer camp;</li><li>Scale up wraparound services—such as housing, medical and mental health care, trauma-informed care, substance use disorder treatment, food assistance, and job placement services—for victims of crime, young people, formerly incarcerated persons, and individuals and households facing economic insecurity due to the pandemic; and</li><li>Establish or expand full-service community schools.</li></ul>



<p>The President urges jurisdictions to use these resources now for strategies to prevent violence.<br><br><strong>Youth Workforce Development Funds.</strong> Young people are disproportionately likely to be involved in gun violence, either as perpetrators or victims. We also know that youth employment programs, including summer jobs programs, can reduce their involvement in violence by as much as <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/metro_2018jan_how-can-summer-jobs-reduce-crime-among-youth-final.pdf">35%</a> or <a href="https://www.ojp.gov/pdffiles1/ojjdp/grants/251101.pdf">45%</a>. The Biden Administration is committed to funding workforce development programs to keep young people safe and give them a path to success.<br><br>On June 10, the Department of Labor awarded $89 million through its YouthBuild program to provide pre-apprenticeship opportunities for young people ages 16-24. 68 grantee organizations will serve more than 5,000 youth in dozens of cities. The young people will split their time between workplace training and the classroom, where they earn their high school diploma or equivalency degree and prepare for postsecondary opportunities. The grants support training and employment in in-demand industries, including construction, healthcare, information technology, manufacturing, logistics, and hospitality. YouthBuild includes a significant wrap-around support system, such as mentoring, trauma-informed care, follow-up education, employment, and personal counseling services.<br><br>The Department of Labor on June 10 also awarded $20 million through its Workforce Pathways for Youth program to expand workforce development activities that serve youth ages 14-21 during “out of school” time (non-school hours). Through these grants, four national grantee organizations will serve approximately 7,000 participants in multiple cities across the country. The organizations will provide career exploration services; work readiness training; career counseling; work experience (internships, summer and year-round employment, pre-apprenticeships, and registered apprenticeships); mentoring; and assistance in placing youth in employment, education, or training.<br><br><strong>Help formerly incarcerated individuals successfully reenter their communities</strong><br><br>Formerly incarcerated individuals face an uphill climb in landing a job. Many employers are reluctant to hire them out of stigma, fear, or concern that they lack the skills needed for the job. But employment is a key to formerly incarcerated individuals’ successful reentry into their communities. Individuals who secure employment after release have much lower recidivism rates than those who do not. Good, stable jobs promote public safety. That is why the Administration is taking concrete steps to facilitate employment and associated services, such as housing assistance, for people who are formerly incarcerated.<br><br><strong>Investments to help formerly incarcerated individuals find quality jobs. </strong>On June 21, the <a href="https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/eta/eta20210621">Department of Labor awarded $85.5 million</a> to help formerly incarcerated adults and young people in 28 communities transition out of the criminal justice system and connect with quality jobs. This includes $60 million for Pathway Home projects that will serve approximately 6,000 adults. By enabling services to begin while participants are still incarcerated and continue services post-release, the Pathway Home initiative eliminates the gap between release from incarceration and enrollment into a reentry program. Participants are taught job readiness and job search strategies and receive apprenticeships and occupational training. The Department also awarded $25.5 million in Young Adult Reentry Partnership grants to organizations that will help provide education and training services to young adults between 18-24 who were previously involved with the justice system or who left high school before graduation. The program will serve approximately 3,000 young people, offering accelerated and work-based learning such as registered apprenticeships in high-demand occupations with living wages. Grantees reduce barriers to labor market entry by providing career exploration activities, case management services, legal and other supportive services, and both job preparation and placement. Priority was given to organizations serving communities with high rates of poverty and crime.<br><br><strong>Expanding Federal Hiring of Formerly Incarcerated Persons:</strong> The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) will evaluate the existence of any barriers faced by formerly incarcerated persons in accessing federal employment and consider whether the federal government should take further action as appropriate, including creating a new “Schedule A” excepted service hiring authority for formerly incarcerated persons. This Schedule A hiring authority would allow federal agencies to hire qualified individuals for any job opening through the non-competitive, excepted service hiring process. Schedule A appointments are one-year temporary appointments with good benefits that can be extended for an additional year. Schedule A positions equip people with the skills and experience to become more competitive in the job market. Schedule A hiring authority has previously been created for veterans, people with disabilities, individuals on work release from incarceration, and people hired in direct response to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.<br><br><strong>Implementing “ban the box” policy.</strong> OPM will also publish proposed regulations to implement the Fair Chance to Compete for Jobs Act of 2019’s “ban the box” policy. The Fair Chance Act prohibits federal employers and federal contractors in all three branches of government from inquiring into arrest and conviction history until they have made a conditional job offer.<br><br><strong>Hiring Second Chance Act Fellow. </strong>The Department of Justice plans to post an application next month for a formerly incarcerated individual to work at DOJ as a Second Chance Act visiting fellow. This is a unique opportunity to draw on the expertise of a formerly incarcerated person as a policy advocate, legal or social services provider, or academic focusing on the successful reintegration of people returning home to their communities after incarceration. The fellow will develop innovative strategies that build upon and improve DOJ’s investments in reentry and reintegration. <br><br><strong>Leveraging tax credits to incentivize hiring of formerly incarcerated individuals. </strong>The Department of Labor and Department of the Treasury will help employers leverage the Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC), which includes incentivizes to hire formerly incarcerated individuals. Under WOTC, employers can receive up to a $2,400 credit against federal income taxes for hiring a person within one year of their conviction or release from prison for a felony offense. The Departments of Labor and Treasury will encourage employers to take up this opportunity to hire formerly incarcerated individuals. Specifically, within 90 days, the Departments will issue guidance, provide technical assistance to state workforce agencies, and release materials on ways employers can leverage this tax credit and other resources, such as the Federal Bonding Program and the American Rescue Plan’s Employee Retention Credit (ERC). For example, a small business that hires someone who was released in the last twelve months and employs them through the second half of the year could qualify for a credit of up to $16,400 per worker by claiming both the WOTC and the ERC. The Department of the Treasury will also revise online materials to make it easier to claim the tax credit.<br><br><strong>Addressing the housing needs of returning citizens. </strong>Today, HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge is issuing a <a href="https://www.hud.gov/sites/dfiles/PA/documents/SOHUD_reentry_housing_letter.pdf">letter</a> outlining actions that HUD is taking to improve public safety by addressing the housing needs of returning citizens, including through the recently awarded 70,000 emergency housing vouchers funded by the American Rescue Plan. The letter clarifies that returning citizens that are at-risk of homelessness are among the eligible populations for these emergency housing vouchers and encourages public housing authorities and their Continuum of Care partners to ensure that eligible returning citizens are given consideration for these vouchers. The letter also discusses additional steps that HUD is taking to improve access to housing for returning citizens and people with criminal records.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Via Teleconference </p>



<p>12:35 P.M. EDT</p>



<p>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Good morning, and thanks for joining us.&nbsp; We&#8217;re joined by Drs. Fauci, Walensky, and Murthy, who I will turn to in a few moments.<br><br>First, today, I want to report on the progress we are making in our fight to end the pandemic, specifically as it relates to the President’s goals for July 4th.<br><br>In March, on the one-year anniversary of the start of the pandemic and less than two months after taking office, President Biden provided Americans an update on the whole-of-government effort he was mobilizing to defeat the virus and set what, at the time, seemed like an audacious goal for the country: independence from COVID-19 by July 4th.<br><br>The President was clear about what achieving this very ambitious goal would require.&nbsp; First, we needed to build on the work we began on January 20th, taking additional bold steps to make vaccines even more accessible to all Americans and to further accelerate the pace of vaccinations.<br><br>And second, we needed “every American to do their part.”&nbsp; He said, quote, “If we do all this, if we do our part, if we do this together, by July the 4th, there’s a good chance you, your families, and friends will be able to get together in your backyard or in your neighborhood and have a cookout and celebrate Independence Day.”&nbsp; He said that this would not mean large events with lots of people together, but rather with small groups of close friends and family.&nbsp;<br><br>Just three months later, look at where we are.&nbsp; We have succeeded beyond our highest expectations.&nbsp; Instead of just small, backyard gatherings, America is getting ready for a truly historic Fourth of July, with large celebrations planned in communities across the country.<br><br>Here at the White House, we will be celebrating our independence from the virus with over 1,000 people on the White House lawn &#8212; 1,000 of our nation’s military and frontline workers celebrating how far we have come as a country in such a short period of time.&nbsp;<br><br>And here’s why we are able to do so: Since the President took office, COVID-19 cases and deaths are down by over 90 percent.&nbsp; Nearly every state is open for most activities, and the economy is rebounding strongly.<br><br>Importantly, today I am announcing exciting news.&nbsp; We have already met the President’s 70 percent goal for all U.S. adults 30 and older.&nbsp; That’s right: For those ages 30 and above, 70 percent have at least one shot.<br><br>We got here because the President treated this as a wartime effort; built a whole-of-government response to defeat the pandemic; and mobilized state and local governments, the private and non-profit sectors, and asked every American to join this fight.<br><br>In the past 150 days, we went from not having enough supply to securing supply &#8212; enough supply to vaccinate all Americans and making every adult eligible for vaccinations months ahead of expectations.<br><br>We went from not having enough places to get vaccinated to more than 81,000 convenient vaccination sites.&nbsp; In fact, today, 90 percent of Americans live within five miles of a vaccine site.&nbsp; Tens of thousands of sites offer walk-in vaccinations, and thousands are open 24 hours a day on Fridays in June.<br><br>And Americans have new tools to find the most convenient vaccination sites and free transportation to get to and from sites.<br><br>We have built an unparalleled, first-of-its-kind, nationwide vaccination program.&nbsp; And as a result, we have successfully executed the most complex, logistical task: administering 300 million shots in just 150 days.<br><br>To put that into perspective, at the pace the U.S. was vaccinating before the President took office, it would have taken 336 days &#8212; almost a year &#8212; to get 300 million shots in arms.&nbsp;<br><br>Instead of hitting the major milestone of 300 million shots in June, we would have hit it in December &#8212; six months from now.&nbsp; And America would have looked a lot different than it does today.&nbsp; We would have lost more lives; more people would have gotten sick; and many of our businesses, restaurants, and schools would still be closed.<br><br>The President understood that we did not have a day to waste, and we have moved at an unprecedented speed.&nbsp;<br><br>Importantly, Americans have responded to the President’s call.&nbsp; More than 175 million Americans have rolled up their sleeves and gotten at least one shot, and over 150 million Americans are now fully vaccinated.&nbsp;<br><br>As a result, we are close to achieving two aspirational goals we set for July 4th. &nbsp;The first goal was related to the percentage of adults who have at least one shot by July 4th.&nbsp; We asked Americans, state and local governments, and the private sector to help get to 70 percent of all adults with at least one shot by July 4th.&nbsp; Sixteen states and the District of Columbia have already met this goal.&nbsp;<br><br>And let’s remember, when the President took office, we were at approximately 5 percent of adults with one shot.&nbsp; So, in just five months, we have been racing from 5 percent to 70 percent.<br><br>So, how are we doing?&nbsp; Today, I want to drill down on the numbers that show where we have made the most progress and where we have more work to do.<br><br>We set 70 percent of adults as our aspirational target, and we have met or exceeded it for most of the adult population.&nbsp; This is a remarkable achievement.<br><br>When we began our vaccination campaign, we prioritized the most vulnerable.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s clear from the numbers that this strategy has worked.&nbsp; Looking at Americans 65 and older &#8212; our most at-risk group &#8212; we have more than 87 percent with at least one shot.&nbsp; Again, 87 percent of seniors, who tragically accounted for about 80 percent of COVID deaths, have gotten at least one shot.&nbsp; And today, nearly 80 percent of people 65 and older are fully vaccinated.&nbsp; That’s lifesaving progress.<br><br>For Americans who are 40 years old and over, 75 percent have received at least one shot.&nbsp; For Americans 30 and older, we have met the President’s goal of at least one shot.&nbsp; That’s right: We have met the President’s 70 percent goal for all U.S. adults 30 and over.<br><br>And based on today’s estimates, we&#8217;re on track to hit the 70 percent target for those age 27 and over once the data for the July 4th holiday weekend is fully in.&nbsp;<br><br>So, as to our goal of 70 percent for all adults, we’re going to hit it for adults 27 and older.&nbsp; This is amazing progress and has our country returning to normal much sooner than anyone could have predicted.&nbsp;<br><br>Where the country has more work to do is particularly with 18- to 26-year-olds.&nbsp; The reality is: Many younger Americans have felt like COVID-19 is not something that impacts them and they&#8217;ve been less eager to get the shot.<br><br>However, with the Delta variant now spreading across the country and infecting younger people worldwide, it&#8217;s more important than ever that they get vaccinated.<br><br>We are working with state and local leaders to reach them.&nbsp; We think it&#8217;ll take a few extra weeks to get to 70 percent of all adults with at least one shot, with the 18- to 26-years-olds factored in.<br><br>So, to recap: With respect to the first goal of getting at least one shot to 70 percent of American adults, already we&#8217;re at almost 90 percent for 65 and older, over 75 percent for 40 and older, and 70 percent for 30 and older.<br><br>We will meet the 70 percent goal for ages 27 and older by end of July 4th weekend, with a few extra weeks needed for the 18- to 26-year-olds to get vaccinated.<br><br>Now, everyone involved in this effort knows, and the President has said repeatedly: Our work does not stop on July 4th or at 70 percent.&nbsp; But we used this aspirational goal to drive progress in a very short period of time.&nbsp; It has taken a huge collective effort, and we have made significant progress.<br><br>The second aspirational goal we set was to have 160 million Americans fully vaccinated by July 4th.&nbsp; For context, only 3 million Americans were fully vaccinated when the President came into office. &nbsp;<br><br>In just five months, we&#8217;ve grown that number from 3 million to over 150 million fully vaccinated Americans.&nbsp; That represents more than 56 percent of the adult population.&nbsp; This is important progress across the country.&nbsp; And we will hit 160 million Americans fully vaccinated no later than mid-July.&nbsp;<br><br>Throughout the last five months, the President has set goals to rally the American people behind defeating this virus, with the most important and most ambitious being to celebrate our independence from the virus on July 4th &#8212; for America to look like America again.&nbsp; And thanks the President&#8217;s whole-of-government effort and the American people stepping up to do their part, we are there.&nbsp;<br><br>The virus is in retreat in communities across the country.&nbsp; We are entering a summer of joy, a summer of freedom.&nbsp; This is cause for celebration, and that&#8217;s exactly what Americans will be able to do on July 4th: celebrate independence from the virus.&nbsp;<br><br>But we&#8217;re not done, because for all the progress we&#8217;ve made as a nation, individuals who are still unvaccinated are still at risk.&nbsp; We are not leaving anyone behind in our response.&nbsp; And we will continue to put equity at the center of everything we do, to focus on helping at-risk and hard-hit communities drive up vaccination rates.&nbsp;<br><br>We want every American in every community to be protected and free from fear of the virus.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why we&#8217;ll keep working to vaccinate more Americans across the summer and into the fall.&nbsp; As I said, we are not stopping at 70 percent, and we&#8217;re not stopping on July 4th.&nbsp;<br><br>And as we push to get more Americans vaccinated, we&#8217;re also focused on leading the efforts to vaccinate the world.&nbsp; We&#8217;re in a position to do so because of our success here at home and because we&#8217;ve secured enough supply &#8212; more than enough supply for all Americans.&nbsp;<br><br>In the last week alone, we have shipped millions of surplus U.S doses overseas, including to our neighbors in Mexico and Canada, as well as Taiwan.&nbsp; In total, we&#8217;ve already committed to sharing 580 million doses, and we expect to continue to commit more and more to the world over the summer months as we help lead the fight to end the pandemic across the globe.&nbsp;<br><br>Now to say more about why the progress we are making here at home matters, let me turn it over to Dr. Fauci.&nbsp;<br><br>Dr. Fauci.<br><br>DR. FAUCI:&nbsp; Thank you very much, Jeff.&nbsp; I&#8217;m going to just spend a few minutes now recapitulating what Jeff said about where we are, where we want to be, and how we get there, and what the obstacles are.&nbsp;<br><br>And can I have the first slide.<br><br>As Jeff has said, our aspirational goal for July 4th was 70 percent of the adult population receiving at least one dose, but that is not the goal line, nor is it the endgame.&nbsp; The endgame is to go well beyond that, beyond July 4th, into the summer and beyond, with the ultimate goal of crushing the outbreak completely in the United States.&nbsp;<br><br>Now, what are one of the main obstacles for that?&nbsp; Obviously, it&#8217;s under-vaccinated people and under-vaccinated regions of the country, particularly among the young and, as Jeff said, particularly among individuals 18 to 26 &#8212; although any age of an unvaccinated person is someone we need to get vaccinated as we concentrate on the younger.&nbsp;<br><br>Next slide.&nbsp;<br><br>If you take a look, for example &#8212; can I have the next slide, please.&nbsp; There are 16 states, plus the District of Columbia, have vaccinated greater than 70 percent; 4 U.S. states vaccinated less than 50.&nbsp; And so between them, you have 30 states between 50 and more than 70 percent.&nbsp; And those are the individuals that we need to concentrate on.&nbsp;<br><br>But let&#8217;s take a look at what the challenge is. &nbsp;<br><br>Next slide.&nbsp;<br><br>If you look at the growing threat of what we&#8217;re all concerned about: the Delta variant.&nbsp; What do we know about that variant?&nbsp; The transmissibility is unquestionably greater than the wild-type SARS-CoV-2, as well as the Alpha variant.&nbsp; It is associated with an increased disease severity, as reflected by hospitalization risk, compared to Alpha.&nbsp; And in lab tests, associated with modest decreased neutralization by sera from previously infected and vaccinated individuals.&nbsp; But efficacy, as I&#8217;ll get to in a moment, is something that has held up.&nbsp;<br><br>Next slide.&nbsp;<br><br>Let&#8217;s take a look at the UK, because we have followed the UK in so many respects, with regard to the B117 Alpha.&nbsp; But look at what&#8217;s happened to the UK from February to June &#8212; i.e., this month.&nbsp; The gray shading was the B117 &#8212; the Alpha.&nbsp; Look at how the Delta &#8212; in red &#8212; completely began to dominate the isolates throughout the UK, to the point where it&#8217;s well over 95 percent now.<br><br>Next slide.<br><br>Among whom is this taking place?&nbsp; The Imperial College of London did a study in over 100,000 homes, and looked and found that youth were driving the UK surge, with a fivefold higher positivity among children 5 to 12 and young adults 18 to 24, versus people older than 65 years old.&nbsp;<br><br>Next slide.&nbsp;<br><br>Look at what&#8217;s happening in the United States.&nbsp; We seem, as was the case with B117 &#8212; we seem to be following the pattern with the Delta variant, with a doubling time of about two weeks if you look from the May 8th with 1.2, to 2.7, to 9.9, and as of a couple of days ago, 20.6 percent of the isolates are Delta.&nbsp;<br><br>Next slide.&nbsp;<br><br>Here is now some of the good news and one of our tools.&nbsp; The effectiveness of the vaccines &#8212; in this case, two weeks after the second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech &#8212; was 88 percent effective against the Delta and 93 percent effective against the Alpha when you&#8217;re dealing with symptomatic disease.&nbsp;<br><br>Next slide.&nbsp;<br><br>When you look at hospitalizations, again, both the Pfizer-BioNTech and the Oxford-AstraZeneca are between 92 and 96 percent effective against hospitalizations.&nbsp;<br><br>You put all of these things together, and you come to what we would call a &#8220;self-evident conclusion.&#8221;&nbsp;<br><br>Next and last slide.<br><br>Similar to the situation in the UK, the Delta variant is currently the greatest threat in the U.S. to our attempt to eliminate COVID-19.&nbsp; Good news: Our vaccines are effective against the Delta variant.&nbsp;<br><br>Conclusion: We have the tools, so let&#8217;s use them and crush the outbreak.&nbsp;<br><br>I&#8217;ll hand it now over to Dr. Walensky.&nbsp;<br><br>DR. WALENSKY:&nbsp; Thank you, Dr. Fauci.&nbsp; And good afternoon, everyone.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s begin with an overview of the data.&nbsp; Yesterday, CDC reported 9,816 new cases of COVID-19, and our seven-day average is about 10,350 cases per day.&nbsp; This represents a decrease of nearly 18 percent from the prior seven-day average and is the lowest seven-day average since March 25th, 2020.<br><br>The seven-day average of hospital admissions is about 1,790 per day, a decrease of about 14 percent from the prior seven-day period.<br><br>And the seven-day average of daily deaths have also declined to 273 per day.&nbsp;<br><br>These numbers demonstrate the extraordinary progress we&#8217;ve made against a formidable foe.&nbsp; Thanks to our vaccination programs, we are seeing a dramatic decline in deaths, hospitalization, and cases.&nbsp; And we will continue to vaccinate people across the summer months.<br><br>COVID-19 vaccines are available for everyone ages 12 and up.&nbsp; They are nearly 100 percent effective against severe disease and death, meaning nearly every death due to COVID-19 is particularly tragic because nearly every death, especially among adults, due to COVID-19 is, at this point, entirely preventable.&nbsp;<br><br>This new virus forced too many of our families to accept death as an outcome for too many of our loved ones, but now this should not be the case.&nbsp; As more Americans have rolled up their sleeves to get vaccinated, we have chipped away at the ability of the COVID-19 virus to cause more illness and more suffering.&nbsp; As I&#8217;ve often said, this virus is an opportunist.&nbsp; As long as there are those who are not vaccinated, COVID-19 will remain a threat.&nbsp;<br><br>CDC continues to follow the prevalence of the Delta variant of COVID-19, as you&#8217;ve just heard.&nbsp; In the last two weeks, the prevalence of cases resulting from the Delta variant has doubled to just over 20 percent, as Dr. Fauci just showed.<br><br>This variant represents nearly half of all infections in HHS Regions 7 and 8.&nbsp; This is concerning but expected, knowing what we do about how efficiently this variant spreads and by what we saw in the United Kingdom with this variant.&nbsp;<br><br>We know our vaccines work against this variant.&nbsp; However, this variant represents a set of mutations that could lead to future mutations that evade our vaccine.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s more important than ever to get vaccinated now, to stop the chain of infection, the chain of mutations that could lead to a more dangerous variant.&nbsp;<br><br>While not everyone with COVID-19 may require hospitalization at the time of their infection, one of the unfortunate outcomes from COVID-19 is something known as &#8220;post-COVID conditions&#8221; or &#8220;long COVID.&#8221;&nbsp; Post-COVID conditions are an umbrella term for the wide range of physical and mental health problems that occur four or more weeks after being infected with COVID-19.&nbsp; Current research suggests that up to 20 percent of people are reporting post-COVID condition symptoms, but additional research is needed and is ongoing with funding from NIH and CDC.&nbsp;<br><br>Even people who did not have symptoms when they were infected can have post-COVID conditions.&nbsp; Symptoms may vary and may include fatigue, brain fog, headache, loss of smell or taste, dizziness on standing, heart palpitations, chest pain, difficulty breathing, cough, joint or muscle pain, depression and anxiety and insomnia.&nbsp; These symptoms can persist for weeks or months after first being infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, or appear weeks after infection.&nbsp; For some people, they can be severely debilitating.&nbsp;<br><br>A recent study published in MMWR found that two out of three adults who had COVID-19 and were not hospitalized for their initial illness went on to have at least one outpatient visit for symptoms &#8212; such as chest or throat pain, shortness of breath, fatigue, and cough &#8212; one to six months after they were initially diagnosed with COVID-19.&nbsp;<br><br>The study also found that more than one in three patients had to be referred to a specialist, such as doctors that specialize in pulmonology, neurology, cardiology, and behavioral or mental health.&nbsp; In other words, even patients who were not hospitalized for COVID-19 infection were commonly referred for additional evaluation for COVID-19-related symptoms and conditions after their initial illness.&nbsp; We have seen post-COVID conditions in people of all ages, and this makes it even more important for anyone who is eligible to get vaccinated.&nbsp;<br><br>There are many benefits of vaccination, including preventing serious illness &#8212; illness and death, but also the kind of long-term effects associated with post-COVID conditions.&nbsp;<br><br>I invite you to visit the CDC website to review new information to help healthcare professionals in evaluating caring for patients with post-COVID conditions.&nbsp; CDC is continuing to work to identify how common these longer-term effects are, who is the most likely to get them, and whether symptoms eventually resolve.&nbsp;<br><br>Multi-year studies are also on their &#8212; underway that will help us better understand post-COVID conditions and understand how to treat patients with these longer-term effects.&nbsp;<br><br>Thank you, all.&nbsp; And now, I&#8217;ll now turn things over to Dr. Murthy.<br><br>SURGEON GENERAL MURTHY:&nbsp; Well thank you so much, Dr. Walensky.&nbsp; As you &#8212; Jeff laid out for us, we&#8217;ve made remarkable progress in the last six months to get people vaccinated.&nbsp; And our work isn&#8217;t done yet, especially among young adults, 18- to 29-year-olds.&nbsp; Today, I want to talk about what we&#8217;ve been doing to increase our efforts to connect with them, and to ensure that they know that they can and should get vaccinated.&nbsp;<br><br>First, we focused on connecting directly with students in this age group through the COVID-19 College Challenge that was launched for the Month of Action.&nbsp; Colleges and Universities are now taking part in a pledge to commit to take action to get their students and communities vaccinated.&nbsp; Over 700 colleges and universities have already signed the pledge.&nbsp;<br><br>And last week, we launched this Student Community Corps, where students participate in biweekly calls to learn best practices and hear from their peers about how they can talk to friends, family members, and other community members about getting vaccinated.&nbsp;<br><br>Second, we&#8217;ve also partnered with companies nationwide who are offering incentives for young people.&nbsp; This includes major sports leagues, which are offering discounts and ticket giveaways; Spotify, which has launched a sweepstakes giveaway for tickets to independent music venues.&nbsp; It includes stores that are now offering free items when a customer shows their vaccination cards.&nbsp; And, as of today, Walgreens is giving every person who comes in to get a vaccine between now and July 4th a $25 gift card.<br><br>Third, we also know that misinformation continues to be rampant on many online platforms that young people visit, which is why we&#8217;re meeting them there with accurate information through trusted messengers about the COVID-19 vaccine.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve launched media campaigns to reach different communities with this &#8212; within this age group, including our Digital Day of Action, which reached more than 280 million people across Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, plus the celebrity PSAs on more than 850 radio stations.&nbsp;<br><br>We&#8217;ve organized Instagram Lives with influencers and a YouTube townhall where influencers and creators are in conversation with public figures and doctors, including those of us on this press conference and President Biden.&nbsp;<br><br>And we&#8217;re also meeting gamers where they are.&nbsp; Riot Games has been airing Vaccine.gov PSAs on their E-game livestreams, and is working on other ways to connect with young people on video game platforms.&nbsp;<br><br>In addition to all of this, we are asking all young people to have conversations with friends and family members, encouraging their communities to get vaccinated and actually helping them then get to a vaccination site, which you can do more easily than ever before, given how many sites we have and how easy it is to find them at Vaccines.gov, or by texting your ZIP Code to GETVAX or to VACUNA.&nbsp;<br><br>You know, when we look back at our history as a country, it&#8217;s clear that so many of our most meaningful movements for change have been led by young people, whether it&#8217;s the Civil Rights Movement or our original fight for independence in America.&nbsp;<br><br>And this generation of young adults has shown, time and time again, their incredible energy and power to drive change.&nbsp; Today, they have the power to get vaccinated, to help their family and friends get vaccinated, and to help protect our nation.&nbsp; I believe they will rise to the challenge, and we will be there to work with them and to support them at every step of the way.&nbsp;<br><br>Thank you all.&nbsp; And I&#8217;ll turn it back over to Jeff.<br><br>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Wonderful.&nbsp; Thank you, Doctors.&nbsp; Now let&#8217;s open it up for a few questions.&nbsp;<br><br>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Thanks, Jeff.&nbsp; We only have time for a few questions today.&nbsp; But first, we&#8217;re going to go to Sharon LaFraniere, New York Times.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Sorry, I had to unmute.&nbsp; So I&#8217;d like to ask what will happen this winter if there continues to be a solid 20 to 30 percent of the adults who refuse to get vaccinated?&nbsp; Could there be a renewed surge?&nbsp; Could we even get back up to like 1,000 daily deaths?&nbsp; Or are those days behind us?<br><br>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Dr. Fauci.<br><br>DR. FAUCI:&nbsp; If there is a persistence of a recalcitrant group that doesn&#8217;t get vaccinated, there will be local type of regional spikes and outbreaks.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t foresee what we refer to a surge as we have known it, namely the three major surges that we&#8217;ve experienced over the past year and a half.&nbsp;<br><br>I don&#8217;t think, even under those circumstances, that you&#8217;re going to see things like 1,000 deaths a day.&nbsp; I think that is a bit much.&nbsp; But there is a danger &#8212; a real danger &#8212; that if there is a persistence of a recalcitrance to getting vaccinated, that you could see localized surges, which is the reason why I want to emphasize what all four of us have said: All of that is totally and completely avoidable by getting vaccinated.&nbsp;<br><br>So, the very fact that you bring up the question, which means there&#8217;s a reality that that could happen, should hopefully stimulate people to appreciate that they have, within their own wherewithal, to prevent that from happening to get vaccinated.&nbsp;<br><br>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; And I would just add: With 70 percent of people over 30 already with at least one dose; with 54 percent of Americans &#8212; adult Americans &#8212; fully vaccinated, we have a very strong platform to build off of.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re going to continue to vaccinate millions and millions more Americans across the coming months.&nbsp;<br><br>Next question.<br><br>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Kaitlan, CNN.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks so much for doing this.&nbsp; Since we&#8217;re not going to hit this goal now of 70 percent with one shot by July 4th, can you say when you do expect to hit that goal?<br><br>And then, secondly, I noticed there&#8217;s been a lot of focus on the milestones that they&#8217;ve hit so far.&nbsp; Should we expect any new goals on vaccinations going forward from the administration?<br><br>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; So, Kaitlan, just to summarize where we are: We&#8217;re already at people ov- &#8212; 30 and over, we&#8217;re at 70 percent.&nbsp; By July 4th, we&#8217;ll be over 70 percent for 27 and over.&nbsp; And within a few weeks, we will be over 70 percent &#8212; 70 percent or over for the whole adult population.&nbsp; And then we&#8217;re going to continue to drive across the summer and into the early fall to vaccinate more and more people.&nbsp;<br><br>I&#8217;ll leave it to the President to set an additional goal.&nbsp; He&#8217;s our goal-setter, and he&#8217;s done a great job at setting aspirational and ambitious goals that have really driven our success.&nbsp;<br><br>SURGEON GENERAL MURTHY:&nbsp; If I could just add one thing to this and &#8212; thinking of it as just as we do in medicine when we&#8217;re taking care of patients, you know, you pay attention to numbers &#8212; like (inaudible) values and other numbers that are important &#8212; but the most important thing at the end of the day is: How&#8217;s the patient doing?&nbsp; How are they feeling?&nbsp; What can they do?<br><br>And similarly, when we think about this effort, the most important goal that we&#8217;re focused on is: What can people in our country do as a result of this vaccination effort?&nbsp; And there, I think what&#8217;s been encouraging to me and so many of us is that we have actually exceeded where we thought we would be.&nbsp;<br><br>We thought people would be able to get together, have barbecues again if they were vaccinated.&nbsp; We are finding now, given the progress we&#8217;ve made thanks to the hard work of people all over this country, that we can not only do that, but if you&#8217;re vaccinated, you can be part of large gatherings.&nbsp; You can participate in so much more of life that we have missed out on over the last year.&nbsp;<br><br>So I think it&#8217;s just important to keep in mind that the most important metric at the end of the day is: What are we able to do in our lives?&nbsp; How much of &#8220;normal&#8221; have we been able to recapture?<br><br>And I think what we are seeing now is that we have exceeded our expectations.&nbsp; That we&#8217;ve just got to keep going because, until everybody is under that umbrella of protection, until everyone has their way of life back, we&#8217;re not going to stop in our vaccination effort.&nbsp;<br><br>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Dr. Murthy, I couldn&#8217;t agree more. &nbsp;We are going to have a Fourth of July celebration which is beyond everyone&#8217;s highest expectations.&nbsp;<br><br>Next question.&nbsp;<br><br>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Let&#8217;s got to Nancy Cordes at CBS.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you so much.&nbsp; I&#8217;d love to hear from any of you about how you came up with the 70 percent goal in the first place.&nbsp; What led you to that particular number?&nbsp; And what do you think is the main thing that kept you from getting over that finish line?&nbsp; Did you assume that young people would get vaccinated in larger numbers than they have?&nbsp; That would be great.&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp;<br><br>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; So, we did that as a team, relying very heavily or exclusively on the docs and scientists &#8212; many of whom are on this call.&nbsp;<br><br>Dr. Fauci, why don&#8217;t I turn it to you as to the 70 percent and where we are relative to Fourth of July and where we&#8217;re headed.&nbsp;<br><br>Dr. Fauci.&nbsp;<br><br>DR. FAUCI:&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; As some of you may remember, when we were talking about this concept of herd immunity and I repetitively said, &#8220;We don&#8217;t know what that number is, but you can make a reasonable intelligent estimate that it&#8217;s somewhere between 70 and 85 percent.&#8221;&nbsp; Because, remember, herd immunity is a combination of individuals who are vaccinated and individuals who are protected from &#8212; because of prior infection.&nbsp;<br><br>The lower number of that was 70.&nbsp; It seemed like a reasonable number to do.&nbsp; It was empiric.&nbsp; I mean, there was no mathematical certainty to it, but I think most &#8212; not &#8220;I think&#8221; &#8212; I know that most of us agreed that that was quite a reasonable number.<br><br>You did say something that&#8217;s interesting.&nbsp; You said &#8220;reached the goal line.&#8221;&nbsp; That&#8217;s not the goal line; that&#8217;s the aspirational goal.&nbsp; The goal line is to completely crush this outbreak, and that&#8217;s the endgame that I showed on my first slide.&nbsp;<br><br>So no one should think that when we reach this 70 percent across the country that we&#8217;re done.&nbsp; We are not done until we completely crush this outbreak.&nbsp;<br><br>DR. WALENSKY:&nbsp; And maybe just to emphasize the importance of the second dose.&nbsp; So, the 70 percent is the first-dose benchmark, but we also want people to get the second dose for their two-dose vaccines.&nbsp;<br><br>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; One more question.&nbsp;<br><br>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Yep.&nbsp; Zeke, AP.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks for doing this.&nbsp; For those four states that haven&#8217;t even reached 50 percent of their &#8212; of their adult population yet, vaccinated: Is the White House looking at a different approach to those states?&nbsp; Is there &#8212; you know, we&#8217;ve heard those governors, saying they&#8217;re not &#8212; you know, it&#8217;s a personal choice for folks who are not quite &#8212; you know, is there a &#8212; should we expect to see a different strategy from you all going forward?<br><br>And then, secondly, after July 4th, a lot of these incentive programs run out.&nbsp; To Dr. Walensky&#8217;s comment that, sort of, every COVID death at this point is preventable, at a &#8212; you know, is the White House going to phase out its promotional campaign to drive people to vaccinate &#8212; vaccinations if at this point, you know, you&#8217;re throwing a lot of, you know &#8212; million &#8212; you know, the chance of winning the lottery at folks, and they&#8217;re still not getting vaccinated.&nbsp; Is that all going to go away and &#8212; if this is obviously people&#8217;s personal choices?<br><br>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Zeke, this is &#8212; this intensity that you&#8217;ve witnessed across the last five months is going to continue for the foreseeable future until all Americans can get vaccinated.&nbsp;<br><br>So we will continue to meet people where they are &#8212; mobile clinics, doctors&#8217; offices, pharmacies.&nbsp; They&#8217;ll continue to make it even easier and more convenient for people to get vaccinated.&nbsp;<br><br>People have questions about the vaccines, and we want to make sure that we&#8217;re ask- &#8212; answering those questions, addressing those questions at the local level &#8212; through doctors, through faith leaders, through trusted messengers at the local level.&nbsp;<br><br>So we&#8217;re not &#8212; we&#8217;re not slowing down at all.&nbsp; If anything, we&#8217;re speeding up, as Dr. Fauci has talked about, until we crush this disease.&nbsp; And we&#8217;ll continue to do everything we can to get as many Americans vaccinated as possible.&nbsp;<br><br>Dr. Murthy, anything to add there?<br><br>SURGEON GENERAL MURTHY:&nbsp; I think that&#8217;s exactly right, Jeff.&nbsp; And, Zeke, our approach and what we&#8217;ve learned over these past, you know, many months is that we have to go more and more and more local as this vaccination effort proceeds.&nbsp; It is through the one-on-one conversations, it&#8217;s through making access even easier and readily available to people that we&#8217;re going to reach more folks.&nbsp;<br><br>And we&#8217;ll continue to support states and local counties and city health officials in their effort to get people vaccinated.&nbsp; We&#8217;re not going to let up.&nbsp; I know July 4th has been an important deadline, but this continues long after July 4th.&nbsp; We&#8217;re not going anywhere.&nbsp; That&#8217;s for sure. &nbsp;<br><br>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Well, thank you, everybody.&nbsp; Thank you for joining the briefing, and we&#8217;ll look forward to seeing you at the next one.&nbsp; Thank you.<br><br>1:11 P.M. EDT</p>

<p>When we cast a ballot, we not only decide our leaders. We determine our future.<br><br>The right to vote is fundamental. It gives Americans a voice in what happens in our nation—whether that is in our economy or our national security, our education system or our healthcare system. When more people have a voice, our democracy becomes more representative, and our nation becomes stronger.<br><br>Today, across our nation, we are witnessing unprecedented attacks on voting rights. There are unjust bills in dozens of state legislatures that would limit early voting and vote by mail and otherwise make it harder for the American people to vote. Make no mistake: While these attacks are meant to silence some Americans, the impact is felt by all Americans.<br><br>At this critical moment, the United States Senate had a critical opportunity to make voting more accessible nationwide. The For The People Act has the broad support of the American people. Yet, as Senate Democrats united around the legislation, this afternoon, Senate Republicans voted against advancing it.<br><br>The President and I are undeterred, and I know the American people are as well. Like generations before, we will not give up, we will not give in, and we will continue the fight to strengthen the right to vote. We will fortify and expand the nationwide coalition on voting rights, and promote voter engagement and registration nationwide. We will lift up leaders in the states who are working to stop anti-voter legislation, and work with leaders in Congress to advance federal legislation that will strengthen voting rights.<br><br>I want to be clear that our Administration remains determined to work with Congress to pass the For The People Act, and we will keep working with Congress to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act.<br><br>Here is the bottom line: Our democracy is stronger when everyone participates—and it is weaker when people are denied meaningful access to participation. And that is why the right to vote is neither Democratic nor Republican. The right to vote is an American right.<br><br>It is our duty, at every opportunity, to protect and strengthen the right to vote.</p>
