										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>Four years ago today in Charlottesville, Virginia the battle for the soul of America was laid bare for all to see.<br> <br>The forces of hate and violence were summoned from the shadows as Neo-Nazis, Klansmen, and white supremacists descended on a historic American city. With torches in their hands and veins bulging from their necks, they spewed the same antisemitic bile that was heard in Germany in the 1930s and with the same beatings and bigotry we saw in Jim Crow America for nearly a century.<br> <br>But what they didn’t account for was the extraordinary force of American goodness and decency. In that moment and as we’ve seen throughout our history, Americans of different races, religions, and backgrounds stood ground and stayed true to the promise of our nation: that we are all created equal and deserve to be treated equally throughout our lives.  <br> In that moment, the courage of the nation was summoned. One brave woman, Heather Heyer, a young civil rights activist, was murdered while representing the best of us. Her life and activism are reminders that while we have never fully lived up to the promise of America, we have never fully walked away from it either.<br> <br>What happened in Charlottesville – and securing the promise of America for every American – motivated me to run for president and now motivates my Administration’s work to ensure that hate has no safe harbor in America.<br> <br>In my first week in office, I signed an executive order establishing whole-of-government effort to advance racial equity and support underserved communities, and a presidential memorandum directing all federal agencies to combat the resurgence of xenophobia against Asian Americans that we’ve seen during this pandemic.<br> <br>And in May, I signed into law the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act that empowers the U.S. Department of Justice and our entire Administration to address the critical problem of hate crimes being underreported. The law includes provisions in Heather Heyer’s name that will help state and local governments to ensure hate crimes information is more accessible to the public.<br> <br>Heather’s mother joined me at the bill signing. As I told her on that day, I know it’s hard. Even with the significance of the law being changed, it’s like getting the news of her death just seconds ago.  It takes enormous courage. It’s also especially hard on this day of commemoration. Jill and I are thinking about Heather and her family.<br> <br>And we know there is more work we must do as a nation – as we saw with the mob of insurrectionists at the United States Capitol on January 6<sup>th </sup>that joins the horror we saw in Charlottesville as shameful chapters in our history.<br> <br>We must acknowledge what America’s intelligence community has already confirmed, and what Charlottesville and so many other communities know all too well: the most lethal terrorist threat to our homeland in recent years has been domestic terrorism rooted in white supremacy.  We cannot ignore it.  We must confront the spread of hate-fueled violence in every form.<br> <br>To that end, in June, my Administration laid out America’s first-ever comprehensive effort to take on the threat of domestic terrorism.  We are doing so by countering and reducing online radicalization and recruitment to violence, disrupting the networks that inspire violence by domestic terrorists and hate groups, and providing new resources for communities to build up local resilience against the spread of hate.<br> <br>Charlottesville is an example of how this is the work of all of us.<br> <br>In the hours and days after what happened there, America’s moral conscience stirred. The nation’s military, business, and labor leaders took a firm stand. Political, community, and faith leaders raised their voices. Religious leaders held a prayer service at St. Paul’s Memorial Episcopal Church the night before the rally and marched in the streets the next day. When the Neo-Nazi marchers passed Charlottesville’s only synagogue, Beth Israel, the congregation continued worship services, stood up to the hate, and helped their neighbors. And we should never forget the courage of that small group of University of Virginia students who stared down the mob and did not flinch.<br> <br>While it may come with enormous pain and cost, the greatness of America is that at our best, we meet President Lincoln’s appeal to embrace the “better angels of our nature.”<br> <br>That’s what we must do – together – to win this battle for the soul of America.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Via Teleconference<br>South Court Auditorium</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">(August 11, 2021)</p>



<p>3:13 P.M. EDT</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Hello, folks.&nbsp; Sorry I&#8217;m a few minutes late.&nbsp; It&#8217;s good to see you all.&nbsp; Gretchen, how are you?&nbsp;</p>



<p>I understand we have another 95,000 people on this Zoom, but apparently there&#8217;s a large number of folks on.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m going to begin by thanking you all &#8212; all those of you I can&#8217;t see as well &#8212; for signing on to help pass the infrastructure bill.&nbsp; It mattered a lot.&nbsp; It&#8217;s the first big bipartisan thing we&#8217;ve done in a long while, and I think it&#8217;s long overdue.&nbsp; And it is great to see you all.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yesterday, the Senate passed the bipartisan infrastructure bill, in no small part because of all of you, in a significant milestone in the road toward making what we all know are long-overdue and much-needed investments.</p>



<p>As Gretchen, when she ran, said, &#8220;Just fix the roads, damn it.&#8221;&nbsp; Right?&nbsp; Well, we&#8217;re going to do more than that this time around.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I want to thank you for the work and for all of you &#8212; and my administration, with the members of Congress, with the media &#8212; to highlight the need to make these investments in our nation&#8217;s infrastructure.</p>



<p>As mayors, governors, Tribal and county leaders, state and local officials at every level, you know that there&#8217;s no such thing as a Democratic road or a Republican bridge.&nbsp; But you do know what&#8217;s not working, and you know what it means to be accountable to the people you serve and to focus on solving real problems people are facing in your communities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But you also know that often states and cities and counties can&#8217;t do it alone.&nbsp; They need the federal government to be a partner, solving problems.&nbsp; And being a partner is what we&#8217;re supposed to be doing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That&#8217;s the approach we&#8217;ve been taking with this bipartisan infrastructure bill.&nbsp; It&#8217;s going to create literally millions of jobs &#8212; good-paying jobs, putting America on a path to win the 21st century global economy.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re in a competition with many other nations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And it makes key investments to put people to work in cities, small towns, and rural communities.&nbsp; I believe it&#8217;s a historic investment in roads and rail, in transit and bridges, in clean energy and clean water.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s going to enable us not only to build back, but to build back better than ever before.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Across America, more than 45,000 bridges are structurally deficient.&nbsp; Let me say that again: 45,000 bridges in America are structurally deficient.&nbsp; One out of every five miles of highway is in disrepair.&nbsp; And this bill makes the largest investment in bridges since the creation of the Interstate Highway System.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You know, 10 million households, and 400,000 schools, daycare centers &#8212; they lack safe drinking water.&nbsp; This bill is going to allow us to replace 100 percent of the nation&#8217;s lead pipes and service lines so every child in America can turn on a faucet in their school or at home and drink clean water.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That&#8217;s what this infrastructure is all about today.&nbsp; We&#8217;re going to need to build the infrastructure for tomorrow, not just today.&nbsp; We got to build back not just &#8212; I know you&#8217;re tired of hearing me say it, but build back better that it was before we hit this God-awful circumstance we found ourselves in.</p>



<p>This bill is going to deliver high-speed Internet to every American.&nbsp; And we&#8217;ll build a national network of 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And here is another important part of the bill: Nearly 90 percent of the jobs created by this bill don&#8217;t require a college degree.&nbsp; This is the ultimate blue-collar blueprint to rebuild America.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And we&#8217;re going to do it without raising taxes by one cent on anyone making less than $400,000 a year.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why we wouldn&#8217;t even support a gas &#8212; increased gas tax.</p>



<p>As we did with the Transcontinental Railroad and the Interstate Highway System, we&#8217;re going to once again transform America and propel this nation into the future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Look, I believe that passing this bill will also do something else: It will help ease the years of gridlock in Washington and show the American people that their government can and will work for them again.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We&#8217;re going to still have big disagreements, but it&#8217;s happening at a critical time, because now is the moment to build our &#8212; on our momentum.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Folks, we&#8217;ve added more than 4 million new jobs since my first day in office six months ago.&nbsp; The unemployment rate is the lowest since the pandemic hit.&nbsp; We&#8217;re delivering a tax cut to families with children every single month.&nbsp; And those who get their health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, we&#8217;re covering more people, and we&#8217;re able to do it at lower premiums by up to 40 percent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And it’s a battle with Delta virus.&nbsp; We have &#8212; we have the tools.&nbsp; We have the vaccinations.&nbsp; We have &#8212; we need to vaccinate more Americans and the tools to keep our economy growing and growing.&nbsp; But we got to get more people vaccinated.&nbsp; I know you all know that well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We just have to act.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s what I want to talk about today.&nbsp; I want to hear from you about these investments: what they&#8217;re going to mean for your states and communities; what we could have done better, if there&#8217;s things we could have done; and why it is so urgent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so let me start with Governor Whitmer.&nbsp; We all remember your campaign slogan, Gov &#8212;</p>



<p>GOVERNOR WHITMER:&nbsp; (Laughs.)</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; &#8212; that &#8212; you’ve been focused on trying to fix the roads in your state since you took office.&nbsp; And what &#8212; what &#8212; what will this federal investments in Michigan roads and bridges do and mean to your state&#8217;s economy and job creation?&nbsp;</p>



<p>So &#8212; and then I want to hear from the rest of you.&nbsp; But I&#8217;ll go one at a time, if that&#8217;s okay.&nbsp;</p>



<p>GOVERNOR WHITMER:&nbsp; Sounds perfect.</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Gretchen, fire away.&nbsp;</p>



<p>GOVERNOR WHITMER:&nbsp; All right.&nbsp; Thanks, Mr. President.&nbsp; I&#8217;m so glad to be here with you.&nbsp; It&#8217;s my honor to be here as the governor of the great state of Michigan as we come together to make the largest infrastructure investment in American history.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, Mr. President, you mentioned it, but I ran on fixing the damn roads.</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; I remember.&nbsp; (Laughs.)</p>



<p>GOVERNOR WHITMER:&nbsp; (Laughs.)&nbsp; And you know, and it&#8217;s fixing the dams and roads.&nbsp; You know, don&#8217;t think I haven&#8217;t noticed that so many other governors and Cabinet Secretaries have been stealing that tagline.&nbsp; But, of course, it&#8217;s because it is true across the nation, right?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anyone can use that phrase, but just make sure that the mom in Flint who first said that to me back in 2018 gets a little bit of credit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You know, today, I&#8217;m especially proud to have so many partners in Washington who share our mission to fix the damn roads.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I want to thank you, Mr. President, and Vice President Harris for making infrastructure a real priority.&nbsp; And because of your leadership and dedication, countless families, communities, and small businesses in Michigan and across the country are going to benefit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I also want to thank all the senators who worked across the aisle to get this done &#8212; including Michigan&#8217;s own Senator Debbie Stabenow and Senator Gary Peters, who&#8217;ve been tireless champions for Michiganders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I&#8217;m so glad to be here speaking alongside Mayor Dyer and Mayor Lumumba, Commissioner Hausmann, and Chief Hoskin.&nbsp; This diverse group shows just how wide-ranging an impact that this bill is going to have.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act takes a big step toward helping Michigan modernize and develop the infrastructure we need to effectively connect our communities and continue our economic jumpstart.</p>



<p>The bold package is going to create millions of good-paying jobs; fix our crumbling roads and bridges; help us build a clean, resilient energy grid; bolster public transportation; deliver clean drinking water to millions of families; and ensure every home has access to high-speed Internet, which we know &#8212; after the last year and a half &#8212; is just truly a foundational and fundamental need.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This landmark bill is going to be a game changer for us here in Michigan.&nbsp; We&#8217;re estimated to receive $7.26 billion for roads and bridges here.&nbsp; That $7.26 billion we can use to restore and rebuild our crumbling roads and bridges, saving drivers and small businesses money and time.&nbsp; That&#8217;s $7.26 billion to make commutes or the drive to school, road trips up north, safer and smoother.</p>



<p>The bill will also build out a national network of electric vehicle charging stations, helping Michigan&#8217;s iconic auto industry turbocharge its transition to electric and continue leading the future of mobility.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, that F150 that you drove in Dearborn, Mr. President, or I know that the GM truck you drove the other day, that&#8217;s how &#8212; we need to have this infrastructure so that we can lead the world in advanced mobility.</p>



<p>So, this is a much-needed investment in moving us towards an electric future, and it may be the momentum we need for bigger investments in the future.</p>



<p>Our Senators Stabenow and Peters spearheaded a record&nbsp; $1 billion investment in the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative.</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>GOVERNOR WHITMER:&nbsp; It&#8217;ll help us clean up and restore the beautiful freshwater lakes and preserve our picturesque peninsulas.</p>



<p>And finally, the package includes $10 billion to help us continue cleaning up toxic chemicals and contaminants from our water supply.&nbsp; It includes $4 billion to help water utilities remove chemicals from their supply or to connect well owners to local systems, and another $5 billion to help small or disadvantaged communities tackle PFAS in drinking water.</p>



<p>So, I think this is the &#8212; setting the stage for future collaboration as well &#8212; as well as this bill heads to the House and awaits final passage.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re going to keep working at the state level to make bold infrastructure investments as well.&nbsp; I got a $3.5 billion build &#8212; Rebuilding Michigan road bonding plan done the year before last.&nbsp; Twenty-one state highway construction projects are underway this summer, supporting 22,800 good-paying jobs.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re investing resources to make sure every Michigander can go about their day and get things done without worrying if they&#8217;re going to blow a tire or crack an axle.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re doing it while creating all these jobs in the process.</p>



<p>So, the economic and job-creating potential of this Infrastructure and Jobs Act is huge.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a big deal, as you would say.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>With this once-in-a-generation investment, we can usher in a new era of prosperity and build back better from this pandemic stronger than ever.</p>



<p>So, I&#8217;m grateful for your leadership, Mr. President.&nbsp; I&#8217;m excited about the prospect of this and what it&#8217;s going to mean for every American &#8212; and not some, not a few, but every one of us will benefit when we get this done.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I&#8217;m so glad to be with you today.</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Well, thank you.&nbsp; And, by the way, you know, I think, sort of breaking through this first big barrier in a bipartisan way, I really believe &#8212; it doesn&#8217;t make everything easy, but it does have a way &#8212; it has an effect on other things.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I noticed that you mentioned having &#8212; I had the three presidents of the three major American automobile companies, the UAW, and all of the &#8212; all the auto workers in my backyard here at the White House with their electric vehicles.&nbsp; The commitment is to get 40 &#8212; I believe, 50 percent of all our vehicles in America be electric vehicles, with 550,000 charging stations along the highways that are being repaired and &#8212; you know, or built.</p>



<p>And, you know, that means, for Michigan, if I&#8217;m looking at my notes here, you&#8217;re going to receive $110 million dollars for the expansion of EV &#8212; of EV charging networks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, I just think, hopefully, this makes people realize if the autoworkers and the automobile executives can get together and form this kind of alliance, I think we&#8217;re making some real progress.</p>



<p>But, thank you, Jennifer [Gretchen], for what you&#8217;ve done and continue to do.</p>



<p>And, Mr. Mayor &#8212; Jerry, I don&#8217;t want to get you in trouble out in Fresno, California, for letting you know I actually like a Republican.&nbsp; But you&#8217;ve done a hell of a job.&nbsp; I&#8217;m anxious to hear about your electric buses later.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But, anyway, the floor is yours, Jerry.</p>



<p>MAYOR DYER:&nbsp; Thank you, Mr. President, for your leadership on this critical infrastructure package.&nbsp; You know, there &#8212; there are really many things to like about this infrastructure bill, beginning with bipartisan support.&nbsp; That always makes it easier on us at the local level, as you mentioned.</p>



<p>And the last time I checked, both Republican and Democrats alike travel on our roadways and cross our bridges, use mass transit, and breathe the same air.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, unfortunately, Fresno, along with Los Angeles, our neighbors to the south, had some of the worst air quality in the nation &#8212;</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Yep.</p>



<p>MAYOR DYER:&nbsp; &#8212; which is why we&#8217;re focused on transitioning to clean air buses in Fresno, as you mentioned.&nbsp; In fact, we rolled out our first two electric buses last week &#8212;</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; I know.</p>



<p>MAYOR DYER:&nbsp; &#8212; thanks to a Federal Transportation Administration grant.&nbsp; Thank you, Mr. President, to your administration.&nbsp; And this bi- &#8212; this bill, I believe, will accelerate those efforts here in Fresno.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Second, as you know, Fresno is ground zero to &#8212; for California&#8217;s high-speed rail efforts.</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Yep.</p>



<p>MAYOR DYER:&nbsp; And I&#8217;m proud to say that Fresno will be host to the &#8212; the nation&#8217;s first high-speed rail station right here in downtown Fresno.&nbsp; And so federal assistance is vital in order to complete this project.&nbsp; And I&#8217;m hopeful that this infrastructure bill will provide that financial support to us here in Fresno.</p>



<p>And Fresno, like many cities, is in the midst of airport expansion with the addition of a new terminal at our Fresno Yosemite International Airport this coming year.&nbsp; And certainly, this bill has the potential to expedite our airport expansion as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And with the changing climate and drought conditions in California, we are facing, on a weekly basis, life-threatening wildfires that not only put our power grid in danger locally, but our firefighters as well.&nbsp; And this bill will strengthen our power grid by investing in it, which is vital in our region.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s very important that we do so in order to avoid some of the rolling blackouts that we experience here in Fresno as a matter of routine.</p>



<p>And lastly, unfortunately &#8212; and I&#8217;m not proud of this &#8212; but Fresno is number two in poverty in the state of California.&nbsp; We have a very poor valley, a very poor region.&nbsp; Most of our jobs historically have been agricultural-centric, although that is changing.&nbsp; And this infrastructure bill will create good-paying, meaningful jobs, which are desperately needed in Fresno and throughout our region, and allow us to build upon those agricultural jobs that we&#8217;ve been relying upon.</p>



<p>So I just want to say, on &#8212; as the mayor of Fresno and as a Republican, I am very grateful for your leadership, Mr. President on this infrastructure package &#8212; making it a priority with your administration; considering &#8212; or taking into consideration input from state and local jurisdictions; as well as working diligently to pursue that bipartisan support.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, thank you again, and we are here to assist and take advantage of that funding.</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Well, Jerry &#8212; thank you, Mr. Mayor.&nbsp; Look, I&#8217;m not being solicitous, but we kind of had Fresno in mind &#8212; I&#8217;m not joking &#8212; because the air quality, the &#8212; where you sit, how tough it is for you there.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, you know, all the things you mentioned have an impact &#8212; are going to allow you to have an impact on air quality.</p>



<p>You know me, because you&#8217;re aware of it, I&#8217;m a big rail guy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MAYOR DYER:&nbsp; Yes.</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; We have more money in this &#8212; in this area for high-speed rail than all the money we spend on set &#8212; setting up Amtrak.&nbsp; This is a gigantic investment.&nbsp; And you know as well as I do, when people can take a train from point A to point B &#8212; conveniently and faster than you can drive your vehicle &#8212; they take the train.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We&#8217;re talking about electric.&nbsp; We&#8217;re talking about electric.&nbsp; We&#8217;re not talking diesels.&nbsp; We&#8217;re talking about electric.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re talking about being able to transform and impact on the air quality in your area, because of geographic location and the spot you&#8217;re in.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Also, with regard to the power grid: You know, you have seen more than most people &#8212; in California, you&#8217;ve seen the impact that weather has on not being able to sustain the security of the power grid &#8212;&nbsp;</p>



<p>MAYOR DYER:&nbsp; Right.</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; &#8212; whether it was bad weather or fires or whatever it is.&nbsp; And there&#8217;s a lot of money in here &#8212; a lot of money in here for making sure we can take care of the lines that carry the electricity, the lines that move it along.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And one of the other pieces in here that I know you know about because you&#8217;re already doing it, is that &#8212; you know, your airport &#8212; your airport, as well as the high-speed rail terminal.&nbsp; That also &#8212; there&#8217;s money in here for airports.&nbsp; Republicans strongly supported it, as well as Democrats, because there&#8217;s a lot that has to be done to modernize the airports.&nbsp; And that also has the impact of cutting down on air quality problems and the like.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so, there&#8217;s so much.&nbsp; And I understand you have seven more electric buses on order or you&#8217;re thinking about getting another seven.&nbsp; We got some money for you.</p>



<p>MAYOR DYER:&nbsp; Yeah, we have &#8212;</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; We got some money for you.</p>



<p>MAYOR DYER:&nbsp; (Laughs.)&nbsp; Well, thank you, Mr. President.&nbsp; We actually have seven more that are going to be coming on line in 2022.&nbsp; So &#8212; and if you want to send us more, we&#8217;ll take them.</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Well, by the way, it is really a big, big deal.&nbsp; And one of the things we&#8217;re doing is we have provisions that we&#8217;re trying to encourage the American manufacturers to actually generate and build the platforms for these electric buses.</p>



<p>I was in Carolina looking at a factory where they&#8217;re making not only school buses, but also, you know, the regular transit systems that are electric-based.&nbsp; It&#8217;s phenomenal what&#8217;s going on, but we have to make sure we have all the par- &#8212; you know, access to &#8212; to the various pieces of materials and minerals we need to produce them.&nbsp; But it&#8217;s a big deal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, I&#8217;m going to be coming back to you, and all of you, to get help on making sure we continue to make these investments because I view this as just starting, not the end.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But this is going to &#8212; this is going to play out over the next eight years &#8212; these investments.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a lot of money.&nbsp; It&#8217;s over $500 million &#8212; billion in new money over those eight years.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s paid for.&nbsp; It&#8217;s paid for.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, thanks for what you&#8217;re doing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, you know, I always joke with my friends: You know, being a mayor maybe is the toughest job in American politics; they know where you live &#8212; (laughs) &#8212; and you affect their everyday lives more than anybody.&nbsp; So, I wish you the best of luck.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MAYOR DYER:&nbsp; Thank you, Mr. President.</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Mayor Lumumba, from Jackson, Mississippi.&nbsp; How you doing, pal?&nbsp; Good to see you again.&nbsp; Thanks for being so nice to my wife.</p>



<p>MAYOR LUMUMBA:&nbsp; (Laughs.)&nbsp; Thank you, Mr. President.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a pleasure to join you.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a pleasure to join all of the amazing people on this call today.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I want to express my gratitude not only to your administration, but towards the bipartisan effort that has led to this bill passing the Senate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I want to thank Roger &#8212; Senator Roger Wicker &#8212;</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Yep.</p>



<p>MAYOR LUMUMBA:&nbsp; &#8212; from Mississippi &#8212;</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; He stepped up.</p>



<p>MAYOR LUMUMBA:&nbsp; &#8212; who stepped up and supported this effort.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mr. President, as you are well aware, the residents of Jackson, who I have the honor to serve, are greater than the sum of their challenges.&nbsp; And the city of Jackson is greater than the sum of its challenges, with amazing people and with a city which is pregnant with possibilities.&nbsp; But we do have real challenges, which were reflected in our February storms &#8212; the consecutive storms that we faced that completely debilitated our water distribution system.&nbsp; These are challenges we have seen frequently and were reflected in a different fashion most recently in February.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because we have experienced hotter &#8212; hotter summers, colder winters, and more rain in the rainy season, it has had a detrimental impact on our aging and crumbling infrastructure.&nbsp; What it resulted in, in February, was literally raw water screens that froze, making it difficult for water to get into our water treatment facility, consequently making it difficult for treated water to get out.&nbsp; This led to thousands &#8212; tens of thousands of residents across the city of Jackson being without potable and non-potable water.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is more than just a matter of convenience.&nbsp; It is a matter of life and what people rely on.&nbsp; It&#8217;s how people take their medication.&nbsp; It&#8217;s how people, in the midst of a pandemic &#8212; pandemic, take care of their sanitary needs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so, this has been an extreme challenge.&nbsp; And I can&#8217;t express enough my gratitude for your efforts and the bipartisan effort to see to this bill passing the Senate.&nbsp; And we look forward to its passage through the House.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I believe that one of our <a>principal functions</a>, as leaders who are responsible for the needs of our residents, is understanding that budgets are moral documents which should reflect the values we have as a nation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We need our budgets and we need our economy to more than just reflect our aspirations of GDP and stock market metrics.&nbsp; They must meet <a>sustainable development goals, a</a>nd we must create a dignity economy &#8212; an economy which reflects the inherent dignity of every person.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To be able to provide safe drinking water, a sustainable infrastructure, a resilient infrastructure, and. might I add, an equitable infrastructure has to be a part of our plan to build back better.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so, I want to, once again, express my gratitude for your hard work, your focus on this issue.&nbsp; When I met you during your campaign in Atlanta, Georgia, you stated that this would be a focus of yours, and I&#8217;m thankful for you holding true to that promise.</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Well, Mr. Mayor, thank you.&nbsp; You know, I think it&#8217;s important that the other sixteen- or seventeen hundred people who are on this call understand what you and others have gone through.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You &#8212; you found yourself in a position, in terms of water, where &#8212; it&#8217;s estimated by our team that over the next 20 years, Mississippi drinking water infrastructure &#8212; Mississippi drinking water infrastructure is going to require $4.8 billion in additional funding.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act includes $55 billion in investment to ensure clean, safe drinking water.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s a right of all communities, as you point out.</p>



<p>And the bill would eliminate the nation&#8217;s lead-based service lines, which I know you and I talked about.&nbsp; And so, there&#8217;s a lot of good that&#8217;s going on in here.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I say to Mayor Dryer [Dyer] as well that &#8212; we talk about, you know, the poverty rate of these towns &#8212; you know, we&#8217;re going to be able to fab [sic] &#8212; all of you have full-blown Internet that&#8217;s affordable and available in rural and cities across the way that&#8217;s going to change the circumstance for people in those communities that &#8212; particularly, those folks &#8212; so people don&#8217;t have to &#8212; when they&#8217;re &#8212; if, God forbid, we&#8217;re back to having, you know, distanced learning, where they don&#8217;t have to sit in the McDonald&#8217;s parking lot to get access &#8212; with their mom or dad &#8212; to get access to the Internet to do their work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, I just can&#8217;t thank you enough.&nbsp; You’ve &#8212; you’ve really gone out of the way to deal with the issues that we&#8217;re talking about here.&nbsp; And I think &#8212; I hope you&#8217;re going to see a lot of benefit flow from this.&nbsp; Because the idea, you know, no more Flints, no more Jacksons, in terms of water, because we’re going to get this done with &#8212; as my grandfather used to say, “with the grace of God and the goodwill of the neighbors.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>But we got, also, the entire United States Senate supporting it by 69 votes.&nbsp; And we’re looking forward to it happening in the House as well.&nbsp; So, thanks a lot, pal. &nbsp;And let us know what you need in this if you’re &#8212; if &#8212; any of you, if you, you know &#8212; if any of it comes across as confusing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, I know Liz Hausmann of Fulton County &#8212; County Commissioner &#8212; isn’t going to be confused about anything.&nbsp; But, I &#8212; you know, I &#8212; Liz, I made a mistake saying that being a mayor is the toughest; maybe being a county commissioner is.&nbsp; You know why?&nbsp; Because you knock on a door and say, “My name is Joe Biden, candidate for the county council.”&nbsp; And they’ll look at you and smile and say, “Yeah.”&nbsp; And you know what they’re thinking &#8212; “What do you do?&nbsp; What does a commissioner do?”&nbsp; (Laughs.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anyway, you have a hell of a job, Liz, and so why don’t you tell me what you &#8212; what’s on your mind.&nbsp; And I know you take &#8212; do you take in a lot of Atlanta in your district?</p>



<p>COMMISSIONER HAUSMANN:&nbsp; Atlanta is in our county.&nbsp; Yes, sir.&nbsp;</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp;</p>



<p>COMMISSIONER HAUSMANN:&nbsp; We have 15 cities, including Atlanta.&nbsp;</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; Well, fire away.&nbsp; The floor is yours.</p>



<p>COMMISSIONER HAUSMANN:&nbsp; Well, Mr. President, first of all, it&#8217;s an honor to serve the citizens of Fulton County, but it&#8217;s a true honor to be here with you today as we have this important conversation about the future and improving our nation&#8217;s infrastructure.&nbsp; So, thank you for having me.</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Thank you.<br><br>COMMISSIONER HAUSMANN:&nbsp; I’m coming from the state of Georgia, which provides &#8212; which prides itself in being the number-one state in the nation to do business.&nbsp; Along with that, of course, comes heavy traffic and congestion.</p>



<p>For counties across the country, generally, this is an important conversation, as we are tasked with directly supporting 78 percent of the public transit systems across the United States.&nbsp; So, this $39 billion in new investments is greatly appreciated and will be very impactful to the services that we provide in the public transit arena.</p>



<p>Counties invest over $23 billion each year in the operation, maintenance, and construction of transit utilities and mass transit systems, including subways, surface rails, and buses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That&#8217;s all to say that counties play a critical role in the nation&#8217;s transportation and infrastructure network, and we appreciate all the work that has gone into the creation of the bipartisan infrastructure investment and Jobs Act.</p>



<p>Here in Fulton County and the 13-county metro Atlanta region, we have done extensive planning for expanding our transit system, including site visits with our county and city leaders to transit assets of other major metropolitan areas.&nbsp; And our state has legislatively created a regional authority to coordinate efforts with existing transit agencies across our region.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unfortunately, we do not have the resources necessary to implement those plans.&nbsp; So, we&#8217;re especially pleased to see the increase in the Small Starts program project eligibility from $300- to $400 million, along with the increase of $50 million in the federal match.</p>



<p>For Fulton County and Metro Atlanta, this means that many of our transit expansion projects will now be eligible to receive this expanded federal funding.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The bottom line is that this bipartisan infrastructure package provides mobility options for our community, and the transit provisions provide connectivity, jobs, and sustainability for the growth that we know is coming.&nbsp; In Metro Atlanta alone, we expect to grow by 2 million people in the next 20 years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, we&#8217;ve long suffered with local governments being the &#8212; required to fund what really is a regional problem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>COMMISSIONER HAUSMANN:&nbsp; The reality is each county is limited to funding projects within our county borders.&nbsp; And our authority may stop at the county border, but our transportation needs do not.&nbsp;</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Absolutely.</p>



<p>COMMISSIONER HAUSMANN:&nbsp; So, we can&#8217;t do it without the support and partnership of our state and federal government.&nbsp; And this bipartisan infrastructure package will help us do just that.&nbsp; So, thank you very much.</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Well, thank you.&nbsp; Look, what usually is &#8212; I know all of you understand this &#8212; and the other over a thousand&nbsp; people on this call understand &#8212; local officials &#8212; is that when you talk about the commute times and public transportation,&nbsp;you know, the &#8212; in Georgia, public transportation spends an extra &#8212; those on public transportation spend an extra 74.1 percent of their time commuting.&nbsp; And non-white hol- &#8212; [non-]white households are 3.9 times more likely to commute on public transportation.</p>



<p>Seven percent of the trains and other transit vehicles in the state are past their useful life.&nbsp; And based on the formula funding alone, Georgia would expect to get $1.4 billion over the next five years &#8212; a significant portion of which would be in your county &#8212; under the infrastructure investment and Jobs Act to improve public transportation across the state.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When you spend that much time commuting &#8212; all of you know this &#8212; it costs taxpayers &#8212; it cost those commuters a lot of money.&nbsp; For example, the average &#8212; the average Georgia driver, on average, spends $375 a year in costs due to driving on roads that need to be repaired.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You have a circumstance in your state where 374 bridges and over two thousand six &#8212; 260 miles of highway are in poor condition.&nbsp; So, it all comes down to being able to move and move without creating additional pollution, and generating the ability to move safely and do it in a way that will significantly increase business opportunities and the like.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, I &#8212; having been a county official myself, I know that it&#8217;s &#8212; it&#8217;s hard to convince people that, because you overlap cities and towns and the like, that, you know, it all affects you; you don&#8217;t have it all.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, thank you for your support.&nbsp; And I think it&#8217;s going to be very helpful, I hope.</p>



<p>COMMISSIONER HAUSMANN:&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; I’m glad to hear you’ve got Georgia on your mind, Mr. President.</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Oh, I do, for more &#8212; for more than one reason.&nbsp; (Laughs.)</p>



<p>Look, I finally want to turn to Principal Chief Chuck Hoskin, Cherokee Nation in Oklahoma.&nbsp; Principal Chief Hoskin, your administration has invested millions of dollars to bring high-speed Internet to Cherokee Nation, especially rural Cherokee communities.&nbsp; How will the additional Tribal broadband resources support your Tribal citizens?&nbsp; Or whatever else you want to talk about.&nbsp; But it seems to me that ought to be &#8212; that &#8212; that should be of significant help to you, I hope.</p>



<p>PRINCIPAL CHIEF HOSKIN:&nbsp; It is.&nbsp; Thank you, Mr. President.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a great honor to be with you and with all the leaders on this panel.</p>



<p>This bill is important for the country.&nbsp; But I want you to know that the bill is important to me because you didn&#8217;t forget Indian Country.&nbsp; This bill, overall, has more than $11 billion in investment in Indian Country.&nbsp; That is historic &#8212; potentially transformational investment for Tribes across this country.&nbsp; That’s very important.</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Indian nations.&nbsp; Indian nations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>PRINCIPAL CHIEF HOSKIN:&nbsp; Indian Nations across this country, working as sovereigns &#8212; as sovereigns with the United States.</p>



<p>For us, broadband is a high priority.&nbsp; You know, no Cherokee kid ought to be going to school without access to high-speed Internet.&nbsp; No elder ought to lack access to the kind of telemedicine that we&#8217;re making available to our people because they live in an area without connectivity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The entrepreneurs that we know are out there in some of our little communities and our bigger communities &#8212; they shouldn&#8217;t miss opportunities to develop because they live in an area where they can&#8217;t connect with the rest of the world.&nbsp; Cherokee families ought to be able to connect just like anyone else.</p>



<p>And connectivity and broadband is important for the country.&nbsp; In Indian Country, the problem is particularly difficult in the rural parts of Indian Country, in particular.&nbsp; So, we&#8217;re dealing with that at Cherokee Nation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve already, as you indicated, have invested heavily into that cause for the reasons that I mentioned.&nbsp; But there&#8217;s another reason, which is that, if a lot of these small communities in these rural areas wither on the vine because they don&#8217;t have broadband and a chance to succeed in the new economy, that means Cherokee lifeways and culture and our language withers on the vine, and we can&#8217;t let that happen.&nbsp; So, this is an important moment for the Cherokee Nation.</p>



<p>During COVID, what we found is what we already were concerned about, which is that when you have a lack of high-speed Internet, when you have the worst public health crisis in living memory, and students are having to change the way they learn, and elders are having to be more isolated, families are having to socially distance from their fellow Cherokees &#8212; we know that it&#8217;s more important than ever to stay connected.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And what we found &#8212; we used a Department of Interior grant, and we found that 35 of our communities lacked connectivity, but we went right to work to stand up high &#8212; hotspots in those communities.&nbsp; We issued 11,000 hotspots to students and other Cherokees who needed them, just to get us through.&nbsp; That was important.&nbsp; It was a significant investment, but it really is a drop in the bucket, Mr. President, of what we need as we went out and visited with these families.</p>



<p>So, we are applying for the Tribal Broadband Connectivity grant through the United States Department of Commerce, the National Telecommunications &#8212;</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>PRINCIPAL CHIEF HOSKIN:&nbsp; &#8212; and Infrastrati- &#8212; Information Administration.&nbsp; What this bill does is it injects $2 billion &#8212; more dollars into that program.&nbsp; It extends the life of the program by four years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That&#8217;s going to let Tribes, like the Cherokee Nation, that are already working on this to grab those dollars and put them immediately to work to scale up what I&#8217;m talking about.&nbsp; So those communities where we put up hotspots will &#8212; will build out the infrastructure needed to make permanent conductivity in those communities.&nbsp; We&#8217;ll make sure that those kids and those elders stay connected.</p>



<p>And the other thing that your administration has done is its commitment to working and consulting in a meaningful manner with Tribal nations.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s why we have confidence when we work with your Department of Commerce that we can tailor these programs in a way that&#8217;s flexible, that reflects what we need in our rural communities, in our Cherokee communities.&nbsp; We have great confidence in that.&nbsp; So, it&#8217;s as much about the respect as it is about the dollars.&nbsp; But the dollars, of course, are indispensable, and they are plentiful in this bill.</p>



<p>We recently visited, Mr. President, an elderly family &#8212; some Cherokee elders that are fluent Cherokee speakers.&nbsp; They live in a little community called Bellefonte.&nbsp; They had told us that they actually didn&#8217;t go to their telemedicine appointments during COVID when we had to keep our health facilities limited in terms of access because they didn&#8217;t have connectivity.&nbsp; And we didn&#8217;t know it, so we partnered with Starlink and we have high-speed Internet to their home.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so, our Deputy Chief, Bryan Warner, and I got on a virtual conference with them.&nbsp; They said they&#8217;d only seen something like that on TV.&nbsp; They never thought they would do it.&nbsp; It&#8217;s opening up an entire world to them.</p>



<p>And what it told me, Mr. President, and what I think it tells a lot of Tribal leaders, is that we have a chance to get a foothold in the economy for our people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But this is very important: Those are fluent Cherokee speakers.&nbsp; If we don&#8217;t succeed right now in connecting elders to kids, connecting schools, connecting healthcare, we will lose something that&#8217;s irreplaceable.&nbsp; It&#8217;s more irreplaceable than the economic development that we know this bill will generate.&nbsp; It&#8217;s more important than anything, and that is Cherokee language and culture.</p>



<p>When we look back, Mr. President, generations from now, and know that we saved it, know that Cherokee language is thriving and that our economy is doing good and that our reservation is a place where there&#8217;s prosperity &#8212; we&#8217;re going to look back at this moment, and we&#8217;re going to see that we had this opportunity to make transformational change.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We couldn&#8217;t have done it without our federal partners.&nbsp; We&#8217;re certainly proud of our leadership.&nbsp; We couldn&#8217;t do it without this bill, I&#8217;m confident.</p>



<p>And you have my great appreciation and admiration for that.</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Well, you have my appreciation.&nbsp; You don&#8217;t owe me anything or nothing to appreciate.&nbsp; This is &#8212; this is what we used to do when I first got to the Senate.&nbsp; You know, we actually worked with one another.</p>



<p>And look, one of the things that affects Tribal lands, in my &#8212; in my experience &#8212; not just Cherokee, but across the board &#8212; is that they&#8217;re significantly at risk for the effects of climate change.&nbsp; And infrastructure investments that we&#8217;re talking about here is going to invest in &#8212; in everything from forest management, to helping communities build resilience, to wildfires and floods, and everything from elevating buildings to roads to bridges.&nbsp; Because we have to &#8212; we have to build back to where we know the minimum requirements are now, and we got to do it better.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can&#8217;t build back to what it used to be.&nbsp; You used to be able to build back a road to what it was before it got flooded out, before &#8212; you can&#8217;t do that anymore because the climate has changed so significantly already, and so you have to elevate.&nbsp; You have to move.</p>



<p>You see what&#8217;s happening on &#8212; at least in the East Coast, from Florida up to where I live in Delaware, and beyond &#8212; along the coast.&nbsp; You see the effects of the rising seas and buildings literally sinking or tilting, and losing their ability to stand.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I mean, it&#8217;s &#8212; it’s a big deal, the things that are changing.&nbsp; And so &#8212; and I think it&#8217;s particularly, you know, important in &#8212; in Tribal lands &#8212; elevating buildings, roads, bridges, winterizing the power grid, and the like.&nbsp; And so, there&#8217;s a lot to do that benefits everybody.</p>



<p>You know, one of the points I want to make &#8212; and I&#8217;ll get off my soapbox here &#8212; but, you know, my observation in my years in public life have been that when ordinary folks do well, everybody does well.&nbsp; Everybody does well.&nbsp; The wealthy do very well.&nbsp; The upper-middle class do very well.&nbsp; The middle cla- &#8212; I mean it sincerely.&nbsp; When it works from the middle out and the bottom up, everybody does well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And there&#8217;s all kinds of studies from the great universities in your states demonstrating that that is the case.&nbsp; And so, this is what this is about.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I think we have a real chance to deliver everything from clean drinking water, to access to Internets, to roads that are not congested, to dealing with the &#8212;</p>



<p>I was up in &#8212; I think it was Wisconsin, and I was talking to a group of folks in a factory.&nbsp; And &#8212; and then I spoke afterwards, and they showed me around.&nbsp; And there were about a couple hundred people.&nbsp; And in front of me, in this factory floor, were the elected officials &#8212; the governor and other folks &#8212; and to my right were all the folks &#8212; both the hourly workers and the management.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I talked about this having safety provisions in it.&nbsp; And they all looked at me like, “What the hell does that mean?”&nbsp; And I said, “I bet every one of you can name for me the intersections in your town, in your city where the highest accident rate is, where the most pedestrians are hit, where bicyclists get killed, where there is (inaudible).</p>



<p>And in unison &#8212; not a joke &#8212; if there were 120 people there, 100 of them started shaking their heads, “Yeah, we know.”&nbsp; This does a lot of practical things &#8212; a lot of practical things to change the environment that people live in.</p>



<p>So I &#8212; and there&#8217;s a lot more to do.&nbsp; I know.&nbsp; And we still have to get it through the House and get things moving.</p>



<p>But I want to thank you all for your time, your insight, and your continued leadership.&nbsp; And I want to thank you for &#8212; we&#8217;re closer than we&#8217;ve ever been a long time to making a once-in-a-generation investment.</p>



<p>You know, this total investment in roads, in highways is bigger than we did in the &#8212; Eisenhower&#8217;s, you know, Interstate Highway System.&nbsp; You know, this is &#8212; the &#8212; the only analogies out there and the vote to get it are similar.</p>



<p>Our &#8212; you know, we started off with, you know, the Erie Canal.&nbsp; We started off with moving people west.&nbsp; We started off the Intercontinental Railroad in the late 1800s.&nbsp; All &#8212; all kidding aside, we linked the coast.&nbsp; Now we came along and we did &#8212; and we had the &#8212; all the way up to Eisenhower&#8217;s Interstate Highway System.&nbsp; It has literally changed the way Americans live, changed the way we live and the way we&#8217;ve developed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And now we&#8217;re investing as much money or more money to do those kinds of things that can make us better connected and also give us more breathing room and clean the air a little bit.</p>



<p>So, I want to thank you all because almost all of you &#8212; I think all of you signed on to the bipartisan effort of mayors and &#8212; and &#8212; as well as other state and county officials to support this.</p>



<p>And I promise you, we&#8217;re going to stay on top of making sure, as long as I&#8217;m here, that it gets out, it gets out swiftly, and it gets out economically, and it gets out in a way that builds this country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I know I got criticized when I was running.&nbsp; Said &#8212; I said I was running for three reasons.&nbsp; One, to restore the soul of the country.&nbsp; Two, to rebuild the backbone &#8212; the middle-class and working-class people &#8212; of this country, and not leave them behind.&nbsp; And thirdly, to unite the country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I know a lot of people were skeptical, but we can do this.&nbsp; We can do this.&nbsp; We&#8217;re going to disagree in philosophy on some of the things, but we can do this.&nbsp; I&#8217;m convinced we can.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, by the way, I&#8217;m going to say something that has no direct bearing on &#8212; immediate bearing on what any of you are dealing with.&nbsp; But, you know, when I was over in the NATO conference; or I was over for the G7, with the largest industrial nations in the world; and when I was at a, you know, summit with Putin &#8212; and I&#8217;m about to go do the same thing, in terms of the G20 &#8212; you know what affects our &#8212; the attitude of the American &#8212; of the rest of the world about the United States?&nbsp; “Can we still do &#8212; get things done?”&nbsp; Not a joke.&nbsp; Not a joke.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When I went over, I said &#8212; with those seven leaders, I said, “We&#8217;re back.”&nbsp; And the response was, “For how long?&nbsp; For how long?&nbsp; You guys can&#8217;t get anything done.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>I&#8217;ll conclude by saying that, you know, when I won &#8212; just because of my Irish background &#8212; heritage &#8212; they were ringing bells in Ireland and painting my picture on the side of buildings and the like.&nbsp; But the Taoiseach of Ireland &#8212; the Prime Minister of Ireland &#8212; said something just before I got sworn in that made a lot of sense.&nbsp; He said, “I think I&#8217;m &#8212; I&#8217;m not sure what America can do anymore.&nbsp; They can&#8217;t even deal with COVID.&nbsp; They can&#8217;t lead anymore.”</p>



<p>That’s what the world is looking at us &#8212; they&#8217;re wondering.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And you got guys like Xi Jinping and Putin who think the answer is autocracy, because democracies can&#8217;t get together.&nbsp; The world is changing so rapidly &#8212; so rapidly.&nbsp; We can&#8217;t get together and answer the big, tough questions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I really mean it.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not joking.&nbsp; I promise you, this is what your children and grandchildren are going to be writing about in their senior thesis in graduate school.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And we got to make sure we can demonstrate we can get things done.&nbsp; And it can&#8217;t be done by one party.</p>



<p>So, thank you all so very, very, very much.&nbsp; And as I said, as my Grandpop would say, &#8220;With the grace of God, the goodwill of the neighbors, and the creek not rising, we&#8217;re going to get all this done.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>And &#8212; and I hope you all take a look at my Build Back Better plan that has to do with a lot of other pieces that are &#8212; that the Senate just agreed to move forward on.&nbsp; You may not agree, but take a look at it and see if any of it has a value to your communities.&nbsp; Okay?</p>



<p>Thanks, everybody.&nbsp; I really do appreciate it.&nbsp; Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are you worried about the debt ceiling, Mr. President?</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Nope.&nbsp; They’re not going to let us default.&nbsp; Eight billion –- eight trillion of that is on Republican conscience.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>President Biden believes that health care is a right, not a privilege. No American should have to face difficult choices between paying for their prescription medications or other essential needs. And yet, too many Americans face this exact challenge. On average, Americans pay two to three times as much as people in other countries for prescription drugs, and one in four Americans who take prescription drugs struggle to afford their medications. Pharmaceutical companies do ground-breaking, life-saving work, but there is a difference between developing clinical breakthroughs and driving up prices for the drugs Americans rely on. Change is sorely needed.<br><br>Today, President Biden is laying out his vision for reducing the high cost of prescription drugs. As part of his Build Back Better agenda, he’s calling on Congress to address this crisis and allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices, significantly reducing costs for millions of Americans.</p>



<p>Specifically, the President’s plan includes:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Allowing Medicare to Negotiate Drug Prices.</strong></li></ul>



<p>For every other type of health care service, Medicare works to get the best prices for American seniors. But for prescription drugs – and only prescription drugs – Medicare is prohibited by law from negotiating for the best deal.&nbsp; This needs to change.&nbsp; Medicare should be able to negotiate the price for a subset of expensive drugs that don’t face any competition in the market.&nbsp; Medicare negotiators would be provided a framework for what constitutes a fair price for each drug, and there should be powerful incentives to make sure drug companies agree to a reasonable price.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Making Other Needed Reforms to Lower Prices.</strong></li></ul>



<p>We need to put an end to drug prices rising higher and higher with no end in sight. Drug companies that raise their prices faster than inflation should have to pay a penalty. Furthermore, today, seniors who take expensive drugs can face unlimited exposure to high drug prices. We have to fix this, and establish a firm cap on the amount that Medicare beneficiaries have to pay out-of-pocket for drugs each year.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Building on Existing Progress to Lower the Cost of Prescription Drugs.</strong></li></ul>



<p>These actions would build upon steps the President has taken to make prescription drugs more affordable for all Americans. Last month, President Biden <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/09/fact-sheet-executive-order-on-promoting-competition-in-the-american-economy/">signed an executive order</a> calling upon each Agency to improve competition, increase wages, and reduce prices—including for prescription drugs. Alongside other steps, the federal government will be working with states and Tribes to import safe, lower-cost prescription drugs from Canada and accelerating the development and uptake of generic and biosimilar drugs that give patients the same exact clinical benefit but at a fraction of the price.<br><br>These reforms would <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/healthcare/news/2021/07/20/501803/h-r-3-save-patients-thousands-dollars-prescription-drugs/">lower premiums and copays for millions</a> of Americans. &nbsp;Insulin prices could <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/healthcare/news/2021/07/20/501803/h-r-3-save-patients-thousands-dollars-prescription-drugs/">fall by hundreds of dollars</a> on average.&nbsp;&nbsp; The price for some arthritis medicines might fall by <a href="https://oversight.house.gov/sites/democrats.oversight.house.gov/files/Committee%20on%20Oversight%20and%20Reform%20-%20AbbVie%20Staff%20Report.pdf">more than $2,000 every month</a>.&nbsp; And for some of the most expensive drugs, prices would fall by tens of thousands of dollars per year.&nbsp; These price savings would put money back in seniors’ pockets: a person taking an expensive cancer drug could see their out of pocket costs fall by at least $9,000 a year, and even seniors who don’t take expensive drugs could see their premiums cut. &nbsp;<a href="https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Research/ActuarialStudies/Downloads/HR3-Titles-I-II.pdf">On average, Medicare beneficiaries would save about $200</a>. And it’s not just Medicare beneficiaries that would benefit.&nbsp; If Medicare makes the prices it negotiates available to commercial payers, too, costs for employer health insurance would fall – reducing premiums by tens of billions of dollars or more.</p>



<p>Public opinion <a href="https://www.kff.org/health-costs/poll-finding/kff-health-tracking-poll-may-2021/">polls</a> show that the majority of Americans—Republicans and Democrats—support this change. The Biden-Harris Administration continues to do everything we can to make high quality health care more affordable and accessible. By enabling Medicare to negotiate drug prices, Congress can do its part to bring down costs and secure the health and financial security of our nation’s seniors.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>On the heels of the latest IPCC report, the National Climate Task Force met to discuss delivering on President Biden’s entire Build Back Better agenda in Congress and driving additional climate ambition.</em></p>



<p>Today, National Climate Advisor Gina McCarthy convened the fifth National Climate Task Force meeting where she was joined by Cabinet members and senior leadership from 17 federal agencies. The Task Force discussed the new Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, and its “code red” warning for the global community to take immediate action to avert the worst effects of climate change. This report underscores the need for action and achieving the President’s goal of taking bold action in this decisive decade on the path to economy-wide net zero emissions. Americans are already feeling the effects of climate change – from devastating wildfires to extreme heat to a historic drought – and the IPCC report reminds us that we must act swiftly and decisively to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p>



<p>During the meeting, Biden Administration officials discussed passage of the historic Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal through the Senate, and the Senate’s important step forward to passing the President’s full Build Back Better agenda, which includes creating an energy efficiency clean energy standard, expanding tax cuts for clean electricity, electric vehicles, and clean energy manufacturing, and creating a Civilian Climate Corps.</p>



<p>Additionally, agency leadership shared updates on the Administration’s whole-of-government approach to deliver the President’s vision to build back better:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Council on Environmental Quality Chair Brenda Mallory</strong> and <strong>Acting OMB Director Shalanda Young</strong> discussed the recently-released <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/briefing-room/2021/07/20/the-path-to-achieving-justice40/">Justice40 interim guidance</a> that will ensure the federal government is delivering at least 40 percent of the overall benefits from federal investments in climate and clean energy to disadvantaged communities. The interim guidance identifies a pilot of 21 priority programs that will provide a blueprint for other agencies to help inform their work to implement the Justice40 Initiative across government.</li><li><strong>Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg</strong> and <strong>EPA Administrator Michael Regan</strong> discussed the recent proposed rules issued by their agencies that would establish the most robust standards for fuel efficiency and emissions ever. They also discussed the President’s new goal that half of all vehicle sales be zero-emissions vehicles by 2030, and the accompanying standard-setting actions directed by the President, which will strengthen save consumers money, cut pollution, boost public health, advance environmental justice, and tackle the climate crisis.</li><li><strong>Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland</strong> and <strong>Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack </strong>provided an update on the devastation caused by the current wildfire season and the on-going severe drought that is afflicting communities across the West, including information on how each of their agencies are taking steps to invest in both immediate response efforts and long-term climate resilience to reduce the catastrophic effects of future wildfires and droughts.</li></ul>



<p>As outlined by President Biden’s January 27 <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/27/executive-order-on-tackling-the-climate-crisis-at-home-and-abroad/">Executive Order on Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad</a>, the Task Force is chaired by the National Climate Advisor and includes Cabinet-level leaders from 21 federal agencies and senior White House officials to mobilize the Biden-Harris Administration’s implementation of a whole-of-government approach.</p>



<p>Task Force membership is comprised of the following government officials:</p>



<ul><li>National Climate Advisor (Chair)</li><li>Secretary of the Treasury</li><li>Secretary of Defense</li><li>Attorney General</li><li>Secretary of the Interior</li><li>Secretary of Agriculture</li><li>Secretary of Commerce</li><li>Secretary of Education</li><li>Secretary of Labor</li><li>Secretary of Health and Human Services</li><li>Secretary of Housing and Urban Development</li><li>Secretary of Transportation</li><li>Secretary of Energy</li><li>Secretary of Homeland Security</li><li>Administrator of General Services</li><li>Chair of the Council on Environmental Quality</li><li>Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency</li><li>Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration</li><li>Director of the Office of Management and Budget</li><li>Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy</li><li>Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy</li><li>Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs</li><li>Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism</li><li>Assistant to the President for Economic Policy</li></ul>

<p class="has-text-align-center">East Room</p>



<p>1:43 P.M. EDT<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:  Good afternoon.  Last week, we had good news on job growth: 943,000 jobs created in July &#8212; the seventh-largest month of job creation in U.S. history &#8212; making the administration the first ever to add 4 million jobs in the first six months in office.<br><br>And then, in the past 24 hours, we’ve seen the Senate advance two key pieces of my economic agenda: the bipartisan infrastructure bill and the budget resolution that is the framework for my Build Back Better plan.<br><br>Today, I’m pleased to share more good news with the American people: The latest report on consumer price shows &#8212; prices show that we&#8217;ve expanded some easing &#8212; excuse me, the expected easing we thought was going to come has increased &#8212; that we are &#8212; we&#8217;ve seen a good monthly report.<br><br>The monthly core consumer price index is down by nearly two thirds from its pace over the past three months.<br><br>And when you take out the goods directly impacted by the pandemic, like cars and airplane tickets and month &#8212; the monthly core consumer price index has &#8212; is less than two tenths of 1 percent.  <br><br>So, here’s where we stand: Jobs are up, and monthly price increases have come down.  Economic growth is up to the fastest in 40 years, and unemployment is coming down. <br><br>So, I was &#8212; argued our &#8212; the Biden economic plan is working.  And historic investments are on the way as well.<br><br>This isn’t accidental.  It is the result of our strategy to get shots in arms, grow the economy from the bottom up and the middle out.  And it’s the rest of the &#8212; the result of the American Rescue Plan and everything else that we&#8217;ve done.  And it’s a result of the grit and determination and really hard work of the American people.<br><br>But even with all this progress, a lot of families are still feeling the pinch.  Family budgets remain tight, and paychecks don’t go as far as they need to.  That has been a reality in the millions of households all across America for too long.<br><br>That’s why I want to talk today about what we’re going to do to try to ease the burden on families right now and what we need to do to help them succeed over the longer term.<br><br>First, for millions of families, help is on the way right now, thanks to the American Rescue Plan.  On Friday, about 40 million families will receive their second monthly payment<br>as part of our tax cut for families with children: three hundred and &#8212; $300 for each child under the age of 6, and $250 for every child 6 through the age of 17.  That’s money for diapers, food, rent, school supplies, fees and equipment for a child to join sports teams and dance class.  Most of all, as my dad used to say, it just gives a parent a little bit of breathing room.<br><br>The money is a game changer.  And so, I would argue, for &#8212; for some, it’s literally a lifesaver.<br><br>Economists also tell us that those kinds of tax cuts boost test scores, college attendance, and lifetime earnings for children &#8212; a win-win.<br><br>And that’s why I’m glad that, early this morning, Congress took an important step to make sure that this tax cut for families with children does not expire next year. <br><br>So let’s keep this tax cut going and not raise taxes on middle-class families. <br><br>The second point I&#8217;d like to make is: We’re talking about taking action that alleviates global supply chain challenges that keep prices higher than they should be.<br><br>For example, we&#8217;re &#8212; we&#8217;re tracking congestion at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach &#8212; the largest ports in United States &#8212; where increased shipping traffic, and the challenges of operating safely in a pandemic are creating disruptions.  Those disruptions impact everything from how much our food costs to when deliveries arrive.<br><br>So, my administration is bringing together the port operators, shipping lines, the labor unions, trucking companies, railroads, and others to speed up the port&#8217;s operations. <br><br>Right now, our experts believe &#8212; the major independent forecasters agree as well &#8212; that these bottlenecks and price spikes will reduce as our economy continues to heal. <br><br>And while today&#8217;s consumer price report points in that direction, we will keep a careful eye on inflation each month, and trust the Fed to take appropriate action if and when it&#8217;s needed. <br><br>Third, I&#8217;ve directed my administration to crack down on what some major players are doing in the economy that are keeping prices higher than they need be. <br><br>Take your groceries bill: When big agriculture operations consolidate, they put a squeeze on small and family farms, making them pay more for seed, paying them less for what they produce, and raising prices on what your groceries &#8212; what you pay for your groceries at the grocery store.  <br><br>My executive order opens up competition in the agricultural business, gives more farmers a chance to compete, which will give Americans more food choices at lower cost.<br><br>Fourthly, we are taking action to address gas prices as well.  Today, gas prices are lower than they were early in this decade.  But they’re still high enough to create a pinch on working families.<br><br>One key thing about the infrastructure bill that just passed the Senate is there are no gas tax increases.  No gas tax increases.  I made that absolutely clear that I would not raise gas taxes, and I’m glad everyone in the Senate seemed to agree with that.  But that’s not enough. <br><br>Recently, we’ve seen the price that oil companies pay for a barrel of oil begin to fall, but the cost of gasolines at the pump for more American people hasn’t fallen.  That’s not what you’d expect in a competitive market. <br><br>I want to make sure that nothing stands in the way of oil price declines, leading to lower prices for consumers.  So today, my Director of the Economic &#8212; the National Economic Council has asked the Chair of the Federal Trade Commission to use every available tool to monitor the U.S. gasoline market and address any illegal conduct that might be connect- &#8212; that might be contributing to price increases at the pump while the cost of barrel oil is going down.<br><br>We also made clear to OPEC &#8212; the major oil-exporting nations of the world &#8212; that the production cuts made during the pandemic should be reversed as the global economic &#8212; there as the global economy recovers, in order to lower the prices for consumers.  <br><br>The Child Tax Credit, stepping in to address supply chain challenges, my competition order, the FTC investigation into price gouging &#8212; these are some of the immediate steps we are taking to put more money in your pocket and make that money go further.<br><br>But we also need to do more to bring down the costs that are squeezing families month after month and year after year.  We need to make this economy work better for working families in the long run.<br><br>These challenges were with us long before the pandemic and before I took office.  But as we recover from this crisis, now is the moment to put in place a long-term plan to build back America better &#8212; a plan that will increase opportunities with better jobs and with higher wages; a plan that will lower the everyday costs that strain our budgets and our nation’s families today and long into the future.<br><br>It starts with making investments that we know will make the economy more productive and lead to more growth over the long run.<br><br>Bringing down the costs &#8212; everyday costs that have been taking a bigger and bigger bite out of middle-class families’ incomes &#8212; the expenses that parents &#8212; that keep parents up at night and rob seniors of their dignity: healthcare, prescription drug costs, childcare, education, housing, or caring for an elderly relative or loved one.<br><br>For those who get their health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, the American Rescue Plan allowed us to cover more people at lower premiums &#8212; and lower premiums by an average of 40 percent.  In my Build Back Better plan, we want &#8212; we want to build on that progress. <br><br>Or prescription drugs.  Right now, we pay the highest prescription drug cost prices of any developed nation in the world &#8212; the highest.<br><br>My Build Back Better plan is going to lower predi- &#8212; prescription drug costs by finally giving Medicare the power to negotiate the prices of drug they purchase for the American people, saving Americans hundreds of billions of dollars.<br><br>On top of that, my plan would add hearing, dental, and vision benefits to Medicare.<br><br>Right now, there are hundreds of thousands of Americans who need home- and community-based care services.  My plan expands homecare for older Americans and people with disabilities while improving jobs and the pay for the workers who care for them.<br><br>My plan will also provide access to quality, affordable childcare, with new and upgraded childcare facilities all across the country.  Middle-class families will pay no more than 7 percent of their income for highly qualified care for children up to the age of five.  The most hard-pressed working families will not pay a dime.<br><br>Today, my Council of Economic Advisers and the Office of Management and Budget released a report showing clearly how my Build Back Better plan will lower out-of-pocket expenses for families.<br><br>For example, a family with two parents who together earn $85,000 per year.  They have an adult daughter who lives with them and attends a community college.  They care for an elderly parent who needs arthritis medicine, which costs $5,500 out-of-pocket each year, and an eye exam to get a new pair of glasses. <br><br>Under our Build Back Better plan, their daughter would be eligible for two years of community college free.  That will save them $2,400 a year.  That’s like a $2,400 tax credit.  In addition &#8212; and I should say &#8220;tax cut,&#8221; not just &#8220;credit.&#8221;<br><br>In addition, my plan would cap out-of-pocket expenses and costs for their mom&#8217;s and dad’s prescription drugs, saving that family another $2,400 a year.<br><br>And this new vision &#8212; and the new vision benefit under Medicare would pay for that eye exam and new glasses and lenses, saving $450 a year.<br><br>All told, my plan would save that family making $85,000 a year $5,250.<br><br>And the Build Back Better plan is going to save your family a lot, as well.<br><br>Now, there are a number of &#8212; there&#8217;s been a lot of misleading talk &#8212; which is no surprise, I guess &#8212; about what I’m proposing in my Build Back Better agenda.  It’s not a short-term stimulus; it’s a long-term investment in American families.<br><br>My Republican colleagues have argued that long-term investments in physical infrastructure will grow the economy and reduce inflationary press- &#8212; pressures.  And I thank them for that.  They&#8217;re exactly right.  We agree on that.<br><br>And the same time, it&#8217;s true that long-term investments<br>that bring down the biggest costs that families face &#8212; housing, childcare, education, and healthcare &#8212; these investments will lower out-of-pocket expenses, not raise them.  They will spur more people to work by helping ease the burdens of childcare and senior care that parents, especially mothers, bear &#8212; keeping them out of the job market. <br><br>And they&#8217;ll spread out over the decade.  They’ll make a huge difference for families, but they’ll only make up around 1 percent of our economy&#8217;s &#8212; of our economy each year over the next decade.  And they’re going to be fully paid for.<br><br>This isn’t going to be anything like my predecessor, whose unpaid tax cuts and other spending added nearly $8 trillion in his four years to the national debt.  Eight trillion dollars.  They didn’t even purport to try to pay for their tax cuts, which went straight to the largest corporations and the wealthiest Americans.<br><br>The investments I am proposing will be fully paid for over the long term by having the largest corporations, including the 55 corporations that paid zero federal tax last year, and the super wealthy begin to pay their fair share.  They&#8217;ll still make a lot of money, but pay their fair share.  That means it will actually reduce the national debt, improve our fiscal position over the long run. <br><br>My Build Back Better agenda is fiscally responsible &#8212; the fiscally responsible way to reduce costs for families.<br><br>In fact, we’re hearing economists across the board confirm this.  Moody’s has said that, quote, “worries that the plan will ignite&#8221; &#8212; and this is Moody&#8217;s now &#8212; &#8221; will ignite undesirably high inflation and an overheating economy [is] overdone.”<br><br>Nobel Prize winning economist Joseph Stiglitz said of my plan, and I quote, “There is no conceivable way that they [will] have any significant effect on inflation.”<br><br>Jason Furman of Harvard University has said, quote, “I don’t think the infrastructure bill or reconciliation plan would materially impact inflation over the next decade.”<br><br>So, if your primary concern right now is the cost of living, you should support this plan, not oppose it.  Because a vote against this plan is a vote against lowering the cost of healthcare, housing, childcare, eldercare, and prescription drugs for American families.<br><br>So, let me close with this: We’ve brought this economy back from a cold start.  And there is going to be &#8212; there are going to be some ups and downs.  But I am committed to making sure that our historic economic recovery reaches everyone &#8212; this time, it reaches everyone &#8212; and eases the burden on working families not just this year, but for the years to come.<br><br>So, thank you.  God bless you.  And may God protect our troops.  Thank you.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">James S. Brady Press Briefing Room</p>



<p>12:25 P.M. EDT<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Hi, everyone.  Okay, a couple of items for you at the top.<br><br>The President has said that the challenges of our time &#8212; the challenge of our time is to demonstrate that democracies can deliver by improving the lives of their own people and by addressing the greatest problems facing the wider world.<br><br>In keeping with this commitment, this morning we announced that, in December, the President will bring together leaders from a diverse group of the world’s democracies at a virtual Summit for Democracy to be followed in a &#8212; in roughly a year’s time by a second, in-person summit. <br><br>The virtual summit, to take place on December 9th and 10th, will galvanize commitments and initiatives across three principal themes: defending against authoritarianism, fighting corruption, and promoting respect for human rights.  Following a year of consultation, coordination, and action, President Biden will then invite world leaders to gather once more to showcase progress made on their commitments.<br><br>I also wanted to note that, yesterday, Vice President Harris announced that 2.5 million Americans have signed up for health insurance during the Special Enrollment Period the Biden-Harris administration opened just weeks after taking office. That is 2.5 million more people who can now rest easy knowing they’re covered, and who join the over 30 million people who have health coverage through the Affordable Care Act.<br><br>Thanks to the American Rescue Plan, health insurance is now more affordable than ever.  Families are saving an average of $40 per person, per month; that’s nearly $2,000 per year for a typical family of four. <br><br>And President Biden &#8212; and the President&#8217;s Build Back Better agenda that passed the Senate would extend these savings, helping lower healthcare costs for millions of Americans.<br><br>There are just five days left until the Special Enrollment Period closes on August 15th, and now is the time for anybody that doesn’t have health insurance to go to Healthcare.gov and find a plan that works for them.<br><br>Darlene.<br><br>Q    Thank you, Jen.  The President’s meeting earlier with CEOs on vaccinations &#8212; can you tell us: Were there any decisions reached in there in terms of what else the administration can do to encourage people to become vaccinated? <br><br>And this meeting with, you know, companies who are requiring their staffs to be vaccinated &#8212; is that a sign that the White House is kind of shifting away from encouragement and, you know, supporting the mandates that corporate America is doing?  Is that &#8212; in other words, is that a backdoor way of the White House trying to do the federal mandate that you all have said you can&#8217;t do?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  It’s a front-door way of lifting up private sector companies who are taking steps &#8212; through carrots and sticks, through incentives, and through mandates, in some cases &#8212; to get more people vaccinated and to make sure they&#8217;re protecting their workforce.<br><br>I would note that this was intentionally a diverse group of industries.  So, the airline industry, university systems, healthcare industry, small businesses.  We wanted to share the work they are doing and support these efforts.  And today is an example of us lifting up the private sector taking steps that makes sense &#8212; that show that vaccines are safe, effective, and are the best ways to &#8212; for people to reenter the workforce &#8212; workplaces safely and also reboot our economy.  So that was the objective. <br><br>I wouldn&#8217;t say it was meant to be a decision meeting as much as a discussion about best practices, what is working for these industries.  And hopefully, they can be the models for others.<br><br>Q    And then just a couple on the Senate.  Is there a deadline for when the President would want to see the budget reconciliation bill passed?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  As soon as he can sign it into law.  He looks forward to signing it into law.  But we know, as was announced yesterday, the House is going to be coming back next week.  They&#8217;re eager to get to work.  We’ll be deeply engaged in conversations when they return as well.<br><br>Q    And then just one more quick one.  With reluctance from Senators Sinema and Manchin on the $3.5 trillion, can the President envision accepting a smaller dollar figure than $3.5 trillion?  Or is &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Look, I&#8217;m naturally not going to negotiate from here, not that any of you are expecting me to do that.  I will say that what is vital to the President is that &#8212; and what Leader Schumer also reiterated in his press conference this morning, is that this reconciliation package includes the Build Back Better agenda, key investments in childcare, in &#8212; additional investments in climate change, addressing the climate crisis, additional investments to lower costs for people across the country. <br><br>He has certainly expressed a comfort with the $3.5 trillion size, as you &#8212; as you all know, and obviously there&#8217;s a lot of work ahead as we work to gather support for the &#8212; this package.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q    Does the White House know who in Florida made the request for hundreds of more ventilators from the Strategic National Stockpile?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Well, I would say, Kaitlan, I saw the remarks and comments by the governor and representatives of the governor. <br><br>I would note that, as a policy, we don&#8217;t send ventilators to states without their interest in receiving the ventilators.  I think the most important question here is: Why would you oppose receiving ventilators when you clearly need those in your state, given the percentage of hospitalizations that are occurring in Florida? <br><br>Q    Do you think it’s feasible the governor was unaware that those ventilators were sent to his state earlier this week?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  I think that&#8217;s really a question for the governor and his team.<br><br>Q    And one more question: What is the President&#8217;s reaction to the jump in consumer prices?  And what is his level of concern today now seeing those numbers with inflation?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Well, Kaitlan, if you actually look at the numbers and the trends over the last several months, it shows that core inflation, one, was not only below expectations, but it decelerated from last month and even from the month prior.  So, over the last couple of months, we actually saw it trended downward over the last three months, and that is an encouraging sign. <br><br>We also continue to believe that, as the economy turns back on and as people are &#8212; as businesses are starting to move, as the supply &#8212; as the demands start to change in the economy, that there will be transitory impacts in &#8212; as it relates to inflation.  Those are projections that have been made, of course, not just by the Federal Reserve, but by CBO, Goldman Sachs, UBS, Moody&#8217;s, and others.  They&#8217;ve also all predicted that the &#8212; that inflation will come down next year, and that those are the projections that we have abide by.<br><br>Go ahead, Jeff.<br><br>Q    Jen, a question about OPEC.  The White House is pressing OPEC to produce more oil.  Have you gotten a response from Saudi Arabia about that request?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Well, first I would say this is just an outreach that&#8217;s just happening over the last couple of days, but it&#8217;s also ongoing and something that isn&#8217;t new, as of today or even as of yesterday.  We&#8217;ve had ongoing engagements. <br><br>I know we talked about this just a couple of weeks ago when we were especially concerned or where there &#8212; when there OPE- &#8212; discussions with OPEC-member countries happening, even though we&#8217;re not a member of OPEC. <br><br>So the steps that were announced this morning, which include &#8212; as you referenced, Jeff &#8212; National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan putting out a statement about how White House officials are continuing their engagement with relevant OPEC members on the importance of competitive markets and setting prices and doing more to support recovery, it also includes a letter that was sent from our NEC Director, Brian Deese, to the FTC to consider &#8212; encourage them to consider using all of its available tools to monitor the U.S. gasoline markets. <br><br>So this is not meant to be for immediate response, necessarily.  It&#8217;s meant to be a long-term engagement &#8212; consistent, long-term engagement, as we work to address not just anti-competitive behavior in the United States, but in the global marketplace as well.  And also taking steps that we feel are prudent to keep gas prices down for the American public.<br><br>Q    I have a broader question on that theme.  How do you square &#8212; how does this White House square a push for OPEC &#8212; or Saudi Arabia to increase production of oil, which is a fossil fuel, with your climate change agenda, which is basically to get away from fossil fuels?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Well, first I&#8217;d say, Jeff, that experts have consistently debunked the notion that efforts we&#8217;re undertaking to transition to net zero by 2050 and a clean power sector by 2035 are related to domestic production at home.  I would just note.  I know that wasn&#8217;t exactly your question, but I wanted to get that in there. <br><br>Our view is, one, that there are steps OPEC can take.  What we&#8217;re &#8212; what we&#8217;re raising here, as we&#8217;ve raised in the past: production and the need to increase production, as you&#8217;ve said, to make sure we have that available to help address the price of gas. <br><br>We also are talking though, most importantly, about &#8212; about competition and about ensuring that pricing on the global market is something that is aligned with what is fair and what is competitive as well. <br><br>So, we&#8217;re talking about a number of steps, not just one.  But I&#8217;d also note that we know that they have supply that&#8217;s available, that can be accessed, and that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re really referring to here.<br><br>Q    Just one other foreign policy question.  Is the White House or the U.S. supporting Canada in any way with its back-and-forth with China about two people &#8212; one who’s been convicted to death for drug smuggling and another who’s been sentenced now to 11 years for spying? <br><br>MS. PSAKI:  We have spoken out about this in the past, and I believe the State Department has.  I would certainly point you to them on any particular comments &#8212; new comments, I should say.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q    Thanks, Jen.  On Afghanistan, last month, the administration shared that the objective was to get individuals who are eligible relocated out of Afghanistan in advance of the U.S. troop withdrawal at the end of August.  Given the speed of the Taliban offensive, is that still the timeline?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  It continues to be.  We continue to work to expedite that, to ensure we get SIV applicants who are eligible out of the country, both to Fort Lee &#8212; our base here in the United States &#8212; and also to third-party countries.  But there have been a number of flights that have already been conducted &#8212; already been implemented, and we&#8217;re continuing to work to expedite moving these applicants out of the country.<br><br>Q    Okay.  And one more on that.  The administration&#8217;s view has been that the Afghan forces have what they need.  They&#8217;ve got the equipment.  They&#8217;ve got the forces to fight back.  But the Taliban now controls about 60 percent of the territory in Afghanistan.  Isn&#8217;t it clear that the Afghans, at this point, don&#8217;t really have control?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Well, I think our point here is, Stephanie, is that we have &#8212; we were &#8212; we are continued &#8212; we will continue to provide close air support, making sure the Air Force functions are operable.  We will continue to resupply their forces with food and equipment, pay all their salaries, in addition to all of the assistance we&#8217;ve provided over the last 20 years.<br><br>I&#8217;d also note &#8212; and this is a question that came up yesterday &#8212; that the train, advise, and assist approach that we have been implementing and the range of assistance we&#8217;ve provided was done in coordination with military leaders &#8212; and the implementation and designing of that plan with military leaders and civilian leaders in Afghanistan over the last several years. <br><br>So our larger point here is: Ultimately, the Afghan National Security Defense Forces have the equipment, numbers, and training to fight back.  They have what they need.  What they need to determine is if they have the political will to fight back, and if they have the ability to unite as a &#8212; as leaders to fight back.  And that&#8217;s really where it stands at this point.<br><br>Q    A quick question.  That air support is supposed to end in the next few weeks &#8212; that U.S. air support.  What &#8212; what happens after August 31st when those 600 troops are still there, trying to protect the U.S. Embassy and the airport, and that air support is gone?  Will that be looked at again to continue it, or what happens from there? <br><br>MS. PSAKI:  I don&#8217;t &#8212; it&#8217;s a good question.  I don&#8217;t have any update on that for you at this point in time.  I will note that the President still made an extensive request for assistance &#8212; security assistance, humanitarian assistance &#8212; different from your question, but still relevant &#8212; for Afghanistan in his FY &#8217;22 budget. <br><br>So our assistance, our partnership does not end.  I understand you&#8217;re asking specifically about support &#8212; air support, but he made a significant request, and certainly will continue to work to get that money through and to the Afghan leadership.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q    Thank you.  The fact that this Summit on Democracies is virtual, in December, is that an indication that most global diplomacy this fall may be conducted virtually and not in person?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Not necessarily.  I think we&#8217;re assessing and &#8212; as are other leaders and countries &#8212; assessing what steps are prudent to take, given we&#8217;re still in a fight &#8212; in a global fight with the &#8212; with COVID. <br><br>This &#8212; we need to plan, of course.  There are a number of leaders who will be invited.  And this was a decision we made, also given &#8212; based on, also, engagements and discussions with a number of these leaders.  But I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s indicative of, kind of, everything going virtual at this point.<br><br>Q    One other on COVID.  The President has talked about the American &#8220;arsenal&#8221; of vaccines, but a group of public health experts, this week, wrote a letter to the President urging him to export the 55 million stockpiled vaccine doses abroad.  Can you remind us of what the plan is for that stockpile?  Is it to be booster shots, or are they just part of the donation stream that will go out to the rest of the world?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Well, I think, first, it&#8217;s important to note that, one, we hit, last week, a mi- &#8212; an important milestain [sic] &#8212; milestone of sharing over 120 million &#8212; 110 million, sorry &#8212; vaccines to the world.  We also started shipting [sic] &#8212; shipping doses today to CARICOM countries.  And, every day, we&#8217;re making progress against a once-in-a-generation pandemic. <br><br>We are still the world&#8217;s largest provider of vaccines to the global community.  We are still a huge advocate for TRIP [sic] &#8212; the TRIPS waiver, which would allow that information to be shared for manufacturing pergeses [sic] &#8212; purposes with countries around the world. <br><br>So &#8212; and we have also conveyed  and we have done &#8212; and are &#8212; implement this already, to date &#8212; that when we have extra doses, we will share those. <br><br>So, I think the point here is that we are &#8212; the United States is the arsenal of vaccines to the global community.  We are &#8212; by far and away, in terms of what we&#8217;ve donated; by far and away of what we&#8217;ve committed; by far and away in our partnership with Quad countries &#8212; we&#8217;re on track to produce at least 1 billion doses of COVID vaccines in India for the Asia region by the end of 2022. <br><br>But it also requires other countries in the global community &#8212; other wealthy countries stepping up and doing more to contribute. <br><br>So, that&#8217;s what I would note.<br><br>Q    One other &#8212; and, look, the President &#8212; as President, wherever he is, we go wherever he goes.  Is there anything to this &#8212; and we know that this week&#8217;s original work-from-somewhere-else or vacation plan was upended by the Senate.  But this whole going back to Wilmington, then to Camp David, then back to Wilmington &#8212; is there something to that?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Certainly not.  It&#8217;s just a &#8212; just his travel logistics plans. <br><br>Q    There’s no reason to leave Wilmington for the weekend and go to Camp David instead?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  You mean instead of &#8212; what do you &#8212; I&#8217;m sorry.  He&#8217;s &#8212;<br><br>Q    Why not just stay in Wilmington? <br><br>MS. PSAKI:  He likes Camp David.  It&#8217;s a place to be outside, spend time with family, and certainly has beautiful, beautiful scenery there. <br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q    Thank you, Jen.  The President is saying now, &#8220;God willing, the FDA is going to be coming out in a reasonable timeframe to say this vaccine is totally safe.&#8221;  What is the holdup in nominating someone to run the FDA after more than 200 days in office?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  I know, it&#8217;s like 204 at this point in time.<br><br>Q    Two hundred and four days in office.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Certainly, I will say &#8212; and the President was asked this question yesterday &#8212; that he wants to name someone who&#8217;s qualified, who&#8217;s ready to lead the FDA.  It is a priority for him.  He&#8217;s also not going to take a step to put forward a nominee before he&#8217;s found exactly the right person. <br><br>I will note that it is a place that is filled with talented, experienced scientists, data experts, career staff who are certainly running the FDA effectively.<br><br>Q    Okay.  And as the President tries to reach unvaccinated Americans, has there been any thought given &#8212; looking back &#8212; to the possibility that he may have created some vaccine hesitancy when, last year around this time, the previous administration was rushing to get a vaccine authorized and the now-President said, “I trust vaccines.  I trust scientists.  But I don&#8217;t trust Donald Trump.  And at this moment, the American people can’t either.” </p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I think it&#8217;s safe to say he still doesn&#8217;t trust Donald Trump, so that hasn&#8217;t changed.&nbsp; But he does trust scientists.&nbsp; He does trust data experts.&nbsp; And he does trust the people leading the CDC, the FDA, which is the gold standard of approval for vaccines.<br><br>I&#8217;d also note, because this question often comes up, that the President has repeatedly given credit to scientists and experts from the prior administration, even as recently as just a few weeks ago, for their role in moving the vaccines forward.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, but at the time when Donald Trump is out there saying, “We’re going to have a vaccine in the next couple weeks, next couple months,” and Joe Biden is out on the campaign trail saying, “Don&#8217;t trust Donald Trump,” did that create any kind of vaccine hesitancy?&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Not that we&#8217;ve seen in the data.&nbsp; I would note that at the time, just for context, the former President was also suggesting people inject versions of poison into their veins to cure COVID.&nbsp; So I think that&#8217;s a relevant point.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And Joe Biden, then-Vice President, was saying we got to wait until something is fully authorized, and it&#8217;s still not.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, the FDA works on the timeline of science.&nbsp; At the same time, we&#8217;ve also seen tens of millions of people&#8217;s lives saved who have gotten the vaccine.&nbsp; That data is clear across the country.<br><br>Go ahead.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Back on Afghanistan, Jen.&nbsp; The President made his view clear yesterday that he doesn’t regret his decision, but a U.S.&nbsp;intelligence official is telling CBS News that Kabul could come under pressure in a month or two.&nbsp; And if that happens, the entire Afghan government could collapse in as little as 90 days from today.&nbsp; Does the President dispute that assessment?&nbsp; Or does he accept it as the likely outcome?&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, we don&#8217;t rely on anonymous assessments.&nbsp; We rely on the intelligence assessments made by the U.S. government.&nbsp; They have put out public assessments which, certainly, we stand by.&nbsp;<br><br>We are closely watching the deteriorating security conditions in parts of the country, but no particular outcome, in our view, is inevitable.&nbsp;<br><br>We will continue to coordinate airstrikes with and in support of Afghan forces.&nbsp; And as the President made clear, Afghan leaders have to come together and the future of the country is really on their shoulders.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, let me ask you: The Taliban is clearly on the march.&nbsp; Your objective is to have a negotiated political settlement.&nbsp; What gives you confidence that the Taliban is interested in that?&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, the Taliban has to make an assessment &#8212; one, we have also said that there&#8217;s no question that the Afghan National Defense Security Forces would be strengthened, as would the Afghan political leadership, if they were to have more success in fighting back.&nbsp; There&#8217;s no question about that.&nbsp; We&#8217;re not hiding from that in any way, shape, or form.&nbsp;<br><br>The Taliban also has to make an assessment about what they want their role to be in the international community.&nbsp; And I know that Ambassador Khalilzad made comments when he was at the political negotiations yesterday making clear that the international community is going to watch closely how the Taliban behaves.&nbsp; They have a range of tools in their arsenal, as well, to take steps should they choose.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are you aware of any safeguards for American materiel that may fall into the Taliban hands if they continue to take over more land in Afghanistan?&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, we certainly take that risk seriously.&nbsp; It is a concern of ours, as it would be in any warzone where we provide assistance.&nbsp; We did take steps to retrograde some of the equipment over the past several months in preparation for that possibility.&nbsp; But we do take that seriously; we watch it closely, as well.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, across the country right now, as you know, a lot of companies are trying to make decisions on their return-to-work dates.&nbsp; What, if any, decisions has the President made about when the federal workforce needs to be back in the office?&nbsp; Where does that stand for federal employees?&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, we&#8217;ve already brought all of the White House employees in &#8212; on the executive complex back to work.&nbsp; And, obviously, agencies are implementing on their own timelines to do exactly that as well.&nbsp;<br><br>As you know, we announced, just a couple of weeks ago, steps we were putting in place &#8212; attestations that would be required of federal employees.&nbsp; If they&#8217;re not vaccinated, they&#8217;re going to have to be in a testing regime.&nbsp; It&#8217;s going to take a little bit of time to have that implemented, even as agencies are hard at work getting it done.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, there has been some dates floated as, like, early September by which some of these employees would be coming back.&nbsp; Is the expectation that employees will be coming back in the next several weeks?&nbsp; Or has this complicated the situation, given the surge of the variant?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; It has not complicated.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve put in place specific guidelines and specific requirements from the federal government.&nbsp; We also trust that each agency is going to have their own implementation plan for how they can have in place a testing regime in order to keep their workforce safe.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We’ll follow up on this when we talk to the COVID-19 Response Team at the next opportunity, but what is the assessment that the White House has received in terms of projection for when this Delta variant would reach its peak?&nbsp; When should we anticipate that that would happen?&nbsp; What, if any, preparations are being made in anticipation of that time?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I certainly do encourage you to ask our scientists, as I know you will.&nbsp; Part of it is dependent on the actions and steps that the American people take across the country to get vaccinated, to wear masks, to protect themselves, to reduce the spread of the virus.<br><br>We have seen, in states where there was &#8212; where there was a rise in COVID cases, even a week or two ago, obviously, an increase in vaccination rates, but &#8212; and also a start to see a leveling off in some of those states.&nbsp; That&#8217;s a positive sign.&nbsp;<br><br>I&#8217;d also remind everyone, as you all know, that when &#8212; if somebody gets their shot tomorrow, they&#8217;re not &#8212; they&#8217;re not protected the next day; they need to get their second shot, and then it&#8217;s a couple of weeks after that.&nbsp;<br><br>So, it is going to take a little bit of time, even as we&#8217;ve seen an increase in vaccination rates in a number of states across the country.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But you receive assessments, obviously, from them.&nbsp; What is the assessment?&nbsp; When should Americans on this trajectory, or even if there is a best-case-scenario trajectory, when should we anticipate this surge to peak?&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, again, I encourage you to ask our scientists and our experts who are tracking exactly that &#8212; an important question.&nbsp; But it&#8217;s also dependent on the steps that we are taking and people across the country are taking to get vaccinated and protect themselves.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the near term, are there conversations about the potential for field hospitals &#8212; much the same way that you produce mass vaccination sites in some places?&nbsp; Some of the states right now don&#8217;t have sufficient resources to care for the number of hospitalized individuals.&nbsp; Are those conversations taking place?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We are in touch with every governor, and we have offered assistance &#8212; federal assistance, strike forces.&nbsp; Every state needs something different.&nbsp; In states that have higher rates of COVID, obviously you need even more assistance.&nbsp; And we are prepared to provide any kind of assistance that&#8217;s going to help stem the flow of &#8212; the rise of the virus.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, I know you’ll tell us &#8212; it&#8217;s a simple question &#8212; has the President spoken to the soon-to-be governor of New York yet, Kathy Hochul?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Not yet, but we expect him to do that in the coming days.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What message does he communicate?&nbsp; What message would he want to share publicly with the soon-to-be first female governor of the state of New York?&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll do a readout after the meeting, but I will tell you that he would convey to her, “I&#8217;m looking forward to working with you&#8221; &#8212; with her &#8212; &#8220;to continue to get the pandemic under control, to put the people of New York back to work, and to move forward as a federal and state partners.”&nbsp;<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Can I go back to the OPEC announcement &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; this morning?&nbsp; The timing, of course, in the hours before the CPI announcement, kind of, lends an impression or a question of whether there&#8217;s a domestic-political lens for you.&nbsp; What, if any, tools do you have to pressure OPEC, other than, you know, a letter from Jake Sullivan, to actually take steps to increase production?&nbsp; Or is it just the U.S. sort of doing it for political benefit?&nbsp; Because that might be how they view it.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, we don&#8217;t see it through a political lens.&nbsp; We believe that, one, the President&#8217;s role in addressing competition doesn&#8217;t stop at the border’s edge.&nbsp; And while we encouraged OPEC, as you know &#8212; I know you cover this closely &#8212; to take steps, or OPEC countries to take steps to increase supply, back several weeks ago, we believe this needs to be a continuous and ongoing conversation and we need to elevate this issue in public and, certainly, in the global community. &nbsp;It&#8217;s just one step in our toolbox to continue to keep prices down for the public.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there anything domestically that the U.S. would consider to do to incentivize increased production here?&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would also note that &#8212; that our NEC Director, I should say, sent a letter to the FTC as well, encouraging them to consider looking at available tools to monitor the U.S. gasoline market.<br><br>As you know, what we&#8217;ve seen, this isn&#8217;t the first time this has happened.&nbsp; But even as oil prices go down, gas prices take a longer time to come down.<br><br>Now, gas prices are still aligned with where they were back in 2018.&nbsp; But we know this is going to be &#8212; and they often go up in the summer; we&#8217;ve seen that trend over and over again.&nbsp; But this is a long-term issue, and we want to send a clear message that we are going to take steps, whether they are using the bully pulpit or otherwise, to make sure we are going after anti-competitive behavior.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right.&nbsp; But that is a different question than increasing production.&nbsp; You&#8217;re asking OPEC to increase production.&nbsp; Is there anything the U.S. &#8212; the U.S. producers can do to increase production or that you, as the administration, would consider doing to make U.S. &#8212; more U.S. oil?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, that wasn’t an ask we made.&nbsp; The point we have made in these communications is that we do have the sup- &#8212; we&#8217;re not making a supply question here &#8212; or we&#8217;re not posing a supply question domestically.&nbsp; Obviously, OPEC has its own unique role on the global marketplace.&nbsp;<br><br>We do also think that there should not be any price gouging at the pump when there is available oil, so that is what we are highlighting and marking out there.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks so much, Jen.&nbsp; Ken Salazar was just confirmed as ambassador for Mexico.&nbsp; He&#8217;s just the first ambassador, for a country, to be confirmed.&nbsp; Is this something that the President is concerned about?&nbsp; What is he, what is the White House doing about, kind of, the slow pace of confirmations of ambassadors?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, while we are grateful for the important work the Senate did before recess by passing the bipartisan infrastructure bill and certainly taking an important step forward on the President&#8217;s Build Back Better agenda, we are frustrated over the slow pace of confirmations, particularly for non-controversial nominees.&nbsp; A number of these nominees who are sitting and waiting are highly qualified.&nbsp; They have &#8212; a number of them have a lot of Republican support.&nbsp; So, what is the holdup?<br><br>And as you noted, it&#8217;s important for us around the world to have qualified ambassadors who are confirmed by the Senate to lead our country and represent our country at this point in time.&nbsp; There are also a number of other positions at the Treasury Department, at other domestic agencies that could play a pivotal role as our country is continuing to deal with an economic recovery.<br><br>I would also note that, just for data purposes, the President has sent over more nominees at this point than his predecessor and a comparable amount of nominees to Presidents Obama and Bush.&nbsp; Right now, we have nearly 275 people we&#8217;ve nominated pending confirmation by the Senate &#8212; a number of them who have strong Republican support as well.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, a few of the recent nominations last week were donors.&nbsp; What &#8212; the President, during the campaign, promised to put diplomacy back in the hands of professionals.&nbsp; What is the makeup that the White House is kind of shooting for in regards to percentage of political versus career, diversity?&nbsp; How are you balancing that &#8212; those political (inaudible) of donors &#8212; especially after some diplomats feel after four years of Trump and the withdrawal from the world mean there should be more career people?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, the President has made clear that he supports, advocates for, and will continue to press for the confirmation of career ambassadors, of course.&nbsp; But also that individuals who are in the private sector &#8212; that does not mean that they&#8217;re unqualified.&nbsp; These are qualified nominees who can be excellent representatives of the United States overseas.&nbsp;<br><br>And we are also going to simultaneously continue to push for and press for and elevate career staff, Foreign Service Officers who&#8217;ve proudly served our country, through Democrats and Republicans, to serve in these posts as well.&nbsp; And those are all on the slate of nominees we&#8217;re pushing to move forward.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Obama and Bush had about 30 percent political.&nbsp; Is that, kind of, a range that the Biden administration is seeking for?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have a percentage for you.&nbsp; I can tell you that &#8212; and I&#8217;m happy to check with our personnel department to see if there&#8217;s anything they want to provide.<br><br>I will note that diversity has been a front-and-center priority for the President, for this administration, and for our personnel department as they look to fill key posts &#8212; not just ambassador roles, but roles to serve in high-level positions in agencies.<br><br>Go ahead, Michael.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; It&#8217;s the 40th birthday of Austin Tice, a journalist who went missing in Syria nine years ago this week.&nbsp; And his family put out a statement today. I was going to read just a short portion of it for you:<br><br><em>&#8220;We are now imploring a third President to communicate to his administration that Austin&#8217;s secure release and safe return is a priority.&nbsp; There are many capable people working in our government who are eager to see Austin walk free; they must have President Biden&#8217;s authorization for significant and relevant diplomatic engagement with the Syrian government.&#8221;&nbsp;</em><br><br>What has the President done, publicly or internally, to communicate that this is a priority?&nbsp; And when will we hear from him directly?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would note that, first, this week, as you noted, marks his ninth year in captivity in Syria.&nbsp; I talked about the detainment of Austin Tice when I was in a prior administration, two administrations ago, and that tells you how long his family has been waiting.<br><br>We&#8217;d certainly reiterate our call for Syria to help release &#8212; on Syria to help release Austin Tice and every U.S. citizen held hostage in Syria.&nbsp; We are committed to following all avenues and talking to anyone who can help with Austin&#8217;s release and return home.<br><br>We don&#8217;t speak about those publicly because that&#8217;s not in the interest of the outcome, but we are committed to working &#8212; to doing &#8212; using every tool in our disposal to bring Austin and all hostages held in Syria home.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I just want to follow up because it seems as if there&#8217;s a feeling that there needs to be an explicit directive from the President, whether it be publicly or privately, and &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; He is directing Syria to release Austin Tice, and we are using &#8212; and he has asked his government to use every tool and &#8212; tool of engagement available to bring him home.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve got two questions.&nbsp; One, domestic and &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Jake, it&#8217;s your birthday today.&nbsp; You noted that for me.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, it is.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Happy birthday.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; And let me wish you back, &#8220;Happy Infrastructure Week.&#8221;&nbsp; (Laughter.)<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Same, same.&nbsp; We all get cakes, so it&#8217;s good.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, one quick question about infrastructure.&nbsp; With the infrastructure bill just having passed overwhelmingly in the Senate and headed for the House, is there anything the American people should anticipate in terms of the next big push for bipartisan legislation?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, the door to the Oval Office is always going to be open to bipartisan work, bipartisan engagement.&nbsp; There is work that we expect to proceed in the fall, including work on CHIPS legislation, helping to address issues in our supply chain that are impacting American workers and American companies.<br><br>We certainly believe that Congress should follow historic precedent and raise the debt limit, as they have three times during the former President&#8217;s administration and 80 times overall.<br><br>And there is work &#8212; there are issues that have historically received bipartisan support, including on immigration, including on steps to make our workforce more competitive, address our competition with China.&nbsp; So, there&#8217;s a number of opportunities.&nbsp; We look forward to seeing what openness there is on the other side of the aisle as well.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then a follow-up on Afghanistan &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I think we&#8217;ve got to keep going.<br><br>Go ahead.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Afghanistan &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Forty-six Republican senators have now signed a letter saying they will not vote to raise the debt limit.&nbsp; So what is the White House&#8217;s, kind of, plan?&nbsp; What conversations are you having with Congress to make sure the U.S. doesn’t default on its debt?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would say we are making absolutely clear that raising the debt limit is something that has been done historically &#8212; 80 times &#8212; in a bipartisan fashion &#8212; the vast majority, more times under Republican Presidents than Democratic Presidents.&nbsp;<br><br>And when we&#8217;re talking about what debt we&#8217;re dealing with here, most of it &#8212; 99 percent of it, I believe &#8212; is from &#8212; existed before President Biden took office.<br><br>So, we understand what their public comments are to date.&nbsp; Congress will return in September.&nbsp; And certainly, we know the private sector &#8212; that former leaders from both sides of the aisle are eager to see Congress raise the debt limit and not face default.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So is passing this through regular order, not in reconciliation &#8212; is that a red line for the President?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I&#8217;m not here to set red lines.&nbsp; I think there&#8217;s a standard precedent we&#8217;re looking for Congress to follow.&nbsp;<br><br>Go ahead.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Following up on that, Jen, what is the White House reaction &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Go ahead.&nbsp; Go ahead.&nbsp; Go ahead.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jen. I appreciate it.&nbsp; There are still roughly 2,000 inmates who were released to home confinement through the CARES Act.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve reported that the Biden administration deemed that the Trump administration was correct in interpreting that that authority would basically end at the end of the pandemic.&nbsp; Would the President prefer issuing clemency to those inmates, seeing a legislative fix that keep them on home confinement?&nbsp; Or is he okay seeing them returned back to prison &#8212; most of them?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I saw your reporting.&nbsp; We all did, of course.&nbsp; We are working hard every day to reform our justice system in order to strengthen families, boost our economy, give people a chance at a better future.&nbsp;<br><br>As part of this, the President is deeply committed to reducing incarceration, helping people successfully reenter society.&nbsp; And he has said too many people are incarcerated &#8212; too many are Black and brown.&nbsp; And he is therefore exploring multiple avenues to provide relief for &#8212; to certain nonviolent drug offenders, including through the use of his clemency power.&nbsp;<br><br>I don&#8217;t have anything to preview for you today, but he is, again, looking at a range of avenues.&nbsp;<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, the gallerist managing &#8212; who has been tasked with ensuring the buyers of Hunter Biden&#8217;s artwork remain anonymous &#8212; he said that Hunter will be attending his opening as well, next month.&nbsp; And he has said friends and family will be attending as well.&nbsp; Does the President and First Lady plan on attending that &#8212; that opening?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I&#8217;m not aware of plans for them to attend.<br><br>Go ahead, Rachel.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; On the nominations again, I know that Secretary Blinken called for the nomination of Deborah Lipstadt as Special Envoy to Combat Anti-Semitism last week on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.&nbsp; What kind of communications has the White House had with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on her nomination and on others as well?&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We&#8217;ve been in close touch with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, as well as a range of leaders in the Senate about our desire to get qualified nominees confirmed.<br><br>I&#8217;d note that I gave the number earlier: 275 nominees &#8212; qualified, experienced &#8212; many of them former public servants who are eager to serve our country around the world and in the United States &#8212; are waiting.&nbsp;<br><br>They&#8217;re ready to serve.&nbsp; They&#8217;re ready to be in their roles.&nbsp; Some of them are international.&nbsp; Some of them are domestic.&nbsp; And many of them have brought Republican support.&nbsp;<br><br>I&#8217;d note there&#8217;s also been a significant amount of outreach from the State Department on these nominees.&nbsp; I&#8217;d certainly point you to them to outline the specifics of that.<br><br>Go ahead, Patsy.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; I have a question on the Democracy Summit, but, first, before that, I have two foreign policy questions.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Okay.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So Amnesty International released a report today documenting systemic rape and sexual violence against girls and women in the Tigray region in Ethiopia.&nbsp; How do you respond to that report?&nbsp; And does the administration plan to do more to help stop these atrocities?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, we are closely engaged with countries in the region, leaders in the region, and certainly horrified by what we&#8217;ve seen as ongoing human rights abuses in Ethiopia.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s something I would certainly point you to the State Department for more extensive detail about our work there.&nbsp;<br><br>We have put out a number of statements from administration officials on this particular issue, and we will continue to elevate it publicly.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And on Haiti: Senators Rubio and Menendez just sent the letter earlier this week to the President Biden, expressing concern about the political crisis in Haiti following the assassination.&nbsp; Has the President responded?&nbsp; And how does he plan to respond?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I&#8217;m not sure we&#8217;ve seen that letter.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not &#8212; I&#8217;m not familiar with it.<br><br>Go ahead.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; And the Democracy Summit, Jen?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I think we got to keep going just to get to more people.<br><br>Go ahead.<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.&nbsp; Two quick questions &#8212; one domestic, one foreign policy.&nbsp; Domestically, you may have seen a statement put out by Senator Joe Manchin in regards to the three and a half trillion dollar so-called “human infrastructure” bill.&nbsp; He seems very skeptical about the size of it.&nbsp; Do you view him as a team player?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Absolutely.&nbsp; And a key partner to the President in moving our agenda forward.&nbsp;<br><br>I did see his statement &#8212; or we all saw his statement.&nbsp; I&#8217;d note that I think he&#8217;s conf- &#8212; he&#8217;s confounding a couple of things in there.&nbsp; One, the Build Back Better agenda could also be called the “cost-cutting agenda” for working families.&nbsp; “Build Back Better” sounds better.&nbsp;<br><br>But what it will actually do &#8212; and we have a report that just went out or should be going out from CEA and OMB &#8212; it makes clear that a big outcome, a big impact of the Build Back Better agenda is lowering costs &#8212; bringing down costs on childcare, healthcare, prescription drugs, preschool, costs of college, commuting, even household expenses.&nbsp; That&#8217;s what the long-term impact is.<br><br>This is also an eight-year investment to make us more competitive.&nbsp; It’s not about putting a huge amount of money into the economy over the next few months, but these are critical investments, and that&#8217;s also why a number of inflation hawks, I should note, are fully supportive of it.&nbsp;<br><br>Jason Furman, my old friend and colleague, said, “I don&#8217;t think the infrastructure bill or reconciliation plan would materially impact inflation over the next decade.”&nbsp; I raise that because I know that was something that he expressed.&nbsp;<br><br>It would also be fully paid for by raising &#8212; by asking the wealthiest Americans and companies to pay a bit more.<br><br>So those are some things I think were unintentionally confounded in the statement.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then on foreign policy.&nbsp; As you know, seven provincial capitals in Afghanistan have fallen in just the past two weeks.&nbsp; National security hawks attribute that directly to the decision by President Biden to announce the withdrawal of U.S. forces by the end of this month.&nbsp; What&#8217;s your reaction to those critics who criticize the President&#8217;s plans for Afghanistan?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I think our reaction is: The President &#8212; every Commander-in-Chief and President has to make difficult choices about what&#8217;s in the national interests of the United States.&nbsp;<br><br>And when he gave his speech, just a couple of months ago, delivered a speech outlining why he was making this decision, he touched on a couple of pieces.&nbsp;<br><br>One, we&#8217;ve been at war &#8212; at war in Afghanistan for 20 years, and it is far &#8212; long past time to bring troops home.&nbsp;<br><br>Two, our counterterrorism threats have changed.&nbsp; They are no longer emanating from &#8212; in the same capacity from Afghanistan.&nbsp; We need to have capacity and counterterrorism capacity to address threats from other parts of the world &#8212; Northern Africa, and others.&nbsp;<br><br>Three, because of the timeline that was set by the prior administration of May 1st, if we had left our troops there, the Taliban would be shooting at our troops.&nbsp; He asked his team for a clear-eyed assessment of what the impact is; we put out intelligence assessments.&nbsp; And we will continue to be partners with the Afghan governments militarily, humanitar- &#8212; from a humanitarian perspective moving forward.<br><br>I didn&#8217;t mean to skip you.&nbsp; Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No, you&#8217;re fine.&nbsp; Back to the Senate, which recessed without taking any significant action on voting rights.&nbsp; And I think Mitch McConnell said something akin to, “You know, it’s not going to happen tonight.&nbsp; It’s not going to happen when we come back.”&nbsp; What, if anything, is the White House doing to sort of push the issue forward over the next month?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would say first that Leader Schumer made clear that he disagrees with that assessment, and he is the Leader of the Senate.&nbsp; So he has indicated that he wants to continue to press for voting rights, on legislation, and moving things forward.&nbsp;<br><br>I expect we&#8217;ll &#8212; you&#8217;ll see a comment from the President on this particular issue and his ongoing commitment to addressing voting rights and making sure we are prote- &#8212; protecting and defending peosle [sic] &#8212; people&#8217;s fundamental rights as well.&nbsp;<br><br>As you noted, the Senate will return in September.&nbsp; We will stay at it in this fight.&nbsp; We will continue to work with officials around the country, with activists, and with legislators to move legislation forward.&nbsp;<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just curious if the President is following the recall election in California, how concerned he is about the vote, and whether he has considered getting more involved to potentially engage Democratic voters that, polls show, are less enthusiastic about casting ballots.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t &#8212; I wouldn&#8217;t say he&#8217;s following it particularly closely, in the sense that he&#8217;s got a lot on his agenda.&nbsp; But we certainly support Governor Newsom and have worked with him on a range of key issues, whether it&#8217;s the pandemic, addressing wildfires, growing the economy, and look forward to continuing to do so.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But will we see the President potentially make a statement or, you know, some other show of support for him in the closing final days?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; He &#8212; he supports him.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have anything in terms of additional steps to preview for you.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, what is the White House reaction to the Hyde Amendment being included in the $3.5 trillion budget resolution?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m going to negotiate from here.&nbsp; The President&#8217;s position on Hyde is well known and we&#8217;ve stated many times publicly.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And let me follow up on that, please?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I think we&#8217;re going to move on.&nbsp;<br><br>Go ahead.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Cross-talk.)<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Go ahead, Joey.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Cross-talk.)<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Go ahead, Joey.&nbsp; Go ahead.&nbsp; I think we&#8217;re going to move on so we can get some more people.&nbsp; Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All right.&nbsp; Thanks &#8212;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Cross-talk.)<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; It doesn&#8217;t help to scream over people.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; I appreciate it.&nbsp; Just going back to the Senator Manchin statement.&nbsp; You said he, quote, &#8220;confounded a couple of things&#8221; when he raised cost concerns with the $3.5 trillion price tag.&nbsp; Does that mean, for now &#8212; and I know we&#8217;ve asked you about this a couple times &#8212; but your position, the White House position right now is that it needs to be the $3.5 trillion price tag and that you&#8217;re not budging on that figure and you&#8217;re digging in on that figure?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; That&#8217;s not what I was saying.&nbsp; I was responding to &#8212; although the President is certainly comfortable with that amount, he &#8212; his priorities are ensuring that the Build Back Better agenda; that additional investments in protecting our climate; making &#8212; bringing down the cost of childcare, of healthcare, of education for the American public is included.&nbsp; He&#8217;s spoken to that before.&nbsp; There&#8217;s going to be a negotiation, moving forward.<br><br>What I was speaking to is the fact that the Build Back Better agenda will actually bring costs down over the course of time.&nbsp; It&#8217;s also a plan and a proposal that is fully paid for.&nbsp; It is different from the American Rescue Plan emergency funding that was passed in order to address dual pandemics.&nbsp; So, I was just clarifying some of the specifics that were raised there.&nbsp;<br><br>Go ahead, Ebony.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tomorrow, Representative Norton, along with several other progressive groups, are going to be having a rally, but also delivering a petition with thousands of names to the President to ask him to come out and still speak on the filibuster.&nbsp;<br><br>And while we know what the President stance is, today, on the steps of the Supreme Court, you had family members of John Lewis talking about how the President has done so much on the filibuster &#8212; speaking more than 300 times, but less than 50 when it comes to voting rights.&nbsp;<br><br>Is there anything in his schedule where we can see where the President is going to be making the same type of effort he is doing with infrastructure on voting rights?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, the President gave &#8212; has given major speeches recently, in the last few weeks, on voting rights.&nbsp; He&#8217;s also said that it is a cause of his presidency, and he believes that voting rights are fundamental rights for the American people and the American public.&nbsp; His closest advisor and partner is &#8212; is, of course, Vice President Harris; she is leading this effort.&nbsp;<br><br>And he has taken steps that he has the purview to take, including signing an executive order to expand and protect voting rights, including ensuring and supporting steps for the Department of Justice to provide additional funding, including nominating voting rights &#8212; leaders in the voting rights community to play important roles in the Department of Justice.&nbsp;<br><br>He will continue to speak out on this issue.&nbsp; He will continue to advocate for fundamental rights.&nbsp; And he will look forward to signing legislation into law.<br><br>Go ahead.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.&nbsp; Given the uptick in &#8212; given the uptick in inflation, is anyone at the White House taking a closer look at the previous administration&#8217;s tariffs to see which ones actually serve, you know, geopolitical interests and then which ones just increase costs for consumer?&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, we&#8217;ve talked about how there&#8217;s ongoing reviews of tariffs and a range of steps that were put in place by the prior administration.&nbsp; And, of course, we&#8217;re going to continue to use every economic tool in our toolbox.&nbsp;<br><br>I would note &#8212; and I know noted this pri- &#8212; previously &#8212; but as we look at averages, the rate of inflation has actually come down, and we continue to be at a projection where it is going to come back to normal rates next year.&nbsp;<br><br>And we also know that there are specific industries that are impacting inflation.&nbsp; We also saw a &#8212; encouraging data as it relates to the used car industry.&nbsp; Last month, it went up by 10 percent.&nbsp; Now it went up &#8212; the cost, I should say &#8212; by less than 1 percent.&nbsp;<br><br>So, we&#8217;re seeing some encouraging data.&nbsp; And we want to, of course, see that trend continue.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then even though he&#8217;s now out of office, would this President support the New York legislature if they decided to impeach Governor Cuomo?&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; That&#8217;s a decision for them to make.&nbsp; The President made clear his views.&nbsp; Obviously, the former &#8212; the governor announced his steps yesterday.&nbsp; We&#8217;ll leave it at that.<br><br>Go ahead.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, you said at the top you&#8217;re hoping that the companies and universities the President is about to meet with will be a model for others.&nbsp; So, is the President’s official position that all companies in the private sector should have vaccine mandates for their employees?&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; The President&#8217;s position is that every company should take a look at how to protect their workforce and that there are going to be different carrots and sticks that can be used by different private sector entities.&nbsp; Even these industries that are represented today have taken different steps.&nbsp; He&#8217;s lifting up them as examples of models of what works.&nbsp; But there are different &#8212; different companies will take different approaches.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the President disappointed in other airlines that haven&#8217;t taken the steps that United has?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We&#8217;ve seen some other airlines &#8212; I know Delta announced that they would only be hiring people who were vaccinated.&nbsp; &nbsp;And we&#8217;ve seen different industries take different steps.&nbsp; But we are certainly encouraged by the step of United Airlines and by any steps by employers to protect their workforce.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And lastly, has the President spoken with the outgoing governor of New York?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; No.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; Just a follow-up on mask mandates.&nbsp; Yesterday, when President Biden was asked if he has the authority to intervene in states like Texas and Florida where they are banning mask mandates, he signaled that the administration is looking into it.&nbsp; Can you provide more clarity on what the President meant, any avenues that the administration is exploring to intervene in states?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; What he was speaking about &#8212; and I think he gave a little bit of context on this &#8212; was that we&#8217;re looking into ways we can help the leaders at the local level who are putting public health first continue to do their jobs, keep students safe, and keep students in school.&nbsp;<br><br>That&#8217;s something our Department of Education and others are looking at.&nbsp; I just don&#8217;t have anything to preview for you at this point in time.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And a follow-up on the debt ceiling: Does the President believe that he can unilaterally raise the debt limit through an executive order if it was under emergency circumstances?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; The President believes that Congress should act to raise the debt ceiling, as they have 80 times in the past.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Has he asked his lawyers if he could raise the debt limit unilaterally?&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; He believes Congress should and will act to do it.&nbsp; Go ahead.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; I wanted &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Oh, did we &#8212;&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Go ahead.&nbsp; And then we’ll go to you.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay, great.&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.&nbsp; Two questions.&nbsp; The Biden administration has already delivered 20 million vaccine doses to 26 countries in Africa from the pledge the President made on May 17th.&nbsp;<br><br>And Africa expects to receive a significant portion of doses from the pledge the President made at the G7 on June 10th.&nbsp;<br><br>But with only 1.7 percent of people vaccinated in Africa and the Delta variant killing so many people, is the President considering scaling up vaccine donation from the G7 pledge to African countries?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, the G7 made their commitment, which is significant and will be implemented.&nbsp; We are continue &#8212; going to continue to build on what we&#8217;ve already announced, so we plan to share tens of millions of doses across the summer months.<br><br>I&#8217;d also note that we&#8217;re also working to support vaccine manufacturing in Africa by providing a South African bus- &#8212; by providing financing to a South African business to bolster manufacturing capacity to produce more than 500 million doses.&nbsp;<br><br>So we are looking at a range of ways to provide supply, to be the arsenal of vaccines in the global community, including Africa, and we will continue to expedite that as quickly as we can.<br><br>We know that the &#8212; the pandemic knows no borders.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And on Guinea: Is the White House doing anything to support Guinea to contain the Marburg virus disease that was identified there?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Is it a strain of the coronavirus?<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No, it&#8217;s a strain of the &#8212; it is in the same family with the Ebola virus.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Ah.&nbsp; I will &#8212; I&#8217;m happy to check with our team and see if there&#8217;s any specific updates.&nbsp; The State Department might be the best entity to speak to that.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; A question about Africa.&nbsp; We have seen a number of deadly jihadist attacks in the last days in Mali and Burkina Faso.&nbsp; You just said the President&#8217;s assessment is that the terrorist threat is spreading in other countries.&nbsp; Is he planning to do anything about those countries in Africa?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I think what I was referring to is what the President conveyed in May when he gave a speech about his decision as it relates to U.S. troops in Afghanistan.&nbsp;<br><br>And certainly his assessment &#8212; not new assessment; this has been growing over time, as you know &#8212; that the threat has expanded to &#8212; over the last several years &#8212; to Northern Africa and other parts of the world.&nbsp;<br><br>So, certainly our counterterrorism strategy reflects that assessment, which, again, is not new, but certainly contributed to his decision on Afghanistan.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, a headline from the New York Post from, I believe, two days ago: Team Biden&#8217;s war on DeSantis is all about &#8220;kneecapping&#8221; a successful governor &#8212; a GOP governor.&nbsp; Could you address that concern, please?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Our war is not on DeSantis.&nbsp; It&#8217;s on the virus, which we&#8217;re trying to kneecap.&nbsp; And he does not seem to want to participate in that effort to kneecap the virus, hence our concern.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.&nbsp; I have a rapid fire, three questions on transparency.&nbsp; As Ed noted earlier, the President&#8217;s been to Delaware 17 times &#8212; it’s soon going to be 18 and 19 times &#8212; over the past six months.&nbsp; I want to know how visits from visitors and from family members with potential conflicts of interest are being treated for the purposes of White House visitor log disclosure.&nbsp;<br><br>Also, I was hoping that you could respond to Walter Shaub&#8217;s criticism of the First Son&#8217;s art sales.&nbsp; He says he wants to &#8212; &#8220;shame on the President if he doesn&#8217;t ask his son to stop.”&nbsp; What exactly has the President said to his son?<br><br>And the third question is: What spacing constraints are there in the White House East Room that are preventing us all from attending the event later today, especially considering there are no spacing constraints in this room?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, one, I think we wanted to make it as transparent as possible and make the entire meeting available to everyone who isn&#8217;t just in this room, so we are actually not discriminating against people who are covering the White House from outside of the White House briefing room.<br><br>Second, I would say, we &#8212; we have spoken extensively to the arrangements, which are not White House arrangements; they&#8217;re arrangements between Hunter Biden&#8217;s representatives and ones that we, certainly, were made aware of.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t think I have anything to add in that regard.<br><br>And no, I can confirm we are not going to be providing information about the comings and goings of the President&#8217;s grandchildren or people visiting him in Delaware.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the reconciliation &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Last one.&nbsp; Thank you, Darlene.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the reconciliation framework there was &#8212; that made the next step here &#8212; the public debt, it says, goes to $30.7 trillion in the next fiscal year, then it balloons to $45.1 trillion by 2031, and that&#8217;s with the payfors.&nbsp; So, at what point does the federal debt become an issue or concern for the President?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, it was a concern when he came in, and he was left with quite a debt and deficit by his predecessor.&nbsp; But the President has proposed a plan and package that would be fully paid for by asking corporations and the wealthiest Americans to pay a little bit more to make our country more competitive, and he feels quite comfortable with the fiscal responsibility of that.<br><br>Thanks, everyone, so much.&nbsp; Have a great day.<br><br>1:16 P.M. EDT</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>New Report from the Council of Economic Advisers and Office of Management and Budget</em></p>



<p>Over the last three decades, American families have experienced a rise in the costs of many necessities that has made it difficult for them to attain economic security. While prices of some services and goods have fallen substantially over this period, especially when bearing in mind increases in their quality, several others—particularly health care, prescription drugs, childcare, and education—have risen substantially, and in many cases, faster than incomes. Rising income inequality and the fact that low- and middle-income-families spend a higher share of their budgets on necessities mean that low- and middle-income families are more exposed to these cost increases.</p>



<p>Through the&nbsp;Build Back Better economic agenda, the Biden Administration has proposed critical investments to address these long-standing cost pressures. Families with young children will benefit most from the proposed expansion of the Child Tax Credit, universal preschool, and improvements in the quality of childcare and a reduction in associated out-of-pocket costs. Proposals to lower prescription drug cost through Medicare-negotiated prices, add dental and vision benefits to Medicare, and expand access to home- and community-based care through Medicaid will especially benefit households with elderly members. Combined, these policy proposals, and others put forward by the President, will help ensure that families can meet costs and share in a broad prosperity.</p>

<p>Today, President Biden virtually met with four business, university and health care leaders who have adopted COVID-19 vaccination requirements for their workforces. The President expressed his appreciation for these leaders stepping up to protect the lives of their employees and communities.
