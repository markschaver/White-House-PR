<p class="has-text-align-center">James S. Brady Press Briefing Room</p>



<p>1:11 P.M. EDT</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Hi, everyone.&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Just a couple of items for all of you at the top.&nbsp; We tried to wait until after the backgrounder on the India bilat as well, so hopefully you were able to listen in on that.<br><br>Today, as part of the fight to help Americans deal with high costs, the Vice President is announcing new actions to protect consumers and lessen the burden of medical debt on American families.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>She’ll be joined by administration leaders, including HHS Secretary Becerra, CFPB Director Chopra, and OMB Director Young.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Medical debt is now the largest source of debt in collections &#8212; more than credit cards, utilities, and auto loans combined.&nbsp; But it is not just a financial issue; it can have negative health effects too.&nbsp; Studies have found that Americans with medical debt are more likely to avoid seeking additional medical care than those without debt.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Getting sick or taking care of loved ones should not mean financial hardship for American families.&nbsp; That is why the administration is going to hold medical providers and debt collectors accountable for harmful practices, reduce the role that medical debt plays in determining whether Americans can access credit, help over half a million of low-income American veterans get their medical debt forgiven, and inform consumers of their rights.</p>



<p>These actions come on the heels of the President’s April 5th executive order on access to affordable, quality healthcare coverage. </p>



<p>I also wanted to note that, today, our administration launched a rural infrastructure tour to double down on the President’s unwavering commitment to building a better America where rural communities thrive.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>The White House released a Rural Playbook to help state, local, Tribal, and territorial governments in rural areas unlock the historic investments from the President’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.</p>



<p>This playbook offers a “what, when, where, and how” to apply for funding under the law, making it easier for rural communities to plan and compete for federal resources that create good-paying jobs and generate economic opportunities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Secretary Haaland is kicking off the tour in Boulder County, Colorado, today.&nbsp; And during the month of April, Cabinet members and Biden administration officials will travel to dozens of rural communities to talk about how we are unlocking Bipartisan Infrastructure Law investments and federal resources to make sure they reach rural areas across America.</p>



<p>This tour includes the President’s trip tomorrow to Menlo, Iowa, outside of Des Moines, to discuss our &#8212; the administration’s actions to lower costs for working families.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>There, President Biden will make an announcement on actions to reduce the impact of Putin’s price hike and build America &#8212; a better America with investments in rural communities from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.<br><br>And welcome back, Karine &#8212; her first day back.&nbsp; We’re very thrilled to have her back here with us in the Briefing Room.<br><br>Okay.&nbsp; With that &#8212;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I’ve got three things, hopefully &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; pretty quickly.&nbsp; You just mentioned the President is going to Iowa as part of the Rural Playbook launch.&nbsp; He&#8217;s visiting a state that he lost during the 2020 campaign, and he&#8217;s going to a county that was even more voting Republican last time.&nbsp; I&#8217;m wondering if that will make it harder to &#8212; for that area to receive his message politically.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I think the President is not making this trip through a political prism.&nbsp; He&#8217;s making this trip because Iowa is a rural state in the country that would benefit greatly from the President&#8217;s policies, including the policies that he&#8217;ll be talking about tomorrow on his trip.<br><br>When he was running, I think many of you heard him say and convey he wanted to be the President for all people, whether you voted for him or not.&nbsp; And this is certainly an example of his effort to do exactly that.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On another topic &#8212; looking at the bilateral.&nbsp; How much did the President push the Prime Minister to limit Russian energy imports and arms?&nbsp; And what was the response?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, we&#8217;ll let the Indian government project their response &#8212; or not their response, but their readout of the call.<br><br>I would say that energy imports are not banned.&nbsp; They don&#8217;t violate our sanctions.&nbsp; We certainly recognize every country is going to take steps that are in their interest.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>At the same time, on this call, what the President did is consistent with what our Deputy National Security Advisor, of course, did during his visit just a few weeks ago &#8212; was to make clear what the impact, of course, of our sanctions would be.&nbsp; We expect everybody to abide by those.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>And while India is &#8212; only imports about 1 to 2 percent of its energy from Russia, we also made clear and the President made clear that we would be happy to help them in diversifying this as well.<br><br>In terms of &#8212; and we also made clear, I should say, that &#8212; the President also made clear that he does not believe it&#8217;s in India&#8217;s interest to accelerate or increase imports of Russian energy and other commodities as well, which is something we certainly convey to other countries.<br><br>In terms of military &#8212; military actions: So we have not made a decision about the waiver under CAATSA.&nbsp; In terms of how much it was discussed during the call, I&#8217;d have to get more details from our national security team on that specifically.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; On the new rule today, this is already facing the threat of legal challenges &#8212; challenges from some gun groups.&nbsp; Given those threats, are you bracing for legal challenge?&nbsp; And when do you realistically expect to see this new rule take effect, given those challenges?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, let me first say that this rule &#8212; or the intention to put this rule forward was announced, as you know, some time ago.&nbsp; And there was a lot of response to it &#8212; 250,000 comments &#8212; which is, of course, a lot to go through.<br><br>What this is a reflection of and why the President is, of course, confident or hopeful about our ability to ensure we can continue to implement it is the fact that ghost guns kill people too. &nbsp;Ghost guns can be purchased online.&nbsp; People put together these kits.&nbsp; There are not background checks that are required.&nbsp;&nbsp; They&#8217;re not under the same &#8212; they&#8217;re not, also, required to &#8212; to have serial numbers, which makes it more difficult for law enforcement to track when these have an impact in crimes.<br><br>So, of course, the President is confident in any executive order and the legal authority that he puts forward.&nbsp; But what&#8217;s important to note about the announcement he is making today is that this is &#8212; this is a rule that is supported by law enforcement; it is a rule that will help address what we know is a rising component of gun crimes across the country, which is the use of ghost guns.&nbsp; And to the President, it was important to take a step to address that.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Going off of what you just said, police tell us that these guns are as simple as clicking on the Internet and snapping parts together.&nbsp; Will there be &#8212; can you say, this administration say there will be fewer shootings as a result of what the President is doing today?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, that&#8217;s always our hope and our objective &#8212; right? &#8212; is to reduce the impact of gun violence.&nbsp; As we&#8217;ve seen violence go up, we have seen a huge, vast majority of that &#8212; nearly three quarters &#8212; as a result of guns.&nbsp; And ghost guns, as you said, Cecilia, are used by simply clicking and ordering online &#8212; ordering a kit that people can make in their homes.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>And that is one of the reasons why this action or efforts to take more steps has been supported by a range of law enforcement officials from &#8212; the International Association of Chiefs of Police said that ghost guns are, quote, “increasingly used by criminals and terrorists.”&nbsp; We saw Governor Larry Hogan &#8212; of course, a Republican, as you know &#8212; call Maryland&#8217;s ban &#8212; a bill banning ghost guns a, quote, “positive step as we seek to stem the tide of violent crime.”&nbsp; Brown County, Wisconsin Lieutenant Matt Ra- &#8212; Matt Ronk said ghost guns are, quote, “a new threat.”&nbsp;<br><br>And there are a range of police leaders and officials across the country who have conveyed how important bo- &#8212; these components that the President is announcing today are to addressing the threat of ghost guns.</p>



<p><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey, Jen.&nbsp; Just to follow up: Did the President get a commitment from Prime Minister Modi not to accelerate or increase imports of Russian energy?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I&#8217;ll let Prime Minister Modi and the Indians speak to that.&nbsp; Again, it’s 1 to 2 percent at this point in time.&nbsp; It is not &#8212; they import 10 percent from the United States.&nbsp; It is not a violation of any sanctions or anything along those lines.&nbsp; It was a constructive, direct conversation.&nbsp; But I will let them speak for themselves.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And secondly, the President said he wanted to meet Prime Minister Modi in Tokyo on or about May 24th.&nbsp; What else can you tell us about this trip?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; The President is looking forward to going to Asia at some point, but I don&#8217;t have any more details at this point in time.&nbsp; Clearly, he&#8217;s excited since he talked about it today.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clearly.&nbsp; And lastly, any details about this announcement tomorrow in Iowa?&nbsp; Is it related to ethanol?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have any more details at this point in time.&nbsp; As you all know, we are taking a range of steps to reduce the price of gas to move us toward a long-term, more clean energy economy, but I expect we&#8217;ll have more of a preview for you later today.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; Back to the conversation with Modi &#8212; did the President urge Modi to speak out more forcefully against the Russian invasion?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, we have seen the Indians do exactly that more recently, as they did as it relates to the horrific photos that we saw around Bucha.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve seen them take steps to provide humanitarian assistance and a range of assistance.&nbsp; But it is something we always encourage leaders to do: to speak out, to be vocal to ensure they’re on the right side of history.<br><br>But this was a constructive call.&nbsp; It was a productive call.&nbsp; It was &#8212; it&#8217;s a relationship that is vitally important to the United States and to the President.&nbsp; I would not see it as an adversarial call.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, I understand you want to let the Indians speak for themselves, but was the President seeking a promise from Modi that he wouldn&#8217;t look to increase oil purchases from Russia?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, we are &#8212; the President both conveyed that we are here to help them diversify their means of importing oil.&nbsp; Again, our &#8212; the imports from the United States are already significant &#8212; or much bigger than the imports that they get from Russia.&nbsp; And we, of course &#8212; the President conveyed very clearly that it is not in their interest to increase that.</p>



<p>But beyond that, I would let the Indian leaders speak for themselves.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Oh, go ahead.&nbsp; Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, finally, I&#8217;m wondering if &#8212; you know, last night, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, told “60 Minutes” that the Ukrainian military has recordings of conversations between Russian troops, talking about committing atrocities that would qualify as war crimes.&nbsp; I’m wondering if anyone in the U.S. government has been able to listen to these intercepts or whether the U.S. government has similar intercepts.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I don&#8217;t have anything to confirm on that front from here.&nbsp; But what I would reiterate is something Jake Sullivan said last week, which is that, as we&#8217;re looking to provide data and information to war crimes investigations &#8212; of which there are a range of options currently underway: the OSCE, obviously the ICC, the Ukrainian Special Prosecutor is also gathering information &#8212; we&#8217;re going to provide any data and information we can, and we&#8217;re going to encourage other countries to do exactly that.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve already called a range of these action we&#8217;ve seen “war crimes.”&nbsp; That is important, but there&#8217;s also going to be an investigative step where all of this will be &#8212; will be fed into.&nbsp; That can also take some time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If this ended up at The Hague, is that something that the White House would support?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We&#8217;re not going to prejudge which format or forum that it can take.&nbsp; There are a range of different options that history has utilized, whether it&#8217;s I- &#8212; the ICC or the OSCE.&nbsp; And basically, an international fora is probably the appropriate forum, but we&#8217;re not going to predetermine what that looks like.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.&nbsp; Does the U.S. intend to return its diplomatic presence to Kyiv?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; That is, of course, our objective over the course of time, but we&#8217;re going to have to assess when it&#8217;s the right time to do exactly that.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it considering moving back into Ukraine, potentially to Lviv, sooner rather than later?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have a prediction of that at this point.&nbsp; Obviously, we &#8212; it&#8217;s in our interest to have a diplomatic presence on the ground.&nbsp; But that is an assessment made by the State Department, made through the prism of security considerations.&nbsp; And sometimes it&#8217;s a smaller presence that gets larger, but they are really the appropriate entity to speak to that.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there any concern that if the U.S. does not get its diplomatic presence back sooner, that it&#8217;ll appear that we&#8217;re leading from behind, as you&#8217;ve got the European Union, I believe the Czech Republic, Italy &#8212; a lot of countries are coming forward and saying that they&#8217;re going back to Ukraine, and the U.S. hasn&#8217;t done it yet.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I would say that the most important thing the United States has done and continues to do is lead the entire global coalition in standing up against Russia; and ensuring we are providing military, security assistance, expediting that, tapping into not only our own resources but the resources of countries around the world; and leading the world in a package of economic sanctions that has had a crippling impact on the Russian economy.&nbsp; Those are the most important factors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Has the President asked to go to Ukraine?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I&#8217;m not going to get into private conversations.&nbsp; What I will tell you is we&#8217;re not currently planning a trip by the President of the United States to Ukraine.&nbsp; What is most important to the Ukrainian leadership is that we are expediting weapons and getting them the assistance and security systems they need.&nbsp; And that is what our focus is on.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And who decides if the President goes to Ukraine or not?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; In what way?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He had said, when he was in Poland, that he expressed interest in going to Ukraine, but “they wouldn&#8217;t let me.”&nbsp; So I’m wondering who advises that.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I&#8217;m not going to get into private considerations internally on that front.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; And then, on Title 42, you said over the weekend that the administration agrees more needs to be done; the immigration system is broken.&nbsp; This was in response to a question about &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; Democrats who don&#8217;t want to lift it right now.&nbsp; You invited Republicans to work with the White House to get something done on immigration, but has the White House actually reached out to any Republicans to try to move this forward recently?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; It has been a longstanding open invitation.&nbsp; Any Republican who wants to work with us on immigration reform, you&#8217;re invited; let&#8217;s have a conversation.&nbsp; We have not seen an expression of that interest across the board.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So you&#8217;re wanting Republicans to go to you.&nbsp; The White House is not reaching out, then, any (inaudible)?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We have conversations with Democrats and Republicans all the time, Jacqui.&nbsp; But I think it&#8217;s clear what we&#8217;re seeing from Republicans is an effort to politicize this and not fix what we all recognize is an outdated and broken system.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And one last question.&nbsp; You said on Friday that the Vice President was masked indoors all day, but the White House tweeted a video showing her standing over the President without a mask on.&nbsp; Can you explain what happened there?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would say that the Vice President and the President and all of us abide by what the CDC protocols are.&nbsp; It was an emotional day.&nbsp; It was a historic day.&nbsp; And there were moments when she was not wearing a mask inside, including in a photo.&nbsp; But she was wearing it 99.9 percent of the time.</p>



<p>I would note the President and the Vice President have both tested negative in the last 24 hours.&nbsp; And, you know, we have felt and made the decision it&#8217;s important for &#8212; to share it with all of you when there are close contacts; that&#8217;s exactly what we did.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Why it&#8217;s of interest to the public, I think, is &#8212; and you guys can agree or disagree with me &#8212; is because the four principals &#8212; the public has a right to know and an interest in knowing when the four principals have &#8212; have exposure or close-contact exposure to any individuals who have COVID.</p>



<p>The Vice President is now post- &#8212; five days post-exposure.&nbsp; She tested negative.</p>



<p>Oh, go ahead.&nbsp; You &#8212; oh, sorry.&nbsp; I’ll go to Kaitlan.&nbsp; Go ahead.&nbsp; Go ahead, sorry.&nbsp; I jumped around.&nbsp; I didn’t mean to.&nbsp; I &#8212; go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speaking of India&#8217;s response to Russia&#8217;s invasion, they have abstained from several votes at the United Nations, condemning the invasion, suspending Russia from the Human Rights Council.&nbsp; Did President Biden raise that during their call today?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have any more details beyond what was raised or briefed out in the background call.&nbsp; Obviously, the call concluded.&nbsp;&nbsp; We just did a briefing call.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have any more details beyond that.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So you can&#8217;t say if President Biden asked them to condemn the invasion?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; They have condemned the recent horrific atrocities we saw in Bucha.&nbsp; And certainly, as we see more, we expect them to do exactly that as well.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What does the U.S. assess this new Russian general overseeing the invasion will mean for it going forward?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would say our view is that even a changeover in personnel or leadership at the top is not going to erase the fact that this is a strategic failure for Russia.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What we should all be aware of, and we are certainly aware of, is this is a general who was already responsible for overseeing atrocities in Syria, and that we would expect that it would be a continuation of the type of atrocities we&#8217;ve already seen take place in Ukraine.</p>



<p>But again, they have not &#8212; it has not gone as President Putin has planned, and we don&#8217;t expect a change in personnel would change that.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are you concerned it could get worse?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I think, Kaitlan, separate from any change of leadership at the top, what we have seen or we expect is: As they have coalesced their sort &#8212; their resources and their &#8212; you know, all of the resources that they have into eastern &#8212; most of them, I should say &#8212; into eastern Ukraine, we certainly expect that they will seek to surround and overwhelm Ukrainian forces in that part of the country; we expect Russia will continue to launch air and missile strikes across the rest of the country to cause military and economic damage; and we expect this stage of the conflict could last a long time.</p>



<p>And we should have no illusions that Russia is going to adjust their tactics and make them less brutal.&nbsp; And certainly, changes in leadership reflect a continuation of the type of atrocities we&#8217;ve seen or the type of approach that we&#8217;ve seen and we&#8217;ve also predicted from the beginning.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And just to follow on Jacqui’s question, what is the threshold for reopening the U.S. embassy in Kyiv?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;I’d point you to the State Department if they have any more specifics they want to outline publicly.</p>



<p>Obviously, we want to have a diplomatic re- &#8212; presence on the ground; that&#8217;s always going to be our objective.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead.&nbsp; Oh, Kelly, go ahead.&nbsp; Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It’s been years since there&#8217;s been a confirmed ATF director.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And what do you think will be different now with this new nomination the President is putting forward?&nbsp; And do you think the absence of that kind of leadership has had any part in the increase in gun violence the country has seen?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I &#8212; it&#8217;s hard for &#8212; it&#8217;s hard for me to make a conclusion or us to make a conclusion on that from here.</p>



<p>But what I &#8212; what we know is that having confirmed leadership leading any agency, including one as important as the ATF, always is going to make the systems, the processes, the ability to get policymaking done more efficient and effective.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And there&#8217;s no question it&#8217;s a net positive to have someone confirmed to lead ATF.</p>



<p>I would say that, you know, Steve, who is our nominee &#8212; or announced nominee &#8212; is a highly qualified candidate with decades of law enforcement experience, including through partnerships with the ATF, to prosecute complex cases and take down violent criminal gangs.&nbsp; He&#8217;s received bipartisan support from law enforcement leaders.&nbsp; He was confirmed unanimously when he was nominated to serve as a federal prosecutor.</p>



<p>And our view is that if Republicans are about getting tough on crime, as we are, and keeping our communities safe, they should support a career prosecutor like Steve Dettelbach, who can make ATF more effective in getting guns off our streets and stopping criminals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And it&#8217;s in all of our interest to have a confirmed nominee, and we think he is eminently qualified to do exactly that.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And just to follow on the issue of the Vice President and the masking: A couple of times, you&#8217;ve cited “emotional day,” “important day,” “important role” she was playing.&nbsp; You&#8217;re not saying that those things are reasons to not follow CDC guidance?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Absolutely not.&nbsp; And I appreciate your question on that.&nbsp; What I was conveying is that, you know, while she has worn a mask &#8212; as is protocol and as is our expectation of everyone from the Vice President, the President, all of us on down if you have a close contact &#8212; that there was a photo, as Jacqui said, and there &#8212; there are moments when she was human and she didn&#8217;t have a pho- &#8212; mask on in a photo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But she has worn the mask.&nbsp; And certainly, that is what we want to convey to the American people.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it because of the photo?&nbsp; Because it&#8217;s an important day and the photo will live for decades that &#8212; we all understand &#8212; I mean, I&#8217;m wearing a mask today; I don&#8217;t always wear a mask.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is that the reason?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I think it was a decision made in the moment.&nbsp; But it doesn&#8217;t mean that we don&#8217;t all try to be model citizens here and abide by what the CDC protocols are on requirements.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I conveyed and wanted to reiterate that she did test negative, in case those of you had not seen that, because she now is at that five-day past the close contact.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, thank you.&nbsp; Pakistan’s Prime Minister, Imran Khan, was deposed this weekend following the no-confidence vote in Parliament.&nbsp; What is the administration’s reaction to those developments?&nbsp; And does President Biden have any plans to speak with the country&#8217;s new Prime Minister, Shehbaz Sharif?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; So, we support the peaceful upholding of constitutional and democratic principles.&nbsp; We don’t support one political party over another.&nbsp; And we certainly support the principles of rule of law and equal justice under the law.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We value our longstanding cooperation with Pakistan, have always viewed a prosperous and democratic Pakistan as critical to U.S. interests.&nbsp; That remains unchanged regardless of who leadership is.</p>



<p>In terms of a future call, I don’t have anything to predict at this point in time.&nbsp; Obviously, we stay in close touch with them at a range of levels.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then one more question on the President&#8217;s call with Prime Minister Modi.&nbsp; Was India&#8217;s acquisition of the S-400 missile defense system from Russia a topic of discussion?&nbsp; And do you have any updates on whether the U.S. would impose sanctions that would be triggered under CAATSA or issue a waiver should India go through with that purchase?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah, I &#8212; I don&#8217;t have an update.&nbsp; As I said, kind of, to an earlier question on the CAATSA waiver that would be required, I don&#8217;t have an update at this point in time.&nbsp; I can see if there&#8217;s more to report out to you before the end of the day.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tomorrow is CPI day.&nbsp; It’s probably, obviously, going to capture the start of the war and pretty significant spikes in energy.&nbsp; Can you give us a sense of what you&#8217;re expecting and what, if any, change this will make for what talks may or may not be going on with the Hill on what pieces may or may not be passed of a bill that may or may not have a name?&nbsp; I don’t know (inaudible).</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sounds very hypothetical and hopeful.&nbsp; Okay.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How high do you &#8212; how high do you expect these numbers to be?&nbsp; And &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure, and &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; is there any impact on the strategy to pass what you believe to be &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; inflation-cooling measures &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yes &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; in the medium term?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; &#8212; I understand your question.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, because of the actions we&#8217;ve taken to address Putin &#8212; the Putin price hike, we are in a better place than we were last month.&nbsp; But we expect March CPA &#8212; CPI headline inflation to be extraordinarily elevated due to Putin&#8217;s price hike.&nbsp; And we expect a large difference between core and headline inflation, reflecting the global disruptions in energy and food markets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A core infla- &#8212; inflation doesn&#8217;t include energy and food prices; headline inflation does.&nbsp; And, of course, we know that core inflation, you know, energy &#8212; the impact of energy, of course, on oil prices, gas prices, we expect that to continue to reflect what we&#8217;ve seen the increases be over the course of this invasion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And just as an example: Since President Putin&#8217;s military buildup accelerated in January, average gas prices are up more than 80 cents, most of the increase occurred in the month of March.&nbsp; And at times, gas prices were more than a dollar above pre-invasion level.&nbsp; So, that roughly 25 percent increase in gas prices will drive tomorrow&#8217;s inflation reading.&nbsp; And certainly, it&#8217;s not a surprise to us, but we certainly think it will be reflected.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And in March, again, to give you a point of comparison, the average cost of a barrel of oil was around $110.&nbsp; That&#8217;s compared to about $75 at the beginning of the year.&nbsp; So, we expect this to all be reflected as we look at the data tomorrow.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I will say that anytime there is heightened monthly data or inflation reporting or numbers, it is a reminder to us, to our allies on the Hill, and hopefully to many of the American people that we need to do more to reduce costs for the American people.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have, of course, legislation that could do exactly that: cut the costs of childcare, of healthcare, of eldercare.&nbsp; These all have enormous impacts on people&#8217;s budgets; on when they&#8217;re, you know, doing those calculations at their kitchen table.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>And &#8212; and certainly this data will be a reminder of the need to do something and take additional steps.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, Jen, so he &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; the President signed the PNTR bill on Friday.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yes.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you have anything to share on next steps for that?&nbsp; In other words, how quickly would tariffs on Russian goods change across the (inaudible)?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah, that&#8217;s a great question.&nbsp; Let me see if I can get to a more &#8212; how quickly it would be implemented &#8212; you know, when they would see the tariffs is you&#8217;re asking?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah, correct.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And finally, the announcement this afternoon on guns.&nbsp; Of course, the backdrop to this is a lot of cities are seeing significant instances of gun crime &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; or, sort of, violent crime more generally.&nbsp; Can you give us an update of where the administration stands on a push for a police reform package to pass through Congress?&nbsp; Are those talks ongoing at all or is the calculus that the, sort of, escalation in crime has made it even more difficult to pass a police reform package right now?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would say, first, on gun violence &#8212; which we do recognize as an enormous problem and, of course, a driver of what we&#8217;ve seen as the rising &#8212; rising rates of crime across the country for some time &#8212; you know, we are going to continue to call on Congress to do more.&nbsp; We&#8217;re not going to wait while lives are being lost and when more reforms need to be put in place.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, yeah, I mean, I think there&#8217;s, like, kind of two components here.&nbsp; There&#8217;s obviously police reform.&nbsp; There were bipartisan conversations.&nbsp; We sort of paused on our review of an executive order for that period of time out of respect for that process.&nbsp; Obviously, that&#8217;s not a process that is rapidly moving forward.&nbsp; We&#8217;re continuing to review and have every intention of the President signing an executive order on police reform.</p>



<p>I would note that we&#8217;ve also taken steps from the Department of Justice to ban chokeholds and take other steps that we have the capacity to do from the federal government.&nbsp; But in order to make reforms impactful over the long term and more expansive, we need legislation.</p>



<p>On guns, you know, we have also taken steps.&nbsp; The President has done more to fight gun violence and keep our communities safe than any President in history in his first year in office.&nbsp; This is obviously an issue that is close to his heart, something he&#8217;s passionate about and has been for decades.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And choking off the supply of guns being used in crimes, including by cracking down on gun traffickers and firearms dealers who are selling guns illegally, is one of the steps we&#8217;ve taken.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But also, we&#8217;ve taken steps to put more cops on the beat, investing in proven community-based programs to make our streets safer.&nbsp; Doing all of this to prop up, while also supporting reforms, local police &#8212; make sure they have the funding they need, while also putting in place, in whatever capacity we have, gun reform measures, as the President is doing today, to help address some of the rising impacts like ghost guns.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, but is it your assessment that, right now, there&#8217;s no appetite in Congress to pass the George Floyd policing bill?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I &#8212; I don&#8217;t want to speak for Congress.&nbsp; And so, they can speak for that and what they think the potential is.&nbsp; And obviously, we&#8217;re going to continue to advocate for that, to push for that, to press for that.&nbsp; But we&#8217;re not going to wait to take additional steps that we have the executive authority to take.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, if I can circle back to the call that the President had earlier today with the prime minister of India.&nbsp; A senior administration official did brief us earlier today and said that “We haven&#8217;t asked India to do anything in particular.”&nbsp; This was on energy imports.&nbsp; But then later said, “We don&#8217;t think&nbsp;<s>Russia</s>&nbsp;[India] should accelerate imports from Russian oil.”&nbsp; So can you tell us, did the President explicitly ask not for an acceleration of Russian oil?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; It&#8217;s more, as it was articulated &#8212; and I just articulated it, I hope &#8212; maybe not clearly &#8212; about conveying that we don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s in their interest to import more Russian oil.&nbsp; They&#8217;re only importing 1 to 2 percent at this point in time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We&#8217;re here to diversify and help them diversify, as we&#8217;ve done with other European countries, should they make that choice to do.</p>



<p>They&#8217;re not violating any sanctions by importing oil.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a decision we made from the United States, but we also recognize different countries have their own calculations.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But it was not an explicit ask?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; It was conveying exactly the &#8212; how I just described it.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Can I ask you one other question on inflation?&nbsp; You were referring, just a minute ago, to the consequences of Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine and Vladimir Putin.&nbsp; I know we’ve often heard the administration refer to “Putin’s price hike.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I just got back &#8212; actually, last week, I was out in Michigan talking to a lot of voters who told me that they feel like the inflation has predated the war.&nbsp; And I&#8217;m curious how the administration just, you know, split &#8212; squares this all together.&nbsp; I mean, many voters do feel that inflation, correctly so, predates the war and it can&#8217;t all be blamed on Vladimir Putin.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We&#8217;ve never &#8212; we talked about inflation long before there was an invasion.&nbsp; But we also know that factually, if you look at the data, the average gas prices are up $1, 80 cents &#8212; 80 cents to $1.&nbsp; It&#8217;s about a 25 percent, we&#8217;ve seen, increase in gas prices since the start of this invasion.&nbsp; And we know energy prices is a big driver of the inflation data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, that&#8217;s if you look at the economic data.&nbsp; It doesn&#8217;t mean &#8212; I&#8217;m not suggesting every person in this country looks at data and assesses in that way.&nbsp; They assess how they feel and what the impacts are on them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve long talked about, since at least I started this job since the President came into office, the impacts of the pandemic on supply chains, how that&#8217;s impacted a range of costs, and steps we&#8217;re taking to address those, whether it&#8217;s ensuring there’s &#8212; are goods moving through ports or other steps we can take to ensure there are &#8212; we fund chips manufacturing, because autos and the production of autos &#8212; and maybe this was a case or an issue when you were in Michigan &#8212; is def- &#8212; has definitely been a driver over the case [sic] of time.&nbsp; So they&#8217;re &#8212; the course of time.</p>



<p>So there&#8217;s a lot of different issues.&nbsp; But we have &#8212; there&#8217;s no question that energy prices continue to be, month by month, a driver of inflationary data.&nbsp; And we know that since the start of this invasion, because of the reduction of oil and the supply in the global oil market, that that &#8212; from Putin&#8217;s invasion &#8212; that that is a big driver.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, thanks so much.&nbsp; Just, sort of, circling back to Kelly&#8217;s question &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; about a new ATF nominee: Have &#8212; can you describe any outreach that&#8217;s been done to the Senate to ensure that the confirmation process goes more smoothly than it did to the last, sort of, selection?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, because we&#8217;re just announcing him today, I would expect it would be from here forward, right?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Obviously, there are notifications that happen in advance of any announcement, but certainly we feel that he is somebody who has been supported from a bi- &#8212; had bipartisan support in the past, is broadly supported by a number of &#8212; of police groups, and that he&#8217;s an excellent candidate to lead &#8212; to lead ATF.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But I wouldn&#8217;t validate a process going awry.&nbsp; I think it&#8217;s more about whether or not Republicans in Congress feel that there should be a head of the ATF.&nbsp; And we believe there should be, and this is a person who is eminently qualified to do that.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did the notification process include Senator Manchin’s office?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I&#8217;m not going to get into specifics of the notification process.&nbsp; But obviously, since he&#8217;s just making this announcement today, I would expect that the outreach picks up from here.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; And then, just on the &#8212; the President was photographed over the weekend in Washington, D.C., wearing a mask.&nbsp; I just wanted to &#8212; if you could go through when he masks and when he doesn&#8217;t.&nbsp; It would appear that he did not have a close contact, but correct me if that&#8217;s wrong.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; He did not, but we all make decisions.&nbsp; Some people in here are wearing masks to &#8212; wear masks to make them more comfortable, or because they chose to that day, or maybe they&#8217;re going to be around family members or people who may be immunocompromised or vulnerable.&nbsp; And the President makes that decision, as we all do as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, could I just ask a &#8212; kind of a broader question related to the Modi meeting?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You&#8217;ve talked a lot about the President&#8217;s leadership in terms of assembling a global coalition against Russia.&nbsp; But that global coalition isn&#8217;t really global, in the sense that there are many countries out there &#8212; India is one of them &#8212; that hasn&#8217;t really joined, hasn&#8217;t really taken a side.&nbsp; They’ve sort of adopted a neutral stance &#8212; as Kaitlan mentioned, the votes in the U.N., including the most recent one on kicking Russia out of the U.N. Human Rights Council.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, is Ru- &#8212; I mean, do you &#8212; do you all consider India an example of a kind of failure to broaden the coalition to countries like India beyond the sort of core European countries?</p>



<p>And if so, what &#8212; you know, was this call used or just does the President see pressure to use a call like this to expand that global coalition even further so that Russia doesn&#8217;t have the kind of lifelines that it &#8212; that it needs to escape &#8212; to escape the sanctions and the like?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would say building more than 50 percent &#8212; far more than 50 percent of the world&#8217;s GDP into a global coalition is hardly a failure.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t think anyone would call that a failure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But what India has done to date &#8212; and our objective and part of the objective of a phone call like this is to have a diplomatic conversation to build on this &#8212; right? &#8212; recognizing that countries go at different paces and &#8212; taking steps to support countries like Ukraine.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>What &#8212; what India has done to date is they have condemned the killings of civilians in Bucha.&nbsp; They have supported, they&#8217;ve called &#8212; they&#8217;ve supported calls for an independent investigation.&nbsp; They&#8217;ve provided over 90 tons of humanitarian relief material to Ukraine and its neighbors to include medicine and other essential relief.&nbsp; Earlier in the conflict, they also used its resources to evacuate almost 150 foreign nationals for 18 different countries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, part of our objectives now is to build on that and to encourage them to do more.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s important to have leader-to-leader conversations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The mask mandate for public transportation like trains, buses, and airplanes &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; expires next week.&nbsp; Does the White House or the administration have any plans on extending that?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, it&#8217;s a decision made by the CDC, so they will make that decision.&nbsp; And I&#8217;m not aware of a decision being made at this point, but I would certainly point you to them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I’d like to switch gears here.&nbsp; Do you have an update on Brittney Griner?&nbsp; Russian state media reporting that her detention has been extended at least until May 19th.&nbsp; And also, is it still a strategy not to talk about her here or limit talk about her case to keep from politicizing it?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; So, the State Department will have the most up-to-date information.&nbsp; I think it&#8217;s been out for some time &#8212; the extension of her detention there.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We typically don&#8217;t talk about cases in advance of having a Privacy Act waiver.&nbsp; Once we had a Privacy Act waiver, we can talk about it more.</p>



<p>But historically &#8212; and having formerly served at the State Department &#8212; it is not typically constructive to talk a great deal about these cases of individuals who are detained; it can, historically, impact our ability to bring them home.&nbsp; And that, of course, is our objective.</p>



<p>But the State Department makes those determinations.&nbsp; They are in closest touch with efforts to bring her home, and that certainly is our objective.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I have to ask: Trevor Reed or Paul Whelan?</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Again, you know, these are of course individuals &#8212; and we want to do everything we can and we are doing everything we can to bring them home, including raising their cases at every opportunity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But typically, it does not benefit the cases to talk publicly about these cases, and I would use evidence of some individuals we&#8217;ve been able to bring home from a variety of places in the last several months where we didn&#8217;t talk a lot about them in advance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our goal is to bring them home.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; On the President&#8217;s conversation with Modi, I’m wondering if the fact that Mayor Garcetti doesn&#8217;t have &#8212; appear to have the votes for confirmation right now, is there any concern around that, especially given how much the U.S. wants to press India not to cooperate with Russia?&nbsp; Was that &#8212; you know, the question of his confirmation discussed?&nbsp; And (inaudible) &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I’m not aware of it being a topic during the call.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does the President still support his nomination?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yep.&nbsp; He does.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, is there any reaction on the French election and the outcome with Le Pen and &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, there’s not an outcome yet.&nbsp; It goes to a runoff.&nbsp; So, obviously, at this point, we&#8217;re not going to speak to that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; In the call, Prime Minister Modi thanked President Biden for organizing this call.&nbsp; Can you give us a broader context into why this call was organized by President Biden and at this particular time?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; Well, I would say we &#8212; India is an incredibly important partner.&nbsp; We consult very closely with India on a range of issues.&nbsp; And this was an opportunity to discuss &#8212; work very closely and discuss the consequences of Russia&#8217;s unprovoked and unjustified war against Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This builds on discussions that have happened &#8212; obviously at a lower level than Prime Minister Modi and President Biden &#8212; but certainly is a reflection of the value the President sees in leader-to-leader diplomacy and having conversations that are candid, that are direct, but also provide, hopefully, a pathway to continuing to build on the steps we&#8217;ve seen India take in recent weeks.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Given the situation that (inaudible) with Pakistan, what is your assessment of the situation there, given that the (inaudible)?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; In terms of the new leadership?&nbsp; Or what aspects?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The security aspect of Pakistan (inaudible).</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;I don&#8217;t have a new assessment from here to offer.&nbsp; I would point you to the Defense Department.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; Several Parkland parents &#8212; including Manuel Oliver, who was taken into police custody at the White House in February while attempting to get the President&#8217;s attention &#8212; will be attending today&#8217;s Rose Garden event.&nbsp; Does President Biden have any plans to meet with Oliver or any of the other Parkland parents at the gun violence prevention event?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I will check.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t believe there are additional meetings.&nbsp; But obviously, inviting these incredibly courageous parents who have experienced the worst thing that can happen to a parent in their lives is a reflection of his respect and all of our respect for the work they&#8217;ve done, their advocacy, and certainly an acknowledgement of that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And yesterday &#8212; on a separate topic: Yesterday, Larry Summers warned that a recession could be on the way in the next two years, based on the inflation and unemployment rates.&nbsp; Is the White House also concerned that a recession could hit in the next two years?&nbsp; And what do you make of his prescription of tariff reduction, Strategic Petroleum Reserve release, adjusting immigration flows, and the federal government purchasing things more inexpensively?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would say a number of those things we&#8217;re already doing.&nbsp; But I would say, to your earlier question, we of course continue to assess our &#8212; the state of our economy, the health of our economy. &nbsp;</p>



<p>That&#8217;s not a projection we have made from here.&nbsp; We believe that the economy is strong.&nbsp; We have created more jobs last year than any year in American history.&nbsp; We saw the unemployment rate at 3.6 percent last month.&nbsp; And we know that as we&#8217;re continuing through an economic recovery, that there are areas that we need to focus on, including bringing down costs for the American people.</p>



<p>But we are continuing to assess.&nbsp; We have not made the &#8212; that projection from U.S. government economists that &#8212; that Larry Summers has made.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; On the guns, Biden&#8217;s approval rating on crime is at 34 percent per some of the latest polling.&nbsp; That’s at the same time, as you know, that background checks have a lot of approval from the American public, as well as there is 63 percent that have supported the ghost gun regulation that you guys are finalizing today.&nbsp; What&#8217;s causing the disconnect there?&nbsp; Is there any plan to change the White House’s messaging, moving forward, from the events today?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would first say that there&#8217;s nothing the President would love more than signing background check legislation into law.&nbsp; That&#8217;s something he has been a leader, a champion, and an advocate for throughout his career, inclu- &#8212; and also banning assault weapons.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>He&#8217;d love to be having an event in the Rose Garden today signing legislation into law.&nbsp; And you&#8217;re right: It&#8217;s hugely popular.&nbsp; It doesn&#8217;t make a lot of sense except for the hold the NRA still seems to have over components of government at this point in time &#8212; not our government, but people who are elected.</p>



<p>So, I wouldn&#8217;t say our messaging has changed.&nbsp; I think it&#8217;s important &#8212; and that&#8217;s always been the case.&nbsp; But ghost guns, we know, are an area where we can take steps to help &#8212; through executive authority and through executive actions, as the President is doing today &#8212; to put in place background checks, to put in place a requirement of serial numbers, to bring them more in line with a range of other guns.&nbsp; But we&#8217;d love to get background check &#8212; broad background check legislation signed.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then I just wanted to ask you: Do you have any response to the news that Jared Kushner secured a $2 billion investment from a fund led by Saudi Crown Prince &#8212; (inaudible) by the Saudi Crown Prince?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have any comment from here, but maybe they&#8217;ll have a comment.</p>



<p>Go ahead.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; Going back to the Ukrainian-Russian war, Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer is meeting with Putin in Moscow.&nbsp; What does the administration have to say about that? What does he &#8212; what does the President think that will achieve?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I think we&#8217;ve encouraged or supported any efforts at diplomacy.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve, though, encouraged anyone who is speaking with or meeting with &#8212; however they&#8217;re engaging &#8212; with President Putin to also engage with Ukrainians.&nbsp; They are the country that is being invaded right now.&nbsp; And so, if you&#8217;re going to play a role in diplomacy, that is an especially important component.</p>



<p>I would expect, at some point, some &#8212; we&#8217;ll get a readout of their conversation.&nbsp; So I can&#8217;t predict if it&#8217;s constructive or not.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And a follow-up on Pakistan, if you will: The new Prime Minister Sharif &#8212; what arrangements does the administration have to contact him?&nbsp; And what&#8217;s moving forward on that?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; You mean, whether there will be a call from the President?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right.&nbsp; And also &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have &#8212; oh, go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; what expectations are there for his new administration too?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don’t have a prediction of a call at this point in time.&nbsp; I mean, obviously, those are assessments made day by day and especially after new leaders are elected, of course.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have a long &#8212; a strong and abiding relationship with Pakistan &#8212; an important security relationship &#8212; and that will continue under new leaders.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey.&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; So you&#8217;ve said that 2 percent of the oil coming from Russia going &#8212; is imported into India.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; One to two.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One to two.&nbsp; That’s about 16 million barrels.&nbsp; So far, according to contracts, India has imported 13 million barrels since the war began &#8212; or since the invasion began of Ukraine.&nbsp; Why not just come out and ask them to help isolate the Russian president?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I think the President conveying, our Deputy National Security Advisor conveying they should take steps &#8212; we encourage them to take steps &#8212; to diversify; we&#8217;re here to help and assist in that &#8212; and also conveying it&#8217;s not in their interest to increase the import of Russian oil &#8212; I think that speaks for itself.</p>



<p>But we also know different countries are going to make decisions based on what their needs are economically and what the needs are for the people in their country.</p>



<p>We have, of course, banned importing &#8212; the import of oil here.&nbsp; Other countries have not done that.&nbsp; So it&#8217;s not a violation of any sanctions or any requirement or request from our end.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On inflation &#8212; so you&#8217;re saying that because of the President&#8217;s work then, we will see in the core inflation &#8212; without gas and food, you&#8217;ll see that core come down, and you&#8217;ll see the results of his work in that inflation number?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I was making a prediction not of that, but of the fact that you&#8217;re going to see &#8212; because of the increase in the price of oil, you&#8217;re going to see an increase in the overarching headline number.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the core inflation &#8212; you&#8217;re saying that the President&#8217;s (inaudible) &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; The core inflation, as you know, because you cover this very closely, does impact a range of factors that we&#8217;re still working to address.&nbsp; So &#8212; but I was making a prediction about the headline component.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Thanks, everyone.&nbsp; See you tomorrow &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; &#8212; or only if you&#8217;re going to Iowa, I guess.&nbsp; (Laughter.)</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are you going?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; For those &#8212; yes, I wouldn&#8217;t miss it.&nbsp; Been to more state fairs than most.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Via Teleconference</p>



<p>12:39&nbsp;P.M. EDT</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Great, thank you.&nbsp; And thank everyone for joining.&nbsp; So, as a reminder, this call is on background, attributable to a senior administration official, and the contents of the call are embargoed until the end of the call.</p>



<p>For your awareness and not for reporting, our speaker on the call today is [senior administration official].&nbsp; So, with that, I’ll turn it over to you for some quick remarks at the top, and then we’ll take some questions.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; Thanks, [moderator], and thank you to everyone for joining.&nbsp; As [moderator] said, I will do some remarks and we&#8217;ll do a few questions afterwards.</p>



<p>I just wanted to talk about the meeting that President Biden just held with Prime Minister Modi.&nbsp; He met virtually with Prime Minister Modi, and this is ahead of the U.S.-India 2+2 ministerial that Secretary Blinken and Secretary Austin are holding today with their Indian counterparts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>President Biden last spoke to Prime Minister Modi in early March, along with other Quad leaders.&nbsp; And as you all remember, President Biden welcomed Prime Minister Modi in person to the White House last September.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During the course of the meeting, President Biden affirmed that our partnership with India is one of our most important relationships, and the two leaders had a chance to have an hourlong, very candid conversation to discuss a range of bilateral and global issues.&nbsp; The meeting was warm and productive, and they covered a lot of ground.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The leaders were able to talk about joint efforts on the global effort to end the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp; They talked about climate.&nbsp; They talked about strengthening the global economy.&nbsp; And they talked about upholding a free and open Indo-Pacific, including the development of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework and infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And President Biden also took the opportunity to continue the close consultations we&#8217;ve been having with India at a number of different levels across our government and over the course of many weeks on Russia&#8217;s brutal war against Ukraine.&nbsp; The U.S. and India are partnering and consulting on mitigating the most destabilizing impacts, both on global food supply and other commodity markets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And throughout the course of the 2+2, today, Secretary Blinken and Secretary Austin, of course, will have the chance to go over these issues and many more, including sanctions compliance &#8212; again, including cooperation on food supply, including energy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And the 2+2 will cover also science and technology partnership initiatives.&nbsp; They’ll cover people-to-people ties.&nbsp; They will cover counterterrorism; operationalizing the Major Defense Partnership; new domains of cooperation in space and cyber and emerging technologies; and multilateral cooperation.</p>



<p>But the leaders meeting at the top was a very useful touchpoint for the two of them to share perspective on a range of issues.</p>



<p>So, let me stop there and take a couple of questions.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; Can we cue up the directions to ask a question, please?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Could you talk a little bit about whether there was any discussion on the call about the energy purchases that India is making from Russia, and whether those need to stop and whether there&#8217;s any formal kind of agreement about what that would look like?&nbsp; Thank you very much.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; The two leaders covered the whole range of issues related to Russia-Ukraine.&nbsp; It was a very candid conversation.&nbsp; I think you will have seen &#8212; even in Prime Minister Modi&#8217;s remarks at the top to press, he talked about it as well.&nbsp; They were very direct conversations.</p>



<p>On the energy issues: Of course, it&#8217;s a subject of discussion.&nbsp; We&#8217;re aware of what India &#8212; you know, we haven&#8217;t asked India to do anything in particular; we&#8217;re having a very open conversation.&nbsp; We know that not all countries will be able to do what we&#8217;ve done.&nbsp; We know that India is not a major consumer of Russian oil.&nbsp; Its current imports are about 1 to 2 percent of its total energy imports.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, as of now, our energy payments &#8212; our energy payments are exempt from current sanctions.&nbsp; And we&#8217;ve been very clear that we&#8217;ve been able to ban oil and LNG and coal imports from Russia, but other countries have to make their own choices.</p>



<p>That said, we don’t think India should accelerate or increase imports of Russian energy.&nbsp; And the U.S. is ready to support India, remain in a conversation with India about its diversification of imports.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey there.&nbsp; Following up on the last question, but maybe in a &#8212; in a little bit broader way: India has obviously been among the nations that had been more reticent to speak out against the war in Ukraine.&nbsp; They&#8217;ve obviously abstained from several votes at the U.N., including the vote the other day to withdraw &#8212; to remove Russia from the Human Rights Council.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What &#8212; did the President bring that up?&nbsp; Did the President &#8212; is this an opportunity for the President to try to push India to be &#8212; you know, essentially to take a side here, as opposed to the sort of neutral position that they&#8217;ve taken?&nbsp; Did he specifically do that?&nbsp; Did he specifically ask India to take a side?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; So, India is going to make its own judgments.&nbsp; Prime Minister Modi brought up the situation, again, in his public remarks, and there was discussion.&nbsp; I mean, the President shared his views, and Prime Minister Modi shared his views.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You will have seen in recent days that India made some pretty strong statements in New York condemning the killings of civilians, supporting calls for an independent investigation.&nbsp; India is also providing humanitarian relief material to Ukraine, including medicine and other supplies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There were close consultations in early days about the Indian students that were &#8212; needed to be evacuated from Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So we&#8217;re going to continue these discussions with India.&nbsp; I think India will make its own decisions, but we&#8217;re going to continue the discussions.</p>



<p>And as I mentioned earlier, there were conversations about how to mitigate the destabilizing impacts of Putin&#8217;s war, including on food supply, where India is in a position to assist &#8212; has done some things, and there was discussion about what more India might be able to do.</p>



<p>Q    Hi.  Thank you, guys.  Sort of following up, actually, on both the prior questions &#8212; I was wondering if any explicit commitments were made by India in regards either on oil but more broadly.  I know you said that the Prime Minister made some comments at the beginning that were public where he seemed to use stronger words to condemn Russia&#8217;s behavior.  Was that a sort of satisfactory condemnation from the Biden administration&#8217;s perspective?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; What I&#8217;ll say is that Prime Minister Modi took the opportunity to share his views in a pretty candid way about what&#8217;s going on.&nbsp;<br><br>We know that Russia has concerns &#8212; we know that India has concerns about the links between Russia and China.&nbsp; India, of course, is facing a very tense situation along the Line of Actual Control.&nbsp; And when India sees the tight links between China and Russia, that&#8217;s obviously going to impact their thinking.<br><br>Whether there was &#8212; there was no sort of concrete ask and concrete answer, but the leaders were able to step back and have a pretty detailed and candid exchange of views.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, thank you.&nbsp; Thank you for doing this.&nbsp; I wanted to ask you if the neighborhood was discussed, because the situations in both Sri Lanka and Pakistan is not that very good.&nbsp; Did that issue came up for discussion, and what was it?<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Yes, the leaders did discuss developments in the region, in South Asia.&nbsp; They touched on some of the developments in Sri Lanka, in Bangladesh.&nbsp; And I know that our State Department colleagues will be able to follow up on those discussions.&nbsp; It wasn&#8217;t a detailed discussion by the leaders, but it did come up.&nbsp; And I am positive there will be more detailed discussions throughout the course of the next day and a half.</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; All right.&nbsp; Well, thanks, everyone, for joining.&nbsp; As a reminder, this call was on background, attributable to a “senior administration official.”&nbsp; And the embargo on the call will lift at the end of this call.&nbsp;<br><br>If you have any other questions, please feel free to reach out to me and we&#8217;ll make sure to get back to you.&nbsp;<br><br>Thanks, everyone.</p>

<p>11:24 A.M. EDT<br> <br>PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Prime Minister Modi, it’s always good to see you.  I’m looking forward to seeing you in Japan, about the 24th of May.  And I was honored to welcome you to the White House last September to discuss U.S.-India relations, to meet with our fellow Quad leaders.  <br> <br>And I&#8217;m pleased to have this opportunity to speak with you today virtually and with your two ministers and your ambassador here in person.  <br> <br>(Referring to the language interpretation.)  Is it contemporaneous? <br> <br>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  Yes, (inaudible).<br> <br>PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Oh, I&#8217;m sorry.  (Laughs.)<br> <br>As two vibrant democracies who &#8212; one is learning how to make sure I can do this contemporaneously, but &#8212; two vibrant democracies, we have a &#8212; we take the same concerns about the global challenges we face &#8212; from COVID-19, advancing health security, and tracking the climate crisis &#8212; and we share a strong and growing Major Defense Partnership. <br> <br>At the root of our partnership is a deep connection between our people &#8212; ties of family, of friendship, and of shared values.  <br> <br>On that note, I want to welcome India&#8217;s humanitarian support for the people of Ukraine, who are suffering a horrific assault, including a tragic shelling in a train station last week that killed dozens of innocent children and women and civilians attempting to flee the violence.<br> <br>The United States and India are going to continue our close consultation on how to manage the destabilizing effects of this Russian war.  <br> <br>And I&#8217;m looking forward to our discussions today, Mr. Prime Minister.  Our continued consultation and dialogue are key to ensuring the U.S.-India relationship continues to grow deeper and stronger, delivering our people and our global good &#8212; good that we all are seeking to manage, particularly in your part of the world. <br> <br>And the floor is yours, Mr. Prime Minister.<br> <br>PRIME MINISTER MODI:  (As interpreted.)  President Biden, I would like to, first of all, express my gratitude to you for your warm words.  Our defense and foreign ministers will be meeting today in the 2+2 format in a short while from now.<br> <br>Our meeting before that is very important, as it will provide direction for the discussions.  I also appreciate your initiative to organize today&#8217;s virtual meeting.<br> <br>Excellency, when I was in Washington last year in September &#8212; and you, in fact, mentioned that &#8212; you had said at the time that the India-America partnership can contribute to solving a lot of global problems.  I totally agree with you.<br> <br>As two democracies that are the world’s largest and oldest, we are natural partners.  And the progress that has taken place in our relations in the last few years, the new momentum that has been created would have been hard to even imagine a few decades ago.<br> <br>Excellency, our talks today are taking place at a time when the situation in Ukraine is very worrying.<br> <br>A few weeks ago, over 20,000 Indians were stuck in Ukraine, and most of them were young students.  After a lot of hard work, we were successful in getting them all out safely.  One student, however, lost his life.<br> <br>During this entire process, I spoke several times on the phone to the presidents of both Ukraine and Russia.  I not only appealed for peace, but also suggested that there be direct talks between President Putin and the President of Ukraine.<br> <br>We had extensive discussions on Ukraine in our parliament as well. <br> <br>Recently, the news about the killings of innocent civilians in the Bucha city was very worrying.  We instantly condemned the killings and have called for an independent inquiry.  <br> <br>We hope that the ongoing discussions between Russia and Ukraine will lead to peace.<br> <br>Excellency, we have also emphasized the importance of the security of civilians in Ukraine and the unhindered supply of humanitarian assistance to them &#8212; and you mentioned this, in fact. <br> <br>On our part, we have sent medicines and other relief material to Ukraine and to its neighboring countries.  And on Ukraine&#8217;s request, we will be sending them another consignment of medicines very soon.<br> <br>Excellency, at the beginning of your term in office, you’d used a very important slogan: “Democracies can deliver.”  The India-America partnership and the success of the India-America partnership is the best means to make this slogan meaningful.<br> <br>This year, India is celebrating 75 years of its independence, and we are also celebrating the 75th anniversary of our diplomatic relations as well.  I am confident that our friendship with America will be an integral part of India&#8217;s development journey over the next 25 years.<br> <br>Once again, my thanks to you for organizing this event.<br> <br>PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister.  We&#8217;re going to hold for just a moment, Mr. Prime Minister, while the press leaves the room.  <br> <br>11:31 A.M. EDT</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>President Biden is committed to creating an economy that works for every American. Part of that agenda is to ensure that families in Puerto Rico are treated fairly in our tax system. Historically, the prior Child Tax Credit (CTC) only applied to families in Puerto Rico with three or more qualifying children, and therefore only 10% of families with children were eligible.<br>&nbsp;<br>That changed when President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan (ARP). It not only provided the largest Child Tax Credit nationwide to the most ever families, it also made sure that, for the first time, families and children in Puerto Rico fully benefited – permanently fixing the credit to give Puerto Rico families equal access. This tax filing season, 97% of Puerto Rico families with children are now eligible for the expanded CTC. The law also <em><u>permanently</u></em> changed the structure of the CTC so that every child in Puerto Rico will get the credit on the same basis as all other American children. This will mean that parents in Puerto Rico will have, as President Biden says, a “little more breathing room” in meeting the costs of raising a family and that there will be fewer children in Puerto Rico living in poverty.<br>&nbsp;<br>The ARP also meant a historic expansion of the federal government’s commitment to expand the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) in Puerto Rico. Together, the expanded CTC and EITC could provide an estimated $1 billion annually in critical benefits to hundreds of thousands of low- and moderate-income working people and families in Puerto Rico.<br>&nbsp;<br>Today, as part of a final push to encourage families in Puerto Rico to file their taxes and receive both the CTC and EITC, First Lady Dr. Jill Biden, Education Secretary Miguel Cardona, House Chairwoman Nydia Velazquez, Deputy Secretary of Treasury Wally Adeyemo, and American Rescue Plan Coordinator Gene Sperling are holding a special virtual event with UnidosUS, the Hispanic Federation, the Institute of Youth Development/Instituto del Desarrollo de la Juventud (IDJ), Espacios Abiertos, and United Way of Puerto Rico. The Biden Administration and these leading non-profits are urging families to file their taxes by April 18<sup>th</sup> to take advantage of this critical aid.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>The American Rescue Plan made historic, permanent changes to the Child Tax Credit for Puerto Rico families – making the credit available to 97% of Puerto Rico families this year, compared to 10% before the ARP</strong></p>



<ul><li>Previously, <strong><em><u>only Puerto Rico families with three or more qualifying children or more qualified for any Child Tax Credit benefit</u></em></strong>.<br></li><li>This meant that before the American Rescue Plan, <strong><em><u>only about 10% of Puerto Rico families qualified for any Child Tax Credit.<br></u></em></strong></li><li>The ARP permanently changed that policy to extend the CTC to Puerto Rico families with fewer than three qualifying children who were previously excluded. <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/blog/tax-credit-expansions-expected-to-significantly-reduce-poverty-in-puerto-rico">As a result</a> of the ARP, <strong><em><u>97% of Puerto Rico families with children are eligible for the 2021 Child Tax Credit.<br></u></em></strong></li><li>For 2021, the ARP increased the Child Tax Credit to <strong><em><u>$3,600 per child under 6 and $3,000 per child 6-17</u></em></strong> – and ensured that lower income families could access the full credit.<br></li><li>In addition, the ARP provided the first-ever federal support for Puerto Rico’s local Earned Income Tax Credit – allowing Puerto Rico to <strong><u>more than</u></strong> triple EITC <strong><u>benefits</u></strong> and extend <strong><u>the EITC</u></strong> to more workers for the next 10 years.</li></ul>



<p>Together, the ARP’s expansions of the CTC and EITC are&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-tax/american-rescue-plan-act-provides-critical-permanent-tax-relief-to-puerto-rico">estimated</a>&nbsp;to <strong>provide over $1 billion in tax relief</strong> per year going forward. They stand to benefit hundreds of thousands of Puerto Rico families – with the families of over 500,000 children eligible for the 2021 expanded CTC.<br><br><strong>Today’s event builds on substantial White House-Treasury Department efforts to ensure access to the 2021 Child Tax Credit in Puerto Rico:</strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>The White House and Treasury Department in collaboration with UnidosUS created a Weekly CTC/EITC Puerto Rico Working Group, with the Youth Development Institute (IDJ), Espacios Abiertos, Hispanic Federation, and others, to increase awareness and take up rates</strong> among newly eligible families in Puerto Rico for the CTC and Local EITC. This group is comprised of representatives of the Puerto Rico government, Hacienda (the local tax authority), Treasury, IRS, and local stakeholders — including community-based organizations and other advocates in Puerto Rico – who work to remove barriers for the implementation of tax credit policies. Collaboration across these groups has already led to the execution or launch of over 35 local community events, navigator trainings and capacity building engagements for local elected officials and municipal staff. More than 240 municipal and state agencies employees were trained to scale and implement integrated outreach strategies and provide free tax preparation services for low-to-middle income communities.<br></li><li><strong>The White House and Treasury Department collaborated closely with the Governor of Puerto Rico, Mayors, foundations and NGOs on the island to increase awareness and CTC sign-ups in Puerto Rico. </strong>The White House ARP Implementation Coordinator, White House Intergovernmental Affairs and Treasury teams met twice at the White House with the Governor of Puerto Rico on CTC outreach strategy and had several meetings with top Puerto Rican mayors. The White House ARP Implementation Team also organized several meetings with foundations on the importance of investing in CTC outreach in Puerto Rico.<br></li><li><strong>The Administration launched a stand-alone section of ChildTaxCredit.gov for Puerto Rico families and outreach partners. </strong><a href="https://www.childtaxcredit.gov/es/puerto-rico/">Childtaxcredit.gov/es/puerto-rico/</a> highlights the unique and unprecedented access for families with children to benefit from the enhanced CTC and provides information on how to claim the credit in plain language, Spanish, and a mobile friendly format.<br></li><li><strong>The Treasury Department and the White House worked to build capacity for Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) Centers and Facilitated Self-Assistance (FSA) Sites</strong>, including through navigator training and volunteer recruitment scale-up for tax prep assistance in low income communities. Currently there are 43 tax assistance sites, including VITA and FSA in the island.<br></li><li><strong>The Administration amplified the island-wide public campaign by the Alliance for Economic Security in Puerto Rico, and garnering support from state/local government. </strong>The Alliance, composed by the Hispanic Federation, Instituto del Desarrollo de la Juventud (IDJ) and Espacios Abiertos coalesced to launch &nbsp;<a href="https://reclamatudineropr.com/">ReclamaTuDineroPR.com</a> to further promote awareness of these tax benefits. In addition, the Administration has helped amplify these efforts and match trained IRS volunteers with Mayors and municipalities to host “Fill-a-thons” (“Llenatones” in Spanish) &#8211; to ensure all families with children learn about the credit and can receive tax filing assistance through a local community event.&nbsp;<br></li><li><strong>Treasury provided training for mayors in Puerto Rico on how to leverage ARP State &amp; Fiscal Recovery Funds (SLFRF) to do CTC and EITC outreach and tax filing assistance outreach </strong>in collaboration with the White House, the Government of Puerto Rico, the Association of Mayors, and the Federation of Mayors of Puerto Rico to maximize critical State and Local ARP funds for local governments in Puerto Rico.</li></ul>

<p>Today, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. announced that former U.S. Senator Christopher Dodd of Connecticut and former U.S. Representative Debbie Mucarsel-Powell of Florida will serve as special advisors for the Ninth Summit of the Americas that will take place from June 6 through June 10 in Los Angeles, California.</p>



<p>Senator Dodd served as a member and Chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere for over three decades. Senator Dodd and President Biden worked closely together on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for over 28 years. Senator Dodd’s interest in Latin America began years before his election to the U.S. Congress. In the 1960s, Dodd joined President John Kennedy’s Peace Corps, serving for two years as a volunteer in the Dominican Republic. During his service in the Peace Corps and in the Senate, he traveled extensively and on numerous occasions throughout the hemisphere.</p>



<p>As the first and only Latina Democrat to ever represent a Congressional district in Florida, and the first-ever Member of Congress born in Ecuador, Congresswoman Mucarsel-Powell was a leading voice in the charge to support Venezuelans fleeing their country through securing Temporary Protected Status in the United States and providing humanitarian and other aid to the Venezuelan people and neighboring countries. She served as chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Women’s Task Force and also sponsored environmental and public health legislation.</p>



<p>Senator Dodd and Congresswoman Mucarsel-Powell are confident that President Biden will renew and strengthen the collaboration and respect essential for a bright future for the Americas at the upcoming Summit in Los Angeles this June.</p>



<p>The Summit of the Americas, the only meeting that brings together the leaders of North, South, and Central America and the Caribbean, will play a central role in shaping the future of the Americas at a critical time in our history.&nbsp; The region’s governments, civil society, and private sector will work to develop a shared vision built around the theme for this year’s meeting, “Building a Sustainable, Resilient, and Equitable Future.”</p>



<p>The United States looks forward to welcoming the hemisphere to Los Angeles to work together on strengthening our democracies, building more prosperous and inclusive economies, and better protecting the human rights, health, dignity, and security of our people.  The United States previously hosted the inaugural Summit of the Americas in Miami, Florida, in 1994.</p>

<p>As we work together to build a better America, we must remember that education is the key to achieving greater opportunity, prosperity, stability, and equality both here and around the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;A high-quality education develops the mind, opens the heart, nurtures our talents, and fortifies our character.&nbsp;&nbsp;Through education, we learn to recognize ourselves in our neighbors and cherish the dignity of our shared human experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;No one understood this better than the man whose life and legacy we celebrate on this day:&nbsp;&nbsp;Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the Lubavitcher Rebbe and leader of the Chabad-Lubavitch movement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Rebbe&#8217;s devotion to educating people worldwide and his profound respect for diversity, inclusiveness, and equal justice have set a strong example for generations of Americans and people across the globe.  Having survived one of history&#8217;s cruelest chapters, the Rebbe emerged determined to help heal the soul of humanity.  He left his mark as a thinker, leader, and teacher who recognized the limitless potential of every human being regardless of their background.  His outreach is still felt today in countless houses of worship, centers of education, cultural exchanges, and service communities worldwide.</p>



<p>The Rebbe&#8217;s work reminds us, in the words of the Prophet Amos, to &#8220;hate evil, love good, and establish justice in the gate.&#8221;  We each share a responsibility to live up to those words &#8212; in and out of the classroom &#8212; and to plant the seeds of love, kindness, and empathy in the hearts and minds of every child in America.  </p>



<p>To ensure that our children are provided every opportunity to learn and grow, my Administration provided resources through the American Rescue Plan for schools to safely reopen for in-person instruction.  Today, thanks to our COVID-19 strategy and the resilience of local communities, more than 99 percent of America&#8217;s schools are open again.  But if we are truly going to build a better America, we must continue to make transformational investments in education &#8212; including making high-quality pre-school available to every 3- and 4-year old in America and coming together to address the invisible toll on children&#8217;s mental health that was exacerbated by the pandemic.</p>



<p>Today &#8212; on what would have been the Rebbe&#8217;s 120th birthday &#8212; let us celebrate all the educators, advocates, and pioneers who teach young people the lessons that create caring neighbors and closer communities.  Let us commit to learning together, sharing the best we have to offer, and working in unity for the common good. </p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 12, 2022, as Education and Sharing Day, USA.&nbsp;&nbsp;I call upon all government officials, educators, volunteers, and all the people of the United States to observe this day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.</p>



<p>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eleventh day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-sixth.                               </p>

					<description><![CDATA[Today, the White House released a Bipartisan Infrastructure Law Rural Playbook to help state, local, Tribal and territorial governments in rural areas unlock the benefits from the historic investments in our nation’s infrastructure and launched a rural infrastructure tour led by the President and other senior administration officials to engage rural communities across the country.&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>Today, the White House released a Bipartisan Infrastructure Law <a href="https://build.gov/rural">Rural Playbook</a> to help state, local, Tribal and territorial governments in rural areas unlock the benefits from the historic investments in our nation’s infrastructure and launched a rural infrastructure tour led by the President and other senior administration officials to engage rural communities across the country.</p>



<p>The Rural Playbook, found at build.gov/rural, builds on the release of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law Guidebook and provides rural communities with information on the “what, when, where, and how to apply” for funding under the law – so no community needs to hire a lobbyist to access their government. The Playbook also identifies over 100 programs funded under the law with federal cost share flexibilities and matching requirement waivers.</p>



<p>During the month of April, Biden Administration officials will travel to dozens of rural communities as part of a Building A Better America rural infrastructure tour to talk about the impact of Bipartisan Infrastructure Law investments, as well as the President’s broader commitment to ensure federal resources reach all communities in rural America. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, EPA Administrator Michael Regan, Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Infrastructure Coordinator Mitch Landrieu will take part in events, along with other senior administration officials.</p>



<p>President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will send billions of dollars to rural communities across the country. Supporting Americans living in rural areas remains a top priority for the Biden Administration, and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law delivers on the President’s promises to provide high speed internet, safe roads and bridges, modern wastewater systems, clean drinking water, reliable and affordable electricity, and good paying jobs in every rural community. As part of this effort, the Biden Administration is also committed to working with communities to help them access federal resources and improving transparency.</p>



<p>“This Rural Playbook and our rural infrastructure tour are a critical part of our extensive outreach to state, local, tribal and territorial governments to ensure the people of America can benefit from this once-in-a-generation investment,” said <strong>Mitch Landrieu, Senior Advisor &amp; Infrastructure Implementation Coordinator.</strong> “Building a better America requires these funds to reach rural communities that have been left behind for far too long.&nbsp; We see you, and major investments are on the way. With these investments in infrastructure in rural communities, President Biden is delivering for rural America.”</p>



<p>Across the month of April, the Biden-Harris administration will announce billions for rural areas including rural water projects, flood mitigation, transportation, healthcare, and tribal community grants, along with new technical assistance programs for rural and tribal communities.&nbsp; Earlier this month, the Department of the Interior <a href="https://doi.gov/pressreleases/interior-department-announces-420-million-rural-water-funding-president-bidens">announced $420 million for rural water systems</a> across six states: Iowa, Minnesota, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota and South Dakota. Today, the President is also announcing a $1 billion America the Beautiful Challenge that will leverage Federal conservation and restoration investments with private and philanthropic contributions to accelerate land, water, and wildlife conservation efforts across the country. The America the Beautiful Challenge is anchored by an initial commitment of $440 million of Federal resources over the next five years to a new public-private grant program, administered by the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation (NFWF), that will support locally led ecosystem restoration projects that invest in watershed restoration, resilience, equitable access, workforce development, corridors and connectivity, and collaborative conservation, consistent with the America the Beautiful Initiative. The America the Beautiful Challenge will offer states, Tribes, territories, local groups, non-governmental organizations, and others the opportunity to apply for multiple grant programs through a single application that is managed by NFWF.</p>



<p>Since President Biden signed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law nearly five months ago, the Biden-Harris Administration has hit the ground running to deliver results. The Administration has made key progress towards implementing the largest long-term investment in America’s infrastructure and competitiveness in nearly a century. More than $100 billion has been announced and allocated to states from formula and competitive programs for roads and highways, bridges, ports, airports, electric vehicle charging stations, water systems, high speed internet, weatherization and clean energy.</p>

<p>I have always believed that for America to succeed, rural America must succeed. Since taking office, my Administration has focused on building pathways to the middle class for rural Americans in rural America – including investing in rural infrastructure and rebuilding the communities that feed and fuel our country.</p>



<p>For far too long, opportunity has been out of reach for rural communities. My Administration is changing that. Through the American Rescue Plan, we supported rural families and provided rural communities with the tools and resources that made them central to America’s strong economic recovery. I also secured historic investments for rural America through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to make sure we revitalize and rebuild rural communities for years to come. These generational infrastructure investments will provide rural communities across America affordable high-speed internet, clean drinking water, reliable electricity, better roads and bridges, and good-paying jobs. Strong infrastructure in rural communities is good for jobs, good for keeping the economy moving, good for lowering prices, and good for America.</p>



<p>I am proud today that my Administration is launching a rural infrastructure tour to double down on our unwavering commitment to building a better America where rural communities thrive. In the coming weeks and beyond, Cabinet members and senior administration officials will crisscross the country to meet with, listen to, and deliver infrastructure investments to rural communities. As we unlock federal resources and generate results for these communities, we are unlocking opportunity – job opportunities, educational opportunities, and the opportunity for a better future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Vice President Kamala Harris to announce reforms across four areas to ease the burden of medical debt,</em>&nbsp;<em>giving more American families the opportunity to thrive</em></p>



<p>Today,&nbsp;as part of the fight to help Americans deal with high costs,&nbsp;the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing new actions to protect consumers and lessen the burden of medical debt on American families. Together, these actions will help:</p>



<ul><li>Hold medical providers and debt collectors accountable for harmful practices;</li><li>Reduce the role that medical debt plays in determining whether Americans can access credit – which will open up new opportunities for people with medical debt to buy a home or get a small business loan;</li><li>Help over half a million of low-income American veterans get their medical debt forgiven; and,</li><li>Inform consumers of their rights.</li></ul>



<p>One-in-three adults in the United States have medical debt. It is now the largest source of debt in collections—more than credit cards, utilities, and auto loans combined.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2021/04/who-had-medical-debt-in-united-states.html">Black and Hispanic households</a>&nbsp;are more likely to hold medical debt than white households.</p>



<p>Medical debt is not just a financial issue—it can have negative health effects too. One&nbsp;<a href="https://nmahoney.people.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj23976/files/media/file/kaiser_20210831.pdf">study</a>&nbsp;found that almost half of individuals with medical debt intentionally avoided seeking care.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Getting sick or taking care of loved ones should not mean financial hardship for American families. That is why the Administration is taking new action to ease the burden of medical debt and protect consumers from predatory collection policies. These actions build upon the President’s April 5<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2022/04/05/executive-order-on-continuing-to-strengthen-americans-access-to-affordable-quality-health-coverage/?msclkid=887ba3d9b67111ec81e80c7ddd11167b">Executive Order</a>&nbsp;on strengthening access to affordable, quality health care coverage, which directed federal agencies to take action to reduce the burden of medical debt.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, Vice President Harris is announcing reforms in four areas that will lessen the burden of medical debt, protect consumers, and open up new opportunities for Americans looking to buy a home or start a small business.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Holding Providers and Collectors Accountable&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>When families cannot afford to pay the cost of care—often because they are uninsured or underinsured—<a href="https://finhealthnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Medical-Debt-and-Financial-Health-Executive-Summary.pdf">providers have a responsibility</a> to offer non-predatory payment plans or financial assistance to all eligible patients. While many do, far too many eligible patients report not receiving help. Worse, lawsuits against patients over medical bills <a href="https://news.yale.edu/2021/12/06/study-finds-spike-hospitals-suing-patients-over-unpaid-medical-bills?msclkid=a446f5ebb6cc11ecbc00812a3db42912">are on the rise</a>. And when hospitals sell outstanding bills to third party debt collectors, patients can be subjected to persistent and aggressive collections practices. </p>



<p>The federal government pays roughly $1.5 trillion a year into the health care system to provide patients with quality care and services. Providers receiving that funding should make it easy for eligible patients to receive the financial assistance they are entitled to, and should not directly or indirectly subject patients to illegal and harassing debt collection practices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, Secretary Becerra is directing the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to evaluate how providers’ billing practices impact access and affordability of care and the accrual of medical debt. HHS will request data from more than 2,000 providers on medical bill collection practices, lawsuits against patients, financial assistance, financial product offerings, and 3<sup>rd</sup>&nbsp;party contracting or debt buying practices.&nbsp;The Department will, for the first time, weigh this information in their grantmaking decisions, publish topline data and policy recommendations for the public, and share potential violations with the relevant enforcement agencies of jurisdiction.</p>



<p>Separately, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) will investigate credit reporting companies and debt collectors that violate patients’ and families’ rights, and hold violators accountable. The CFPB has already issued a&nbsp;<a href="https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.consumerfinance.gov%2Fabout-us%2Fnewsroom%2Fcfpb-issues-bulletin-to-prevent-unlawful-medical-debt-collection-and-credit-reporting%2F&amp;data=04%7C01%7CDiane.Thompson%40cfpb.gov%7C1fafc34fb3d945dfc6ef08da17e3e25d%7Cc817bf69ef414ed6ac5f1f44da3798c0%7C0%7C0%7C637848564786280189%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&amp;sdata=piCtFykML5hUkeNWUupGnfZeQ9utyxObMhdlYbdiVDo%3D&amp;reserved=0">bulletin</a>&nbsp;to prevent unlawful medical debt collection and reporting. The CFPB will target coercive credit reporting and determine whether unpaid medical billing data should ever be included in credit reports.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Improve Government Underwriting Practices</strong></p>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aei.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Batty-Gibbs-Ippolito-health-insurance-medical-debt-financial-well-being-WP.pdf?x91208">latest research</a>&nbsp;finds that owing medical debt is not a reliable predictor of overall financial health. An&nbsp;<a href="https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/201405_cfpb_report_data-point_medical-debt-credit-scores.pdf">analysis</a>&nbsp;of 5 million anonymized credit records found that consumers who owed medical debt paid their bills at the same rate as those who did not. In fact, including paid-off medical debt causes credit scores to&nbsp;<a href="https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/201405_cfpb_report_data-point_medical-debt-credit-scores.pdf">underestimate</a>&nbsp;creditworthiness by as much as 22 points. As a result, the inclusion of medical debt on credit reports and in credit scores and loan underwriting can hold American’s back from financial opportunities while failing to improve the accuracy and predictiveness of lending programs.</p>



<p>The private sector has taken important steps to address this problem. Last month, the three largest credit reporting agencies—Equifax, Experian, and Transunion—announced that they will no longer include certain forms of medical debt on credit reports, removing billions of dollars in debt from consumer reports. This change covers borrowers with already paid debts, unpaid debts less than a year old, and debts paid or unpaid under $500.</p>



<p>However, this change leaves out a third of Americans with medical debt over $500. For example, 11 million Americans have medical debt above $2000 and 3 million Americans have debt over $10,000. Further action is needed to help families struggling with medical debt.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to leading the way. The federal government is one of the largest actors in consumer credit markets, directly providing tens of billions of loans annually to millions of Americans, and guaranteeing or holding up to&nbsp;70% of all mortgages. Government action matters.&nbsp;Americans with medical debt can apply for an FHA-backed mortgage without fear that medical debt will keep them from being able to buy a home. FHA – which&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hud.gov/sites/dfiles/Housing/images/FHASFMarketShare2021Q4.pdf">backs over 12 % of new home purchases</a>&nbsp;in America &#8212; has eliminated medical debt from consideration when evaluating a borrower’s creditworthiness.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>That is why, today, the Administration is announcing actions that&nbsp;go beyond recent private sector announcements.</p>



<p><em><u>The Biden-Harris Administration is providing guidance to all agencies to eliminate medical debt as a factor for underwriting in credit programs</u></em>, whenever possible and consistent with law. Medical debt is not a reliable indicator of credit quality, and its impact should be reduced or eliminated to give more American families the opportunity to thrive:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Americans with medical debt can apply for USDA rural housing service loans without fear that their medical debt could keep them from getting a mortgage. Today, USDA is announcing that it will discontinue the inclusion of any recurring medical debts into borrower repayment calculations, which measure a borrower’s ability to repay for its homeownership programs—<a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R47044">over $20 billion</a> in lending activity. <br> </li><li>The Department of Veteran Affairs has taken multiple steps to ensure credit reporting and underwriting regarding medical debt, including finalizing a rule to virtually cease reporting of medical debt for veterans with bills from VA Care. VA will also review its underwriting guidelines to ensure we minimize or eliminate medical debt reporting as a proxy for creditworthiness, wherever possible.</li></ul>



<ul><li>The Small Business Administration has a demonstrated commitment to ensuring credit access and a vested interest in accurate credit reporting and underwriting.&nbsp;&nbsp;To further this commitment, SBA will work with its colleagues and partners to lessen the financial burden of medical debt for families and to review SBA lending programs to identify ways to reduce the negative impact of medical debt on small business access to capital.</li></ul>



<ul><li>FHFA is reviewing the credit models that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac use and looking at ways to ensure that measures of creditworthiness are accurate, reliable, and predictive.</li></ul>



<p>To reinforce these measures, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) will be issuing new guidance to agencies to, whenever possible and consistent with law, eliminate medical debt as a factor for underwriting in credit programs, or reduce its impact.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Support Veterans in Financial Hardship</strong></p>



<p>Since the start of the pandemic, VA has&nbsp;<strong>cancelled or refunded approximately $1 billion in copayments to over 1.5 million veterans.</strong>&nbsp;The&nbsp;American Rescue Plan (ARP) eliminated all out-of-pocket medical cost for veterans enrolled in VA health care and provided much needed financial relief to veterans experiencing economic hardship during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>



<p>Veterans Affairs (VA) will now make it easier and faster for lower-income veterans to get their VA medical debt forgiven. Currently, veterans in financial hardship who need medical debt relief from VA must fill out a complex, paper form with complicated eligibility requirements. The application process is confusing, time-consuming, and as a result, veterans may be deterred from applying for much-needed relief.&nbsp;To address these problems and ensure that veterans get the relief they deserve, VA will streamline the request process, including offering an online option to apply, and set a simple income threshold to qualify for relief.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.va.gov/opa/pressrel/pressrelease.cfm?id=5758">VA has also published a final rule</a>&nbsp;under which it will virtually cease reporting unfavorable debt, including medical debt, to consumer reporting agencies. The new rule ensures that debt reported better reflects creditworthiness, while saving veterans from further financial struggles simply because they had to take on medical debt.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Help Consumers Know Their Rights</strong></p>



<p>The CFPB will ramp-up its consumer education tools aimed at helping American families navigate the complex and often confusing medical billing landscape, including more materials specifically designed to help patients access the financial assistance they are entitled to.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The CFPB has a wide range of tools available to help patients and their families confronting medical billing and collections, particularly problems relating to debt collection and credit reporting, at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/consumer-tools/">consumerfinance.gov</a>. People experiencing aggressive debt collection, coercive credit reporting, or other problems with a consumer financial product or service related to medical billing and collections can submit a complaint to the CFPB at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/complaint/">consumerfinance.gov/complaint.</a></p>
