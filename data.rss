<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Carole Hoefener Center<br><em>Charlotte, North Carolina</em></em></p>



<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Governor Cooper.  And back at you.  (Laughter.)  Because we have &#8212; Roy Cooper and I stood shoulder-to-shoulder fighting for working people of America.  And I&#8217;ve seen him in rooms when there are no cameras and in rooms when the cameras are on, and he&#8217;s always fighting for the people.<br> <br>So it is my honor and joy to join you yet again as we stand up for the principles that I think we, as Americans, hold dear.<br> <br>I will also mention what I don&#8217;t need to tell all the leaders here, who are not only state leaders but national leaders on so many issues: We got to make sure that Governor Cooper &#8212; who is right now the only line of defense in the state house, in terms of his veto power &#8212; that we ensure that we give him the support he needs in terms of the legislature so that he can continue to hold the line, as you have been.  And thank you for that.<br> <br>There are certain principles that are at stake on this issue and in this discussion.  And one of them is that every woman in America should be free to make decisions about her own body without government interference. <br> <br>And let&#8217;s be frank about this issue: As has been said, to stand for a woman&#8217;s right to make one of the most intimate decisions that she can make about her own life without government interference, to agree with the importance of her right and ability to do that does not require you to abandon your faith or your beliefs.  It&#8217;s to agree that she should be able to make that right without the government telling her what to do.<br> <br>That really is, as much as anything, what&#8217;s at stake here.  Every woman should be free to make that decision for herself and, if she chooses, in consultation with her loved one, with her physician, with her pastor, her priest, her rabbi.  But the government should not be making this decision for her. <br> <br>Ultimately, that is what this is about.  It&#8217;s about one of the most important principles upon which our nation was founded: freedom, liberty &#8212; freedom from government interference in the most intimate decisions that are essentially about heart and home.  Because when we look at what&#8217;s going on right now, let&#8217;s understand it is the issue of choice. <br> <br>But it is an interpretation of the right to privacy that &#8212; you know, Clarence Thomas said the quiet part out loud &#8212; puts at risk the right to make decisions about contraception, the right to make decisions about who you love in terms of same-sex marriage.  All of this is at stake. <br> <br>So, the United States Supreme Court took a constitutional right, that had been guaranteed and recognized, from the people of America &#8212; the women of America.  That is also what is at stake. <br> <br>And as Vice President, I have traveled the world.  I have talked with at least 80 prime ministers, presidents, kings around the globe.  And when we look at our highest court taking a constitutional right from the people of our country, we must understand what this also means in term of &#8212; in terms of what we stand for as a democracy, which has stated certain principles about the rights of individuals to be free from interference by their government.  So all of this is at stake. <br> <br>And we are looking at &#8212; in particular, after the Dobbs decision, but even before &#8212; extremist so-called leaders around the country who are daring to also pass laws that will not provide an exception for violent criminal acts like rape and incest. <br> <br>I spent the majority of my career as a prosecutor.  And during the time that I was working in courtrooms, a great deal of my focus was on crimes against women and children, including child sexual assault. <br> <br>And we have so-called leaders who are saying there is no exception for those violent acts, for that woman, for that person to be able to have agency over their own body after they have been a victim of such a heinous act.<br> <br>These are the issues that are at stake right now in our country.  This is what&#8217;s happening right now in our country. <br> <br>And so, yes, the President has signed an executive order to say that we, in terms of the federal government, will do what we must and what we can through the executive branch to protect a woman&#8217;s legal right, in terms of interstate travel, to protect access to medication. <br> <br>But we have three coequal branches of government.  The Court has acted now.  Now it is time for Congress to act and to codify the protections of Roe, which means to put it into law at a national level. <br> <br>And this is also going to require us to look to the leaders in the states to do what the leaders here in North Carolina, at this table and elsewhere, have been doing: to have the courage to stand up for the rights of women and the rights of the American people to make certain decisions for themselves. <br> <br>And so, I&#8217;m here to thank you all.  You are fighting on the frontlines, including our courageous service providers.  And we are in this together. <br> <br>I will emphasize again &#8212; you know, I asked my team to do a Venn diagram for me of where we are seeing attacks and who are the attacks against and the similarity.  And if you look at attacks on a woman&#8217;s right to choose, attacks against the LGBTQ community, attacks on voting rights &#8212; it&#8217;s very interesting to see a lot of them are coming from the same source. <br> <br>And so that&#8217;s also to say that let&#8217;s bring folks together, understanding that on this issue, as well as so many others, we all have so much more in common than what separates us, in terms of the need to stand up for these rights against those who have decided to attack them, and to do so fighting for the best of who we are as a country. <br> <br>And with that, I look forward to our discussion. <br> <br>And, again, I thank you.  I&#8217;m here to listen as much as I am to share with you my thoughts because, truly, we have extraordinary leaders here in this beautiful state. <br> <br>So with that, thank you all.  And I think we should begin our discussion. <br> <br>Okay, thank you.  (Applause.)<br> </p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Carole Hoefener Center<br><em>Charlotte, North Carolina</em></em></p>



<p>1:32 P.M. EDT<br><br>THE VICE PRESIDENT:  All right!  Can we hear it for Ms. Tiffany?  (Applause.) <br> <br>Well, good afternoon, Charlotte.  It’s so good to be back.  Good afternoon.  You know, Ms. Tiffany and I were talking in the back, and I said, you know, “The President” &#8212; who I’m going to speak of in a moment &#8212; “The President &#8212; I talked to him this morning.  I told him I was on my way here.  And he said, ‘Tell everybody hello.’”  And he knew why I was here, which is to talk about what we are doing to connect folks to high-speed Internet. <br> <br>And the work that we’re going in Washington, D.C., the work that we are doing in terms of the policy work, it’s not real until it hits the streets.  It’s not real until real people have the ability to take advantage of what we hope will help them and uplift their lives.<br> <br>And the connectivity, if you will, between what we do in Washington, D.C., and it hitting the streets of Charlotte are people like Ms. Tiffany.  So she makes all the difference.  So, again, can we please applaud her?  (Applause.)  Please applaud her.<br> <br>And before I begin, I do &#8212; wanted to speak about our incredible President, Joe Biden.  This morning, he and I spoke by phone.  He is in good spirits.  He is feeling well.  He is doing well.  He is fully vaccinated and twice boosted.  And &#8212; of course, he is, and as everyone we &#8212; who would encourage, who was eligible, would do the same.  And he is working from the White House Residence.<br><br>And when we spoke, he was very pleased, as I said, that we were all here together today talking about the work our administration is doing on behalf of parents and working families and all who deserve to be seen and heard.<br> <br>So, with that, it is good to be with everyone today.  The great Governor Roy Cooper.  Where is Roy?  He was here earlier.  He’s been with me all at &#8212; he’s been with me all morning and met me on the tarmac. <br> <br>And I have to tell you, Roy Cooper is extraordinary, because there’s so much about we are doing that is about getting these resources to folks.  But we cannot do it if there’s not a governor in place who takes seriously the importance of the partnership to make sure that they don’t let anything get in the way of the services and resources getting to the people of the states.  So I really do thank Governor Roy Cooper for all that he has done.  And if we’d applaud him, please.  (Applause.)<br> <br>And Governor Cooper and I were most recently together at the White House highlighting the jobs that have been created under his leadership here in North Carolina through the American Rescue Plan.  So I thank him, of course, for all the action he has taken get folks online. <br> <br>I also want to recognize the leaders of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration for your work advancing our administration&#8217;s efforts to ensure Internet for all.  And thank you to all of the leaders who are here today, including, of course, the advocates and the organizers who have fought so long to connect our communities.<br> <br>So I will begin with a simple and obvious truth: In the 21st century, high-speed Internet is not a luxury, it is a necessity.  (Applause.)  It&#8217;s as basic as is what we have come to accept over generations: how electricity is a necessity.  Same point.<br> <br>Students use the Internet for so many reasons that are in pursuit of their education, including to attend virtual classes.  Workers use the Internet to find jobs and receive training.  Seniors use the Internet to see a doctor without leaving their home. <br> <br>For so many of us, the Internet is an essential part of our daily lives.  And yet, more than 30 million people in our country still do not have access to high-speed Internet.  Think about that.  It&#8217;s a lot of folks.  And millions more cannot afford the cost of a high-speed plan.<br> <br>Every person in our nation, no matter how much they earn, should be able to afford a high-speed Internet plan.<br> <br>So last year, our administration invested $65 billion through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to help connect every household in our country with affordable high-speed Internet and to lower monthly Internet bills for tens of Americans through an initiative that we&#8217;re here to talk about today called the Affordable Connectivity Program.<br> <br>So this program provides working families with up to $30 a month off of their Internet bill or $75 a month for those living on Tribal lands.  And it also gives families a one-time discount of up to $100 to purchase a laptop, a desktop computer, or a tablet &#8212; because an Internet connection is not much good if you don&#8217;t have a way to get online, if you don&#8217;t actually have the technology that allows you to take advantage of the service. <br> <br>So we have been working with Internet service providers to make sure they offer plans for $30 or less a month, which means the vast majority of households eligible for the Affordable Connectivity Program can receive high-speed Internet without paying a dime. <br> <br>So, if you are eligible, or even think you might be eligible &#8212; I’m going to give you a website; everybody get ready.  Write it on you smartphone or pull out a pen and paper.  Please visit &#8212; the website is GetInternet.gov.  GetInternet.gov.  And when you log on there, you can check to see if you qualify, you can find a plan, and you can sign up.<br> <br>The Affordable Connectivity Program has already done so much good.  Today, about 13 million people are enrolled.  And these are students who can now study at their kitchen table instead of in the parking lot of a local fast-food restaurant, which is what so many of our students did, especially during the height of the pandemic &#8212; because, you see, they would take advantage of the Internet accessibility from the fast-food restaurant by sitting in the parking lot.<br> <br>Think about it: The people who will benefit include parents who used to rely on their cell phone data plan to connect the whole family, which can be incredibly expensive.  And now, those families can stream and search and study on Wi-Fi for free.  This includes women who need access to healthcare. <br> <br>Because as many of you know, this is an issue that has been a priority of mine for a long time &#8212; the issue of maternal health.  And our nation is facing a maternal mortality crisis.<br> <br>In fact, Black women are three times as likely to die in our country from pregnancy-related causes.  Native American women are more than twice as likely to die.  Rural women &#8212; women who live in rural America &#8212; are one and a half times more likely to die.<br> <br>And think about it: For many of the women who live in rural communities, they also live in maternal care deserts, which means they lack access to health providers and facilities.<br> <br>But with high-speed Internet connection and through telehealth, these women can access lifesaving maternal care.<br> <br>Among the other 13 million people who have benefited from our program, there are also folks who are the entrepreneurs in our communities; folks who always wanted to start a business online and work from home but could never afford Internet access to do so until now.<br> <br>Here is what it comes down to: We created this program because we know when we connect folks with high-speed Internet, it is also a connection to opportunity &#8212; the opportunity to live a healthier, happier, and more prosperous life and, importantly, more affordable lives.<br> <br>Every month, the Affordable Connectivity Program saves working families over a quarter billion dollars, and it is important for so many reasons, incler- &#8212; including our larger fight to make sure that we do everything &#8212; and the President and I feel very strongly about this &#8212; to bring down the costs for lower &#8212; and lower the costs for working families.<br> <br>So, we expanded the Child Tax Credit, which lifted millions of children out of poverty last year.  And we passed a tax cut<br>to give parents up to $8,000 for childcare so they will have more room in their pockets to buy food and medication and school supplies for their children.  And we are fighting to pass legislation to lower the price of prescription drugs, and healthcare, and childcare, and so much more.<br> <br>Today we are in Charlotte because we need your help.  We know that when we hold events like this, more people sign up.  But it takes the support of leaders like you in this room to sustain that momentum.<br> <br>So, we need your help, and that’s why I’m here to ask you, like Ms. Tiffany &#8212; we’re going to look at her as a role model for this &#8212; to help us spread the word.  Think about it.  Talk to everybody who comes over for Sunday dinner, at Little League games, at work, at school, in your neighborhood.  Talk with folks about what is available to them that they may not otherwise know but can be a huge help for everything that is about their daily lives and obligations.<br> <br>And we need community and faith-based organizations to help people fill out their applications.  There is an application.  It’s not too detailed.  It’s not too complicated.  But folks might need an extra hand, so please offer to help them fill out the application as well.<br> <br>And we need state and local governments to drive enrollment every way they know how.  I know that Governor Cooper is already hard at work on this front.  The partnership between the leaders here today is essential.<br><br>So, again, I am here to ask you to help spread the word to let people know what is available to them.  And like Tiffany’s story, when we see people take advantage of it, we see so much good that is not only about that individual but truly is about their family and the community as a whole.<br> <br>So thank you, all of you, for all that you have done to help connect the people of our nation with a better future.  And I look forward to seeing you all again soon. <br>God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.  Thank you.  (Applause.) <br> <br>END                 1:44 P.M. EDT</p>

<p>As part of the President’s America the Beautiful Initiative, the Biden-Harris Administration today launched an interagency effort, called the Federal Interagency Council on Outdoor Recreation (FICOR), that will work to create more safe, affordable, and equitable opportunities for Americans to get outdoors.</p>



<p>The FICOR – which includes leaders from the Departments of the Interior, Agriculture, Commerce, and Defense – will focus on improving access to nature, expanding outdoor recreation opportunities, and providing the public with improved and more affordable experiences on America’s public lands and waters.</p>



<p>Increasing access to outdoor recreation is one of the six areas of focus outlined in President Biden’s America the Beautiful Initiative. The FICOR will help coordinate policies, facilitate partnerships, and improve implementation on issues such as: &nbsp;</p>

<p>The launch of the FICOR renews and re-energizes a body that was originally created in 2011 but was suspended by the previous administration. Prior to being suspended, the FICOR successfully launched <a href="https://www.recreation.gov/">recreation.gov</a>, helped the <a href="https://www.bea.gov/news/2021/outdoor-recreation-satellite-account-us-and-states-2020">Bureau of Economic Analysis</a> begin tracking outdoor recreation as an economic sector, and worked to establish the <a href="https://www.everykidoutdoors.gov/pass.htm"><em>Every Kid </em><em>Outdoors</em><em> Pass</em></a>.</p>



<p>With outdoor recreation continuing to grow rapidly as an economic sector, including by contributing <a href="https://www.bea.gov/news/2021/outdoor-recreation-satellite-account-us-and-states-2020">1.8 percent of GDP and generating $374.3 billion</a> in economic output, and America&#8217;s parks and public lands experiencing record-level visitation, the Biden-Harris Administration is taking unprecedented steps to expand equitable access to the outdoors and to protect natural, cultural, and historic resources.</p>



<p>In addition to launching the FICOR, the Administration has:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Launched historic investments through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law in the restoration of Federal lands and waters, including by improving availability of and equitable access to outdoor recreation opportunities</strong>.<ul><li>Commerce Secretary Gina M. Raimondo announced funding opportunities from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) $2.96 billion in Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funds to address the climate crisis and strengthen coastal resilience and infrastructure. Over the next five years, NOAA’s targeted investments in the areas of habitat restoration, coastal resilience, and climate data and services will advance ongoing Federal efforts toward building climate resilience. Projects focused on building “Climate Ready Coasts” will invest in natural infrastructure projects that power outdoor recreation along our coasts by restoring coastal habitats, removing marine debris, storing carbon, and creating jobs.</li></ul><ul><li><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/ceq/news-updates/2022/04/11/biden-harris-administration-launches-1-billion-america-the-beautiful-challenge-to-support-and-accelerate-locally-led-conservation-and-restoration-projects/">Established the America the Beautiful Challenge</a>, a $1 billion public-private competitive grant program which funds locally led, voluntary conservation and restoration activities, including the development of outdoor recreation access and workforce development. The <a href="https://www.nfwf.org/programs/america-beautiful-challenge">first round of grants</a> – totaling $85 million – will be released in November 2022.</li></ul><ul><li>The Interior Department announced more than $61 million in grant funding to communities in 26 cities to create new parks and trails, or substantial renovations to existing parks, through the <a href="https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/secretary-haaland-announces-61-million-increase-outdoor-access-urban-spaces">Outdoor Recreation Legacy Partnership</a> program. The program, established in 2014 and supported by the Land and Water Conservation Fund, enables urban communities to create new outdoor recreation spaces, reinvigorate existing parks, and form connections between people and the outdoors in economically underserved communities.</li></ul><ul><li>As the largest Federal provider of water-based outdoor recreation in America, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) is investing $120 million from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Disaster Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2022 to improve recreation facilities across the nation. These investments will promote equitable access to outdoor recreation opportunities and support local communities. USACE recreation areas had 268 million visits in the last fiscal year, resulting in spending that supports approximately 217,000 jobs and generates nearly $14.5 billion for local economies.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Expanded hunting and sport fishing opportunities on National Wildlife Refuge System lands and waters.</strong><ul><li>The U.S. Department of the Interior <a href="https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/interior-department-announces-largest-expansion-fishing-and-hunting-us-fish-and">expanded hunting and fishing access on 2.1 million acres of National Wildlife Refuge System</a> lands and waters in 2021, the largest expansion of outdoor recreation opportunities in recent history. The Department is continuing to explore opportunities to provide additional access to refuge system lands. Hunting, fishing, and other outdoor activities contributed more than $156 billion in economic activity in communities across the United States in 2016, according to the Service’s National Survey of Fishing, Hunting, and Wildlife-Associated Recreation, published every five years. More than 101 million Americans — 40 percent of the U.S. population age 16 and older — pursue wildlife-related recreation, including hunting and fishing.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Focused acquisitions and improvements of Federal lands and waters under the Great American Outdoors Act (GAOA) of 2020, which passed with overwhelming bipartisan support.</strong><ul><li>The U.S. Department of Agriculture <a href="https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2022/06/06/usda-announces-503-million-improve-outdoor-recreation-and">announced more than $503 million in funding</a> for National Forests and Grasslands.

This expansion – the first new unit in the Refuge System for the Biden-Harris Administration – is the culmination of a 20-year, locally-led effort to conserve important big game corridors and recreational areas in the region. The Service worked in partnership with the Trust for Public Land and the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes (CSKT) to purchase the 38,052-acre conservation easement from its continuing owner, Southern Pine Plantations.</li></ul><ul><li>The Bureau of Land Management, the U.S Department of Agriculture&#8217;s Forest Service, and the five Tribes of the Bears Ears Commission <a href="https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/blm-forest-service-and-five-tribes-bears-ears-commission-commit-historic-co-management">formalized their partnership</a> for co-management of the Bears Ears National Monument.

The Rainy River watershed flows north toward the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness and Voyageurs National Park, landscapes renowned for high-quality fishing, wildlife viewing, and recreational opportunities due to the large number of interconnected lakes and pristine water quality. The proposed mineral withdrawal aims to prevent further negative environmental impacts from future mining operations.

<p>TO THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES:</p>



<p>Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, within 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President publishes in the <em>Federal Register</em> and transmits to the Congress a notice stating that the&nbsp;emergency is to continue in effect beyond the anniversary date. &nbsp;In accordance with this provision, I have sent to the <em>Federal Register</em> for publication the enclosed notice stating that the national emergency with respect to significant transnational criminal organizations that was declared in Executive Order&nbsp;13581 of July&nbsp;24, 2011, under which additional steps were&nbsp;taken in Executive Order 13863 of March 15, 2019, is&nbsp;to&nbsp;continue in effect beyond July 24, 2022.</p>



<p>The activities of significant transnational criminal organizations have&nbsp;reached such scope and gravity that they threaten the stability of international political and economic systems. &nbsp;Such&nbsp;organizations are becoming increasingly sophisticated and dangerous to the United States; they are increasingly entrenched in the operations of foreign governments and the international financial system, thereby weakening democratic institutions, degrading the rule of law, and undermining economic markets. &nbsp;These organizations facilitate and aggravate violent civil conflicts and increasingly facilitate the activities of other dangerous persons.</p>



<p>Significant transnational criminal organizations continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United&nbsp;States. &nbsp;Therefore, I&nbsp;have determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency with respect to&nbsp;significant transnational criminal organizations declared in&nbsp;Executive Order 13581.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-right">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.</p>

<p>On July 24, 2011, by Executive Order 13581, the President declared a national emergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 <em>et seq.</em>) to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States constituted by significant transnational criminal organizations.</p>



<p>On March 15, 2019, by Executive Order 13863, the President took additional steps to deal with the national emergency with respect to significant transnational criminal organizations in view of the evolution of these organizations as well as the increasing sophistication of their activities, which threaten international political and economic systems and pose a direct threat to the safety and welfare of the United States and its citizens, and given the ability of these organizations to derive revenue through widespread illegal conduct, including acts of violence and abuse that exhibit a wanton disregard for human life as well as many other crimes enriching and empowering these organizations.</p>



<p>Significant transnational criminal organizations continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.  For these reasons, the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13581 on July 24, 2011, under which additional steps were taken in Executive Order 13863 on March 15, 2019, must continue in effect beyond July 24, 2022.  Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency with respect to significant transnational criminal organizations declared in Executive Order 13581.</p>



<p>This notice shall be published in the <em>Federal&nbsp;Register </em>and transmitted to the Congress.</p>
