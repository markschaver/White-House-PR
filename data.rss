<p class="has-text-align-center">Roosevelt Room</p>



<p>1:39 P.M. EDT</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:  Folks, I want to start by recognizing the remarkable protests that are taking place in Cuba, with the Cuban people demanding their freedom from an authoritarian regime.  And I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ve seen anything like this protest in a long, long time &#8212; if, quite frankly, ever.</p>



<p>The United States stands firmly with the people of Cuba as they assert their universal rights.&nbsp; And we call on the government &#8212; the government of Cuba to refrain from violence or attempts to silence the voice of the people of Cuba.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And we&#8217;re also closely following the developments in Haiti in the wake of the horrific assassination of the President that recently took place.&nbsp; The people of Haiti deserve peace and security, and Haiti&#8217;s political leaders need to come together for the good of their country.</p>



<p>Over the weekend, I dispatched a high-level, expert delegation to assess the situation and to determine where the United States can offer our support.</p>



<p>And finally, as a close neighbor and friend of the people of both Cuba and Haiti, the United States stands ready to continue to provide assistance, and I&#8217;ll have more for you as we move on.</p>



<p>But the purpose of the meeting today is we&#8217;ve convened a group of law enforcement and other community leaders, including mayors of the &#8212; of our cities, one, to thank them for their service because we owe them big time; second, to hear directly from each of them about reducing violent crime and, particularly, gun violence in our communities.</p>



<p>Last month, I met with a similar group to unveil my comprehensive strategy to do just that.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s been &#8212; it&#8217;s been an &#8212; you know, I guess &#8212; I look at the Attorney General &#8212; we&#8217;ve been this a lo- &#8212; at this a long time.&nbsp; A long time.&nbsp; It seems like most of my career I&#8217;ve been dealing with this issue.</p>



<p>While there&#8217;s no &#8220;one-size-fit-all&#8221; approach, we know there are some things that work, and the first of those that work is stemming the flow of firearms used to commit violent crimes.&nbsp; And we&#8217;ve talked &#8212; you and I have talked about this, Mayor, before.</p>



<p>MAYOR BOWSER:&nbsp; Mm-hmm.&nbsp; Absolutely.</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:  And it includes cracking down on holding rogue gun dealers accountable for violating the federal law.  It includes the Justice Department creating five new strike forces to crack down on illegal gun trafficking (inaudible) supplying weapons to cities of New York &#8212; from New York to the Bay Area.</p>



<p>Secondly, it&#8217;s supporting local law enforcement with the federal support they need.&nbsp; Our strategy provides including funding for law enforcement through the American Rescue Plan for states, cities, and to be able to hire police and pay them overtime in order to advance community policing.</p>



<p>Third, our plan invests in community violence and intervention.&nbsp; We &#8212; what we want to do is when we &#8212; we know we utilize trusted community members and encourage more community policing, we can intervene before the violence erupts &#8212; at least that&#8217;s what, I think, consensus and our experience.&nbsp; And community violence intervention programs have shown to reduce crime in some cities by up to 60 percent.</p>



<p>Fourthly, our strategy to fund the other vital services, like mental health and substance abuse disorder programs, job training, and summer job programs.&nbsp; And this is going to help prevent crime and support young people to pick up a paycheck instead of a pistol.</p>



<p>And fifth, our strategy helps formerly incarcerated people successfully reenter society with housing, jobs, and training, and other support that, up to now, have been denied to them.&nbsp; Somebody gets &#8212; gets out of jail right now, after serving their time, they get a bus ticket and 25 bucks, and they end up under the same bridge they left.&nbsp; And we know this will help.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This will make us all safer.&nbsp; The American Rescue Plan funds programs to help get job training, apprenticeships, and work experience so they can gain stability and security and a chance for a better life.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s a lot more to my strategy, but at &#8212; that’s at the core.&nbsp; It&#8217;s about coordinating at a federal, state, and local level.&nbsp; That&#8217;s what, ultimately, we&#8217;re going to talk about today.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We recognize that we have to come together to fulfill the first responsibility of a democracy and to keep each other safe.&nbsp; And that’s what the American people are looking for when it comes to reducing violent crime and gun violence.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I think this group is illustrative of &#8212; of what we need to get put together, and I want to thank them for being here.&nbsp; And I&#8217;m going to look forward to hearing from them because I&#8217;m going to be asking them what they think we should be doing on the federal level.</p>



<p>So, thank you very much.&nbsp; And we&#8217;ll have more to say as we move on.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. President, would you consider changing the embargo on Cuba?&nbsp; Would you consider making any changes to the embargo with Cuba?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you will be ready to change Trump&#8217;s reversal on Cuba, Mr. President?</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; We are going to have more to say about Cuba and Haiti as the week goes on and &#8212; so stay tuned.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">James S. Brady Press Briefing Room</p>



<p>12:52 P.M. EDT</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;Hi, everyone. &nbsp;Happy Monday. &nbsp;Okay, just two items for all of you at the top. &nbsp;</p>



<p>This afternoon, the President will be joined by Attorney General Garland, as well as law enforcement leaders, elected officials, and a community violence intervention expert to discuss his comprehensive plan to reduce gun violence and violent crime. &nbsp;During the meeting, the President will discuss his crime reduction stragedy [sic] &#8212; strategy, which gives cities and states historic funding through the American Rescue Plan and a range of tools they can use to improve public safety in co- &#8212; their communities, including support for community violence intervention programs, summer employment opportunities, and other proven methods to reduce crime. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The President will also highlight his strong support for and partnership with local leaders to work to reduce gun crime in their communities, like the ones joining him today, and he&#8217;ll underscore his commitment to ensuring their state and law enfor- &#8212; local law enforcement have the resources and support they need to hire more police officers and invest in effective and accountable community policing. &nbsp;</p>



<p>And the President will discuss the work the federal government is doing to stem the flow of guns used in crimes, including the administration&#8217;s zero-tolerance policy for dealers who willfully sell guns illegally; the Department of Justice&#8217;s gun trafficking strike forces; as well as previous steps the White House has announced, like cracking down on &#8220;ghost guns,&#8221; which are increasingly used in violent crimes. &nbsp;</p>



<p>One other update: In COVID news, we want to make sure we are lifting up some of the innowative [sic] &#8212; innovative ways that Americans across the country are meeting their communities where they are with the vaccine. &nbsp;We all have a duty to continue making the case for the vaccine to our friends and family. &nbsp;Companies, media, and individuals all can play a special role as trusted messengers to an unvaccinated person by sharing the facts that the vaccines are safe, effective, accessible, and free. &nbsp;Across the country we&#8217;re seeing Americans step up.</p>



<p>So I want to create some updates &#8212; I&#8217;ll give you some updates and lift up some of the innovative ways we are working with &#8212; to reach Americans with the shot. &nbsp;</p>



<p>So, today, I&#8217;m starting with the first example: truck stops. &nbsp;In the last few months, North Dakota, South Carolina, and Iowa all set up vaccine sites for truckers, with the goal of literally meeting these Americans where they are at, in their trucks or out of their trucks. &nbsp;Since then, more than 9,000 truckers have received a vaccine at these pop-up sites. &nbsp;We&#8217;ll provide more updates in the days and weeks ahead. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead, Jonathan. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;Thanks, Jen. &nbsp;Two matters, both overseas. &nbsp;A couple of questions on Haiti first. &nbsp;The delegation that was sent down there &#8212; has anyone remained in Haiti to continue to oversee what&#8217;s happening? &nbsp;Or have &#8212; has there been any commitment to provide security forces to Haiti? &nbsp;And has the U.S. taken any steps to organize, perhaps, emissaries or troops from other countries to help safeguard the situation?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;So, as we announced last week, an interagency delegation, as you noted, was on the ground in Port-au-Prince yesterday and returned home. &nbsp;I&#8217;m not aware of anyone staying from that delegation on the ground. &nbsp;I will check that important detail for you after the briefing. &nbsp;</p>



<p>But while they were there, as we announced in our readout, they worked to get a better understanding of their request for assistance and to offer assistance to law enforcement forces &#8212; the law enforcement process, I should say, on the ground. &nbsp;They met with both the acting prime minister and prime minister-designate, as &#8212; both of those individuals. &nbsp;And they did receive requests while they were there on the ground for additional assistance. &nbsp;</p>



<p>They did also brief the President this morning. &nbsp;He will receive regular briefings, as he does from his national security team, on the events in Haiti, the requests coming in, and how we can help. &nbsp;</p>



<p>What was clear from their visit, also, what that was &#8212; I should say, &#8220;what was not clear&#8221; is what the future of political leadership looks like in the country. &nbsp;And it was a reminder how vital it is for Haiti&#8217;s leaders to come together to chart a united path forward. &nbsp;</p>



<p>So, while we will continue to &#8212; this is just the beginning of our conversations. &nbsp;And we will remain in close touch with law enforcement, with individuals in Haiti, with a range of leaders in Haiti about how we can assist and provide assistance moving forward. &nbsp;I don&#8217;t have any announcements to portray &#8212; to convey to all of you about assistance &#8212; additional assistance today.</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;So, just to clarify, as of right now, the U.S. is not committing to having any sort of presence on the ground in Haiti?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;Well, that&#8217;s not what I conveyed. &nbsp;We had a delegation that went down yesterday; they came back yesterday. &nbsp;They briefed the President this morning, as &#8212; as was &#8212; as we committed to. &nbsp;But I don&#8217;t have any &#8212; what was clear from their trip is that there is a lack of clarity about the future of political leadership. &nbsp;That&#8217;s an important step that the people of Haiti, the different governing leaders of Haiti need to work together to determine a united path forward. &nbsp;And we will remain deeply engaged, as we have been for months prior to the assassination, with individuals in Haiti to provide assistance moving forward. &nbsp;But I don&#8217;t have any new assistance to announce for you at this point in time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;And the other matter for me is on Cuba. &nbsp;The President &#8212; we saw the President&#8217;s statement today about the demonstrations there on the island yesterday. &nbsp;Two questions on that. &nbsp;But why hasn&#8217;t President Biden taken steps to undo some of the things that his predecessor, Donald Trump, did to overturn the overtures made by President Obama? &nbsp;</p>



<p>And then, secondly, we heard there&#8217;s a &#8212; obviously, a great cry yesterday &#8212; or during these protests for vaccines. &nbsp;Has Cuba &#8212; on the list to get vaccines from the United States?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;Well, first, let me say that we have actually provided, over the course of the last several months, a great deal of assistance to Cuba. &nbsp;I just want to note this because I think it&#8217;s important for people to understand. &nbsp;Since, FY- &#8212; since 2009, which is quite some time ago, Congress has directed $20 million in democracy assistance annually. &nbsp;</p>



<p>But even if you look at last year: Last year alone, the U.S. exported $176 million of goods to Cuba. &nbsp;In the first six months of 2021, Cuba imported $123 million worth of chicken from the United States &#8212; just as an example. &nbsp;Obviously, one of the issues that the ind- &#8212; that protesters are justifiably out there in the streets protesting about is hunger, is lack of access to vaccines, et cetera. &nbsp;But we are continuing to provide a range of assistance, which we will continue to do. &nbsp;</p>



<p>I will say, on vaccines, one of the challenges, Jonathan, which you may be familiar with, is that Cuba has not joined COVAX and has indicated they intend to vaccinate their population using the Abdala vaccine, which they&#8217;re &#8212; the Pan American Health Organization has been out there urging Cuban scientists to publish their &#8212; their results in the peer-reviewed literature on this vaccine. &nbsp;</p>



<p>So, in terms of &#8212; COVAX would be a mechanism that we have provided, as you all know, vaccines to a range of countries in the world. &nbsp;We certainly recognize and understand that access to vaccines is one of the issues that a number of individuals in the streets is voicing concern about, but we have to determine what the mechanism would be to work with the Cuban people to get vaccines to them. &nbsp;That&#8217;s something we&#8217;re working through.</p>



<p>Okay. &nbsp;Go ahead, Jeff.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;Jen, just to follow up on Cuba: Can you give us a sense of where the President&#8217;s policy review on Cuba is right now? &nbsp;Do you anticipate making any changes, as Jonathan asked? &nbsp;And where do you see it going from here?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;Well, I will say first &#8212; and I meant to say this in response to Jonathan &#8212; but there&#8217;s every indication that yesterday&#8217;s protests were spontaneous expressions of people who are exhausted with the Cuban government&#8217;s economic mismanagement and repression. &nbsp;And those &#8212; these are protests inspired by the harsh reality of everyday life in Cuba, not people in another country. &nbsp;I&#8217;m saying that because I think there have been a range of accusations out there, as you well know, Jeff.</p>



<p>In terms of our assessment of a future &#8212; our current pol- &#8212; our policy, I should say, it continues to be &#8212; our approach continues to be governed by two principles: First, support for democracy and human rights &#8212; which is going to continue to be at the core of our efforts &#8212; through empowering the Cuban people to determine their own future. &nbsp;Second, Americans, especially Cuban Americans, are the best ambassadors for freedom and prosperity in Cuba. &nbsp;</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t have anything to predict for you in terms of any policy shift. &nbsp;Obviously, given the protests were just happening over the last 24 to 48 hours, we&#8217;re assessing how we can be helpful directly to the people of Cuba in these circumstances.</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;You hinted at this, but the President of Cuba did directly accuse the United States of basically fomenting these protests because of the embargo and that leading to a lack of medicine and the other things. &nbsp;Do you have a specific response to him?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;Well, I&#8217;d first say that the U.S. embargo allows humanitarian goods to reach Cuba. &nbsp;We exidite [sic] &#8212; expedite any request to export humanitarian or med- &#8212; medical supplies to Cuba. &nbsp;That continues to be the case. &nbsp;</p>



<p>And the United States regularly authorizes the export of agricultural products, medicine, medical equipment, and humanitarian goods to Cuba &#8212; and, since 1992, has authorized the export of billions of dollars of those goods to Cuba. &nbsp;</p>



<p>So that&#8217;s simply inaccurate in terms of the facts that are stated. &nbsp;But, again, I would restate what I said a little bit earlier in response, which is that there&#8217;s every indication that yesterday&#8217;s protests were reactions of the people in Cuba to exhaustion of the governance of the &#8212; of the leaders in the state, the economic mismanagement, and the repression that we&#8217;re seeing take place against the people of the country. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;Lastly, there seems to be a disagreement between Pfizer and the U.S. government on the need for booster shots. &nbsp;Do you anticipate getting any clarity on that in this afternoon&#8217;s meeting? &nbsp;And can you just give us a sense of what is at the crux of that disagreement?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;Well, first, this meeting is a meeting that HHS is overseeing, and certainly I would refer you to them for a specific readout of the meeting. &nbsp;But I would say that we don&#8217;t see it as a disagreement per se, but we provide public health information and make determinations based on a large swath of data, and that relates to boosters &#8212; booster shots as well. &nbsp;And some of that information that the FDA and the CDC look at &#8212; and this was in their statement last week &#8212; does include some private-sector data, and that can be part of how they assess what recommendations will be, but it&#8217;s a much broader swath of information and data than that. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, data &#8212; we continue to analyze. &nbsp;Science evolves. &nbsp;And we&#8217;ve long said that we will reserve options &#8212; optionality, including how we&#8217;re purchasing doses of sa- &#8212; vaccines to ensure we have maximum optionality for our own &#8212; the American public. &nbsp;But any assessment would be made by the CDC and the FDA. &nbsp;And we made clear, last week, that wasn&#8217;t a recommendation being made at this time. &nbsp;</p>



<p>I&#8217;d also point to something that Dr. &nbsp;Fauci said yesterday &#8212; when he was out there on some of your networks &#8212; when he conveyed that there could be assessments made about certain swaths of the population as well. &nbsp;</p>



<p>It may not be all or nothing, but that’s something that our scientists will continue to assess. &nbsp;And if they make a conclusion that booster shots are recommended, they will provide that information publicly and it would be based on a large range of data and information.</p>



<p>Go ahead, Karen.</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;Thanks, Jen. &nbsp;I just want to point out that HHS is not commenting on that meeting that’s taking place today with Pfizer. &nbsp;There&#8217;s nothing else you could share ahead of that of how seriously the administration is considering the possibility of booster shots?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;Well, not to minimize the meeting, but I would say that we regularly meet with and engage with health and medical &#8212; our health and medical experts do, I should say &#8212; regularly work and meet with companies to understand the latest data, and that would certainly be a part of an assessment of recommendations moving forward.</p>



<p>The point I was making, in response to Jeff&#8217;s question, was that it&#8217;s not based on, solely, the information or data from one company, which hasn&#8217;t been concluded or hasn&#8217;t been fully published publicly either. &nbsp;So, you know &#8212; but our health and medical experts will look at the data around the vaccine holistically, will use any further data as a consideration moving forward. &nbsp;</p>



<p>But I wouldn&#8217;t see this meeting today &#8212; I&#8217;m not surprised that there&#8217;s not a big readout from HHS, I should say. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;And you mentioned other companies. &nbsp;Has the administration heard from any of the other vaccine producers about the possibility of a booster shot and what they&#8217;re pushing for?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;Again, I would leave that to any company to provide any information publicly about what they&#8217;re assessing. &nbsp;We are in touch with leaders of these companies regularly. &nbsp;We do look at our own data. &nbsp;We welcome their data as a part of that assessment, but we&#8217;ll make &#8212; the CDC and the FDA will make a recommendation based on their own assessment.</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;And just one more quick one. &nbsp;If there is a third shot recommended, would the government cover the cost of that shot as well? &nbsp;And what considerations would have to take place to get funding for that?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;Well, we have, in our &#8212; in our contingency planning, led by Jeff Zients and the COVID team &#8212; I think we&#8217;ve indicated from here that we have purchased the number of doses we have and indicated we want to increase manufacturing in these facilities around the country because we want to have maximum optionality, including &#8212; depending on what is most effective with children under the age of 12 &#8212; including if there is a booster shot needed. &nbsp;</p>



<p>So that is certainly &#8212; has long been in our planning, even &#8212; even in advance of knowing whether that will be a recommendation made by our health experts. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;Thanks, Jen. &nbsp;What can you tell us about the President&#8217;s message in his voting rights speech tomorrow? &nbsp;Is going to be pushing more for congressional action? &nbsp;Is he going to be talking about state action? &nbsp;And what is his strategy to tackle this issue beyond the speech tomorrow?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;Sure. &nbsp;Well, first &#8212; well, thank you for the question, because he&#8217;s very focused on this speech tomorrow &#8212; one that he himself wanted to deliver.</p>



<p>He&#8217;ll lay out the moral case for why denying the right to vote is a form of suppression and a form of silencing. &nbsp;And how he will use &#8212; he will redouble his commitment to using every tool at his disposal to continue to fight to protect the fundamental right of Americans to vote against the onslaught of voter suppression laws, based on a dangerous and discredited conspiracy theory that culminated in an assault on our Capitol. &nbsp;</p>



<p>He’ll call out &#8212; the greatest irony of the Big Lie is that no election in our history has met such a high standard, with over 80 judges, including those appointed by his predecessor, throwing out all challenges.</p>



<p>He&#8217;ll also decry efforts to strip the right to vote as authoritarian and anti-American, as a &#8212; and stand up against the notion that politicians should be allowed to choose their voters or to subvert our system by replacing independent election authorities with partisan ones.</p>



<p>And he will highlight the work of the administration against this, the necessity of passing the For the People Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, and how we need to work together with civil rights organizations to build as broad a turnout and voter education system to overcome the worst challenge to our democracy since the Civil War.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, this is an opportunity for him to make the case to the American people about how this is a fundamental right, what he will continue to do from the federal government. &nbsp;I would remind you, he signed a historic executive order on the 56th anniversary of Selma, which put in place funding measures and a priority from the federal government. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The Department of Justice has already used tools to fight against these laws in states. &nbsp;They will continue to. &nbsp;He&#8217;ll talk about that as well. &nbsp;</p>



<p>But the last piece is he will talk about, also, the importance of empowering, engaging, and supporting efforts around the country to make sure people know their rights and understand how to participate in the process.</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;So it sounds like this is the first of what might be a series of speeches around the country?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;Well, I think he&#8217;s been clear and I think he&#8217;s told all of you that expanding the right to vote, the ac- &#8212; access of people across the country to vote is going to be a fight of his presidency. &nbsp;He&#8217;s asked his Vice President to play a leading role in that effort. &nbsp;He&#8217;ll talk about that as well tomorrow. &nbsp;And he&#8217;ll certainly continue to talk about it out around the country, but I don&#8217;t have anything to preview for you in terms of additional comments or remarks.</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;And then you&#8217;ve said that there&#8217;s going to be a meeting at some point this week between U.S. officials and Russian officials about cybercrimes. &nbsp;When is that meeting taking place? &nbsp;Is it in person or virtual? &nbsp;Who&#8217;s participating? &nbsp;And what&#8217;s the message going to be from White House officials?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;Well, first, there have been ongoing meetings at an expert level and discussions with Russian officials. &nbsp;And the most important thing we can do is preserve a space for those conversations to happen and, hopefully, progress to be made. &nbsp;</p>



<p>So, we&#8217;re not going to be reading out the agenda of these meetings or providing lists of participants. &nbsp;I think it&#8217;s safe to assume that high-level cybersecurity experts and members of our national security team are the appropriate points of contact with their Russian counterparts. &nbsp;But these meetings have been ongoing, as have the discussions, and this is a part of that process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;Thank you, Jen. &nbsp;Does President Biden agree with Dr. Fauci that, at the local level, there should be more vaccine mandates?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;Well, I don&#8217;t have the full context of Dr. Fauci’s comments in front of me. &nbsp;But I will say that &#8212;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;I do have it if you want.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;Oh, go ahead. &nbsp;Let&#8217;s hear it.</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;He said: “I&#8217;ve been of this opinion and I remain of that opinion that I do believe, at the local level, Jake, there should be more mandates. &nbsp;There really should be. &nbsp;We&#8217;re talking about [a] life-and-death situation. &nbsp;We&#8217;ve lost 600,000 Americans already, and we&#8217;re still losing more people.”</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;Well, I would say first, from the federal government, I &#8212; if I remember the context of the question, it was about federal mandates, I believe &#8212; correct me if I&#8217;m wrong. &nbsp;That&#8217;s not a decision that we are making. &nbsp;That&#8217;s not a &#8212; that is not our intention from the federal government. &nbsp;</p>



<p>There will be decisions made by private-sector entities, by universities, by educational institutions, and even perhaps by local leaders, should they decide that is how to keep their community safe. &nbsp;If they decide to make that decision, we certainly support them in that step.</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;The President said, on March 11th, “My message to you is this: Listen to Dr. Fauci.” &nbsp;Is he now saying, “Don&#8217;t listen to Dr. Fauci&#8221; if he doesn’t agree?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;Welcome back.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;Thank you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;I would say that what the &#8212; what Dr. Fauci was conveying is that there will be decisions made by local leaders, just like there will be decisions made by business leaders, by institutional leaders on how they can keep their communities safe, and we support their right to make those decisions.</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;Thank you. &nbsp;And then on Cuba: You&#8217;re talking today about how some of these protests are inspired by people exhausted with the government. &nbsp;Why is it that yesterday the State Department was saying that this was all happening out of concern about rising COVID cases?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;Well, I would say first that the protests were just happening yesterday. &nbsp;We&#8217;re still assessing what is motivating and, of course, is driving all of the individuals who came to the streets. &nbsp;</p>



<p>But we know that when I &#8212; we say “exhaustion,” the &#8212; the manner by which the people of Cuba are governed, that can cover a range of issues, whether it&#8217;s economic suppression; media suppression; lack of access to health and medical supplies, including vaccines. &nbsp;There are a range of reasons and voices we&#8217;re hearing from people on the ground who are protesting.</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;So when these protesters are yelling “freedom” and “enough,” there are people within the administration who think they&#8217;re saying, “freedom from rising COVID cases”?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;Again, I would say that when people are out there in the streets protesting and complaining about the lack of access &#8212; to economic prosperity, to the medical supplies they need, to a life they deserve to live &#8212; that can take on a range of meanings. &nbsp;</p>



<p>There&#8217;s a global pandemic right now. &nbsp;Most people in that country don&#8217;t have access to vaccines. &nbsp;That certainly is something we&#8217;d love to help with.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;A few months ago, when asked about Cuba policy, you said it was not a priority for the President to review U.S. policy toward Cuba. &nbsp;Do the events of this weekend change that?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;Well, I would say, Kelly, that we, of course, are monitoring closely. &nbsp;You saw the &#8212; the statement the President &#8212; we put out in the President&#8217;s name this morning from &#8212; in his voice, of course, conveying his support for the people of Cuba; making clear that he doesn&#8217;t support the approach of the government of Cuba, which he&#8217;s &#8212; he has never held &#8212; he has never been &#8212; held back on.</p>



<p>In terms of where it ranks in a priority order, I&#8217;m not in a position to offer that, but I can tell you that we will be closely engaged. &nbsp;We will be looking to provide support to the people of Cuba. &nbsp;We certainly, you know, support the freedom of speech, the freedom of press, the freedom of &#8212; when we believe they deserve to have access to the economic support and medical support, health supplies that many of them are asking for.</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;And on voting rights: Texas Democrats, who have been working through their process, some of them plan to leave the state, come here. &nbsp;Is there any plan for the President or the political arm of the White House to meet with them? &nbsp;What can you update us on that?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;I don&#8217;t have any &#8212; let me check on that for you, Kelly. &nbsp;It&#8217;s &#8212; and certainly it&#8217;s possible there are people here who plan to meet with them as we have in the past when oth- &#8212; other legislators have come to Washington. &nbsp;So, let me see if there&#8217;s a planned meeting with anyone from our team.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;Back on Haiti for a second &#8212; and sort of honing in on the question that Jonathan was asking: What&#8217;s the status of the formal request that the U.S. send troops to Haiti? &nbsp;Is that still under analysis here? &nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;That&#8217;s correct. &nbsp;It&#8217;s still under review.</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;So it&#8217;s not been ruled out?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;No.</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;What is the current assessment here as to how Haiti ranks in terms of American interests &#8212; safety and security there? &nbsp;How important is safety and security to American interests in the President’s mind?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;Well, certainly, the safety and security of the people of Haiti is of great interest to the President and to the administration. &nbsp;</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s particularly constructive to rank order issues happening around the world. &nbsp;They&#8217;re all important. &nbsp;That&#8217;s why we have a big government and why we are focused on doing what we can to support the people of Haiti, support the people of Cuba, continue to address the range of challenges we have around the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Oh, go ahead.</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;One more question. &nbsp;The President, later today, is going to meeting, as you mentioned, with the officials to talk about gun violence and crime. &nbsp;He did something similar less than three weeks ago. &nbsp;Are we &#8212; should we expect to hear something different today than he has so far said about this issue?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;Well, I would say, first, that rise in crime has been an issue in communities across from the country for 18 months, if not more. &nbsp;It’s cost lives, shattered communities. &nbsp;And our focus is on addressing that head on, saving lives. &nbsp;And he feels it’s important enough to communities around the country to continue to voice what his approach is going to be here: advocating for more police with better training and accountability, then &#8212; advocating for the need to keep illegal guns out of the hands of criminals, making sure people understand we need to use every tool at our disposal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, certainly, today is an opportunity to meet with a number of individuals who have played a role in law enforcement, who have been leaders in their communities &#8212; and certainly should be an indication of his ongoing commitment to this important issue.</p>



<p>Go ahead. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;I wanted to just check in on what the President&#8217;s legislative priority is right now. &nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;Sure.</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;The first: For the reconciliation bill, they need to pass a budget resolution.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;Yeah.</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;Seem to be, still, pretty stark divides between, you know, Bernie Sanders, who&#8217;s running the Budget Committee in the Senate, and some of the more moderate senators. &nbsp;So, I&#8217;m wondering: Has the White House decided on a number that they want for that bill? &nbsp;And if not or if you can&#8217;t express one right now, how confident are you &#8212; since we&#8217;re continuing to see this divide as we get later into July &#8212; that you&#8217;re going to be able to bridge that gap by Leader Schumer’s schedule for this?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;Well, first, you know, back in April, when the President said we would move forward on two tracks &#8212; that we would seek a bipartisan agreement on infrastructure and that we would work with Democrats on a budget reconciliation process that included key components of the American Families Plan &#8212; there was some skepticism about the possibility of that moving forward. &nbsp;And that&#8217;s a diplomatic definition of how the &#8212; the broad reaction was. &nbsp;</p>



<p>That&#8217;s exactly what is happening now. &nbsp;And in our view, this is how the legislative process works. &nbsp;Our policy-making muscles have atrophied over the last few years. &nbsp;This is exactly what it looks like; it&#8217;s messy at times. &nbsp;And we fully expect that these negotiations will have ups and downs. &nbsp;</p>



<p>We&#8217;re prepared for that. &nbsp;We&#8217;re going to be closely engaged. &nbsp;The President will be talking with, engaging with, inviting down members to have discussions as needed through this process. &nbsp;But we&#8217;ve already seen speculation that our agenda was dead be disproved over the last several days. &nbsp;And we&#8217;re going to continue to work in close coordination with members moving forward. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, I will say that, as it relates to the budget reconciliation process: That, of course, is for members of the Senate to work through what they can all collectively support together to get enough votes. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The President will continue to advocate for components of his Build Back Better agenda, the American Families Plan &#8212; components he&#8217;s laid out in his budget &#8212; and pieces of his American Jobs Plan that were not included in the bipartisan package. &nbsp;Those will be his priorities as he&#8217;s having these discussions with Chairman Sanders and others who are leading this process. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;And speaking of the bipartisan bill and maybe some of the messiness, there&#8217;s a meeting tomorrow to sort of hammer out the final details now the Senate is coming back. &nbsp;Is the White House going to be involved in that meeting at all? &nbsp;And what&#8217;s your level of confidence at this point that &#8212; you know, obviously, there were some missteps after the deal was announced that threw it into a bit of peril. &nbsp;How confident are you that this is going to move forward in the next couple days? &nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;We expect there to be some significant ups and downs, but we are ready for it. &nbsp;We&#8217;re bracing for it; we&#8217;re also ready for it. &nbsp;And we&#8217;re going to remain very closely engaged at every level in these discussions. &nbsp;</p>



<p>In terms of this specific meeting, I believe we’ll be directly involved in some level, but I can check and see if there&#8217;s more specificity. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;Are there any meetings between the President and lawmakers this week that you can preview, specifically on this?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;There will be, but I don&#8217;t have anything I can preview in this moment. &nbsp;But we&#8217;ll see if there&#8217;s more we can provide.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead, Kaitlan.</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;In his meeting with civil rights leaders last week on voting rights, did the President make any assurances to them? &nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;The President reiterated to them what you&#8217;ve heard him say many times, which is that he is absolutely committed to signing voting rights legislation into law; that he will work side-by-side with them to advocate not just here in Washington, but around the country for moving this forward; and that it is a top priority for him. &nbsp;</p>



<p>And you heard them go out and speak in front of the White House and convey how constructive they felt the meeting was as well. &nbsp;But there&#8217;s no question that these leaders and their organizations are key partners for the President in our efforts to move this legislation forward.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;And, on Cuba, in this White House statement today you note the, quote, “tragic grip of the pandemic.” &nbsp;But under current U.S. sanctions that were put in place by the last administration but have not been changed by this administration, Cuban exiles cannot send remittances to their family that lives in Cuba. &nbsp;So why is the Biden administration continuing that policy? &nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;Well I would say, again, even under the embargo, there are a number of exemptions, I should say &#8212; humanitarian assistance, medical supplies that we&#8217;ve continued to provide assistance to the people of Cuba, even with that in place. &nbsp;</p>



<p>But I have nothing to preview for you in terms of a change of policy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;But even though the President said he was going to reverse the policy, you can&#8217;t say when he plans to reverse the policy? &nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;Again, these protests happened yesterday, I think, or over the last two days. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;But he made the promise in September.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;I certainly understand, Kaitlan, but there&#8217;s nothing I can preview for you. &nbsp;But to be accurate, there are exemptions that we can send hed- &#8212; medical supplies, we can send humanitarian supplies. &nbsp;That&#8217;s something we&#8217;ve been doing for some time from the U.S. government. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead. &nbsp;Go ahead, Shelby.</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;Yeah, I just had two quick ones. &nbsp;So, first, on Cuba: Recently, the New York Times described the American flag as “alienating to some.” &nbsp;We&#8217;ve seen these Cuban protesters flying the American flag as a symbol for freedom. &nbsp;We saw it in Hong Kong as well. &nbsp;So, does the administration support international protesters flying the American flag? &nbsp;And what message do you have to Americans who are wary of flying it here in the U.S.? &nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;Well, I would say, first, the President certainly values and respects the &#8212; the symbol- &#8212; symbol of the American flag. &nbsp;He&#8217;s someone who certainly waves it outside of his house, or does in Delaware and &#8212; and other places where he&#8217;s lived throughout his time. &nbsp;But he also believes that people have the right to peaceful protest, and he thinks both can be true. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s see. &nbsp;Go ahead. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;So the President&#8217;s meeting today &#8212; I know that the White House has promoted using American Rescue Plan money for hiring more police officers. &nbsp;I&#8217;m curious if there&#8217;s going to be some sort of effort to track whether an increase in police officers leads to a reduction in crime in those communities. &nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;Sure. &nbsp;Well, there are a number of places &#8212; and we noted this; we put out a memo that outlines some of the places where there has been an increase in funding. &nbsp;And certainly, there&#8217;s available data. &nbsp;And we will also look closely at where we&#8217;re seeing an impact. &nbsp;</p>



<p>So, Tu- &#8212; in Tucson, Arizona, they announced a plan to invest at least $7 million in community safety, health, and wellness from the American Rescue Plan. &nbsp;In Walla Walla, Washington, they announced they plan to use funding for help in &#8212; for new police hires. &nbsp;In Utica, New York, they announced plans to support gun violence prevention and law enforcement career recruiting efforts. &nbsp;In Albuquerque, New Mexico &#8212; announced plans to invest $3 million to expand a gunshot detection system, $5 million to refurbish stationhouses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, obviously, there are a range of factors that lead to a reduction in crime, and different communities have different challenges, even if guns are &#8212; gun violence is a big driver in many communities across the country. &nbsp;But we&#8217;ll certainly be working closely with them. &nbsp;</p>



<p>We also have these strike forces that we are working &#8212; engaging with about a half a dozen cities around the country to also engage &#8212; to also reduce illegal guns from being on the streets as well. &nbsp;</p>



<p>And all of these measures &#8212; our hope is that they will lead to a reduction in gun violence and crime in these &#8212; in these cities, of course.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;And on voting rights: What is, I guess, the goal here in terms of giving these speeches, given that there&#8217;s still Republican opposition in the Senate? &nbsp;What does the President hope to accomplish in reaching out and talking to the American people about this issue? &nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;Well, I think the President is a big believer that, you know, as someone who has fought against the odds to get hard things done before, that part of what you need to do is build a grassroots army across the country to engage with, to empower, to inform about what their rights are and what the challenges are. &nbsp;</p>



<p>And one of the reasons he&#8217;s going to speak to how stark this issue is &#8212; how, in &#8212; in dozens of states across the country, there are efforts to put in place restrictive voting measures &#8212; is because he wants people across the country to not just look ahead to 2024, but be prepared and eyes wide open about 2022, and also understand and know their rights and understand what the efforts are to silence them around the country. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;Jen, a follow-up on voting rights?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;Go ahead. &nbsp;Go ahead, April.</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;Following that and looking historically, you&#8217;re talking about an army &#8212; pulling together an army in support of voting rights. &nbsp;Is this akin to what LBJ told Dr. King &#8212; “Go make me do it” &#8212; when he talked to him about voting rights, when they went to Selma? &nbsp;Is this an effort to get the coalitions to go out and force Republicans to change their minds? &nbsp;Is that what you&#8217;re talking about? &nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;Well, as you well know and you alluded to, April, this is not a new struggle; it&#8217;s a 60-year struggle. &nbsp;And the President has been at the forefront of this fight throughout his career, from his work leading the effort to reauthorize the Voting Rights Act, to even the steps he&#8217;s taken as President. &nbsp;</p>



<p>So, obviously, this is a new moment that certainly builds on the challenges over the last 60 years with new challenges, including the swath of restrictive laws that &#8212; that many legislatures &#8212; Republican legislatures &#8212; are attempting to put into law across the country. &nbsp;</p>



<p>So, yes, he is going to be calling on Americans to make sure they are informed, make sure they are informing their neighbors, and make sure they are fighting efforts to pass restrictive laws in their states.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;And on the history piece about Haiti: What is this administration doing, when it goes back to the historic nature with administrations in Haiti? &nbsp;Bill Clinton helped Jean-Bertrand Aristide go back into power. &nbsp;Condi Rice went there during the Bush administration under blue-helmet support from the U.N. to talk about democracy. &nbsp;Is this administration looking at the historic nature of what administrations have done as it relates to Haiti in how you are dealing with Haiti today? &nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;Well, certainly, history is always a part of how you &#8212; any leader approaches governing and approaches engagement with foreign governments, or &#8212; or the people of other countries because sometimes that&#8217;s embedded in how they understand or how they think of the United States.</p>



<p>What&#8217;s important to know and understand is that we are &#8212; have provided $75 million for a wide range of issues, including democratic governance, health, education, agricultural development, and strengthening of pre-election activities even before, of course, last week &#8212; that was as of January &#8212; and that we&#8217;ve long been working with &#8212; directly with &#8212; in lifting up, empowering, and training Haiti&#8217;s law enforcement &#8212; improving, I should say &#8212; Haiti&#8217;s law enforcement capacity.</p>



<p>There &#8212; this is a situation, though, in Haiti where the determination of what the next steps are, what the path forward is going to be up to the people of Haiti. &nbsp;Who is going to be leading the country moving forward? &nbsp;When is it safe to have elections? &nbsp;How will they work together to figure out what their needs are? &nbsp;And how can we work with them to assess what those needs are and how we can help meet them here from the government. &nbsp;So, obviously, there &#8212; from the United States, I should say. &nbsp;</p>



<p>So, obviously, there&#8217;s a great deal of uncertainty. &nbsp;There&#8217;s a lot more information we need. &nbsp;Yesterday was just the beginning &#8212; not the beginning, but an important step in our engagement that will certainly continue from a range of entities in the federal government moving forward. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;Jen, over the weekend, House Whip James Clyburn, an ally of the President&#8217;s, called for a filibuster exemption on voting rights as a potential pathway forward for the Senate to pass that legislation. &nbsp;Does the President agree?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;Well, first, I would say that Congressman Clyburn is a good friend of the President and certainly of the administration &#8212; an important partner as we work to get our agenda moving forward.</p>



<p>I will say, though, in terms of how this works, the filibuster is a legislative process tool &#8212; an important one &#8212; that warrants debate, but determination about making changes will be made by members of the Senate, not by this President or any President, frankly, moving forward. &nbsp;And it requires every single Democrat supporting changes. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, I&#8217;m not here to provide a Whip count for all of you, but that&#8217;s not where support currently stands. &nbsp;So, the President&#8217;s view continues to be aligned with what he has said in the past, which that he has not supported the elimination of the filibuster because it has been used, as often, the other way around. &nbsp;</p>



<p>I understand you&#8217;re asking me about an exemption. &nbsp;We don&#8217;t have any new position on that either. &nbsp;</p>



<p>I would note that there are a lot of issues out there &#8212; and I think activists and advocates will tell you this &#8212; where you could argue that there should be an exemption, and this is certainly one of them. &nbsp;But that is what a lot of advocates &#8212; there are advocates for a range of issues, whether it&#8217;s gun rights, climate, who are out there advocating for this.</p>



<p>So he&#8217;s talked about his support for returning to the talking filibuster; he continues to support that. &nbsp;But he, again, believes that, as somebody who was in the Senate for 36 years, we need to continue to work to find a path forward to do hard things, even when they seem challenging. &nbsp;And that&#8217;s what he will do in this case.</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;So, with no pathway, really, forward, and the legislation languishing, is there a plan B? &nbsp;Is there &#8212; like, is he rallying &#8212; I mean, as he is tomorrow &#8212; public support to hopefully change the complexion of the Senate and then try and pass legislation? &nbsp;It just seems like there&#8217;s no, kind of, obvious path forward for legislation that he says that he wants to pass if he&#8217;s not going to change the filibuster rules or advocate for that. &nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;Well, I think &#8212; you know, if you look at even the Supreme Court ruling just a few weeks ago, his view is that &#8212; and he&#8217;ll talk about this tomorrow &#8212; is that that sends the focus back to Congress. &nbsp;And we don&#8217;t accept the notion &#8212; and he&#8217;s an optimist by nature; otherwise, he wouldn&#8217;t be sitting in the Oval Office right now &#8212; that it&#8217;s dead. &nbsp;We don&#8217;t accept that. &nbsp;</p>



<p>We believe there needs to be a path forward. &nbsp;He&#8217;s going to ask the Vice President to help play an important role in determining what that looks like. &nbsp;And we&#8217;re going to continue to advocate, to fight for moving forward on voting rights legislation. &nbsp;And he&#8217;ll certainly elevate the need for the American people to be engaged in that effort moving forward.</p>



<p>Go ahead. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;Jen, we have an out in a minute, if you want to do, like, one more maybe.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;Oh, okay. &nbsp;Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;Thank you, Jen.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;Oh, well, I was going to go to you, if that&#8217;s okay, only because she hasn&#8217;t been here in a while. &nbsp;Go ahead. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;Okay, thanks. &nbsp;Just to follow up on Matt &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;Sure. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;Clyburn was saying that he would like Biden to endorse the carveout either publicly or privately. &nbsp;Like, get on the phone with Machin &#8212; just call him, say that you&#8217;d like to do this.</p>



<p>To bring up LBJ again, as April said, does the President see no role for himself in trying to press these lawmakers, given you say he&#8217;s going to talk about the authoritarian danger of these voting rights? &nbsp;Does he not see that role for himself?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;I think the President sees his role as somebody who can speak from the bully pulpit to elevate and advocate for the need to move forward on voting rights legislation, of course, but also to use every lever in the federal government to protect the rights of the American people to &#8212; to vote around the country. &nbsp;</p>



<p>That is one lever &#8212; is legislation. &nbsp;There are other levers that are at his disposal that we&#8217;ve already started to implement and rely on. &nbsp;And I would just go back to what I said a little bit earlier is that, you know, if it were that &#8212; if it were waving a magic wand to get voting rights legislation on his desk through ever- &#8212; any means, he would do that. &nbsp;But it requires the majority of members in the Senate to support changes to the filibuster. &nbsp;It requires &#8212;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;But what about arm-twisting? &nbsp;I mean, you say a magic wand, but &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;It requires &#8212; again, I&#8217;ll leave it to &#8212; I&#8217;ll leave it to all of you to do a Whip count out there about the support. &nbsp;This is a Senate procedural process. &nbsp;It requires the majority of them to support it.</p>



<p>What he can do as President is to continue to lift up, elevate, advocate, engage, empower people across the country; make sure they understand that this is based on the Big Lie; &nbsp;make sure they are as outraged as he is about efforts around the country to suppress and silence people across the country. &nbsp;That&#8217;s the most instructive role he can play.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m sorry, you &#8212; I&#8217;ve got to go because we&#8217;ve got to &#8212; you&#8217;ve got to gather. &nbsp;Thanks, everyone. &nbsp;We&#8217;ll see you all tomorrow.</p>

<p>We stand with the Cuban people and their clarion call for freedom and relief from the tragic grip of the pandemic and from the decades of repression and economic suffering to which they have been subjected by Cuba&#8217;s authoritarian regime. The Cuban people are bravely asserting fundamental and universal rights. Those rights, including the right of peaceful protest and the right to freely determine their own future, must be respected. The United States calls on the Cuban regime to hear their people and serve their needs at this vital moment rather than enriching themselves.</p>

<p>On July 11, a United States interagency delegation with representatives from the Department of Justice, Department of Homeland Security, Department of State, and National Security Council traveled to Haiti in response to the Haitian government’s request for security and investigative assistance following the July 7 assassination of Haitian President Jovenel Moïse. The delegation reviewed the security of critical infrastructure with Haitian government officials and met with the Haitian National Police, who are leading the investigation into the assassination. The delegation also met with Acting Prime Minister Claude Joseph and Prime Minister-Designate Ariel Henry in a joint meeting, as well as Senate President Joseph Lambert, to encourage open and constructive dialogue to reach a political accord that can enable the country to hold free and fair elections. In all their meetings the delegation committed to supporting the Haitian government as it seeks justice in this case and affirmed the United States’ support for the people of Haiti in this challenging time. The United States stands with Haiti in becoming a safer, more democratic country. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Joint Base Andrews</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Prince George’s County, Maryland</p>



<p>3:15 P.M. EDT</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. President, does it make sense to attack the servers that are used in Russia to carry out &#8212;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; (Inaudible.)</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does it make sense to attack the servers that are used to carry out these ransom attacks in Russia?</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; To attack them?</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well &#8212;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Well, what happened was there was one company that got &#8212; I mean, they weren&#8217;t specifically attacking servers; they were attacking businesses.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean the U.S. response.&nbsp; Up until now, the U.S. response has been to exercise sanctions &#8212; impose sanctions on Russia for this malign activity.&nbsp; Does it make sense for the U.S. to take it up a notch and attack the actual servers that are used?</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Yes.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, what are the consequences for Putin if he does not step up against cyberattacks?</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Well, we set up a committee &#8212; joint committee.&nbsp; They’re meeting on, I think, the 16th.&nbsp; And I believe we’re going to get some cooperation.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. President, what do you expect President Putin (inaudible) &#8212; what do you expect him to do?&nbsp; What are those actions?</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; It’s not appropriate for me to say what I expect him to do now.&nbsp; But we’ll see.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Via Teleconference</p>



<p>3:25 P.M. EDT</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MODERATOR:&nbsp; Good afternoon, everyone.&nbsp; Today&#8217;s call is going to be on background, attributed to a “senior administration official,” and the contents are going to be embargoed until the conclusion of the call.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With that, we&#8217;ll turn it over to our speaker, [senior administration official].&nbsp; [Senior administration official], over to you.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; And thanks, everybody, for being here.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were two main topics, obviously, in the President&#8217;s call today with President Putin.&nbsp; First, Syria &#8212; which I really want to underscore because I think it deserves some attention.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I really &#8212; the leaders commended the work of their respective teams following the U.S.-Russia summit that led to today&#8217;s unanimous renewal of cross-border humanitarian assistance to Syria in the U.N. Security Council.&nbsp; And I genuinely encourage you to reach out to NGOs and other humanitarian organizations about the impact of this.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For months, we&#8217;ve been concerned about the likelihood, if not a near certainty, of a Russian veto of the U.N. Security Council resolution that allows for humanitarian assistance to be provided across the Syrian border from Turkey.&nbsp; And it is our strong sense that only leader-level engagement along the lines that took place at the summit in Geneva would have gotten this extension done and this access secured at a time of severe humanitarian distress and need in Syria.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, we think that&#8217;s quite a consequential action and a genuine impact of the President&#8217;s personal engagement and of the summit.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; President Biden also spoke with President Putin, obviously, about the ongoing ransomware attacks by criminals based in Russia that have impacted the United States and other countries around the world.&nbsp; President Biden underscored the need for Russia to take action to disrupt ransomware groups operating on Russian territory, and emphasized that he&#8217;s committed to continued engagements on the broader threat posed by ransomware.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The President believes strongly in this leader-level engagement on this issue as well.&nbsp; And we engage in this type of diplomacy not because we agree often or all the time, but precisely because we have these disagreements in so many areas, including this one.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; President Biden reiterated that the United States will take necessary action to defend its people and its critical infrastructure in the face of this continuing challenge.&nbsp; And the President has also called on governments and agencies to modernize their defenses to meet this threat, building on the President&#8217;s executive order on cybersecurity that was released in May.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to say a few other things about this: The President really meant what he said just after concluding the summit meeting in Geneva, when he said that our assessment of this process and our evaluation of Russia&#8217;s actions would take time and play out over time.&nbsp; The President said six months or more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is more than just a conversation that’s taking place between the two leaders, President Biden and President Putin.&nbsp; This is really about our own resilience, as a nation, in the face of these attacks, and strengthening that.&nbsp; That&#8217;s what the cybersecurity executive order was largely about.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s about addressing the challenges posed by cryptocurrency, which provides fuel for these sorts of transactions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s about ensuring that our allies and our partners are working with us, collaboratively, and upping their own game when it comes to resilience and these broader issues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, this is a broad campaign and won&#8217;t have an immediate on-off effect like a light switch, but we’re going to have to stay on top of this over a period of time and remain focused on it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, with that, [senior administration official], I’m happy to take whatever questions there are.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Syria, you mentioned we should call NGO groups, and we have.&nbsp; And they say that this isn&#8217;t good enough, that six-month extension; even if there&#8217;s no requirement for another vote &#8212; in six months, it’s just not long enough to plan for humanitarian groups.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Human Rights Watch said that Russia successfully blackmailed the international community.&nbsp; Amnesty said Russia continues to play games with the lives and welfare of millions of people.&nbsp; So how do you paint this as a success if these groups are saying it&#8217;s not?&nbsp;</p>



<p>And on cyber, the U.S. has given Russia information on the people it wants arrested.&nbsp; Assuming Russia has not made those arrests, how is it that you can expect Russian action when you&#8217;ve asked for those actions and they haven&#8217;t been taken?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Thank, Nick.&nbsp; So, first of all, this was a 15 to 0 vote in the Security Council, broadly, strongly believed by the United States and our closest allies that this was a big step forward on the humanitarian front.&nbsp; And the groups that we&#8217;ve been in touch with have a different impression from the ones that you&#8217;ve just quoted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We see the six-month extension with a virtually automatic additional six months.&nbsp; In other words, adding up to a full-year extension of humanitarian access is being far better than what was expected in recent months and consider this to be a significant progress on the humanitarian issues.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re going to have to stay on top of them, obviously.</p>



<p>On Russia’s follow-up actions: Look, you know, time will tell.&nbsp; The President was quite clear that part of why he wanted to gauge what President Putin was willing to do with regard to these actions that have taken place from Russian territory was so the United States could gauge what we&#8217;re going to be willing to do.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I think the President was asked today if he expected us, the United States, to take action, to follow up.&nbsp; He said, “Yes.”&nbsp; We&#8217;re not going to telegraph what those actions will be precisely.&nbsp; Some of them will be manifest and visible, some of them may not be.&nbsp; But we expect those to take place, you know, in the days and weeks ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi there.&nbsp; Thank you for doing this.&nbsp; What did Russia get in exchange for not voting to close the crossing into Syria?</p>



<p>And as far as the timing, did the administration wait until Russia did vote that way before making this, kind of, more punitive call on ransomware?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; So, on your second question: No &#8212; I mean, I think the timing of these two topics was more coincidental than linked.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t think we linked these issues in any way.</p>



<p>On your first question, I guess I would refer you to the Russian government to explain its rationale and its calculus for this vote.&nbsp; I mean, for our purposes, you know, what we were concerned about was the continued, sustained, and ideally enhanced flow of humanitarian assistance into all parts of Syria, and we think that&#8217;s what this has accomplished.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey, this is actually Rachel Scott with ABC.&nbsp; We&#8217;re just in the booth together.&nbsp; Thanks so much for taking my question.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The President was just asked (inaudible) servers that are used to carry out ransomware hacks.&nbsp; So, my first question is: Has the President already directed officials to do that?&nbsp;</p>



<p>And just another follow-up question.&nbsp; We just got a readout from the Kremlin.&nbsp; They say that they&#8217;ve received no formal request to assist in dealing with the attacks from U.S. agencies.&nbsp; What is the administration&#8217;s response to that?&nbsp; Is there any indication that they&#8217;re taking (inaudible) this morning?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Sorry.&nbsp; Can &#8212; the very first part of your question got garbled.&nbsp; Has the President directed agencies and departments to do what specifically, did you ask?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; (Inaudible) now, given &#8212;</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; You&#8217;re still &#8212; you&#8217;re still really breaking up, so &#8212; I’m sorry.&nbsp; I&#8217;m &#8212; maybe, Operator, you can hear this, but I can&#8217;t.</p>



<p>OPERATOR:&nbsp; It&#8217;s breaking up on my end as well.&nbsp; Molly, can you hear us?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you hear me?</p>



<p>OPERTATOR:&nbsp; Your line was breaking up.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah, I can &#8212; I&#8217;ll ask it again.&nbsp; I’m walking out of the booth.&nbsp; Sorry, stick with me (inaudible).</p>



<p>So, the President was just asked on the tarmac if it makes sense to attack the servers that are used to carry out the ransomware hacks.&nbsp; The President said, “Yes.”&nbsp; So, my question is: Has he &#8212; has he planned to direct &#8212; have you already directed any officials to carry out that action?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; So &#8212; okay, I guess I&#8217;ll take the two parts of your question.&nbsp; On the first question, that&#8217;s obviously not something that we would speak to publicly, in terms of any specific actions the President has or hasn&#8217;t ordered.&nbsp; So I just won&#8217;t speak to those operational questions in detail.</p>



<p>On your second question about the Kremlin&#8217;s readout, I guess what I can say is that we have relayed multiple specific requests for action on cybercriminals to Russia through official channels and been clear about what Russia&#8217;s responsibility is with regard to taking action, including, again, today, at the level of the two presidents.&nbsp; And I’ll just leave it at that.</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Hey, everyone.&nbsp; This is [senior administration officials].&nbsp; Just on that &#8212; on that first part of that last question, I would encourage folks to go back and look at the full official transcript of what the President said earlier.&nbsp; I think that there might be a bit of a garble there, but folks should be checking the transcript, please.</p>



<p>With that, I&#8217;m afraid that we&#8217;re out of time, and we have to get our speaker to his next meeting.&nbsp; Thanks, everyone, for joining, and have a good rest of your afternoon.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3:36 P.M. EDT</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">State Dining&nbsp;Room&nbsp;</p>



<p>1:48&nbsp;P.M. EDT&nbsp;</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Hello, everyone.&nbsp; They have a Cabinet meeting.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Please &#8212; please be seated.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>Well, it is not “good morning,” which my remarks say here, but &#8212; (laughter) &#8212; good afternoon.&nbsp; We&#8217;re in the midst of a historic economic recovery.&nbsp; And because our successful vaccination program strategy has been working and the immediate relief through the American Rescue Plan has brought back our economy from the worst economic crisis in nearly a century, America is now on track.&nbsp; We&#8217;re now on track for the highest economic growth in 40 years and among the highest growth records on record.</p>



<p>We designed our ecomi- &#8212; our economic strategy to be durable through the ups and downs that come with recovery.&nbsp; And there are ups and downs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That&#8217;s why the American Rescue Plan was designed to help people not just all at once, but over the course of a full year so we could continue supporting families, small businesses, state and local budgets to help them weather those ups and downs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And now that the economy is back on track, we&#8217;re making progress on the second phase of our strategy: ensuring long-term growth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That&#8217;s what my Build Back Better agenda, including my Americans Family Plan and the bipartisan infrastructure agreement we reached last month &#8212; that&#8217;s what they&#8217;re all about: long term.</p>



<p>But to keep our country moving, we have to take another step as well &#8212; and I know you&#8217;re all tired of hearing me during the campaign and since I&#8217;m elected President talk about it &#8212; and that&#8217;s bringing fair competition back to the economy.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s why today I&#8217;m going to be signing shortly an executive order promoting competition to lower price &#8212; to lower prices, to increase wages, and to take another critical step toward an economy that works for everybody.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The heart of American capitalism is a simple idea: open and fair competition &#8212; that means that if your companies want to win your business, they have to go out and they have to up their game; better prices and services; new ideas and products.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That competition keeps the economy moving and keeps it growing.&nbsp; Fair competition is why capitalism has been the world&#8217;s greatest force for prosperity and growth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By the same token, “competitive economy” means companies must do all they do to do &#8212; everything they do to compete for workers: offering higher wages, more flexible hours, better benefits.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But what we&#8217;ve seen over the past few decades is less competition and more concentration that holds our economy back.&nbsp; We see it in big agriculture, in big tech, in big pharma.&nbsp; The list goes on.</p>



<p>Rather than competing for consumers, they are consuming their competitors.&nbsp; Rather than competing for workers, they&#8217;re finding ways to gain the upper hand on labor.&nbsp; And too often, the government has actually made it harder for new companies to break in and compete.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Look at what that means for family budgets.&nbsp; Take prescription drugs: Just a handful of companies control the market for many vital medicines, giving them leverage over everyone else to charge whatever they want.&nbsp; As a result, Americans pay two and a half times more for prescription drugs than in any other leading country.&nbsp; And nearly one in four Americans struggles to afford their medication.</p>



<p>Another example: hearing aids.&nbsp; Right now, if you need a hearing aid, you can&#8217;t just walk into a pharmacy and pick one up over the counter.&nbsp; You have to get it from a doctor or a specialist.&nbsp; Not only does that make getting hearing aids inconvenient, it makes them considerably more expensive, and it makes it harder for new companies to compete, innovate, and sell hearing aids at lower prices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a result, a pair &#8212; a pair of hea- &#8212; a pair of hearing aids can cost thousands of dollars.&nbsp; That&#8217;s a big reason why just one in seven Americans with hearing loss actually use a hearing aid.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another example: Internet services.&nbsp; There are more than 65 million Americans who live in a place with only one high-speed Internet provider.&nbsp; Research shows, when you have unlimited Internet operation, you pay up to five times more on average than families in places with more choices.&nbsp; That&#8217;s what a lack of competition does: it raises the prices you pay.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And it&#8217;s not just consumers getting hurt.&nbsp; Big ag is putting a squeeze on farmers.&nbsp; Small and family farms, first-time farmers &#8212; like veterans coming home and Black and Latino and Indigenous farmers &#8212; they&#8217;re seeing price hikes for seed, lopsided contracts, shrinking profits, and growing debt.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lack of competition hurts workers as well.&nbsp; In many communities, there are only a handful of employers left competing for workers.&nbsp; Think of company towns across Appalachia and other parts of the country where one big corporation runs the show.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When corporations have that kind of leverage over workers, it pushes down aver- &#8212; it pushes down advertised wages by up to 17 percent.&nbsp; And as competition decreases, businesses don&#8217;t feel the pressure to innovate or invest in their workforce.&nbsp; That hurts working families and it hurts our economy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All told, between rising prices and lowering wages, lack of competition costs the median American household $5,000 a year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, look, I&#8217;m a proud capitalist.&nbsp; I spent most of my career representing the corporate state of Delaware.&nbsp; I know America can’t succeed unless American business succeeds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But let me be very clear: Capitalism without competition isn&#8217;t capitalism; it’s exploitation.&nbsp; Without healthy competition, big players can change and charge whatever they want and treat you however they want.&nbsp; And for too many Americans, that means accepting a bad deal for things that can&#8217;t go &#8212; you can&#8217;t go without.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, we know we&#8217;ve got a problem &#8212; a major problem.&nbsp; But we also have an incredible opportunity.&nbsp; We can bring back more competition to more of the country, helping entrepreneurs and small businesses get in the game, helping workers get a better deal, helping families save money every month.&nbsp; The good news is: We&#8217;ve done it before.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the early 1900s, President Teddy Roosevelt saw an economy dominated by giants like Standard Oil and JP Morgan&#8217;s railroads.&nbsp; He took them on, and he won.&nbsp; And he gave the little guy a fighting chance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Decades later, during the Great Depression, his cousin Franklin Roosevelt saw a wave of corporate mergers that wiped out sec- &#8212; scores of small businesses, crushing competition and innovation.&nbsp; So he ramped up antitrust enforcement eightfold in just two years, saving families billions in today&#8217;s dollars and helping to set the course for sustained economic growth after World War Two.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He also called for an economic bill of rights, including, quote, “the right of every businessman, large and small, to trade in an atmosphere of freedom from unfair competition and domination by monopolies.”&nbsp; End of quote.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Between them, the two Roosevelts established an American tradition &#8212; an antitrust tradition.&nbsp; It is how we ensure that our economy isn&#8217;t about people working for capitalism; it&#8217;s about capitalism working for people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, over time, we&#8217;ve lost the fundamental American idea that true capitalism depends on fair and open competition.&nbsp; Forty years ago, we chose the wrong path, in my view, following the misguided philosophy of people like Robert Bork, and pulled back on enforcing laws to promote competition.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We&#8217;re now 40 years into the experiment of letting giant corporations accumulate more and more power.&nbsp; And where- &#8212; what have we gotten from it?&nbsp; Less growth, weakened investment, fewer small businesses.&nbsp; Too many Americans who feel left behind.&nbsp; Too many people who are poorer than their parents.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe the experiment failed.&nbsp; We have to get back to an economy that grows from the bottom up and the middle out.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The executive order I&#8217;m soon going to be signing commits the federal government to full and aggressive enforcement of our antitrust laws.&nbsp; No more tolerance for abusive actions by monopolies.&nbsp; No more bad mergers that lead to mass layoffs, higher prices, fewer options for workers and consumers alike.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My executive order includes 72 specific actions.&nbsp; I expect the federal agencies &#8212; and they know this &#8212; to help restore competition so that we have lower prices, higher wages, more money, more options, and more convenience for the American people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, I want to focus on three specific actions:&nbsp;</p>



<p>First, the FDA &#8212; the Food and Drug Administration &#8212; are going to work with states and Tribes to safely import prescription drugs from Canada.&nbsp; That&#8217;s just one of many actions in the executive order that will lower prescription drug prices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, the FDA is going to issue rules so that hearing aids can be sold over the counter.&nbsp; That&#8217;s something the last administration was supposed to have done but didn&#8217;t do.&nbsp; We&#8217;re going to get it done.&nbsp; After these rules go into effect, a pair of hearing aids can cost hundreds of dollars, not thousands.&nbsp; And you&#8217;ll be able to pick them up at your local drugstore.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, we&#8217;re going to improve competition for workers.&nbsp; I’ve talked a lot about non-compete agreements &#8212; contracts that say you can&#8217;t take another job in your field, even if you get a better deal.&nbsp; I made a speech &#8212; I was just reminiscing with my staff &#8212; back in 2018, at the Brookings Institution, where I talked about the non-compete clauses that were just &#8212; I found &#8212; to be absolutely ridiculous, but how prevalent they were throughout industries.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At least one in three businesses require their workers to sign a non-compete agreement.&nbsp; These aren’t just high-paid executives or scientists who hold secret formulas for Coca-Cola so Pepsi can’t get their hands on it.&nbsp; A recent study found one in five workers without a college education is subject to non-compete agreements.&nbsp; They’re construction workers, hotel workers, disproportionately women and women of color.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Think of the 26-year-old employee at a company.&nbsp; She’s a star worker, but she isn&#8217;t being treated right.&nbsp; She&#8217;s underpaid, passed over for promotions.&nbsp; A competitor across the street knows and wants to bring her in at a higher wage, but she can’t do it.&nbsp; Her company threatens legal action over a non-compete clause she had to sign in order to get hired in the first place.&nbsp; She can&#8217;t afford a lawyer for help, so she’s locked in.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Imagine if you’re in her shoes.&nbsp; You’d feel powerless, disrespected, bullied, trapped.&nbsp; That&#8217;s not right.&nbsp; Workers should be free to take a better job if someone offers it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If your employer wants to keep you, he or she should have to make it worth your while to stay.&nbsp; That&#8217;s the kind of competition that leads to better wages and greater dignity of work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Look, I&#8217;m not going to go into it now, but I used to talk about, you know, there&#8217;s non-compete clauses of people running the machines that lay down asphalt.&nbsp; If, in fact, you get offered a job and you have a &#8212; you know, you&#8217;re in Arkansas doing it, a lot of &#8212; a specific example is you can’t take a job in west Texas to do it.&nbsp; What in the hell does that have to do with anything?&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; No, I’m serious.&nbsp; Or there were clauses in McDonald&#8217;s contracts: You can&#8217;t leave Burger King to go to McDonald&#8217;s.&nbsp; Come on.&nbsp; Is there a trade secret about what&#8217;s inside that patty?&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; No, but I’m serious.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You all &#8212; I don&#8217;t know if you do know; I didn&#8217;t know it until five years ago &#8212; the incredible number of non-compete clauses for ordinary people who &#8212; it was done for one reason: to keep wages low.&nbsp; Period.</p>



<p>Look, my executive order calls on the FTC to ban or limit non-compete agreements.&nbsp; Let workers chose who they want to work for.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I’m also calling on the FTC to do away with certain occupational licensing requirements.&nbsp; You realize, if you want to braid hair and you move from one state to another, sometimes you have to do a six-month apprenticeship, even though you’ve been in the business for a long, long time?&nbsp; What the hell &#8212; what’s that all about?</p>



<p>Military families, for example, they’re often on the move between states with each new assignment.&nbsp; So you have a woman in the military, her husband is following her, or vice versa.&nbsp; Guess what?&nbsp; If you have &#8212; if you’re a plumber, you have to get a different license when you move from Delaware to Missouri.</p>



<p>Look, it can&#8217;t be a significant burden to get a new license in a new home state.&nbsp; That burden can&#8217;t be around anymore.&nbsp; It takes time and it takes money.&nbsp; It takes a toll on a family’s income while you&#8217;re waiting.&nbsp; We should remove that barrier, providing more mobility, more opportunity, higher wages for families on the move.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is something that my wife, Jill, has worked on together with Michelle Obama through the Joining Forces initiative for the military.</p>



<p>We’re going to keep that moving.&nbsp; We’re going to get it done in an executive order.</p>



<p>Let me close with this: Competition works.&nbsp; We know it works.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve seen it works when it exists.&nbsp; Fair competition is was what made America the wealthiest, most innovative nation in history.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why people come here to invent things and start new businesses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the competition against China and other nations of the 21st century, let&#8217;s show that American democracy and the American people can truly outcompete anyone.&nbsp; Because I know that just given half a chance, the American people will never, ever, ever let their country down.&nbsp; Imagine if we give everyone a full and fair chance.&nbsp; That’s what this is all about.&nbsp; That’s what I’m about to do.</p>



<p>So I’d like to invite the Cabinet members up here.&nbsp; I’d like to &#8212; and the Attorney General is here &#8212; Attorney General Garland.&nbsp; Xavier &#8212; Mr. Secretary, you can come up too.&nbsp; I’ve been watching on television; you’ve been really good.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Gina Raimondo.&nbsp; Also, Pete Buttigieg.&nbsp; And the chair of the <s>FCC</s> [FTC], Lian [sic] &#8212; excuse me, Lina Khan, Acting Chair of the FTC.&nbsp; And Director of the National Economic Council.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Am I leaving anybody out?&nbsp; Anyway, come on up.&nbsp; This may be the first Cabinet meeting we’ve had.</p>



<p>Okay.&nbsp; “Promoting Competition in the American Economy.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>First pen.&nbsp; (Laughter.) &nbsp;Second pen.&nbsp; Third.&nbsp; Fourth.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Fifth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I’m wondering how Barack did this with a shorter name.&nbsp; (Laughter.)</p>



<p>(The executive order is signed.)</p>



<p>Thank you.&nbsp; Thank you, everyone.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. President, how did President Putin respond to your call today, sir?</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Well, I made it very clear to him that &#8212; that the United States expects, when a ransomware operation is coming from his soil, even though it’s not &#8212; not sponsored by the state, we expect them to act if we give them enough information to act on who that is.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, secondly, that we have set up a means of communications now, on a regular basis, to be able to communicate to one another when each of us thinks something is happening in another country that affects the home country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so, it went well.&nbsp; I’m optimistic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You said, three weeks ago, there would be consequences.&nbsp; Will there be, sir?</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Yes.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">James S. Brady Press Briefing Room</p>



<p>12:50 P.M. EDT</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Hi, everyone.&nbsp; Happy Friday.&nbsp; I have a couple of items for all of you at the top.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, we welcome the unanimous adoption today in the U.N. Security Council to extend the mandate for a critical humanitarian aid lifeline to Syria.&nbsp; This agreement, which will directly impact the lives of millions of Syrians, was the result of hard work among the members of the Council and intensive diplomacy following a detailed discussion at the Geneva summit between President Biden and President Putin.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today’s resolution, which renews the cross-border agreement that would have expired on July 10th, will provide further lifesaving humanitarian assistance to the people of northwest Syria and is part of a broader humanitarian initiative led by the United Nations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The two leaders, today, on their call &#8212; there was a readout that just went out that should be in your inboxes, you may have seen &#8212; commended the work of their respective teams following the summit and welcomed the unanimous vote in the Council.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a readout, I should note, that just went out, of a call that President Biden did with President Putin this morning.&nbsp; I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll talk more about that.&nbsp; But just to note for all of your inboxes.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, today, the President will sign an executive order that will direct a historic whole-of-government effort to promote competition in the American economy.&nbsp; This effort has three goals: lower prices for consumers, higher wages for workers, and more innovation and economic growth.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lack of competition drives up prices for consumers.&nbsp; Barriers to competition also drive down wages for workers.&nbsp; When there are only a few employers in town, workers have less opportunity to bargain for a higher wage and to demand dignity and respect.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In total, higher prices and lower wages caused by lack of competition are now estimated to cost the median American household $5,000 per year, so we want to work to address that.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Competition is the engine of our economy.&nbsp; And this is just the beginning.&nbsp; We&#8217;ll be back, in the weeks ahead, to update you on the progress we&#8217;re making on this executive order and the concrete benefits we are delivering to the American people.</p>



<p>     I also wanted to provide a quick update for you on our work in Haiti.  The United States remains engaged and in close consultations with our Haitian and international partners to support the Haitian people in the aftermath of the assassination of the president.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In response to the Haitian government’s request for security and investigative assistance, we will be sending senior FBI and DHS officials to Port-au-Prince as soon as possible to assess the situation and how we may be able to assist.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also wanted to note that in January of 2021, we announced a $75.5 million for a wide range of issues, including democratic governance, health, education, agricultural development, and strengthening of pre-election activities.&nbsp; Strengthening Haiti&#8217;s law enforcement capacity is a key U.S. priority &#8212; was before the assassination a few days ago, continues to be.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the U.S. Department of State&#8217;s Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs provides assistance directly to the Haitian National Police.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are also providing $5 million to strengthen the Haitian National Police capacity to work with communities to resist gangs.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also wanted to remind you all that, earlier this year, the Department of Homeland Security re-designated Temporary Protected Status for Haiti for 18 months &#8212; something the Secretary announced in May and something we are working to implement.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And finally, Haiti is one of the countries that is &#8212; will be receiving vaccines from the United States.&nbsp; We will be prepared to deliver those, hopefully as early as next week.&nbsp; Part of that is assessing what the airport &#8212; what can happen with the airport and how we will be able to deliver these.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sorry, one other &#8212; two other updates.&nbsp; One other update and the week ahead.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On global vaccines, today we are sending 3 million doses to Indonesia, 1.5 million doses to Nepal, 500,000 doses to Moldova, and 500,000 doses to Bhutan.&nbsp; With these shipments, in this week alone, we have sent nearly 15 million doses to countries including Guatemala, Uruguay, Paraguay, Bolivia, Afghanistan, and Vietnam.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Indonesia, I also wanted to add that, in addition to the vaccines, we are also sending &#8212; we are also moving forward on plans to increase assistance for Indonesia’s broader COVID-19 response efforts.&nbsp; We recognize the difficult situation Indonesia currently finds itself in with a surge of COVID cases, and our thoughts are with all those in Indonesia who are affected.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, let me get to the week ahead<a>.</a></p>



<p>On Monday, the President will meet with local leaders &#8212; including law enforcement, elected officials, and a community violence intervention advocate &#8212; to discuss his administration’s comprehensive strategy to reduce gun crimes and other violent crimes.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s here at the White House.</p>



<p>     On Tuesday, the President will deliver remarks in Philadelphia &#8212; the birthplace of democracy &#8212; on his administration’s actions to protect the sacred, constitutional right to vote and the need to overcome anti-voter laws.  He will make the moral case to the American people on why the right to vote is fundamental to who we are as a nation.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Thursday, the President will deliver remarks to mark the day that tens of millions of families will get their first monthly tax relief payments thanks to the American Rescue Plan. The expanded Child Tax Credit provides working families $250 each month for every child 6 to 17 years old, and $300 each month for every child under 6 years old.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also Thursday, the President will welcome German Chancellor Angela Merkel to the White House for an official working visit.&nbsp; Her visit will affirm the deep and enduring bilateral ties between the United States and Germany.&nbsp; This forward-looking visit will address our robust partnership on shared global challenges and identify areas to further strengthen cooperation in the months and years ahead.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And on Friday, the President will participate in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Leaders Retreat &#8212; remotely, obviously &#8212; on the response to the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp; On Friday afternoon, the President will travel to Camp David, where he will remain over the weekend.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alex.&nbsp; That was a lot of information, hopefully.&nbsp; Go ahead.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was.&nbsp; And we have new information about a call with President Putin.&nbsp; Can you tell us more about what prompted this?&nbsp; Was it decided in response to these recent randomware &#8212; ransomware attacks?&nbsp; What exactly did President Biden say?&nbsp; He reiterated that the United States will take any necessary action to defend its people.&nbsp; What threats, if any, did he make?</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, I wanted to know &#8212; the top of readout suggests that it was partly, sort of, a pleasant call.&nbsp; The leaders commended their joint work.&nbsp; So can you explain why President Biden was at all pleasant in this call when it seems that there are all of these ransomware attacks coming from Russia that may have been government-approved?</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; First, let me say that the President is a believer in face-to-face diplomacy when possible and leader-to-leader diplomacy when that&#8217;s not possible, and this is an example of that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And this is the first time &#8212; even though ransomware attacks have been increasing over the past 18 months, if not longer &#8212; that there has been this level of engagement at this level.&nbsp; And certainly, the President knew, even when they met in Geneva, that there would be a need for ongoing discussions and engagements.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would say the reason that they commended the work of their teams is: This is consistent with the President&#8217;s view that diplomacy includes working together where there is opportunity and agreement, and being clear and candid and forthright when there&#8217;s disagreement.&nbsp; And this call is an example of that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, because of their agreement and the discussion they had in Geneva, the U.N. Security Council is going to extend access for humanitarian corridors &#8212; providing assistance, humanitarian assistance to people in Syria.&nbsp; That&#8217;s something that is pivotal and that is going to save lives.&nbsp; That is something to be commended.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, the President made clear, as I think you could see in the readout, that &#8212; he underscored the need for President Putin to take action to disrupt these ransomware groups.&nbsp; While REvil, we know, operates in Russia and other countries around the world, and we don&#8217;t have additional or new information suggesting the Russian government directed these attacks, we also know and we also believe that they have a responsibility.&nbsp; They have a responsibility to take action.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And as you can see in the readout, the President also made clear that the United States will take any necessary action to defend its people and its critical infrastructure.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, this was an example of leader-to-leader diplomacy &#8212; something the President feels is vital as he operates in the world.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And a quick note of clarification on the new CDC guidelines on schools &#8212;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; because there seems to be a lot of confusion when these come out.&nbsp; Schools are now supposed to allow teachers and students that are vaccinated not to wear masks, but they&#8217;re not recommended to keep track of that.&nbsp; Is that recommendation enforceable?&nbsp; And if not, why even make the recommendation to begin with?</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, going forward, as we&#8217;re seeing an increase in vaccinations &#8212; or increase in Delta &#8212; the Delta variant in some of these under-vaccinated clusters, is there a situation in which the administration would suggest returning to virtual learning at all?</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; First, the CDC laid out ways, several months ago, that all schools can safely return to in-person learning.&nbsp; That applies to schools in areas where there are high levels of vaccination and areas where there are lower levels of vaccination.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And thanks to the American Rescue Plan &#8212; $122 billion in funding &#8212; schools can implement these mitigation measures that they may not have been able to prior.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So this &#8212; this guidance today reiterated that masks should be worn indoors by all unvaccinated individuals; schools should continue to maintain at least three feet of physical distance.&nbsp; Screening, testing, ventilation, hand washing, and respiratory etiquette, staying home when sick, and getting tested, contact tracing with quarantine and isolation, and cleaning and disinfection continue to be important layers of prevention to keep schools safe.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, the guidelines that they provided &#8212; the guidance &#8212; is in line with their public health guidance that theyhave provided broadly.&nbsp; So if somebody is vaccinated, they are safe. &nbsp;If they are not vaccinated &#8212; which obviously applies to children who are under a certain age who are not yet eligible &#8212; then there are additional &#8212; there are guidelines that remain in place.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How these guidelines will be implemented has always been the purview of local school districts.&nbsp; That has always been the case with vaccines in general, even prior to the coronavirus.&nbsp; So, this is public health guidelines that they are providing.&nbsp; It is up to the school districts to apply and implement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead, Jeff.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some three weeks or so ago, President Biden, in Geneva, said that Vladimir Putin &#8220;knows there are consequences&#8221; &#8212; &#8220;he knows I will take action.&#8221;&nbsp; Did he raise the volume of a similar message in their call today, or did he amplify it in any way, or did he just repeat it?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I think, as the readout makes clear, he reiterated that the United States will take any necessary action to defend its people and its critical infrastructure.&nbsp; And he also reiterated his expectation that President Putin take action, even if it is not directed by the Russian government and if it is because of criminal actors in his own country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, I&#8217;m not going to give you a tone-and-tenor readout here.&nbsp; But the President believes that this is &#8212; that &#8212; and he&#8217;s always believed this was going to need to be an ongoing diplomatic engagement with the Russians.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve had expert-level talks.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve had those talks focused on cyber, focused on ransomware, but he also understands that there&#8217;s going to need to be talks at times at the leader level (inaudible).</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You said you don&#8217;t have new information that Russia was involved, specifically, in these attacks.&nbsp; Is that right?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Correct.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are the cyber groups still meeting next week &#8212; the U.S. group and the Russia side meeting next week on cyber?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yes.</p>



<p>Yes, go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, in this call with President Putin, did Putin provide any assurances to President Biden that he will in fact crack down on cyber criminals that are in his country?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I&#8217;m not going to read out on behalf of the Kremlin.&nbsp; I will let them read out their own &#8212; what the President conveyed &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But did &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; &#8212; to President Biden.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, sorry.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t mean to cut you off.&nbsp; But did President Putin provide any assurances to President Biden on that call at all?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Again, that&#8217;s not an appropriate role for the United States to convey.&nbsp; I can convey and read out to you what role President Biden played and what message he delivered to the Russians.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So you&#8217;ve talked about the visit of Chancellor Merkel coming on Thursday.&nbsp; What &#8212; to what extent will President Biden ask Germany and other countries that are involved to stand with him in a response to Russia on these ransomware attacks?&nbsp; Is that a big part of your agenda?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would say that it is &#8212; it has long been and it was &#8212; back to the G7 and the meetings on the President&#8217;s first foreign trip, part of his message to other European leaders and partners was: We need to stand together and work together to address the threat of ransomware cyberattacks.&nbsp; It is not just an issue for the United States.&nbsp; It is an issue for a range of countries around the globe.</p>



<p>In terms of what percentage of the meeting, I think we&#8217;ll have more as we get closer to the meeting with &#8212; with Chancellor Merkel.&nbsp; But, certainly, I would expect that the rising threat of cyber and ransomware would be part of the agenda.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And one more on Germany and then another quick one.&nbsp; So, on Germany, you know, this one residual issue that is still to be addressed has to do with Nord Stream.&nbsp; To what extent are you hopeful that you might be able to reach some kind of an agreement or extract some kind of promises from Germany that would stave off the need to have this tariff &#8212; sanctions takes place &#8212; take effect?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, it certainly will be a part of the discussion.&nbsp; And the President &#8212; our view continues to be that it&#8217;s a bad deal and one that has global issues involved in it.&nbsp; But I&#8217;m not going to predict for you what the outcome of the meeting will look like.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And just real &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yep.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; real quick on Haiti.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So we have some reporting that there&#8217;s an investigation going on about the role that Haitian Americans may have played in that attack.&nbsp; Can you say a few words about your understanding of that?&nbsp; I understand you&#8217;re sending to the FBI and DHS &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; and it may be a bit premature, but any readout now would be helpful.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have anything to update in that regard.&nbsp; Obviously, the investigation is being led by Haitian police forces on the ground.&nbsp; There have been some reports, I think you&#8217;re referencing, but I don&#8217;t have any update beyond that.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Would that be a serious concern for the White House if you found that there were in fact American citizens involved in this assassination?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, certainly.&nbsp; But I&#8217;m not going to get ahead of where the investigation is going.&nbsp; It&#8217;s ongoing.&nbsp; It&#8217;s led by the Haitians on the ground.</p>



<p>Go ahead, Kelly.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did the President, in his conversation with President Putin, expand on the list that he presented to him in Geneva about the types of critical infrastructure and parts of the U.S. economy that were off limits?&nbsp; Has the increase in ransomware informed his view on that to expand that?&nbsp; And should we interpret this call and the implicit warning in there again as a sign that the U.S. will act and act soon?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, first, I would say that, as you noted, the President did provide a list of critical infrastructure when he met with President Putin just a few weeks ago.&nbsp; He did that because, of course, an attack on critical infrastructure that would take out a swath of the American economy would have a significant national security impact.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He did not provide that list to say: If the attack is not on critical infrastructure, we&#8217;re not going to take action.&nbsp; That was not the restriction he gave himself.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I think, in this call today, he was making clear that, again &#8212; and reiterating again &#8212; that attacks by criminal groups, by actors that may not be directed by the Russian government, you still have a responsibility.</p>



<p>And in terms of actions, he made clear that he&#8217;s going to take steps to defend the American people and our own infrastructure and our interests here in the United States.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So while we&#8217;re not going to preview, operationally, what that looks like or what he may decide to do, he did make clear that he reserves that option to take action.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And do you think the President&#8217;s intent in having this call and on this topic within the call was to send that signal that action could be imminent?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I think his intent was to make clear and reiterate, again, that attacks by criminal groups, ransomware attacks by criminal groups on entities in the United States is not acceptable and that we reserve the right to take action.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead, Weijia.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Did President Biden specifically ask about Kaseya and the RNC hack in this phone call?&nbsp; And did Putin say he was investigating?&nbsp; Did he deny it?&nbsp; What was that conversation?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I&#8217;m still not going to read out what President Putin said, and I&#8217;m sure that the Kremlin will do their own readout of what he conveyed.&nbsp; I can tell you broadly that, of course, the ransomware attack that happened over the course of last weekend was a big focus, of course, of the call, which was &#8212; was clear in the readout that we provided.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Again, I would reiterate, on the RNC attack, that that &#8212; that the information we have to date is that that was on a third-party entity and it&#8217;s something the FBI is working with them on.&nbsp; We don&#8217;t have additional information beyond that at this point in time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did the President express when he would take this action (inaudible)?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I&#8217;m just not going to have more to read out for you on operational details or specifics.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; And I have a question on Hunter Biden&#8217;s artwork.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Mm-hmm.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did the White House play any role in crafting the sales agreement with the New York gallery to protect the &#8212; the purchasers &#8212; or the ultimate purchasers&#8217; identity?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I can tell you that after careful consideration, a system has been established that allows for Hunter Biden to work in his profession within reasonable safeguards.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course, he has the right to pursue an artistic career, just like any child of a President has the right to pursue a career.&nbsp; But all interactions regarding the selling of art and the setting of prices will be handled by a professional gallerist, adhering to the highest industry standards.&nbsp; And any offer out of the normal course would be rejected out of hand.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And the gallerist will not share information about buyers or prospective buyers, including their identities, with Hunter Biden or the administration, which provides quite a level of protection and transparency (inaudible).</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the gallery owner is a private citizen who might not be privy to who might have some interests in purchasing this artwork.&nbsp; Is the White House doing anything to work with the owner to make sure there&#8217;s not impropriety there, when it is ultimately sold?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I think it would be challenging for an anonymous person who we don&#8217;t know and Hunter Biden doesn&#8217;t know to have influence.&nbsp; So that&#8217;s a protection.</p>



<p>Go ahead.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; On this call this morning with the Russian President, did President Biden discuss at all the Taliban delegation that was in Moscow yesterday?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; The focus of the call and the conversation, which I can tell you was about an hour long, was really primarily on these two topics.&nbsp; I can see if there was anything in addition that was raised, and I can follow up with you after the briefing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; And then, on the Afghan translators: Does the President believe he has any executive authority to determine where these Afghan nationals await their visas?&nbsp; I know that the President said, yesterday, you guys are working closely with Congress.&nbsp; I want to know what that looks like.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But in addition, does he have any influence on where they wait out this time period for their visas &#8212; as he&#8217;s similarly exercised with immigrants at the southern border by ending the &#8220;Remain in Mexico&#8221; policy?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, it&#8217;s a different program, obviously &#8212; which I know you&#8217;re conveying.&nbsp; And what we are trying to determine is U.S. facilities and bases that are located in different parts of the world where we can house these brave and courageous individuals while their processing continues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re determining.&nbsp; We have not made a final determination of that.&nbsp; We&#8217;re trying to also protect, for security and operational reasons, what that may look like, even when a final determination is made.&nbsp; So I would see it as a different type of a program.&nbsp; And &#8212; but those are the considerations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And it&#8217;s already law, so we are &#8212; we are in a position where we can make a decision to &#8212; to relocate individuals from Afghanistan to these third-party countries.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, on the vaccine: Pfizer requesting approval for a third shot from regulators.&nbsp; CDC, FDA said, at this time, you don&#8217;t need a booster to be considered vaccinated.&nbsp; But what&#8217;s the timeline that you guys are looking at on when that would be recommended, especially as it pertains to meeting vaccination requirements to forego things like masks?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, first &#8212; and you referenced this, but just for others &#8212; the CDC and the FDA put out a pretty clear statement last night after the announcement by Pfizer, making clear that Americans who have been fully vaccinated do not need a booster shot at this time.</p>



<p>I&#8217;d also note that they are constantly engaged in a rigorous process to consider when &#8212; when a booster might be necessary.&nbsp; But it&#8217;s &#8212; I can&#8217;t make a prediction of that; that&#8217;s going to be led by the data and by the science.&nbsp; But at this time, that is not a determination that they have made, and we wanted to make clear that that is not something that the American people need to plan for at this moment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Go ahead.&nbsp; I&#8217;m just going to jump around because I haven&#8217;t gotten to a bunch of people in this room in a couple days.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Inaudible.)</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, a couple on Afghanistan, just to follow.&nbsp; Yesterday, the President said that he den- &#8212; he actually denied that the intelligence community had assessed that Af- &#8212; that the Afghan governments could collapse.&nbsp; That conflicts with the reporting at the Journal and other news outlets that said that it could collapse within six months.&nbsp; Was he not briefed on that intelligence?&nbsp; Or are you denying that intelligence exists at all?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, first, I would say that we, of course, abide by the intelligence presented by our own intelligence community.&nbsp; But the way the question was answered &#8212; and, in part, presented &#8212; was whether it was inevitable.&nbsp; And the President does not believe that it is inevitable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The intelligence community has never said it was inevitable for the &#8212; for the Taliban to take over the country.&nbsp; And so his objective or his &#8212; what he was trying to convey was that there&#8217;s a responsibility and the responsibility now lies in the hands of the Afghans.</p>



<p>We have provided &#8212; we have trained over 300,000.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve provided $3.9 billion in humanitarian assistance.&nbsp; These are brave fighters who have fought off &#8212; taken on casualties and fought off over the course of the last several years.&nbsp; We want to equip and empower them, and it is now in their hands.&nbsp; But it is not inevitable, nor has any intelligence assessment predicted it was inevitable.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And just one more.&nbsp; Yesterday, he also said that the U.S. doesn&#8217;t bear responsibility for any deaths that might occur after the U.S. withdraws.&nbsp; Can you explain, you know, how the U.S. doesn&#8217;t bear any responsibility for that?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I think what the President was conveying is that we are doing everything we can to equip, train, empower the Afghan National Security Forces, and we&#8217;re going to continue to remain engaged not just through the end of August, but then forward.&nbsp; But it&#8217;s going to be up to them to &#8212; it is ultimately their job and responsibility now to demonstrate their capabilities and their will to defend their country.&nbsp; And that was what he was working &#8212; attempting to convey yesterday.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And just really briefly on the competition executive order: Was there any discussion about trying to accomplish those goals through legislation?&nbsp; And would that be the President&#8217;s preferred approach over an executive order that could be overturned by his successor?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, there&#8217;s certainly value in legislation; it makes it more permanent.&nbsp; So there’s no question about that.&nbsp; But the President is going to continue to use authorities that every President before him has had &#8212; executive actions, executive &#8212; which allow him to take actions to make industries more competitive, to bring relief to consumers and the American people.</p>



<p>So I&#8217;m not going to rule out future legislative discussions with Congress should they want to pursue them.&nbsp; But these are actions he could take that could have a huge, immediate impact on the American people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead, in the middle.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just two quick questions, Jen.&nbsp; The first is: I spoke with a number of justice organizations and families that want to know if the President is going to address the over 4,000 inmates &#8212; low-offending inmates &#8212; that are at home, sent home due to the pandemic, then they have to go back.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They&#8217;re saying that they want to know: Is he going to make a statement, how is he going to address it, and is he willing to find a way to keep them home, whether that&#8217;s granting clemency or ordering the DOJ to go back and revisit that memo that was done under the Trump administration?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure, it&#8217;s &#8212; it&#8217;s a great question.&nbsp; It is something that President is following closely.&nbsp; A lot of it is under the purview of the Department of Justice.&nbsp; I can see if there&#8217;s any new update for you that I can provide to you after the briefing.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, on the campaign trail, the President said, “Especially for those moments when this campaign was at its lowest, the African American community stood up again for me.”&nbsp; Then, “They always have my back and I&#8217;ll have theirs.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>With that said, I know you said on Tuesday he&#8217;s going to Philly, but there are many activists on the ground who feel like the President has not done all that he can.&nbsp; Are we going to see him going state to state, like he did with infrastructure, and having a very in-your-face approach with many Republicans, like in Arizona, confronting some of these rules or even pressing Democrats when it comes to nuking the filibuster?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, first, I would say that the speech the President is delivering is about our fundamental right to vote in the country and the moral obligation we all have to defend that, stand up for that.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not about legislative process, and this issue is bigger than that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I would say that: To those who are critics, we stand with you in wanting to make voting more accessible around the country.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s why the President signed a historic executive order into law in his first month in office.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why he &#8212; his Department of Justice has already taken action to double the funding and support around the country to fighting voter laws and fighting voter suppression.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why he fought &#8212; nominated and fought for the confirmation of Kristen Clarke and Vanita Gupta, two civil rights activists who are now playing prominent roles in the Department of Justice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He has said this will be the cause of his presidency.&nbsp; He&#8217;s delivering a speech in Philadelphia &#8212; the foundation of democracy &#8212; next Tuesday.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s a continuation of his efforts.</p>



<p>Go ahead.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, thank you.&nbsp; Nobody really would expect you to preview what the United States might do as a retaliatory cyberattack on Russia, but does the President understand that &#8212; assuming Russia would not acknowledge such an attack, does he understand that for political consumption &#8212; domestic political consumption, perhaps worldwide political consumption &#8212; that we have to make some kind of show of it; we have to point out that we have to respond and the United States has responded and then the President has fulfilled what he said he would do?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would say the President doesn&#8217;t make his global decisions or his decisions as Commander-in-Chief or a leader in the global community based on politics; he makes them on what is in the interests of our national security, in the interests of the American people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And certainly &#8212; I know you alluded to this &#8212; but I don&#8217;t think anyone expects him or us to preview our punches.&nbsp; He reserves that option, has been clear about that, and we&#8217;re probably not going to preview that in advance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead, Karen.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But doesn&#8217;t he want to make a show of it, though?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I think I&#8217;ve answered your question.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead, Karen.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; Two questions on vaccines, and back to Pfizer saying that the third shot is better.&nbsp; You&#8217;ve mentioned that the FDA and the CDC came out very quickly with a statement saying it&#8217;s not needed at this time, but is anybody in the administration asking Pfizer to coordinate on announcements like this so Americans are not confused to see such a whiplash of headlines?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, they are a private-sector company.&nbsp; I can&#8217;t speak to their &#8212; the origin or the motivation of their announcement; you&#8217;d have to ask them that.&nbsp; But the role we can play from the U.S. government is to provide accurate information and public health information, which is what we ventured to do last night pretty rapidly in response to the announcement.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And you were asked about this on Wednesday on Air Force One, but I just want to go back to it because there&#8217;s still pushback about the President&#8217;s comments about going door to door to encourage vaccinations.</p>



<p>The South Carolina governor said today that “Enticing, coercing, intimidating, mandating, or pressuring anyone to take a vaccine is a bad policy that will deteriorate the public trust and confidence in the state&#8217;s efforts.”&nbsp; And Governor McMaster said he&#8217;s going to prohibit the state health agency from using the administration&#8217;s targeted tactics.&nbsp; Can you respond to the governor and explain what it is that is being done and what is not being done in this outreach?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; Well, let me first say that the failure to provide accurate public health information, including the efficacy of vaccines and the accessibility of them to people across the country, including South Carolina, is literally killing people, so maybe they should consider that.&nbsp; But I would say that what this is and what is &#8212; it is not &#8212; this is not federal employees going door to door.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is grassroots volunteers, this is members of the clergy, these are volunteers who believe that people across the country, especially in low-vaccinated areas, should have accurate information, should have information about where they can get vaccinated, where they can save their own lives and their neighbors’ lives and their family members&#8217; lives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That&#8217;s exactly what this is.&nbsp; It&#8217;s something that&#8217;s been going on since April.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s something where we&#8217;ve seen an impact in states where there are lower vaccination rates.&nbsp; So, it is something we will continue to &#8212; to work with local groups to do.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s a disservice to the country and to the people who may lose their lives, who may lose family members to provide inaccurate disinformation at a moment when we&#8217;re still fighting a pandemic.</p>



<p>Go ahead, George.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; Two questions on the President&#8217;s trade agenda.&nbsp; He&#8217;s spoken a lot about “Buy America” and he settled the Airbus thing, but when can we expect activity on the major things like lifting the Trump tariffs or the UK talks?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; This is, of course, under the purview of Ambassador Tai, and somebody who is working every day to work with countries around the world to communicate what our agenda is.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have anything to predict for you in terms of additional components of his trade agenda.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I will note that as he looks at our global approach, our economic approach, he believes that we need to build the middle class, make sure we are making decisions through the prism of what&#8217;s going to help the middle class here in the United States.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yeah.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any reaction to the IMF calling on him to lift the tariffs?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We&#8217;re continuing to review.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have any update for you on a timeline.</p>



<p>Go ahead.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; So, I have a question on vaccine sharing, and then on Afghanistan.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On vaccine sharing, many humanitarian organizations say that despite $1 billion doses pledged by G7, the lion&#8217;s share of which is coming from the U.S., it&#8217;s still not nearly enough to get the world vaccinated, to stop the spread of variants.&nbsp; My question is: Does the administration have any plans to expand from the 580 million doses already pledged?</p>



<p>And jumping off on your Indonesia announcement, the Jakarta government has just announced that they&#8217;re going to use the 3 million Moderna doses to vaccinate one and a half million healthcare workers who have already been vaccinated &#8212; fully vaccinated with Sinovac.&nbsp; So, would you care to comment about that in regards to U.S. vaccine diplomacy versus Chinese vaccine goals?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; Well, first, I would say that there are no strings attached to our vaccines that we&#8217;re providing.&nbsp; We&#8217;re providing them around the world to save lives and to be a contributor to the global effort to fight the pandemic.</p>



<p>You&#8217;re absolutely right that there are more doses needed beyond the billion.&nbsp; I would note that the United States is far and away the largest contributor in the world to the fight against the pandemic, including specific doses of vaccines.&nbsp; And we have &#8212; the President has made clear that we will continue to build from here, and we&#8217;re working on manufacturing capacity around the world and in the United States, and we will continue to contribute even beyond the billion doses.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And on Afghanistan, the Taliban has captured a key border crossing with Iran today &#8212; a move that&#8217;s designed to choke the Kabul government economically.&nbsp; So if the Taliban continues to make military gains to push the Kabul government towards collapse, at what point would the President reconsider his strike policy to include airstrikes on the Taliban rather than just ISIS and al Qaeda?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I’m not going to predict an outcome that we are certainly working to &#8212; with the Afghan National Security Forces to push against.</p>



<p>I can reiterate, of course, why the President made the decision he made based on a clear-eyed assessment of what the impact could be.</p>



<p>But at this point in time, what our focus is on is ensuring we are bringing our servicemen and women home from Afghanistan on the timeline he outlined yesterday; that we are spreading our counterterrorism capacity out to parts of the world where we see the biggest threats beyond Afghanistan; that we are continuing to work to empower, equip, train, support financially the Afghan National Security Forces.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.&nbsp; We&#8217;re almost halfway through the 90-day period that the White House has set for the U.S. intelligence community to redouble its efforts and analyze information about the origin of COVID-19.&nbsp; Is the President receiving or has the President received any update on that front?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have any updates to provide to all of you, but go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; And then, second question: Delegates to the National Education Association, they approved a measure last week calling for support of, quote, “implementation of culturally responsive education, critical race theory, and ethnic studies curriculum” in preK-through-12 and higher education.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The President is obviously a big fan of education.&nbsp; The First Lady is a teacher; she&#8217;s a union teacher.&nbsp; I&#8217;m wondering: What are the President&#8217;s thoughts on anti-racism curriculum in the classroom?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, the President believes that, in our history, there’s many dark moments.&nbsp; And there is not just slavery and racism in our history; there are systemic racism that is still impacting society today.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And he believes &#8212; as I believe, as a parent of children &#8212; that kids should learn about our history.&nbsp; So as the spouse of an educator and as somebody who is &#8212; continues to believe that children should learn not just the good, but also the challenging in our history.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s part of what we&#8217;re talking about here, even as it&#8217;s become politically charged.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I just want to follow up on something you said about Pfizer.&nbsp; Before, you said this is a private-sector company.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a company that&#8217;s gotten billions of dollars from the federal government, and it&#8217;s a key part of probably the most important effort you&#8217;re working on right now.&nbsp; Given that, is it still not appropriate to coordinate on messaging that might confuse people?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, again, the role we can play is to determine how we communicate from the federal government and how we communicate accurate public health information to the American people.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s what we ventured to do as quickly as possible last night after the statement came out.</p>



<p>Go ahead, Jen.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just on the EO that the President is about to sign: We’ve seen some of the business groups that, you know, while not often the allies of Democrats, have been, especially around the infrastructure deal &#8212; groups like the Chamber of Commerce &#8212; expressing concern that government is just, kind of, inserting itself too much into business dealings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The National Association of Manufacturers saying they are “solutions in search of a problem” and threaten to “undo progress by undermining free markets [that] are premised on the false notion our workers are not positioned for success.”</p>



<p>And, you know &#8212; and more broadly, are you just concerned about the reaction coming from industry that they will try to push back on this, that there will likely be lawsuits and all &#8212; and all kinds of other things that can bog down this?&nbsp; And how are you planning to respond to all of that?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, there may be, but I think the role and the President&#8217;s role is to &#8212; to focus on what&#8217;s in the interests of American consumers.&nbsp; And his view is that when you have a lack of competition that&#8217;s driving up prices for consumers, driving down wages for workers, a lack of competition that is costing the median American household $5,000 per year, that, as the President of the United States &#8212; somebody who represents middle-class Americans across the country &#8212; he has a responsibility to act.&nbsp; We understand some may be opposed to that, and that&#8217;s okay; it&#8217;s a free country.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I follow up &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Go ahead.&nbsp; Go ahead, very quickly, Brian.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; The follow-up to that is: You said in the statement today that he&#8217;s going to take decisive action against consolidation in a lot of industries.&nbsp; Does that include the media industry?&nbsp; I mean, we suffer consolidation more than any other.&nbsp; So is your administration going to break up the large media conglomerates?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don’t have anything to predict or preview for you on that front.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I’m from a large media conglomerate.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; (Laughter.)</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, a question &#8212; a question on Haiti.&nbsp;</p>



<p>(Some members of the press exit the briefing room.)</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Nothing crazy is happening.&nbsp; The pool has to gather.</p>



<p>Go ahead.&nbsp; (Laughter.)</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A question on Haiti: How will the arrest of two Americans affect the assistance that the FBI and DHS provides to Haitian authorities?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Our assistance is to help the people of Haiti and to help them get through what is a very challenging time and has long been even before the assassination of the President.&nbsp; So, the investigation is not going to impact the assistance we&#8217;re providing to the people of Haiti.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But as you &#8212; as I announced at the beginning, we are sending &#8212; because supporting law enforcement efforts on the ground and making sure we are providing resources &#8212; in terms of women- and manpower, but also financial resources &#8212; is part of what our objective is as well.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And how many law enforcement agents are we sending?&nbsp; And have there been any requests for any additional aid from the U.S., either from the State Department or another agency?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, this &#8212; this action was in response to a specific request.&nbsp; So, that&#8217;s what it exactly was.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have a specific number.&nbsp; I can check and see if there&#8217;s something more specific we can provide to you.</p>



<p>Go ahead, Eugene.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the Biden administration considering easing travel restrictions to allow vaccinated people into the U.S.?&nbsp; The CDC has already said that you can &#8212; it’s safe to travel &#8212; I’ve done it; a lot of us have done it &#8212; if you’re fully vaccinated.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; There&#8217;s an ongoing process, which I know is to the frustration of many, which includes working groups with countries so that we can communicate about and share information about what the criteria will be for easing these travel restrictions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We certainly want to ensure families are reunited, people are reunited, people can travel &#8212; as you have, as you’ve said &#8212; but I don&#8217;t have anything to predict in terms of the timeline there.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The question is: If the conditions are the same &#8212; they’re otherwise the same &#8212; why does the destination matter?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; They look at a range of criteria, but it&#8217;s based on public health discussions.&nbsp; Public health experts are a part of these discussions on all sides from our country and from the others who are participating.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And last question: In May, the administration came out in support of the TRIPS Waiver, which would make vaccines more available around the world by waiving the IP protections.&nbsp; Angela Merkel will be here next Thursday.&nbsp; Germany is against the TRIPS Waiver.&nbsp; They &#8212; and I think it has to be unanimous.&nbsp; Is President Biden &#8212; is that on the agenda for President Biden to talk to her about that?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; He is a strong proponent of it.&nbsp; It’s one tool in our toolbox.&nbsp; There are a number of others, including increasing manufacturing.&nbsp; Obviously, we&#8217;ve already made an announcement about the number of doses &#8212; the 500 million we&#8217;re sharing around the world &#8212; and we&#8217;ve already started implementing them.</p>



<p>I know &#8212; it sounds like there&#8217;s a lot of interest in what will be on the agenda.&nbsp; Let me see if there&#8217;s more about the agenda for the meeting with the German Chancellor to predict.</p>



<p>Let me go all the way to the &#8212; go ahead, in the middle.&nbsp; Go, in the middle.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; Just two quick questions.&nbsp; First, on voting rights: Is the speech next week in Pennsylvania &#8212; is it like a one-off speech or is the President going to, sort of, consistently start to deliver speeches and have events publicly on this issue?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, he just had a meeting with civil rights leaders yesterday.&nbsp; And we provided a readout of that.&nbsp; So, I can’t predict for you what the schedule will look like beyond next Tuesday, but this is an opportunity to go to the birthplace of democracy to make the case for the moral imperative of making voting more accessible to people across the country.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And just quickly on &#8212; it&#8217;s been several months since Neera Tanden was withdrawn as the nominee to lead OMB.&nbsp; Is there an update on the timeline for when the President might nominate a full-time nominee to lead that department?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; There &#8212; I do not have a timeline update for you.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, thanks, Jen.&nbsp; As you probably have noticed, gas prices are up considerably right now all across the U.S.&nbsp; The average price of gasoline is $3.14.&nbsp; In fact, gas prices are up 40 percent since the very beginning of the year.&nbsp; What is your message to motorists out there in the country that are concerned about how much it costs to get to work every day, how it&#8217;s really impacting their family budgets?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, first, I would say that gas prices do historically rise in the summer, and that&#8217;s particularly true even in moments like this where there&#8217;s a spike in people traveling.&nbsp; And even more people are hitting the road now because of our success in defeating the pandemic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, in the last 10 years pre-pandemic, for example, the average price of gas in July is nearly 30 cents higher than it is in January.&nbsp; And any prices are higher now than they were last year because Americans are finally able to travel.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I just thought that context was important as it relates, but the President is quite focused on ensuring that we are doing everything we can to keep prices low for the &#8212; to keep the cost of living low for the American people, including the cost of gas.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why he was against &#8212; vehemently against a gas tax; why he was against a vehicle mileage tax.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We are not a member &#8212; a party of OPEC, as you know.&nbsp; We are engaged with a number of countries, in part because we want to ensure that we are remaining abreast of what is happening in those discussions as well, because that will have an impact.</p>



<p>But his direct message to the American people is that he is going to work &#8212; just as he worked to get the virus under control, he’s going to &#8212; and to create jobs &#8212; he&#8217;s going to work to ensure we are doing everything we can to keep the gas price low.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will releasing oil from the SPR have any impact?&nbsp; Is that a consideration of the administration?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have anything to predict on that front.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure, go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; As a candidate, President Biden said &#8212; and I&#8217;m quoting &#8212; quote, “I have never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings.”&nbsp; But recently, photographs and documents have called that into question. &nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2015, President Biden, as Vice President, met at Cafe Milano with his son&#8217;s Ukrainian, Russian, and Kazakhstani business associates one day before a Burisma executive thanked the First Son for the opportunity to meet his father.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And also, in 2015, as Vice President, the President hosted at the Naval Observatory Mexican business associates of Hunter Biden before Hunter Biden emailed these associates from Air Force Two the next year, going to Mexico.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So I have kind of a two-part question.&nbsp; Was President Biden indeed unaware that his son was pursuing business opportunities with these people he met?&nbsp; And also, according to recent reporting, the First Son still has a stake in a Chinese investment company.&nbsp; When is he going to unload that?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; On the last part: He&#8217;s working to unload that.&nbsp; I&#8217;d point you to his representatives.&nbsp; The President does not discuss business dealings with family members.&nbsp; And otherwise, I&#8217;m not going to respond to Rudy Giuliani&#8217;s lawyer.</p>



<p>Go ahead, in the back.&nbsp; Go ahead.&nbsp; Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; I wanted to ask you about the executive order that the President is going to sign on competition.&nbsp; Most of that executive order, to me, looks like it would be done through regulation at the agencies &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; and in directing a whole bunch of different rulemaking.&nbsp; Can you talk about &#8212; so, the office inside OMB that handles regulations still has no director &#8212; or administrator, I believe, is the title.&nbsp; Can you talk about how the coordination is going to go to get this all out the door and make sure that it&#8217;s &#8212; I mean, cross the T&#8217;s and dot the i&#8217;s without someone in that job that would traditionally do that?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; Well, first, I would say that OMB has &#8212; is one of the agencies in the federal government that is also staffed by talented men and women from the Career Service, and they can help make sure we are continuing to function and implement government actions, and that continues to be the case in this regard.</p>



<p>As you noted, the order includes several actions that agencies would take, which &#8212; those actions would be implemented within agencies; even independent agencies, of course, will make their own decisions.&nbsp; So this order is encouraging independent agencies to take certain actions, even as they make those decisions.</p>



<p>But the federal government is designed in a way so that we can function from administration to administration, even as individuals need to be nominated and confirmed.&nbsp; And that is certainly the case in this regard as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All right, let&#8217;s see.&nbsp; Go ahead.&nbsp; Go ahead, Nikki.&nbsp; Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, thanks.&nbsp; So, since Tampa won the Stanley Cup, what is President Biden &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; All right, that wasn’t on my bingo card today, but that’s fine.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A fun little segue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yep.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is President Biden receiving from Prime Minister Trudeau?&nbsp; Because I know that there’s a bet out there.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Mm-hmm.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, when are we going to see the Lightning or other, sort of, bigger events start happening again at the White House?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Soon.&nbsp; We’ve already started to have events.&nbsp; As you all know, we’ve had some over the course of the last few weeks.&nbsp; We’ve already welcomed one sports team here to the White House, and there will be more to come.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t have a prediction of the timeline, but we are starting to schedule and plan those events for the coming months.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And do you know the winnings?&nbsp; Like what is the President getting from the Prime Minister?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; (Laughs.)&nbsp; I don’t have an update on that specifically, but we can see if there&#8217;s more detail to share.</p>



<p>Why don&#8217;t we go all the way in the back.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; Can you give us an update on the nuclear talks in Vienna?&nbsp; Will we have a seventh round of talks?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sorry, I didn&#8217;t hear the last part.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nuclear talks in Vienna.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yes.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nuclear talks.&nbsp; Will we have a seventh round of talks?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; That is certainly the intention, but I don&#8217;t have any update on the timeline of those.</p>



<p>Go ahead, next to you.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you very much, Jen.&nbsp; On China: Is the White House planning to hold another phone call with Chinese leader Xi?&nbsp; At the G20 Summit in October, is President Biden willing to hold a summit with Xi, on the sidelines?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I know the G20 summit is coming up right around Halloween, but that is quite some time from now in terms of the planning and what other events may or may not be around it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Certainly, we are in touch, at a very high level, with Chinese leaders.&nbsp; In terms of an upcoming call with President Xi, I don&#8217;t have anything to predict on that front.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Why don&#8217;t we go all the way &#8212; I&#8217;m just trying to get all the way to the back because I&#8217;m not great at doing that.&nbsp; Go all the way in the &#8212; yeah, go ahead.&nbsp; Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.&nbsp; On the competition policy executive order, are there any additional steps that have already been taken, like at the interagency level, so that we&#8217;re going to see a proposed rule from the Department of Transportation on airline fees or something &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; next Tuesday?&nbsp; How much of this is sort of pre-staged versus starting at the beginning of the process?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, where appropriate, with agencies that &#8212; of course, not independent agencies that we&#8217;ve been working closely with &#8212; we have been working with them to develop policies and do that in alignment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The timing of proposed rules, I would point you to each agency.&nbsp; Obviously, as you know, that takes some time depending on the complication of the role.&nbsp; But we developed this through an interagency process, where appropriate, and there is, of course, broad support for the competition agenda in the administration.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I also just also ask: Because there was another &#8212; the Bipartisan Policy Center had a report the other day on the debt limit.&nbsp; Treasury has been unclear on when exactly the &#8220;X date&#8221; will arrive.&nbsp; Is the President going to be pushing Congress to raise the debt limit or suspend it again before they leave for the August recess in the early August?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I think the President certainly expects that Congress will take steps, as they have three times during the prior administration, to raise the debt limit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All right, I think we have to wrap up because I think you have to &#8212; we&#8217;re going to move to the President&#8217;s remarks.&nbsp; Thank you, everyone.&nbsp; Have a wonderful weekend.</p>
