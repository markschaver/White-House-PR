										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>Today,&nbsp;President Biden met&nbsp;in Jeddah&nbsp;with&nbsp;the&nbsp;leaders&nbsp;of the Gulf Cooperation Council&nbsp;(GCC)&nbsp;– Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates – the Republic of Egypt,&nbsp;the Republic of Iraq, and the Kingdom of Jordan (together known as the GCC+3). Named the “Jeddah Security and Development Summit,” this was the first&nbsp;summit&nbsp;of its kind&nbsp;among these nine countries. Throughout, the leaders&nbsp;reaffirmed their commitment to a prosperous, peaceful, and integrated Middle East region, and in working together to address global challenges, such as confronting new diseases, ensuring food and energy security, and addressing the climate crisis through partnerships. &nbsp;</p>



<p>At the Summit,&nbsp;President Biden reiterated the importance the United States places on its decades-long strategic partnerships in the Middle East region, affirmed the United States’ enduring commitment to the security and territorial defense of U.S. partners, and recognized the region’s increasingly important role as a trade and technology&nbsp;crossroads between&nbsp;hemispheres. &nbsp;He also strongly affirmed the centrality of the Middle East region to the long-term security and prosperity of the United States and the American people.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>America’s Commitment to the Middle East Region&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>President Biden set forth five declaratory principles&nbsp;– partnership, deterrence, diplomacy, integration, and values –&nbsp;to guide&nbsp;U.S. engagement in the Middle East over the coming decades:</p>



<p>1.&nbsp;<strong>Partnerships</strong>:&nbsp;The&nbsp;United States&nbsp;will&nbsp;support and strengthen&nbsp;partnerships with countries that subscribe to the rules-based international order, and we will make sure those countries can defend themselves against foreign threats.</p>



<p>2.&nbsp;<strong>Deterrence:&nbsp;</strong>The&nbsp;United States&nbsp;will not allow foreign&nbsp;or regional powers to jeopardize freedom of navigation through the Middle East’s waterways, including the Strait of Hormuz and the Bab al Mandab,&nbsp;nor tolerate efforts by any country to dominate another – or the region – through military buildups, incursions, or threats.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>3.&nbsp;<strong>Diplomacy:&nbsp;</strong>The&nbsp;United States&nbsp;will not just aim to deter threats to regional stability, we will work to reduce tensions, de-escalate, and end conflicts wherever possible through diplomacy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>4.&nbsp;<strong>Integration:&nbsp;</strong>The United States&nbsp;will build political, economic, and security connections between U.S. partners wherever possible, while respecting each country’s sovereignty and independent choices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>5.&nbsp;<strong>Values:&nbsp;</strong>The United States will always promote human rights and the values enshrined in the UN Charter. &nbsp;</p>



<p>This address by President Biden frames U.S. engagement going forward in a manner that harnesses unique American capabilities, in concert with long-standing U.S. partners.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition, the leaders around the table agreed to:</p>



<p><strong>Ensure&nbsp;Food Security for the Middle East’s Most Vulnerable Populations</strong></p>



<p>&nbsp;President Biden announced the United States&nbsp;has committed $1 billion in new acute near to long term food security assistance for the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region.&nbsp;&nbsp;Recognizing that the impacts of and capacity to respond to global food insecurity are unevenly distributed across countries, leaders of the Gulf Cooperation Council underscored their commitment to supporting vulnerable populations in the MENA region through the&nbsp;Arab Coordination Group (ACG)’s recently-announced $10 billion food security package. &nbsp;Together, the United States and the GCC countries will leverage their collective assistance funds to address immediate humanitarian needs and disruptions, including guaranteeing full, safe, and unhindered humanitarian access to populations in need across the region.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;The United States, the GCC members, Egypt, Iraq, and Jordan signed the&nbsp;<em>Roadmap for Global Food Security – Call&nbsp;to Action</em>, which was unveiled in May 2022 at the Ministerial Meeting of the United Nations. &nbsp;At the GCC+3 Summit, leaders affirmed their collective commitment to act with urgency, at scale, and in concert to respond to the urgent food security and nutrition needs of millions of people in vulnerable situations the world. &nbsp;They committed to provide immediate humanitarian assistance, build resilience of those in vulnerable situations, near-to medium food security assistance to strengthen social protection and safety nets, and strengthen sustainable, resilient, and inclusive food systems in line with the objectives of the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its Sustainable Development Goals, and the objectives of the 2021 UN Food Systems Summit.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Enhance&nbsp;Strategic Investment Cooperation</strong></p>



<p>&nbsp;GCC&nbsp;partners plan&nbsp;to invest&nbsp;a total of&nbsp;$3 billion in projects that align with U.S. Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) goals to&nbsp;deliver quality, sustainable infrastructure that makes a difference in people’s lives around the world, strengthens and diversifies our supply chains, creates new opportunities for American workers and businesses, and advances our national security.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;The&nbsp;Partnership for Global Infrastructure&nbsp;and Investment, which the President and G7 leaders unveiled at the June 26, 2022, G7 Summit,&nbsp;will be executed across four priority pillars that will define the second half of the 21<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;century. &nbsp;This includes:</p>



<p>o&nbsp;Tackling the climate crisis and bolstering global energy security through investments in climate resilient infrastructure, transformational energy technologies, and developing clean energy supply chains across the full integrated lifecycle, from the responsible mining of metals and critical minerals; to low-emissions transportation and hard infrastructure; to investing in new global refining, processing, and battery manufacturing sites; to deploying proven, as well as innovative, scalable technologies in places that do not yet have access to clean energy.</p>



<p>o&nbsp;Developing, expanding, and deploying secure information and communications technology (ICT) networks and infrastructure to power economic growth and facilitate open digital societies—from working with trusted vendors to provide 5G and 6G digital connectivity, to supporting access to platforms and services that&nbsp;depend upon an open, interoperable, secure, and reliable internet and mobile networks with sound cybersecurity.</p>



<p>o&nbsp;Advancing gender equality and equity—from care infrastructure that increases opportunities for economic participation by women, to improved water and sanitation infrastructure that addresses gender gaps in unpaid work and time use – in order to boost the global economic recovery by ensuring that half the population is not forced to sit on the sidelines.</p>



<p>o&nbsp;Developing and upgrading the infrastructure of health systems and contributing to global health security through investments in patient-centered health services and the health workforce; vaccine and other essential medical product manufacturing; and disease surveillance and early warning systems, including safe and secure labs. Addressing the current pandemic and preventing and preparing for the next one is crucial to U.S. economic and national security.</p>



<p><strong>Improve&nbsp;Patient Care&nbsp;for Palestinians</strong></p>



<p>&nbsp;Following President Biden’s July 15 announcement of a U.S. contribution of $100 million for the East Jerusalem Hospital Network, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE pledged $25 million each for a matching total of $100 million. &nbsp;Our combined $200 million assistance package will help the East Jerusalem Hospital Network upgrade its infrastructure and improve patient care for thousands of Palestinians in the West Bank, East Jerusalem, and Gaza&nbsp;who rely on the network for life-saving treatment.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Further&nbsp;Iraq’s Energy Integration with the GCC and Jordan</strong></p>



<p>&nbsp;President Biden welcomed Iraq concluding&nbsp;agreements&nbsp;with Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Jordan&nbsp;to bring affordable energy to Iraq and diversify its supply and ensure energy resiliency to meet the growing needs of its people. &nbsp;The landmark agreement signed today between Iraq and the GCC Interconnection Authority (GCCIA) will link Iraq’s electricity grid to the grids in the GCC thereby providing the Iraqi people with new and diversified sources of electricity over the coming decade.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Address Global Economic Security&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>&nbsp;President Biden spoke with Middle East leaders about the&nbsp;importance of&nbsp;addressing&nbsp;current&nbsp;global energy&nbsp;insecurities&nbsp;and managing energy price pressures by ensuring a steadily increasing supply by producing countries through 2022 and 2023, including through increasing investments in refining capacity. &nbsp;President Biden&nbsp;welcomed the recent announcement by OPEC+ to increase supply over the course of July and August. &nbsp;President&nbsp;Biden&nbsp;anticipates&nbsp;additional supply increases over the coming months, depending on market conditions and analysis, including record-setting domestic production from the United States.</p>



<p><strong>Integrated Air and Martine Defense Cooperation</strong></p>



<p>&nbsp;President Biden affirmed the United States’ commitment to accelerate ongoing work with its&nbsp;allies&nbsp;and partners in the Middle East to integrate and enhance security cooperation. &nbsp;In particular, the United States is committed to advancing a more integrated and regionally-networked air and missile defense architecture and countering the proliferation of&nbsp;unmanned aerial systems and missiles to non-state actors that threaten the peace and security of the region.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;<a></a>President Biden also reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to&nbsp;preserving the free flow of commerce through strategic international waterways like the Bab al-Mandab and the Strait of Hormuz, through which 40 percent of the world’s energy passes every day,&nbsp;via&nbsp;multiple joint naval task forces, in partnership with longstanding U.S. partners integrated through U.S. Central Command.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Via Teleconference</p>



<p>8:14 A.M. AST</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Thank you, everyone, for joining our call today.&nbsp; As a reminder of the ground rules, this call is on background with the contents attributable to a “senior administration official,” and the contents are embargoed until the conclusion of the call.</p>



<p>For your awareness but not for your reporting, this morning’s speaker is [senior administration official].&nbsp;</p>



<p>[Senior administration official], I&#8217;ll kick it over to you for some opening remarks.&nbsp; And then we can take a few questions.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; Good morning.&nbsp; I apologize, my &#8212; our time is pretty limited here this morning.&nbsp; But let me go through where we are here as we are on the final day of the President&#8217;s trip to the Middle East.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And as you heard the President say last night, he came here to Saudi Arabia to meet with the GCC and nine other leaders to discuss the security and strategic priorities of the United States and to demonstrate that we have no intent to leave a vacuum here in the Middle East, particularly for Russia or China to fill, or for that matter, Iran.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And if you’ve not yet seen this morning, we have (inaudible) a new example of some of the engagements between Russia and Iran that we think is fairly pertinent.&nbsp; I believe that there&#8217;s a story on CNN that ran this morning about this.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And as Jake mentioned last week, we assess an official Russian delegation recently received a showcase of Iranian attack-capable UAVs.&nbsp; And we released those satellite imagery that shows this, as it suggests ongoing Russian interest in acquiring Iranian attack-capable UAVs, obviously for use in there or Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And to our knowledge, this is the first time the Russian delegation has visited this airfield for such a showcase.&nbsp; And we think it&#8217;s of interest &#8212; I mean, to put it mildly &#8212; to what&#8217;s happening here in the Middle East.&nbsp; I mean, Russia is effectively making a bet on Iran, and we are making a bet on a more integrated, more stable, more peaceful and prosperous Middle East region, which is what you&#8217;ll hear throughout the summit today.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So with that, I&#8217;ll go over through the schedule for today and some of the outcomes that you can expect.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, today, the President will meet in Jeddah with leaders of the Gulf Cooperation Council &#8212; that is Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and UAE, together with the Republic of Egypt, Iraq, and the Kingdom of Jordan.&nbsp; And, you know, here these leaders discuss ways to address global challenges such as confronting new diseases, ensuring food and energy security, and addressing the climate crisis through new partnerships.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You&#8217;ll also hear the President underscore the region’s central role in connecting the Indo-Pacific to Europe, Africa, and the Americas.&nbsp; I think a theme throughout this visit is that even as we have challenges and priorities elsewhere, the importance of the Middle East, if anything, is only heightened, and we’re demonstrating that throughout the trip and the importance of America&#8217;s engagement here in this critical region.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So in his remarks during the summit, President Biden will set forth really five declaratory principles on the Biden doctrine for this region, as he is the first President to visit the Middle East since the attacks on 9/11, over 20 years ago, really without Americans involved in a major ground war or combat &#8212; combat missions.&nbsp; Principles such as partnership, deterrence, diplomacy, integration, and values that will guide U.S. engagement in the Middle East over the coming decades.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And if you just think about it, I mean, the objectives that have been pursued here in this region &#8212; it’s a theme that was in the President&#8217;s op-ed a couple of weeks ago before the visit &#8212; very &#8212; objectives such as regime change through military force, building nations, changing regime.&nbsp; Objectives that really were out of America’s reach to deliver and drained our attention and resources and capacity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now that we are focused on what we think is a far more realistic set of objectives &#8212; very central to our interests and the interests of our partners &#8212; the comparative advantage of the United States to build alliances, to build partnerships, to integrate, to find connections that don’t exist, to strengthen connections that develop is really front and center.&nbsp; So I think it is an era in which the unique capabilities of the United States can play a really important role here in forging new partnerships and strengthening alliances and coalitions.</p>



<p>In that regard, the President will also announce today that the United States has committed $1 billion in new near- to long-term food security assistance for the Middle East and North Africa region.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The President will also announce &#8212; and this will be in the communiqués that come after the summit &#8212; that the GCC leaders are committing $3 billion, over the next two years, in projects that align with the U.S. Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment &#8212; PGII.&nbsp; The goal is to deliver quality, sustainable infrastructure that make a difference in people&#8217;s lives around the world, strengthens and diversifies our supply chains, and creates new opportunities for American workers and businesses, and advances our national security.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, of course, PGII was rolled out at the G7 Summit, so you know a lot about that, but the GCC will be partnering with us with the $3 billion to advance the PGII.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You’ll also hear President Biden welcome Iraq &#8212; concluding agreements with Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Jordan &#8212; to bring affordable energy to Iraq and diversify its supply, and ensure energy resiliency to meet the growing needs of its people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And the landmark agreement that was signed just last night in Iraq and the GCC Interconnection Authority &#8212; the President mentioned this last night in his remarks &#8212; will link Iraq’s electricity grid to the grids in the GCC, thereby providing the Iraqi people with newly diversified sources of electricity over the coming decade.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s important because much of Iraq’s electricity, as of now and for many years, is very much reliant upon gas from Iran.&nbsp; So diversifying Iraq’s electricity base and generation (inaudible) sources will benefit the Iraqi people, particularly as their demand continues to grow.</p>



<p>And this connection with the GCC &#8212; between Iraq and the GCC &#8212; has really been talked about for years.&nbsp; I think the President mentioned yesterday that it was discussed when he was Vice President but it was never able to get done.&nbsp; But over, you know, the last six months or so when, again, U.S. diplomacy relationships, partnerships, creativity was able to get these important agreements over the line for the first time last night.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So all of this, of course, builds on some of the Jeddah communiqué that was released last night, and that&#8217;s a joint statement between the United States and Saudi Arabia, outlining a strategic partnership between our countries over the coming decades with the aim of advancing a more peaceful, secure, prosperous, and stable Middle East region.&nbsp; And I think we put that out and also a pretty detailed factsheet about the number of initiatives and agreements that were reached over the course of many months.&nbsp; And some of those were finalized just last night.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So we want to build on that.&nbsp; It was important for us going forward here in this important region.&nbsp; And you&#8217;ll get more details on all of this as the day unfolds.&nbsp; And I&#8217;m sure we’ll have more to say to all of you afterwards as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I have time just for a couple of questions.&nbsp; I apologize.&nbsp; I have to get upstairs to prepare with the boss here for the day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; Thank you so much [senior administration official].&nbsp; We’ll go to the line of Aamer Madhani from the Associated Press.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, just on the point with the new intelligence that was released, to what extent &#8212; and you sort of were &#8212; sort of brushed on this though &#8212; you’re showing &#8212; it shows that Russia is making its bet on Iran.&nbsp; But none of the countries’ representatives at the summit have really sanctioned Russia.&nbsp; You know, the UAE has been sort of a financial haven for some of the oligarchs.&nbsp; Egypt remains open to Russian tourists.&nbsp; How is the President going to make the point, trying to sort of connect that Russia matters to them, using this intelligence?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Well, I think the entire GCC and eight or the nine countries around the table today voted in the U.N. General Assembly back in March.&nbsp; And if you read that resolution, extremely strong condemnation of Russia&#8217;s invasion and the importance of the territorial integrity of Ukraine and everything else.&nbsp; So I think that really spoke for itself.&nbsp; That was an important statement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think we have heard &#8212; I think if you go back to this region, say, I don&#8217;t know, 18 months ago, you heard an awful lot of just really significant hedging and, I would say, in many capitals, a real drift towards Russia and even China in many ways.&nbsp; Really, that has been arrested and, in many instances, very specific instances &#8212; not all which I can talk about &#8212; reversed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So we are &#8212; these countries have relationships with Iran [sic].&nbsp; They have relationships with China.&nbsp; That is natural.&nbsp; That is something that will continue.&nbsp; I’m sorry, relationships with Russia and relations with China is something natural and will continue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But when it comes to the partnerships and the partnerships of choice, and particularly in the security realm, but also in the trade, investment, commerce, tech realm, we heard from every capital around this region that their first choice, their priority, is the United States of America.&nbsp; And that is something that we are very much committed to following up on and finding areas in which we can partner.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So I think I&#8217;ll leave it at that.</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; We have time for one more quick one with [senior administration official].&nbsp; And then thank you to [senior administration official], who’s available and will take a few more questions right afterwards.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tyler Pager from The Washington Post, over to you.</p>



<p>Okay, we’ll go to the hand of &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Oh, Tyler is here.&nbsp; Good.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; Thanks, [senior administration official].&nbsp; Two quick ones.&nbsp; There were reports last night that the UAE detained a U.S. citizen, Asim Ghafoor, a former lawyer for Khashoggi.&nbsp; I&#8217;m wondering if the President is aware of this and whether he plans to bring up his case, or figure out what happened, today at the meeting with the GCC.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Yeah, we are aware of that.&nbsp; I will say there&#8217;s no indication that it has anything to do with Khashoggi (inaudible) or anything else.&nbsp; But we are aware of it.&nbsp; I can&#8217;t say whether the President will raise it, just given the facts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But we will certainly &#8212; I think they have the points on that about the importance of consular access and everything else.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But yes, to answer your question.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; We’ll go to the line of Barak Ravid.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And as a reminder to folks to use the “raise hand” feature on Zoom if you have a question.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, thank you for doing this.&nbsp; Can you give us some more details on the island deal and the overflight deal and some, you know, behind the scenes of how it went down in the last few days before the announcement?&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Thanks, Barak.&nbsp; I think this is another deal that has been talked about in past administrations and has been tried but never achieved.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s because it&#8217;s a complex piece of Middle East diplomacy.&nbsp; Obviously, Saudi Arabia and Israel do not have relations.&nbsp; Israel and Egypt are partners from the Camp David Accords, and the U.S. are observers to that arrangement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, basically, what this arrangement does: It allows the peacekeepers at Tiran Island for 40 years to depart.&nbsp; But we have negotiated between the parties alternative security arrangements that ensure the existing arrangements in place in freedom of navigation and everything else that everybody is very comfortable with this.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And these islands will now be developed for tourism, recreation, and peaceful pursuits.&nbsp; So it just is an interesting story not only of (inaudible) Middle East diplomacy and the unique role the United States of America plays.&nbsp; There’s no other country that can do things like this.</p>



<p>And also, just turning a page, a new chapter in Middle East history, if you know the history of, obviously, (inaudible) in this area, going back to the ‘67 war, which, of course, Barak, you know well.</p>



<p>So I think in the interest of time, I don&#8217;t have too much about, you know, the back-and-forth or details on this call.&nbsp; But happy to talk to you some other time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But I thought it was a &#8212; it was a good process.&nbsp; And it’s a good development because it’s something that has been wanting to get done some for some time, and it got done.</p>



<p>And together with another issue that’s been discussed for many years, but the overflight of Saudi airspace for all civilian carriers and including, of course, Israel, which is, we think, quite a breakthrough.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And part of this theme for a more integrated Middle East region &#8212; and that is a theme you’ll hear, I think, from the leaders today at the summit &#8212; and a Middle East region that is more interconnected with the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And something I said in, I think, my first background call &#8212; and I’ll end with this: There’s been a number of trips in the Middle East with secretaries and presidents when the Middle East was really the source of global &#8212; acute global challenges.&nbsp; And today, we face acute global challenges, to say the least, but the Middle East, right in this moment, is not a primary source of them.&nbsp; And in fact, countries are coming together to actually try to help address them.&nbsp; You saw that at the I2U2 Summit in Israel.&nbsp; You’ve seen that with some of the &#8212; again, with some of the breakthroughs, such as opening airspace to planes.&nbsp; That’s &#8212; you might think that’s a simple thing, but it’s never been done.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And in the summit today with nine leaders talking about food security, talking about investment in global infrastructures to protect all of our supply chains and make sure we’re diversified as we look to the future and position ourselves to the future of 5G, 6G, new technology development, new technology cooperation between these entrepreneurial societies such as UAE (inaudible).</p>



<p>So again, I’d just leave it there.&nbsp; But I think it&#8217;s a &#8212; it was a &#8212; it&#8217;s one example of this unique capacity the United States can bring.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And given the trends here in the region towards more integration and new partnerships, it&#8217;s something where I think we have a real comparative advantage to help.&nbsp; And so, we’ll (inaudible) because it also is squarely within American interests to do that.&nbsp; And that will be a theme of the President&#8217;s address today.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Okay, sorry, guys, I got to run, but thank you so much.</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Yeah, thank you so much, [senior administration official].&nbsp; And appreciate it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thank you to [senior administration official] who was able to take three to four more questions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just as a reminder to folks who joined us late of the ground rules, this call is held on background with contents attributable to a “senior administration official,” embargoed to the end of this call.</p>



<p>As a reminder to folks, if you have a question, use the “raise hand” feature.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With that, we&#8217;ll go to Alex Ward from Politico.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks so much for doing this and, [senior administration official], for being on the call.&nbsp; A 30,000-foot question: The President likes to say that the U.S. should lead not by the example of its power, but by the power of its example.&nbsp; But the example he set here was that, ultimately, the national interest matters more than the promotion and upholding of values.&nbsp; And so, should we take from this trip that this administration will be a realist administration &#8212; one where, you know, values, while mentioned and even strongly so, pale in importance of the cold pursuit of strategic interests?&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Thanks, Alex.&nbsp; You know, it&#8217;s difficult to say that values are going to be a key part of your foreign policy, and human rights matter significantly to us as a nation and certainly as an administration, and then not go overseas and not talk to leaders in candid, forthright ways about those concerns.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It would be backsliding if the President didn’t come to the region.&nbsp; It would be backsliding if he didn’t &#8212; wasn’t willing to sit and raise human rights concerns with foreign leaders around the world.&nbsp; And he noted for you last night that it was the very first thing he brought up &#8212; Mr. Khashoggi’s killing.&nbsp; The first thing.&nbsp; It wasn’t &#8212; it wasn’t an “oh, by the way.”&nbsp; It wasn’t an add-on at the end of the meeting.&nbsp; It was the first thing he brought up.</p>



<p>And so that very much is a powerful example of how he’s placing values in human rights right at the center.&nbsp; In fact, I’d go so far, literally, to say right at the forefront of our foreign policy.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a>And that doesn’t mean when you &#8212; when you do that, it certainly doesn’t mean that you are also eschewing opportunities to pursue tangible results.&nbsp; And [senior administration official] walked you through a lot of the tangible results that we’re going to see again today.</a></p>



<p>As a matter of fact, what the President believes is that the best way to achieve tangible results is to be known as a straightshooter and to be &#8212; and to be unafraid to be as candid and forthcoming with our partners as we can.&nbsp; That’s where partnerships really begin, and that’s where trust begins &#8212; not through disingenuous statements that aren’t backed up, but through actual &#8212; the actual delivery of our values overseas, the delivery of statement of our values overseas and being willing to bring those up.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So I would say it’s not only not &#8212; not dissonance from tangibly achieving pragmatic, real politic results, it’s actually part and partial of the ability to do that is critical to the ability to do that.</p>



<p><a>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Next, we’ll go to the line of (inaudible) from Asharq Al-Awsat News.</a></p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Good morning.&nbsp; Can you hear me?&nbsp;</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Yes, ma’am.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Good morning, [senior administration official].&nbsp; Thanks for doing this.&nbsp; A good question.&nbsp; Yesterday, the President spoke about responding &#8212; or approaching the security needs for Saudi Arabia.&nbsp; Can you elaborate a little bit about that?&nbsp;</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Yeah, I won’t get into too much detail because we’re obviously still in discussions with Saudi Arabia.<a>&nbsp; But I would &#8212; I do want to &#8212; you highlighted something that I do think is worth just another foot stomp, and that’s this idea of integrated air and missile defense.&nbsp; And you’ll see that coming out of the discussions today, one of the things that the President wants us to continue to pursue.&nbsp; This is not a new idea; this is something we’ve been working on for a while.<br><br>Our allies and partners here in the region, each of them have air and missile defense capabilities.&nbsp; We are responsible for contributing to much of those capabilities.&nbsp; And we believe &#8212; and in our bilateral discussions with several nations, we believe they believe &#8212; that there is great advantage to try and see if we can’t network some of those capabilities together.<br><br>And it’s a reflection of &#8212; well, I guess of three things.&nbsp;</a></p>



<p>One, terrific technological leaps and advances in air and defense capabilities that the United States is and will continue to share in the region.<br><br>Two, the growing threat from Iran’s ballistic missile capability, which continues to have nations here in the region increasingly on edge.&nbsp; We know they’re advancing that capability and at a clip that’s disconcerning &#8212; disconcerting, sorry.<br><br>And then the third thing, and [senior administration official] sort of touched on this a little bit when he talked about the Russian visit, but it’s the advances in Iranian UAV development.<br><br>They have a domestic production capability and an operational doctrine and concept that continues to advance and grow and improve.&nbsp; And you’re seeing them use UAVs more and more in the maritime environment, certainly on the ground in Iraq and in Syria.&nbsp; And those drones, as they become of greater range and of greater power and capability, greater payload delivery capability, continue to threaten all our neighbors here in the Gulf region.<br><br>And so that&#8217;s another reason why we believe a stronger networked integrated air defense system is probably (inaudible) &#8212; an integrated air defense capability is the right path forward.<br><br>Now, look, we&#8217;re also across the defense partnerships we have with nations all throughout the region, and we have robust defense partnerships with Gulf countries.&nbsp; We’re going to continue to work that bilaterally individually, whether &#8212; you know, I talked about air defense a little bit, but it’s not just air defense, it’s in the maritime domain.<br><br>As you know, our Fifth Fleet is headquartered in Bahrain.&nbsp; The Saudis are going to be taking command of a task force &#8212; Task Force 150 &#8212; under the U.S. Central Command’s naval component here in the Gulf.&nbsp; That’s significant.&nbsp; They’re going to be leading a taskforce up in the northern Persian Gulf.<br><br>So there’s an awful lot going on bilaterally and multilaterally that we’re going to continue to work on.</p>



<p>I don’t have, again, individual, like, arms sales to speak to today.&nbsp; That wouldn’t be appropriate anyway.&nbsp; But the takeaway is that all nations here are mindful of the increased threats, particularly posed by Iran, and we’re going to continue to work with them across a range of military capabilities to see if we can’t better net those capabilities together and better help defend not only themselves but each other.<br><br>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; We have time for two more questions.&nbsp; We’ll go to Andrew Restuccia from the Wall Street Journal.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; Just a couple quick things.&nbsp; On the Yemen ceasefire announcement, can you give us any more specifics &#8212; and apologies if this was asked already; I missed the beginning of the call.&nbsp; Could you give us any more specifics on where that goes from here, when we might see talks resume, and if anyone asked the Houthis about this idea of extending the ceasefire?<br><br>And then, also, on the integrated air defense issue, where does it stand in terms of including Israel in that?<br><br>And did the Saudis at all commit to a specific number in terms of how much OPEC+ will increase production at the meeting yesterday?</p>



<p><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; I won&#8217;t speak for Saudi Arabia and OPEC.&nbsp; I will just leave you with what the President said about &#8212; you know, that we&#8217;re hopeful in coming weeks we&#8217;ll see some additional announcements.<br><br>On the integrated air missile defense, again, we believe there&#8217;s great value in including as many of the capabilities in this region as possible.&nbsp; And certainly Israel has significant air and missile defense capabilities, as they need to.&nbsp; And &#8212; but we&#8217;re having these discussions bilaterally with these nations.&nbsp; And I don&#8217;t want to get ahead of where we are.<br><br>But I would just say that if you are &#8212; if you truly are trying to seek integrated air and missile defense, the more integrated, the better, the more powerful.&nbsp; So we&#8217;re obviously looking to have it be as robust as possible.<br><br>On the ceasefire in Yemen, again, <a>I&#8217;m loath to get ahead of</a> the future announcements, but what was noteworthy was that the Saudis committed to wanting to extend it themselves.&nbsp; So we&#8217;re on the 15th week now.&nbsp; This is the first &#8212; we&#8217;re on a first extension of a two-month ceasefire.&nbsp; And we have every indication now that the Saudis are interested in continuing that.&nbsp; And that was certainly welcome news.<br><br>I think I’ll let and be appropriate for me to let the Saudis speak to whatever discussions they&#8217;re having with the Houthis or how they&#8217;re handling it.&nbsp; I think it&#8217;d be more appropriate for them to speak to that.<br><br>But we obviously took as a very positive sign that the Saudi government is interested in pursuing that going forward.&nbsp; And I think, you know, we&#8217;ll &#8212; I&#8217;ll leave it to them to further characterize it.<br><br>I mean, we&#8217;ve now seen the longest time of relative peace in Yemen that we have in six, seven years.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s significant because not only are lives being saved every day, but, to your second question on this, you are allowing &#8212; you&#8217;re building confidence on both sides in each other.&nbsp; You&#8217;re building a little bit of trust.&nbsp; And you&#8217;re buying time and space for the possibility of negotiations to restart.<br><br>And as the President has said on numerous occasions, that&#8217;s really the only way to end this war, is through a negotiated settlement working through the U.N.&nbsp; We have not changed our position on the importance of that being the modality, that being the venue.&nbsp; And, again, the longer we can have relative peace where both sides aren&#8217;t shooting at one another, the better chances that we&#8217;re going to have to build the kind of &#8212; set the kind of conditions for there to be a negotiated settlement.</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; And for our final question, we&#8217;ll go to Ben Samuels from Haaretz.</p>



<p><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey, [senior administration official].&nbsp; Thanks for doing this.&nbsp; So the Saudi foreign minister essentially said last night that there won&#8217;t be full Israel-Saudi normalization until a two-state solution is reached.&nbsp; I know the administration has tried to sort of temper the timeline in terms of both full normalization and a two-state solution, but I&#8217;m wondering if you could clarify whether you think Israel-Saudi normalization is possible without reaching that sort of two-state solution?&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, what I would tell you is, you know, issues of norm- &#8212; first of all, we obviously support normalization, and we were excited by the announcement on airspace and, of course, the island announcement that [senior administration official] walked you through.  All of those are very positive signs.<br><br>But we know that these are sovereign decisions that these two nations have to make.  And we would not want to impose ourselves in that decision-making process or make those decisions for them.<br><br>The President said himself the other day, when asked about this, it&#8217;s going to take some time; we know that.  You&#8217;re talking about issues that are historic in nature and go back many, many, many years.  And so we understand that they&#8217;ve got to work this out in their own time.<br><br>At the same time, and this was why the President&#8217;s visit to Bethlehem was so important, we don&#8217;t &#8212; well, we don&#8217;t want to &#8212; we believe that working towards a two-state solution is important in and of itself.  It&#8217;s not in congruence with the idea of normalization, of course.  But all by itself, as an issue, a two-state solution still remains top of mind for President Biden when it comes to Middle East peace.<br><br>That&#8217;s why he wanted to go see President Abbas.  That&#8217;s why he wanted to reaffirm his commitment to it.  And that&#8217;s why he said, quite frankly, that when it comes to a two-state solution, both sides have to want it as well.  They have to be willing to work towards it.  And if they do, they&#8217;ll find no better friend than the United States of America.<br><br>Now, we were encouraged when Prime Minister Lapid called President Abbas.  We thought that was a good first step here, and we&#8217;d like to see additional steps taken.<br><br>But we&#8217;re going to stay committed to a two-state solution all by itself, because all by itself, it’s so critical to Middle East peace.</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Okay, those are all the questions we have time for.&nbsp; Again, thank you to all for joining this background call today.&nbsp; As a reminder of the ground rules, it was held on background, attributable to “senior administration officials.”&nbsp; The embargo on the contents are now lifted.<br><br>Thank you, everyone, and have a good day.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Eastern Atlantic States Regional Council of Carpenters<br><em>Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</em></em></p>



<p class="has-text-align-left"><br>THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Madam Leader, thank you for that introduction.  That means a lot to me.<br>I want to thank all of the leaders who are at this table.  Pennsylvania has so much at stake on this issue, and you all have not only been local and state leaders but national leaders in defending, fighting for, and protecting the rights of the American people.<br><br>And as Madam Leader said, we are looking at an extraordinary moment in the history of our nation and our democracy.<br>    <br>When the United States Supreme Court took a constitutional right, that had been recognized, from the women of America, that alone is so deeply harmful to our nation that prides itself on being a defender of freedoms and liberty &#8212; the very principles upon which we were founded.  And I don&#8217;t need to tell anybody in this city how it all started and what it meant from the beginning.<br><br>So I thank you for, on this Saturday morning, coming together so we can discuss what is at stake and what we are collectively prepared to do to fight for the rights of the American people when it comes to this issue about a woman&#8217;s right to make decisions about her own body and her life.<br><br>And it must be understood that on this subject, we are not asking anyone to compromise their beliefs or abandon their faith.  We are simply saying the government should not be in the position nor should the government have the power to replace its beliefs for those of the woman.  That&#8217;s what we are saying.<br><br>We are talking about a situation in our nation right now where states and so-called leaders are passing laws that would criminalize medical health professionals, healthcare providers.  We are talking about several states in our nation who will not allow an exception for rape or incest. <br> <br>And, Madam Leader, as you know and I know &#8212; as a former prosecutor who specialized, for a great part of my career, in crimes against women and children, including child sexual assault &#8212; we know what this means.<br><br>We have heard the more public recent stories about what this means to real people, real human beings, not to mention the stories that have not been told and have yet to be told.<br><br>So the impact of this moment and what so-called leaders are doing in states around our country is having a direct impact on so many people who should have a right to make the most intimate decision that one could make, to be able to make that for themselves and, if they so choose, in consultation with their loved ones, with their pastor, their priest, with their rabbi, but not having their government tell them what they&#8217;re supposed to do.<br><br>So, at a national level, we are going to do everything we can to push for &#8212; and we have some of the most esteemed members of the United States Congress at this table &#8212; what we can do at a national level to codify, which means put into law, the protections that Roe provided.<br><br>I think we all know and applaud our President for saying he will not allow the filibuster to get in the way of doing what is necessary in that regard.<br><br>And short of, then, what happens in terms of recognizing that the Court has acted, now Congress needs to act; there is also what we can do at a state and local level.  And so that&#8217;s why we are all convened today.<br><br>Here in Pennsylvania, I want to again thank the leaders who are at this table, because I know you are fighting against great odds and that you are undeterred and that you are standing in defense of, again, these most fundamental rights.<br><br>I want to also thank the Governor Wolf for what he has done in his role as a leader; the Attorney General, Josh Shapiro, for what he has done as Attorney General to fight for the principles and the people that have so much at stake right now.<br><br>And so, with that, I thank the press for being here.  And I bid you a good day.  And we are now going to begin our discussion.  Thank you all.<br><br>But we will find &#8212; start with a discussion with some of the leaders who are here at the table.<br> <br> END<br><br><br></p>

<p>President Joseph R. Biden Jr. met today with President His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, President of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, in a bilateral meeting during the Summit of the United States and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and Egypt, Iraq, and Jordan.</p>



<p>President Biden offered his personal condolences to President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed and all Emiratis on the loss of His Highness Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed al Nahyan. President Sheikh Mohamed thanked President Biden and the American people for their expressions of sympathy and for the visit of Vice President Kamala Harris and her delegation to Abu Dhabi in May.</p>



<p>President Biden offered his congratulations to President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed on his recent election as UAE President and conveyed an invitation for him to visit the United States later this year. The two leaders discussed a range of regional and global opportunities and challenges, which require close coordination between the United States and the United Arab Emirates as strategic partners.</p>



<p>In the realm of regional diplomacy, President Biden expressed appreciation for President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed’s personal leadership in breaking down barriers and forging diplomatic relations with Israel, as well as deepening cooperation with other countries in the region. The leaders discussed the U.S. role in helping to forge new economic, trade, and people-to-people relations among Israel, the UAE, Bahrain, and Morocco, as well as in deepening the ties among these states and Egypt and Jordan through new frameworks of cooperation.</p>



<p>In the defense realm, the two leaders affirmed their commitment to deepening the extensive security cooperation that has made both countries safer and been a major contributor to regional peace and stability. President Biden noted that the UAE is the only country in the Middle East to have deployed its military forces alongside the U.S. military in every international security coalition involving the United States since Desert Shield/Desert Storm in 1990-1991. The two leaders acknowledged the close and decades-long cooperation in their nations’ shared mission to counter terrorism and violent extremism.</p>



<p>President Biden recommitted to supporting the defense of the UAE against terrorist and other hostile acts such as the attacks targeting civilian sites in the UAE in January 2022. President Biden emphasized the centrality of the UAE as a strategic partner, and as a critical part of the security partnership among the states of the GCC, Egypt, Iraq, and Jordan. President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed confirmed that the United States is the primary security partner for the UAE, and the two leaders intend to accelerate and intensify discussions to further enhance these historic ties.</p>



<p>The leaders committed to continue the close cooperation that led to a truce in Yemen, now entering its fifteenth week. They expressed their appreciation for the effective work of the GCC, the U.S. Special Envoy, and the United Nations in achieving the truce, and committed their full efforts toward guiding the parties forward in a political process that can realize a lasting settlement to the conflict. President Biden emphasized the threats still emanating from Yemen and elsewhere and the importance of ensuring that the UAE has the best and most effective means to defend its homeland and people.</p>



<p>The leaders committed to continue to use their collective diplomatic standing to de-escalate and end conflicts elsewhere in the region. They discussed the importance of protecting the prospects of a two-state solution and of assuring that the benefits of the Abraham Accords also accrue to Palestinians. The leaders reaffirmed their support for Iraq and welcomed the landmark agreements to connect Iraq’s electricity grid to those of the GCC member states, as well as other projects further integrating Iraq into the greater region.</p>



<p>On economics, commerce, and trade relations, President Biden noted that the UAE is one of the fastest growing U.S. economic partnerships globally, the largest U.S. trading partner in the Middle East, and a significant investor in the U.S. economy. He welcomed the UAE’s economic initiatives throughout the Middle East and beyond, including its recent Free Trade Agreements signed with Israel, India, and Indonesia as well as new investments in Jordan and Egypt. The leaders tasked their teams with finding areas in which to deepen and expand commercial partnerships, as well as the negotiation of a broader strategic framework agreement between the UAE and the United States. President Biden recognized the UAE’s efforts to strengthen its policies and enforcement mechanisms in the fight against financial crimes and illicit money flows. Both leaders highlighted the extensive and enduring educational, cultural, and health partnerships between the two countries.</p>



<p>President Biden welcomed the UAE’s long-time commitment to global energy security as a reliable and responsible supplier, and recognized its leading role in advancing climate action, the energy transition and in developing clean energy technologies. President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed extended President Biden an invitation to attend the COP28 to be convened in the UAE in November 2023. Both leaders noted the important launch of the water and solar energy arrangement between Israel and Jordan with Emirati and American backing and investment as a model for future partnerships in the region. They asked their respective climate envoys, John Kerry and Sultan al-Jaber, to explore new opportunities in the climate and clean energy sphere to drive economic growth and sustainable development. They noted the UAE’s successful Dubai Expo 2020, which showcased the UAE as a convener of global events that promote sustainability, innovation, and dialogue.</p>



<p>President Biden also recognized the importance of the UAE as a force for change and global citizenship. He acknowledged the UAE’s leadership in promoting religious co-existence and challenging religious hatred through such initiatives as the Abrahamic Family House and the Hedayah Center. He expressed appreciation for the role the UAE has played in delivering thousands of tons of medical supplies to nations around the world during the COVID-19 pandemic and its response to calls for humanitarian assistance during natural disasters and conflicts around the region. The two leaders also noted the exceptional position of the UAE as a tolerant home to more than 200 nationalities and faiths coexisting in peace.</p>

<p>President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. met with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi today in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia to reaffirm their shared commitment to the U.S.-Egypt strategic partnership, consult on a broad range of global and regional security challenges, and advance the U.S.-Egypt relationship.  In celebrating the milestone of 100 years of U.S.-Egypt diplomatic relations, President Al Sisi and President Biden expressed their intention to meet again in the near future to further enhance the two countries’ multi-faceted partnership.  The two leaders renewed their commitment to the U.S.-Egypt Strategic Dialogue co-chaired by Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken and Minister of Foreign Affairs Sameh Shoukry and welcomed the continued implementation of its outcomes.<br> <br>Strengthening our shared security<br> <br>The decades-long U.S.-Egypt defense partnership remains a key pillar of regional stability.  Both Presidents affirmed the importance of this partnership, which serves the interests of both countries.  President Biden reiterated that the United States aims to continue to support Egypt in providing for its own defense, including through the continued provision of security assistance in consultation with the U.S. Congress.  Both Presidents affirmed their commitment to cooperate on counter-terrorism and welcomed the notable achievements of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS.  President Al Sisi expressed Egypt’s appreciation for military equipment and security assistance from the United States.<br> <br>Advancing economic prosperity<br> <br>Both Presidents expressed their commitment to furthering bilateral economic cooperation for the mutual benefit of the Egyptian and American people.  They decided to explore new ways to expand bilateral trade, increase private sector investments, and collaborate on clean energy and climate technology.  The leaders welcomed the recent U.S. GreenTech Mission to Egypt, the largest in history, and committed to launch the high-level Joint Economic Commission.<br> <br>The impact of the war in Ukraine<br> <br>The United States and Egypt underlined that peace, security and a multilateral, rules-based order lie at the heart of their longstanding partnership.  Recalling the March 2<sup>nd</sup> and March 24<sup>th</sup> United Nations General Assembly resolutions on Ukraine, which both voted in favor of, they reaffirmed their shared principles enshrined in the UN Charter, including the respect for international law, territorial integrity, and national sovereignty.  The two Presidents emphasized the need to refrain from the use of force, solve conflicts by peaceful means, and end violations of human rights in conflict areas.  The United States and Egypt share particular concerns over the severe global consequences that stem from the war in Ukraine, including on global supply chains and energy and commodity prices.  For example, the blockading of Black Sea ports has triggered rising food insecurity and levied significant economic pressures on Egypt. <br> <br>President Biden underscored U.S. support for the Egyptian people in responding to these challenges.  To this end, the United States commends Egypt’s consultations with the International Monetary Fund and supports the provision of additional funding to Egypt through the IMF’s Resilience and Sustainability Trust.  The United States also lends its full support to Egypt’s engagement with the World Bank to seek financing options to stabilize its economy and strengthen the well-being of Egyptian households, in particular through the Crisis Response Finance Package recently announced by the Bank.  President Biden conveyed that the United States is providing $1 billion in new assistance to address the food security situation in the Middle East, with $50 million specifically for Egypt. These funds aim to bolster food security and offset the effects of the disruption in agricultural supply chains and higher food prices due to the blocking of ports.  President Biden assured President Al Sisi that the United States will advocate for Egypt and its food security needs.<br> <br>Promoting regional stability<br> <br>The United States and Egypt are cooperating closely to mediate solutions to regional conflicts and promote peace.  The two leaders stressed that a two-state solution remains the only viable path to achieve a lasting resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and to realize a secure, prosperous, and dignified future for Israelis and Palestinians alike.  President Biden expressed support for Egypt’s vital leadership and historic role in promoting peace and an end to the conflict, thereby expanding the circle of peace between Israel and its Arab neighbors and globally, as well as preserving sustainable calm between Israelis and Palestinians. <br> <br>The two leaders underscored the need to implement United Nations Security Council resolutions 2570, 2571 (2021), reaffirming the necessity of holding presidential and parliamentary elections in tandem as soon as possible in Libya.  They emphasized the importance of the full withdrawal of all foreign forces, mercenaries, foreign fighters, and the pivotal role of the 5+5 Joint Military Committee in this regard, including the prompt development of timelines.  President Biden thanked President Al Sisi for Egypt’s role in helping to consolidate the Yemen Truce, particularly through facilitating commercial flights from Sana’a to Cairo, an important component of the UN-mediated truce arrangement.  The two Presidents committed to regular consultations to resolve regional conflicts and humanitarian crises in Syria, Lebanon, and Sudan.  Regarding the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), President Biden reiterated U.S. support for Egypt’s water security and to forging a diplomatic resolution that would achieve the interests of all parties and contribute to a more peaceful and prosperous region.  The two leaders reiterated the imperative of concluding an agreement on the filling and operation of the GERD without further delay as stipulated in the Statement of the President of the United Nations Security Council dated September 15, 2021, and in accordance with international law.<br> <br>Promoting human rights<br> <br>President Biden and President Al Sisi emphasized their mutual commitment to a constructive dialogue on human rights, which is an integral component of the strong U.S.-Egypt partnership.  They will continue to consult closely on ensuring the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms in political, civil, economic, social and cultural fields.  The two leaders reaffirmed the important role that civil society can play in these areas.<br> <br>Accelerating global efforts to tackle the climate crisis<br> <br>President Biden congratulated President Al Sisi for Egypt presiding over the 27<sup>th</sup> United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP 27) in Sharm El Sheikh in November 2022 and reaffirmed the United States’ commitment to a successful Conference.  The United States welcomes Egypt’s leadership in accelerating global ambition and action to tackle the climate crisis.  President Biden welcomed Egypt’s submission of its updated nationally determined contribution (NDC).  Both leaders emphasized their countries’ support for the Global Methane Pledge (GMP) and the new GMP Energy Pathway, which Egypt has joined with respect to the oil and gas sector.  The two leaders reaffirmed the U.S. and Egypt’s new partnership on Adaptation in Africa, which the U.S. and Egypt will co-lead, focused on delivering concrete initiatives that will improve people’s lives and help build resilience to a changing climate.  The leaders committed to convene the Joint U.S.-Egypt Climate Working Group as soon as possible.  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>‘Biden signs landmark bipartisan gun measure, says &#8216;lives will be saved’’<br>‘Wolf visits White House, says American Rescue Plan funds &#8216;greatly benefited&#8217; Pennsylvania&#8217;s workforce, COVID-19 economic recovery’<br>‘Intel CEO, Commerce secretary push for Congress to act on aid package’</em></p>



<p>This week, Americans are reading about how Members of Congress, state and local leaders, gun violence survivors, families, and advocates joined President Biden at a White House event commemorating the passage of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act – the most significant legislation to reduce gun violence in 30 years.</p>



<p>Governors, mayors, and local leaders joined Vice President Harris, Labor Secretary Marty Walsh, American Rescue Plan Coordinator Gene Sperling, and White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs Director Julie Rodriguez for a White House American Rescue Plan Summit. Following the half-day Summit, elected officials spoke to local reports about how more than $40 billion of American Rescue Plan funds have been committed to strengthening and expanding our workforce in the states.</p>



<p>Infrastructure Coordinator Mitch Landrieu also traveled to Milwaukee, Wisconsin and spoke with local press outlets about President Biden&#8217;s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which is rebuilding infrastructure in the Badger State by improving roads and bridges, replacing lead pipes to provide clean water, expanding high speed internet, and creating millions of good-paying union jobs that don’t require a college degree.</p>



<p>And Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo led a White House Regional Press Call for reporters in Indiana, Missouri and Ohio to underscore the urgent need for Congress to pass the Bipartisan Innovation Act, which will spur American manufacturing, strengthen our supply chains, and help lower costs for families.</p>
