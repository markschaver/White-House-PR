<p class="has-text-align-center">Via Teleconference</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">(March 9, 2022)</p>



<p>6:03 P.M. EST</p>



<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MODERATOR:&nbsp; Thank you, Grace.&nbsp; And, everyone, thank you for joining us this evening for today’s background call previewing President Duque’s visit to the White House.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today’s briefing is on background and attributable to “senior administration officials.”&nbsp; The briefing is embargoed until tomorrow morning, Thursday, March 10th, at 5:00 a.m.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For your awareness only and not for reporting, our senior administration officials are [senior administration official] and [senior administration official].&nbsp; For the purposes of this call, they are “senior administration officials.”</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With that, I’ll turn it over to our first senior administration official for opening remarks.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Thanks, [senior administration official].&nbsp; Good afternoon, everybody.&nbsp; As [redacted], I am particularly delighted to have &#8212; to talk about the meeting tomorrow between President Biden and Colombian President Iván Duque.</p>



<p>The meeting takes place at a time when we are navigating a uniquely complicated international environment following Russia&#8217;s unprovoked and unjustifiable aggression against Ukraine.&nbsp; We would recognize Duque’s strong remarks on this, rejecting the military intervention.&nbsp; And the two leaders are also meeting to commemorate what has been 200 years of diplomatic relations between our two nations.</p>



<p>I would note Colombia was the first former Spanish colony recognized by the United States, and the U.S.-Colombia relationship has been one of the closest of the Americas ever since.</p>



<p>It is, I would note, a country the President knows very well, dating back to his support for Colombia in the U.S. &#8212; for (inaudible) Colombia in the U.S. Senate; for his work as Vice President on expanding economic opportunity, supporting the people of Colombia achieve a lasting peace; and now, as President, working in partnership with Colombia to combat the pandemic, to advance an ambitious agenda on climate, and to work in partnership to address unprecedented levels of migration in a way that is orderly, secure, and humane.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The President, if you have followed him on Colombia, has said many times that Colombia is a keystone of the region, and that has remained true in recent years as we look to confront regional and global challenges.&nbsp; He&#8217;s been a &#8212; Duque has been an important voice on climate change, setting an ambitious commitment to declare 30 percent of Colombia&#8217;s territorial protected area by 2022, which will be an important legacy for the administration &#8212; for the Duque administration.</p>



<p>Colombia has also &#8212; I think one of the reasons that the President invited him to Washington was because he has a lot to teach the world on migration management, which my colleague will cover in greater detail.&nbsp; But I would say that when more than 2 million of the 6 million Venezuelans fleeing their country&#8217;s collapse found refuge in Colombia, Duque did not submit to politics or nativism, but he rose to the challenge by providing Temporary Protected Status to nearly 1 million Venezuelans living in Colombia &#8212; something that President Biden followed him on shortly thereafter taking office in January 20, 2021.</p>



<p>So, what is it that they&#8217;re going to talk about?&nbsp; The two leaders are going to talk about, obviously, where they want the relationship to go from here.&nbsp; They&#8217;ll talk, of course, about the issues of security cooperation and efforts to not just implement the 2016 Peace Accord, but to continuing efforts to combat those dissident groups of the Revolutionary Armed Forces and other transnational criminal actors, but also to protect Colombian elections from outside interference so that Colombians &#8212; and no one else &#8212; are the ones that determine the future of the country.</p>



<p>I would point to a recent visit by Undersecretary Toria Nuland to advance some of these issues.&nbsp; There was a visit last month as well between Deputy National Security Advisor Anne Neuberger and her Colombian counterpart to find ways to support Colombia’s efforts to bolster cybersecurity in advance of the election.</p>



<p>But also, Colombia is a NATO global partner, has been one that really has projected on a global stage.&nbsp; So, you could say that our security partnership is one that has bilateral regional and global implications in a positive way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The two leaders are also really going to review cooperation on an approach that was finalized last year, which has been a holistic approach to counter narcotics that looks at addressing some of the root causes of counter-narcotics &#8212; meaning, obviously, demand in the United States, in line with Biden-Harris, kind of, drug strategy and drug demand reduction strategies, efforts to promote rural security and development, but also issues of environmental protection to support the Colombian government&#8217;s efforts to make good on its commitment to protect 30 percent of its territory.</p>



<p>And, finally, in the &#8212; we’re now roughly 90 days from the Summit of the Americas, which will be the first time the United States hosts a summit since Bill Clinton launched the inaugural summit in Miami in 1994.&nbsp; So, 28 years later, a lot of work really still needs to be done to address the original vision of the summit to really secure the region&#8217;s democracies, ensure broad-based economic prosperity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And the presidents will discuss preparations for the summit.&nbsp; They will explore ways to work together along the areas that we&#8217;ve identified, which are promoting health and health security, promoting a green and equitable recovery to the pandemic, galvanizing a regional response to migration, and making democracy deliver in the Americas.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A final point here is: Since the meeting is going to take place two days before Colombia&#8217;s legislative elections, the president will talk about the need for there to be free and fair elections.&nbsp; He will, I think, recognize the strength of Colombian institutions and make clear that the United States will seek to work with whomever is elected as Colombia&#8217;s next president.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I will leave it there, and thank you.</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; We&#8217;ll now turn it over to our second senior administration official.&nbsp; Please, go ahead.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; And good evening, everyone.&nbsp; Thanks so much for joining us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Building off of what my colleague said, just to stay on migration cooperation: President Duque’s visit to the White House tomorrow is incredibly timely and important.&nbsp; As we’ve all been watching the situation in Ukraine, it&#8217;s a reminder of the plight of refugees and the responsibility of all countries and individuals to do their part in the humanitarian response.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this hemisphere, Colombia has been quietly doing this since the beginning of the Venezuela refugee and migration crisis.&nbsp; They’ve been true &#8212; a true example in the region: welcoming and hosting over 2 million Venezuelan neighbors; granting them Temporary Protected Status; being a leader, bringing other countries around to also participate in the humanitarian response and to follow their lead and being welcoming and providing support with integration.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They’ve been a consistent example, and they&#8217;ve also been a reminder that the international community needs to do more to support countries like Colombia on the frontlines of these refugee and migration crises.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, we&#8217;re seeing unprecedented migration across the entire Western Hemisphere.&nbsp; The U.N. estimates around 7 million between the Venezuela crisis and other outflows from Central America and the Caribbean.&nbsp; We know that we can&#8217;t continue with the status quo.&nbsp; This crisis is bigger than any one country and any one border.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so, as we&#8217;re, you know, working towards the Summit of the Americas, we&#8217;re looking to build off of the example of countries like Colombia; bring more support to countries, again, on the frontlines; bring leaders around the table to collectively look at how we can chart a new course to better manage migration in the Western Hemisphere.&nbsp; So that&#8217;ll be a central focus of the discussion tomorrow between our President and President Duque.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They&#8217;ll focus a lot on how we can work with partners across the region on humane migration management efforts to stabilize populations that are providing more support to middle-income countries that are hosting large numbers of migrants and refugees.&nbsp; We can collectively expand access to legal pathways.&nbsp; This includes resettlement, labor pathways, and family reunification program, access to asylum.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, again, we view Colombia as a partner and a leader on these issues.&nbsp; And we really look forward to the discussion tomorrow.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thank you.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks so much, guys, for doing this call.&nbsp; I was hoping, [senior administration official], you could address the Colombian Energy Minister’s recent comments.&nbsp; He gave an interview to the Financial Times where he questioned whether the United States would &#8212; he said it was difficult to justify if the United States was seeking to get Venezuelan oil.&nbsp; He went on to say it&#8217;s hard to understand how the United States would &#8212; if the United States just banned oil from Russia, that it&#8217;s hard to explain why you&#8217;d then buy it from Venezuela.&nbsp; That was my first question.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I was also hoping you could answer or talk about, kind of, Russian influence in the region.&nbsp; How will that come up tomorrow?&nbsp; Obviously, Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, you know, there are &#8212; have ties to Russia.&nbsp; But also, you know, Argentina and Brazil, the presidents were in Moscow, you know, just weeks before the invasion.&nbsp; So I wanted to &#8212; you know, is it important for the United States to kind of stand next to the Colombian President and talk about countering Russian influence?</p>



<p>And lastly, you mentioned the Summit of the Americas.&nbsp; I was just wondering if you could say whether Guaidó will be invited or if you expect that Juan Guaidó will be invited to the Summit of the Americas.&nbsp; Thanks a lot.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; Thanks, Franco.&nbsp; So I &#8212; hard for me to qualify the Energy Minister’s questions, since he would be an energy expert.&nbsp; What I&#8217;ll just say that, you know, again, we&#8217;re in a unique international environment where the United States needs to advance its national security and its economic interests around the world.&nbsp; And, frankly, that diplomatic outreach, regardless of whether or not we like a leader or the leaders have been democratically elected, is really fundamental toward advancing our national security interests.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a>The question about oil is really &#8212; I think it&#8217;s speculation, given that there was a Wall Street Journal, I think, article.&nbsp; [Redacted.]&nbsp; So I &#8212; hard for me to really kind of comment on that decision that really hasn&#8217;t been &#8212; hasn&#8217;t been made.&nbsp;</a></p>



<p>I think the second question I think you asked was on Russia&#8217;s influence.&nbsp; So, there&#8217;s been a Russian, I think, outreach.&nbsp; And if you&#8217;ve been watching, you&#8217;ve seen that there&#8217;s been a lot of travel by Russian officials to Latin America and the Caribbean in the months prior to and following the invasion of Ukraine.&nbsp; Some of that is bluster.&nbsp; Some of that is tangible and concerning.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And what I’ll say is twofold.&nbsp; Number one is that I think Russia seeks a Cold War-like response from the United States, when we&#8217;re dividing the region into those who are friends and our allies.&nbsp; And I think that would &#8212; that would certainly be a mistake.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve diplomatically, since the beginning of the administration, reached out to countries across the political spectrum to try to advance a set of common national security interests, and we&#8217;ve done that successfully across the board.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Where, you know, there are areas of concern, you know, we’ve used all our tools &#8212; diplomatic and economic and otherwise &#8212; to either help support and defend our allies.&nbsp; And I would say, Colombia has expressed significant concerns at the level of disinformation &#8212; clearly or apparently &#8212; directly from Russia into Colombia.&nbsp; Also, kind of an increase in cyberattacks, I think, intended to disrupt the election.&nbsp; And we provided technical assistance and support to try to ensure that Colombian institutions are able to defend their infrastructure and to push back on disinformation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But, again, the &#8212; I say this a lot that the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean aren’t chess pieces on a board where the United States and Russia are competing for power.&nbsp; They&#8217;re countries that get to choose where their national security interests lie.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I &#8212; but I think the invasion of Ukraine by Russia has been a defining moment where the majority of the region has rejected military intervention.&nbsp; But I think it&#8217;s really going to be up to the countries of the region to decide what&#8217;s ultimately in their national security interests.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Oh, and on Guaidó.&nbsp; Look, at the &#8212; the summit preparations are just underway.&nbsp; What we have made clear is we are inviting the democratically elected leaders of the Americas, and &#8212; but we&#8217;re still ironing out the details of who particularly will get an invitation and what that will look like.&nbsp; And I&#8217;ll say, frankly, that&#8217;s also something that we&#8217;ll have the Department of State weigh in.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But once we are ready to issue formal invitation, certainly that will be something that will be made public.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, [senior administration official].&nbsp; Just two things.&nbsp; I mean, it seems clear that even the talks with the Venezuelans have somehow soured the meeting between Presidents Duque and Biden for tomorrow.&nbsp; Duque has already criticized this (inaudible), calling it an emboldenment of Maduro’s dictatorship and that it will prolong Venezuelans’ suffering.&nbsp; Is this just bad timing?</p>



<p>And second, is the administration considering declaring Colombia a Non-NATO Major Ally as some in Congress have suggested?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; So, hi, Sergio.&nbsp; Thank you for that question.&nbsp; I would say Duque’s remarks at CERAWeek were very measured.&nbsp; Certainly, he is entitled to his view, but I think I would disagree that it has soured the meeting, because we&#8217;ve had conversations with Ambassador Pinzón and I&#8217;ve been in touch with President Duque directly.&nbsp; And I predict the two leaders will have an excellent conversation.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I’d certainly recognize that Colombia is very concerned about the situation in Venezuela and the threat it presents to Colombia, given the safe haven Venezuela provides to legal armed groups.&nbsp; And the operations that they organize into Colombia from Venezuela is a grave concern that we share.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The efforts to secure the release of detained Americans and to encourage a return to the negotiation table is the right approach.&nbsp; I think when you ask the families of Jorge Fernández and Gustavo Cárdenas whether or not we should have traveled to Venezuela, I think you know what answer you will get.&nbsp; And that is just something that is the responsibility of the U.S. government.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, the international community and even representatives of the opposition have urged us to convey directly to the regime the importance of returning to the negotiating table for dialogue.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s what we did.&nbsp; We kind of laid out what would be possible in terms of alleviation of international pressure should talks produce ambitious, concrete, and irreversible outcomes.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And that you saw initial reports from both Maduro and Guaidó of willingness to return to dialogue.&nbsp; Indeed, we see that as the only option forward for Venezuelans to get together and talk about the future of the country and how to get to a restoration of the democratic order.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So a Major Non-NATO Ally &#8212; I have no news to report.&nbsp; I’d just say, you know, watch, I think, the outcome of the meeting.&nbsp;</a></p>



<p>But again, the two leaders know each other; they get along very well.&nbsp; They met first in 2018.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But you know, that&#8217;s why presidents get together, is to work over and talk through issues of agreement and disagreement.&nbsp; But I would say that the will is good and, I think, the eagerness to continue working together is high.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi.&nbsp; Good evening.&nbsp; Thank you so much, [senior administration official], for doing this.&nbsp; I wanted to ask, first: Can you say whether President Biden will try to explain in the meeting to President Duque his decision to launch these talks with Maduro?&nbsp; Is he hoping to convince him that this is the right thing to do?<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And secondly, on the release of the two American citizens, can you say definitively that there wasn&#8217;t any quid pro quo involved that &#8212; anything that Venezuela might have gotten in exchange?&nbsp; And have you made any progress toward a deal with Venezuela to restart oil sales to the United States?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; So just on the issue of quid pro quo, there was none.&nbsp; <a>We made very clear that &#8212; when we went down there that &#8212; frankly, [redacted] traveling down there was the first visit by a White House official to Venezuela since the inauguration of Hugo Chávez in the late ‘90s.&nbsp;</a><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And that &#8212; I think that gesture, that engagement, for us was something that, you know, we saw as an important signal and that we asked them to &#8212; you know, to reciprocate that signal by releasing &#8212; or by liberating detained Americans.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You know, but I&#8217;ll say it&#8217;s the &#8212; it was a product of months of work by Special Envoy for Hostage Affairs, Roger Carstens.&nbsp; And I could say, I think unquestionably here, that the conversations that Roger, that Ambassador Jimmy Story, and that I had &#8212; at no point was there an offer of oil in exchange for the detention of Americans.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At no point we would do that.&nbsp; It would certainly risk, kind of, the Americans that are currently detained and send a signal around the world that the United States is going to barter oil for people, which is &#8212; which, frankly, is wrong.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The question of &#8212; on the question of oil, I think maybe to your question about talks &#8212; so there are no &#8212; I would say there are no talks between us and the regime.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We traveled down there to secure the release of detained Americans and to urge a return to the negotiating table, which is something that, again, the international community and even representatives from the opposition had urged us to do.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no dialogue between us and the regime.&nbsp; Dialogue really has to be between the Venezuelan people on the future of the country.&nbsp; And we&#8217;ve made clear that we are ready to lift international pressure on the basis of progress at those talks.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In regards to oil, look, the decisions about oil that have been widely reported are ones that I think are being considered on a much broader level and that it is not something that we&#8217;ve committed to or bartered with or, frankly, that, you know, we&#8217;re &#8212; again, we discussed many things with them, but the focus throughout was the detained Americans and a return to the (inaudible).&nbsp; And that was the objective of the visit.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you so much.&nbsp; [Senior administration official], I wanted to ask you regarding what you have just explained, about pressure to the regime &#8212; if this in any way means that the main and preferred channel of communication of the White House and the National Security Council is not the opposition, it&#8217;s not Juan Guaidó.&nbsp; And why the trip was made without talking to Guaidó and the Venezuelan embassy here &#8212; if those are the people that you have recognized as legitimate representatives of the Venezuelan people.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Yeah, so, look, to be clear, diplomatic engagement is something that we&#8217;re going to do broadly.&nbsp; In fact, Ambassador Jimmy Story engages with a broad cross-section of Venezuelan civil society in addition to the interim government.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We did inform the Unity Platform of our visit, but kept the information, I think, very restricted to not have the news break right away, given the sensitivities around the discussions of &#8212; around securing the release of detained Americans.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I mean, that&#8217;s what I could say.&nbsp; But the channel is one where &#8212; I guess I wouldn&#8217;t answer in terms of like, “What is our channel for communication?” but rather, “Who do we support?” What I&#8217;ll say is that the United States supports the Venezuelan people&#8217;s right to determine their own future.&nbsp; We see a negotiated outcome as really the only way forward toward a peaceful restoration of democratic order in the country.&nbsp; And we stand quite squarely behind those Venezuelans who seek democracy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You know, as opposed to, I think, previous ways to characterize U.S. objectives, there is no plan and there was never any plan, even under the previous administration, to invade Venezuela.&nbsp; We&#8217;re not looking for a military removal.&nbsp; What we&#8217;re looking for is a level playing field where Venezuelans get to decide where who their leaders are and get to decide the direction of the country.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, thanks for having this.&nbsp; So if these were talks just about releasing American prisoners, what&#8217;s behind the timing?&nbsp; Why now?&nbsp;</p>



<p>And also related, to what extent were the Colombians &#8212; was the Colombian government consulted and/or informed that this visit to Venezuela was going on?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Yeah, so, I mean, the timing was that there was a &#8212; I think the invasion of &#8212; the Russian invasion of Ukraine significantly, I think, changed the international environment significantly, and we just saw a window to travel.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And this was something that was really in the works for months, following an original visit by Roger Carstens, who had been &#8212; remained in contact with interlocutors down there on behalf of &#8212; on behalf of the family.&nbsp; He saw a window to go down, and we &#8212; you know, he thought it would be of value to have White House representation, given the asks that were coming from the regime, but also, I think, asks that we were getting from the international community in the opposition to convey to the regime the importance of returning to the negotiating table.</p>



<p>Where we could &#8212; did we consult with the Colombians beforehand?&nbsp; We &#8212; you know, we informed them immediately thereafter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But, again, this is &#8212; this is the United States going into a country to secure the release of American citizens.&nbsp; And we will &#8212; we will do that in furtherance of national security interests, but also in furtherance of the families.&nbsp; We&#8217;re not going to ask other countries for permission to reunite Americans with their families.</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; All right, thank you again.&nbsp; And a reminder: Today&#8217;s briefing is on background and attributable to “senior administration officials.”&nbsp; The briefing is embargoed, again, until tomorrow morning, Thursday, March 10th, at 5:00 a.m.</p>



<p>And with that, this call is concluded.&nbsp; Thank you very much for join&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p>Today, the Biden-Harris Administration applauded House passage&nbsp;of&nbsp;the bipartisan funding bill, which delivers for the American people through critical investments in a range of bipartisan priorities—from securing historic support for the Ukrainian people, to launching the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health, to investing in education, to tackling crime. The legislation will reduce costs for American families and business, support our historic economic recovery, advance equity, and further restore U.S. leadership abroad. The bipartisan funding bill would also end a damaging series of short-term continuing resolutions that for months have undermined the government’s ability to meet pressing challenges.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We are making these historic and necessary investments in a fiscally responsible manner. The deficit dropped last year for the first time since 2015 and is currently on track to drop by more than $1 trillion compared to last year—the largest-ever one-year reduction.</p>



<p>The Senate should send the bipartisan funding bill to the President’s desk for signature without delay. Critical investments in the important legislation include:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Delivering Historic Assistance to the Ukrainian People.&nbsp;</strong>As President Biden and bipartisan members of Congress have made clear, the United States is committed to supporting the Ukrainian people as they defend their country and democracy. The bipartisan funding bill includes $13.6 billion in humanitarian, security, and economic assistance for Ukraine and neighboring countries – augmenting the $1.4 billion in assistance the United States has provided to Ukraine since 2021. These resources will mean additional defense equipment for Ukraine, lifesaving humanitarian assistance for the Ukrainian people, and additional support for U.S troop deployments to neighboring countries.&nbsp;<br></li><li><strong>Launching the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health.</strong>&nbsp;The bipartisan funding bill includes $1 billion to help launch the President’s Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health—a bold initiative to help speed transformational research to improve the health of all Americans, with an initial focus on cancer and other diseases such as diabetes and Alzheimer’s.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Tackling Gun Crime and Other Violent Crime. </strong>President Biden has been clear that we need to fund the police with the resources and training they need to protect our communities. The bipartisan funding bill bolsters Federal law enforcement capacity with an increase of $554 million over 2021 for Department of Justice law enforcement. This includes $1.5 billion for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) to expand its capacity to tackle gun crime. The funding bill also increases the budget for the COPS Office by $126 million for a total of $512 million, and provides $50 million for a new Community Violence Intervention program at DOJ.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Making Education More Affordable.</strong> The bipartisan funding bill includes $17.5 billion for the Title I program – a $1 billion increase over 2021, the largest increase in over a decade &#8212; to ensure that schools with a high percentage of students from low-income families have the resources they need to deliver a high-quality education to all of their students. The bill also makes college more affordable by increasing the maximum Pell Grant by $400 above 2021 – the largest increase in the maximum award in over a decade – for millions of low- and middle-income students. </li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Tackling Climate Change and Advancing Environmental Justice. </strong>The bipartisan funding bill will provide a record $3.2 billion, an increase of $338 million over 2021, for the Department of Energy to build clean energy projects and boost clean energy manufacturing. It also includes $100 million in resources dedicated to advancing environmental justice at the Environmental Protection Agency, and provides an increase of $776 million for the Department of Interior and increases funding at the U.S. Department of Agriculture to prevent wildfires. </li></ul>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Belweder Palace<br>Warsaw, Poland</em></p>



<p>12:57 P.M. CEST<br> <br>PRESIDENT DUDA:  (As interpreted.)  Your Excellency and distinguished Madam Vice President of the United States of America, distinguished ladies and gentlemen: This is a very important moment in our relations.  But, first and foremost, under these circumstances which we are facing right now in Europe, behind our Eastern border, in Ukraine &#8212; friendly to us and with us &#8212; where the Russian troops are carrying out a barbarious aggression and murdering innocent people, murdering civilians, bombing maternity hospitals from which, under dramatic circumstances, wounded women right before labor &#8212; are being carried out.<br> <br>None of us has ever expected that we would be able to see such things in the 21st century.<br> <br>Especially it is a great satisfaction to all of us here in Poland that Madam Vice President of the United States of America, Ms. Kamala Harris, is here with us in Warsaw, in our country.<br></p>



<p>And she&#8217;s demonstrating that strength and depth of the atlantic &#8212; transatlantic and Allied bond, demonstrating decisive engagement and commitment of the United States to the security of NATO&#8217;s eastern flank and to Europe as a whole.<br> <br>Let me stress very forcefully: There is no doubt whatsoever that together with the United States and our other Allies within the framework of the North Atlantic Alliance, and along with the entire free and honest world, we stand with Ukraine.  We stand with Ukraine, and we will try to do our best to make sure that Ukraine can be defended.<br> <br>Thank you very much, Madam Vice President, for coming.  Thank you for our meetings today, for the conversations that we have had.<br> <br>We had a meeting just a couple of minutes ago.  We had a private meeting, a tête-à-tête meeting.  And we also met with Polish and American delegations.  We discussed all the important topics.  And I highlighted very forcefully how important it is, and I thanked also for the position of the President of the United States, Mr. Joe Biden.  I thanked for the position of Madam Vice President and her team.  But I also thanked for the position of the U.S. Congress. <br> <br>I thanked for this necessity and, actually, the imposition of effective sanctions on the Russian Federation.  The United States is in the vanguard of those sanctions, and, speaking honestly, these sanctions are working.<br> <br>Above all, thank you also for all the support which is being provided to the fight in Ukraine &#8212; to Ukraine, which is defending itself.<br> <br>Thank you for the humanitarian assistance, which is being supplied there.<br> <br>And to you, Madam Vice President, I would like to thank for the involvement of all the organizations and of all the NGOs that are being involved in providing assistance &#8212; humanitarian assistance.  Also, they&#8217;re providing medical aid.  They&#8217;re providing equipment for children, for wounded, for the sick.<br> <br>My wife Agata is involved in this as well.  And I know that, in those respect, she is in cooperation with various institutions from the United States.  She is in contact with the First Lady of the United States, Jill Biden.<br> <br>I’m very happy that this Polish-American cooperation is developing.  But I&#8217;m pleased that it serves to provide common aid to the fight in Ukraine and common aid to all those who are suffering, all those who need this assistance from us.<br> <br>And today, I shared with Madam Vice President &#8212; I described the situation that we are facing.  I said that, today, for a number of days actually, we have been receiving refugees from Ukraine in Poland.  This number is close to 1.5 million persons who have come to us.  And I&#8217;m addressing my compatriots right now.  I was proud to tell Madam Vice President that all those people have not been sent to any camps and refugee camps.  They have been accepted and received by Polish families in Polish homes.  They are accommodated in Polish hotels, in Polish spa resorts, in Polish motels.<br> <br>Most often, however, they&#8217;re accommodated with private people.  They have been received by ordinary Polish people who feel in their hearts that they should extend a helping hand to the people in need.<br> <br>And I thank you so much for this, to my fellow Polish people.  This is a reason to be proud for us, for the Polish authorities.  And I&#8217;m very, very much grateful to you for that.<br> <br>At the same time, I asked Madam Vice President for support, as it is quite obvious that such a huge refugee crisis is a surprise for Poland.  And it is a complicated situation for Poland, for the Polish authorities in the era of the crisis.  The prices are growing &#8212; of fuel prices are growing; generally, the prices are growing.  That is why we do need this support.  And I&#8217;m going to be hugely grateful for any form of support because we have to survive this difficult time.<br> <br>And we have to do that by helping our neighbors, because that is extremely important right now. <br> <br>However, first and foremost, we discussed security issues.<br> <br>The presence of Madam Vice President here in Poland is yet another demonstration of U.S. presidents &#8212; of U.S. presence in Poland, next to the U.S. troops that we have here, next to U.S. defensive systems that are protecting our skies today and our land.<br> <br>We also have with us here today the political representation, the top-level political representation of the United States, led by Madam Vice President. <br> <br>And this is a very clear political message where important &#8212; most important things are happening today on the global stage in Europe: We have to rescue Ukraine.  All of us are acutely aware of that.  All hands should be on board.  Ukraine needs to be helped.  And we have to stay united in that respect.  We need to stand together in this respect within the North Atlantic Alliance, keeping solidarity, speaking absolutely with one voice, just as we have to stand together in the European Union and in all the other international communities.  We have to impose more sanctions on Russia.<br> <br>We cannot accept such military activities, which bear the characteristics of the features of a genocide, because I don&#8217;t think that anybody is in any doubt if hospitals are bombed, if hospitals are bombed where pregnant women are staying, where children are staying, when ordinary people are killed, where bombs are dropped, when missiles are launched into residential houses where there are no military installations, then this is an act of barbarity bearing the features of a genocide.  It aims at eliminating and destroying a nation.  Hence, we have to stand and present a very tough stance here as representatives of the free world. <br> <br>And Poland stands here together with the United States of America, just like &#8212; I have no doubt about that &#8212; our Allies stand with Ukraine and all the honest authorities and states, especially democratic states.<br> <br>And at the end of our conversation, I mentioned the fact that we want to boost our security also on our own here in Poland.  Also, thanks to the purchase of American equipment for our armed forces, there are already ongoing programs such as Patriot programs, such as HIMARS program, the program of the purchase of F-35s, or the recently started program &#8212; the purchase of Abrams tanks for Poland. <br> <br>I asked Madam Vice President that those programs should be accelerated as far as this as possible, because we want to provide this state-of-the-art equipment to our armed forces as soon as possible. <br> <br>If there is such a need &#8212; I think everybody can see that.  We do not need to comment on this situation.  We are able to witness the dramatic scenes unfolding in Ukraine every day in the media.  You can see those horrific &#8212; horrifying scenes. <br> <br>But at the same time, we&#8217;re able to witness the huge heroism and incredible determination of the Ukrainian people.  And we stand at the side of the Ukrainian people.  We’re going to support them with all our strength, but at the same time providing the security of our countries which is of crucial importance to us.<br> <br>Once again, thank you very much, Madam Vice President, for coming to Warsaw.  Thank you for this demonstration that we stand together and that we are a huge Euro-Atlantic community of freedom and security.  Thank you. <br> <br>I’d like to give the floor to Madam Vice President of the United States of America.  Madam Kamala Harris.<br> <br>VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  Thank you, President Duda, and for the warm welcome under unfortunate circumstances, given what is happening in Ukraine, our friend.  But I thank you for the warm welcome and for the very constructive and productive conversations we had today as part of our ongoing dialogue and friendship that spans generations. <br> <br>I would like to also speak directly to the Polish people.  I have shared with your president that, under his leadership &#8212; and your leadership has been extraordinary &#8212; the world has been watching Poland, Mr. President, your leadership and the leadership of the people of your country.  And we&#8217;ve witnessed extraordinary acts of generosity and kindness.  We have seen through images on the television &#8212; looking at images of ordinary people doing extraordinary things in support of the dignity and the wellbeing of perfect strangers.<br> <br>So I, first and foremost, want to express the thanks for the people of the United States to you, Mr. President, on behalf of our President, Joe Biden, and to the people of Poland for what you are doing every day.  It really represents the best of who we are.<br> <br>We are here and I am here in Poland today as part of an enduring, longstanding friendship and commitment between the United States and Poland based on shared values and priorities. <br> <br>I am here, standing here on the northern flank &#8212; on the eastern flank talking about what we have in terms of the eastern flank and our NATO Allies and what is at stake at this very moment.  What is at stake this very moment are some of the guiding principles around the NATO Alliance and, in particular, the issue and the importance of defending sovereignty and territorial integrity, in this case, of Ukraine.<br> <br>As President Duda has described, we have been witnessing for weeks &#8212; and certainly just in the last 24 hours &#8212; atrocities of unimaginable proportion.  A maternity hospital, a children&#8217;s hospital, where we have witnessed pregnant women who were there for care, for one reason &#8212; being taken out, because they required care because of an act of violence &#8212; unprovoked, unjustified.<br> <br>I am here, in Poland, as an expression of the enduring and important relationship between the United States and Poland that, again, has been longstanding, but, in particular on the issue of Ukraine, is unified and is clear.  We will do everything together, in partnership, in solidarity, to support what is necessary at this very moment in terms of the humanitarian and security needs of Ukraine and the Ukrainian people.<br> <br>Today, we discussed, Mr. President, many issues that relate to our special bond also, because, I will say as a point of personal privilege, we have a substantial Polish American community in my hometown of Los Angeles but throughout the United States, who understands the relationship that we have on many levels, including the diplomatic but also cultural relationships that span generations. <br> <br>And so, through all of that and in the spirit of those relationships and our shared commitments &#8212; our shared commitment to the importance of international norms and rules &#8212; you and I discussed today many important topics, in particular as it relates to the eastern flank.  And we talked specifically about what we cared deeply about in terms of our commitment &#8212; the United States commitment to Article 5. <br> <br>I&#8217;ve said it many times; I will say it again: The United States commitment to Article 5 is ironclad.  The United States is prepared to defend every inch of NATO territory.  The United States takes seriously that an attack against one is an attack against all.  We are here today to restate that commitment, but also do what we must do to reinforce our support of Poland and our Allies through the EU and NATO Alliance.<br> <br>In particular, as it relates to troop deployment, we have recently deployed an additional 4,700 American troops to Poland.  That&#8217;s on top of the years of rotation of about 5,000 American troops in Poland. <br> <br>We are pleased to have announced this week that we have directed two Patriot missile defense systems to Poland.  And today, I can announce that we have delivered those Patriot systems to Poland.  We do this as a reminder and as a demonstration of our commitment to the security of our Allies and our commitment, in particular, to Poland at this moment in time.<br> <br>As it relates to the people of Ukraine: They have suffered immensely.  When we talk about humanitarian aid, it is because, yes, the assistance is necessary, but what compels us also is the moral outrage that all civilized nations feel when we look at what is happening to innocent men, women, children, grandmothers, grandfathers who are fleeing everything they&#8217;ve known.  Our outrage, which compels not only our security assistance but our humanitarian assistance, is rooted in the fact that also we support the people of Ukraine who have shown extraordinary courage and skill and their willingness and, yes, ability to fight against Putin’s war and Russia&#8217;s aggression.<br> <br>So, today we are also announcing, in pursuit of what must happen, which is to provide humanitarian assistance, that we will give another $50 billion &#8212; the United States will &#8212; through the U.N.’s World Food Programme to assist with humanitarian aid. <br> <br>The President and I also talked about the fact that, as he mentioned, Poland has taken, in just a very short period of time, in excess of one and a half million refugees in from Ukraine.  And that has put an extraordinary burden on Poland and the people of Poland.  And so, we will continue with the support that we can give you, Mr. President, in terms of the work that you and the people of Poland have been doing to bear this burden, but in a way that really has been with such grace<br>and such generosity.<br> <br>We also are pleased to have shared with the President what our United States Congress has done, which is there is a commitment now of $13.6 billion in human- &#8212; humanitarian and security assistance that will be then distributed and shared with Ukraine and the people of this region and Europe, all again understanding that this moment in time requires both a humanitarian response as well as security assistance.<br> <br>And today, I&#8217;m also pleased to say that we are in ongoing discussions with Poland and our Allies about the effectiveness of sanctions thus far and going forward.  As we have announced in the United States, we have, through the United States Department of Justice, started a task force to do what is required and necessary and appropriate in terms of investigations as it relates to any criminal activities and behaviors on behalf of institutions and individuals, including oligarchs. <br> <br>We talked &#8212; the President and I &#8212; about the effectiveness of the sanctions we&#8217;ve seen thus far, in terms of the courage and the bold action that has been taken through the NATO Alliance to do what is necessary to send a clear signal that there will be, as we promised, severe cost and consequence for Russia&#8217;s aggression to the point that we have now seen a freefall of the ruble, to the point that we have now seen that Russia&#8217;s credit rating has been rated as junk, and what we know to be real economic consequence to Russia because of Putin&#8217;s war.<br> <br>As you know, the President of the United States also made the decision to do what was necessary in terms of the purchase of Russian oil in the United States. <br> <br>Again, we will continue to focus on this issue, keeping in mind that this is a moment that requires severe and swift consequence for Russia&#8217;s aggression against Ukraine.<br> <br>And I&#8217;ll close by saying what we say every day for these last weeks, which is we stand with the people of Ukraine, that we admire their courage, and that we are aligned in our support of their sovereignty and territorial integrity. <br> <br>Thank you, Mr. President.<br> <br>Q    (As interpreted.)  My name is Żaklina Skowrońska.  I represent Polish Television.  I would like to ask my question to both Madam Vice President and Mr. President.  In what way has this brutal attack of Russia against Ukraine impacted Polish-American relations?  Antony Blinken, State Secretary, during his last visit to Poland was saying that the Polish-American friendship has never been so strong in history as it is now.  Is it going to translate also on the permanent military presence of the United States in Poland?  Thank you very much.<br> <br>VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  It cannot be said too frequently or strongly enough: The relationship between the United States and Poland is a deep, enduring, and strong one and, dare I say, has become even stronger when we have been faced as a world with such adversity.  I think we all know, even in our personal lives, adversity really, truly, can present the real measure of an individual or a relationship.  And what we have seen without any doubt is that this friendship and relationship between the United States and Poland is a strong one.<br> <br>PRESIDENT DUDA:  (As interpreted.)  Ladies and gentlemen, answering your question, I want to go a little bit back into history &#8212; or deeper into history.  Let me put it in the following way: When I started my service as President of the Republic of Poland in 2015, I was perfectly aware of the fact that an aggressive Russia, like President Lech Kaczyński was saying in Georgia in 2008, would not stop only attacking Georgia in 2008 and attacking part of Ukraine in 2014.  I knew that this appetite, this imperial appetite will grow. <br> <br>And if the world does not react to that &#8212; if the world does not react, if the North Atlantic Alliance does not stand up, does not present a tough stance, then we will see more attacks from Russia &#8212; to which perhaps, sooner or later, also my country, Poland, would fall victim to.<br> <br>And when I started as President of Poland, I knew that I had to do everything that I could to protect Poland from such a scenario.  One has to use very clear and strong words here in the presence of Madam Vice President of the United States.  Those who understood well what I was saying back then, speaking about the Russian threat, were precisely the representatives of the United States, were the representatives of Barack Obama administration and the President himself back then, the U.S. generals as well.<br> <br>And precisely thanks to their support, we were able to obtain the North Atlantic Alliance presence on the eastern flank, were able to execute the strengthening of the eastern flank for the first time since we joined NATO in 1999.<br> <br>It was precisely in NATO Summit in Warsaw, through, first and foremost, the decisions of the U.S. President and his team, but also through the decisions of other Allies whom we were able to convince, has led to putting this presence on the eastern flank of the Alliance and, symbolically, in Poland.<br> <br>The United States is the framework nation.  At the same time, the U.S. soldiers came here and started the rotational presence in Poland.  It is a rotational but also a persistent presence, enduring presence.  It is a back-to-back presence.  Soldiers change, but the U.S. armed forces are present on our soil all the time.  And that was a breakthrough.<br> <br>If we recall the words of President Lech Kaczyński, which I quoted many times and who said those words to me back in 2008, he said, and I quote: “Andrzej, when U.S. soldiers are on our soil, when U.S. military installations are on our soil, when U.S. military equipment is put in our soil, then the whole world will be able to see that we are no longer a Russian sphere of influence.”  This is a true friendship.<br> <br>As Madam Vice President remarked today, “A friend in need is a friend indeed.”  That is why I&#8217;m really happy that today, when we are in need and when the NATO eastern flank is in need, the United States, by the decision of President Joe Biden, has deployed additional troops.  The U.S. is deploying more troops, and the U.S. is announcing the strengthening of this presence in our part of Europe and also in Poland, because this is precisely the understanding of the geopolitics of strategic goals that have to be achieved by this geopolitics and by the free world.  This is the understanding of the security.<br> <br>Is Polish American presence today, if we look at the last couple of years, stronger than ever?  Yes, Polish-American friendship, for sure, over the last seven years of my presidency is stronger than ever before.<br> <br>And today&#8217;s presence here today in Warsaw of Madam Vice President Kamala Harris is yet another strong evidence of that, just as the presence of all the representatives of Mr. President Joe Biden&#8217;s administration here recently on our soil.<br> <br>And also, this is evidenced by the frequency of contacts that I have with the President of the United States.  We frequently talk and discuss the most important security-related topics and our mutual relations.<br> <br>Yes, of course, whenever we speak about great politics and friendship, this is this friendship and great politics.  And this is the friendship between states for sure.  This is the friendship between Poland and the United States of America.  It is very strong right now &#8212; the strongest perhaps ever in history.<br> <br>WHITE HOUSE AIDE:  The next question will come from Nandita Bose of Reuters.<br> <br>Q    Hi, Madam Vice President.  Thank you for &#8212; and President Duda.  Thank you for taking my question. <br> <br>President Zelenskyy has strongly asked for better air power in recent days.  And my question is: What kind of alternative plans does the United States have to get materials to help Ukraine defend itself, especially now that you have declined Poland&#8217;s offer on jets?  Can you give us some specifics on what you discussed with the Polish leaders on this issue, Madam Vice President?<br> <br>And one for President Duda.  The United States says, Mr. President, it was not consulted before you made the offer to make your jets available to the United States.  Is that accurate?  And did Poland act unilaterally in making an offer?  If yes, why?  Especially now that you have spoken about the strong relationship that U.S. and Poland has shared over the years.  Thank you.<br> <br>VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  I want to be very clear: The United States and Poland are united in what we have done and are prepared to do to help Ukraine and the people of Ukraine, full stop.<br> <br>In terms of the work that the United States has done thus far, we have, as you know, given military, humanitarian, and security assistance, and that is an ongoing process.<br> <br>As I mentioned earlier, Congress &#8212; the United States Congress has now made a decision for 13-plus billion dollars of United States &#8212; of U.S. money to go to Ukraine and our European allies to assist in terms of both their security and humanitarian needs.<br> <br>We have also, just this past week, given $240 million in security assistance delivered to Ukraine, and that’s on top of the $1 billion in just the past year that we have sent to Ukraine.<br> <br>I can tell you that the issue facing the Ukrainian people and our Allies in the eastern flank is something that occupies one of our highest priorities in terms of paying attention to the needs, understanding it is a dynamic situation and it requires us to be nimble and to be swift. <br> <br>I mentioned being swift in terms of accountability and consequence.  We also fully appreciate we must be swift in terms of providing assistance where we can be helpful.  And we will continue to do that.<br> <br>Q    Can you (inaudible) plans, especially in light of the issue with Poland on jets?<br> <br>VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  Well, we&#8217;re making deliveries every day, in terms of what we can do in terms of assistance and, in particular, when you look at what we&#8217;ve been doing, as it relates to anti-tank and anti &#8212; defense systems.  That is an ongoing process, and that&#8217;s not going to stop to the extent that there is a need. <br> <br>Thank you.<br> <br>POLISH AIDE:  (No translation provided.)<br> <br>PRESIDENT DUDA:  (As interpreted.)  One moment.  I need to give an answer as well. <br> <br>Madam, that situation is extremely complicated, because we are all saying that there is a fight going on in Ukraine for independence, for sovereignty, for freedom, and for survival.  And all of us support, with all the strength we have, the people of Ukraine. <br> <br>It is not only the military.  Also, the people of Ukraine have taken to arms to defend their homeland.  It is not only men; it’s also women who fight on the frontline shoulder-to-shoulder with men in order to defend their country.  And we have no doubt whatsoever that they need help and assistance.<br> <br>Let me say something more.  We accept that they have the right to demand this assistance from the international community.  They can demand this support from NATO.  We are providing them humanitarian assistance and material assistance the best we can.  We are trying to do our best. <br> <br>Some expectations were addressed in a very strong and unequivocal way, also towards us &#8212; towards Poland.  However, we are members of the North Atlantic Alliance.  And as far as security-related issues are concerned, we have to look at these not only through our own lens &#8212; through the prism of the security of Poland &#8212; but we also have to adopt the perspective of the security of NATO as a whole. <br> <br>So, in a nutshell, we have to be a responsible member of the North Atlantic Alliance.  That is why there were requests addressed to us.  Those requests were addressed to us by the Ukrainian side and also, to a certain extent, by the media. <br> <br>We behaved in such a way as a reliable member of NATO should behave &#8212; a member of NATO who does not want to expose NATO to any difficult situation.  On the other hand, we, as members of NATO, also wanted and want to look for ways of support for the fight in Ukraine.  And that is why we formulated statements, together with the Polish government &#8212; so myself as president, together with the Polish government. <br> <br>And this statement or this declaration was announced by the Polish Minister of Foreign Affairs.  It talked about the Polish possibilities &#8212; military possibilities of assisting Ukraine.  Simply, we decided to put those jets at the disposal of NATO, not expecting anything in return, because we stressed very clearly that, as a gap filler for the donated equipment, we were able to buy something that we would need as a replacement.  And we, ourselves, we’re ready to provide our equipment free of charge. <br> <br>But we wanted NATO as a whole to make a common decision so that Poland remains a credible member of NATO, not a country who decides on its own on important issues which impact the security of NATO as a whole &#8212; which would impact the security of all members of NATO &#8212; also our neighbors who are part of NATO &#8212; members of NATO. <br> <br>Thank you.<br> <br>Another question? <br> <br>POLISH AIDE:  Maja Wójcikowska, TVN24.<br> <br>Q    Madam Vice President, each day we can see death and unimaginable suffering of the Ukraine people caused by decisions made by Vladimir Putin.  My question is: Will the U.S. support an international investigation into war crimes committed by Russia in Ukraine?  And can you see any political future for Putin? <br> <br>(As interpreted.)  This is also the question to the Polish President. <br> <br>VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  Okay, I’ll go. <br> <br>PRESIDENT DUDA:  (Points to himself.)<br> <br>VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  You go this time, please.  (Laughs.)<br> <br>Q    (Inaudible) I will start with Madam Vice President.<br> <br>VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  (Laughs.)  Okay.<br> <br>PRESIDENT DUDA:  (Points to Vice President Harris.) <br> <br>Q    Thank you.  I appreciate that.  (Laughter.)<br> <br>VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  Not at all.  I &#8212; we are very clear: The NATO Alliance is stronger and Russia is weaker because of what Putin has done.  That is very clear to us. <br> <br>And when it comes to crimes and violations of international norms and rules, we are also very clear that any intentional attack on innocent civilians is a violation.  The U.N. has set up a process by which there will be a review and investigations, and we will of course participate as appropriate and necessary. <br> <br>But we all watched the television coverage of just yesterday.  That&#8217;s on top of everything else that we know and don&#8217;t know yet, based on what we&#8217;ve just been able to see.  And because we&#8217;ve seen it or not doesn&#8217;t mean it hasn&#8217;t happened.<br> <br>But just limited to what we have seen: Pregnant women going for healthcare being injured by &#8212; I don’t know &#8212; a missile, a bomb in an unprovoked, unjustified war, where a powerful country is trying to take over another country &#8212; violate its sovereignty, its territorial integrity, for the sake of what?  Nothing that is justified or provoked.  Absolutely there should be an investigation, and we should all be watching.  And I have no question the eyes of the world are on this war and what Russia has done in terms of this aggression and these atrocities.  I have no doubt. <br> <br>PRESIDENT DUDA:  (As interpreted.)  It is obvious to us that in Ukraine, Russians are committing war crimes.  I hope that also in the future it will be obvious for a court investigating those issues who bears responsibility for that.<br> <br>Now, please remember that the refugees from Ukraine are coming to us right now.  And right now, as we speak, there are people crossing our border who witnessed their houses destroyed, who saw their neighbors being killed, who saw hospitals being bombed, who saw civilians being shot at, children being shot at.  These are proofs.  These are the reports of witnesses, and they also have those proofs on their smartphones.  If you look at those footages, it just makes your blood curl.  Such scenes are happening today, and they have been happening over the last days in Ukraine, and their perpetrators are Russians. <br> <br>A group of prosecutors has come to us delegated by the court to look at the facts of this case.  They are collecting evidence.  We, as Poland, try as much as we can to give them best &#8212; the best possible conditions for work and then to fulfill this very difficult task. <br> <br>Let us remember, the witnesses are here.  There is a lot of evidence &#8212; the footages as I mentioned.  We have those proofs and the evidence.  All of that is being collected.  The work is ongoing.  And I do believe that it is going to result in very serious indictment acts. <br> <br>And I do believe that the war crimes &#8212; criminals will be sentenced &#8212; those responsible for the war that is happening in Ukraine right now as a result of this (inaudible) Russian assault.<br> <br>WHITE HOUSE AIDE:  And the final question will be from Asma Khalid of NPR.<br> <br>Q    Thank you.  Thank you, Madam Vice President.  I wanted to ask you about some reporting that my colleague here in Poland noticed.  He recently spoke with the mayor of the largest border town, who told him that the refugee system is essentially not set up for this, that it will collapse.  It&#8217;s an improvised system that can work for maybe two weeks, but not indefinitely.  And I&#8217;m wondering what the United States is going to do more specifically to set up a permanent infrastructure.  And relatedly, is the United States willing to make a specific allocation for Ukrainian refugees? <br> <br>And for President Duda, I wanted to know if you think and if you asked the United States to specifically accept more refugees.<br> <br>VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  Okay.  (Laughs.)  A friend in need is a friend indeed.  (Laughter.) <br> <br>PRESIDENT DUDA:  Okay.  I’ll go first.  Okay, so this time &#8212; (as interpreted) &#8212; Madam, the situation is very complex.  This is what I was saying today and I discussed this at length with Madam Vice President Kamala Harris.  I said, in a very blunt way, that today we are seeing a refugee crisis.  It is unfolding because Poland is still able to receive &#8212; it is all the time able to find the accommodation for those people who are coming to us all the time. <br> <br>But we have got almost 1,500,000 people who have come to us over the last couple of days.  So it&#8217;s been 10 days.  We have received more than 1 million people within 10 days.  Never before have we witnessed such a situation.  So this is something totally new to us, and we are grappling with this huge challenge.  Our entire society is facing up to this challenge.  I have already expressed my gratitude to the Polish people for their wonderful position in this very difficult situation &#8212; that they are so openhearted. <br> <br>But we are aware that the problem is growing and that this problem is increasing.  We have to somehow handle it, and we do not have the experience.  Therefore, yesterday, I had a long conversation with Mr. António Guterres, Secretary General of the United Nations organization.  And I flagged out that problem to him.  I described to him the situation &#8212; how it looks, how it develops.  I described to him the reaction of the Polish society, of the Polish authorities, how we have been handling with this problem.  But I told him that unless we receive international assistance, then, given further influx of refugees to Poland on this scale, this will end up in a refugee disaster.  And I asked for help &#8212; both the material assistance, financial assistance &#8212; so that we are able to solve this in Poland. <br> <br>I also asked for expertise, for the know-how, because the U.N. has got experts who have seen a multitude crisis of this dimension, and I&#8217;m sure that they have worked out methods of how to handle it.  And I&#8217;m sure they know how to solve the problems, which ensue due to such a crisis situation. <br> <br>And this is something that I described in detail also today to Madam Vice President.  I said that the assistance of the United States in this respect is invaluable to us, and we would be very much grateful if we could use this assistance as soon as possible. <br> <br>Furthermore, we discussed the refugees from Ukraine who have got relatives and families in the United States, and who would be willing &#8212; at least for the time when the war is still waging, they would like to visit those families, to stay with their families in the United States, and to wait there until the war is over and then come back to their homes.<br> <br>I asked to speed up and simplify the procedures for such people &#8212; the consular procedures to be simplified for those people who would like to leave for the United States, to give the opportunity to these people to see their families as soon as possible, to be reunited with their families, to help them to survive this time. <br> <br>So we are acting, and we are looking for international support because, indeed, the vast majority of Ukrainian refugees are coming to our country.  Frankly speaking, that is because, first of all, we are a big country.  And also, the material status of an ordinary citizen of Poland is for sure much better than the material status, the living conditions of an ordinary Ukrainian citizen, although we are not among those wealthy countries of Western Europe, but our living standards have increased over the last couple of years in Poland. <br> <br>But they are coming because I believe that also the &#8212; it is their belief that thanks to the presence of NATO armed forces, thanks to the presence of our Allies from NATO &#8212; from Canada, from the UK, from Romania, and from other countries whose soldiers are deployed in Poland &#8212; they believe that Poland, due to that presence, is a safe country, a country which is not going to be attacked, a country where you can safely wait out this difficult situation.<br> <br>VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  As the President said, we did discuss this issue.  And I started by thanking the President in Poland and the people of Poland for what they have done.  And I will restate what I said earlier this afternoon: They&#8217;ve shown extraordinary generosity and kindness and courage.  And they have &#8212; there have been some here who have relatives who have arrived from Ukraine, but I think there are many more who are taking in perfect strangers with barely a lot to give but giving a lot nonetheless. <br> <br>So, we recognize that, and we recognize the burden that it places on the government of Poland, on the president, and the infrastructure of this country; when you look at &#8212; as the President said, over one and a half million people coming within two weeks, virtually.  Unprecedented if you track and look at refugee flows over the history of time from regions of conflict.<br> <br>So the United States is absolutely prepared to do what we can and what we must to support Poland in terms of the burden that they have taken on that I think all of us who understand the moral obligation we should feel to help people who are fleeing harm and seeking refuge; the burden we should all be prepared to take on to support those people who are fleeing their home when they don&#8217;t want to leave.<br> <br>In terms of what we are doing in the United States, we will then take this in terms of what we can do to support and look at those Ukrainians who want to come to the United States.  What we&#8217;re seeing thus far is large parts of that population who are fleeing Ukraine, who desire to stay in Europe. <br> <br>You probably know that we have made a decision as it relates to TPS &#8212; the Temporary Protected Status.  So for Ukrainians that are in the United States whose visa may expire or has expired: If they were in the United States before &#8212; I believe it&#8217;s March; I don&#8217;t have the exact date &#8212; they will be able to stay; they won&#8217;t be required to leave, even though their visa has expired because, of course, we would not send them back to what is a warzone. <br> <br>And the bottom line is that I have stated the position to the President this afternoon.  As we have said many times through our work collectively in the U.N., through NATO, we will support Poland in terms of the burden it is facing and our collective responsibility to ensure the safety and wellbeing of these refugees.<br> <br>POLISH AIDE:  (As interpreted.)  This concludes our press conference.  Thank you very much for your participation, ladies and gentlemen. <br> <br>VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  Thank you.<br> <br>END                 1:43 P.M. CET<br> </p>

<p>Today’s economic data tells the tale of two recoveries.</p>



<p>Our jobs recovery remains strong.&nbsp; New unemployment claims remain low, as jobs are created at a record level.&nbsp;The rate of people on unemployment insurance is the lowest since 1970 – more than 50 years.&nbsp; &nbsp;And, private sector job growth is strong, boosted by the steps we took in the American Rescue Plan a year ago this week.</p>



<p>At the same time, today’s inflation report is a reminder that Americans‘ budgets are being stretched by price increases and families are starting to feel the impacts of Putin’s price hike.&nbsp;A large contributor to inflation this month was an increase in gas and energy prices as markets reacted to Putin’s aggressive actions.&nbsp; As I have said from the start, there will be costs at home as we impose crippling sanctions in response to Putin’s unprovoked war, but Americans can know this:&nbsp; the costs we are imposing on Putin and his cronies are far more devastating than the costs we are facing.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p>I know that higher prices impact a family’s budget, which is why I am fighting to bring down the everyday prices that are squeezing Americans. Last week, in coordination with our allies, the U.S. secured a release of 60 million barrels of oil from our strategic reserves. My Administration is pushing for investments so we can manufacture more in America, strengthen our supply chains, and move goods to market at lower cost. I’m promoting competition to make sure big corporations are offering consumers fair prices, and I’m pressing Congress to pass my plan to lower the cost of essentials like prescription drugs and energy.</p>



<p>Finally, I want to be clear:  we can do all this, and reduce the huge federal budget deficit that I inherited from my predecessor.  Earlier this week, we learned that after reducing the deficit last year &#8212; for the first time since 2015 – CBO reported that we are on track to cut the deficit this year by over $1 trillion – the largest one year reduction in the deficit in US history. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p><strong><u>The American Rescue Plan (ARP) made essential investments to expand health care coverage and reduce costs for millions of Americans.</u></strong>&nbsp; The COVID-19 pandemic laid bare critical shortcomings in our health care and health insurance systems, and the ARP shored up vital gaps by providing more affordable coverage to millions of American, including many who lost their jobs over the last two years. &nbsp;Today, the Biden Administration is announcing a state-by-state breakdown of health insurance enrollment changes during this year’s Open Enrollment Period (OEP).&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><u>Total Enrollment in this year’s OEP was 14.5 million:</u></strong> During the 2022 OEP,14.5 million Americans enrolled in a Marketplace plan through HealthCare.Gov or a State-Based Marketplace. <strong><u></u></strong></p>



<p><strong><u>Coverage increased by 21% due to the American Rescue Plan:</u></strong> The increase to 14.5 million people represented a 21% increase over 2021 due to the expansions of cost-saving subsidies in the American Rescue Plan.</p>



<p><strong><u>Americans saved $800 per person last year, and thousands per family because of American Rescue Plan affordability measures.</u></strong> As a result of the American Rescue Plan (ARP), families were able to keep more money in their pockets, with actual savings of $67 per month per person in premiums – that’s more than $800 each year per person for groceries, child care, or other essentials. &nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><u>5.8 million <em>new</em> consumers enrolled during the 2021 Special Enrollment and Open Enrollment periods</u></strong>, according to data from HHS. Between 2016 and 2019, 3.6 million Americans lost coverage.</p>



<p><strong>The ARP reduced the cost of health care coverage by:</strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>Ensuring that consumers eligible for financial assistance through premium tax credits had at least a couple plans to choose from </strong>that won’t cost more than 8.5% of their household income on their Marketplace plan premium per year.</li><li><strong>Expanding the number of people eligible to save money on health care coverage</strong> by temporarily expanding eligibility for premium tax credits for those previously excluded from financial assistance.</li><li><strong>Increasing affordability for low- and middle-income Americans</strong> by increasing the size of tax credits.</li><li><strong>Addressing racial health inequities by expanding coverage and reducing costs.&nbsp; </strong>Increased affordability and health insurance coverage expansion allowed historically uninsured communities – especially those who have faced significant health disparities – to access coverage, thereby improving opportunities for health care during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.</li></ul>

<p>During her trip to Warsaw, Poland, today, U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris announced nearly $53 million in&nbsp;new&nbsp;humanitarian assistance from the United States government, through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), to support&nbsp;innocent civilians&nbsp;affected by Russia’s unjustified invasion of Ukraine. This additional assistance includes support to the UN World Food Program (WFP) to provide lifesaving emergency food assistance to meet immediate needs&nbsp;of&nbsp;hundreds of thousands affected by the invasion, including people who are displaced from their homes and who are crossing the border out of Ukraine. In addition, it will support WFP’s logistics operations to move assistance into Ukraine, including to people in Kyiv.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This assistance builds on the United States’ announcement less than two weeks ago of nearly $54 million in humanitarian assistance to provide critically needed health supplies, food assistance, high thermal blankets, and other relief.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The United States is the&nbsp;largest&nbsp;provider of humanitarian assistance to Ukraine and has provided $159 million in overall humanitarian assistance to Ukraine&nbsp;since October 2020, including&nbsp;nearly $107 million in&nbsp;the past two weeks in&nbsp;response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. This includes food, safe drinking water, shelter, emergency health care, and winterization services to communities affected by ongoing fighting. To date, two million people have been forced to flee Ukraine due to the conflict, and an estimated one million are displaced inside Ukraine. &nbsp;At least 12 million people are in need of humanitarian aid across Ukraine.&nbsp;The United States continues to stand with the people of Ukraine and will continue to work to meet immediate needs and save lives.&nbsp;</p>
