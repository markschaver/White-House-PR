<p>Today, some of Florida’s most vulnerable students and families are more fearful and less free. As the state’s shameful “Don’t Say Gay” law takes effect, state officials who claim to champion liberty are limiting the freedom of their fellow Americans simply to be themselves. Already, there have been reports that “Safe Space” stickers are being taken down from classrooms. Teachers are being instructed not to wear rainbow clothing. LGBTQI+ teachers are being told to take down family photos of their husbands and wives—cherished family photos like the ones on my own desk.<br> <br>This is not an issue of “parents’ rights.” This is discrimination, plain and simple. It’s part of a disturbing and dangerous nationwide trend of right-wing politicians cynically targeting LGBTQI+ students, educators, and individuals to score political points. It encourages bullying and threatens students’ mental health, physical safety, and well-being. It censors dedicated teachers and educators who want to do the right thing and support their students. And it must stop.<br> <br>President Biden has been very clear that every student deserves to feel safe and welcome in the classroom. The Department of Education will be monitoring this law, and any student or parent who believes they are experiencing discrimination is encouraged to file a complaint with the Department’s Office for Civil Rights. Our Administration will continue to fight for dignity and opportunity for every student and family—in Florida and around the country.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Private Residence<br>Los Gatos, California</em></p>



<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Shannon, for all that you are, for the work that you are doing, for the work that everyone here is doing to fight for so much of what is right now at stake.<br> <br>Kevin, Coco, to your whole family: Thank you for hosting us.  And to everyone here, I see some longstanding friends, and we&#8217;ve been in this fight together, many of us &#8212; I&#8217;m a proud Bay Area kid &#8212; (laughs) &#8212; (applause) &#8212; we have been in this fight together, so many of us, for quite some time. <br> <br>And I think sometimes, because we are so committed, it can feel as though this is never going to end.  Will we ever get there, the place we are determined to go?  And if we get there, how long can we be there before things erode or turn back?  And it can be extremely dispiriting.  It can make us sad.  It certainly can make us angry.<br> <br>But, you know, many of you have heard me say this &#8212; many years I&#8217;ve been saying this.  And it&#8217;s to paraphrase Coretta Scott King.  And she famously said: The fight for civil rights &#8212; which of course is the fight for equality, for freedom, for liberty, for justice &#8212; the fight for civil rights must be fought and won with each generation. <br> <br>And I think she had two points in mind when she said that.  One is that it is the very nature of this fight that we collectively have been in on the variety of issues that Shannon just articulated and more.<br> <br>I mean, I just &#8212; I was telling Kevin and Shannon and Coco, I just, very proudly, held as the Vice President of the United States of America, at the official residence of the Vice President of the United States of America, a Pride reception at the house &#8212; (applause) &#8212; where we talked about our trans kids, where we talked about what is happening in terms of “Don&#8217;t Say Gay” in Florida and all over this country.<br> <br>But all of that to say, this fight that we have been in, so many of us for so long, what she said &#8212; Coretta Scott King &#8212; is that it must be fought and won with each generation, because she understood it&#8217;s the very nature of this fight that whatever gains we make, they will not be permanent.  It&#8217;s the nature of it.  It&#8217;s the strength of it in that we know when we do it, it empowers, it uplifts.  But there is also, coexistent with the strength of it, fragility &#8212; meaning that if we are not vigilant, we certainly can&#8217;t take it for granted; we must be vigilant.<br> <br>And so the second point, I think, of her admonition is then: Understanding it won&#8217;t be permanent, understanding we must be vigilant, understanding it is the nature of it &#8212; point number two &#8212; do not despair.  Do not be overwhelmed.  Do not give up.  It&#8217;s just the nature of it.<br> <br>I look at my friend, our Lieutenant Governor Eleni Kounalakis &#8212; (applause) &#8212; who is an extraordinary fighter.  She&#8217;s here with us today.  And I think about all the warriors that we have.  All of us, we’re built for this.  We&#8217;re built for this.<br> <br>But I too &#8212; you know, we read and &#8212; we read &#8212; many of us read the leaked opinion.  And then, when it happened &#8212; you know, when you know something is going happen and then it happens, it’s just a different thing altogether.<br> <br>I was actually on Air Force Two, flying from Washington, D.C., to go to Illinois &#8212; Aurora, Illinois &#8212; to meet up with Lauren Underwood, a member of Congress &#8212; (applause) &#8212; who I worked with when I was in the Senate, when, in the Senate, I sponsored the Maternal Health Act and the Momnibus that is all about recognizing the fact that in this nation of ours, we have the distinction &#8212; the sad distinction of having one of the highest rates of maternal mortality of any so-called developed nation.<br> <br>So, Lauren and I, for years, have been working on this issue.  And I&#8217;m very proud that as Vice President, I&#8217;ve been able to, for the first time in the history of our country, put this issue on the stage of the White House &#8212; this issue of maternal mortality &#8212; to say: States, instead of two months of Medicaid coverage for postpartum, it should be 12 months; to say &#8212; (applause) &#8212; that we need to recognize the bias that is in the healthcare delivery system, which results in the fact that Black women are three times more likely to die in connection with childbirth, Native women twice as likely, rural women one and a half times likely.  And so let&#8217;s deal with that.<br> <br>All of this stuff we&#8217;ve been working on. <br> <br>So I was on Air Force Two to go meet Lauren.  In my plane, I had Dick Durbin, the Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, a great longstanding fighter.  And I guess, as fate would have it, this was who I was with and this is where I was when on the TV, on the plane, they announced that the Court had made the decision on Dobbs.  The irony of it, right?<br> <br>And like all of us, it was &#8212; it knocked the wind out of us<br>that the United States Supreme Court would, for the first time in our nation, in the history of jurisprudence, take a constitutional right that had been recognized and take it from women.<br> <br>I know we all feel so strongly about this.  You know, my mother &#8212; many of you knew her &#8212; was &#8212; she had two goals in her life: to raise her two daughters and end breast cancer.  My mother was a researcher, a scientist.  She fought for women&#8217;s health her entire life.  I grew up, from a young child, listening to her battle to ensure the dignity of women in the healthcare delivery system.<br> <br>And we look at what just happened, and we understand what it means not just theoretically, not just in the context of history, but as Shannon and I have discussed just before we came out, rightly, in the context of all these young women, girls &#8212; women &#8212; who are in a state of utter fear right now, feeling alone and isolated, not to mention what is happening with these proponents of these pieces of legislation in that decision who are daring to insinuate that there would be some righteous judgment associated with the predicament and the decisions women must make.<br> <br>I gave a speech when we first heard about the leaked opinion.  I was at EMILY&#8217;s List.  And I said, and I&#8217;ll keep saying: How dare they.  How dare they.  (Applause.) <br> <br>So, we must fight. <br> <br>You all probably heard that the President, rightly, today said the filibuster will not stand in the way of what we need to get done.  (Applause.)  And so that is part of it. <br> <br>And then part of it is what we need to do in terms of the assistance and the care that we will give those who are in need.  We, as Californians, luckily have leadership who understand the crisis and the issue and the need for all of us to step out and be there for those in need.<br> <br>But we&#8217;re also going to have to focus on what&#8217;s happening in these other states &#8212; not one part of our battle to the exclusion of the other.<br> <br>And that brings us to part of why we are here today, which is to support the DNC and its work, because elections matter.  Elections matter.  Federal elections matter.  Who&#8217;s in Congress, if we&#8217;re going to get the Women&#8217;s Health Act passed, if we&#8217;re going to pass voting rights &#8212; that matters.  (Applause.)<br> <br>If we&#8217;re going to pass, now that the Court came down with this decision in terms of the EPA &#8212; if we&#8217;re going to get meaningful legislation passed on greenhouse gas emissions and what we know is an absolute crisis in the world.  Elections matter.<br> <br>State elections matter.  Who is governor, who is lieutenant governor, who is attorney general, who is secretary of state &#8212; that matters.<br> <br>Local elections matter.  In these states that are talking about criminalizing women and their care providers, who is DA matters; who is sheriff matters; who is mayor who appoints the police chief matters.<br> <br>So we got a lot of work to do.<br> <br>But I want to stress that in the midst of these crises, we really do have to remember that we are up for this fight.  Because the alternative is not an option.  It is truly not an option to be overwhelmed. <br> <br>We have to be unified and stand together, understanding what we stand for as Democrats.  Because I do believe, when you know what you stand for, you know what to fight for.  (Applause.)  Yes.<br> <br>So we stand &#8212; we stand for equality.  We stand for unity.  We stand for freedom.  We stand for extending the Child Tax Credit, which, in its first year, brought child poverty down by at least 40 percent in our country.  (Applause.) <br> <br>We stand for a childcare tax cut that we got passed in the ARP, the American Rescue Plan, which is an $8,000 tax cut to help families pay for school supplies and medication for their children.  We stand for that.  (Applause.)<br> <br>We stand for building up infrastructure, which is why we got the first, in generations, Bipartisan Infrastructure Law passed.  Do you know what that does?  I&#8217;ve been traveling around the country in places like Michigan &#8212; I mean, all over the country &#8212; dealing with the fact that, in particular, in poor communities and communities of color, our babies, our children are drinking water out of lead pipes.  We got that bill passed.  We&#8217;re putting billions of dollars to eradicate and get lead out of pipes within 10 years.  (Applause.)<br> <br>Elections matter.<br> <br>We got extreme amount of funding put in on the issue of high-speed Internet.  Well, why is that important?  The pandemic highlighted the fact that we have vast disparities in this country based on the access to meaningful education for the children of America.  And among the inflection points on that issue, one of them is access to high-speed Internet and affordability of high-speed Internet.  So we have done that now, where we will be able to ensure that all families have access and affordable high-speed Internet, in particular for their children. <br> <br>These are some of the things that we have accomplished.  And there is more.<br> <br>Did y&#8217;all see somebody get sworn in today?  (Applause.) (Laughs.)  Her name is Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson! (Applause.) <br> <br>Elections matter. <br> <br>I&#8217;ve been traveling around the globe.  I met with President Zelenskyy two days before Russia, in an unprovoked hostile act, invaded Ukraine.  I have spent time with President Macron.  I have hosted Angela Merkel while she was chancellor, and sat down to meet with Chancellor Scholz.<br> <br>I just recently convened, at the Summit of the Americas, the prime ministers and presidents of the Caribbean nations.<br> <br>We have raised $1.2 billion to focus on the northern Central American countries of Honduras and Guatemala and El Salvador, investing, in particular, in women in those countries to address the needs that they have there so people don&#8217;t feel they have to flee their home.<br> <br>Elections matter.<br> <br>Because if President Joe Biden weren&#8217;t there, I promise you &#8212; because I have witnessed it &#8212; I do not believe NATO would have come together as it did, that we would have been able to convene the EU, as we did, to make a statement about a collective priority around international norms and rules that must be maintained, including the international rule and norm of sovereignty and territorial integrity that no nation can use violence to change the borders and invade another country.<br> <br>Elections matter.  (Applause.)<br> <br>And there is more work to do.  We&#8217;re still fighting to get affordable childcare.  We have been proposing working families shouldn&#8217;t spend more than 7 percent of their income in childcare.<br> <br>We saw how many millions of women during the pandemic had to leave the workforce.  Direct connection between availability and affordability of childcare and women in the workforce. <br> <br>We still have work to do.  We need paid family leave.  (Applause.) <br> <br>We need paid and affordable homecare.  So many, in particular women, but individuals who are in what we call the sandwich generation, raising their children and taking care of their elderly parents and trying to pay the bills.<br> <br>We still have work to do.  We need to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to Vote Act.  (Applause.) <br> <br>We have work to do.<br> <br>I was one of the authors of the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act.<br> <br>We have more work to do.  (Applause.)<br> <br>And then, by my count, if I&#8217;m correct, Jaime &#8212; 131 days<br>we will have a midterm election.  And on every level we have just discussed, the outcomes may be determined.<br> <br>Now, I know some people are saying, “Stop talking to us about the elections.  We know.”  Don&#8217;t trivialize the significance of it.  We can&#8217;t afford to.  We cannot afford to.  We got a lot we need to get done.  There is no question.  That is not the only thing, and it is not the elixir.<br> <br>But I am, as the Vice President of the United States, the President of the Senate.  And I will tell you, I run back and forth from my office in the West Wing to the Capitol to break tie votes.  Why?  Because we have a 50-50 Senate &#8212; 50 Republicans and then fif- &#8212; well, 48 Democr- &#8212; she thought I was going to say something else.  (Laughter.)  No, two in- &#8212; two independents who caucus with the Democrats.  (Laughter.)  Forty-eight plus two.   (Laughter.)  And we &#8212; we believe we can actually change those numbers in this election.  (Applause.)<br> <br>A hundred and thirty-one days, we&#8217;re looking at the House.  We have to, at the very least, hold on to the numbers there.<br> <br>But I was also &#8212; Jaime, I was looking at &#8212; and you&#8217;ll correct me &#8212; but I just did a quick review and jogged my memory about even just &#8212; you remember the 2010 midterms?  And we all remember that.  By my count, there were, I think &#8212; what was it? &#8212; something like 60 seats that were in a toss-up.  And this time, I think we have about 20.  Something like that.  It&#8217;s a much smaller number. <br> <br>So one could argue, I think fairly, it&#8217;s very doable.<br>It&#8217;s very doable.  Because all the resources have to go into fewer races.<br> <br>And, you know, I was &#8212; I was talking again, before we came in, about this dynamic.  So, you know, the question then becomes how are we going to win.  Right?  And I think part of it is to make clear, again, what we stand for as Democrats and, therefore, what we fight for. <br> <br>But also, just check this out for a moment: The American Rescue Plan &#8212; okay? &#8212; height of the pandemic.  We come in as an administration.  People are out of work.  Small businesses are folding.  Right?  The childcare piece &#8212; the Child Tax Credit, child poverty &#8212; that bill, which the President eventually was able to get through, you understand that not one Republican voted for it.  Not one.  Child Tax Credit &#8212; tax cut &#8212; $8,000 tax cut &#8212; child tax cut for childcare expenses.<br> <br>The &#8212; I sat there.  I presided.  It was very important to me to, again, leave the White House and go to the Senate, even though, you know, we knew it was probably not going to work out, to preside over the vote on the Women &#8212; Women&#8217;s Health Act.  Not one Republican voted for it. <br> <br>You can go down the list and see that they don&#8217;t only obstruct and not support what is helpful.  They actually don&#8217;t have a plan.  And, you know, while we talk about the things we need to do more, we also have to see what we&#8217;re up against.<br> <br>There &#8212; there&#8217;s no bipartisanship, except for the infrastructure, that&#8217;s happening on things that should be non-debatable.<br> <br>I asked my team to do a Venn diagram and &#8212; and show me the states where we&#8217;re seeing legislation come out that is anti-choice, anti-LGBTQ, anti-voting rights.  It&#8217;s an interesting diagram.  (Laughter.)  It tells you a whole lot.<br> <br>The intersection on voting rights and abortion &#8212; I think there were at least 11 states clearly.  Right?  So they say, “We&#8217;re going to send it to the states, and then the states and then the people in the states can vote for what they want.  Oh, but meanwhile, we&#8217;re making it more difficult for you to vote.”<br>Right?<br> <br>They talk about liberty and freedom &#8212; freedom of choice, freedom to marry, freedom to make a decision about contraception.<br> <br>So there are clear choices in this election coming up &#8212; very clear choices.  We have to stay active.  We have to demand the most and the best from ourselves.  And we have to see the power that we have right now, at the very least over the next 131 days, to change the outcome of this election in a way that can have impact. <br> <br>I know every year, every election we say this is the biggest one.  But, man, I mean, this Court just took a constitutional right from the women of America. <br> <br>So with that, I say: Let&#8217;s fight.  We know what we have to do.  Let&#8217;s stand together.  We are of common purpose.  We know what we stand for, and we know what we&#8217;re fighting for.  Because, ultimately, we&#8217;re not fighting against anything, we&#8217;re fighting for something.<br> <br>And truly, if you were to pull out on a macro level, we are fighting for the democracy of America.  (Applause.)<br> <br>So with that, I thank you all very much.  Thank you.  (Applause.)<br> <br>                               END                 4:14 P.M. PDT<br><br></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>Today, the World Bank Board voted to approve the establishment of a new Financial Intermediary Fund that will make the world safer and more secure from pandemics.&nbsp; Since Day One of my Administration, I have called for a mechanism to catalyze global progress to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease threats.&nbsp; The United States is doing its part to collectively and collaboratively build global consensus towards establishing this new fund through calls to action and partnership from leaders across our government.&nbsp; Strong and relentless leadership from our allies and partners, including through the Indonesia G20 Presidency in 2022 and the Italy G20 Presidency in 2021, has brought us to this significant milestone.</p>



<p>Infectious diseases that cross borders, cause death, and disrupt societies and economies are a threat to national and global security. Over one million Americans and millions more around the world have died from COVID-19. Economies and societies have been devastated in its wake, and studies suggest the risk of another pandemic is significant. When it comes to preparing for the next pandemic, the cost of inaction is greater than the cost of action.&nbsp; Investing in preparedness now is the right thing and the smart thing to do.</p>



<p>The generosity of the American people and Congress enabled my initial U.S. pledge of $450 million to support the fund from the outset, and it has galvanized other partners to step up immediately: commitments totaling nearly $1.1 billion have been made by the United States, the European Commission, Germany, Indonesia, the United Kingdom, Singapore, and a philanthropic foundation; we are optimistic others will soon join us.</p>



<p>To protect lives at home and all over the world, we must increase investments in pandemic preparedness. This requires sustained investment that goes beyond traditional global health and development programming, to ensure we address health security risks in addition to, and not in place of, existing global health challenges. Experts estimate that more than $10 billion annually is needed to fill international financing gaps for health security and pandemic preparedness. To begin filling those gaps, this new fund will complement existing global health programs – it is an investment in our global and national security that will yield significant economic and health dividends for years to come. As requested in my Fiscal Year 2023 Budget, I call on Congress to provide an additional $4.75 billion in mandatory and discretionary funds, which will greatly enhance the fund’s effectiveness and catalyze commitments from others. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let me be clear: protecting the United States from infectious disease threats cannot be accomplished with incremental increases in annual global health spending alone.&nbsp; Additional financing is needed to make new progress against infectious diseases we will face, on top of continued demands for the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic, and sustained support for longstanding global health investments and health systems, including the Seventh Replenishment of the Global Fund, which I look forward to hosting this September.<br><br></p>



<p>Today’s World Bank Board vote is a significant milestone, and the United States looks forward to doing its part to strengthen the global health security architecture.</p>

<p>The Republican Senate leader is holding hostage a bipartisan package to strengthen American competitiveness versus China, that would yield hundreds of thousands of manufacturing jobs in places like Southern Ohio, Idaho, and other states around the country.  It would lower the cost of countless products, and end our reliance on imports.  Why? To protect the ability of big pharmaceutical companies to price gouge. Senate Republicans are literally choosing to help China out compete the U.S. in order to protect big drug companies. This takes loyalty to special interests over working Americans to a new and shocking height.  We are not going to back down in the face of this outrageous threat.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>I am honored that the very first judicial nominee I selected as President – the brilliant lawyer who became “Judge Jackson” – has now become “Justice Jackson.”&nbsp;<br><br>Her historic swearing in today represents a profound step forward for our nation, for all the young, Black girls who now see themselves reflected on our highest court, and for all of us as Americans.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The Supreme Court just gained a colleague with a world-class intellect, the dignified temperament the American people expect of a justice, and the strongest credentials imaginable. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Justice Jackson is a former public defender who served for almost a decade as a district and circuit judge. &nbsp;Her nomination was endorsed by top legal experts across the political spectrum, as well as our country’s leading law enforcement organizations.&nbsp; In her career, she has been confirmed four times by the U.S. Senate with bipartisan support.<br>&nbsp;<br>She is the daughter of educators and the niece of a police chief—and she too has devoted her life to public service.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>She is also the embodiment of hard work, grace, and perseverance.<br>&nbsp;<br>Justice Jackson’s wisdom and experience, will make all of us proud for so many years to come.<br>&nbsp;<br>Like I said after her confirmation, Justice Jackson’s ascension to the highest court in the land makes the sun shine on so many of us in a new way.<br>&nbsp;<br>Justice Jackson succeeds another extraordinarily brilliant jurist who has also devoted their life to their country, including in the U.S. Army as a teenager and on the Watergate Committee &nbsp;&#8211; Justice Steven Breyer. Justice Breyer’s integrity and his commitment to ensuring our nation’s laws worked for the people have made him beloved by his colleagues and deeply respected across our country. I thank him again for his many years of exemplary service. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Biden Administration will facilitate air shipment of approximately 849,000 8-ounce bottle equivalents of&nbsp;Nestl</em>é® <em>NAN® </em>EXPERTpro<em> SensiPro infant formula this weekend</em></p>



<p>Today, President Biden is announcing that his Administration is sourcing a flight, facilitated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), for Operation Fly Formula to transport Nestlé infant formula from Australia to Fort Worth, Texas on July 4. This delivery will include over 56,000 pounds of <a>Nestlé </a>NAN SensiPro formula, the equivalent of approximately 849,000 8-ounce bottles. The product will be available through Gerber.com.</p>



<p>In May, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced that the agency is exercising enforcement discretion so that Nestlé can export additional infant formula into the U.S.&nbsp;Nestlé will import both standard and specialty infant formulas including&nbsp;<a>Nestlé&nbsp;NAN</a> SupremePro 1, Nestlé NAN SupremePro 2, Nestlé&nbsp;NAN EXPERTpro SensiPro Premium Instant Starter Formula, Nestlé Health Science Alfamino/Alfamino, Jr., Gerber® Good Start® Gentle and Gerber® Good Start® Extensive HA®. Over time Nestlé plans to bring approximately 42 million 8-ounce bottle equivalents into the U.S. market.</p>



<p>President Biden launched Operation Fly Formula to speed up the import of infant formula and start getting more formula to stores as soon as possible. Under Operation Fly Formula, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the General Services Administration (GSA), and the Department of Defense (DOD) are partnering to pick up overseas infant formula that meets U.S. health and safety standards, so it can get to store shelves faster. <em>By July 3, Operation Fly Formula will have transported more than 37.2 million 8-ounce bottle equivalents to the U.S.</em></p>



<p>In addition, the Biden Administration has taken a number of other important actions to ensure there is enough safe infant formula for families, including invoking the Defense Production Act, entering into a consent agreement between the FDA and Abbott Nutrition to reopen the company’s Sturgis facility, and issuing FDA guidance so that major formula manufacturers can safely import formula that is not currently being produced for the U.S. market. Details of our actions can be found at whitehouse.gov/formula.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>July 1<sup>st</sup> marks the 25<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the of the handover of Hong Kong to the People’s Republic of China (PRC). This date was originally envisioned as the halfway point of 50 years of promised autonomy under the Sino-British Joint Declaration. Instead of looking forward to another 25 years of autonomy for Hong Kong, we have witnessed the dismantling of Hong Kong’s democratic institutions and the unprecedented pressures on the judiciary, the stifling of academic, cultural, and press freedoms, and the coerced disbandment of dozens of civil society groups and news outlets. These actions undermine fundamental freedoms and the rules-based order which serves to preserve global stability.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today is the second anniversary of National Security Law, the aggressive implementation of which has eliminated any meaningful political opposition in Hong Kong and stifled dissent. As a result, today almost all of Hong Kong&#8217;s pro-democracy politicians are either in prison pending trial or in exile overseas. NGOs, trade unions and human rights organizations opposing the Government&#8217;s agenda have been forced to disband or leave, for fear of government reprisals. The PRC’s policies toward Hong Kong also have shaken the institutions, rules, and systems that had been the basis of international confidence in Hong Kong – which was the bedrock of its role as an economic hub.</p>



<p>We call on the PRC to act in accordance with the international obligations it willingly undertook. Ahead of the Chief Executive&#8217;s inauguration, we reiterate the importance that Hong Kong&#8217;s leadership respects the protected rights and freedoms of people in Hong Kong, as provided for in the Basic Law. </p>

<p>The Supreme Court’s ruling in <em>West Virginia vs. EPA </em>is another devastating decision that aims to take our country backwards. While this decision risks damaging our nation’s ability to keep our air clean and combat climate change, I will not relent in using my lawful authorities to protect public health and tackle the climate crisis.</p>



<p>I have directed my legal team to work with the Department of Justice and affected agencies to review this decision carefully and find ways that we can, under federal law, continue protecting Americans from harmful pollution, including pollution that causes climate change.</p>



<p>Since the Clean Air Act was passed by a bipartisan majority in Congress in 1970, the landmark law has enabled both Democratic and Republican administrations to protect and improve the air we breathe, cutting air pollution by 78 percent even as our economy quadrupled in size. Yet today’s decision sides with special interests that have waged a long-term campaign to strip away our right to breathe clean air.</p>



<p>We cannot and will not ignore the danger to public health and existential threat the climate crisis poses. The science confirms what we all see with our own eyes – the wildfires, droughts, extreme heat, and intense storms are endangering our lives and livelihoods.</p>



<p>I will take action. My Administration will continue using lawful executive authority, including the EPA’s legally-upheld authorities, to keep our air clean, protect public health, and tackle the climate crisis. We will work with states and cities to pass and uphold laws that protect their citizens. And we will keep pushing for additional Congressional action, so that Americans can fully seize the economic opportunities, cost-saving benefits, and security of a clean energy future. Together, we will tackle environmental injustice, create good-paying jobs, and lower costs for families building the clean energy economy.</p>



<p>Our fight against climate change must carry forward, and it will. </p>
