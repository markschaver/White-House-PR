<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>New U.S. Commitment on Destructive Direct-Ascent Anti-Satellite Missile Testing</em></p>



<p>Today at Vandenberg Space Force Base in California,&nbsp;Vice President Kamala Harris announced&nbsp;that&nbsp;the United States&nbsp;commits not to conduct&nbsp;destructive, direct-ascent anti-satellite (ASAT) missile testing, and that the United States seeks to establish this as a new international norm for responsible behavior&nbsp;in space.&nbsp;The Vice President also called on other nations to make similar commitments and to work together in establishing this as a norm, making the case that such efforts benefit&nbsp;all nations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the&nbsp;Biden-Harris&nbsp;Administration’s first National Space Council&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/12/01/remarks-by-vice-president-harris-before-the-administrations-inaugural-national-space-council-meeting/">meeting</a>&nbsp;in December, Vice President Harris tasked the National Security Council&nbsp;staff&nbsp;to work with&nbsp;the Department of Defense,&nbsp;the Department of State, and other national security agencies to develop proposals for national security space normsthat advance U.S. interests and preserve the security and sustainability of space.&nbsp;The commitment announced today is the first initiative under this effort.&nbsp;The United States is the first nation to make such a declaration.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This&nbsp;commitment&nbsp;addresses&nbsp;one of the most pressing threats to the security and sustainability of space, as demonstrated by Russia&#8217;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.state.gov/russia-conducts-destructive-anti-satellite-missile-test/">November 2021</a>&nbsp;destructive&nbsp;direct ­ascent&nbsp;ASAT missile test.&nbsp;The People’s Republic of China conducted a similar test in 2007.&nbsp;The destruction of space objects through direct-ascent&nbsp;ASAT&nbsp;missile testing is reckless and irresponsible. The long-lived debris created by these tests now threaten satellites and other space objects that are vital to all nations’&nbsp;security, economic, and scientific interests, and increases risk to astronauts&nbsp;in space. Overall, these tests&nbsp;jeopardize the long-term sustainability of outer space and imperil the exploration and use of space by all nations.</p>



<p>Developing&nbsp;a shared understanding&nbsp;of&nbsp;what constitutes safe and responsible space activities contributes to a more stable space environment by reducing the risk of miscommunication and miscalculation.&nbsp;This is especially important as there&nbsp;is an ever-increasing number of states and non-governmental entities&nbsp;that&nbsp;rely on space services and space assets which are vulnerable to debris.</p>



<p>This new commitment also protects U.S. interests in space. Meaningfully reducing ASAT testing and debris generation advances U.S. national security interests and protects long-term U.S. interests in space exploration, space science, and space-enabled economic development.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Conflict or confrontation in outer space is not inevitable, and the United States seeks to ensure outer space remains free from conflict. &nbsp;The Biden-Harris&nbsp;Administration&nbsp;had made clear&nbsp;that the United States will engage the international community to uphold and strengthen a rules-based international order for space. The United States, working with commercial industry, allies, and partners, will lead in the development of new measures that contribute to the safety, stability, security, and long-term sustainability of space activities. &nbsp;Overall,&nbsp;through this new commitment and other actions,&nbsp;the&nbsp;United States will demonstrate how space activities can be conducted in a responsible, peaceful, and sustainable manner.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>This Tax Day, the difference in approach between the President and Congressional Republicans couldn’t be clearer.&nbsp; The President is fighting for tax cuts for the middle class and to ensure that the super wealthy and large corporations pay their fair share, while Congressional Republicans, led by Senator Scott, are proposing big tax increases on middle-class families.</p>



<p>President Biden’s plan would give tax relief to tens of millions of families—continuing the tax relief families are seeing this Tax Day—and he’d apply new minimum taxes on billionaires and large corporations to make sure they’re paying their fair share.&nbsp; He wouldn’t raise taxes by a penny on anyone making less than $400,000.</p>



<p>In contrast, Congressional Republicans would continue the big handouts they’ve given to the richest Americans and largest corporations and implement a Middle-Class Tax Increase. Congressional Republicans’ plan will increase middle-class families’ taxes an average of nearly <a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/model-estimates/minimum-federal-individual-income-tax-february-2022/t22-0002-enact-minimum-federal">$1,500</a> this year alone and take $100 billion out of the hands of middle-class families each year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Not only that – but the Republican plan would eliminate Social Security and Medicare. The President believes we have a sacred commitment to our nation’s seniors, while the Republican plan puts that at risk.</p>



<p><strong>The President’s Tax Plan Ensures That Corporations and Billionaires Pay Their Fair Share and Delivers Tax Relief to Middle-Class Families</strong></p>



<p>In recent years, both billionaires and the largest corporations have paid an average tax rate of just 8 percent.&nbsp; That’s less than what a teacher and firefighter can pay.&nbsp; The President’s plan would fix that, and give middle-class families the tax relief they deserve.</p>



<p>President Biden is calling on Congress to pass legislation requiring the wealthiest American households to pay a minimum of 20 percent on all of their income, including unrealized investment income that currently is untaxed.&nbsp; The richest Americans could no longer do what they can now—and often pay no tax whatsoever or very little tax on their income and too often escape paying income tax forever. The tax will apply only to the top one-one hundredth of one percent (0.01%) of American households &#8212; those worth over $100 million, and over half of hundreds of billions raised would come from households worth more than $1 billion.</p>



<p>The President has also proposed repealing the 2017 Republican tax giveaways for the wealthiest Americans by restoring the top income tax rate for those making more than $400,000.</p>



<p>The President believes that profitable corporations shouldn’t pay a lower tax bill than a middle-class family, and shouldn’t be able to avoid taxes by shipping jobs and profits overseas. The President is championing a 15 percent corporate minimum tax here and around the world to ensure that no large profitable corporation gets away with paying $0 in taxes and reversing the massive 2017 Republican tax cuts, by increasing the corporate tax rate to 28 percent.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, the President is fighting for continued middle-class tax relief, especially as the middle class and working people deal with global inflation.&nbsp; Because of the American Rescue Plan, millions of middle-class families are receiving well deserved tax cuts through the Child Tax Credit, the Earned Income Tax Credit, Affordable Care Act Premium Tax Credits, and the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit.&nbsp; Families are benefitting from these tax cuts right now as they file their taxes on this Tax Day.&nbsp; The President is proposing extending that tax relief because he believes that middle-class families already pay enough in taxes.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Republican Middle-Class Tax Increase and Threat to Social Security and Medicare</strong></p>



<p>After delivering almost $2 trillion in tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans and largest corporations with their 2017 tax law, Congressional Republicans, led by Senator Rick Scott, are following up by proposing $100 billion per year in tax <em>increases</em> on middle-class families. &nbsp;According to independent analysis, around 75 million American families—96 percent of them making less than $100,000—would pay an average of <a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/model-estimates/minimum-federal-individual-income-tax-february-2022/t22-0002-enact-minimum-federal">$1,480 more in taxes each year</a>.&nbsp; The Republican plan doesn’t raise a single penny in taxes from the wealthiest Americans or profitable corporations.</p>



<p>These tax increases would mean:</p>



<ul><li>24 million families of seniors making less than $100,000 per year would face tax increases.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul><li>Another 24 million families with kids making less than $100,000 per year would face tax increases.</li></ul>



<p>In 2017 the Republicans delivered an average tax cut of over <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-tax/new-tax-law-is-fundamentally-flawed-and-will-require-basic-restructuring?msclkid=fa754cd4bb3a11ec90b7bafcd074bdb7">$250,000</a> a year to families in the top .1%; now they want working families to pay $100 billion <em>more</em> in taxes each year. &nbsp;Republicans complain that middle-class Americans don’t have “skin in the game” and don’t pay enough in taxes.&nbsp; But the truth is that middle-class Americans are the back bone of our economy, pay plenty in federal, state, and local taxes, and in many cases pay a higher rate than the super-wealthy. &nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s not just that – the Republican plan calls for expiring all laws, including Social Security and Medicare, after 5 years.&nbsp; That means Social Security and Medicare would be eliminated, unless Congress could enact them again.&nbsp; That’s wrong.&nbsp; The President believes these programs are sacred commitments.&nbsp; They should be strengthened – not threatened.</p>



<p><strong>The Choice Is Clear</strong> This Tax Day, it’s a clear choice.&nbsp; And the President is going to continue fighting for middle-class tax relief and to make sure the richest Americans and largest corporations don’t pay a lower rate than middle-class families.&nbsp; And he will fight against the Republican plan to raise taxes on middle-class families and to threaten the future of Social Security and Medicare, while continuing giant hand outs to very top and the largest corporations.</p>

<p>The United States as first COVID Summit Chair, Belize, as CARICOM Chair; Germany, holding the G7 Presidency; Indonesia, holding the G20 Presidency; and Senegal as African Union Chair, are pleased to announce we will co-host the second Global COVID-19 Summit, which will be held virtually on May 12, 2022.&nbsp;The Summit will redouble our collective efforts to end the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic and prepare for future health threats.<br>&nbsp;<br>This Summit follows the first <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/09/24/global-covid-19-summit-ending-the-pandemic-and-building-back-better/">Global COVID-19 Summit</a> convened by the United States on September 22, 2021.&nbsp;In advance of the May 12 Summit, we are calling on world leaders, members of civil society, non-governmental organizations, philanthropists, and the private sector to make new commitments and bring solutions to <a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1441202427609305097">vaccinate the world, save lives now, and build better health security</a> &#8212; for everyone, everywhere.<br>&nbsp;<br>The emergence and spread of new variants, like Omicron, have reinforced the need for a strategy aimed at controlling COVID-19 worldwide. Together, we can mitigate the impact of COVID-19 and protect those at the highest risk with vaccinations, testing, and treatments, actions to minimize disruption to routine health services, and through support for the ACT-Accelerator multilateral mechanism.&nbsp;We know we must prepare now to build, sustain, and finance the global capacity we need, not only for emerging COVID-19 variants, but also future health crises.&nbsp;To help achieve these goals, we urge all countries and stakeholders to pledge to take urgent actions to create the systems we need to end the acute phase of COVID-19, save lives, and build better health security and health systems.<br>&nbsp;<br>The Summit will build on the themes and commitments made at the first Summit and will place an emphasis on supporting locally-led solutions to both immediate and long-term challenges, including:</p>



<ul><li>Getting shots into arms;</li><li>Deploying tests and treatments, especially for the highest-risk populations;</li><li>Expanding and protecting the health workforce and minimizing disruptions to routine and essential health services;</li><li>Enhancing access to medical countermeasures, including research and development and scaling and diversifying local and regional manufacturing; and</li><li>Generating sustainable financing for pandemic preparedness, health security, and health systems&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>We look forward to another successful Summit to continue the international effort in the fight against COVID-19 and to advance global pandemic preparedness.</p>

<p>This week, National Security Council Indo-Pacific Coordinator Kurt Campbell and Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Daniel Kritenbrink will lead a delegation of U.S. government officials to three Pacific Island nations: Fiji, Papua New Guinea, and the Solomon Islands. The delegation—which will include representatives from the National Security Council, the Department of State, the Department of Defense, and the United States Agency for International Development—will seek to further deepen our enduring ties with the region and to advance a free, open, and resilient Indo-Pacific. In Hawaii, the delegation will consult with senior military officials and regional partners at United States Indo-Pacific Command. In Fiji, Papua New Guinea, and the Solomon Islands, the delegation will meet with senior government officials to ensure our partnerships deliver prosperity, security, and peace across the Pacific Islands and the Indo-Pacific. They will also meet with representatives of the Pacific Islands Forum, a critical driver of regional action, to discuss issues of importance to the Pacific as a whole. The trip builds on Secretary Antony Blinken’s travel in February to the region, during which the Administration released the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/U.S.-Indo-Pacific-Strategy.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Indo-Pacific Strategy of the United States</a> and furthered our shared commitment to democracy and prosperity in the Pacific.</p>

<p>Jill and I join fellow Christians around the world in celebrating Easter Sunday — a day of joy and hope, of renewal and rebirth.</p>



<p>Once again, Holy Week has taken us on a journey from sorrow to salvation. As we reflect today on Christ’s Resurrection, we are reminded that with faith, hope, and love — even death can be defeated.</p>



<p>And, as we emerge from this pandemic, we are grateful that so many are able to celebrate this day of joy and renewal with services and family gatherings in person and together again. But we know this Holy Day falls on heavy hearts for those who have lost loved ones and those among us living in the dark shadow of war, persecution, and poverty.</p>



<p>On this day and each day, we pray for them, and for peace, freedom, and the basic dignity and respect for all of God’s children. As we look ahead with His blessing, may we share a common hope for the future, reaffirm love and compassion for one another, and cherish the blessing of the dawn of new possibilities.</p>



<p>From our family to yours, we wish you hope, health, joy, and the peace of God, which passes all understanding.</p>



<p>Happy Easter and may God bless and keep you.</p>

<p>President Biden will host the Leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in Washington, DC&nbsp;on May 12&nbsp;and 13 for a U.S.-ASEAN Special Summit.</p>



<p>The Special Summit will demonstrate the United States’ enduring commitment to ASEAN, recognizing its central role in delivering sustainable solutions to the region’s most pressing challenges, and commemorate 45 years of U.S.-ASEAN relations. It will build on President Biden’s participation in the October 2021 U.S.-ASEAN Summit, where the President announced $102 million in new initiatives to expand our engagement with ASEAN on COVID-19 recovery and health security, fighting the climate crisis, stimulating broad-based economic growth, promoting gender equality, and deepening people-to-people ties.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is a top priority for the Biden-Harris Administration to serve as a strong, reliable partner in Southeast Asia. Our shared aspirations for the region will continue to underpin our common commitment to advance an Indo-Pacific that is free and open, secure, connected, and resilient.</p>
