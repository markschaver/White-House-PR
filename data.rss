<p class="has-text-align-center">Veterans Memorial Park<br>New Castle, Delaware</p>



<p>10:53 A.M. EDT</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Thank you very much.&nbsp; Good morning, everyone.&nbsp; It&#8217;s good to be here on this solemn occasion with so many friends &#8212; Governor Carney, Senator Carper, Attorney Keneral- [sic] &#8212; General Kathy Jennings.&nbsp; General Berry, it’s good to see you.&nbsp; And thank you for everything you do for the Delaware National Guard.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By the way, I saw General Vavala this morning.&nbsp; He&#8217;s become not only a general, but a great friend.&nbsp; A great friend.&nbsp; He was at Beau’s memorial mass this morning.&nbsp; Thank you for being there, General.&nbsp; I appreciate it.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>And, by the way, Hunter has had one shot &#8212; (laughter) &#8212; not two, and he&#8217;s just making sure everybody is okay.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Me and my family, we&#8217;ve tried to participate in this event every year because it&#8217;s an important tradition in the Delaware community.&nbsp; Even last year, in those early dark days of the pandemic, Jill and I didn&#8217;t want to let Memorial Day pass like every other day.&nbsp; And there was no event here, but we came to lay a wreath at the plaza.&nbsp; It was the first time we did any sort of event since the lockdown had begun in March because we were determined &#8212; determined &#8212; to honor the fallen, to pay tribute to the women and men who braved every danger, who made the ultimate sacrifice for their country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because as a nation, we must always remember &#8212; always remember.&nbsp; We must remember the price that was paid for our liberties.&nbsp; We must remember the debt we owe those who have paid it, and the families left behind.&nbsp; My heart is torn in half by the grief.&nbsp; The communities were never whole again.</p>



<p>Folks, it&#8217;s also an important tradition in our family.&nbsp; As many of you know, this is a hard day for us.&nbsp; Six years ago today, Hunter lost his dad and I lost my son.&nbsp; It’s &#8212; the first year after his passing back in 2016, General Vavala did a great honor in inviting us to a ceremony renaming the Delaware National Guard headquarters in Beau’s honor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By the way, I’d note that when Beau made the grade of major in &#8212; in Iraq, I said &#8212; I had been in and out of Iraq over 25 times.&nbsp; I said, “Beau, you&#8217;re now a field-grade officer.”&nbsp; He said, “Dad, I have no illusion who runs the United States Army.&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s the master sergeants.” (Laughter.)&nbsp; “They run the army.”</p>



<p>Well, I woke up that morning hearing Beau in my ear saying, “Not me, Dad.&nbsp; Today is not about me.&nbsp; It&#8217;s Memorial Day.&nbsp; You should be over at the bridge.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, you know, if he were here, he would be here as well, paying his respects to all those &#8212; all those who gave so much for our country, and particularly honoring the Gold Star families.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You know, a lot of time passes, but you all know better than I do &#8212; or as well as I do &#8212; that the moment that we celebrate it is the toughest day of the year.&nbsp; We&#8217;re honored, but it&#8217;s a tough day.&nbsp; It brings back everything.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so I can&#8217;t thank you enough for your continued service to the country.&nbsp; And your &#8212; your sons, your daughters, they live on in your hearts and in their children as well.&nbsp; And we have to carry on without them.&nbsp; But I know how hard it is for you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Beau didn’t die in the line of duty, but he was serving a Delaware National Guard unit in Iraq for a year.&nbsp; That was one of the proudest things he did in his life.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, thank you for allowing us to grieve together today.&nbsp; I know how much the loss hurts.&nbsp; I know the black hole that it leaves in the middle of your chest, that feels like you may get sucked into it and not come out.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Greetings like this and gatherings help.&nbsp; And while I know nothing I can say to ease the pain, I just know that each year it gets a little bit &#8212; a little bit easier.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I promise you the day will come when the mention of the name of your son or daughter, husband, wife &#8212; they will, in fact, bring not a tear to your eye, but a smile to your lips.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Folks &#8212; and I hope that day comes sooner than later.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Folks, you know, despite all the pain, I know the pride you feel in the loved one and &#8212; that you lost and those who are still serving, the pride and the bravery in the service to our great American experiment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our military community is the solid spine of this country.&nbsp; It’s literally the spine of the nation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And on my first Memorial Day as Commander-in-Chief, I want to reaffirm my longstanding belief: We may have many obligations as a nation, but we only have one truly sacred obligation, and that&#8217;s to equip those we send into harm&#8217;s way with all they need, and care for them and their families when they re-ho- &#8212; when they return home, and when they don&#8217;t.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And all of us who remain have a duty to renew our commitment to the fundamental values to our nation in their honor &#8212; the values that have inspired generation after generation to service and that so many have died to defend.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Every day since I was Vice President, I&#8217;ve carried with me a card with the exact number of troops killed in our operations in Afghanistan and Iraq &#8212; not an approximation or a rounded number; an accounting of every life laid down for our country over the 20 years of war.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, it&#8217;s 7,036 military members &#8212; fallen angels &#8212; have given the “last full measure of devotion,” as Lincoln termed it, in those modern conflicts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And we will never forget.&nbsp; They&#8217;re the guardians and we’re the guardians.&nbsp; They&#8217;re the guardians of us, and we&#8217;re the guardians of their legacy, inheritors of their mission, and the living testament to their sacrifice that is not going to be in vain.&nbsp; Because every American democracy endures.&nbsp; We have been tested, and we still will be surely tested further.&nbsp; But I know that we as a people are up to the task.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Each generation of Americans receives the precious gift of liberty.&nbsp;&nbsp;And we work to share it with more people; to make our country more open, more free, more fair; to bring us closer &#8212; closer to making our American creed a reality for all Americans: that all women and men are created equal; that all women and men equally deserve to be treated with dignity; that all men and women deserve equal rights, equal protection to build up futures for their families, and hope and opportunity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The American creed is the connective tissue that binds us.&nbsp; It’s a long chain of patriots that come before us and those who will follow us in turn.&nbsp; That creed holds that the ideals that inspire people to service and that us &#8212; fill us with pride when we see our loved ones put on that uniform.&nbsp; And our progress toward that creed together, as one nation united and preserved through their sacrifices, is the best and strongest memorial to their lives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ladies and gentlemen, America is unique.&nbsp; It&#8217;s an idea.&nbsp; Unlike any other country in the world, it is formed based on an idea.&nbsp; Almost every other country is based on a creed, a religion, a geography, an ethnicity, but not us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’re based on an idea: that we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men and women are created equal.&nbsp; We&#8217;re unique in the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I had a long conversation &#8212; for two hours &#8212; recently with President Xi, making it clear to him that we could do nothing but speak out for human rights around the world because that&#8217;s who we are.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I&#8217;ll be meeting with President Putin in a couple of weeks in Geneva, making it clear that we will not &#8212; we will not stand by and let him abuse those rights.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Folks, we’re unique in all of history.&nbsp; We really are.&nbsp; But those names that&#8217;s on that wall, and every other wall and tombstone in America of veterans, is the reason why we&#8217;re able to stand here.&nbsp; We can&#8217;t kid ourselves about that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so I hope &#8212; I hope that the nation comes together.&nbsp; We&#8217;re not Democrats or Republicans today.&nbsp; We&#8217;re Americans.&nbsp; We&#8217;re Americans &#8212; (applause) &#8212; who have given their lives.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s time we remind everybody who we are.</p>



<p>Thank you all for being here.&nbsp; May God bless you all, particularly the Gold Star families and survivors.&nbsp; And may God protect our troops, because they&#8217;re still out there.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;</p>

<p>Today, Texas legislators put forth a bill that joins Georgia and Florida in advancing a state law that attacks the sacred right to vote. It’s part of an assault on democracy that we’ve seen far too often this year—and often disproportionately targeting Black and Brown Americans.</p>



<p>It’s wrong and un-American. In the 21<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;century, we should be making it easier,&nbsp;not harder,&nbsp;for every eligible voter to vote.</p>



<p>I call again on Congress to pass&nbsp;the For the People Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. And&nbsp;I&nbsp;continue to call&nbsp;on all Americans, of every party and persuasion, to stand up for&nbsp;our&nbsp;democracy and protect the right to vote and the integrity of our elections.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>Belarus’s forced diversion of a commercial Ryanair flight under false pretenses, traveling between two member states of the European Union, and the subsequent removal and arrest of Raman Pratasevich, a Belarusian journalist, are a direct affront to international norms.&nbsp;These events took place amid an escalating wave of repression by the Lukashenka regime against the aspirations of the people of Belarus for democracy and human rights.&nbsp;In response to the events of May 23 and the Lukashenka regime’s continuing attack on fundamental freedoms, the United States is taking the following actions:</p>



<ul><li>The United States has joined the public condemnation of the events of May 23 at the United Nations (UN), the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), the Group of Seven (G7), and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). We will continue to advocate at these bodies for action against the Lukashenka regime for its affront to international norms and undermining of democracy and human rights.</li></ul>



<ul><li>The Department of State has issued a Level 4 Do Not Travel warning to U.S. citizens urging them not to travel to Belarus. The Federal Aviation Administration has issued a Notice to Airmen warning U.S. passenger carriers to exercise extreme caution when considering flying in Belarusian airspace.</li></ul>



<ul><li>On June 3, 2021, the United States will re-impose full blocking sanctions against nine Belarusian state-owned enterprises previously granted relief under a series of General Licenses by the Treasury Department. As a result of this measure, U.S. persons will be prohibited from engaging in transactions with these entities, their property, or their interests in property.</li></ul>



<ul><li>The United States, in coordination with the EU and other partners and Allies, is developing a list of targeted sanctions against key members of the Lukashenka regime associated with ongoing abuses of human rights and corruption, the falsification of the 2020 election, and the events of May 23.</li></ul>



<ul><li>The Treasury Department will develop for the President’s review a new Executive Order that will provide the United States increased authorities to impose sanctions on elements of the Lukashenka regime, its support network, and those that support corruption, the abuse of human rights, and attacks on democracy.</li></ul>



<ul><li>The Department of Justice, including the FBI, is working closely on this matter with our European counterparts.</li></ul>



<ul><li>The United States will suspend its discretionary application of the 2019 U.S-Belarus Air Services Agreement.</li></ul>



<p>We take these measures, together with our partners and Allies, to hold the regime accountable for its actions and to demonstrate our commitment to the aspirations of the people of Belarus. We call on Lukashenka to allow a credible international investigation into the events of May 23, immediately release all political prisoners, and enter into a comprehensive and genuine political dialogue with the leaders of the democratic opposition and civil society groups that leads to the conduct of free and fair Presidential elections under OSCE auspices and monitoring.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Joint Base Langley-Eustis<br>Hampton, Virginia</p>



<p>2:06 P.M. EDT<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; I&#8217;ll let you guys get comfortable.&nbsp; (Laughs.)<br><br>Colonel Ross &#8212; Clint, it&#8217;s wonderful to see you again.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; When our path last crossed, as Jill said, you were serving in the White House.&nbsp; And I never thought we&#8217;d be standing here today doing what we&#8217;re doing today.&nbsp;<br><br>And, Chief Master Sergeant Peterson, thank you, and to all members of your team who helped put this visit together today. It &#8212; it means a lot to Jill and me.&nbsp;<br><br>When I was Vice President and &#8212; as Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, we tried to visit almost every major military base in the country, and as Vice President, around the world.&nbsp; And you are &#8212; simply stated, you are the backbone of the country.&nbsp; You&#8217;re the backbone of the country.&nbsp;<br><br>And although our son Beau was the Attorney General of the state of Delaware and had spent nine months in Kosovo trying to &#8212; as assistant U.S. attorney &#8212; trying to set up their criminal justice system.&nbsp; And I might say, I&#8217;ve &#8212; I can do this with the military; I&#8217;m going to brag about him a little bit &#8212; he&#8217;s the only foreigner to have a war memorial erected to him in Kosovo, just below <s>Fort</s> [Camp] Bondsteel and a highway &#8212; the first highway they built &#8212; named after him: the Joseph R. &#8220;Beau&#8221; Biden Memorial Highway.&nbsp; And he was a &#8212; he was proud as hell &#8212; as hell of his work.&nbsp;<br><br>But then he decided that &#8212; I kept on &#8212; he had contracted a &#8212; exposure to a virus in &#8212; when he was in Kosovo and in Turkey as a civilian.&nbsp; And he came back with a problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>But he kept going to Walter Reed.&nbsp; I couldn&#8217;t understand why he was &#8212; they finally found &#8212; it&#8217;s called ankylosing spondylitis.&nbsp; They finally found a cure.&nbsp; It prevented him from having what they call &#8220;bamboo spine.&#8221;&nbsp; But he kept going back.&nbsp; I couldn&#8217;t understand why.&nbsp; I thought I knew why, but, Gov, he went back because he was trying to get an exemption to be able to join the United States Army.&nbsp; He was a sitting attorney general, and as all my colleagues &#8212; the Governor and Bobby Scott and Congresswoman &#8212; they all know is that when you do that &#8212; he joined the National Guard.&nbsp; And his unit deployed, and he wanted to deploy to Iraq with them.<br><br>So he literally had to give up his seat.&nbsp; Temporarily, he could not have any business done &#8212; as you National Guard folks know, you can&#8217;t do any business with a state if in fact &#8212; you&#8217;re now federal property.<br><br>And so, he gave up the seat and had the courage to appoint a fellow who had been a Republican attorney general as attorney general while he &#8212; while he went.&nbsp; The proudest thing he ever did &#8212; proudest thing he ever did.&nbsp;<br><br>And he &#8212; he spent a year in Iraq.&nbsp; And it was &#8212; it was one of the great honors of his life to do it.&nbsp; Won the Bronze Star, the Conspicuous Service Medal, and other awards &#8212; like many of you have &#8212; but he never, ever talked about it.<br><br>I remember we had an event at the White House &#8212; I shouldn&#8217;t be talking so much about my son, but I&#8217;m not going to apologize for it.&nbsp;<br><br>We had an event for Iraqi veterans at the White House and the President, without telling me and Jill, invited Beau to be there with another 75 soldiers and sailors and airmen.&nbsp; But he wouldn&#8217;t wear any of his decorations.&nbsp; And General Odierno called him &#8212; he served under him &#8212; and said, &#8220;Put them on now.&#8221;&nbsp; Swear to God.&nbsp; Walking out of the VP Residence, he wouldn&#8217;t put them on until then.&nbsp; That&#8217;s the first time I ever saw the Bronze Star on him.<br><br>But I&#8217;m just telling you that is &#8212; he&#8217;s like a lot of you.&nbsp; You do your duty.&nbsp; You don&#8217;t expect anything for it except be a little &#8212; have &#8212; get a little respect.&nbsp; It deserves so much more.&nbsp; You deserve so much more.<br><br>And, you know, I&#8217;m honored to be joined today by Governor Northam and by two great representatives of the Commonwealth: Congresswoman Luria and Congressman Scott.&nbsp; And I want to thank &#8212; thank you for all that you do to represent these service veterans, because they&#8217;re devoted to you; for the family members, the caregivers, survivors who call Virginia home.<br><br>I&#8217;m especially honored to share the stage with Brittney, and Jerdan, and Nathan, and Margrit Katherine.&nbsp; I love those barrettes in your hair, man.&nbsp; I tell you what &#8212; and look at her; she looks like she&#8217;s 19 years old, sitting there with her &#8212; like a little lady with her legs crossed.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;<br><br>Brittney, you’re doing triple duty: as a veteran, a military spouse, and a teacher.&nbsp; And, kids, thank you for being there for your mom.&nbsp;<br><br>I can remember all those times &#8212; and all of you remember, the spouses &#8212; when your husband or wife are deployed.&nbsp; Every morning, you wake up, you say that little extra prayer while you&#8217;re drinking your coffee.&nbsp; You just spend a little more time wondering.<br><br>And, you know, you only &#8212; you make up 1 percent of the population.&nbsp; You&#8217;re defending 99 percent of the rest of us.&nbsp; And we owe you.&nbsp; But you do your job so gracefully.&nbsp; You hardly ever say anything about what you&#8217;re doing.&nbsp;<br><br>But it matters.&nbsp; It matters to your families &#8212; for that time we&#8217;re sitting across from an empty chair at the kitchen table and the dining room table; for those birthdays or Christmases or holidays when they&#8217;re gone.<br><br>You know, there&#8217;s a famous English poet who said, &#8220;They also serve who only stand and wait.&#8221;&nbsp; &#8220;Also serve who only stand and wait.&#8221;<br><br>I know Major Beene &#8212; having been deployed to Afghanistan during the pandemic has only made everything much harder during the pandemic.&nbsp; I want to thank you so much &#8212; your entire family’s service to our country.&nbsp; You&#8217;re all incredible.&nbsp; You so underestimate how important you are.<br><br>And there&#8217;s nothing that Jill and I enjoy more than spending time with our troops here and abroad &#8212; if you&#8217;re stationed here United States or deployed around the world.<br><br>I&#8217;ve been in and out of Iraq and Afghanistan over 20 &#8212; I think it&#8217;s 25 times.&nbsp; And I&#8217;ve seen &#8212; I wish everyone could see what you do when you&#8217;re there.&nbsp; I wish they could see every day how you saddle up, how you jump in that cockpit.&nbsp; Just see &#8212; no, you&#8217;re just &#8212; just doing your job.&nbsp;<br><br>Not to mention all of the troops I&#8217;ve had the chance to visit in the Middle East and Europe and the Indo-Pacific region.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve traveled all over.&nbsp; Jill has traveled all over with me and her own visits to servicemembers in Iraq.&nbsp; I think she&#8217;s the only Second Lady ever to go into the middle of a warzone, because she wanted to be there and see you.<br><br>I always want you to know &#8212; always &#8212; that the issues you and your family are facing, we need to know how we can support you better.&nbsp; I mean it sincerely from the bottom of my heart: support you better.&nbsp;<br><br>There&#8217;s reason for that.&nbsp; I said, we Bidens are proud to have family in the military.&nbsp; And our son Beau&#8217;s service was &#8212; was among the achievements, as I said, he was most proud of.<br><br>My heart swelled to see him in uniform.&nbsp;<br><br>When I went into Iraq &#8212; I was there for five times &#8212; when he was in Baghdad.&nbsp; (Laughs.)&nbsp; And I remember, the first time I saw him, his name was &#8220;Hunter.&#8221;&nbsp; I said, &#8220;What in the hell happened?&#8221;&nbsp; He said, &#8220;Dad, I didn&#8217;t want anybody to do me any special favors because my Vice President is my dad.&#8221;&nbsp; He got permission to put a different nametag on.<br><br>I also remember what it was like to listen to him talk about the needs that people had when he got back home.&nbsp; About all the folks he served with who came back with post-traumatic stress, and he was back being attorney general, having to deal with that.<br><br>But here&#8217;s the point: You do so much and you ask for so little.&nbsp; You know, our experience is a fraction of what so many of you and your families have gone through &#8212; a family like Brittney and her kids.&nbsp; You&#8217;re the absolute best America has to offer: our heart, our honor, your solid steel spine.&nbsp;<br><br>So my message to all of you is quite simply: Thank you.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Not &#8220;thank you for your service&#8221; &#8212; just thank you for who you are, because it&#8217;s contagious.&nbsp; Thank you for choosing a selfless service to your country.<br><br>I know we have mostly soldiers and airmen in attendance today, but there can be a lot of friendly rivalries on a base.&nbsp; Each branch has its own proud, cherished traditions and culture.&nbsp; I know how proud Langley is of their premier 5th-generation F-22 Raptor Wing.&nbsp; Oh, God, I&#8217;d love to go up in one of those.&nbsp;<br><br>I asked, &#8220;I&#8217;m your Commander-in-Chief.&nbsp; Why the hell can&#8217;t I command you let me go up in one?&#8221;&nbsp; But, you know, they won&#8217;t let me do that.<br><br>And Fort Eustis hosts one of Army&#8217;s busiest airfields, which is led by the Air Force, primarily used by the Navy.&nbsp; (Laughs.)&nbsp; It&#8217;s all about as joint as it can possibly get.<br><br>Every day, the more than 20,000 members of the Air Force and Army, along with civilian personnel, come to work with a shared mission.&nbsp; No matter which branch of our armed forces you proudly represent, you&#8217;re part of the greatest fighting force in the history of the world.&nbsp; That&#8217;s not hyperbole.&nbsp; The greatest fighting force in the history of the world.&nbsp;<br><br>You&#8217;re integral to the most powerful nation in the world.&nbsp; There&#8217;s been no Army, Navy, or Air Force ever like you &#8212; or Marines.&nbsp;<br><br>Here at Joint Base Langley-Eustis, you enable the success of our mission around the world.&nbsp; You provide intelligence support and airpower.&nbsp; You ensure our soldiers and airmen are ready, trained to deploy the COCOMs around the world &#8212; including, this year, adhering to COVID-19 safety protocols and quarantines before to ship out in order to minimize the spread of the virus.&nbsp;<br><br>I know that many of you deployed yourselves, probably more than once.&nbsp; Over the past 20 years, our volunteer force and our military families have made incredible sacrifices for this country.&nbsp;<br><br>Early in my term as Vice President, when I traveled overseas, I&#8217;d sometimes meet service men and women who were deployed their fourth, fifth, sixth times.&nbsp; I remember going into Baghdad, just remember &#8212; and those of you who had to fly in, you do those circular deals so we wouldn&#8217;t get shot at, we wouldn&#8217;t get hit.&nbsp;<br><br>I walked up in the cockpit of a silver bullet that they had me in.&nbsp; And I asked &#8212; I said, &#8220;How many…&#8221; &#8212; there were five people in the cockpit at the time &#8212; the loadmaster as well.&nbsp; I said, &#8220;How many is this your first tour?&#8221;&nbsp; Nobody raised their hand.&nbsp; &#8220;How many the second tour?&#8221;&nbsp; Nobody raised their hand.&nbsp; &#8220;Third tour?&#8221;&nbsp; Two raised their hand.&nbsp; &#8220;Fourth tour?&#8221;&nbsp; Two raised their hand.&nbsp; &#8220;Fifth tour?&#8221;&nbsp; One raised their hand.&nbsp; No other war have you gone in, served, and got back up and go back again and again and again.&nbsp; Once.&nbsp; Once.&nbsp;<br><br>Wiping the blood off the seat of an up-armored HMMWV is enough to get you focused.&nbsp; Then to saddle up next time and go back and back again?&nbsp; You&#8217;re incredible.&nbsp; You&#8217;re incredible.&nbsp;<br><br>The country &#8212; they owe you, and they&#8217;re &#8212; this time, they&#8217;re more appreciative.&nbsp; In my generation, you didn&#8217;t come home and get off an airplane in a uniform in an airport coming back from Vietnam.&nbsp; People will treat you with respect, but they have no idea the sacrifices you make in theater.&nbsp;<br><br>As we bring &#8212; as we get close to bringing down the longest war drawdown in American history &#8212; our troop presence in Afghanistan &#8212; I want to recognize the significance to &#8212; of what all of you, the United States Armed Forces, have accomplished in the past 20 years.<br><br>Went to Afghanistan with a clear purpose: to get the people who attacked us on 9/11 and to prevent al Qaeda from using Afghanistan as a base from which to attack America in the future.&nbsp; To achieve that purpose &#8212; you achieved that purpose.&nbsp; Year after year, deployment after deployment, American troops pursued the terrorist threat through some of the most unforgiving terrain on the planet.&nbsp;<br><br>I have now had the pleasure, as they say, of being to every part of Afghanistan, from the FOBs up in the Kunar Valley; down south, looking at all those poppy fields; and all in between.&nbsp; It&#8217;s one godforsaken landscape.&nbsp;<br><br>But you all just showed up and did your job, and it helped make sure there hasn&#8217;t been another attack on the homeland from Afghanistan for the last 20 years.&nbsp; And you never gave up until we delivered justice to Osama bin Laden.<br><br>I got criticized after 9/11 for saying, “We’ll follow the son of a bi- &#8212; gun to the gates of hell until we get him.”&nbsp; It&#8217;s exactly what you did.&nbsp; That’s exactly what you did.&nbsp; And you got him.<br><br>And now, as we draw down, we&#8217;re also going to focus on the urgent work of rebuilding over-the-horizon capabilities that’ll allow us to take out al Qaeda if they return to Afghanistan &#8212; but to focus on the threat that has metastasized.&nbsp;<br><br>The greatest threat and likelihood of attack from al Qaeda or ISIS is not going to be from Afghanistan; it&#8217;s going to be from five other regions of the world that have significantly more presence of both al Qaeda and organizational structures, including ISIS.<br><br>We&#8217;re going to update our security stance and turn our forces to the threats that will dominate our future to ensure the security of the American people for decades to come.&nbsp;<br><br>But we’ll never, ever, ever forget the terrible cost that we paid as a nation.&nbsp; Many of you likely have lost friends and colleagues in Afghanistan and Iraq.&nbsp; I know this is personal to you, especially as you head into Memorial Day weekend.&nbsp; We as a nation will always remember and pay tribute to those we lost.&nbsp;<br><br>After I announced my decision to end the war in Afghanistan, the first thing I did was visit &#8212; visit Section 60 of Arlington National Cemetery &#8212; just walked through those headstones, seeing all those stones.&nbsp;<br><br>Our son did not die in Iraq, but he came back &#8212; went as an incredibly healthy young man and came back with a severe brain tumor because his hooch was just downwind from those burn pits &#8212; I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s the reason.&nbsp; But he came home &#8212; it was just a matter of how long he lived.&nbsp;<br><br>I still carry with me &#8212; every single solitary day I have my staff, for the last &#8212; since the war began &#8212; I have my schedule.&nbsp; In the back of my schedule, it says, “U.S. daily troop update.&nbsp; U.S. troops died in Iraq and Afghanistan: 6,927” &#8212; not “over 6,000.”&nbsp; Total fallen angels across the board: over 7,000.<br><br>Every one of these lives lost is a tragedy, an empty seat at the dinner table, a missing voice at the holidays.&nbsp; Every one of them left behind a whole community &#8212; not just one, a whole community.&nbsp; We can never repay that debt.&nbsp; But I promise you this &#8212; and to all the Gold Star families across the country: We will never, ever, ever, ever forget.&nbsp;<br><br>Each year, Memorial Day offers us a chance to reflect on the enormity of the sacrifices that generation after generation of Americans has made and the responsibilities that we bear &#8212; the citizens bear in return.&nbsp;<br><br>I&#8217;ve said many times &#8212; it used to get me in trouble 25 years ago, 30 years ago in the Senate &#8212; I said, “America has many obligations.&nbsp; We only have one sacred obligation.&nbsp; We have obligations to our children, to the elderly, and so many more things, but only one sacred obligation &#8212; is to prepare you, when we send you into harm&#8217;s way, with everything you need; to care for your families when you&#8217;re gone; when you come home, care for you and your families, and the needs that may be a consequence of the war.&#8221;<br><br>We owe it.&nbsp; We owe it to you. &nbsp;We particularly owe it to their memories to affirm the very best of what America stands for &#8212; to uphold honor and democratic values that are the foundation and the strength of this nation.<br><br>You know, I sometimes get criticized for saying what I deeply believe, having done this for the bulk of my life.&nbsp; We&#8217;re in a &#8212; we&#8217;re in a battle between democracies and autocracies.&nbsp; The more complicated the world becomes, the more difficult it is for democracies to come together and reach consensus.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve spent more time with President Xi of China than any world leader has &#8212; for 24 hours of private meetings with him with just an interpreter; 17,000 miles traveling with him in China and here.&nbsp;He firmly believes that China, before the year &#8217;30, &#8217;35,&nbsp; is going to own America because autocracies can make quick decisions.&nbsp;<br><br>But America is unique.&nbsp; From all nations in the world, we&#8217;re the only nation organized based on an idea.&nbsp; Every other nation you can define by their ethnicity, their geography, their religion, except America.&nbsp; America is born out of an idea: &#8220;We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men [and women] are created equal… endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable Rights, [including] Life, Liberty,&#8221; et cetera.&nbsp;<br><br>None of you get your rights from your government; you get your rights merely because you&#8217;re a child of God.&nbsp; The government is there to protect those God-given rights.&nbsp; No other government has been based on that notion.&nbsp; No one can defeat us except us.&nbsp;<br><br>It’s an idea that generations of patriots have fought and died for to defend it.&nbsp; I know that&#8217;s a conviction that each and every day you all share.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why you joined up, why you run around danger when duty calls.&nbsp;<br><br>It&#8217;s my greatest honor &#8212; it should not surprise anybody; it should be anybody&#8217;s greatest honor in all of life &#8212; to be able to serve as your Commander-in-Chief.&nbsp; No greater honor.<br><br>So, thank you.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Thank you for spending this time with me today.&nbsp; And thank you for your commitment to our country, because without you, as I said &#8212; I&#8217;ll be &#8212; end where I began: You are the spine of America &#8212; the spine.&nbsp;<br><br>And I can&#8217;t tell you how much it matters.&nbsp; I think you underestimate just the consequence of who you are and what you do.&nbsp;<br><br>So, thank you.&nbsp; May God bless you.&nbsp; And may God protect our troops.&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>2:29 P.M. EDT</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Aboard Air Force One<br>En Route Hampton, Virginia</p>



<p>1:24 P.M. EDT</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp;&nbsp;This afternoon, at Joint Base Langley-Eustis, the President and the First Lady will address service members and their families and thank them for their sacrifices.&nbsp;&nbsp;They will speak from their personal experience as a proud military family; the President’s long history working on foreign policy and visiting troops aboard [abroad]; and the First Lady’s work to support military and veteran families, caregivers, and survivors, including through Joining Forces.</p>



<p>Finally, the President will reflect on the service of the armed forces in Afghanistan and Iraq, and the debt &#8212; the debt owed to those who made the ultimate sacrifice for our country.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m going to read the statement from the Press Secretary, Jen Psaki, on Memorial Day weekend and the gas prices because I &#8212; we know that there&#8217;s been a lot of inquiry on this.</p>



<p>Across America, the pandemic is in retreat.&nbsp; As we continue to make progress and our life returns to normal, Americans are eager to make up for lost time and more people are traveling this Memorial Day weekend.</p>



<p>And as Americans are hitting the road, they are paying less, in real terms, for gas than they have on average over the last 15 years.&nbsp; And they&#8217;re paying &#8212; they&#8217;re paying about the same as they did in May 2018 and May 2019.&nbsp; The administration&#8217;s success in beating the pandemic and getting our economy back on track has led to increased demand for gas as the &#8212; as the country reopens.</p>



<p>But while price &#8212; prices have increased from the lows last year as demand drastically dipped, prices at just about $3 per gallon are still well in line with what there have been &#8212; what they&#8217;ve been in recent decades.</p>



<p>And last week, prices have already stabilized after a spike earlier this month as the Colonial Pipeline is fully flowing and the supply situation returns to normal.&nbsp; This is due in part to the administration&#8217;s aggressive whole-of-government response to the unprecedented shutdown of the pipeline.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While oil prices are shaped by glo- &#8212; global forces, the President knows that gas prices are a pa- &#8212; a pain point for Americans, especially the middle-class families he&#8217;s put at the center of our economic agenda.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why President Biden is oppose &#8212; opposed any proposal to raise the gas tax.&nbsp; And that is why he will &#8212; we will continue to monitor prices and are glad that Americans can get on the road again.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s a quick preview of the President&#8217;s schedule next week: On Sunday, he will deliver remarks during the Memorial Day service hosted by the Delaware Commission of Veterans Affairs at Veterans Memorial Park at the Delaware Memorial Bridge.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On Monday, the President will return to Washington, D.C.&nbsp; He and the First Lady, the Vice President, and the Second Gentleman will participate in a wreath-laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldiers at Arlington Ceme- &#8212; National Cemetery.&nbsp; The President will also deliver remarks on the National Memorial Day Observance.</p>



<p>On Tuesday, the President will travel to Tulsa, Oklahoma; deliver remarks; and he’ll commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Tulsa Race Massacre.&nbsp; He’ll also meet with surviving members of the community who are now between the age of 101 and 107.</p>



<p>On Wednesday, the President will deliver remarks on the COVID-19 response.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And on Friday, President Biden will deliver remarks on the economy.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ll take a few questions, as we just landed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karine, the Senate defeated the September &#8212; the January 6th commission today.&nbsp; Can we get a response from the President and what he wants to see next?&nbsp; And could that include a select committee from the House?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; So, as the President said during his speech before a joint session of Congress, in &#8212; in the very place that had been des- &#8212; desecrated during the insurrection, the events of January 6th represented an existential crisis of our democracy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That&#8217;s why the President supported the bipartisan commission that was proposed and why he consistently called for a full and independent investigation into what happened and how we can ensure something like that could never happen again.</p>



<p>Members of the Senate aren&#8217;t sent to Washington to &#8212; to rubberstamp any party&#8217;s views.&nbsp; They swear on &#8212; an oath to support and defend the Constitution.&nbsp; And today, unfortunately, they failed to do that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As far as the alternative option that you asked, Jonathan, the President has been clear that the shameful events of January 6th need to be independently and fully investigated.&nbsp; He remains committed to that, and we will continue to work with Congress to find a path forward to ensure that happens.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is he considering forming a presidential commission?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have anything else to share.&nbsp; He truly believes that this should be done on a bipartisan &#8212; in a bipartisan way.</p>



<p>We have to remember, when it &#8212; when it passed the House, it was a bipartisan pass where 35 Republicans voted for it.&nbsp; And he believes the Senate should have &#8212; do the same.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you give us an update on Belarus sanctions?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have any more updates.&nbsp; As I mentioned, the President&#8217;s team is going to put together some options for him.&nbsp; And more &#8212; there will be more to come.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The New York Times reported that there was a raft of unexplored evidence into this sort of Wuhan &#8212; the origins of the coronavirus.&nbsp; Can you talk a little bit about how much unexamined intelligence there is and whether that&#8217;s why the President asked for a &#8212; was part of the reason the President asked for a larger review?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Thanks for your question, Annie.&nbsp; Look, we do not comment on intelligence, as you can imagine.&nbsp; We&#8217;re going to &#8212; we&#8217;re going to continue to look at the intelligence.&nbsp; We believe there&#8217;s more work to do, hence the 90-day review.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How does &#8212; how does the latest reported hack that&#8217;s attributed to Russia impact the summit that&#8217;s coming up between the President and Putin?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; There&#8217;s been no changes to &#8212; to the summit.&nbsp; We&#8217;re going to move forward with that, as you can imagine.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the White House concern on the &#8212; on the cyberattack though?&nbsp; What &#8212; how concerned is the White House about this escalation?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; So, we are &#8212; we are aware of the phishing incident and we are monitoring the situation.&nbsp; The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency is managing this incident and working with USAID.&nbsp; We refer you to USAID and CISA.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But I&#8217;ll say while we may &#8212; while we may learn more, this is basic phishing which is blocked by most systems automatically.&nbsp; As Microsoft&#8217;s blog noted, it&#8217;s likely to have been blocked by automatic &#8212; automated system as spam.&nbsp; If an email got by the automated system, a user would still have to click on the link to activate the malicious payload.&nbsp; And we should all know better than to click links in unknown emails.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I direct you to the USAID or CISA for further questions.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secretary Mayorkas spoke positively about the vaccine &#8212; the possibility of a vaccine passport today.&nbsp; Can you clear up where the administration stands on this?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; I mean, it&#8217;s &#8212; we haven&#8217;t moved on our &#8212; on our stance on this.&nbsp; There will be no federal vaccination database and no federal mandate requiring everyone to obtain a single vaccination credential.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you explain what he meant then by his comments?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Again, the U.S. government recognizes that other countries have or may have foreign-entry requirements.&nbsp; We will be monitoring these and helping all U.S. travelers meet those, but we will not be &#8212; there will be no federal mandate requiring anyone to obtain a single vaccination credential.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you have a quick White House response to Republican criticism over the size of President Biden&#8217;s budget?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Look, we &#8212; as you know, we got our &#8212; the counteroffer.  We will be working this weekend, and taking a look &#8212; a deep look, a deep dive into what the counteroffer was &#8212; was presented by Capito and her &#8212; and the senators there.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I actually meant the budget.</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Oh, the budget.&nbsp; I&#8217;m so sorry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That&#8217;s okay.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; I&#8217;m so sorry.&nbsp; I am so sorry about that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All good.</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Things are moving so quickly.&nbsp; The budget will be released soon, so I&#8217;m not going to get ahead of it.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It&#8217;s out now.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Oh, okay.&nbsp; Well &#8212; (laughs) &#8212; so, like &#8212; well, I have not seen it.&nbsp; So, is it &#8212;</p>



<p>AIDE:&nbsp; (Inaudible) 1:30.</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; But here&#8217;s what I can say &#8212; here&#8217;s what I can say about the budget: When the President took office, Congress had already spent more than $3 trillion trying to get the pandemic crisis under control.&nbsp; And there was more work to do, which is why he took the decisive action to get the economy back on track through American Rescue Plan.</p>



<p>The budget does exactly what the President told the country that he would do: grow the economy, create jobs, advance his Jobs Plan and his Families Plan, and do so responsibly by requiring the wealthiest Americans and big corporations to pay their fair share.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The economic plan is already showing results: New unemployment claims are down almost 50 percent since he took office.&nbsp; He&#8217;s created more new jobs than any President in his first month in office.&nbsp; And growth is at 40 &#8212; 40th-year high.</p>



<p>AIDE:&nbsp; Okay, thank you.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; We have to go.&nbsp; And I didn&#8217;t &#8212; I lost track of time.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t realize it was past 1:30.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thanks, guys.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.</p>

<p>MR. FRIEDLANDER:&nbsp; Hey, everyone.&nbsp; This is Rob from the OMB Communications team.&nbsp; Thanks so much for joining us.&nbsp; This will be an on-the-record call about the President’s Fiscal Year 2022 Budget.</p>



<p>We will be joined by Shalanda Young, Acting Director of OMB; as well as Cecilia Rouse, Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers.&nbsp; They’ll each make some brief comments at the top, and then we’ll have time to take some questions at the end.</p>



<p>As a reminder, this call will be on-the-record and embargoed until 1:30 p.m. Eastern Time today, along with the materials you&#8217;ve received also under embargo until 1:30 p.m. today.</p>



<p>And with that, I will turn it over to Acting Director Young.</p>



<p>ACTING DIRECTOR YOUNG:&nbsp; Well, thanks, Rob.&nbsp; And thanks to all of you for joining.&nbsp; I want to start with a very quick overview of this year’s budget process, which, many of you know, looks a little different in a transition year.</p>



<p>Back in April, we released the topline information for the President’s discretionary request for Fiscal Year 2022, which provided Congress with guidance on his funding priorities to help inform the appropriations process.</p>



<p>That discretionary request recommended that Congress reinvest robustly in areas like public health, education, basic science, and clean energy.&nbsp; The country had been weakened by a decade of disinvestment in these areas, which were squeezed under restrictive budget caps.&nbsp; The discretionary request issued a clear call for Congress to reinvest in these areas, restoring nondefense appropriations to its historical average share of the economy.</p>



<p>Additionally, the President also unveiled his American Jobs Plan and American Families Plan.&nbsp; Together, these two will be transformational: strengthening our economy, boosting American competitiveness, and delivering shared prosperity and economic security.</p>



<p>Today, we’re releasing a budget that puts these pieces together and does exactly what the President told the country he would do: grow the economy, create jobs, and do so responsibly by requiring the wealthiest Americans and big corporations to pay their fair share.</p>



<p>Already, we know that the President’s economic plan is working.&nbsp; New unemployment claims are down 60 percent since he took office, the economy created more new jobs in the President’s first 100 days than the first 100 days of any President on record, and growth is stronger than anyone expected.&nbsp; And this budget outlines the next steps in that plan.</p>



<p>The budget investments &#8212; the budget starts with the American Jobs Plan &#8212; a once-in-a-generation investment in America that will put millions of people to work rebuilding our country &#8212; fixing highways, rebuilding bridges, and upgrading our transit systems; replacing all lead pipes and service lines in our drinking water systems; investing in the infrastructure of our care economy and creating new and better jobs for caregiving workers; and much, much more.</p>



<p>The budget also includes the President’s American Families Plan &#8212; a historic investment in the middle class and in the pathways to the middle class, including education, healthcare, and childcare.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And the budget also incorporates the President’s discretionary request.&nbsp; For example, it calls for $6.5 billion to launch ARPA-H &#8212; a historic 20-billion-dollar increase for Title I schools to advance educational opportunity for all students; the largest budget authority increase at the CDC in nearly two decades to help rebuild its capacity to detect, prepare for, and respond to emerging global threats; and $36 billion in discretionary climate investments, just to name a few.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And finally, the budget reiterates the President’s strong call to Congress during his joint address to move on healthcare &#8212; reducing the costs of prescription drug, and expanding and improving health coverage.</p>



<p>Put together, this budget is an agenda for robust, durable economic growth and broadly shared prosperity.&nbsp; It will deliver a strong economy now and for decades into the future.&nbsp; And it is in an investment in Americans all across the country who power our economy.</p>



<p>The budget makes these investments in a way that’s responsive to both the near- and medium-term economic landscape, as well as the long-term challenges our country faces.</p>



<p>In the near-term, the decades-long, global trend of declining interest rates, even as publicly held debt has increased, gives us the fiscal space to make necessary upfront investments.</p>



<p>Under the budget policies, the real cost of federal debt payments will remain below the historical average through the coming decade, even as the budget assumes that interest rates will rise from their current lows, consistent with private-sector forecasts.&nbsp; Low real debt service payments show that the cost of these upfront investments is not burdening the economy.&nbsp;&nbsp;To the contrast, failing to make these investments at a time of such low interest costs would be an historic missed opportunity that would leave future generations worse off.</p>



<p>This budget does not make that mistake, and it invests &#8212; its investments will pay dividends for generations to come.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over the long run, when we face larger fiscal challenges and more uncertainty about interest rates, the budget will reduce the deficit and improve our nation’s finances.</p>



<p>That’s because its frontloaded investments are more than paid for through permanent tax reforms that will ensure corporations and the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share.</p>



<p>You’ll see, in summary tables that all of you should have, that the budget policies reduce annual deficits beginning in 2030 and by increasing amounts thereafter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It also shows that the budget policies reduce deficits in every year beyond the 10-year window and by over $2 trillion in the subsequent decade.</p>



<p>And it also shows that the American Jobs Plan and the American Families Plan are fully offset within 15 years.</p>



<p>So, as a whole, the budget will improve our nation’s long-term finances while making the growth-enhancing investments that we need right now.</p>



<p>With that, let me turn it over to Chairwoman Rouse to talk about the budget’s economic assumptions and the economic outlook under the budget’s policies.</p>



<p>CHAIR ROUSE:&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; And thank you for you time today.&nbsp; I want to use this opportunity to cover two important elements of the budget: the economic motivation and the economic forecast behind its policies.</p>



<p>As Acting Director Young just mentioned, this is a very important and forward-looking budget.&nbsp; The policies proposed are premised on the idea that, to move forward as a country, we need to invest in innovation.&nbsp; And the public sector is critical to building a robust and inclusive economy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When the government invests in infrastructure and families, it acts a partner, not a rival, to private business.&nbsp; When it underinvests in these public goods, it diminishes the private sector&#8217;s productivity and its ability to grow, hire, and invest.</p>



<p>Moreover, when the public sector doesn&#8217;t fulfill its side of the partnership with the private sector, the harm is not equally felt.&nbsp; Low-income neighborhoods and communities of color bear the brunt of the harm.</p>



<p>A robust &#8212; a robust body of economic evidence has found that investments like these in the budget pay off for years to come in the form of stronger economic growth, less reliance on transfer benefits, and greater tax revenue.</p>



<p>The President has proposed a comprehensive tax plan to offset these investments by asking corporations and wealthy individuals to shoulder their fair share of the tax burden.</p>



<p>Most importantly, it is imperative that this country makes up for decades of underinvestment in important parts of our country, which, as I noted earlier, will pay off in the long run.</p>



<p>Typically, when policies like this are proposed, they are baked into the budget forecast.&nbsp; And typically, a three-months&#8217; difference between when a forecast is done and when the budget is proposed is not really a big deal.</p>



<p>But I don&#8217;t need to tell you that this year was unlike any other in modern history.&nbsp; When we did the forecast in early February, the world looked much different than it does today.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At that point, it was unclear how we could successfully stand up a national vaccination program, how fast we could get those shots into arms, how effective the shots would be, and how much vaccinating a nation would free up consumers to spend and businesses to reopen.</p>



<p>In addition, the American Jobs Plan and the American Families Plan &#8212; the cornerstone of the budget &#8212; were in the early stages of development.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That February forecast projected real GDP growth at 5.2 percent in 2021, and 3.2 percent in 2022.</p>



<p>We began the year with a 6.3 percent unemployment rate and expected it to fall to 5.5 percent by the end of 2021, and 4.1 percent by the end of 2022.</p>



<p>We also expected short-term interest rates to rise slowly as the economy approached full employment and inflation to stabilize around 2 percent.</p>



<p>There are two important reasons why our current economic reality looks different from our February forecast.&nbsp; First, the economic reality on the ground, as summer looms, is very different than last winter.&nbsp; Recovery and real GDP has outperformed our expectations thus far.&nbsp; More than half of adults in the United States have been fully vaccinated, accelerating a full reopening.&nbsp; The consensus forecast for real GDP growth during 2021 has climbed from 5.0 to 7.0 percent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Aside from GDP, two other components of the forecast that have been revised up as well: the consensus view about 10-year yield and the expectation for 2021 inflation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Second, as I noted earlier, the forecast does not fully reflect the policies proposed in the budget.&nbsp; This is a solid &#8212;</p>



<p>a budget that reflects President Biden&#8217;s vision for investing in people and society, and ensures that the economy grows and that everyone shares in the prosperity.&nbsp; And it understands that the public sector is a key component in moving us forward.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thank you for your time.</p>



<p>MR. FRIEDLANDER:&nbsp; Great, thanks very much.&nbsp; Moderator, we&#8217;ll be ready to take some questions now.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, hi.&nbsp; This is Asma with National Public Radio.&nbsp; I just wanted to better understand, you know, how you&#8217;re addressing some of the concerns that have been risen, particularly from fiscal hawks, that even though interest rates are low right now and these are investments you need to do, that if you don&#8217;t sort of tackle the gaping structural deficit problem that the country is in, it will be enormously difficult to deal with the debt problem over the long term.</p>



<p>ACTING DIRECTOR YOUNG:&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Thank you for that question.&nbsp; You know, that is certainly one way to look at the budget.&nbsp; There are also other metrics of how you look at this with sustainability.&nbsp; And we certainly believe that the President&#8217;s budget improves the long-term fiscal outlook because his policies are more than paid for over the long run.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So this President is putting forth a historic, staggering agenda that changes the long-term view of how this country invests in its infrastructure and brings its competitiveness with those like China back to where we should be &#8212; which is first in the world &#8212; while ensuring that he not only offsets his policies, but improves the deficit picture, starting in 2030, and by cutting deficits over &#8212; by over $2 trillion in the 10 years after that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That is a sharp departure from unpaid tax cuts under the prior administration that seriously wor- &#8212; worsened our long-term fiscal problems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But for the near term and the medium term, we believe the most important test of our fiscal health is real interest payments on the debt. &nbsp;That&#8217;s what tells us whether debt is burdening our economy and crowding out other investments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This budget takes advantage of the fiscal space created by historically low interest rates to make urgently needed investments that will contribute to growth and shared prosperity.&nbsp; Under the budget&#8217;s policies, the real cost of federal debt payments will remain below the historical average through the coming decades, showing that the cost of these upfront investments is not burdening the economy.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wall Street Journal.&nbsp; This is a question, I guess, for Chairwoman Rouse on the economic assumptions.&nbsp; So you mentioned the consensus forecast for GDP 10-year yields and inflation &#8212; how those have shifted.&nbsp; Could you tell us &#8212; and maybe I just misunderstood &#8212; how the White House forecasts have changed?&nbsp; Like what are you actually expecting this year and maybe next year for real GDP rates and inflation at this point?</p>



<p>CHAIR ROUSE:&nbsp; So, you know, we did this like a forecast, which is led by the CEA, but very much in conjunction with OMB and the Treasury Department.&nbsp; And we developed that forecast in early February.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But, you know, just like you are, we&#8217;re watching the economy, and we can see that GDP growth in the first quarter came in at 6.4 percent.&nbsp; You know, we have seen unemployment come down.&nbsp; You know, we just got to PCE numbers on inflation, which shows that people are spending and the economy is opening up.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, you know, if we were revising today, we would certainly be reflecting these new economic realities into our forecasts.&nbsp; But we don&#8217;t update the forecast, you know, mid-cycle in this way because we need to develop the budget in time for agencies to develop their own budgets.&nbsp; And if we were to have revised the budget, it would have delayed this budget roll- &#8212; if we revised our forecast that would have delayed this budget rollout even further, which we didn&#8217;t think would be such a wise thing to do.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, thanks.&nbsp; Yeah, Niv Elis from The Hill.&nbsp; So I have two questions.&nbsp; One is, it looks like the net interest that&#8217;s going to be paid rises to $914 billion by the end of the decade, which is 40 percent more than the primary deficit.&nbsp; So with net interest costs getting that high, can you sort of explain how that counts as a responsible fiscal course when so much is just going to pay off the debt?</p>



<p>The other question is also about GDP.&nbsp; You talked about how the &#8212; this forecast didn&#8217;t incorporate the effects of the Jobs Plan and the Families Plan.&nbsp; Do you have forecasts as to how those would increase GDP if they are enacted?&nbsp;</p>



<p>ACTING DIRECTOR YOUNG:&nbsp; So, I&#8217;ll start with the interest-rate question and let the Chairwoman jump in on GDP.&nbsp; But, as you point out, our budget does build in assumptions about a future rise in interest rates.&nbsp; That&#8217;s the responsible thing to do, and that&#8217;s exactly what you see.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even with assumed interest &#8212; increase in interest rates, real interest payments on the federal debt, which are a key test of fiscal health, remain low by historical standards throughout the coming decade, showing that this budget puts the nation on sound fiscal course for the near term.</p>



<p>Like CBO and market forecasters, we don&#8217;t assume that interest rates go all the way back to the last seen &#8212; level seen several decades ago.&nbsp; That&#8217;s because the decline in interest rates is a global persistent phenomenon; it has not been temporary or localized.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And that being said, things could change.&nbsp; And we recognize that the long-run outlook is more uncertain.&nbsp; That&#8217;s one of the reasons why the President has put forward proposals to pay for all of his policies and, in fact, reduces deficits over time by reforming our tax system so that corporations and the very wealthy pay their fair share.</p>



<p>CHAIR ROUSE:&nbsp; Terrific.&nbsp; And so, this is Cecilia Rouse, and I&#8217;ll take the second question about the impacts of the AJP and the AFP.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So just &#8212; just as a reminder, when we made the budget forecast, it was early February.&nbsp; And, nonetheless, we do assume that at 10 years out &#8212; in 2031 &#8212; that real GDP growth would be about &#8212; would be at 10 &#8212; at 2.0 percent.&nbsp; So when we made this forecast, we did include some &#8212; we did expect some positive growth effects from some of the investments that we knew we wanted to be able to make, but we hadn&#8217;t fully developed those programs at that time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, you know, in terms of the protect &#8212; projected impact of the AJP and the AFP on the economy, I will refer you to Mark Zandi&#8217;s forecast.&nbsp; And he projects that these two programs &#8212; by 2030, that we will have GDP at 2.3 percent and unemployment will have fallen under 3.8 percent.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, this is Benjy Sarlin with NBC News.&nbsp; I just want to ask about a pair of healthcare reforms that seem to be mentioned in the factsheet: the drug reform and the public option.&nbsp; I was wondering if you could explain to me exactly where they fit into this budget.&nbsp; Is there a specific proposal that is being incorporated into assumption?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Or is this more just a general statement that the White House would like Congress to eventually pass something on this without further details?&nbsp; And if so, why is there not a more detailed incorporation into this budget?</p>



<p>ACTING DIRECTOR YOUNG:&nbsp; Hey, thanks for that.&nbsp; We &#8212; we love to talk about healthcare policy, so thanks for giving us the opportunity to do that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One, I do want to make sure we note, in the Families Plan &#8212; so a part of this budget &#8212; the President does have a robust healthcare proposal.&nbsp; It makes permanent &#8212; it will make permanent the premium tax credit improvements that, as we all know, helped millions of people gain coverage and reduce premiums for millions more.&nbsp; This budget also invests $400 billion in improving home- and community-based services for older people and people with disabilities.</p>



<p>What the budget does &#8212; I think you&#8217;re referring to &#8212; is also calls on Congress to act this year &#8212; the President is very clear he would like to see action this year &#8212; to reduce prescription drug costs; strengthen ACA, Medicaid, and Medicare coverage; and create additional public coverage options.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We know there are proposals on the Hill being introduced, and we believe that it is more productive to work collaboratively with Congress to develop and build consensus around the specific policies that achieve his broad goals.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, hey. &nbsp;Ben White at Politico.&nbsp; Thanks for doing this.&nbsp; I just want to go back to the growth projections for a second.&nbsp; I mean, obviously you’ve talked about how this was done in February pre-AJP and AFP.&nbsp; Do we just disregard these projections as too small?&nbsp; Because they&#8217;re relatively tepid growth rates for the kind of investments you&#8217;re talking about making.&nbsp; How should we think about that?&nbsp; Should we just discount this as, you know, old numbers?&nbsp; And should we expect much faster growth going forward?&nbsp; Or how should we think about it?</p>



<p>CHAIR ROUSE:&nbsp; Well, a great &#8212; good question.&nbsp; So again, our budget does assume that real GDP growth is at 2.0 percent 10 years out &#8212; so that&#8217;s in 2031.&nbsp; So we want to put that 2.0 long-term forecast in perspective.&nbsp; The Congressional Budget Office&#8217;s projection, which was also released in February, used then-current law assumptions.&nbsp; So it didn&#8217;t include the ARP &#8212; the American Rescue Plan; the AJP; or the AFP, and it reaches GDP of 1.6 percent in 2031.&nbsp; The median Federal Reserve long-term growth forecast back in mid-March was 1.8 percent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So I want to just highlight this seemingly small difference in &#8212; differences in real GDP growth can end up having enormous effects on the output and income that our economy generates over time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, for example, let&#8217;s take a difference between the CBO’s 2031 real GDP growth projection, 1.6 percent, and our 2 percent 2031 forecast.&nbsp; So that&#8217;s a difference of 0.4 percentage points each year in the long term.&nbsp; That 0.4 percentage point difference in real growth would translate into the U.S. economy cumulatively producing $4.8 trillion more over a decade in inflation-adjusted 2019 dollars.&nbsp; So that&#8217;s roughly $1 trillion more than the annual GDP of Germany.&nbsp; That just shy of the annual GDP of Japan.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Put another way, that extra output from an extra 0.4 percentage points of real growth each year, summed over a decade, would be the equivalent of $36,000 per household, again in 2019 dollars.&nbsp; So, differences of a mere tenths of a percentage points to economic growth can gradually add up to be the size of whole nations’ economies.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, there, Jim Tankersley with the New York Times. Thanks so much for doing this.&nbsp; Racial equity has been a big focus of the President, but there is not a racial equity breakout in this budget.&nbsp; Why?</p>



<p>ACTING DIRECTOR YOUNG:&nbsp; So thank you for that.&nbsp; I &#8212; you know, I think one way to accomplish things like racial equity, which is important &#8212; as you&#8217;ve pointed out, the President is taking historic action &#8212; is to ensure that we&#8217;re looking at implementing all of our programs with that in mind.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, we have built that in.&nbsp; We have given clear direction to our agencies that they are to use that lens as they implement these programs.&nbsp; You know, we can&#8217;t wait on this, and this is why we have given clear instructions to agencies, with resources they have now, that they should be looking at racial equity with everything that they do.&nbsp; This is not something we should have to call out; this is something that should be pervasive in how the government does its business.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So you &#8212; you may not see a line item, but I think that’s more than appropriate with the way the President has asked his government to address these long, pervasive issues.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey, guys.&nbsp; It&#8217;s Justin Sink from Bloomberg.&nbsp; I&#8217;m wondering &#8212; just to make sure I&#8217;m reading this correctly &#8212; if you see the entirety of the Trump tax cuts expiring at their end but in the middle of your 10-year budget cycle.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, you know, there&#8217;s been criticism that that would violate the President&#8217;s pledge not to raise taxes on those making under $400,000 a year.&nbsp; So how do you, kind of, grapple with that question?</p>



<p>ACTING DIRECTOR YOUNG:&nbsp; Hey, this is Shalanda.&nbsp; I&#8217;m happy to restate as many times as you allow me: The President has committed, continues to commit, will commit forever that individuals making under $400,000 a year will not have to pay a single dollar more in taxes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The tax expiration issue that you brought up doesn&#8217;t happen until 2025.&nbsp; The President will use the time between now and that expiration in 2025 to work with Congress to continue reforming our tax code so that it can ask the wealthy to pay their fair share, raising the right amount of revenue, and protect the low- and middle-income families.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, you know, absolutely we are tracking this, but what &#8212; the issue you raise is an issue in 2025, and this is a 2022 budget.&nbsp; And so, we are certainly aware and we&#8217;ll ensure that Congress keeps to the President&#8217;s pledge that we not raise taxes on those under $400,000.</p>



<p>MR. FRIEDLANDER:&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; And, Moderator, we have time for one more question.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, this is Ben Popken with NBC News.&nbsp; So prices are rising and &#8212; does the budget anticipates that wage growth will outpace rising inflation, deterioration of consumer purchasing power, especially for lower-income households.&nbsp; And is there a time period before that becomes true?&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>CHAIR ROUSE:&nbsp; So the budget does &#8212; the budget certainly does project that there&#8217;s going to be some short-term inflation, although we do expect it to settle back down to about 2 percent at an annual rate.</p>



<p>You know, we anticipate that the &#8212; that because of these policies, we&#8217;re going to have some GDP growth, which will be benefiting all Americans.&nbsp; We know that when you reach full employment &#8212; which we also anticipate that through these policies we’ll reach full employment &#8212; that that benefits all, as the President outlined and la- &#8212; leaned into in his speech yesterday.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so we &#8212; we expect that everybody will benefit and that the economy will benefit from the productivity-enhancing investments that are embedded in this budget, funded from the revenue that would be largely from the wealthiest Americans to help pay for these investments.</p>



<p>MR. FRIEDLANDER:&nbsp; Great, thank you so much.&nbsp; And thanks, all of you, for joining us on a Friday.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A reminder that the contents of this call are on the record and embargoed until 1:30 p.m. Eastern time today.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And with that, hope you all have a great weekend.&nbsp; Thanks so much.</p>

<p>In the last weeks, our nation has seen a series of anti-Semitic attacks, targeting and terrorizing American Jews.</p>



<p>We have seen a brick thrown through window of a Jewish-owned business in Manhattan, a swastika carved into the door of a synagogue in Salt Lake City, families threatened outside a restaurant in Los Angeles, and museums in Florida and Alaska, dedicated to celebrating Jewish life and culture and remembering the Holocaust, vandalized with anti-Jewish messages.</p>



<p>These attacks are despicable, unconscionable, un-American, and they must stop.</p>



<p>I will not allow our fellow Americans to be intimidated or attacked because of who they are or the faith they practice.</p>



<p>We cannot allow the toxic combination of hatred, dangerous lies, and conspiracy theories to put our fellow Americans at risk.</p>



<p>As Attorney General Garland announced yesterday, the Department of Justice will be deploying all of the tools at its disposal to combat hate crimes.</p>



<p>In recent days, we have seen that no community is immune. We must all stand together to silence these terrible and terrifying echoes of the worst chapters in world history, and pledge to give hate no safe harbor.</p>



<p>May is Jewish American Heritage Month, when we honor Jewish Americans who have inextricably woven their experience and their accomplishments into the fabric of our national identity; overcoming the pain of history, and helping lead our struggle for a more fair, just, and tolerant society.</p>



<p>Let us all take up that work and create a nation that stands for, and stands up for, the dignity and safety of all of our people.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Sportrock Climbing Center<br>Alexandria, Virginia</p>



<p>12:02 P.M. EDT</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know about you all, but following a governor, introducing the President in front of about half the legislature and the national press when I was junior in high school &#8212; no, it wouldn&#8217;t be close.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; I just want you to remember me when you&#8217;re President.&nbsp; When I go by, don&#8217;t say, &#8220;Joe, who?&#8221;&nbsp; Okay?&nbsp; Promise me?&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before I begin, I&#8217;d like to say a quick word about an old friend of mine &#8212; a quick word about Senator John Warner.&nbsp; I had the privilege of serving with John for three decades in the United States Senate.&nbsp; And I can say, without hesitation, he was a man of conscience and a man of honor.&nbsp; And in his life full of honors, the most enduring was his service to the people of Virginia.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re going to miss him dearly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, you know, John took chances.&nbsp; I was stunned &#8212; pleased and stunned when, in the middle of my primary, John endorsed me for President of the United States.&nbsp; It was how things sort of used to be back in the old days in the United States when I first got there.&nbsp; People &#8212; that wouldn&#8217;t &#8212; didn&#8217;t happen that often, but people would cross the aisle to work with one another. &nbsp;</p>



<p>John was a man of great integrity, and &#8212; and he&#8217;s missed &#8212; going to be missed.&nbsp; And Virginia was just fortunate to have him as long as they did.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, Jacob, I want to thank you for sharing your story.&nbsp; And I want to &#8212; you pointed out that my wife works for the governor.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; No wonder she doesn&#8217;t pay attention to me when I&#8217;m in &#8212; around the governor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But all kidding aside, I&#8217;m very proud of the fact that Jill has &#8212; teaching is not what Jill does; teaching is who she is.&nbsp; And she&#8217;s done it her &#8212; her whole adult life, and she&#8217;s still doing it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I know some people said, &#8220;When you&#8217;re First Lady, are you going to continue to teach?&#8221;&nbsp; She said, &#8220;Yes,&#8221; but I don&#8217;t think she bargained for having to teach online initially.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; You know, I &#8212; students &#8212; I watched her.&nbsp; She spent more time &#8212; four hours a day for about a month &#8212; learning how to teach online.&nbsp; So don&#8217;t feel bad about you all having to do it too.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; I watch the teachers have to do it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Any rate &#8212; and I just want to say that, you know, we&#8217;re in a position now &#8212; Governor Northam, I want to thank you for your welcome to the Commonwealth.&nbsp; And I want to thank you for all you&#8217;re doing to help win the fight against COVID.&nbsp; You&#8217;re one of the best governors in the country in taking this on, and you did it from the beginning.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>And, Mayor Wilson, thanks for the passport into the city.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; I promise I&#8217;ll leave in time, but thank you.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>And Congressman Connolly and Beyer, they are both members of Congress but Congressman Connolly got to the Congress with a real impediment.&nbsp; He worked for me for years before that on my staff.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; And everything has gone downhill since you left, Gerald.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; But thank you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I want to thank the Speaker as well and the Senate Majority Leader, as well as thank all of you working so hard for the people here in Northern Virginia.</p>



<p>Four months after I took office, we&#8217;re further along in this fight than anyone thought possible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s remember where we were 129 days ago: When I took office, we were averaging 184,000 cases per day nationwide.&nbsp; Here in Virginia, as the governor pointed out, schools were closed.&nbsp; Main Street had gone quiet here and in cities all across America.&nbsp; Virginia Tech, didn&#8217;t play in a bowl game this winter &#8212; first time in 28 years.&nbsp; And so many joys of life, large and small, had been halted by a long, dark winter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, today, we&#8217;ve gone from 184 [thousand] cases per day nationwide to fewer than 22 cases &#8212; 22,000 cases per day.&nbsp; Deaths have dropped by over 85 percent.&nbsp; Tens of thousands of moms and dads, grandpops and grandmoms, brothers, sisters, neighbors, friends are still with us today who would otherwise have been lost.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This has been true here in Virginia particularly.&nbsp; From 43,000 cases the week before I took office to fewer than 2,800 in the past week &#8212; a 93 percent decline.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve been able to do it for three reasons.&nbsp; First, we planned and executed a vaccination effort at a scale and speed never before seen here or anywhere in the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here in Virginia, that meant $247 million in federal funding for community vaccinations sites; over 360 federally funded National Guard members supporting this state&#8217;s COVID-19 response; getting doses to community healthcare centers, a thousand pharmacies all across Virginia; and creating a mass vaccination site in Norfolk initially run by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the United States Navy in partnership with Virginia.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The second reason that we succeeded is: Governors, like Governor Northam, have been instrumental partners.&nbsp; Leaders in red states and blue states working with businesses, faith leaders, community groups to get it done at a local level.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And thirdly and most crucially, the American people.&nbsp; More than 165 million Americans so far have done their patriotic duty; 165 million have gotten at least one shot.&nbsp; Americans of every party, every race, and creed have come together and rolled up their sleeves, literally, and done their part.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now 51 percent of American adults have been fully vaccinated.&nbsp; Seventy-five percent of seniors are fully vac- &#8212; vaccinated, leaving nobody behind: Black, white, Hispanic.&nbsp; Across the world &#8212; across the board, they’ve been getting their vaccinations.</p>



<p>In Virginia, 55 percent &#8212; as the Governor said &#8212; of all adults are vaccinated.&nbsp; I believe that’s the right number, Gov.&nbsp; And look at what that means: We aren’t just saving lives; we’re getting our lives back.&nbsp; Stores and restaurants up and down Main Street are hanging “open” signs on their front doors.</p>



<p>And here, in a rock-climbing gym, we’re greeted by another &#8212; and we’re greeting one another with smiles, with our masks off.&nbsp; And I&#8217;m about to do this 60-foot wall but you &#8212; (laughter).</p>



<p>I’ll tell you what: I work out every morning, but I said, “I &#8212; I have trouble holding those grips there.”&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; And the young man said to me &#8212; he said, “The way to work your hands…” &#8212; he said, “get a kettlebell, a light one, and just put it under your fingers and work it that way.”&nbsp; Tonight, I&#8217;m trying.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>But, folks, look, in Norfolk and Fredericksburg, fans are &#8212; are heading back to the Minor League ballparks, pools and parks are opening up across the state, families are heading down to spend Memorial Day weekend in Virginia Beach.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And all over the country, we’ve gone from pain and stagnation of a long, dark winter to an economy on the move, growing faster than it has in nearly 40 years.&nbsp; From anemic job creation in the months before I took office, to the fastest job creation in the first three months of any administration in American history and rising wages.&nbsp; Rising wages.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>As more Americans get vaccinated, the days grow brighter and brighter.&nbsp; But let me be clear: We’re not done yet.&nbsp; We have to reach those who are not vaccinated and make it as easy as possible for them to get protected.</p>



<p>I set an ambitious goal of getting 70 percent of adult Americans at least one shot by July the 4th.&nbsp; Today, just over a month to go, we’re at 62 percent.&nbsp; Ten states have already reached the 70 percent milestone.&nbsp; Virginia is at 66; it’s moving closer every day.</p>



<p>And continuing on all &#8212; counting on &#8212; on just all the help and continuing this process is really &#8212; I think you&#8217;re going to get the job done here in Virginia pretty quickly, Gov.</p>



<p>To hit 70 percent and keep sprinting through the finish line is what we’re all about.&nbsp; If we succeed, we can celebrate our independence from the virus together on the Fourth of July as we celebrate our independence as a nation.&nbsp; And the future is only going to get brighter because there will be no doubt what America can achieve when we do it together.</p>



<p>I know when I ran for office I said I wanted to do three things, one of which was to unite the country.&nbsp; It’s difficult, but this is the first real evidence that we’re able to do it.&nbsp; The American people are more ready to come together, I believe, than the Congress and the elected officials are, but we’re getting there.</p>



<p>If you aren’t vaccinated yet, it’s never been easier.&nbsp; If convenience is the issue, there are 80,000 locations.&nbsp; Visit Vaccines.gov or text your ZIP Code to 438829 and you’ll find the sites nearest you; it will pop up immediately.&nbsp; And in almost all cases, you don’t need an appointment.</p>



<p>If transportation is an issue &#8212; I want to thank Lyft and Uber.&nbsp; They’ve come forward and they’ve offered free rides to and from vaccination sites through the July 4th.&nbsp; So anybody who says they can&#8217;t get there, call Lyft or Uber.&nbsp; They&#8217;re doing a patriotic thing.&nbsp; They’ll come and pick you up, take you to the vaccination center, get you, wait for you, and take you back to your home or wherever you emerged from.</p>



<p>And, you know, if cost is an issue, don’t let &#8212; don’t be concerned; the vaccine is 100 percent free.&nbsp; And if time is an issue, there are 10,000 [tens of thousands] sites offering vaccinations without an appointment &#8212; 1,000 pharmacies in Virginia alone.&nbsp; And the vast majority offer no appointment &#8212; with no appointment required.</p>



<p>We’ve made extraordinary progress.&nbsp; Every American should be proud of what we’ve accomplished, and we did it together.&nbsp; But we still have five weeks left to hit our goal.&nbsp; You know, we &#8212; and I know we can do it.&nbsp; Just look at what we’ve done so far.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There’s not a single thing &#8212; and I&#8217;ve been saying this a long time &#8212; and I think a lot of the press, they&#8217;re smart as the devil, think I&#8217;m being naïve &#8212; there&#8217;s nothing we cannot accomplish if we do it together.&nbsp; I really believe that.&nbsp; Nothing.&nbsp; Nothing.&nbsp; Nothing we&#8217;ve ever set our mind to as Americans that we&#8217;ve failed at when we&#8217;ve done it together.&nbsp; And, Virginia, you know you’re doing your part.</p>



<p>So, you know, I remember I always would hear the &#8212; in the last administration, I&#8217;d hear when they&#8217;d talk about vaccines and that, “We&#8217;re going to &#8212; and we&#8217;re going to make great &#8212; great progress.”&nbsp; And they’d say, “There&#8217;s light at the end of the tunnel.” &nbsp;I was reminded of my generation in the ’60s.&nbsp; There was a very raunchy comedian who’d say, “Yeah, there&#8217;s light…” &#8212; when he&#8217;s talking about the Vietnam War.&nbsp; He said, “Yeah, there&#8217;s light at the end of the tunnel.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a freight train.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Well, this time there&#8217;s sunlight at the end of the tunnel.&nbsp; There&#8217;s real light.&nbsp; There&#8217;s real light.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, Gov &#8212; I really mean this; I&#8217;m not being political &#8212; you&#8217;ve done one hell of a job, Doc.&nbsp; You&#8217;ve done a hell of a job and it matters.&nbsp; It matters.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So I want to thank you all.&nbsp; God bless you.&nbsp; God protect our troops.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On Memorial Day, we honor and reflect upon the courage, integrity, and selfless dedication of the members of our Armed&nbsp;Forces who have made the greatest sacrifice in service to&nbsp;our Nation.&nbsp; Whether in the waters of the Pacific, on the beachheads of Europe, in the deserts of the Middle East, or in&nbsp;the mountains of Afghanistan, American service members have given their lives to uphold our Constitution and to defend the safety and freedoms of our citizens.&nbsp; These patriots embody the best of the American spirit. They put themselves on the line for our shared values &#8212; for duty, honor, country &#8212; and they paid the ultimate price. &nbsp;Our Nation can never fully repay the debt we owe to our fallen heroes and their families.</p>



<p>Jill and I know what it means to have a child serving in a&nbsp;war zone &#8212; the ever-present concern for your loved one and their fellow service members. &nbsp;Today and every day, we ask God to protect our troops. &nbsp;We also recognize the tremendous loss endured by America&#8217;s Gold Star families &#8212; the families of military members who died in conflict. &nbsp;We have a sacred obligation as a Nation to support those families and to always honor the memories of their loved ones.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That is the vow we make each year on Memorial Day. &nbsp;Our Nation will never forget the courage and patriotism demonstrated by the countless women and men who laid down their lives so that we may continue to pursue a more perfect Union and to protect the unalienable rights Americans hold dear.&nbsp; They came from every part of the country, of every background and belief, united by a shared belief in our uniquely American creed &#8212; that&nbsp;all people are created equal. &nbsp;We will honor their legacy by continuing our work to live up to that commitment and to advance the values they lived and died to defend.&nbsp; We will continue to fight for equity and inclusion in our country and institutions, and ensure every qualified American who is willing to serve our country &#8212; regardless of race, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, or background &#8212; has a fair and equal opportunity to do so.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We will continue to honor our fallen service members through the actions of a new generation who volunteer to serve in uniform, who anchor our military to our democratic values, and who stand ready to deter aggression from our enemies and, if&nbsp;required, fight and defend our Nation. &nbsp;Today &#8212; as we keep true to the memory of our fallen heroes &#8212; we will endeavor to meet their legacy and once more lead the world through the power of our example and not just the example of our power.</p>



<p>As our Nation&#8217;s service members continue to risk their lives to protect our homeland and thwart our enemies, we must not lose sight of our desire for enduring peace.&nbsp; Every day, countless Americans pray and work for peace so that we may one day live in a world where American patriots need not make the ultimate sacrifice, and where all people live in freedom and prosperity.&nbsp; As a Nation, we are grateful to the brave members of our Armed Services &#8212; both past and present &#8212; who have forged the legacy for that possibility.</p>



<p>In honor and recognition of all of our fallen service members, the Congress, by a joint resolution approved May 11, 1950, as amended (36 U.S.C. 116), has requested that the President issue a proclamation calling on the people of the United States to observe each Memorial Day as a day of prayer for permanent peace and designating a period on that day when the people of the United States might unite in prayer and reflection. &nbsp;The Congress, by Public Law 106-579, has also designated 3:00 p.m.&nbsp;local time on that day as a time for all Americans to observe, in their own way, the National Moment of Remembrance.</p>



<p>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim Memorial Day, May&nbsp;31, 2021, as a day of prayer for permanent peace, and I&nbsp;designate the hour beginning in each locality at 11:00 a.m.&nbsp;of&nbsp;that day as a time when people might unite in prayer and&nbsp;reflection. &nbsp;I urge the press, radio, television, and all other information media to cooperate in this observance.&nbsp; I further ask all Americans to observe the National Moment of Remembrance beginning at 3:00&nbsp;p.m. local time on Memorial Day.</p>



<p>I request the Governors of the United States and its Territories, and the appropriate officials of all units of government, to direct that the flag be flown at half-staff until noon on this Memorial Day on all buildings, grounds, and naval vessels throughout the United States and in all areas under its jurisdiction and control. &nbsp;I also request the people of the United States to display the flag at half-staff from their homes for the customary forenoon period.</p>



<p>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-eighth day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-fifth.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-right">JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.</p>
