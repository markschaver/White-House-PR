<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Atlantic City Convention Center<br><em>Atlantic City, New Jersey</em></em></p>



<p>11:54 A.M. EDT<br>&nbsp;<br>THE VICE PRESIDENT: &nbsp;Good morning, everyone!&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Good morning!&nbsp; Good morning.&nbsp; Have a seat.&nbsp; Please, have a seat.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Oh, it is so good to be here with all my sisters and brothers.&nbsp; (Laughs.)<br>&nbsp;<br>Let me just thank Vice Chair Boykin-Towns for that incredible introduction.&nbsp; It means so much.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>My team was back there and said, my goodness, you know, over the years, we’ve &#8212; we’ve actually &#8212; we’ve done some things, and it’s nice to know that it is having the impact that it is having.&nbsp; So I want to thank you, Madam Vice Chair, for that introduction.&nbsp; It really means a lot.<br>&nbsp;<br>President Johnson, thank you for your years of dedicated partnership and leadership &#8212; (applause) &#8212; yes &#8212; on the issue of voting rights and so many more issues that challenge our nation and its people.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>I have worked with President Johnson over the years, where we have been in small rooms, where we have been in the Oval Office, where we have been in large rooms such as this.&nbsp; He is the same person wherever he is.&nbsp; And he is a person who is always fighting for the people and the best of who we can be as a nation.&nbsp; And I admire and respect the hard work and determination that you put into this most important position as the president of our NAACP.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br>&nbsp;<br>So, to the Board of Directors, chapter presidents, ACT-SO and Next Gen leaders, and the entire NAACP membership; to Secretary Marcia Fudge, who was with us today &#8212; (applause) &#8212; to my pastor, Reverend Dr. Amos C. Brown; to all of you: Greetings.&nbsp; Greetings.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>I just want to, if you don’t mind for a moment, take a moment of personal privilege to talk about Dr. Brown.&nbsp; He has been on this journey with me every step of the way, from when I first thought about running for public office almost two decades ago.&nbsp; And he has been such a voice of leadership, more leadership, and leadership in our nation.&nbsp; And so I want to thank you, Dr. Brown, for all that you are &#8212; all that you are.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br>&nbsp;<br>So, as many of you know, I am a proud lifetime member of this organization.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; (Laughs.)&nbsp; And I have had the distinct pleasure of addressing this conference many times over the years.&nbsp; And I am honored today to address you for the first time as Vice President of the United States.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And I stand today on the shoulders of the legendary lawyers of this organization &#8212; Thurgood Marshall, Charles Hamilton Houston, Constance Baker Motley &#8212; who were, of course, among the greatest heroes of the Civil Rights Movement.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Just last March, I stood in the Rose Garden, at the White House, with Ms. Michelle Duster, the great-granddaughter of a founder of the NAACP and one of our nation&#8217;s greatest journalists, Ida B. Wells.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And we were there to address some very unfinished business &#8212; business of this organization &#8212; which was to watch President Joe Biden sign the Emmett Till Antilynching Act.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; I was proud to introduce that act when I served in the United States Senate, along with Senator Cory Booker &#8212; New Jersey’s own &#8212; (applause) &#8212; and Congressman Bobby Rush, who I think is here but has been a great leader over the years.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>This legislation was a result of years of determined action by civil rights organizations, including the NAACP.&nbsp; Even though it took a staggering 122 years to finally make lynching a federal crime but, it must be said, even though it took that long, the NAACP was never deterred and always determined.<br>&nbsp;<br>Core to the identity of this organization is the unwavering commitment to move our nation forward no matter how long it might take.&nbsp; For more than a century, the NAACP has fought to ensure the wellbeing of Black communities and, by extension, all communities in our country.&nbsp; This organization has fought to secure, for all people, the rights guaranteed in our nation&#8217;s Constitution, driven by the ability to see America as it can be, unburdened by what has been.<br>&nbsp;<br>This organization and the people who make up this organization &#8212; will we see a nation in which the promise of opportunity, of justice, of freedom can be made real for all people?<br>&nbsp;<br>And I bring you greetings from our President, Joe Biden, who wants &#8212; (applause) &#8212; to make clear that he and I, of course, share in the vision of the NAACP.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>You see, we see and are prepared to address the disparities that are holding so many people back in our nation &#8212; disparities that we see in education, in economic opportunity, in housing, healthcare, and more.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>To address those disparities and to advance the fight for civil rights, President Biden and I have put equity at the center of all that we do.&nbsp; And that begins with our children.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The great Thurgood Marshall once said that every child has a right &#8212; I will now quote &#8212; &#8220;to an equal start in life and an equal opportunity to reach their potential.&#8221;&nbsp; I believe, to move our nation forward, we must fight to make sure all of the children of our community have that equal opportunity of which he spoke.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And that is why together, all of us here, fought to extend the Child Tax Credit, which lifted nearly 40 percent of Black children out of poverty last year alone.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>It is why we passed a tax cut to give working families up to $8,000 a year to give folks more room in their budgets to buy for their children food, medication, and school supplies.<br>&nbsp;<br>It is why we are fighting to make sure home healthcare is accessible and affordable.&nbsp; Because we all know we have far too many children, for example, in our communities who have disabilities and their parents need support.&nbsp; They need help.&nbsp; And so, this is the work we are doing.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And finally, because we know that when we invest in the education of our children, we are really investing in the future of our nation.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>That is why, as Madam Vice Chair mentioned, we invested an historic 5.8 billion &#8212; that’s with a “B” &#8212; billion dollars in our HBCUs so they will remain the center of academic excellence.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Leaders of the NAACP: To move our nation forward, we must also &#8212; as has been discussed &#8212; make sure that our mothers, our daughters, our sisters, and our aunties have the healthcare that they need to thrive.&nbsp; And that is why we are leading the fight to address the maternal health crisis.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Today, in America, Black women are three times as likely to die from pregnancy-related causes.&nbsp; Native American women are more than twice as likely to die.&nbsp; Rural women are more than one and a half times more likely to die.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So we have elevated, for an obvious reason, the issue of maternal health so it will be a national priority.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And building on the work that we have done together over the years, for the first time I was proud to convene women from around the country at the White House to discuss this critical issue.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And we took action then, because it can’t just be about words, to provide resources to hire and train doulas, to advance culturally competent care &#8212; (applause) &#8212; and to research the contributors to maternal mortality, because included in those contributors are racial bias in the healthcare delivery system; included in those contributors are the stressors that Black women face in life.&nbsp; And we need to research and make clear and speak honestly about all of those issues, again, as a national priority.<br>&nbsp;<br>In addition, we worked with states to expand Medicaid postpartum, because the way it had been working, Medicaid was covering two months postpartum.&nbsp; Now, she just gave birth to a human being.&nbsp; So we are now extending and working with states that it will be expanded to 12 months of postpartum care.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; And that will benefit over a quarter million women.<br>&nbsp;<br>Leaders of the NAACP: To continue to move our nation forward, we must also take action to address the economic inequities that are holding back so many people in our nation, which is why, together, we are fighting to build more opportunity for wealth in our communities.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>For example, we are investing billions of dollars in minority and women entrepreneurs.&nbsp; We are &#8212; (applause) &#8212; we are addressing systemic inequities in homeownership, which, of course, is an issue this organization has been fighting for, for years, as integral to the Civil Rights Movement.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And as you know, it is because of a clear history of segregation, restrictive covenants, and redlining that long denied Black homeowners the opportunity to take full advantage of the wealth-building power of homeownership.&nbsp; That inequity continues today in the home appraisal system.<br>&nbsp;<br>So, I am proud that our administration, led by Secretary Marcia Fudge &#8212; (applause) &#8212; is working to eliminate racial bias in home appraisals so that Black and Latino families can fully realize the true value of their homes and pass that value to their children and grandchildren.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br>&nbsp;<br>Homeownership is one of the greatest sources in the community of intergenerational wealth.&nbsp; However, we know that, still, in this ongoing fight for civil rights on housing, that we are hearing the cases of, for example, a Black family trying to sell their home, and they get the appraisal and they just know it is not the true value of their home.&nbsp; And so you&#8217;ve heard the stories about how they&#8217;ll then encourage friends of the family &#8212; a white family &#8212; to come in.&nbsp; And then the white family will put the pictures up of their family.&nbsp; And then that appraisal gets done, and it&#8217;s for a much higher value.&nbsp; Same house.&nbsp; Same neighborhood.<br>&nbsp;<br>So this is a real issue.&nbsp; And with the leadership of Marcia Fudge, we are dealing with that.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And finally, we know that to protect this progress &#8212; the progress we have achieved so far &#8212; and to ensure justice for all, we must have better representation on our federal courts.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And with your support, I am proud to say that our administration has appointed the most diverse group of judges in the history of the United States &#8212; (applause) &#8212; including a woman who I have come to know and admire, who is the first Black woman appointed to the United States Supreme Court: Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; We got to stand for that one.<br>&nbsp;<br>So, leaders of the NAACP, together we have fought hard to move our nation forward.&nbsp; And yet, we must recognize there are those who are fighting to drag us backward: extremist, so-called leaders, who are attempting to undermine our democracy and assault our most fundamental freedoms &#8212; the freedom to be safe from gun violence, the freedom to make decisions about our own bodies, and the freedom to vote.&nbsp; So I will address them in turn.<br>&nbsp;<br>First, the freedom from gun violence.&nbsp; So, recently, I visited Buffalo, New York, to attend the funeral of an 86-year-old grandmother who went to the grocery store after, as she often did, spending the day with her husband who was in a nursing home &#8212; Mrs. Whitfield.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>I went to Highland Park, Illinois, where there were strollers and lawn chairs scattered up and down a street where there was supposed to be a parade for July 4th.&nbsp; There &#8212; as in Uvalde, Texas; as in Greenwood, Indiana, just last night; and in so many communities across our nation &#8212; scenes of ordinary life have been turned into war zones by horrific acts of gun violence.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Mass shootings have made America a nation in mourning.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s not only the mass shootings.&nbsp; We see it in our communities every day, and it is no less tragic or outrageous.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Think about it: Black people are 13 percent of America&#8217;s population but make up 62 percent of gun homicide victims.&nbsp; This issue of the need for reasonable gun safety laws is a real issue when we are talking about the civil right, the right that all communities should have, to live in a place that is safe without weapons of war running those streets.<br>&nbsp;<br>And understand: The number of guns manufactured in this country tripled over the last 20 years.&nbsp; Today we have more guns in our nation than people.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So, earlier this month, the President signed the first federal gun safety law in nearly 30 years.&nbsp; And it was an important and necessary step.&nbsp; But we need to do more.&nbsp; We must repeal the liability shield that protects gun manufacturers.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; And we must renew the assault weapons ban.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br>&nbsp;<br>You know, an assault weapon, like many things, there’s a design &#8212; there’s a purposeful design.&nbsp; Well, for the assault weapon, the design is to kill a lot of human beings quickly.&nbsp; There is no reason for weapons of war on the streets of America.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>We must also take steps to protect other fundamental freedoms, including the freedom for a woman to make decisions about her own body.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>And, you know, on this subject, it’s important to note that to support a woman’s ability &#8212; not her government, but her &#8212; to make that decision does not require anyone to abandon their faith or their beliefs.&nbsp; It just requires us to agree the government shouldn’t be making that decision for her.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>And think about it: For the first time in generations, the United States Supreme Court &#8212; the highest court of our land; the former court of Thurgood Marshall &#8212; took away a constitutional right, that had been recognized, from the people of America, from the women of America.<br><br>We know, NAACP, that our country has a history of claiming ownership over human bodies.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; And today, extremists, so-called leaders are criminalizing doctors and punishing women for making healthcare decisions for themselves &#8212; personal decisions that it is her right to make in consultation with her doctor, her pastor, her priest, her rabbi, her loved ones, not her government telling her what to do.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>And these so-called leaders &#8212; so-called &#8212; claim that, “Well, you know, we just think that this is a decision that should be made by the folks in the states.&nbsp; People in the states can vote on this.”&nbsp; Right?&nbsp; But at this moment, many of those same so-called leaders are the same ones who are passing laws to restrict the ability of people to vote.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>Laws &#8212; they’re passing laws, the same people &#8212; laws that ban drop boxes and restrict early voting; laws that make it illegal to give people food and water for waiting in line to vote.&nbsp; Undemocratic laws.&nbsp; Un-American laws.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br>&nbsp;<br>You know, I asked my team to &#8212; you know, I &#8212; remember Venn diagrams?&nbsp; Those three circles.&nbsp; Right?&nbsp; And then let’s just see where they overlap.<br><br>So I asked my team &#8212; I said, you know, “Do a Venn diagram on two circles for me and, in particular, the overlap of states that are attacking the freedom to vote and attacking women&#8217;s freedoms over their own bodies.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are 10 states that are doing both.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Here&#8217;s the point: Our freedoms are all connected.&nbsp; Consider the freedom to vote.&nbsp; The freedom to vote is the freedom that unlocks all others.&nbsp; Is &#8212; it is a catalyst for economic justice, for social justice, for racial justice.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; And generations of leaders gave their sweat, their tears, their blood in its defense.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>You know, earlier this year, many of us were together in Selma, Alabama &#8212; as we have been before &#8212; this year to commemorate the 57th anniversary of Bloody Sunday.&nbsp; Standing there, shoulder-to-shoulder with leaders who return to the Edmund Pettus Bridge every year, it was clear: While we will honor the history of the movement, we must recognize the dream of the movement remains unfinished.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So, no matter how many times they push us back, we will continue to march forward.&nbsp; And we will pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and the Freedom to Vote Act.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Friends: Freedom, liberty, and democracy are on the ballot this fall.&nbsp; And we need to make sure that our voices are heard.&nbsp; There is a midterm coming up in about &#8212; I think it’s 113 days, maybe 112 days &#8212; 112 days.&nbsp; We’re not going to be able to get these days back, so each one of these days we must, with a sense of urgency, ensure that the American people know their voi- &#8212; their vote matters.&nbsp; It is their voice; that the right to vote is something that the leaders of this organization and its founders knew to be at the core of all of the other rights and freedoms to which we are entitled.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So, we know what we need to do.&nbsp; And, in particular, to protect the freedom to vote and a women’s right to make decisions about her own body, we need people who will defend our rights up and down the ballot, from district attorneys to state attorneys general, from local sheriffs to governors.<br>&nbsp;<br>And we need two more votes in the United States Senate.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br>&nbsp;<br>We will not &#8212; and the President has been clear &#8212; we will not let the filibuster stand in our way of our most essential rights and freedoms.<br>&nbsp;<br>So, leaders of the NAACP: Together, we have accomplished much, but we still have much to do.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>To move our nation forward, President Biden and I ask for you to do what you have always done: continue to build coalitions of Americans of all ages and races and backgrounds; continue to do so with the knowledge that we have so much more in common than what separates us; continue to activate and organize communities in every state; continue to use your power to sh- &#8212; to fight for our shared vision of America.<br>&nbsp;<br>And as I often will refer to her, the great Coretta Scott King &#8212; who joined the NAACP as a young college student &#8212; once said that freedom must be earned and won in each and every generation.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Today &#8212; and I look at the young leaders here in particular &#8212; (applause) &#8212; yes.&nbsp; Today, it is our collective turn, but we’re counting on you all, because today we have been called to create a more fair, more equal, and more just America.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So, today, let us recommit to answering the call.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>God bless you.&nbsp;&nbsp; And God bless the United States of America.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; END&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12:22 P.M. EDT<br>&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>On Tuesday, July 19, 2022, National Cyber Director Chris Inglis will convene a National Cyber Workforce and Education Summit at the White House with Secretary of Commerce Gina M. Raimondo; Secretary of Labor Martin J. Walsh; Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro N. Mayorkas; Ambassador Susan E. Rice, Director of the Domestic Policy Council; Under Secretary of Education James Kvaal; Director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Jen Easterly; Anne Neuberger, Deputy Assistant to the President and Deputy National Security Advisor for Cyber and Emerging Technology on the National Security Council; other senior representatives from the Federal Government; private sector executives; and thought leaders from across the cyber community and academia.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With approximately 700,000 cybersecurity positions open, America faces a national security challenge that must be tackled aggressively. During the Summit, participants will help chart a path toward a more secure future in which all Americans have the opportunity to raise the bar on cybersecurity through greater awareness, education, and training. The Summit will also serve as a call to action – to ensure that all Americans can capitalize on the benefits of the digital domain and to ensure that our Nation carries through on the positive opportunities ahead of us.</p>



<p>At the Summit, participants will discuss:</p>



<ul><li>The need to create and prioritize new skills-based pathways to cybersecurity jobs, including at community colleges, through Registered Apprenticeships, and via non-traditional training opportunities for Americans who can help defend our country and make a good living for themselves and their families. Training models such as Registered Apprenticeships can allow career seekers to earn and learn at the same time while often obtaining college credit, degrees, and a nationally recognized credential.</li><li>How in filling these open cybersecurity positions, the United States has an opportunity to build pipelines for historically untapped talent, including underserved and diverse communities, to reach jobs that often pay well and do not require a four-year degree.</li><li>And how investing in cyber training and education will: (1) enable Americans who comprise the lifeblood of our economy – including those building the next generation of our Nation’s infrastructure – to be successful in our digital economy; and (2) empower society to harness cyber capabilities to achieve our individual and collective aspirations.</li></ul>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em><em>Biden Administration will facilitate air shipment of 802,446 8-ounce bottle equivalents of Nestlé Health Science <a>Alfamino</a></em>® <em>Infant and  Alfamino</em>®<em> Junior formula on July 21 and 22</em></em></p>



<p>Today, President Biden is announcing that his Administration is sourcing two flights, facilitated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), for Operation Fly Formula to transport Nestlé Health Science amino acid-based formula from Switzerland to John F. Kennedy Airport in New York on July 21 and 22. This delivery will include approximately 74,403 pounds of Nestlé Health Science Alfamino® Infantand Alfamino® Junior formula, the equivalent of 802,446 8-ounce bottles. These products will be distributed primarily to hospitals and home health care providers.<br><br>In May, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced that the agency is exercising enforcement discretion so that Nestlé can export additional infant formula into the U.S. Nestlé will import both standard and specialty infant formulas including Nestlé NAN® SupremePro 1, Nestlé NAN® SupremePro 2, Nestlé NAN® EXPERTpro SensiPro Premium Instant Starter Formula, Nestlé Health Science Alfamino® Infant and Alfamino® Junior, Vitaflo PKU start™, Gerber® Good Start® Gentle and Gerber® Good Start® Extensive HA®. Over time Nestlé plans to bring approximately 42 million 8-ounce bottle equivalents into the U.S. market.<br><br>President Biden launched Operation Fly Formula to speed up the import of infant formula and start getting more formula to stores as soon as possible. Under Operation Fly Formula, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the General Services Administration (GSA), and the Department of Defense (DOD) are partnering to pick up overseas infant formula that meets U.S. health and safety standards, so it can get to store shelves, hospitals and home health care providers faster. By July 24, Operation Fly Formula will have transported more than 61 million 8-ounce bottle equivalents to the U.S.<br><br>In addition, the Biden Administration has taken a number of other important actions to ensure there is enough safe infant formula for families, including invoking the Defense Production Act, entering into a consent agreement between the FDA and Abbott Nutrition to reopen the company’s Sturgis facility, and issuing FDA guidance so that major formula manufacturers can safely import formula that is not currently being produced for the U.S. market. Details of our actions can be found at whitehouse.gov/formula.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>The public release of the first-ever <a href="https://www.state.gov/atrocity-prevention/">U.S. Strategy to Anticipate, Prevent, and Respond to Atrocities</a>, along with the 2022 Report to Congress Pursuant to Section 5 of the Elie Wiesel Genocide and Atrocities Prevention Act of 2018, reaffirms the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to atrocity prevention as a core national security commitment and core moral responsibility of the United States.  The mass violence against men, women, and children in Ukraine serves as a solemn reminder of the unspeakable human toll of these vicious acts and the traumatic consequences for communities for future generations.</p>



<p>While the Report takes stock of our efforts as a whole-of-government over the last year to respond to the world’s gravest crimes, the Strategy lays out a future vision of a comprehensive&nbsp;approach to atrocity prevention, coordinated through the White House-led Atrocity Prevention Task Force.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Strategy consolidates and further institutionalizes a U.S. governmental process to detect and respond to early warning signs of atrocities and broadens U.S. involvement to engage with our international partners and civil society, including through multilateral fora.&nbsp;&nbsp; It complements and builds upon the <a href="https://www.state.gov/stability-strategy/">U.S. Strategy to Prevent Conflict and Promote Stability</a> and the <a href="https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/WPS_Strategy_10_October2019.pdf">U.S Strategy on Women, Peace, and Security</a>.&nbsp; Through these guiding documents, we acknowledge the importance of these various efforts working together to reinforce stability and build sustainable peace.&nbsp; We also note the disproportionate impact of violence targeted at women and girls, including through the use of conflict-related sexual violence.&nbsp; And as we support efforts to hold perpetrators accountable, the Strategy enumerates several tools that the United States can bring to bear to recognize the loss and suffering of victims and survivors and to promote peace, reconciliation, and democracy, including by working with allies and partners.</p>



<p>Above all, the Report and Strategy highlight the imperative for our collective ability and will to foresee and prevent atrocities and other crimes.&nbsp; We call upon our partners to further prioritize atrocity prevention, dedicate resources and personnel for these efforts, and continue pursuing the goal of “Never Again.”</p>

<p>On Fox News Sunday, Jared Bernstein of the Council of Economic Advisers described the strong state of the labor market and our jobs recovery, while re-emphasizing that bringing down prices is the President’s top priority. As part of that, he encouraged bipartisan support for measures to make prescription drugs, one of the biggest costs Americans face, much more affordable. As he noted, Americans often pay two to three times as much for the same drugs as Europeans, and for years both parties including President Trump have claimed they are in favor of addressing this issue.</p>



<p>BERNSTEIN: &nbsp;So, you made what I think is a really important point here, which is that, yes, savings &#8212; elevated savings from the Rescue Plan and other measures are very much helping to support consumer spending, the real buffer in this time of elevated inflation. But you said that can&#8217;t go on forever, and you&#8217;re exactly right.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What you need in the backdrop is a strong labor market, because that&#8217;s where most people get their incomes from. We have the strongest labor market on record in history by many conventional metrics. Nine million jobs since this president got here.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There&#8217;s a lot of talk about all these economic headwinds. If you look at this tailwind of job growth, 375,000 jobs per month in the past three months.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, you made a point about wage growth. Wage growth is actually pretty strong in nominal terms, but inflation is so high. And that&#8217;s what the president&#8217;s agenda is all about. Helping families afford prescription drugs, lowering their health insurance premium, something that Congress &#8212; I’m looking at the Capitol of the window here &#8212; something that Congress needs to act on before the August recess, and I’m talking bipartisan.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You know, I have heard Republicans say for the many decades I’ve been here &#8212; they want to lower prescription drugs. President Trump talked about lowering prescription drug costs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We pay two to three times what people in other countries pay for the very same drugs. That is just an unconscionable tax on our seniors.</p>



<p>And we shouldn’t &#8212; not only does that help people&#8217;s bottom line in terms of affordability, it saves Medicare $100 billion over ten years. So we should do that tomorrow to answer your question on affordability.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>Today,&nbsp;President Biden met&nbsp;in Jeddah&nbsp;with&nbsp;the&nbsp;leaders&nbsp;of the Gulf Cooperation Council&nbsp;(GCC)&nbsp;– Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates – the Republic of Egypt,&nbsp;the Republic of Iraq, and the Kingdom of Jordan (together known as the GCC+3). Named the “Jeddah Security and Development Summit,” this was the first&nbsp;summit&nbsp;of its kind&nbsp;among these nine countries. Throughout, the leaders&nbsp;reaffirmed their commitment to a prosperous, peaceful, and integrated Middle East region, and in working together to address global challenges, such as confronting new diseases, ensuring food and energy security, and addressing the climate crisis through partnerships. &nbsp;</p>



<p>At the Summit,&nbsp;President Biden reiterated the importance the United States places on its decades-long strategic partnerships in the Middle East region, affirmed the United States’ enduring commitment to the security and territorial defense of U.S. partners, and recognized the region’s increasingly important role as a trade and technology&nbsp;crossroads between&nbsp;hemispheres. &nbsp;He also strongly affirmed the centrality of the Middle East region to the long-term security and prosperity of the United States and the American people.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>America’s Commitment to the Middle East Region&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>President Biden set forth five declaratory principles&nbsp;– partnership, deterrence, diplomacy, integration, and values –&nbsp;to guide&nbsp;U.S. engagement in the Middle East over the coming decades:</p>



<p>1.&nbsp;<strong>Partnerships</strong>:&nbsp;The&nbsp;United States&nbsp;will&nbsp;support and strengthen&nbsp;partnerships with countries that subscribe to the rules-based international order, and we will make sure those countries can defend themselves against foreign threats.</p>



<p>2.&nbsp;<strong>Deterrence:&nbsp;</strong>The&nbsp;United States&nbsp;will not allow foreign&nbsp;or regional powers to jeopardize freedom of navigation through the Middle East’s waterways, including the Strait of Hormuz and the Bab al Mandab,&nbsp;nor tolerate efforts by any country to dominate another – or the region – through military buildups, incursions, or threats.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>3.&nbsp;<strong>Diplomacy:&nbsp;</strong>The&nbsp;United States&nbsp;will not just aim to deter threats to regional stability, we will work to reduce tensions, de-escalate, and end conflicts wherever possible through diplomacy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>4.&nbsp;<strong>Integration:&nbsp;</strong>The United States&nbsp;will build political, economic, and security connections between U.S. partners wherever possible, while respecting each country’s sovereignty and independent choices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>5.&nbsp;<strong>Values:&nbsp;</strong>The United States will always promote human rights and the values enshrined in the UN Charter. &nbsp;</p>



<p>This address by President Biden frames U.S. engagement going forward in a manner that harnesses unique American capabilities, in concert with long-standing U.S. partners.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition, the leaders around the table agreed to:</p>



<p><strong>Ensure&nbsp;Food Security for the Middle East’s Most Vulnerable Populations</strong></p>



<p>&nbsp;President Biden announced the United States&nbsp;has committed $1 billion in new acute near to long term food security assistance for the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region.&nbsp;&nbsp;Recognizing that the impacts of and capacity to respond to global food insecurity are unevenly distributed across countries, leaders of the Gulf Cooperation Council underscored their commitment to supporting vulnerable populations in the MENA region through the&nbsp;Arab Coordination Group (ACG)’s recently-announced $10 billion food security package. &nbsp;Together, the United States and the GCC countries will leverage their collective assistance funds to address immediate humanitarian needs and disruptions, including guaranteeing full, safe, and unhindered humanitarian access to populations in need across the region.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;The United States, the GCC members, Egypt, Iraq, and Jordan signed the&nbsp;<em>Roadmap for Global Food Security – Call&nbsp;to Action</em>, which was unveiled in May 2022 at the Ministerial Meeting of the United Nations. &nbsp;At the GCC+3 Summit, leaders affirmed their collective commitment to act with urgency, at scale, and in concert to respond to the urgent food security and nutrition needs of millions of people in vulnerable situations the world. &nbsp;They committed to provide immediate humanitarian assistance, build resilience of those in vulnerable situations, near-to medium food security assistance to strengthen social protection and safety nets, and strengthen sustainable, resilient, and inclusive food systems in line with the objectives of the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its Sustainable Development Goals, and the objectives of the 2021 UN Food Systems Summit.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Enhance&nbsp;Strategic Investment Cooperation</strong></p>



<p>&nbsp;GCC&nbsp;partners plan&nbsp;to invest&nbsp;a total of&nbsp;$3 billion in projects that align with U.S. Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) goals to&nbsp;deliver quality, sustainable infrastructure that makes a difference in people’s lives around the world, strengthens and diversifies our supply chains, creates new opportunities for American workers and businesses, and advances our national security.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;The&nbsp;Partnership for Global Infrastructure&nbsp;and Investment, which the President and G7 leaders unveiled at the June 26, 2022, G7 Summit,&nbsp;will be executed across four priority pillars that will define the second half of the 21<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;century. &nbsp;This includes:</p>



<p>o&nbsp;Tackling the climate crisis and bolstering global energy security through investments in climate resilient infrastructure, transformational energy technologies, and developing clean energy supply chains across the full integrated lifecycle, from the responsible mining of metals and critical minerals; to low-emissions transportation and hard infrastructure; to investing in new global refining, processing, and battery manufacturing sites; to deploying proven, as well as innovative, scalable technologies in places that do not yet have access to clean energy.</p>



<p>o&nbsp;Developing, expanding, and deploying secure information and communications technology (ICT) networks and infrastructure to power economic growth and facilitate open digital societies—from working with trusted vendors to provide 5G and 6G digital connectivity, to supporting access to platforms and services that&nbsp;depend upon an open, interoperable, secure, and reliable internet and mobile networks with sound cybersecurity.</p>



<p>o&nbsp;Advancing gender equality and equity—from care infrastructure that increases opportunities for economic participation by women, to improved water and sanitation infrastructure that addresses gender gaps in unpaid work and time use – in order to boost the global economic recovery by ensuring that half the population is not forced to sit on the sidelines.</p>



<p>o&nbsp;Developing and upgrading the infrastructure of health systems and contributing to global health security through investments in patient-centered health services and the health workforce; vaccine and other essential medical product manufacturing; and disease surveillance and early warning systems, including safe and secure labs. Addressing the current pandemic and preventing and preparing for the next one is crucial to U.S. economic and national security.</p>



<p><strong>Improve&nbsp;Patient Care&nbsp;for Palestinians</strong></p>



<p>&nbsp;Following President Biden’s July 15 announcement of a U.S. contribution of $100 million for the East Jerusalem Hospital Network, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE pledged $25 million each for a matching total of $100 million. &nbsp;Our combined $200 million assistance package will help the East Jerusalem Hospital Network upgrade its infrastructure and improve patient care for thousands of Palestinians in the West Bank, East Jerusalem, and Gaza&nbsp;who rely on the network for life-saving treatment.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Further&nbsp;Iraq’s Energy Integration with the GCC and Jordan</strong></p>



<p>&nbsp;President Biden welcomed Iraq concluding&nbsp;agreements&nbsp;with Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Jordan&nbsp;to bring affordable energy to Iraq and diversify its supply and ensure energy resiliency to meet the growing needs of its people. &nbsp;The landmark agreement signed today between Iraq and the GCC Interconnection Authority (GCCIA) will link Iraq’s electricity grid to the grids in the GCC thereby providing the Iraqi people with new and diversified sources of electricity over the coming decade.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Address Global Economic Security&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>&nbsp;President Biden spoke with Middle East leaders about the&nbsp;importance of&nbsp;addressing&nbsp;current&nbsp;global energy&nbsp;insecurities&nbsp;and managing energy price pressures by ensuring a steadily increasing supply by producing countries through 2022 and 2023, including through increasing investments in refining capacity. &nbsp;President Biden&nbsp;welcomed the recent announcement by OPEC+ to increase supply over the course of July and August. &nbsp;President&nbsp;Biden&nbsp;anticipates&nbsp;additional supply increases over the coming months, depending on market conditions and analysis, including record-setting domestic production from the United States.</p>



<p><strong>Integrated Air and Martine Defense Cooperation</strong></p>



<p>&nbsp;President Biden affirmed the United States’ commitment to accelerate ongoing work with its&nbsp;allies&nbsp;and partners in the Middle East to integrate and enhance security cooperation. &nbsp;In particular, the United States is committed to advancing a more integrated and regionally-networked air and missile defense architecture and countering the proliferation of&nbsp;unmanned aerial systems and missiles to non-state actors that threaten the peace and security of the region.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;<a></a>President Biden also reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to&nbsp;preserving the free flow of commerce through strategic international waterways like the Bab al-Mandab and the Strait of Hormuz, through which 40 percent of the world’s energy passes every day,&nbsp;via&nbsp;multiple joint naval task forces, in partnership with longstanding U.S. partners integrated through U.S. Central Command.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Today, Vice President Kamala Harris convened more than 30 Pennsylvania state legislators who are fighting on the frontlines to protect reproductive rights. Today’s meeting in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania follows engagements about reproductive rights that the Vice President held with health care providers, faith leaders, constitutional law and privacy experts, advocates, state Attorneys General, and other state legislators. The Vice President convened state legislators from across the country on July 8, 2022 at the White House, and on July 14, 2022, she convened Florida state legislators in Orlando, Florida.<br> <br>During the meeting, the participants discussed what they can collectively do to fight for the rights of the American people and defend a woman&#8217;s right to make decisions about her own body. The state legislators described how Republican legislators in Pennsylvania are pushing for extremist laws that endanger women and jeopardize privacy rights. They discussed the intersection of attacks on abortion access and attacks on voting rights and LGBTQI+ rights – noting the importance of building coalitions to defend our democracy and work toward progress.</p>



<p>The Vice President thanked the legislators for defending reproductive rights and freedoms. She conveyed the Administration’s commitment to protecting access to reproductive health care and patient privacy, and she encouraged the state legislators to keep defending the rights of women in Pennsylvania and to work with leaders from states across the country who are experiencing similar challenges.&nbsp;The Vice President reiterated the importance of engaging at the local, state and federal level to defend democracy, strengthen the rule of law, and protect reproductive health care.&nbsp;</p>

<p>[Senior administration official], I&#8217;ll kick it over to you for some opening remarks.&nbsp; And then we can take a few questions.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; Good morning.&nbsp; I apologize, my &#8212; our time is pretty limited here this morning.&nbsp; But let me go through where we are here as we are on the final day of the President&#8217;s trip to the Middle East.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And as you heard the President say last night, he came here to Saudi Arabia to meet with the GCC and nine other leaders to discuss the security and strategic priorities of the United States and to demonstrate that we have no intent to leave a vacuum here in the Middle East, particularly for Russia or China to fill, or for that matter, Iran.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And if you’ve not yet seen this morning, we have (inaudible) a new example of some of the engagements between Russia and Iran that we think is fairly pertinent.&nbsp; I believe that there&#8217;s a story on CNN that ran this morning about this.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And as Jake mentioned last week, we assess an official Russian delegation recently received a showcase of Iranian attack-capable UAVs.&nbsp; And we released those satellite imagery that shows this, as it suggests ongoing Russian interest in acquiring Iranian attack-capable UAVs, obviously for use in there or Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And to our knowledge, this is the first time the Russian delegation has visited this airfield for such a showcase.&nbsp; And we think it&#8217;s of interest &#8212; I mean, to put it mildly &#8212; to what&#8217;s happening here in the Middle East.&nbsp; I mean, Russia is effectively making a bet on Iran, and we are making a bet on a more integrated, more stable, more peaceful and prosperous Middle East region, which is what you&#8217;ll hear throughout the summit today.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So with that, I&#8217;ll go over through the schedule for today and some of the outcomes that you can expect.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, today, the President will meet in Jeddah with leaders of the Gulf Cooperation Council &#8212; that is Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and UAE, together with the Republic of Egypt, Iraq, and the Kingdom of Jordan.&nbsp; And, you know, here these leaders discuss ways to address global challenges such as confronting new diseases, ensuring food and energy security, and addressing the climate crisis through new partnerships.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You&#8217;ll also hear the President underscore the region’s central role in connecting the Indo-Pacific to Europe, Africa, and the Americas.&nbsp; I think a theme throughout this visit is that even as we have challenges and priorities elsewhere, the importance of the Middle East, if anything, is only heightened, and we’re demonstrating that throughout the trip and the importance of America&#8217;s engagement here in this critical region.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So in his remarks during the summit, President Biden will set forth really five declaratory principles on the Biden doctrine for this region, as he is the first President to visit the Middle East since the attacks on 9/11, over 20 years ago, really without Americans involved in a major ground war or combat &#8212; combat missions.&nbsp; Principles such as partnership, deterrence, diplomacy, integration, and values that will guide U.S. engagement in the Middle East over the coming decades.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And if you just think about it, I mean, the objectives that have been pursued here in this region &#8212; it’s a theme that was in the President&#8217;s op-ed a couple of weeks ago before the visit &#8212; very &#8212; objectives such as regime change through military force, building nations, changing regime.&nbsp; Objectives that really were out of America’s reach to deliver and drained our attention and resources and capacity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now that we are focused on what we think is a far more realistic set of objectives &#8212; very central to our interests and the interests of our partners &#8212; the comparative advantage of the United States to build alliances, to build partnerships, to integrate, to find connections that don’t exist, to strengthen connections that develop is really front and center.&nbsp; So I think it is an era in which the unique capabilities of the United States can play a really important role here in forging new partnerships and strengthening alliances and coalitions.</p>



<p>In that regard, the President will also announce today that the United States has committed $1 billion in new near- to long-term food security assistance for the Middle East and North Africa region.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The President will also announce &#8212; and this will be in the communiqués that come after the summit &#8212; that the GCC leaders are committing $3 billion, over the next two years, in projects that align with the U.S. Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment &#8212; PGII.&nbsp; The goal is to deliver quality, sustainable infrastructure that make a difference in people&#8217;s lives around the world, strengthens and diversifies our supply chains, and creates new opportunities for American workers and businesses, and advances our national security.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, of course, PGII was rolled out at the G7 Summit, so you know a lot about that, but the GCC will be partnering with us with the $3 billion to advance the PGII.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You’ll also hear President Biden welcome Iraq &#8212; concluding agreements with Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Jordan &#8212; to bring affordable energy to Iraq and diversify its supply, and ensure energy resiliency to meet the growing needs of its people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And the landmark agreement that was signed just last night in Iraq and the GCC Interconnection Authority &#8212; the President mentioned this last night in his remarks &#8212; will link Iraq’s electricity grid to the grids in the GCC, thereby providing the Iraqi people with newly diversified sources of electricity over the coming decade.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s important because much of Iraq’s electricity, as of now and for many years, is very much reliant upon gas from Iran.&nbsp; So diversifying Iraq’s electricity base and generation (inaudible) sources will benefit the Iraqi people, particularly as their demand continues to grow.</p>



<p>And this connection with the GCC &#8212; between Iraq and the GCC &#8212; has really been talked about for years.&nbsp; I think the President mentioned yesterday that it was discussed when he was Vice President but it was never able to get done.&nbsp; But over, you know, the last six months or so when, again, U.S. diplomacy relationships, partnerships, creativity was able to get these important agreements over the line for the first time last night.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So all of this, of course, builds on some of the Jeddah communiqué that was released last night, and that&#8217;s a joint statement between the United States and Saudi Arabia, outlining a strategic partnership between our countries over the coming decades with the aim of advancing a more peaceful, secure, prosperous, and stable Middle East region.&nbsp; And I think we put that out and also a pretty detailed factsheet about the number of initiatives and agreements that were reached over the course of many months.&nbsp; And some of those were finalized just last night.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So we want to build on that.&nbsp; It was important for us going forward here in this important region.&nbsp; And you&#8217;ll get more details on all of this as the day unfolds.&nbsp; And I&#8217;m sure we’ll have more to say to all of you afterwards as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I have time just for a couple of questions.&nbsp; I apologize.&nbsp; I have to get upstairs to prepare with the boss here for the day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; Thank you so much [senior administration official].&nbsp; We’ll go to the line of Aamer Madhani from the Associated Press.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, just on the point with the new intelligence that was released, to what extent &#8212; and you sort of were &#8212; sort of brushed on this though &#8212; you’re showing &#8212; it shows that Russia is making its bet on Iran.&nbsp; But none of the countries’ representatives at the summit have really sanctioned Russia.&nbsp; You know, the UAE has been sort of a financial haven for some of the oligarchs.&nbsp; Egypt remains open to Russian tourists.&nbsp; How is the President going to make the point, trying to sort of connect that Russia matters to them, using this intelligence?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Well, I think the entire GCC and eight or the nine countries around the table today voted in the U.N. General Assembly back in March.&nbsp; And if you read that resolution, extremely strong condemnation of Russia&#8217;s invasion and the importance of the territorial integrity of Ukraine and everything else.&nbsp; So I think that really spoke for itself.&nbsp; That was an important statement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think we have heard &#8212; I think if you go back to this region, say, I don&#8217;t know, 18 months ago, you heard an awful lot of just really significant hedging and, I would say, in many capitals, a real drift towards Russia and even China in many ways.&nbsp; Really, that has been arrested and, in many instances, very specific instances &#8212; not all which I can talk about &#8212; reversed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So we are &#8212; these countries have relationships with Iran [sic].&nbsp; They have relationships with China.&nbsp; That is natural.&nbsp; That is something that will continue.&nbsp; I’m sorry, relationships with Russia and relations with China is something natural and will continue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But when it comes to the partnerships and the partnerships of choice, and particularly in the security realm, but also in the trade, investment, commerce, tech realm, we heard from every capital around this region that their first choice, their priority, is the United States of America.&nbsp; And that is something that we are very much committed to following up on and finding areas in which we can partner.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So I think I&#8217;ll leave it at that.</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; We have time for one more quick one with [senior administration official].&nbsp; And then thank you to [senior administration official], who’s available and will take a few more questions right afterwards.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tyler Pager from The Washington Post, over to you.</p>



<p>Okay, we’ll go to the hand of &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Oh, Tyler is here.&nbsp; Good.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; Thanks, [senior administration official].&nbsp; Two quick ones.&nbsp; There were reports last night that the UAE detained a U.S. citizen, Asim Ghafoor, a former lawyer for Khashoggi.&nbsp; I&#8217;m wondering if the President is aware of this and whether he plans to bring up his case, or figure out what happened, today at the meeting with the GCC.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Yeah, we are aware of that.&nbsp; I will say there&#8217;s no indication that it has anything to do with Khashoggi (inaudible) or anything else.&nbsp; But we are aware of it.&nbsp; I can&#8217;t say whether the President will raise it, just given the facts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But we will certainly &#8212; I think they have the points on that about the importance of consular access and everything else.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But yes, to answer your question.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; We’ll go to the line of Barak Ravid.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And as a reminder to folks to use the “raise hand” feature on Zoom if you have a question.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, thank you for doing this.&nbsp; Can you give us some more details on the island deal and the overflight deal and some, you know, behind the scenes of how it went down in the last few days before the announcement?&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Thanks, Barak.&nbsp; I think this is another deal that has been talked about in past administrations and has been tried but never achieved.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s because it&#8217;s a complex piece of Middle East diplomacy.&nbsp; Obviously, Saudi Arabia and Israel do not have relations.&nbsp; Israel and Egypt are partners from the Camp David Accords, and the U.S. are observers to that arrangement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, basically, what this arrangement does: It allows the peacekeepers at Tiran Island for 40 years to depart.&nbsp; But we have negotiated between the parties alternative security arrangements that ensure the existing arrangements in place in freedom of navigation and everything else that everybody is very comfortable with this.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And these islands will now be developed for tourism, recreation, and peaceful pursuits.&nbsp; So it just is an interesting story not only of (inaudible) Middle East diplomacy and the unique role the United States of America plays.&nbsp; There’s no other country that can do things like this.</p>



<p>And also, just turning a page, a new chapter in Middle East history, if you know the history of, obviously, (inaudible) in this area, going back to the ‘67 war, which, of course, Barak, you know well.</p>



<p>So I think in the interest of time, I don&#8217;t have too much about, you know, the back-and-forth or details on this call.&nbsp; But happy to talk to you some other time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But I thought it was a &#8212; it was a good process.&nbsp; And it’s a good development because it’s something that has been wanting to get done some for some time, and it got done.</p>



<p>And together with another issue that’s been discussed for many years, but the overflight of Saudi airspace for all civilian carriers and including, of course, Israel, which is, we think, quite a breakthrough.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And part of this theme for a more integrated Middle East region &#8212; and that is a theme you’ll hear, I think, from the leaders today at the summit &#8212; and a Middle East region that is more interconnected with the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And something I said in, I think, my first background call &#8212; and I’ll end with this: There’s been a number of trips in the Middle East with secretaries and presidents when the Middle East was really the source of global &#8212; acute global challenges.&nbsp; And today, we face acute global challenges, to say the least, but the Middle East, right in this moment, is not a primary source of them.&nbsp; And in fact, countries are coming together to actually try to help address them.&nbsp; You saw that at the I2U2 Summit in Israel.&nbsp; You’ve seen that with some of the &#8212; again, with some of the breakthroughs, such as opening airspace to planes.&nbsp; That’s &#8212; you might think that’s a simple thing, but it’s never been done.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And in the summit today with nine leaders talking about food security, talking about investment in global infrastructures to protect all of our supply chains and make sure we’re diversified as we look to the future and position ourselves to the future of 5G, 6G, new technology development, new technology cooperation between these entrepreneurial societies such as UAE (inaudible).</p>



<p>So again, I’d just leave it there.&nbsp; But I think it&#8217;s a &#8212; it was a &#8212; it&#8217;s one example of this unique capacity the United States can bring.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And given the trends here in the region towards more integration and new partnerships, it&#8217;s something where I think we have a real comparative advantage to help.&nbsp; And so, we’ll (inaudible) because it also is squarely within American interests to do that.&nbsp; And that will be a theme of the President&#8217;s address today.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Okay, sorry, guys, I got to run, but thank you so much.</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Yeah, thank you so much, [senior administration official].&nbsp; And appreciate it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thank you to [senior administration official] who was able to take three to four more questions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just as a reminder to folks who joined us late of the ground rules, this call is held on background with contents attributable to a “senior administration official,” embargoed to the end of this call.</p>



<p>As a reminder to folks, if you have a question, use the “raise hand” feature.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With that, we&#8217;ll go to Alex Ward from Politico.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks so much for doing this and, [senior administration official], for being on the call.&nbsp; A 30,000-foot question: The President likes to say that the U.S. should lead not by the example of its power, but by the power of its example.&nbsp; But the example he set here was that, ultimately, the national interest matters more than the promotion and upholding of values.&nbsp; And so, should we take from this trip that this administration will be a realist administration &#8212; one where, you know, values, while mentioned and even strongly so, pale in importance of the cold pursuit of strategic interests?&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Thanks, Alex.&nbsp; You know, it&#8217;s difficult to say that values are going to be a key part of your foreign policy, and human rights matter significantly to us as a nation and certainly as an administration, and then not go overseas and not talk to leaders in candid, forthright ways about those concerns.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It would be backsliding if the President didn’t come to the region.&nbsp; It would be backsliding if he didn’t &#8212; wasn’t willing to sit and raise human rights concerns with foreign leaders around the world.&nbsp; And he noted for you last night that it was the very first thing he brought up &#8212; Mr. Khashoggi’s killing.&nbsp; The first thing.&nbsp; It wasn’t &#8212; it wasn’t an “oh, by the way.”&nbsp; It wasn’t an add-on at the end of the meeting.&nbsp; It was the first thing he brought up.</p>



<p>And so that very much is a powerful example of how he’s placing values in human rights right at the center.&nbsp; In fact, I’d go so far, literally, to say right at the forefront of our foreign policy.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a>And that doesn’t mean when you &#8212; when you do that, it certainly doesn’t mean that you are also eschewing opportunities to pursue tangible results.&nbsp; And [senior administration official] walked you through a lot of the tangible results that we’re going to see again today.</a></p>



<p>As a matter of fact, what the President believes is that the best way to achieve tangible results is to be known as a straightshooter and to be &#8212; and to be unafraid to be as candid and forthcoming with our partners as we can.&nbsp; That’s where partnerships really begin, and that’s where trust begins &#8212; not through disingenuous statements that aren’t backed up, but through actual &#8212; the actual delivery of our values overseas, the delivery of statement of our values overseas and being willing to bring those up.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So I would say it’s not only not &#8212; not dissonance from tangibly achieving pragmatic, real politic results, it’s actually part and partial of the ability to do that is critical to the ability to do that.</p>



<p><a>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Next, we’ll go to the line of (inaudible) from Asharq Al-Awsat News.</a></p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Good morning.&nbsp; Can you hear me?&nbsp;</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Yes, ma’am.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Good morning, [senior administration official].&nbsp; Thanks for doing this.&nbsp; A good question.&nbsp; Yesterday, the President spoke about responding &#8212; or approaching the security needs for Saudi Arabia.&nbsp; Can you elaborate a little bit about that?&nbsp;</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Yeah, I won’t get into too much detail because we’re obviously still in discussions with Saudi Arabia.<a>&nbsp; But I would &#8212; I do want to &#8212; you highlighted something that I do think is worth just another foot stomp, and that’s this idea of integrated air and missile defense.&nbsp; And you’ll see that coming out of the discussions today, one of the things that the President wants us to continue to pursue.&nbsp; This is not a new idea; this is something we’ve been working on for a while.<br><br>Our allies and partners here in the region, each of them have air and missile defense capabilities.&nbsp; We are responsible for contributing to much of those capabilities.&nbsp; And we believe &#8212; and in our bilateral discussions with several nations, we believe they believe &#8212; that there is great advantage to try and see if we can’t network some of those capabilities together.<br><br>And it’s a reflection of &#8212; well, I guess of three things.&nbsp;</a></p>



<p>One, terrific technological leaps and advances in air and defense capabilities that the United States is and will continue to share in the region.<br><br>Two, the growing threat from Iran’s ballistic missile capability, which continues to have nations here in the region increasingly on edge.&nbsp; We know they’re advancing that capability and at a clip that’s disconcerning &#8212; disconcerting, sorry.<br><br>And then the third thing, and [senior administration official] sort of touched on this a little bit when he talked about the Russian visit, but it’s the advances in Iranian UAV development.<br><br>They have a domestic production capability and an operational doctrine and concept that continues to advance and grow and improve.&nbsp; And you’re seeing them use UAVs more and more in the maritime environment, certainly on the ground in Iraq and in Syria.&nbsp; And those drones, as they become of greater range and of greater power and capability, greater payload delivery capability, continue to threaten all our neighbors here in the Gulf region.<br><br>And so that&#8217;s another reason why we believe a stronger networked integrated air defense system is probably (inaudible) &#8212; an integrated air defense capability is the right path forward.<br><br>Now, look, we&#8217;re also across the defense partnerships we have with nations all throughout the region, and we have robust defense partnerships with Gulf countries.&nbsp; We’re going to continue to work that bilaterally individually, whether &#8212; you know, I talked about air defense a little bit, but it’s not just air defense, it’s in the maritime domain.<br><br>As you know, our Fifth Fleet is headquartered in Bahrain.&nbsp; The Saudis are going to be taking command of a task force &#8212; Task Force 150 &#8212; under the U.S. Central Command’s naval component here in the Gulf.&nbsp; That’s significant.&nbsp; They’re going to be leading a taskforce up in the northern Persian Gulf.<br><br>So there’s an awful lot going on bilaterally and multilaterally that we’re going to continue to work on.</p>



<p>I don’t have, again, individual, like, arms sales to speak to today.&nbsp; That wouldn’t be appropriate anyway.&nbsp; But the takeaway is that all nations here are mindful of the increased threats, particularly posed by Iran, and we’re going to continue to work with them across a range of military capabilities to see if we can’t better net those capabilities together and better help defend not only themselves but each other.<br><br>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; We have time for two more questions.&nbsp; We’ll go to Andrew Restuccia from the Wall Street Journal.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; Just a couple quick things.&nbsp; On the Yemen ceasefire announcement, can you give us any more specifics &#8212; and apologies if this was asked already; I missed the beginning of the call.&nbsp; Could you give us any more specifics on where that goes from here, when we might see talks resume, and if anyone asked the Houthis about this idea of extending the ceasefire?<br><br>And then, also, on the integrated air defense issue, where does it stand in terms of including Israel in that?<br><br>And did the Saudis at all commit to a specific number in terms of how much OPEC+ will increase production at the meeting yesterday?</p>



<p><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; I won&#8217;t speak for Saudi Arabia and OPEC.&nbsp; I will just leave you with what the President said about &#8212; you know, that we&#8217;re hopeful in coming weeks we&#8217;ll see some additional announcements.<br><br>On the integrated air missile defense, again, we believe there&#8217;s great value in including as many of the capabilities in this region as possible.&nbsp; And certainly Israel has significant air and missile defense capabilities, as they need to.&nbsp; And &#8212; but we&#8217;re having these discussions bilaterally with these nations.&nbsp; And I don&#8217;t want to get ahead of where we are.<br><br>But I would just say that if you are &#8212; if you truly are trying to seek integrated air and missile defense, the more integrated, the better, the more powerful.&nbsp; So we&#8217;re obviously looking to have it be as robust as possible.<br><br>On the ceasefire in Yemen, again, <a>I&#8217;m loath to get ahead of</a> the future announcements, but what was noteworthy was that the Saudis committed to wanting to extend it themselves.&nbsp; So we&#8217;re on the 15th week now.&nbsp; This is the first &#8212; we&#8217;re on a first extension of a two-month ceasefire.&nbsp; And we have every indication now that the Saudis are interested in continuing that.&nbsp; And that was certainly welcome news.<br><br>I think I’ll let and be appropriate for me to let the Saudis speak to whatever discussions they&#8217;re having with the Houthis or how they&#8217;re handling it.&nbsp; I think it&#8217;d be more appropriate for them to speak to that.<br><br>But we obviously took as a very positive sign that the Saudi government is interested in pursuing that going forward.&nbsp; And I think, you know, we&#8217;ll &#8212; I&#8217;ll leave it to them to further characterize it.<br><br>I mean, we&#8217;ve now seen the longest time of relative peace in Yemen that we have in six, seven years.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s significant because not only are lives being saved every day, but, to your second question on this, you are allowing &#8212; you&#8217;re building confidence on both sides in each other.&nbsp; You&#8217;re building a little bit of trust.&nbsp; And you&#8217;re buying time and space for the possibility of negotiations to restart.<br><br>And as the President has said on numerous occasions, that&#8217;s really the only way to end this war, is through a negotiated settlement working through the U.N.&nbsp; We have not changed our position on the importance of that being the modality, that being the venue.&nbsp; And, again, the longer we can have relative peace where both sides aren&#8217;t shooting at one another, the better chances that we&#8217;re going to have to build the kind of &#8212; set the kind of conditions for there to be a negotiated settlement.</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; And for our final question, we&#8217;ll go to Ben Samuels from Haaretz.</p>



<p><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey, [senior administration official].&nbsp; Thanks for doing this.&nbsp; So the Saudi foreign minister essentially said last night that there won&#8217;t be full Israel-Saudi normalization until a two-state solution is reached.&nbsp; I know the administration has tried to sort of temper the timeline in terms of both full normalization and a two-state solution, but I&#8217;m wondering if you could clarify whether you think Israel-Saudi normalization is possible without reaching that sort of two-state solution?&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, what I would tell you is, you know, issues of norm- &#8212; first of all, we obviously support normalization, and we were excited by the announcement on airspace and, of course, the island announcement that [senior administration official] walked you through.  All of those are very positive signs.<br><br>But we know that these are sovereign decisions that these two nations have to make.  And we would not want to impose ourselves in that decision-making process or make those decisions for them.<br><br>The President said himself the other day, when asked about this, it&#8217;s going to take some time; we know that.  You&#8217;re talking about issues that are historic in nature and go back many, many, many years.  And so we understand that they&#8217;ve got to work this out in their own time.<br><br>At the same time, and this was why the President&#8217;s visit to Bethlehem was so important, we don&#8217;t &#8212; well, we don&#8217;t want to &#8212; we believe that working towards a two-state solution is important in and of itself.  It&#8217;s not in congruence with the idea of normalization, of course.  But all by itself, as an issue, a two-state solution still remains top of mind for President Biden when it comes to Middle East peace.<br><br>That&#8217;s why he wanted to go see President Abbas.  That&#8217;s why he wanted to reaffirm his commitment to it.  And that&#8217;s why he said, quite frankly, that when it comes to a two-state solution, both sides have to want it as well.  They have to be willing to work towards it.  And if they do, they&#8217;ll find no better friend than the United States of America.<br><br>Now, we were encouraged when Prime Minister Lapid called President Abbas.  We thought that was a good first step here, and we&#8217;d like to see additional steps taken.<br><br>But we&#8217;re going to stay committed to a two-state solution all by itself, because all by itself, it’s so critical to Middle East peace.</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Okay, those are all the questions we have time for.&nbsp; Again, thank you to all for joining this background call today.&nbsp; As a reminder of the ground rules, it was held on background, attributable to “senior administration officials.”&nbsp; The embargo on the contents are now lifted.<br><br>Thank you, everyone, and have a good day.</p>
