<p class="has-text-align-center">Grand Hyatt Seoul<br>Seoul, Republic of Korea</p>



<p>11:22 A.M. KST</p>



<p>PRESIDENT BIDEN:&nbsp; Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p>



<p>CHAIRMAN CHUNG:&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>PRESIDENT BIDEN:&nbsp; Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman.&nbsp; It&#8217;s &#8212; I think the last time we were together, we were at a university.&nbsp; Was it two thousand and &#8212;</p>



<p>CHAIRMAN CHUNG:&nbsp; Yeah, Yonsei University.&nbsp; 2013.</p>



<p>PRESIDENT BIDEN:&nbsp; 2013.&nbsp; He showed me a picture.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t have a lot more hair then either.&nbsp; (Laughs.)</p>



<p>It&#8217;s great to be here to announce the more than $10 billion in new investment in American manufacturing.&nbsp; This new commitment of $5 billion for advanced automotive technology and $5.5 billion investment to open a new factory near Savannah, Georgia, is going to create more than 8,000 new American jobs.</p>



<p>The plan is to break ground as soon as January of 2023.&nbsp; And the new facility should be rolling out the latest electric vehicles and batteries to power them by 2025.</p>



<p>And the workers in Georgia who will build these pla- &#8212; these plants and manufacture this new electric battery technology, it means economic opportunity for an awful lot of Americans.</p>



<p>And I want to commend my friends and the two senators in Georgia, Rafael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, for how they&#8217;ve been fighting for Georgia to be the magnet for this clean energy investment.</p>



<p>And these investments are part of a trend my administration &#8212; in my administration.&nbsp; Manufacturing jobs are coming back to America.</p>



<p>Even before these new investments, my administration, since coming to office, created 545,000 new manufacturing jobs since we took office.</p>



<p>And thanks to Hyundai, we are being part of this transformative automobile sector and accelerating us on the road where we’re going to be <s>handling </s>[heading] to &#8212; the United States &#8212; an all-electric future.  And that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re shooting for.</p>



<p>Our administration is setting ambitious standards to cut pollution in cars and trucks and boost &#8212; boost fuel economy standards for those continuing to operate on gasoline.</p>



<p>And last year, standing together with the CEOs of major American manufacturers, along with the CEO and the head of the United Auto Workers, I signed an executive order setting a goal of having 50 percent of all new vehicles sold by the year 2030 be electric.&nbsp; And it’s an ambitious target, I know, but I believe we can meet it.</p>



<p>But we’re all committed to making it happen &#8212; auto companies, American UAW, and the &#8212; and the federal government as well &#8212; because all understand the same basic thing: Electric vehicles are good for our climate goals, but they’re also good for jobs, and they’re good for business.</p>



<p>Hyundai and any company investing in the United States would benefit greatly from entering into partnerships with some of the most highly skilled, dedicated, and engaged workers in the world, anywhere you can find.&nbsp; And that is American union members.</p>



<p>And again, every venture to manufacture electric vehicles and electric vehicle batteries would be made stronger by a collective bargaining relationship with our unions.</p>



<p>Investing aggressively in electric vehicles and battery production now &#8212; now, not tomorrow &#8212; now &#8212; is also important for strengthening our long-term economic security and accelerating progress toward a clean-energy future.</p>



<p>You know, because of Putin’s war, we’ve been sort of knocked off slightly, a little bit, because of the impact of the &#8212; impact of Russian oil on Europe.<br><br>But batteries &#8212; batteries that will be made at this new facility in Georgia are going to power cars without one drop of gasoline and increase security of our battery supply chains as well.</p>



<p>That’s going to serve &#8212; save families money at the pump because they can skip the pump altogether.  And instead, families will be able to stop at one of 500,000 new electric vehicle stations &#8212; part of the network we’re going to be building across America with the $7.5 billion in funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. </p>



<p>And the Chairman told me walking out here that they’re also going to be investing in battery techno- &#8212; in charging stations as well.</p>



<p>My administration &#8212; and, by the way, when you invest in a charging station along a highway, it’s a little bit like years and years ago, when we were starting to build automobiles in America and you’re investing in a gas station.&nbsp; Other things pop up around it.&nbsp; It has &#8212; it has an effect of generating economic growth just by putting in the station.&nbsp; And I think you’re going to see that as well in the United States.</p>



<p>My administration is supercharging efforts to lead the electric future.</p>



<p>We’re also making historic investments in battery &#8212; battery manufacturing, clean transit, and light rail.</p>



<p>For example, we’re going to be investing $5 billion to transform our fleet of nearly 500,000 polluting, diesel school buses into clean, all-electric vehicles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And my climate and jobs agenda is making the United States a premier destination for savvy private firms looking to invest in the electric vehicle future.</p>



<p>In fact, today’s welcome announcement by Hyundai comes on top of an additional $100 billion of investments in the last year from companies in America &#8212; in American manufacturing to build electric vehicles and electric batteries.</p>



<p>And so, folks, the administration is going to stay laser-focused on innovation and batteries and EVs, building out our infrastructure and increasing the market demand.</p>



<p>So, Chairman Chung, thank you again for choosing the United States.&nbsp; We will not let you down.</p>



<p>And over these last two days, I’ve been focusing all my &#8212; all the ways in which the Republic of Korea and the United States can work closely together to shape the direction of our world for the better.</p>



<p>This deal is another prime example of how that partnership &#8212; and innovation, expertise, and values that drive both the Korean and American people &#8212; are delivering for the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So I thank you all for being part of this very integral clean, electric vehicle future, not only here but in my country, and for deepening the ties between our two great democracies.</p>



<p>Thank you all so very much.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; President Biden, are you concerned about a North Korean missile test while you’re here in Asia?</p>



<p>PRESIDENT BIDEN:&nbsp; We are prepared for anything North Korea does.&nbsp; We’ve had &#8212; we’ve thought through how we would respond to whatever they do.&nbsp; And so, I am not concerned, if that’s what you’re suggesting.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you have a message for Kim Jong Un while you&#8217;re here?</p>



<p>PRESIDENT BIDEN:&nbsp; “Hello.”&nbsp; Period.</p>



<p>Thank you.<br><br>11:29 A.M. KST</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">National Museum of Korea<br>Seoul, Republic of Korea</p>



<p>7:40 P.M. KST</p>



<p>PRESIDENT YOON:&nbsp; (As interpreted.)&nbsp; Mr. President, distinguished members of the U.S. delegation, all fellow supporters of our alliance, ladies and gentlemen: It is an honor to welcome you here tonight.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This year marks 140th anniversary of our diplomatic ties, and next year we celebrate 70 years of alliance between our two nations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At today’s summit talks, Mr. President and I&nbsp; reaffirmed our enduring commitment to the robust ROK-U.S. alliance and to seek together a new promise and future for our two countries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 1950, when communist invasion put my beloved homeland in peril, America’s sons and daughters fought together and sacrificed their lives to defend the freedom of a country they never knew.&nbsp; Thus, the ROK-U.S. alliance was forged in blood on the battlefield of the Korean War.</p>



<p>Since then, the alliance has been a strong foundation which buttressed Korea’s economic growth and prosperity based on free democracy and market economy.</p>



<p>The KORUS FTA, since it came into effect a decade ago, has created many decent jobs and promoted investment in Korea as well as in the United States.&nbsp; The bond between the Republic of Korea and the United States will grow even deeper.&nbsp; The cooperation between our two nations will become only stronger.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sharing universal values of free democracy, human rights, and rule of law, our alliance will go beyond security to a cutting-edge technology alliance and to a global comprehensive strategic alliance.&nbsp; I will draw and design a new future vision of our alliance with you, Mr. President.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mr. President, there’s a line from the poem, “The Municipal Gallery Revisited,” by William Butler Yeats, one of your favorite poets.&nbsp; It goes:</p>



<p>“Think where man’s glory most begins and ends,</p>



<p>And say my glory was I had such friends.”</p>



<p>The United States is such friend to Korea and so is the Republic of Korea to the United States.&nbsp; So now let me propose a toast to our dear friendship, to our shared journey for the freedom and human rights of all citizens around the world, and to the peace and prosperity of the region and beyond.&nbsp; We go to together.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>(A toast is given.)</p>



<p>PRESIDENT BIDEN:&nbsp; Well, thank you, Mr. President.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve had very productive meetings today.&nbsp; And &#8212; but even more importantly, we&#8217;ve gotten a chance to get to know one another personally.&nbsp; We shared a lot of stories from our &#8212; (laughs) &#8212; early beginnings, and I think maybe we told each other too much.&nbsp; I don’t know.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; But &#8212; (translator begins) &#8212; please.</p>



<p>The idea you would quote William Butler Yeats, I appreciate very much.&nbsp;&nbsp;(Laughter.)&nbsp; That wouldn’t happen in London.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Revit- &#8212; Revitalizing this alliance was one of my key foreign policy priorities when I took office last year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mr. President, your country&#8217;s democracy shows the power to be able to deliver for its people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We&#8217;re proud to say, as the general who was with me today can say as well, that our armed forces stand side-by-side, standing sentinel on a Peninsula for seven decades to preserve the peace and make possible that shared prosperity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, I&#8217;d like to raise a glass.&nbsp; May the alliance between our two great nations continue to flourish through all the decades ahead.&nbsp; And as our combined forces say, &#8220;We go together.&#8221;&nbsp; Hear, hear.</p>



<p>(A toast is given.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">The People&#8217;s House<br>Seoul, Republic of Korea<br><br>(May 21, 2022)</p>



<p>4:18 P.M. KST</p>



<p>PRESIDENT YOON:&nbsp; (As interpreted.)&nbsp; Mr. President Biden, it is my honor to welcome you to the Republic of Korea.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At this summit, we shared the goal of developing the ROK-U.S. alliance into a global, comprehensive, strategic alliance, and we discussed relevant actions to that end.&nbsp; Moreover, we engaged in a candid conversation, building friendship and trust.</p>



<p>Today, I also realized that President Biden and I see eye-to-eye on so many fronts.&nbsp; Over the past 69 years, the ROK-U.S. alliance has evolved into the linchpin of peace and prosperity in the region.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, a longstanding mission of denuclearizing North Korea, as well as the COVID-19 crisis, shifting trade order, supply chain realignment, climate change, democracy in crisis, and numerous other new challenges confront our alliance.&nbsp; These challenges can be tackled only when countries sharing the universal values of a liberal democracy and human rights come together.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ROK- U.S. alliance sets an exemplary model of such solidarity.&nbsp; Korea and the U.S., as global comprehensive strategic allies, stand ready to meet these challenges collectively and shape a rules-based order in that process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These aspirations that President Biden and I share are well reflected in the joint statement we&#8217;re adopting today.&nbsp; In the negotiations leading up to the joint statement, our two countries’ deputies have exhibited trust and partnership, which I note with appreciation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A sustainable peace on the Korean Peninsula is underpinned by a principled and consistent policy towards North Korea.&nbsp; In lockstep coordination with the Biden administration, I commit to resolutely safeguard peace on the Korean Peninsula and encourage North Korea to come forward for dialogue and engage in practical cooperation.&nbsp; I will exert diplomatic endeavors to that end.</p>



<p>We, as the leaders of the two countries, reiterated our common goal of the complete denuclearization of the DPRK.&nbsp; There is no compromise for security.&nbsp; Under this shared belief, we concurred that strong deterrence against North Korea is paramount.&nbsp;</p>



<p>President Biden affirmed the ironclad U.S. commitment to the defense of the Republic of Korea and substantive extended deterrence.&nbsp; At the same time, our two countries hope to see North Korea take the path towards genuine denuclearization.&nbsp; Together with a community of nations, we pledge to spare no diplomatic efforts to that end.&nbsp;</p>



<p>U.N. Security Council resolutions will also be faithfully and fully implemented together with other countries.&nbsp; The door to dialogue remains open if North Korea genuinely embarks upon denuclearization.&nbsp; In partnership with the international community, I am prepared to present an audacious plan that will vastly strengthen its economy and improve the quality of life for its people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Currently, North Korea is struggling with a COVID-19 crisis.&nbsp; Putting aside political and military considerations, I am more than willing to provide assistance from humanitarian and human rights perspectives.&nbsp; I call on North Korea to respond to this proposal positively and begin taking practical steps towards denuclearization.</p>



<p>We live in an era where economy is security and security, in turn, is economy.&nbsp; Supply chain disruptions resulting from a change in global security order are directly linked to the lives of our people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To adapt to the new reality, the ROK- U.S. alliance must also evolve further &#8212; not just with words, but with actions.&nbsp; We should ceaselessly strive to deliver real benefits that can impact the peoples of our two countries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>President Biden and I &#8212; in the field of semiconductors, batteries, civil nuclear power, space development, cyberspace, and other emerging industries &#8212; agree to step up our practical cooperation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Market shocks stemming from a shifting international order will also be actively addressed through our collective response.&nbsp; And as a first step, our Offices of the President will launch an economic security dialogue so that in supply chains, advanced science and technology, and other areas of economic security, our two countries can have timely communication and cooperation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An orderly and well-functioning foreign exchange market is crucial to sustainable growth and financial stability.&nbsp; To that end, President Biden and I decided to engage in even closer consultation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For advanced reactors and small modular reactors development and export promotion, our two countries’ civil nuclear industries committed to work together.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, our two nations, with regard to the defense industry now emerging as a future growth engine, concurred to initiate discussions on a reciprocal Defense Procurement Agreement that can be likened to an FTA in the defense sector.</p>



<p>Korea, amid the ravages of war, achieved a remarkable growth with the help of the United States and the wider international community.&nbsp; The world now recognizes us as an advanced democracy, the 10th-largest economy, and a cultural powerhouse.</p>



<p>We stand ready to proactively fulfill the role expected of us by the international community to honor our responsibility and commitment.<br><br>The Indo-Pacific is a region important to both our countries.  Our two nations will work in concert to build a rules-based order in the Indo-Pacific.  And taking that first step is to participate in the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework.<br><br>With a view to expanding our contributions and roles in the region, we will also work to formulate a relevant strategy.<br><br>Our two countries, in response to immediate global challenges, will pursue even closer coordination.<br><br>A tragedy brought on by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine must be resolved swiftly so that the people can return to their peaceful, normal lives.<br><br>To that end, Korea and the United States decided to cooperate vigorously with the international community.<br><br>Building on the KORUS Global Vaccine Partnership, Korea will actively join the global fight against COVID-19.  A Global Health Security coordinating office will be established in Seoul as a way to contribute to sustainable global health security.<br><br>In addressing the existential threat to humanity posed by climate change, our two countries will endeavor to achieve our 2030 greenhouse gas reduction targets and 2050 net-zero emission goals through even greater coordination.<br><br>The friendship and trust I have forged with President Biden today will pave the way for further reinforcing our bilateral partnership for a new era.  Towards this goal, I hope our two countries will engage in frequent communication and close consultation with each other.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>Next, we’re going to invite the President of the United States for his statement.</p>



<p>PRESIDENT BIDEN:&nbsp; Thank you for all the time that you gave me today, particularly our private conversations and the incredible hospitality and welcome we’ve received.<br><br>I&#8217;m honored to be able to be &#8212; to meet you so early in your tenure, and it’s a pleasure to get to know &#8212; get to know you personally.<br><br>I’m delighted to be back in your beautiful country and at a time when the alliance between the Republic of Korea and the United States has never been stronger, more vibrant, or, I might add, more vital.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I believe that this trip is coming at a particularly interesting moment, because we’re seeing so many expectations in Asia and the broader Indo-Pacific region being updated.&nbsp; I &#8212; I’m looking forward to it even occurring more.<br><br>My administration is pursuing an economic strategy designed to grow our economy from the bottom up and the middle out, and it’s paying dividends.&nbsp; Even in the face of historic economic challenges, our economy is providing and proving to be resilient.</p>



<p>In fact, just yesterday, an independent analysis projected that the American economy is poised to grow at a faster rate than China &#8212; than the Chinese economy for the first time in 45 years, since 1976.</p>



<p>And our relationship with our allies &#8212; including, I’m proud to say, the Republic of Korea &#8212; are closer than they’ve ever been.&nbsp; And our people are growing even closer as we speak.</p>



<p>Our businesses are blazing new trails together.&nbsp; And &#8212; and it all goes to my core belief, something I’ve said for a long time: It’s never a good bet to bet against the United States of America.</p>



<p>We’re a nation that is all about one thing: possibilities.&nbsp; Endless possibilities.&nbsp; <a>And that optimism is a commitment and &#8212; commitment to an innovation where breaking barriers is something that Koreans and Americans share.&nbsp;</a></p>



<p>Yesterday, the President and I visited a factory where Korean and American innovation are working in tandem to produce the most advanced semiconductors in the world.&nbsp; And I welcome the billions of dollars of investment that Korean companies like Samsung are making in the United States &#8212; investments that will bring our two countries even closer together, cooperating even more closely than we already do, and help strengthen our supply chains, secure them against shocks, and give our economies a competitive edge.</p>



<p>Today, President Yoon and I discussed the broad range of issues, as he’s mentioned today &#8212; I apologize for repeating him &#8212; on both regional and global terms.&nbsp; The cooperation between the Republic <s>in</s> [of] Korea and the United States is vital to our shared strategic progress &#8212; at least, we both believe that.</p>



<p>From fighting this pandemic to strengthening global health security, health systems, and so that we can better be prepared for the next major global health event &#8212; and there will be others; from increasing our climate ambitions to accelerating climate solutions, like development of electric vehicles; from standing up to our shared &#8212; for our shared democratic values and defending a rule-based international order against threats in stability, our alliance is making important contributions to shape the future for our children.&nbsp; And Korea’s strong and its dynamic economy is a powerful example of that for the rest of the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I also want to thank the people of Korea for their strong support for the people of Ukraine.</p>



<p>Putin’s war against Ukraine isn’t just a matter for Europe, it’s an attack on democracy and the core international principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity.</p>



<p>And the Republic of Korea and the United States are standing together &#8212; part of a global response with our allies and partners around the world &#8212; to condemn Russia’s flagrant violations of international law, and to hold Russia accountable, and to support the people of Ukraine.</p>



<p>Tomorrow, the President and I will be visiting with the Korean and American troops who are still serving side-by-side even today, decades after our troops first fought valiantly together, to preserve the freedom of the Republic of Korea.</p>



<p>It’s emblematic of our strength and our continuing strength, and of the durability of our alliance and our readiness to take on all threats together.</p>



<p>And today, President Yoon and I committed to strengthening our close engagement and work together to take on challenges of regional security, including addressing the threat posed by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea by further strengthening our deterrence posture and working toward a complete denuclearization of the prin- &#8212; of the Korean Peninsula, as the President has already spoken to; promoting stability across the Taiwan Straits as well; and ensuring freedom of navigation, including in the South China Sea and beyond.</p>



<p>So thank you again, Mr. President, for your warm welcome, for your commitment to strengthening our alliance, and for explan- &#8212; expanding our global partnership.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I look forward to years to come.</p>



<p>Now, I believe &#8212; who asks the first question?</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; (As interpreted.)&nbsp; Now we’re going to open the floor for questions and answers.&nbsp; The presidents of the two countries will be &#8212; designate a person that will be asking questions.</p>



<p>Now we&#8217;ll be taking a question from &#8212; a Korean journalist will be posing a question to the Korean president.&nbsp; So please raise your hand, and the president will designate a person for the question.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (As interpreted.) &nbsp;Thank you for this opportunity to pose a question.&nbsp; My name is Han Ji-hoon, Yonhap News Agency.</p>



<p>First, regarding the concept of economic security, a number</p>



<p>of Koreans find the concept pretty unfamiliar.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So what are the benefits the Korean economy can gain from the economic security promote &#8212; cooperation?&nbsp; What are the real benefits that can be experienced by the Korean people?<br><br>And in addition to that, you talked about universal values &#8212; solidarity and alliance &#8212; and you very much underscored that point.&nbsp; But if there are, for example, countries that cannot share those values &#8212; for example, strong export regulations or controls that the United States is imposing on other countries &#8212; do you think you can take &#8212; resort to those measures as well?<br><br>PRESIDENT YOON:&nbsp; (As interpreted.)&nbsp; As you may be very well aware, economic security is probably something that you have already heard and seen through various newspaper channels.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s say, for example, this is directly related to the livelihoods of our people.&nbsp; And important industrial goods, for them to be produced &#8212; for example, let&#8217;s say that we&#8217;re trying to produce and manu- &#8212; a car &#8212; the unique system of semiconductors.&nbsp; And, for example, we had (inaudible) water issues recently.&nbsp; And so these are materials that are critically needed for our daily lives as well as our industrial production. &nbsp;</p>



<p>And to secure stability in the supply chain is very much and directly related to the lives of the people as well as the national economy.&nbsp; And this is, in turn, related to the national security as well as military security.</p>



<p>And in the past, we had the WTO system that brought countries together to form a free and universal trading order, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the formation of the blocks in the market, we see permanent risks when it comes to the supply chain.&nbsp; So it is very important to stabilize the supply chain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And especially our two countries, the United States and Korea, we share the values of democracy and human rights.&nbsp; And among the likeminded countries, they share the values that would be important to stabilize the supply chain.&nbsp; That is why we need to deal with the issue of economic security.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The NSCs of the Offices of the President are given that authority to deal with this issue.&nbsp; And, for example, if there are any difficult issues to be resolved, then the two countries will be engaged in closer cooperation for economic security.&nbsp; And we decided to pursue this goal going forward.<br><br>In addition, if you look at the financial market or the foreign exchange market, there could be possible shocks.&nbsp; And when that happens, the two countries can step in to help with each other, and also related to the military security and also economic security.&nbsp; Especially in relation to the export of defense items, what the two countries hope to do is to initiate the negotiations in this area so that we can pave the way for promoting our cooperation in the specific fields.<br><br>This is not just cooperation in terms of words or empty words &#8212; empty promises. &nbsp;It is going to be an alliance that takes action together.&nbsp; And we decided to evolve our alliance even further.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And the United States and Korea, we advocate democracy, human rights, and freedom.&nbsp; And even those countries that are not sharing those specific values, for the world peace, of course, we’re not trying to exclude them in the process, but we want these countries to be embraced in these universal values.</p>



<p>So, especially, we want to start this close solidarity and cooperation among the likeminded countries and countries that share the values.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; (As interpreted.)&nbsp; Now we&#8217;ll take the question from the American journalist who will be posing questions to the American President.&nbsp; Please raise your hand.</p>



<p>PRESIDENT BIDEN:&nbsp; Trevor Hunnicutt.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; First of all, President Yoon, your joint statement mentions a number of initiatives that you&#8217;ll be taking on the security front, but it doesn&#8217;t mention whether you asked the President for nuclear bombers, submarines, or aircraft carriers.&nbsp; Are those of interest to you?&nbsp; And do you expect that the President will be deploying them?</p>



<p>And for you, President Biden, there is no mention in the joint statement about whether there would be any preconditions for you meeting with North Korea&#8217;s Kim or providing vaccines to North Korea.&nbsp; And so, I wanted to see if there are any preconditions for that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And then, ahead of your meetings in Tokyo, I understand that they will be asking for you to consider rejoining the TPP that was negotiated by President Obama.&nbsp; Could you talk a little bit about your thinking about whether this Indo-Pacific Economic Framework can lead to a bigger trade deal in the region?&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>PRESIDENT BIDEN:&nbsp; Would you like me to go first?</p>



<p>The answer with regard to would I meet &#8212; would I provide vaccines for North Korea and would I prepare to meet: The answer is yes.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve offered vaccines not only to North Korea but to China as well, and we&#8217;re prepared to do that immediately.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve gotten no response.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With regard to whether I would meet with the leader of North Korea, that would be dependent on whether he was sincere and whether it was serious.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What was the other question you asked me?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The TPP &#8212; the TPP and whether there&#8217;s room for a broader trade deal to come out of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework.&nbsp; We understand that Japan and others would like you to consider &#8212; reconsider joining.</p>



<p>PRESIDENT BIDEN:&nbsp; Well, I think what you&#8217;re going to see is &#8212; what we&#8217;re talking about in terms of this &#8212; this arrangement we&#8217;re discussing now, it&#8217;s &#8212; it&#8217;s quite significant.&nbsp; And what we&#8217;re talking about is, as it was pointed out, an economic strategy that &#8212; for the Ind- &#8212; the entire Indo-Pacific region.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And it&#8217;s working on &#8212; in critical areas in the supply chain, not just the semiconductors, but a range of other products as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Semiconductors, which is &#8212; we&#8217;ve already discussed a little bit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Infrastructure and making sure we make available the capacity to provide modern infrastructure to many of the countries in the region who may not have the capacity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Three, the &#8212; a digital economy, dealing with cybersecurity standards and sharing major standards of data access, based on the boundaries within trust.&nbsp; And that we &#8212; that needs to be done, in our view.</p>



<p>As well as a clean and renewable environment, clean energy technologies, a global minimum tax; the tax side of the equation, just like we &#8212; we recently negotiated; and deal with establishing foreign product- &#8212; practices act &#8212; effect internationally.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All that is quite broad, and it is separate from and also semi-inclusive of what the TPP was about.&nbsp; So, this is the objective that I have in mind &#8212; we have in mind at the front end here.</p>



<p>PRESIDENT YOON:&nbsp; (As interpreted.)&nbsp; A journalist from the U.S. posed me a question regarding extended deterrence.&nbsp; Let me address that question.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Every day, we&#8217;re seeing North Korea advancing its nuclear and missile capabilities.&nbsp; And President Biden and I shared grave concerns.&nbsp; And more than anything else, we believe that this is something that merits our utmost attention.</p>



<p>President Biden also reiterated and reemphasized his commitment &#8212; the U.S. commitment to effective extended deterrence.&nbsp; And at the same time, key to our combined defense capability is the combined military exercises.&nbsp; And we are going to step up our exercises, and we will be coordinating between ourselves regarding the deployment of U.S. strategic military assets.&nbsp; We will take some time in coordinating between ourselves.</p>



<p>And regarding the cyber threats or the threats emanating from North Korea&#8217;s asymmetrical capabilities, we will continue to consult with one another as to how to counter those threats.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And at the same time, we will reactivate the EDSCG and we will continue to advance and step up our high-level consultative mechanisms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I hope that I answered your question.</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; (As interpreted.)&nbsp; So, we&#8217;re taking questions from Korean journalists and American journalists.&nbsp; But &#8212; so, we&#8217;ll go back to the Korean journalists.&nbsp; So please keep your question to just one item.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am Cho Young-min from Channel A.&nbsp; Thank you very much for giving me this opportunity to pose a question.&nbsp; We &#8212; this is an extension of the previous question.</p>



<p>We talked about how to respond to the evolving nuclear threat of North Korea, that you said that you&#8217;re going to present an action plan to strengthen the effect of extended deterrence.&nbsp; So, regarding that action plan, I wonder what kind of specific discussions you had today.&nbsp; Did you see eye-to-eye on this action plan?</p>



<p>PRESIDENT YOON:&nbsp; (As interpreted.)&nbsp; In the past, when it came to extended deterrence, we just talked about a nuclear umbrella.&nbsp; That was what I thought about extended deterrence in the past.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But beyond that, there could be many other aspects, including fighters, bombers, and missiles.&nbsp; So, regarding the timely deployment of such strategic assets, we did engage in the discussions today.</p>



<p>And going forward, I believe that there will be more concrete discussions between our two sides.&nbsp; That was our agreement, and it will be between our NSCs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And also, as I already stated in the course of answering the question from the U.S. journalist: In order to prepare against a possible nuclear attack, our two countries combined military exercises, I believe, should be stepped up in many aspects.&nbsp; We had that discussion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thank you.</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; (As interpreted.)&nbsp; We are going back to the American journalist posing questions to the American President.&nbsp; This is going to be the last question, so please keep your question to just one item.</p>



<p>PRESIDENT BIDEN:&nbsp; Seung Min, with the Washington Post.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Mr. President.&nbsp; You are here in the region to promote the United States economic cooperation with South Korea and Japan.&nbsp; But the two countries have been locked in a trade dispute, on top of their bilateral relationship deteriorating for a number of reasons over in recent years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, what kind of a role would the United States play here in resolving those and other disputes so that your administration can further your goal of &#8212; of bolstering your economic alliance with the region?</p>



<p>And then I have a question for President Yoon.</p>



<p>PRESIDENT BIDEN:&nbsp; You only get one.&nbsp; (Laughter.)</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One per leader.</p>



<p>PRESIDENT BIDEN:&nbsp; I&#8217;m protecting him.&nbsp; (Laughter.)</p>



<p>The answer is that we discussed that in generic terms.&nbsp; The fact is that I&#8217;ll be going from here to Tokyo and discussing this as well.</p>



<p>I think it&#8217;s critically important that we have a very close trilateral relationship, including economically as well as &#8212; as militarily.&nbsp; And I think you&#8217;ll see that there are ways to deal with some of the trade barriers that were placed &#8212; some of which, by the way, were placed by my predecessor, which we&#8217;re &#8212; we&#8217;re looking at very closely right now.&nbsp; So, I think there&#8217;s a lot of room to move.</p>



<p>In addition to that, if &#8212; you know, I think you covered the fact that I spend a lot of time with the ASEAN nations, as well as the Quartet.&nbsp; There&#8217;s &#8212; there&#8217;s a whole range of &#8212; things have changed.&nbsp; There is a sense among the democracies in the Pacific that there&#8217;s a need to cooperate much more closely &#8212; not just militarily, but in terms of economically and politically.</p>



<p>And so, we talked in &#8212; at some length about the need for us to make this larger than just the United States, Japan, and &#8212; and Korea but to the entire Pacific and the South Pacific and the Indo-Pacific.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I think this is an opportunity.&nbsp; You know, you&#8217;ve heard me say it a hundred times &#8212; I&#8217;m sorry to the American press to repeat it &#8212; but I really do think we&#8217;re at an inflection point in world history.&nbsp; Things are changing so rapidly.&nbsp; I think you&#8217;re seeing that &#8212; what you&#8217;re going to see more of is this is going to be competition between democracies and autocracies.&nbsp; And I mean that sincerely.&nbsp; And, unfortunately, I think I&#8217;m being proven to be correct &#8212; not just here, but around the world.</p>



<p>And again, we talked at length about &#8212; this is a &#8212; not only just regional, but it&#8217;s also a global alliance, in effect, of how we&#8217;re going to respond.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I don&#8217;t mean a formal written alliance.&nbsp; But, for example, if you notice, Korea and Japan have both stepped up in support of Ukraine.&nbsp; You find that in &#8212; the Quad is supporting Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, there&#8217;s a whole range of things that affect whether or not democracies can be sustained in the midst of this incredible change that is taking place.&nbsp; We both agreed that it could and should be and that, together, we can play a major part in having that done.</p>



<p>Thank you.&nbsp; Appreciate it.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your Cabinet nominees are overwhelmingly male.&nbsp; South Korea consistently ranks low among developed countries on professional advancement of women.&nbsp; And you, yourself, during your presidential campaign, proposed abolishing the Ministry of Gender Equality.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What role should a leading world economy like South Korea play in improving the representation and advancement of women?&nbsp; And what will you and your administration do to improve the state of gender equality in this country?</p>



<p>PRESIDENT YOON:&nbsp; (As interpreted.)&nbsp; If you look at the public officials sector, especially the ministers in the Cabinet, we really didn&#8217;t see a lot of women advancing to that position thus far.&nbsp; Probably in various regions, equal opportunities were not fully ensured for women.&nbsp; We have actually a quite short history of ensuring that.&nbsp; So, what we&#8217;re trying to do is to very actively ensure such opportunities for women.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; (As interpreted.)&nbsp; This concludes the joint press conference.&nbsp; The presidents of the two countries will leave the room first.</p>



<p>PRESIDENT BIDEN:&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; (As interpreted.)&nbsp; This concludes the joint press conference in the interest of time, and they have other schedules to attend to later on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, we would like to thank the journalists once again for their time here and also for constructive questions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thank you.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">The People&#8217;s House<br>Seoul, Republic of Korea</p>



<p>3:09 P.M. KST</p>



<p>PRESIDENT YOON:&nbsp; (As interpreted.)&nbsp; Mr. President, today we&#8217;re living in the era of economic security, where economy is security and vice versa.&nbsp; The transformation of the international trade order and the disruption of global supply chains are having a direct impact on the livelihood of our people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ROK-U.S. alliance should also move forward and adapt to this new era of economic security.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yesterday, Mr. President and I, together, visited what can be described as the &#8220;global epicenter&#8221; of cutting-edge semiconductor industry.&nbsp; There, I was able to feel the strength of our economic and technology alliance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We will continue our cooperation in strategic industries, such as microchips and EV batteries, in order to expand mutual investment and to attain our common goal, which is building a resilient supply chain.</p>



<p>And, Mr. President, our summit talks today will provide a valuable opportunity to further strengthen our cooperation and economic security, as well as to discuss ways to work together and align our policies to resolve many other pressing global challenges that we face together.&nbsp;</p>



<p>PRESIDENT BIDEN:&nbsp; Mr. President, thank you for your incredibly warm welcome.&nbsp; It’s wonderful to be back in the Republic of Korea.&nbsp; I&#8217;m honored to be making this visit less than two weeks since you’ve been inaugurated.&nbsp; And congratulations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mr. President, our alliances between our countries is built on shared sacrifice.&nbsp; And our joint commitment to the freedom of the Republic of Korea and our firm opposition to changing borders by force has flourished with decades of peace and cooperation.&nbsp; And today, with this visit, we&#8217;re taking the cooperation between our two countries to new heights.</p>



<p>For decades, our alliance has been a linchpin for regional peace and growth and prosperity, and it’s been vital to deterring attacks from the DPRK.&nbsp; And, today, our cooperation is essential to preserve the stability and global &#8212; on the global stage as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our two nations are working together to take on both the opportunities and the challenges of the moment: continuing to fight COVID-19, securing the supply chains, tackling the climate crisis, deepening our security cooperation to meet regional challenges, and writing the rules of the road to ensure the Indo-Pacific is a free and open area.</p>



<p>So, thank you again for the welcome, Mr. President.&nbsp; I’ve enjoyed our conversations and getting to spend some time with you.&nbsp; Matter of a fact, we spent so much time, we didn’t get a chance to see the rest of your people.</p>



<p>PRESIDENT YOON:&nbsp; (Laughs.)</p>



<p>PRESIDENT BIDEN:&nbsp; And I’m looking forward to continuing the great friendship between our two nations.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp;</p>

<p>President Yoon Suk Yeol welcomes President Joseph R. Biden to the Republic of Korea (ROK), marking the earliest meeting in a ROK President’s term in office with the President of the United States (U.S.). Founded in our shared sacrifice and honed by our deep security ties, the Alliance between the Republic of Korea and the United States continues to evolve and expand. The linchpin for peace and prosperity in the region, the Alliance has grown far beyond the Korean peninsula, reflecting the pivotal role of our countries as global leaders in democracy, economy, and technology. Faced with existential challenges like climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic, and growing threats to the rules-based international order, foremost among which is Russia’s further aggression against Ukraine, the Republic of Korea and the United States are unified in common determination to deepen and broaden our political, economic, security, and people-to-people ties.</p>



<p>The two Presidents deeply appreciate the recent accomplishments of the Alliance and pledge to continue building off of its rock solid foundation.</p>



<p><strong>The Linchpin for Peace and Prosperity</strong></p>



<p>President Yoon and President Biden reaffirm their mutual commitment to the defense of the Republic of Korea and the combined defense posture under the ROK-U.S. Mutual Defense Treaty. President Biden affirms the U.S. extended deterrence commitment to the ROK using the full range of U.S. defense capabilities, including nuclear, conventional, and missile defense capabilities. The two Presidents also agree to reactivate the high-level Extended Deterrence Strategy and Consultation Group at the earliest date. Both leaders commit to further strengthen deterrence by reinforcing combined defense posture, and reiterate commitment to a conditions-based transition of wartime operational control. With this in mind, and considering the evolving threat posed by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK), both leaders agree to initiate discussions to expand the scope and scale of combined military exercises and training on and around the Korean Peninsula. Both leaders also reaffirm the commitment of the U.S. to deploy strategic U.S. military assets in a timely and coordinated manner as necessary, as well as to enhance such measures and identify new or additional steps to reinforce deterrence in the face of DPRK destabilizing activities. In this vein, the United States and ROK will significantly expand cooperation to confront a range of cyber threats from the DPRK, including but not limited to, state-sponsored cyber-attacks.</p>



<p>President Yoon and President Biden reiterate their common goal of the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and agree to further strengthen the airtight coordination to this end. The two Presidents share the view that the DPRK’s nuclear program presents a grave threat not only to peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula but also the rest of Asia and the world. Both leaders condemn the DPRK’s escalatory ballistic missile tests this year, including multiple launches of intercontinental ballistic missiles, as clear violations of United Nations Security Council resolutions and reaffirm their joint commitment to work with the international community to urge the DPRK to abandon its weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs.Both leaders urge all UN Member States to fully implement all United Nations Security Council resolutions and also call on the DPRK to abide by its obligations under UN Security Council resolutions as well as its previous commitments and agreements.</p>



<p>President Yoon and President Biden emphasize that the path to dialogue remains open toward peaceful and diplomatic resolution with the DPRK and call on DPRK to return to negotiations. President Yoon outlined his vision to normalize inter-Korean relationship through an audacious plan aimed at a denuclearized and prosperous Korean peninsula and President Biden expresses his support for inter-Korean cooperation. Both leaders underscore the importance of ROK-U.S.-Japan trilateral cooperation for responding to the DPRK’s challenges, protecting shared security and prosperity, upholding common values, and bolstering the rules-based international order.</p>



<p>President Yoon and President Biden express grave concern over the human rights situation in the DPRK. The two Presidents also reaffirm their commitment to facilitate the provision of humanitarian aid to the most vulnerable North Koreans. Both leaders express concern over the recent COVID-19 outbreak in the DPRK. The ROK and the U.S. are willing to work with the international community to provide assistance to the DPRK to combat the virus.</p>



<p><strong>A Strategic Economic and Technology Partnership</strong></p>



<p>President Yoon and President Biden recognize that the future of the Alliance will be defined by common efforts to address 21<sup>st</sup> century challenges. In this vein, the two Presidents pledge to deepen and broaden cooperation on critical and emerging technologies, and cyber security. Both leaders also pledge to develop, use, and advance technologies in line with shared democratic principles and universal values.</p>



<p>President Yoon and President Biden recognize the importance of deepening cooperation on economic and energy security, which are critical to safeguarding our prosperity, shared security, and collective interests. To support these initiatives, the two Presidents will direct respective National Security Councils to launch an economic security dialogue aimed to align the bureaucratic and policy approaches between the two governments.</p>



<p>Fully recognizing that scientists, researchers, and engineers of the ROK and the U.S. are among the most innovative in the world, the two Presidents agree to leverage this comparative advantage to enhance public and private cooperation to protect and promote critical and emerging technologies, including leading-edge semiconductors, eco-friendly EV batteries, Artificial Intelligence, quantum technology, biotechnology, biomanufacturing, and autonomous robotics. Moreover, the two Presidents also reaffirm their active support for people-to-people exchanges between experts in these fields. To this end, the two Presidents agree to work together to enhance partnership on these critical and emerging technologies in both countries through the promotion of investment as well as research and development cooperation. Recognizing the growing potential for ROK-U.S. cooperation in the defense industry, the two leaders agree to strengthen partnerships in areas such as defense sector supply chain, joint development and manufacturing, including beginning discussions on a Reciprocal Defense Procurement agreement.</p>



<p>Secure, sustainable, and resilient global supply chains are foundational to these efforts. Building upon international cooperation fostered by the U.S.-led Summit on Global Supply Chain Resilience, and by working closely together in the upcoming Ministerial-level summit, the two Presidents agree to continue working together to tackle immediate and long-term challenges in the supply chain ecosystem. Both leaders agree to strengthen the resiliency and diversity of these networks including by cooperating on early warning systems to detect and address potential supply chain disruptions and working together to address sourcing and processing of critical minerals. The two Presidents also agree to establish a regular ministerial-level Supply Chain and Commercial Dialogue to discuss promotion of resilient supply chains of key products, including semiconductors, batteries, and critical minerals. Both leaders also agree to enhance cooperation between our foreign investment screening and export control authorities related to critical technologies, which is necessary to prevent the use of advanced technologies to undermine our national and economic security.</p>



<p>Recognizing the importance of energy security as well as commitment to address climate change given the rapid increase of volatility in the global energy market as a result of Russia’s further aggression against Ukraine, the two Presidents will work to strengthen joint collaboration in securing energy supply chains that include fossil fuels, and enriched uranium, acknowledging that true energy security means rapidly deploying clean energy technology and working to decrease our dependence on fossil fuels.</p>



<p>The two leaders recognize the importance of nuclear energy as a critical and reliable source of carbon-free electricity, an important element to grow our clean energy economy, and an integral part of enhancing global energy security. The two leaders commit to greater nuclear energy collaboration and accelerating the development and global deployment of advanced reactors and small modular reactors by jointly using export promotion and capacity building tools, and building a more resilient nuclear supply chain. The two Presidents reaffirm that both countries will engage in global civil-nuclear cooperation in accordance with the highest standards of nuclear nonproliferation, including the IAEA Additional Protocol as the standard for both international safeguards and for nuclear supply arrangements. Acknowledging the shared goals of deepening strategic ties, while respecting each country’s intellectual investments, both leaders commit to using tools such as the ROK-U.S. Memorandum of Understanding on Nuclear Technology Transfer and Export Cooperation to provide a solid foundation for strengthened cooperation in the U.S., ROK and overseas nuclear markets and the High-Level Bilateral Commission, to further cooperation for spent fuel management, nuclear export promotion, assured fuel supply and nuclear security. The U.S. welcomes the ROK’s decision to join the U.S.-led Foundational Infrastructure for Responsible Use of Small Modular Reactor Technology (FIRST) program.</p>



<p>President Yoon and President Biden commit to strengthening the ROK-U.S. alliance across all sectors of space cooperation. Building on the ROK’s previous commitment to participate in the Artemis program, the two Presidents agreed to foster joint research in space exploration and to support the ROK’s development of the Korean Positioning System (KPS). Both leaders agree to hold “the 3<sup>rd</sup> U.S.-ROK Civil Space Dialogue” by the end of the year, and to strengthen cooperation on the two countries space industries. They also commit to continue cooperation to ensure a safe, secure, and sustainable space environment including through the bilateral space policy dialogue and committed to strengthen defense space partnerships including through joint exercises.</p>



<p>President Yoon and President Biden agree that the Korea-U.S. Free Trade Agreement (KORUS), which celebrated its 10<sup>th</sup> anniversary this year, remains the foundation of our economic relationship. To promote sustainable growth and financial stability, including orderly and well-functioning foreign exchange markets, the two Presidents recognize the need to consult closely on foreign exchange market developments. The two Presidents share common values and an essential interest in fair, market-based competition and commit to work together to address market distorting practices.</p>



<p><strong>Global </strong><strong>Comprehensive Strategic Alliance: Beyond the Korean Peninsula</strong></p>



<p>Faced with increasingly complex global challenges including the threats posed by climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic, President Yoon laid out the ROK’s initiative for a global pivotal state that envisions a heightened role in advancing freedom, peace, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond. The two Presidents reaffirm their commitments to a global comprehensive strategic alliance firmly rooted in the shared values of promoting democracy and the rules-based international order, fighting corruption, and advancing human rights. President Biden appreciated President Yoon’s initiative to embrace greater regional and global responsibilities, and enthusiastically welcome the ROK taking a leadership role in <em>the Summit for Democracy </em>process.</p>



<p>Acknowledging the existential threat posed by climate change, President Yoon and President Biden reaffirm their commitments to their announced nationally determined contributions under the Paris Agreement including the 2030 greenhouse gas reduction targets and 2050 net zero emission goals with strong efforts to align policies across sectors. The two Presidents also agree to enhance cooperation to address methane emissions globally, recognizing the importance of the Global Methane Pledge and rapid global action needed to address methane. The two Presidents also decide to strengthen cooperation in clean energy fields such as hydrogen, clean shipping, accelerated deployment of zero-emissions vehicles (ZEVs) and aligning international financial flows with global net zero emissions by 2050 and deep reductions in the 2020s.</p>



<p>President Yoon and President Biden pledge to support in strengthening multilateral efforts to prevent, prepare, and respond to infectious disease threats. President Yoon underscored President Biden’s leadership in convening the Global COVID-19 Summit in May 2022, and President Biden appreciated President Yoon’s active participation and ROK’s announced pledges, including funding for the Act-Accelerator to combat COVID-19 and support for the Financial Intermediary Fund for pandemic preparedness and global health security at the World Bank. President Biden welcomes the ROK’s decision to host a Global Health Security Agenda ministerial meeting this Fall and establish a GHS coordinating office for global and regional sustainable health security in Seoul. Our countries will also increase efforts bilaterally and in multilateral fora to promote biosafety and biosecurity norms. The U.S. and ROK will also strengthen health systems and build on successful health sector collaboration to accelerate cooperation and innovation in cancer research, cutting edge cancer treatments, mental health research, early detection, and treatment of mental health disorders.</p>



<p>President Yoon and President Biden highlight their shared belief in the extraordinary benefits afforded by an open, free, global, interoperable, reliable, and secure Internet. To combat the rising threats posed by digital authoritarianism, they committed to defend human rights and foster an open “network of networks” that ensures the free flow of information globally. To achieve this, the ROK is ready to join the U.S. in endorsing <em>the Declaration for the Future of the Internet</em>. The two Presidents also reaffirm the need to ensure that the Internet continues to play a positive role in promoting equity, equality and safety for women and girls in both our societies. To this end, the U.S. and the ROK joined the Global Partnership for Action on Gender-Based Online Harassment and Abuse as founding members. Recognizing the importance of telecommunications security and vendor diversity, the leaders also commit to work together to develop open, transparent, and secure 5G and 6G network devices and architectures using Open-RAN approaches, both at home and abroad.</p>



<p>President Yoon and President Biden will continue to deepen ROK-U.S. cooperation on regional and international cyber policy, including cooperation on deterring cyber adversaries, cybersecurity of critical infrastructure, combatting cybercrime and associated money laundering, securing cryptocurrency and blockchain applications, capacity building, cyber exercises, information sharing, military-to-military cyber cooperation, and other international security issues in cyberspace.</p>



<p>President Yoon and President Biden oppose all activities that undermine, destabilize, or threaten the rules-based international order and stand together with the international community in condemning Russia’s unprovoked further aggression against Ukraine. Both countries, alongside other international partners, have responded resolutely to this clear violation of international law, by imposing their own financial sanctions and export controls against Russia and Russian entities, along with the vital provision of humanitarian aid to Ukraine. Both leaders affirm that they will ensure the effective implementation of their country’s respective measures to deter further Russian aggression and maintain our commitment to the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity.</p>



<p>The two Presidents recognize the importance of maintaining a free and open Indo-Pacific that is prosperous and peaceful, and agree to strengthen mutual cooperation across the region. In this regard, President Biden shares his support for President Yoon’s initiative to formulate ROK’s own Indo-Pacific strategy framework. President Yoon also welcomed the U.S. Indo-Pacific Strategy. The two Presidents commit to cooperate closely through the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF), based on the principles of openness, transparency, and inclusiveness. Both leaders agree to work together to develop a comprehensive IPEF that will deepen economic engagement on priority issues, including the digital economy, resilient supply chains, clean energy, and other priorities geared toward promoting sustainable economic growth.</p>



<p>President Yoon and President Biden also reaffirm their strong support for ASEAN centrality and the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific. The two Presidents commit to increase cooperation with Southeast Asia and the Pacific Island Countries to promote sustainable development, energy security, and high-quality, transparent investment, including in quality infrastructure. President Biden welcomes President Yoon’s interest in the Quad, and noted complementary ROK strengths including tackling the pandemic, fighting climate change and producing critical technologies. The two leaders also agree to cooperate on infrastructure financing, including digital infrastructure, in third countries. The two Presidents emphasize the importance of ROK-U.S.- Japan trilateral cooperation to effectively address common economic challenges.</p>



<p>President Yoon and President Biden reaffirm their commitment to maintain peace and stability, lawful unimpeded commerce, and respect for international law including freedom of navigation and overflight and other lawful use of the seas, including in the South China Sea and beyond. The two Presidents reiterate the importance of preserving peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait as an essential element in security and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region. Sharing our mutual concerns regarding human rights situations in the Indo-Pacific region, both leaders commit to promote human rights and rule of law globally. The two Presidents resolutely condemn the coup in Myanmar and the military’s brutal attacks on civilians, and commit to press for the immediate cessation of violence, the release of those who are detained, unfettered countrywide humanitarian access, and a swift return to democracy. The two Presidents call on all nations to join us in providing safe haven to Burmese nationals and in prohibiting arms sales to Myanmar.</p>



<p>President Yoon and President Biden share the view that the Alliance has matured into a deep and comprehensive strategic relationship. Through our close ties between the two dynamic populations, extensive economic and investment links, and commitment to democracy, human rights, and the rules-based international order, the ROK and the U.S. are charting a path toward a relationship that is capable of meeting any challenge and seizing all the opportunities presented before us. President Yoon and President Biden jointly recognize the importance of our shared commitments and pledge to work tirelessly to broaden and deepen our ties to position us to succeed in a rapidly changing world.</p>



<p>President Biden expressed his gratitude for President Yoon’s warm hospitality and extended an invitation for President Yoon to visit Washington at a time of mutual convenience.</p>
