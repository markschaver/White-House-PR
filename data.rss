<p class="has-text-align-center">Joint Base Andrews<br>Prince George’s County, Maryland</p>



<p>5:19 P.M. EDT<br><br>     THE PRESIDENT:  Thanks for coming up.  That’s going to be a cool plant. </p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. President, you talked a lot about climate being an emergency today.&nbsp; Why not just declare it an emergency?</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Because I’m running into traps on the totality of the authority I have.&nbsp; I will make that decision soon.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And what would be the ramifications of doing it?&nbsp; Do you think you&#8217;d be able to do more?</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Well, I think I can do more, unless the Congress acts.&nbsp; In the meantime, I can do more, because not enough is being done now.&nbsp; And so, there&#8217;s still discussions going on about whether or not there will be some action on my climate plan.&nbsp; And that’s &#8212; I&#8217;m told that&#8217;s in play.&nbsp; And we&#8217;ll see.&nbsp; We&#8217;ll see what happens.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you still have hopes for a legislative agreement with Senator Manchin on climate?</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; I&#8217;ve not spoken to Senator Manchin.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, no?&nbsp; No hopes for one?</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; I do not have an agreement with Senator Manchin.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. President, do you think it&#8217;s a good idea for Speaker Pelosi to travel to Taiwan this summer?&nbsp;</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Well, I &#8212; I think that &#8212; the military thinks it’s not a good idea right now, but I don&#8217;t know what the status of it is.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And what about declaring a public health emergency for abortion, sir?&nbsp; Where does that stand?</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Well, that&#8217;s in consideration as well.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still?&nbsp; That’s still under consideration?&nbsp;</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Okay &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, are you pleased with your administration&#8217;s response to monkeypox?&nbsp; Senator Patty Murray today expressed concern to the HHS.</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Well, I’ve &#8212; I think we should be doing all that we possibly can.&nbsp; And I&#8217;m getting a report on that on Friday.</p>



<p>Okay?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you expect to talk to President Xi soon, sir?&nbsp;</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; I think I&#8217;ll be talking to President Xi within the next 10 days.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What&#8217;s your take on the next steps for COVID, Mr. President?&nbsp; Cases are going up.&nbsp; What should the country be doing right now?</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Getting vaccinated.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And for those who aren&#8217;t?</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; They’ve got a problem.&nbsp; It’s not &#8212; it’s not in their interest or the public’s interest not to get vaccinated.&nbsp; We have the capacity to control it.&nbsp; They should get vaccinated now.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And you said you’re going to speak to President Xi in the next 10 days.</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; I didn’t say that.&nbsp; I said I expect to.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Expect to.&nbsp; What will you tell him about tariffs?&nbsp;</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; I&#8217;ll tell him to have a good day.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; (Laughs.)</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Laughs.)&nbsp; What about the student loan decision, sir?&nbsp; People have said that you&#8217;re going to make that decision by the end of August.&nbsp; Where does that stand at this point?</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; By the end of August.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thank you so much.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Brayton Point Power Station<br>Somerset, Massachusetts</p>



<p>2:43 P.M. EDT</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.&nbsp; And thank you for your patience.&nbsp; You’ve been sitting out here.&nbsp; Appreciate &#8212; please, have a seat, if you have one.</p>



<p>Well, hello, Massachusetts.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; It’s an honor to be with your outstanding members of Congress today: Senator Ed Markey.&nbsp; Ed?&nbsp; Where’s &#8212; there you go.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Senator Elizabeth Warren.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Congressman Auchincloss &#8212; -oss.&nbsp; Where is she?&nbsp; There you go, Jake.&nbsp; Bill Keating &#8212; Congressman.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>And your great former members and one of my dearest friends, John Kerry, who’s doing a great job leading our international &#8212; (applause) &#8212; Special Presidential Envoy on Climate, traveling the world and talking with an awful lot of people he’s talking into moving more than they’ve been doing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And another great Massachusetts nata- &#8212; native, Gina McCarthy.&nbsp; Gina?&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; There she is.&nbsp; My National Climate Advisor is leading our climate efforts here at home.</p>



<p>It’s an honor to be joined by your neighbor by &#8212; your neighbor from Rhode Island.&nbsp; He’s not a bad guy at all.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; I live in his house.&nbsp; Sheldon Whitehouse &#8212; a great champion &#8212; (applause) &#8212; a great champion of the environment.&nbsp; And he’d been banging away at it.</p>



<p>I come here today with a message: As President, I have a responsibility to act with urgency and resolve when our nation faces clear and present danger.&nbsp; And that’s what climate change is about.&nbsp; It is literally, not figuratively, a clear and present danger.</p>



<p>The health of our citizens and our communities is literally at stake.</p>



<p>The U.N.’s leading international climate scientists called the latest climate report nothing less than, quote, “code red for humanity.”&nbsp; Let me say it again: “Code red for humanity.”&nbsp; It’s not a group of political official &#8212; elected officials.&nbsp; These are the scientists.</p>



<p>We see here in America, in red states and blue states, extreme weather events costing $145 billion &#8212; $145 billion in damages just last year &#8212; more powerful and destructive hurricanes and tornadoes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I’ve flown over the vast majority of them out west and down in Louisiana, all across America.&nbsp; It’s a &#8212; it’s amazing to see.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ravaging hundred-year-old droughts occurring every few years instead of every hundred years.&nbsp; Wildfires out west that have burned and destroyed more than 5 million acres &#8212; everything in its path.&nbsp; That is more land than the entire state of New Jersey, from New York down to the tip of Delaware.&nbsp; It’s amazing.&nbsp; Five million acres.</p>



<p>Our national security is at stake as well.&nbsp; Extreme weather is already damaging our military installations here in the States.&nbsp; And our economy is at risk.&nbsp; So we have to act.</p>



<p>Extreme weather disrupts supply chains, causing delays and shortages for consumers and businesses.</p>



<p>Climate change is literally an existential threat to our nation and to the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So my message today is this: Since Congress is not acting as it should &#8212; and these guys here are, but we’re not getting many Republican votes &#8212; this is an emergency. &nbsp;An emergency.&nbsp; And I will &#8212; I will look at it that way.</p>



<p>I said last week and I’ll say it again loud and clear: As President, I’ll use my executive powers to combat climate &#8212; the climate crisis in the absence of congressional actions, notwithstanding their incredible action.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the coming days, my administration will announce the executive actions we have developed to combat this emergency. &nbsp;We need to act.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But just take a look around: Right now, 100 million Americans are under heat alert &#8212; 100 million Americans.&nbsp; Ninety communities across America set records for high temperatures just this year, including here in New England as we speak.</p>



<p>And, by the way, records have been set in the Arctic and the Antarctic, with temperatures that are just unbelievable, melting the permafrost. &nbsp;And it’s astounding the damage that’s being done.</p>



<p>And this crisis impacts every aspect of our everyday life.&nbsp; That’s why today I’m making the largest investment ever &#8212; $2.3 billion &#8212; to help communities across the country build infrastructure that is designed to withstand the full range of disasters we’ve been seeing up to today -– extreme heat, drought, flooding, hurricanes, tornadoes.</p>



<p>Right now, there are millions of people suffering from extreme heat at home.&nbsp; So my team is also working with the states to deploy $385 million right now.</p>



<p>For the first time, states will be able to use federal funds to pay for air conditioners in homes, set up community cooling centers in schools where people can get through these extreme heat crises.&nbsp; And I mean people &#8212; and crises that are 100 to 117 degrees.</p>



<p>An Infrastructure Law that your members of Congress have delivered includes $3.1 billion to weatherize homes and make them more energy efficient, which will lower energy cost while keeping America cool in the summer and warm in the winter, and not using too much energy.</p>



<p>And my Department of Labor, led by a guy named <em>Marty Walsh &#8212;</em> (said in Boston accent) &#8212; he talks funny, but he’s a hell of a guy.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; But all kidding aside, Marty was a great mayor, and I know &#8212; I know he knows how to get a job done.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And he’s doing two things for me:</p>



<p>First of all, as Secretary of Labor, he’s developing the first-ever workplace standards for extreme heat, saying, under these cond- &#8212; under these conditions, if it hits this pr- &#8212; you cannot do the following &#8212; you cannot ask people to do a certain thing.</p>



<p>Second, he’s sending folks out from the Labor Department to make sure we hold workplaces and &#8212; to those standards that are being set.&nbsp; They’ve already completed over 500 heat-related inspections of workplaces across 43 states.&nbsp; At the end of the day, it’s going to save lives.</p>



<p>Now, let me tell you why we’re here at Brayton Point.&nbsp; Five years ago, this towering power plant that once stood with cooling towers 500 feet high closed down.&nbsp; The coal plant at Brayton Point was the largest of its kind in New England &#8212; 1,500 megawatts of power, enough to power one in five Massachusetts homes and businesses.</p>



<p>For over 50 years, this plant supported this region’s economy through their electrici- &#8212; the electricity they supplied, the good jobs they provided, and the local taxes they paid.</p>



<p>But the plant, like many others around the country, had another legacy: one of toxins, smog, greenhouse gas emissions, the kind of pollution that contributed to the climate emergency we now face today.</p>



<p>Gina McCarthy, a former regulator in Massachusetts, was telling me on the way up how folks used to get a rag out and wipe the gunk off of their car’s windshields in the morning just to be able to drive &#8212; not very much unlike where I grew up in a place called Claymont, Delaware &#8212; which has more oil refineries than Houston, Texas, had in its region &#8212; just across the line in Pennsylvania.  And all the prevailing winds were our way.<br><br>I just lived up the road.  I just &#8212; in an apartment complex when we moved to Delaware.  And just up the road was a little school I went to, Holy Rosary grade school.  And because it was a four-lane highway that was accessible, my mother drove us and &#8212; rather than us be able to walk.<br><br>And guess what?  The first frost, you knew what was happening.  You had to put on your windshield wipers to get, literally, the oil slick off the window.  That’s why I and so damn many other people I grew up [with] have cancer and why can- &#8212; for the longest time, Delaware had the highest cancer rate in the nation.</p>



<p>But that’s the past, and we’re going to get &#8212; we’re going to build a different future with one &#8212; one with clean energy, good-paying jobs.</p>



<p>Just 15 years ago, America generated more than half its electricity from coal &#8212; coal-fired plants.&nbsp; Today, that’s down to 20 percent because there’s a big transition happening.</p>



<p>Many of these fossil fuel plants are becoming sites for new clean energy construction.&nbsp; Others are switching to new, clean technologies.</p>



<p>Look at Brayton Point.&nbsp; Today, Brayton is one of the frontiers &#8212; on the frontier of clean energy in America.&nbsp; On this site, they’ll manufacture four hun- &#8212; 248 miles of high-tech, heavy-duty cables.&nbsp; Those specialized, subsea cables are necessary to tie offshore wind farms to the existing grid.</p>



<p>Manufacturing these cables will mean good-paying jobs for 250 workers &#8212; as many workers as the old plant &#8212; power plant had at its peak.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And the port &#8212; (applause) &#8212; the port here, 34 feet deep, was used to carry coal into the power plant.&nbsp; Now we’re going to use that same port to carry components of &#8212; for wind power into the sea.</p>



<p>The converter station here and the substation nearby are the assets that move energy across the power lines.</p>



<p>They’ll now move clean electricity generated offshore by the wind &#8212; (applause) &#8212; enough power to power hundreds of thousands of homes onto the grid &#8212; putting old assets to work delivering clean energy. &nbsp;This didn’t happen by accident.&nbsp; It happened because we believed and invested in America’s innovation and ingenuity.</p>



<p>One of the companies investing in the factory here joined me at the White House this month.&nbsp; Vineyard Winds, whose CEO told me about the ground-breaking project labor agreements they’ve negotiated, would create good-paying union jobs.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>And I want to compliment Congressman Bill Keating for his work in this area.</p>



<p>I’m also proud to point out that my administration approved the first commercial project for offshore wind in America, which is being constructed by Vineyard Winds.</p>



<p>Folks, elsewhere in the country, we are pr- &#8212; we are propelling retrofits and ensuring that even where fossil fuel plant retires, they still have a role in powering the future.</p>



<p>In Illinois, for example, the state has launched a broad effort to invest in converting old power plants to solar farms, led by Governor Pritzker.</p>



<p>In California, the IBEW members have helped turn a former oil plant into the world’s largest battery storage facility &#8212; the world’s largest facility.</p>



<p>In Wyoming, innovators are chosen to &#8212; a retiring plant as the next site for the next-generation nuclear plant.</p>



<p>And my administr- &#8212; my administration is a partner in that progress, driving federal resources and funding to the communities that have powered this country for generations.&nbsp; And that’s why they need to be taken care of as well.</p>



<p>I want to thank Cecil Roberts, a friend and President of United Mine Workers of America, and so many other labor leaders who worked with &#8212; worked with on these initiatives.</p>



<p>Since I took office, we’ve invested more than $4 billion in federal funding to the 25 hardest-hit coal communities in the country, from West Virginia, to Kentucky, to Wyoming, to New Mexico.</p>



<p>Through the Infrastructure Law, we’re investing in clean hydrogen, nuclear, and carbon capture with the largest grid investment in American history.</p>



<p>We’ve secured $16 billion to clean up abandoned mines and wells, protecting thousands of communities from toxins and waste, particularly methane.  And we still &#8212; and we’re going to seal leaking methane pollution &#8212; an incredibly power[ful] greenhouse gas that’s 40 times more dangerous to the environment than carbon dioxide.  (Applause.)</p>



<p>And, folks, with American leadership back on climate, I was able to bring more world leaders together than &#8212; we got 100 nations together to agree that &#8212; at the major conference in Glasgow, England &#8212; I mean, Scotland &#8212; to change the emissions policies we had.</p>



<p>We’ve made real progress, but there is an enormous task ahead.&nbsp; We have to keep retaining and recruiting building trades and union electricians for jobs in wind, solar, hydrogen, nuclear, creating even more and better jobs.</p>



<p>We have to revitalize communities, especially those fence-line communities that are smothered by the legacy of pollution.</p>



<p>We have to outcompete China and in the world, and make these technologies here in the United States &#8212; not have to import them.</p>



<p>Folks, when I think about climate change &#8212; and I’ve been saying this for three years &#8212; I think jobs.&nbsp; Climate change, I think jobs.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>Almost 100 wind turbines going up off the coasts of Massachusetts and Rhode Island with ground broken and work underway.</p>



<p>Jobs manufacturing 2,500-ton steel foundations that anchor these offshore wind farms to the sea’s floor. &nbsp;Jobs manufacturing a Jones Act vessel in Texas to service these offshore wind farms.</p>



<p>We’re going to make sure that the ocean is open for the clean energy of our future, and everything we can do &#8212; give a green light to wind power on the Atlantic coast, where my predecessor’s actions only created confusion.</p>



<p>And today we begin the process to develop wind power in the Gulf of Mexico as well for the first time.&nbsp; A real opportunity to power millions of additional homes from wind.</p>



<p>Let’s clear the way &#8212; let’s clear the way for clean energy and connect these projects to the grid.</p>



<p>I’ve directed my administration to clear every federal hurdle and streamline federal permitting that brings these clean energy projects online right now and right away.&nbsp; And some of you have already come up and talked to me about that.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>And while so many governors and mayors have been strong partners in this fight to tackle climate change, we need all governors and mayors.&nbsp; We need public utility commissioners and state agency heads.&nbsp; We need electric utilities and developers to stand up and be part of the solution.&nbsp; Don’t be a road block.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>You all have a duty right now to our economy, to our competitiveness in the world, to the young people in this nation, and to future generations &#8212; and that sounds like hyperbole but it’s not; it’s real &#8212; to act boldly on climate.</p>



<p>And so does Congress, which &#8212; notwithstanding the leadership of the men and women that are here today &#8212; has failed in this duty.&nbsp; Not a single Republican in Congress stepped up to support my climate plan.&nbsp; Not one.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, let me be clear: Climate change is an emergency.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And in the coming weeks, I’m going to use the power I have as President to turn these words into formal, official government actions through the appropriate proclamations, executive orders, and regulatory power that a President possesses.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>And when it comes to fighting the climate change &#8212; climate change, I will not take no for an answer.&nbsp; I will do everything in my power to clean our air and water, protect our people’s health, to win the clean energy future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This, again, sounds like hyperbole, but our children and grandchildren are counting on us.&nbsp; Not a joke.&nbsp; Not a joke.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>If we don&#8217;t keep it below 1.5 degrees Centigrade, we lose it all.&nbsp; We don&#8217;t get to turn it around.&nbsp; And the world is counting on us.&nbsp; And this is the United States of America.&nbsp; When we put our hearts and minds to it, there&#8217;s not a single thing beyond our capacity &#8212; I mean it &#8212; when we act together.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And of all things we should be acting together on, it’s climate. &nbsp;It’s climate.</p>



<p>And, by the way, my dear mother &#8212; God rest her soul &#8212; used to say, “Joey, out of everything bad, something good will come if you look hard enough.”&nbsp; Look what&#8217;s happening.&nbsp; We&#8217;re going to be able to create as many or more good-paying jobs.&nbsp; We&#8217;re going to make environments where people live safer.&nbsp; We&#8217;re going to make the clean &#8212; the air safer.&nbsp; I really mean it.&nbsp; We have an opportunity here.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I’ll bet you when you see what&#8217;s happened here in this cable construction here &#8212; manufacturing &#8212; and you go back and ask all the people who grew up in this beautiful place what they’d rather have: Do they want the plant back with everything it had, or what you&#8217;re going to have?&nbsp; I will be dumbfounded if you find anybody, other than for pure sentimental reasons, saying, “I&#8217;d rather have the coal plant.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>I&#8217;ll end by telling you another quick story.&nbsp; When we moved from Scranton &#8212; when coal died in Scranton, everything died in Scranton.&nbsp; And my dad wasn&#8217;t a coal miner.&nbsp; My &#8212; my great &#8212; my great-grandfather was a mining engineer.&nbsp; But my dad was in sales, and there was no work.&nbsp; So we left to go down to Delaware, where I told you where those oil plants were.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But I remember driving home &#8212; when you take the trolley in Scranton, going out North Washington and Adams Avenues. &nbsp;Within 15 blocks &#8212; we didn&#8217;t live in the neighborhood &#8212; among the most prestigious neighborhood in the region, in the &#8212; in the town where the Scrantons and other good, decent people lived, there was a pla- &#8212; you&#8217;d go by a wall that &#8212; my recollection is it was somewhere between 15 and 18 feet tall.&nbsp; And it went for the &#8212; essentially, a city block.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And you could see the coal piled up to the very top of the wall from inside.&nbsp; It was a coal-fired plant.&nbsp; A coal-fired plant.&nbsp; And all of that &#8212; all of the negative impacts of breathing that coal, the dust were effecting everybody.&nbsp; But at the time, people didn&#8217;t know it and there wasn&#8217;t any alternative.</p>



<p>Folks, we have no excuse now.&nbsp; We know it.&nbsp; There are answers for it.&nbsp; We can make things better in terms of jobs.&nbsp; We can make things better in terms of the environment.&nbsp; We can make things better for families overall.&nbsp; So I&#8217;m looking forward to this movement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thank you, thank you, thank you.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; May God bless you all.&nbsp; And may God protect our troops.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>

JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Hi, everyone.&nbsp; It’s is a short flight, so I’m going to be really quick at the top here.<br><br>Today, the President is headed to Somerset, Massachusetts, to reiterate that climate change is an emergency.&nbsp; He will make clear that since Congress is not acting on that emergency, he will.<br><br>While there, the President will visit an old, coal-fired power plant in Brayton Point that is becoming a manufacturing hub for undersea cables that will support Massachusetts’s booming offshore wind industry.</p>



<p>The President will be joined by his National Climate Advisor, Gina McCarthy, who is standing right next to me, and Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry &#8212; both Massachusetts natives.<br><br>He will also be joined by Senator Ed Markey, Senator Elizabeth <s>Warner</s> [Warren], Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Congressman Jake Auchincloss, and Congressman Bill Keating.</p>



<p>With that, I am incredibly excited to welcome National Climate Advisor Gina McCarthy, who leads our climate efforts here at home, to talk more about the climate actions the President will be taking today.</p>



<p><br>Gina, it’s all yours.&nbsp; I don’t know if you want to &#8212; you good?<br><br>ADVISOR MCCARTHY:&nbsp; Oh, thank you.&nbsp; Well, first of all, as we now know, the President is going to Brayton Point, which is in Somerset.&nbsp; I would point out that that&#8217;s one of the oldest and largest coal-fired power plants that was in New England, and it closed back in 2017.<br><br>And the reason why we&#8217;re going today is because it really shows that you can turn an old power plant into something new.<br><br>This is about transforming it into a clean manufacturing hub.&nbsp; It is a company that is going to be actually manufacturing cable that connects those offshore wind turbines and keeps them solid and connects them to the grid.<br><br>So it is going to end up with the same kind of workforce as you would have had in the coal facility.&nbsp; And this is one of a number of coal units that are actually transforming themselves.&nbsp; When coal goes out, they&#8217;re beginning to invest in a clean energy future.<br><br>You’ve seen one in California that&#8217;s now focused on battery manufacturing.&nbsp; You&#8217;re going to see one in Wyoming that&#8217;s actually moving forward with &#8212; with a new-generation nuclear.&nbsp; And so there&#8217;s a lot going on.&nbsp; But I think it&#8217;s an indication that the President is really embracing and working with the private sector to actually have people understand that we are living in the beginning of the clean energy future.&nbsp; And we need to keep moving that forward.<br><br>And one of the actions that the President is going to talk about is a simple recognition that climate change is an emergency.&nbsp; And he&#8217;s going to indicate that, over the next few weeks, the White House and he are going to come out with executive actions that actually put some definition and some plans around that, because we&#8217;re not ready to give up on our strong goals; we&#8217;re ready to double down to make sure we get those.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And while it&#8217;s disappointing that Congress couldn&#8217;t get it over the finish line, that in no way precludes the President from using the full range of his executive authorities to get us where we need to go.<br><br>And I think the last thing that I would mention is: At the event today at Brayton Point, for good reason, we&#8217;re going to be talking about investments in heat to ensure that people can stay safe.<br><br>There&#8217;s about 100 million-plus people in the world right now that are experiencing tremendous amounts of heat, which is life threatening to so many, particularly our senior citizens.  And heat is actually talked about as the “silent killer” in climate change.  It actually impacts more human beings than all other climate impacts combined.<br><br>And so, right &#8212; the President is going to announce some new investments to allow states to be more prepared and resilient in the face of the heat and to, frankly, save lives, because that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s going to take.<br><br>So you&#8217;re going to be looking at an investment from FEMA that&#8217;s going to be over $2 billion.  And that $2 billion is going to <s>go to</s> [include] support[ing] states who want to build cooling centers so that folks have a place to go when the heat gets hot if they don&#8217;t have the air conditioning.  And, of course, many people don&#8217;t have the wherewithal to afford that or the energy costs that goes with it.<br><br>On &#8212; we&#8217;re also going to &#8212; the Housing and Urban Development Agency is also going to be putting out guidance so that people can easily access LIHEAP dollars, which we all know &#8212; if you lived in Massachusetts, you needed LIHEAP money for the heat.  Well, now we need LIHEAP money in the summer to keep us cool enough to actually st- &#8212; withstand these &#8212; this type of heat.<br><br>And so there&#8217;s resources in the area of 300-plus million [dollars] that &#8212; I think it&#8217;s 380 &#8212; that are going to be allocated to states who want to actually provide opportunities for air conditioning to be purchased through LIHEAP, as well as some reductions in energy costs so that consumers can afford it.<br><br>So those are the kind of efforts that we&#8217;re going to move forward with today and advance them.  And for obvious reasons, it&#8217;s a great backdrop.  It does sort of show off the work that we&#8217;re doing on offshore wind, which is really remarkable and way beyond our expectations.  And we see the same in electric vehicles.<br><br>And one of the best, I think, exciting parts for me in this job is that the President&#8217;s framing of moving forward with &#8212; with clean energy, using innovation and technology improvements, is &#8212; I think it gives us great hope, because the private sector is all in.<br><br>You know, when the President talked to the car industry about electric vehicles, they were the ones that said 100 percent by 2035.  We said 50 percent by 2030.  And then they put in well over $100 billion to start charging stations and electric battery manufacturing units, more &#8212; more manufacturing of electric vehicles.  And we found that the unions jumped on board, because these are the kind of increases in jobs, not decreases, that they were worried about.<br><br>So the framing of the President is really engaging the private sector significantly, because they know that a clean energy future is one that we actually need to provide stability and how we are going to grow our economy, but it&#8217;s also one in which they can actually find the cost-effective way for them to make money.  So once the private sector sees that sweetener in the pot, it&#8217;s great.  And I think that&#8217;s what they see.<br><br>When the President went forward on solar and issued an order under the Defense Production Act, just maybe a month or maybe six weeks ago, the first thing we heard the following week was $6 billion in money that the solar industry was going to put towards domestic manufacturing.  This is what happens when you lead.</p>



<p>And so I&#8217;m pretty excited about today.&nbsp; I know we&#8217;ll have a lot of work to do.&nbsp; And the President will be announcing executive authority efforts and actions moving forward.&nbsp; But we&#8217;ll work hard and we&#8217;ll make sure that we cannot just achieve the goals that the President laid out but actually exceed them.</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; All right.&nbsp; So let’s &#8212; yep, go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gina, can you address how the administration will meet your emissions targets if you don&#8217;t get legislation?&nbsp; I know you say there&#8217;s more executive action coming, but is that enough to meet the very ambitious goals that you set?</p>



<p>ADVISOR MCCARTHY:&nbsp; Well, we&#8217;re going to &#8212; I&#8217;d hope that you&#8217;d wait and see about the plans that we&#8217;re going to outline.&nbsp; But I also find that when &#8212; just in my experience, you know, when you set strong goals, when the private sector is engaged in spending their own money, there&#8217;s a lot &#8212; a lot of ability to accelerate beyond what the economists would anticipate at the moment.</p>



<p>And so while I would have loved to have seen lots more investment, we&#8217;re going to do everything we can to get a strategy in place that&#8217;s going to meet that goal.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you think the U.S. will meet that commitment, though?</p>



<p>ADVISOR MCCARTHY:&nbsp; That’s certainly what our intention is, yes.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What about &#8212; can you just walk us through what the thinking is for the administration about why you decided &#8212; why people decided not to declare a climate emergency this week?&nbsp; What was the thinking behind that, from your perspective?</p>



<p>ADVISOR MCCARTHY:&nbsp; I think that it was just a decision that we need to be thoughtful about this, and we want to outline actions, not just declare things.</p>



<p>So I think it was just important for the President to get his arms around the various threads of work that we can put together and lay them out in a way that he&#8217;s comfortable with.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And what do you see as the pros and cons of that decision, of declaring a climate emergency?</p>



<p>ADVISOR MCCARTHY:&nbsp; I think the President is making it very clear today that climate change is an emergency.&nbsp; And he&#8217;s making very clear today that while Congress didn&#8217;t move forward, that just is driving him to move forward with much clearer plans and much larger and more accelerated commitments.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does the President or the White House have any concerns about potential executive overreach in declaring a climate emergency?&nbsp; Is that one of the considerations?</p>



<p>ADVISOR MCCARTHY:&nbsp; I think the considerations are just that the President wants to make sure that we&#8217;re doing this right, that we&#8217;re laying it out, and that we have the time we need to get this work done.&nbsp; That&#8217;s all.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And to be sure, the &#8212; just to clarify, the White House does believe that an emergency declaration can be applied to climate as opposed to a singular natural event?</p>



<p>ADVISOR MCCARTHY:&nbsp; I would lea- &#8212; I really don&#8217;t want to answer that.&nbsp; All I know is that the President has broad authority in these areas, and he&#8217;s going to utilize the authorities he feels most appropriate.&nbsp; Okay?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May I ask a follow-up to Seung Min’s question?</p>



<p>ADVISOR MCCARTHY:&nbsp; I’m not a lawyer, so it’s best if I don’t do that.&nbsp; (Laughter.)</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I could follow up on Seung Min’s question about overreach: Are you thinking at all about the calculus for Senator Manchin and not wanting to potentially alienate him in case he does come back and support climate in a reconciliation package this fall?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or dur- &#8212; while the healthcare package also moves through the (inaudible).</p>



<p>ADVISOR MCCARTHY:&nbsp; You know, I do not know what Congress is anticipating now or any one senator.&nbsp; But the idea that the President is initiating here is to acknowledge the challenge.&nbsp; He talks a little bit about the science in his remarks to remind people that this is here and now, and he&#8217;s going to take action here and now.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you give any detail or a sense of how big the toolbox is when it comes to executive actions?&nbsp; You talked about how the President would be taking many in the coming weeks, but just what kind of &#8212; what&#8217;s the breadth of actions that we&#8217;re talking about here?</p>



<p>ADVISOR MCCARTHY:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have anything more de- &#8212; more detailed to announce to you right now.</p>



<p>Anything?&nbsp; All right.&nbsp; Thanks, everybody.&nbsp; I really</p>



<p>appreciate it.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; All right, I think we have to be in our seats by like, what &#8212; like &#8212; in, like, five, six minutes.</p>



<p>All right, I have another topper, and then I&#8217;ll take some questions from you guys.&nbsp; Give me one second.</p>



<p>So, last night, the Senate cleared a procedural hurdle on the CHIPS Act with a strong bipartisan vote: 16 Republicans voted in support of moving the bill forward.&nbsp; This brings up &#8212; this brings us one step closer to passing a package that will lower prices for Americans, strengthen our domestic supply chains and manufacturing power, and bolster our national security.</p>



<p>Importantly, as Speaker Pelosi noted this morning, this package includes strong guardrails.&nbsp; These guardrails would prevent companies from using CHIPS Act money for stock buybacks and from expanding certain types of semiconductor manufacturing in China.</p>



<p>These guardrails will ensure that these important investments stay in the United States.&nbsp; They will sharpen our competitive edge against China and protect our national security.</p>



<p>We look forward to getting a final bill to the President&#8217;s desk and signed as soon as possible.&nbsp; The stakes are high, and there&#8217;s no time to waste.</p>



<p>All right.&nbsp; Since we have a couple minutes, you guys have anything?&nbsp; Or &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I &#8212; there seems to be a lot of momentum, even among Republicans, building behind the same-sex marriage bill that passed the House yesterday.&nbsp; So I wanted to know the White House&#8217;s reaction to that momentum and if the President is going to get personally involved in pushing that bill across the finish line.</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; So, as you know, this is something that&#8217;s personal to the President.&nbsp; He has led on this issue for many years.&nbsp; I was just talking to him about this earlier.&nbsp; So he is a &#8212; as I said, a proud champion of the right for people to marry whom they love, and is grateful to see bipartisan support for that right.&nbsp; He believes it is nonnegotiable and that the Senate should act swiftly to get this to the President&#8217;s desk.&nbsp; He wants to get &#8212; he wants to sign this.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So we need this legislation, and we urge Congress to move as quickly as possible.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s &#8212; and it&#8217;s something the vast majority of the country support, just like they support restoring Roe, stopping a national abortion ban, and protecting the right to use contraception.</p>



<p>To your &#8212; to your specific question: Look, as I &#8212; as I&#8217;ve said many times before, and you hear me say this all the time, our office of Leg Affairs and other offices across the White House are constantly in touch with Congress.&nbsp; This is, again, a very important issue.&nbsp; He led on this issue as a senator.&nbsp; He led as an &#8212; on the issue as a Vice President, and he&#8217;s going to continue to do so as President.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just &#8212; Politico reported last night that the White House &#8212; top aides in the White House were growing more comfortable with declaring a public health emergency &#8212; sort of a much more narrow version of it &#8212; when it came to abortion access.&nbsp; And I wonder if you could shed some light on what the thinking is there and what would be the thinking behind sort of doing that &#8212; I think it&#8217;s called PREP &#8212; versus sort of a broader one.</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; So, look, as you know, we &#8212; we’re not going to go &#8212; get into our private discussions that we have in the White House.&nbsp; The President has said, when it comes to abortion and Roe and fighting for the rights and freedoms and privacy of the American public, everything is on the table.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We &#8212; I don&#8217;t have anything to announce at this time.&nbsp; But the President is going to continue to do everything that he can to protect the rights of women and their reproductive health.&nbsp; He has done that by signing an executive order.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And we&#8217;ve seen &#8212; we&#8217;ve seen announcement from the &#8212; HHS.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve seen announcements, strong statements from the Department of Justice on what they will do to protect, in particular, women who are &#8212; who travel to get that healthcare that they need.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so we&#8217;re &#8212; we have &#8212; we&#8217;re looking at other things that we can do, other meaningful steps that we can take.&nbsp; We just &#8212; I just don&#8217;t have anything to share specific on that thinking and how we&#8217;re going to get to &#8212; get to any announcement that we might be making the next couple of days or sooner.</p>



<p>All right.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karine, do you have any updated thinking or reaction to a trip by Speaker Pelosi to Taiwan?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have much more to say.&nbsp; I spoke to that yesterday.&nbsp; We&#8217;re just not going to speak to any travel.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From what I understand, it has not been locked in.&nbsp; But we refer you to her office for any &#8212; anything further.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We continue &#8212; as I said yesterday, you know, the United States remains committed to our One China Policy, which is set forth in Taiwan Relations Act, the Three Joint Communiqués, and Six Assurances.&nbsp; This has been a consistent U.S. position for decades across multiple administration.&nbsp; U.S. support for Taino- &#8212; Taiwan remains rock solid, principled, bipartisan, and it is in line with our, again, One China Policy and longstanding U.S. commitments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All right.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karine &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Yeah?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; can you provide any preview of the President&#8217;s message on the gun event tomorrow in Wilkes-Barre?&nbsp; Is he going to announce new actions or have a new message when it comes to the issue?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; So, as you know, he&#8217;s going to be traveling to Pennsylvania tomorrow to do his crime &#8212; crime event.&nbsp; And the President will give remarks on building on the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, which he signed into law last month, and how we can further reduce gun crimes and save lives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So we should have more information to come.&nbsp; We&#8217;ll likely have a backgrounder later tonight so that you guys could get some insight on what the &#8212; what tomorrow is going to look like and our travels.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just one last thing.&nbsp; And I know you were asked about this yesterday, but I&#8217;m just &#8212; you know, since it&#8217;s such a fast-moving story on both fronts, I just wanted to ask you again.&nbsp; Is there any concern that if you, sort of &#8212; that there is a desire internally to declare public health emergencies &#8212; like, to declare a climate emergency and a public health emergency a little bit concurrently rather than sort of &#8212;</p>



<p>I think that when I talk to people, it seems like you guys will catch a lot of flak from abortion rights activists if there is, you know, a climate emergency that&#8217;s rolled out fairly quickly after what happened last week with Manchin and, whereas, you know, there has been a lot of wait and see on the public health emergency.</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; So, look, on &#8212; when it comes to climate change, the per- &#8212; the President &#8212; you&#8217;re going to hear from him today, as Gina just stated, how urgent it is.&nbsp; The urgency is now to do something, and he has been doing &#8212; taking action since very early in his administration, and he&#8217;ll continue to do that.</p>



<p>When it comes to Roe, when it comes to abortion more specifically, the President has taken action on that and made that a priority since Texas S.B. 8 happened a few months ago.&nbsp; And you&#8217;ve heard from our administration there on ways that we were going to &#8212; to help to make sure that women are able to make their own decision and get that safe care that they need.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so, look, everything is on the table.&nbsp; We have not made any decisions yet.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t want to get ahead of the policy process.&nbsp; I&#8217;m certainly not going to get ahead of the President.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But these are two issues that are priorities for him, that are important for him.&nbsp; You&#8217;ve heard from the President directly on Roe and the decision &#8212; that extreme decision that SCOTUS made just a couple of weeks ago.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And today you&#8217;re going to hear where he is and how he&#8217;s going to continue to fight for climate change.&nbsp; Because we got to remember climate change is about our economy, it&#8217;s about our national security &#8212; all the things that are so important &#8212; and our families and how do we make sure that we do everything that we can to protect those things.</p>



<p>All right.&nbsp; Thanks, everybody.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll see you on the ground.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Via Teleconference</p>



<p>11:01 A.M. EDT</p>



<p>&nbsp;MR. HASAN:&nbsp; Hi, everyone.&nbsp; Thanks for joining us today.&nbsp; This is Abdullah from the White House.<br><br>Today, we&#8217;ll be holding a background briefing on the actions the President will announce while in Somerset, Massachusetts, to tackle the climate crisis and seize the opportunity of a clean energy future.<br><br>As a reminder, the call will be on background, attributable to a senior administration official.&nbsp; It will be embargoed until the start of the President&#8217;s remarks in Somerset today.<br><br>Not for reporting purposes but for your awareness, joining us for the call today is [senior administration official].&nbsp; He will deliver some remarks up top, and then we will take your questions.<br><br>Over to you, [senior administration official].</p>



<p><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Thanks, everybody, for joining.&nbsp; And really, really excited for an opportunity to talk to you about what the President will be laying out this afternoon in Massachusetts.<br><br>As the President, I think, has said from day one, we really face an urgent crisis in the changing climate.&nbsp; It&#8217;s something that is becoming increasingly manifest across our country, whether it&#8217;s in the wildfires or hurricanes, the extreme flooding events, or &#8212; as is front of mind for the 100 million Americans who face different forms of heat advisories and warnings around the country right now &#8212; extreme heat, which it has shattered 90 records around the country, which is driving folks to face increasingly severe health ailments, putting people in the ER, and which drives home the point that this is a clear and present danger for our country, for our health, for our economy, for our national security.&nbsp; And it demands that we take action boldly.</p>



<p><br>In addition to that recognition that what we face is a challenge, what we face is urgent, what has already been unleashed in terms of climate is devastating &#8212; in addition to making that point, making it vividly and clearly, the President will also talk about the incredible opportunity that we have if we get our act together, square our shoulders, and take on the climate crisis.<br><br>And going to Massachusetts is a great opportunity for him to lay that out in a place that really represents the playbook for what it means to tackle the climate crisis in a way that can unlock tons of opportunity for our workers, for our communities, and for our economy.<br><br>Brayton Point, where the President will speak, used to be the site of the largest coal plant in New England &#8212; 1500 megawatts, burning coal since 1963.<br><br>The President will speak to how we&#8217;ve had these sources of energy that had been critical to our economy over time and that we&#8217;re seeing a transition to clean energy.&nbsp; And if we embrace that transition, then we&#8217;ll see what&#8217;s happening at Brayton Point happening all around the country.<br><br>Today, Brayton Point is poised to be on the frontier of the clean energy transformation.&nbsp; They&#8217;re going to be manufacturing subsea cables that will help tie offshore wind plants into the grid.&nbsp; They&#8217;re going to be the place where several wind projects actually tie in to the grid, bringing clean electrons into Massachusetts and into New England from where it&#8217;s being generated off the Atlantic coast.<br><br>So, you know, I think part of what the President wants to do this afternoon is lay out that sense of urgency and the clarity around the impacts that we&#8217;re already seeing, and also to lay out the urgency and the &#8212; and his enthusiasm for tapping into the opportunity that we also have in front of us.<br><br>The other thing that you can anticipate is specific actions underneath both of those things.<br><br>First, on heat, the President will be announcing $2.3 billion in funding through the FEMA Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities Program for fiscal year 2022.<br><br>This is a program that existed prior to this administration.&nbsp; But this is the largest amount of funding under BRIC ever in the history of the country.&nbsp; And not only is it large, it is focused on helping communities build resilience to a broad set of climate impacts, including heat waves, which is particularly salient; doing it in a way that is going to support the administration&#8217;s Justice40 Initiative and make sure that we&#8217;re lifting up communities that have been disadvantaged.<br><br>And then in addition to the announcement on BRIC, the President will be talking about new guidance from the Department of Health and Human Services, which will actually allow communities, acting through the states, of course, to leverage the historic funding that the President has delivered to the LIHEAP program.&nbsp; That is the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program.&nbsp; Used to be something that helped folks deal with heating issues in the wintertime.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This administration is broadening that program out, calibrating it to this new climate reality.&nbsp; And with it, states will be able to establish cooling centers, they will be able to help folks buy or lend efficient air conditioning units, help defray the costs that are incurred to keep cool during the summer for these vulnerable populations.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s immediate. &nbsp;That&#8217;s an incredibly important thing to get out there.<br><br>And then on the opportunity side, I think many of you covered when the President brought together state and local leaders, industry leaders, and union leaders together at the White House this past month to launch the Federal-State Offshore Wind Implementation Partnership.&nbsp; Building on that, the President is going to the Interior Department &#8212; direct the Interior Department to propose the first wind energy areas in the Gulf of Mexico.<br><br>For those keeping score at home &#8212; you know, when we came into office, offshore wind was facing a uncertain future.&nbsp; Not only did this administration approve the first commercial wind project, Vineyard Wind &#8212; which actually is a partner in building this facility at Brayton Point &#8212; but it also opened up these wind energy areas all across the Atlantic, as far south as North Carolina; started opening up wind energy areas on the Pacific; and today we open up yet another coast and frontier in expanding offshore wind.<br><br>And at the same time, the President is also directing the Secretary of Interior to advance wind energy development in the waters off the mid- and southern Atlantic coast and off Florida&#8217;s Gulf Coast, alleviating uncertainty cast by the prior administration.<br><br>So those are some of the actions the President will announce.&nbsp; And bottom line: You know, I think this is a &#8212; this is an opportunity for the President, in part also, to just come out and provide his take on where we are on climate &#8212; on the urgency, on the opportunity.&nbsp; And, of course, he had issued a written statement last week with regard to action in Congress.&nbsp; And this is an opportunity for him to also speak to that.<br><br>So with that, maybe, Abdullah, back to you.</p>



<p><br>MR. HASAN:&nbsp; Thank you, [senior administration official].&nbsp; And we&#8217;re going to go into questions now, but just before we do, I forgot to mention at the top, we will have embargoed materials coming around shortly.&nbsp; Sorry you didn’t get them ahead of the call, but they will be coming to you soon.<br><br>With that, we&#8217;ll go ahead and take some questions.&nbsp; If you would like to ask a question, please use the “raise hand” feature at the bottom of your screen.<br><br>Again, if you&#8217;d like to ask a question, please use the “raise hand” feature at the bottom of your screen.<br><br>And for the first question, we&#8217;ll go Coral Davenport.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, guys.&nbsp; Thanks for doing the call.&nbsp; [Senior administration official], in addition to making these announcements, is he going to talk about the regulations that are currently under development at EPA, give any kind of update, any kind of timeline on those?&nbsp;</p>



<p>And also, are we going to see anything else later in the week?&nbsp; Karine suggested yesterday that there could be more to come.&nbsp; She said no climate emergency this week, but it potentially is still on the table.&nbsp; Will we see that?&nbsp; And will we see &#8212; I mean, will we see any other &#8212; you know, any other executive authority or orders or anything else in this space later during this week?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; So, I think the President is going to be very clear that since Congress is not going to act on this emergency, he will.&nbsp; He is going to state it loudly, he&#8217;s going to state it clearly &#8212; what he put in his written statement last week, and that is that as President, he will use his executive powers to combat the climate crisis in the absence of additional congressional action.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think he will also lay out that, in the coming days, he expects his administration to begin to announce the executive actions that his administration has developed and is developing to combat this emergency.&nbsp; So I think you will hear that from him in his &#8212; in his own words.&nbsp; And hopefully, that&#8217;s responsive to part of your question.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the second bit: This administration, really, almost on a daily basis, from January 21st, has been advancing climate action.&nbsp; So if you&#8217;re asking me to forecast the rest of the week, yeah, we&#8217;re going to keep taking climate action every single day because that&#8217;s been part and parcel of this administration&#8217;s focus.&nbsp; This is one of the four crises the President defined when he was inaugurated.&nbsp; And that direction has been very clear.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I think what he &#8212; what he has expressed and what he will express this afternoon is about accelerating that action, heightening that ambition, and using the executive powers to combat the climate crisis in the absence of additional congressional action.</p>



<p>MR. HASAN:&nbsp; Thank you, [senior administration official].&nbsp; And we’ll go to Ben (inaudible) next.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, good morning.&nbsp; Can you hear me okay?&nbsp; (Cat meows.)</p>



<p>MR. HASAN:&nbsp; We can.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; One of our cats is joining, sorry.&nbsp; Anyway, I just &#8212; not to overly parse words, but, [senior administration official], you said a moment ago that the President is going to be very clear that “since Congress is not going to act on this emergency.”&nbsp; Does that mean that the President has concluded that there is no longer any option for a reconciliation package with these large clean energy incentives and investments?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Yeah, Ben, thanks.&nbsp; Thanks for &#8212; thanks for the question.&nbsp; And I don&#8217;t think we can hear the cats.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But &#8212; but, I’ll &#8212; you know, I&#8217;ll restate it: The President is going to lay out what he can do, what he intends to do.&nbsp; He has very specific executive powers.&nbsp; He has leveraged executive action to date.&nbsp; He has directed his administration to look at a broad set of options for how to accelerate those actions, to how to implement that &#8212; those executive powers with the highest ambition, and that&#8217;s his focus.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I think the rest of your question &#8212; probably there are other folks who can who can answer that better.&nbsp; And, you know, our focus is on what we can do in light of where we find ourselves between the urgency of action and the clarity of opportunity that&#8217;s in front of us.</p>



<p>MR. HASAN:&nbsp; All right, thank you, [senior administration official].&nbsp; I actually do think we are at time now &#8212; 11:15.&nbsp; So, apologies if we weren&#8217;t able to get to your question.&nbsp; Please feel free to follow up with me via email.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, again, we&#8217;ll try to get you the materials as soon as possible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thank you for joining.&nbsp; As a reminder, the call is embargoed until the President’s &#8212; the top of the President&#8217;s remarks.&nbsp; And it is attributable to a “senior administration official.”&nbsp; Thanks for joining.</p>

<p><em>New Actions to Accelerate Clean Energy, Create Jobs, and Lower Costs</em></p>



<p>Today, President Biden will reiterate that climate change is a clear and present danger to the United States. Since Congress is not acting on this emergency, President Biden will. In the coming weeks, President Biden will announce additional executive actions to combat this emergency.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, President Biden is announcing his latest set of executive actions to turn the climate crisis into an opportunity, by creating good-paying jobs in clean energy and lowering costs for families. His actions will protect communities from climate impacts already here, including extreme heat conditions impacting more than 100 million Americans this week, and expand offshore wind opportunities and jobs in the United States.</p>



<p>The President will make the announcements at a former coal-fired power plant in Brayton Point, Massachusetts that will host a cable manufacturing facility to support the flourishing offshore wind industry – representing how the President’s leadership is accelerating the nation’s transition away from the pollution, environmental injustice, and volatile price swings of the past toward the good-paying jobs and energy security of the future.</p>



<p>President Biden’s new executive actions will:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Protect Communities from Extreme Heat and Dangerous Climate Impacts: </strong>The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is announcing $2.3 billion in funding for its Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program for Fiscal Year 2022— the largest BRIC investment in history, boosted by the President’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. This funding will help communities increase resilience to heat waves, drought, wildfires, flood, hurricanes, and other hazards by preparing before disaster strikes. BRIC is among hundreds of federal programs that the Biden-Harris Administration is transforming to support the Justice40 Initiative and prioritize delivering benefits to disadvantaged communities.<br><br></li><li><strong>Lower Cooling Costs for Communities Suffering from Extreme Heat:</strong> Today, the Department of Health and Human Services is issuing <a href="https://www.acf.hhs.gov/ocs/policy-guidance/liheap-im-2022-06-heat-stress-flexibilities-and-resources-fy2022">guidance</a> that for the first time expands how the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) can promote the delivery of efficient air conditioning equipment, community cooling centers, and more. In April, the Biden-Harris Administration released $385 million through LIHEAP to help families with their household energy costs, including summer cooling—part of a record $8 billion that the Administration has provided, boosted by the President’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Expand Offshore Wind Opportunities and Jobs:</strong> The Department of the Interior is proposing the first Wind Energy Areas in the Gulf of Mexico, a historic step toward expanding offshore wind opportunities to another region of the United States. These areas cover 700,000 acres and have the potential to power over three million homes. President Biden is also directing the Secretary of the Interior to advance wind energy development in the waters off the mid- and southern Atlantic Coast and Florida’s Gulf Coast —alleviating uncertainty cast by the prior Administration. These actions follow the President’s launch of a new <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/06/23/fact-sheet-biden-administration-launches-new-federal-state-offshore-wind-partnership-to-grow-american-made-clean-energy/">Federal-State Offshore Wind Implementation Partnership</a> that brought together Governors to deliver more clean, affordable energy and new jobs.<br><br></li></ul>



<p>Millions of Americans feel the effects of climate change each year when their roads wash out, power goes down, homes are destroyed by wildfires, or schools get flooded. Last year alone, the United States faced 20 extreme weather and climate related disaster events with losses exceeding $1 billion each – a cumulative price tag of more than $145 billion. People of color and underserved communities are disproportionately vulnerable to the climate crisis and are more likely to experience the negative health and environmental effects of climate-related and extreme weather events. Further, the country’s critical infrastructure is at risk from climate and extreme weather.</p>



<p>President Biden will not back down from addressing this emergency. Since taking office, he has <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/climate/">mobilized his entire Administration to tackle the climate crisis</a> and secured historic clean energy and climate resilience investments in his Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. He will continue taking bold action to secure a safe, healthy, clean energy future—all while saving families money, delivering clean air and water, advancing environmental justice, and boosting American manufacturing and competitiveness.</p>



<p><strong><u>PROTECTING COMMUNITIES FROM EXTREME HEAT</u></strong></p>



<p>This summer, millions of Americans are navigating the challenges and dangers that come with extreme heat advisories and record-breaking temperatures exceeding 100 degrees Fahrenheit. The climate crisis is making heat waves more intense and frequent, taking a toll on health across the country—sending tens of thousands of Americans to the emergency room, increasing risks of heart and respiratory problems, and especially endangering our workers, children, seniors, historically underserved and overburdened communities, and people with underlying health conditions.</p>



<p>To respond, last year the Biden-Harris Administration launched a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/09/20/fact-sheet-biden-administration-mobilizes-to-protect-workers-and-communities-from-extreme-heat/">broad set of new initiatives</a> to  advance workplace safety, build local resilience, and address the disproportionate impacts of extreme heat. Today, the Administration is announcing additional steps and progress on:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Providing Record Funding to Increase Community Resilience:</strong> Last year, President Biden doubled the funding available through FEMA’s Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program. This year, he is doubling it again, to a historic level of $2.3 billion available for states, local communities, Tribes, and territories to proactively reduce their vulnerability to heat waves, drought, wildfires, flood, hurricanes, and other hazards boosted by the President’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. As part of the President’s Justice40 Initiative, which set a goal of delivering 40% of the overall benefits of Federal investments in climate and clean energy to disadvantaged communities, FEMA is prioritizing communities that have long been marginalized, overburdened, and underserved.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Expanding Access to Home Air Conditioners and Community Cooling Centers: </strong>In April, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) released $385 million through LIHEAP to <a>help families with their household energy costs, including summer cooling</a>—part of a record $8 billion that the Administration has provided, boosted by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, to reduce cooling and heating costs for low-income Americans. Today, HHS is issuing <a href="https://www.acf.hhs.gov/ocs/policy-guidance/liheap-im-2022-06-heat-stress-flexibilities-and-resources-fy2022">guidance</a> that will help states, Tribes, and territories expand how they respond to extreme heat and support vulnerable communities through LIHEAP. The guidance provides for a range of flexible options including increasing funding for cooling assistance through the American Rescue Plan; establishing community cooling centers; and purchasing, distributing, or loaning efficient air conditioning equipment, evaporative coolers and electric heat pumps—a more energy-efficient alternative for providing cooling services—to vulnerable households and individuals. HHS has also developed a <a href="https://www.acf.hhs.gov/ocs/liheap-and-extreme-heat">LIHEAP and Extreme Heat</a> website to provide online resources including the Heat Stress Geographic Information (GIS) Dashboard to help grant recipients and stakeholders track, visualize, and respond to heat stress trends and needs across the country.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Enforcing Workplace Safety: </strong>Heat is a growing threat to workplace safety, especially in high-risk sectors like agriculture and construction. In April, Vice President Harris and Secretary of Labor Walsh launched the first-ever National Emphasis Program to protect millions of workers from heat illness and injuries. Since then, the Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has <strong>already conducted</strong> <strong>564 heat-related inspections, which are focused on over 70 high-risk industries across 43 states. </strong>On days when the heat index is 80°F or higher, OSHA inspectors and compliance assistance specialists are engaging in proactive outreach and technical assistance to help stakeholders keep workers safe on the job.<br><br></li></ul>



<p>Through the Extreme Heat Interagency Working Group under the National Climate Task Force, the Administration is advancing a wide range of additional efforts, including a <a href="https://www.osha.gov/heat-exposure/rulemaking">historic OSHA rulemaking process</a> toward the first federal heat standard to protect workers, EPA support for community <a href="https://www.epa.gov/innovation/lets-talk-about-heat-challenge">communication strategies</a> to help people keep safe on the hottest days, a DHS <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/news/2022/07/05/dhs-prize-winners-announced-challenge-counter-extreme-temperatures">Cooling Solutions Challenge</a> to fund innovative extreme heat responses,&nbsp; NOAA’s community-led <a href="https://www.noaa.gov/news-release/noaa-and-communities-to-map-heat-inequities-in-14-us-cities-and-counties">urban heat island mapping campaign</a>, a USDA <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/managing-land/urban-forests/ucf">urban and community forestry program</a> to equitably improve heat resilience, and a new <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/climate-change-health-equity-environmental-justice/climate-change-health-equity/climate-health-outlook/index.html">HHS Climate and Health Outlook</a> to inform health professionals about extreme heat and other climate-related health hazards.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><u>BOOSTING THE OFFSHORE WIND INDUSTRY AND CREATING JOBS</u></strong></p>



<p>Since President Biden set a bold goal of deploying 30 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2030, the Administration has approved the first large-scale projects and new wind energy areas, held record-breaking wind auctions, and issued an action plan to accelerate permitting. The private sector is following suit with investments to expand an American-made wind energy supply chain. In 2021 alone, investors announced $2.2 billion in new supply chain funding, including commitments to develop nine major manufacturing facilities to produce the foundations, towers, cables, and blades of offshore wind turbines. Historic project labor agreements are helping to grow a diverse union workforce, create good-paying jobs, and support training programs.</p>



<p>To further expand these opportunities, today President Biden is:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Kickstarting Potential for Offshore Wind in Gulf of Mexico:</strong> Today, the Department of the Interior is announcing draft Wind Energy Areas and an accompanying draft Environmental Assessment to consider potential offshore wind power in the Gulf of Mexico. The Administration will seek public input on two potential Wind Energy Areas—one off the coast of Galveston, Texas and another off the coast of Lake Charles, Louisiana. The area for review covers over 700,000 acres, with the potential to power over three million homes with clean energy. As with prior proposals, the Administration is committed to working in partnership with stakeholders to advance offshore wind development while protecting biodiversity and promoting ocean co-use.<br><br></li><li><strong>Promoting Offshore Wind Opportunities in the Southeast:</strong> The prior Administration cast uncertainty over the future of offshore wind and other clean energy development off the coasts of Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina. Today, President Biden is directing the Secretary of the Interior to advance clean energy development in these federal waters—ensuring that these southeast states will be able to benefit from good-paying jobs in the burgeoning offshore wind industry.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>These actions follow the President’s announcement last month of a new <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/06/23/fact-sheet-biden-administration-launches-new-federal-state-offshore-wind-partnership-to-grow-american-made-clean-energy/">Federal-State Offshore Wind Implementation Partnership</a>, joining with Governors to ensure that federal and state officials are working together to build a U.S.-based supply chain, including manufacturing and shipbuilding, for the rapidly-growing offshore wind industry. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>First Lady Jill Biden and U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona Embark on a Multi-State Summer Learning Tour </em></p>



<p>Summer learning and enrichment programs can play a critical role in student success. From providing students opportunities to catch up academically from what they may have missed during the pandemic to providing channels for students to engage with their peers, friends, and caring adults, summer programs across the country are helping students recover and thrive. President Biden has invested significantly in expanding summer programs for students and families across the nation, because he knows it is an essential ingredient in student recovery and success. Through President Biden’s American Rescue Plan (ARP), states and districts received $122 billion to help schools reopen and help students catch up academically and access mental health supports, including by increasing summer programming. As a result, all 50 states, Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico, are investing in summer learning and enrichment offerings, providing more opportunities for students – especially those disproportionately impacted by the pandemic – to benefit academically and socially from these programs.</p>



<p>Further elevating the importance of high-quality summer learning programs, President Biden has called on schools to use American Rescue plan funds to provide high-quality summer learning programs – as well as tutoring and afterschool programs – at the scale needed to support, on average, an additional four months of learning gains in reading and math.</p>



<p>Starting today, First Lady Jill Biden and Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona embark on a tour across the country to amplify that call and highlight how the Biden-Harris Administration is helping students catch up academically through summer learning programs supported by the American Rescue Plan.</p>



<p><strong>Summer learning and enrichment programming is among the top strategies school districts are using to address missed instruction – and the American Rescue Plan is funding it.</strong></p>



<p>President Biden’s American Rescue Plan provided states and districts with $122 billion to help schools reopen and help students recover academically and access the mental health supports they need. States were also required to set aside over a billion dollars in funding to invest in summer programs, because summer is an important time for students to reengage with their peers and teachers, catch up academically from missed instruction, and get the social, emotional, and mental health supports they need.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Local school districts plan to spend $27 billion of American Rescue Plan funds on academic recovery. </strong>According to a June <a href="https://www.future-ed.org/financial-trends-in-local-schools-covid-aid-spending/">analysis</a> by Future Ed, school districts across the country plan to spend $27 billion on academic recovery, second only to investments in staffing to help students recover from the pandemic and thrive. The American Rescue Plan requires districts to spend 20% of their ARP Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ESSER) funds on academic recovery, but according to the analysis, districts are planning to spend more than the required percentage – at least 25% &#8211; to help more students catch up academically. Districts are also planning to spend an additional 23% of their ARP funds on staffing – which will play a critical role in helping students recover academically and access the supports they need.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Summer learning is among the top strategies school districts are using to provide additional academic instruction &nbsp;</strong>The Future Ed analysis also found that summer learning and afterschool programs make up nearly a quarter of the academic recovery investments. Its analysis projects that schools plan to spend over $6 billion of their ARP ESSER funds on these types of programs.</li></ul>



<p><strong>First Lady Jill Biden and Secretary Cardona will highlight summer learning and enrichment programs in Connecticut, Michigan, and Georgia.</strong></p>



<p>Today, First Lady Jill Biden and Secretary Cardona kicked off a multi-state tour highlighting ARP-funded summer learning programs that are helping students catch up academically and providing them with mental health, social, and emotional supports they need to succeed. Together Connecticut, Michigan, and Georgia received $9 billion in ARP ESSER funds to support safe school reopening and recovery and are anticipated to spend at least $2 billion dollars on academic recovery, including through summer learning and afterschool programs.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Connecticut has received $1.1 billion in ARP ESSER funds, and the state and school districts are anticipated to spend at least $275 million dollars on state and local academic recovery efforts through September 2024. </strong>The Connecticut State Department of Education launched a Summer Enrichment Grant Program to provide up to $250,000 in funds each to dozens of grant recipients that are providing and expanding summer programs this year, particularly those serving students most impacted by the pandemic. Last summer, Connecticut awarded nearly $9 &nbsp;million to grant recipients for summer programming.</li></ul>



<p>Dr. Biden and Secretary Cardona will visit a&nbsp;Horizons National summer learning program,&nbsp;held at&nbsp;Albertus Magnus College in New Haven,&nbsp;CT,&nbsp;serving&nbsp;elementary&nbsp;students from local public schools. Horizons received a $157,500 ARP grant, which is allowing the organization to expand its programming across the New Haven region to serve 1,000 students.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Because of ARP ESSER funds, public schools in Detroit, MI have been able to double the number of students in summer school this year. </strong>Detroit, MI received over $800 million in ARP ESSER funds, and the state overall received over $3.7 billion in ARP ESSER funds. The state and school districts are anticipated to spend at least $925 million dollars on academic recovery, including through summer programming. Because of ARP ESSER, Detroit was able to expand its summer enrichment offerings and doubled the number of students in summer programs this year. As a result, 8,000 students are attending summer school this year.</li></ul>



<p>Dr. Biden and Secretary Cardona will visit a Detroit Public Schools Community District summer learning program, held at Schulze Academy for Technology and Arts in Detroit, MI, serving kindergarten through 8th grade students from the school district. ARP funding has enabled thousands more students in the district to access summer programming, with a focus on enrichment opportunities including STEM and STEAM programming, arts, coding and cooking.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><strong>Georgia is granting $40 million to over 100 organizations across the state operating summer and afterschool programs. </strong>Georgia received $4.2 billion in ARP ESSER funds, roughly $1 billion of which the state and school districts are anticipated to spend on academic recovery. As part of this effort, Georgia created the Building Opportunities in Out-of-School Time (BOOST) Grant program, where the state funds grants to community-based organizations that operate summer and afterschool programs. The goal of the program is to provide evidence-based programming focused on supporting students most impacted by the pandemic and helping them recover. Georgia is granting $40 million to approximately 100-120 organizations doing this critical work across the state, funded by ARP.</li></ul>



<p>Dr. Biden and Secretary Cardona will visit a Horizons National summer learning program,&nbsp;held at the&nbsp;University of Georgia&nbsp;in Athens, GA,&nbsp;serving students from Barnett Shoals Elementary School. Horizons received a BOOST Grant of $192,500 per year for three years starting this year to provide and expand programming to more Athens youth during the summer and year-round.</p>



<p>Dr. Biden and Secretary Cardona’s tour is part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s broader commitment to addressing lost instructional time and ensuring students have the mental health supports they need to recover and thrive. Earlier this month, the Administration <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/07/05/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-launches-national-effort-to-support-student-success/">launched</a> a national strategy to help students recover academically, with the goal of mobilizing 250,000 tutors and mentors to support students’ academic needs across the country. Tutors, mentors, and other adults in high-impact roles will play a critical role this summer and during the school year in helping students recover academically and succeed in and out of the classroom.

<p class="has-text-align-center">Via Recorded Video</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">As Prepared for Delivery</p>



<p>Greetings from Washington, D.C. I want to thank the Corporate Council on Africa, the Kingdom of Morocco, and His Majesty King Mohammed for hosting the 2022 U.S.-Africa Business Summit. I am honored to participate in this opening ceremony.</p>



<p>President Joe Biden and I recognize the critical importance of strengthening our relationship with countries across Africa. To that end, I will start with some very important news. President Biden and I are looking forward to welcoming leaders from across the African continent to Washington, D.C. from December 13<sup>th</sup> through the 15th, for the United States-Africa Leaders Summit.</p>



<p>This Summit will demonstrate America’s enduring commitment to our African partners, and it will be based on principles of mutual respect and shared interests and values. And a critical part of this Summit will be to bolster our economic relationship, which brings me to the importance of this gathering of public and private sector leaders in Marrakech.</p>



<p>I believe in the power of public-private —partnerships that bring together the experience and the expertise of the private sector with the mission of government to act for the public good and with the public trust, and the reach and capacity that governments can give, uniquely, to any endeavor.</p>



<p>By working together, we can unleash growth and opportunity that far exceeds what either the public or private sector can achieve on its own. And, as everyone here knows, there is so much opportunity for economic growth &#8211;in Africa and, of course, the United States—when we all collaborate and coordinate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Africa is the world’s fastest-growing continent. By 2030, the continent will have 1.7 billion people, home to one-fifth of the world’s population. The continent is also increasingly young, urban and connected. There is a growing demand for food, healthcare, education, technology, and infrastructure.</p>



<p>Yet, barriers remain: limited access to capital, the high cost of financing, and legal and regulatory bottlenecks. This is on top of the global challenges that I know are felt acutely in Africa, including recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, the climate crisis, and food insecurity.</p>



<p>The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to working with all of you to address these issues, in furtherance of  the African Union’s Agenda 2063.</p>



<p>With regard to food insecurity, we are focused on the urgent need to increase food production and exports with and within Africa, a challenge made worse by Putin’s war in Ukraine. To this end, since last October, the United States has pledged more than $7 billion in humanitarian and food security assistance across Africa.</p>



<p>More broadly, our Administration’s goal is to promote inclusive and sustainable economic growth and development across the continent, to expand capital flows, and to promote the vibrant spirit of entrepreneurship and innovation that is so prevalent across Africa.</p>



<p>I am pleased to see the advances made in implementing the African Continental Free Trade Area and we will work with you to ensure its success.</p>



<p>The United States is committed to bring to bear all the tools at our disposal, including, development financing, grants and technical assistance, and support for legal and regulatory reforms—all to help our African partners thrive.</p>



<p>As part of this, our signature investment initiative in Africa—Prosper Africa—has convened a delegation to be with you in Marrakech. Led by Millennium Challenge Corporation CEO Alice Albright, it includes officials from 10 U.S. government departments and agencies. It also includes a group of investors who collectively manage more than a trillion dollars in assets.</p>



<p>Over the coming days, our delegation will discuss with you a range of issues. This includes work to advance our new global infrastructure initiative, and our work to mobilize hundreds of billions of dollars for high-quality, sustainable infrastructure investment.</p>



<p>It also includes our effort to expand Power Africa, one of our largest public-private partnerships in the world—this work will increase access to electricity, support a just energy transition, and more.</p>



<p>This week’s convening is very important. When everyone is at the table, we are better able to collaborate, coordinate, and identify new opportunities. So, I wish you a productive Summit in Marrakech.</p>



<p>This work will benefit United States-African business ties and diplomatic ties. And most importantly, it will benefit both the people of Africa and the people of the United States.</p>



<p>Thank you.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Today is another step forward in our nation’s fight against the virus. Following an independent scientific review by the Food and Drug Administration last week and today by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Novavax’s protein-based COVID-19 vaccine for adults has been authorized. We now have four safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines available to protect Americans against serious illness, hospitalizations, and death.<br> <br>When I took office, my Administration took decisive action to fix a broken COVID-19 response and stand up a historic vaccination program that has gotten over 260 million Americans at least their first shot, and nearly 110 million people a booster shot. This unprecedented effort has already saved over 2 million American lives, but more people need to roll up their sleeves, particularly as we confront BA.5.<br> <br>The science and data are clear: vaccines continue to protect people from serious illness, hospitalizations, and death—and with BA.5 increasing infections, it is essential that people get themselves and their kids vaccinated and stay up to date on their COVID-19 vaccinations. I encourage everyone to get their booster if they are eligible. If you’re age 50 or older, or a moderately or severely immunocompromised individual, and haven’t gotten a vaccine shot this year—you should get one right away. It is free, easy, and could save your life.<br> <br>Over the past 18 months, my Administration has left no stone unturned to ensure Americans have easy and convenient access to lifesaving tools, including vaccines, treatments, tests and more. These tools work even in the face of BA.5—they protect people, keep people out of the hospital, and save lives. While we know COVID-19 isn’t over, we can manage this moment and continue to minimize COVID-19’s impact on our daily lives.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Via Teleconference<br>(July 18, 2022)</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; And thank you all for joining this evening’s NSC background call on President Biden’s new executive order to bolster efforts to bring home American hostages and wrongful detainees.</p>



<p>As a reminder of the ground rules, this call is on background attributable to “senior administration officials” and embargoed until tomorrow morning, Tuesday, July 19th at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Standard Time.</p>



<p>For your awareness but not for your reporting, today’s speakers are [senior administration official], [senior administration official], and [senior administration official].&nbsp;</p>



<p>With that, I’ll turn it over to [senior administration official], our first speaker.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Thank you so much, [moderator], and thanks to everyone for joining this call.&nbsp; We are eager to share how the Biden-Harris administration is expanding the toolkit that the U.S. government uses to help bring home American hostages and wrongful detainees.</p>



<p>Foreign states that engage in the practice of wrongful detention, whether it’s for political leverage or to seek concessions from the United States, threaten the integrity of the international political system and, moreover, the safety of US nationals and other persons abroad.&nbsp; And the same can be said of terrorist organizations, criminal groups, and other malicious actors who take hostages for financial, political, or other nefarious gains.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The U.S. government maintains its unwavering commitment to bringing home Americans held hostage and wrongfully detained.</p>



<p>And so that is why we are proud to announce that tomorrow, President Biden will be signing a new executive order that will provide new and expanded tools to help bring our citizens home and impose costs on the culprits as well as provide greater transparency regarding the risks.</p>



<p>The new executive order is entitled “Bolstering Efforts to Bring Hostages and Wrongfully Detained U.S. Nationals Home.”&nbsp; It reaffirms the fundamental commitment of the President, of the administration to bring home those Americans held hostage and wrongfully detained abroad.</p>



<p>The executive order draws on the 2020 Robert Levinson Hostage Recovery and Hostage Taking Accountability Act.&nbsp; And just as the name itself suggests, that law is a credit to the perseverance of the Levinson family and others who have turned their family’s extraordinary hardships into constructive and meaningful action.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Frankly, all of us who work on these issues are blown away by the courage and the leadership the families in these awful circumstances show in an effort to make our government and all of us better in resolving these cases.</p>



<p>The new EO builds on those efforts and the efforts of others who have worked diligently to bring the Levinson Act to fruition, and it expands and strengthens the government’s toolkit in key ways.</p>



<p>For example, this EO reinforces U.S. government efforts to support the families of Americans wrongfully detained or held hostage overseas by directing parts of the federal government to bolster their engagement with such families and their sharing of relevant information, including intelligence information, with families regarding their loved ones’ status and the government’s efforts to secure their release or their return.</p>



<p>The new executive order also authorizes departments and agencies to impose costs and consequences on those who are involved.&nbsp; That includes financial sanctions and it includes visa bans, and it can apply whether the individual subject to those costs and consequences has acted on behalf of a state or a terrorist network or some other non-state actor.</p>



<p>This EO reflects the administration’s commitment not just to the issues generally, but to the families in particular, and it has been informed by the government’s regular engagements with them and other stakeholders who have and continue to undertake important, constructive advocacy efforts on behalf of their loved ones.</p>



<p>President Biden and those across the administration will now draw on this EO to advance our efforts, and we hope to do so in active conversation with family members and outside stakeholders.</p>



<p>In addition to the EO, tomorrow, the Biden-Harris administration will introduce a new risk indicator, the “D” for wrongful detention indicator, to the State Department’s travel advisories, which exist for all countries around the world to warn Americans of risks they may face in traveling to particular destinations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This new “D” indicator will, in particular, inform American travelers of the risk of wrongful detention by a foreign government, will highlight the elevated risk that Americans face in particular countries, and provide Americans with comprehensive safety and security information to use in making informed travel decisions.</p>



<p>Its transparency will also show to governments that engage in this sort of reprehensible practice, and indeed to the world, our commitment to calling out this sort of behavior.</p>



<p>The “D” indicator joins the existing “K” for kidnapping indicator that covers the risk of kidnapping and hostage taking by non-state actors as well as a range of other existing risk indicators.</p>



<p>State Department travel advisories are continuously revised and updated based on a comprehensive review of all available safety information and ongoing developments.</p>



<p>I should emphasize here that this work to punish those responsible for this sort of behavior, to increase transparency, to share risks about hostage taking and wrongful detention, all of this is in addition to the very hard, very important work that we do with the NSC, with State Department, the FBI, and other colleagues across the government every day to resolve particular hostage and wrongful detainee matters.&nbsp; This isn’t a substitute; it’s in addition.&nbsp; And it is a way to increase transparency through the indicator, impose costs through the executive order, and overall, try to prevent the next set of families going through this horrible ordeal.</p>



<p>I’ll now turn things over to our next speaker, [senior administration official], for additional context on the new EO and its implementation.&nbsp; And then you’ll hear from our final speaker, [senior administration official], for additional information on the update to our travel advisories.</p>



<p>Over to you, [senior administration official.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Hey, [senior administration official], thanks a lot for that introduction, and thanks for bringing up this topic and also for convening this call.&nbsp; I know you’ve been at this since 2015 trying to work this problem set.&nbsp; So, grateful that you’re able to bring us all together to talk about this.</p>



<p>Folks, the President is once again demonstrating his commitment to bring home U.S. nationals held hostage and wrongfully detained abroad.&nbsp; And we continue to work closely across the administration to realize this prioritized commitment.</p>



<p>The EO is critical and gives the U.S. government expanded tools to help get Americans home, including specific authority to impose sanctions on those responsible for or complicit in wrongful detentions or hostage taking of U.S. persons overseas, regardless of whether the perpetrator is a terrorist or a state actor.</p>



<p>On the new sanctions authority for which the State Department will have the lead for developing targets, our goal is to bring folks home.&nbsp; So we use the sanctions authority with a primary focus on helping to secure a loved one’s release.</p>



<p>Now, using sanctions may not always help secure someone’s release, so we will therefore be judicious and strategic in our use of this authority.&nbsp; But the families of those held know their loved one’s case best and we intend to hear from them, hear their good ideas, and listen to their recommendations.</p>



<p>At this point, I’d like to turn it over to [senior administration official].</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Thank you, [senior administration official].&nbsp; And thanks, everybody, for dialing in today.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I want to take this opportunity to tell you about the parallel efforts to demonstrate our focus on this issue that [senior administration official] mentioned.&nbsp; And that is that tomorrow we’re introducing a new risk indicator, the “D” indicator, to the State Department’s travel advisories to inform U.S. travelers of the risk of wrongful detention by a foreign government.&nbsp; We’re making this change to highlight the elevated risk of wrongful detention in particular countries whose governments have engaged in that practice.</p>



<p>We’re committed to providing U.S. citizens with comprehensive safety and security information about foreign countries so they can make informed travel decisions before they head overseas.</p>



<p>The United States opposes wrongful detention and the practice of using individuals as political bargaining chips everywhere.&nbsp; These practices we know represent a threat to the safety of all U.S. citizens traveling and living abroad.</p>



<p>I’m sure you’ve all heard us say many times that we as a department have no higher priority than the safety and the security of U.S. citizens overseas.&nbsp; We definitely take extremely seriously our commitment to inform U.S. citizens living and traveling abroad of potential risks.&nbsp; And our travel advice is apolitical, fact-based, and transparent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As [senior administration official] noted, we issue travel advisories for every country around the world offering standardized levels of advice based on established risk factors.&nbsp; Our advisories are based on the risk factors that include things like crime, for which we use a “C” indicator; health, for which we use an “H”; and [senior administration official] also mentioned the “K” indicator for kidnapping or hostage taking.</p>



<p>We’re also constantly reviewing our travel advisory system in an effort to provide the most accurate and transparent information for U.S. citizens traveling overseas.</p>



<p>We consider a lot of factors in determining which indicators to incorporate into the travel advisory for each country.&nbsp; The “D” indicator may be assigned to a given country following a department determination that the detention of a U.S. national is wrongful.&nbsp; The indicator will consider the number of cases of wrongful detentions of U.S. nationals in any given country to help determine the appropriate travel advisory level.</p>



<p>We routinely update our travel advisories for all countries based on that ongoing comprehensive review of all available safety information and ongoing developments.</p>



<p>So tomorrow, the following countries will receive the “D”-risk indicator: Burma, the People’s Republic of China, Iran, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Russia, and Venezuela.</p>



<p>So on behalf of the State Department, I want to reiterate our commitment to bringing wrongfully held U.S. nationals home and to working closely with their families to do so.</p>



<p>My colleagues and I in Consular Affairs have a really strong partnership with our colleagues in SPEHA, with [senior administration official]’s team, and we remain in regular contact with the families of those held hostage or wrongfully detained.</p>



<p>We’re really proud of our partnership with SPEHA and with the White House, and we continue to work together to ensure we’re communicating and sharing information in a way that’s useful to the families and to the American public.</p>



<p>So I’ll stop there, and I look forward to answering your questions.&nbsp; Over.</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; With that, I’ll turn it back over to the moderator for question-and-answer.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, thanks for taking the call.&nbsp; A couple questions.&nbsp; Can we expect any sanctions announcements tomorrow along with the rollout of the executive order?&nbsp; And if so, on whom?&nbsp; How long has this executive order been in process, given the Levinson Act has been passed for quite a bit of time now?</p>



<p>And then, tangentially, there’s a number of families of detainees and hostages who are coming to D.C. this week.&nbsp; Will the President meet with any or all of them?&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; I’m happy to take a first stab.&nbsp; My colleagues may have thoughts as well.&nbsp; But thank you, Jennifer, for the good questions.</p>



<p>So I’ll take them in order.&nbsp; There won’t be particular sanctions targets announced tomorrow with the EO, but this is a process that we want and need to be sustainable for weeks and months to come.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other contexts &#8212; and I’m thinking of the human rights context in particular &#8212; the development of those sorts of packages has really generated constructive, productive collaboration, not just across the federal government &#8212; and, of course, this is, by definition, a new authority and we’ll work to build the backing to utilize it &#8212; but also between government and those outside it, with a robust dialogue on the potential targets of sanctions and the information that the government at least should consider in assessing those targets.</p>



<p>So we hope that this is a project that not only gets attention and focus within the government, as it will with the President’s direction coming tomorrow, but also with so many who work so hard on these issues outside government as well.</p>



<p>The executive order has been in development for a while now.&nbsp; Bringing something to the President’s desk obviously takes care and consideration by experts across the government.&nbsp; We also have had a number of steps that have been critical to implementing the Levinson Act, which was an important step forward through legislation.&nbsp; And that has included the use of the statutorily-defined elements for wrongful detention cases, which [senior administration official] may want to say a word about, but which have been used now in an important process that runs within the State Department.</p>



<p>Finally, I can’t speak to the President’s particular schedule, but I can speak to his commitment to these issues and to the priority he places on bringing home Americans held hostage abroad and wrongfully detained abroad.</p>



<p>This executive order is, of course, one significant piece of that but it comes in the wake of efforts to &#8212; and successful efforts &#8212; to bring home Americans from countries really across the globe: Haiti, Afghanistan, Venezuela, Burma, and elsewhere, during the course of this administration.&nbsp; And he’ll continue to track these matters at the highest levels, including with the direct engagement of National Security Council staff leadership, State Department leadership, and others.</p>



<p>But let me see if my colleagues want to chime in on any of those three questions, as well, please.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; This is [senior administration official].&nbsp; And, Jen, I guess the only thing I would say is that, you know, [senior administration official] indicated that a lot of work goes into this to make sure that it’s pretty much perfect when it gets to the President’s desk.&nbsp; I can tell you that we’ve been working pretty hard on this.&nbsp; The meetings have been continuous since the Levinson Act was passed pretty much.</p>



<p>And the idea was that we had to get this right.&nbsp; This is not something we want to rewind in any way, shape, or form.&nbsp; So we wanted to have a tool that was useful.&nbsp; And that took a long time to try to make sure that all the stakeholders got a chance to weigh in so we could find something that was going to be useful, powerful, and going to achieve the end states that we were hoping to achieve.</p>



<p>So it took a while, but if you want to get it right, sometimes you have to invest the time, and I think that’s the case here.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Shall we go to the next question?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hello, thanks for doing this.&nbsp; Recently, a lot of families have criticized the administration over what they see as a lack of strategies broadly.&nbsp; I mean, looking at your executive order, it talks about bolstering engagement, information sharing.&nbsp; A lot of them have been also complaining about lack of communication at times.</p>



<p>But, I mean, can you talk a little bit &#8212; are you able to talk a little bit about broader strategy in terms of what exactly the U.S. government is doing to bring these people home?&nbsp; Do you have a blanket strategy?&nbsp; And by that, I mean, you guys have also been criticized by the families for refusing to make some swaps on certain occasions, and so has there been any change, for example, in that approach?&nbsp; I understand this has to do with DOJ as well.&nbsp; But basically, what is your response to all of those criticisms?&nbsp; Thanks.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Yeah, thanks for the question, and I’m sure [senior administration official] will have some thoughts on this as well.&nbsp; But let me say a couple things.</p>



<p>One, anyone who’s worked on these issues for any period of time knows that strategies need to be case specific.&nbsp; They have to be informed by the intelligence and information about a particular case.&nbsp; They need to take into account country-specific facts, regional facts, and really anything we can bring to bear to leverage to get what we all ultimately want, which is an American home with his or her loved ones.</p>



<p>Families are in regular contact with [senior administration official] and his team at the State Department, as well as for hostage cases, the Hostage Recovery Fusion Cell, which is an interagency body that sits at FBI, and are part of conversations not just in developing strategies but also in refining those strategies and considering when it’s time to pivot to a plan B &#8212; and there always needs to be a plan B.</p>



<p>I would just emphasize in particular that in this administration, the President has been willing to make what he himself has said publicly are tough but important calls when it means bringing home Americans.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I’ll call attention, in particular, to his willingness to do what was necessary to bring home Trevor Reed from wrongful detention in Russia.&nbsp; It is, of course, public that that involved the release of Mr. Yaroshenko, who had served a great deal of but not all of his sentence in the United States.</p>



<p>And the President, as he said in his public statement that day, was willing to take that very rare, very extraordinary, very hard step when it meant bringing home someone for whom there was a great urgency to see home and to see healthy as well.</p>



<p>[Senior administration official], do you have more you want to add?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Thanks, [senior administration official].&nbsp; Yeah, I wouldn’t mind adding just a little bit.</p>



<p>You know, this reminds me of that saying that “the other side always gets a vote.”&nbsp; And I’m always mindful in these cases that as we work on these different strategies &#8212; and as [senior administration official] said, they’re case specific &#8212; but as we’re executing them, at the end of the day, the other side, whether it’s Russia, China, Venezuela, et cetera, they get a vote.&nbsp; In a way, they have a very strong vote in that they hold the keys to the jail cell.&nbsp; And what we often find ourselves doing is trying to strategize and organize and, frankly, work with the families to find ways that might get those keys to open up and we can bring an American home.&nbsp; At times, it can be challenging.</p>



<p>I can tell you I probably spend one to four hours a day on the phone talking to family members.&nbsp; I’m currently away from Washington, D.C.&nbsp; I’m visiting a family tonight; will spend three hours in their home talking about their case.</p>



<p>But the bottom line is that we’re trying to partner with families to find these solutions.&nbsp; We definitely work strongly within the interagency on what we call the Hostage Recovery Enterprise.&nbsp; And frankly, we also work with members of Congress; the members and their staffers; NGOs; I would say, third-party intermediaries, but also even with the media, to come up with, I guess you would say, an overarching way of getting people back.&nbsp; And I think the media has been very powerful in really just calling awareness to this topic and, at times, even holding us accountable.</p>



<p>So, grateful for the chance to talk about this.&nbsp; But, really, to get to the meat of your question, we have ongoing strategies in all this.&nbsp; We review them pretty much on a daily basis, and we’ll partner with everyone we possibly can to see if we can bring this to a successful conclusion.</p>



<p>But I can tell you one thing: that the President of the United States, and my direct report, Secretary Blinken, they are committed to getting all these cases resolved and getting this done, and at the same time, start to bring up a deterrence strategy that can raise the cost of hostage taking and wrongful detention taking to the point that it’s no longer a feasible diplomatic strategy for those who would use it.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Forgive me if I didn’t hear, but I didn’t hear a response to, especially, to Jennifer’s question about whether the President would be meeting with any of the families who were in town while they were here.</p>



<p>And if you could explain: If you are going to redefine when the administration can get involved, if they could get involved sooner with people wrongfully held &#8212; if you’re moving that bar. And if you can explain why Mark Fogel is not considered wrongfully detained, because his former colleagues and friends at the Embassy Moscow tell us that his conviction is for medical marijuana, and it seems very similar to the Griner case.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thank you so much.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Yeah, thank you for the questions.&nbsp; I’ll take a first stab and, again, invite colleagues to comment.</p>



<p>On the third one, I won’t comment &#8212; I don’t think any of us will &#8212; on a particular case, but refer you to the State Department which handles by law, by the Levinson Act, designations of those unlawfully or wrongfully detained.</p>



<p>I’ll reiterate that I can’t speak for the President’s schedule but can speak for his commitment to these issues and his willingness to authorize and indeed direct, as this executive order does, the parts of his government that can do really the two things [senior administration official] has emphasized that we need to do at the same time.</p>



<p>One is resolve the current cases and bring people home and, at the same time, add to the costs for those who engage in this behavior through the executive order; add to the transparency for American travelers and for the world by the new indicator; and overall, reduce the next generation, so to speak, of cases from arising in the first place.</p>



<p>And then, in terms of the definition of a “wrongful detainee,” that is something that is set out in the Levinson Act by federal law with a number of factors that the State Department is to consider in any particular case in reaching a conclusion as to whether a given American held abroad and acknowledged as such by a foreign government should be deemed wrongfully detained.</p>



<p>So we wouldn’t be able to redefine that via executive order, but [senior administration official] and others across the State Department are day-to-day, week-to-week implementing that in some very effective and informative ways that I think take that law, and the powerful advocacy that helped to get it passed by the Levinson family and so many other families, and showing the value of having that designation and entrenched in the U.S. code, the factors that inform it.</p>



<p>But let me turn to others for anything they’d like to add as well.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Hi, it’s [senior administration official].&nbsp; I’ll jump in.&nbsp; The wrongful termination process, I guess you can say we will pull up a case, and then it becomes ongoing research to determine whether it starts to, using the Levinson criteria, look like a wrongful detention.</p>



<p>We’ve had some cases go very fast in that we get information, and it seems like the information is self-evident, and that leads to a rather quick determination.&nbsp; We have other cases where we’re constantly bringing in information and it finally, to an extent, kind of crosses the bar and it becomes a wrongful detention but only after more information was gathered.</p>



<p>And I can tell you that we never take a case and put it away.&nbsp; Once we take a look at a case, we’re constantly trying to, like, as I say, vacuum in information, whether it’s from family members, newspaper reports, the intelligence community, to see if we can get that little extra piece of evidence that might raise it to the bar of being a wrongful detention.</p>



<p>Some cases never really rise to that level because, for some reason or not, they’re not wrongful.&nbsp; You know, we keep getting information that doesn’t quite reach the level of being recommended for determination.</p>



<p>On the Fogel case, I probably shouldn’t talk about any cases that are ongoing.&nbsp; We’ve been looking at that for a while now.&nbsp; I spent a few hours on the Fogel case just last week trying to get more information on it.&nbsp; So it’s ongoing and active; we’re looking at it.&nbsp; But I’d rather not go into any more details on specific cases.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey, thanks so much for addressing this call.&nbsp; And based on those comments, I’m hoping you can provide some kind of comment.&nbsp; But I mean, is there anything that you could say in regards to how these efforts would impact Brittney Griner’s case or cases like hers, or anything you can say on efforts to secure her release?&nbsp; Any positive progress, discussion of a prisoner swap, for example?&nbsp; I would appreciate anything that you can share, even in general.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; Again, I’m happy to start, and then we’ll let colleagues jump in.&nbsp;</p>



<p>First of all, with respect to the executive order, there are a number of ways in which it would affect cases like that, cases in the wrongful detainee category.&nbsp; The executive order directs those across the executive branch to share consistent and accurate information with the families of those who are deemed wrongfully detained to ensure that they receive support and assistance throughout the ordeal and to work with parts of our government to try to impose costs on those responsible.</p>



<p>And as I indicated, those responsible can be government officials, and it’s really quite expansive language: “foreign persons determined…to be responsible for or complicit in, to have directly or indirectly engaged in…to be responsible for ordering, controlling or otherwise directing the hostage taking of a U.S. national or the wrongful detention of a U.S. national abroad,” or to have “attempted” to do so or indeed to have been the “leader…of an entity that has engaged” in that sort of activity.</p>



<p>And so as this authority gets implemented, it will, we hope, have a couple of effects.&nbsp; One is to impose consequences on those who’ve been part of this just abominable, inhumane practice; and in so doing, to generate over time a deterrent from others becoming part of that practice, as well, whether that’s at a broad leadership level or whether that’s particular individuals who realize there can be very personalized repercussions for engaging in this sort of activity.</p>



<p>And then, with respect to the travel indicator, of course this will help increase the transparency to Americans as they think about destinations, so they can factor in the State Department’s indication that, at least as of tomorrow &#8212; and this will be reviewed, as you heard &#8212; there are six countries where the risk of being wrongfully detained, held by a foreign government in order to be exploited or used as a bargaining chip, is very real for Americans in particular.</p>



<p>Let me invite colleagues to add to that as well.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; I think you covered it perfectly.&nbsp; Nothing to add.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Yeah, thanks.&nbsp; I agree entirely.&nbsp; The one thing I would flag is that the “D” indicator is a way of increasing transparency for the U.S. public traveling.&nbsp; We have for a long time highlighted the risk of wrongful detention in certain countries, but by flagging it in this very clear way, we are hopeful that there will be fewer cases of U.S. travelers choosing to go to certain countries where this risk is greater than in others.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, guys, thank you so much for doing this.&nbsp; [Senior administration official], my first question is for you.&nbsp; You mentioned that sanctions might not work or be applicable for every single case.&nbsp; So I’m wondering if there are particular cases or clusters of cases in which you think sanctions might be most appropriate or most relevant, or if there’s a particular impetus for this part of the EO.</p>



<p>And then, [senior administration official], this notion of sharing additional information, being transparent with families, was, of course, a signature element of Presidential Policy Directive 30, which you were obviously an instrumental player in seven years ago.&nbsp; So I’m wondering why this element is being introduced again.&nbsp; Is there a sense that that action from 2015 didn’t go far enough in sharing information?&nbsp;</p>



<p>I’m just kind of curious whether there’s particular aspects or element or fact that wound up leading to this new action. Thank you so much.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Hey, Eric.&nbsp; It’s [senior administration official].&nbsp; I’ll jump on and then they’ll turn over to [senior administration official], if that’s okay &#8212; although I may be asking &#8212; answering part of the question that you might have directed to him.</p>



<p>I mean, the Levinson Act, essentially, in public law, asks us to look into creating a sanctioning authority and sanctioning ability.&nbsp; And in wrestling with that over almost the last year and a half, this is the road that we’ve taken, and that seems to be a pretty good one.</p>



<p>So if there’s a reason why it’s coming out now, it’s really because it’s finally done.&nbsp; And it’s something that we’ve been working on based on what we were directed to by public law.</p>



<p>In terms of whether it can be used, I mean, obviously, I might have a country or two or three that I might be thinking about, but to be honest, I want to talk to the families.&nbsp; The families follow this case, as we do.&nbsp; We follow the cases, as you can imagine.&nbsp; But the families have a particular amount of depth to each one of their cases, for obvious reasons, and we would like to, in our engagements with them, kind of see who they think might be up for the targeting process.&nbsp; And we’d like to work with them a little bit.</p>



<p>So even though I might have a country or two where I think this might be a tool that could be put into action, I think I’m going to, kind of, withhold my fire for now until we can talk to the families and build up a strategy, because I don’t want to do that &#8212; what is it called? &#8212; like, “ready, fire, aim.”&nbsp; I want to do “ready, aim, fire.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>I want to make sure that this is integrated into our ongoing strategy and that it has impact.&nbsp; What I don’t want to do is do something where we use a pretty powerful tool but do not get the result that we want to achieve, and that’s bringing people home and then creating that deterrent effect.</p>



<p>[Senior administration official], can I turn it over to you to see if you can hit some of this and his other question?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Great answers.&nbsp; And I’ll just flesh out a little bit on one of them, totally consistent with what [senior administration official] has said, which is: The focus of Presidential Policy Directive 30, in many ways, not in all ways, was in hostage cases rather than detainee cases. Now, it accounted for the latter.&nbsp; It specifically assigned the role of Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs to include working diplomatic engagements for cases in which a foreign government confirms, acknowledges that it’s detained a U.S. national but our government regards such detention as unlawful or wrongful.&nbsp; That is language that, as [senior administration official] said, was then picked up by Congress in the Levinson Act.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And indeed, PPD 30 did take account of the fact there would need to be family engagement for those cases as well.&nbsp; It explicitly made available to the State Department the family engagement coordinator that was being built at the time at the Hostage Recovery Fusion Cell.</p>



<p>But over time, the cases that are in the detainee category &#8212; the “foreign government held,” “foreign government acknowledge” category &#8212; have risen in both number and degree of difficulty.&nbsp; And that is something that Americans see every day with some of the cases that are in the headlines.</p>



<p>And so the Levinson Act took an important step forward in entrenching some of the reforms set out in PPD 30, not just for hostage cases, but also for detainee cases.&nbsp; This implements that; it takes it forward.</p>



<p>And indeed, in some ways, one key theme of both the executive order that will be announced tomorrow, as well as the “D” indicator, is that they continue to elevate the priority being placed on the “government held,” “government acknowledged” wrongful detainee cases and enhance the toolbox available to us across the government in addressing those cases, which ultimately means resolving the current ones and trying to warn about and deter future ones.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; And that is all the questions that we have time for.&nbsp; [Moderator], we’ll turn it back over to you.</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Thank you so much.&nbsp; And thank you, everyone, for joining this call this evening.&nbsp; As a reminder of the ground rules, the call was held on background with the speakers attributable to “senior administration officials,” and it is under embargo until tomorrow morning at 9:00 a.m. Eastern.</p>



<p>Thank you very much.&nbsp; I hope everyone has a wonderful evening.</p>
