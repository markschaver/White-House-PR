<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Vice President Kamala Harris Announces Release of Plan During White House Event with Secretary Marcia L. Fudge, White House Domestic Policy Advisor Susan Rice, and Americans Impacted by Bias in the Appraisal Process</em></p>



<p>On June 1, 2021—the centennial of the Tulsa Race Massacre—President Biden announced the creation of the Interagency Task Force on Property Appraisal and Valuation Equity (PAVE) to develop a transformative set of actions to root out racial and ethnic bias in home valuations. Today, the Task Force is releasing the <a href="https://pave.hud.gov/">PAVE Action Plan</a> which, when enacted, represents the most wide-ranging set of reforms ever put forward to advance equity in the home appraisal process. The Task Force is co-chaired by U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Secretary Marcia L. Fudge and Domestic Policy Advisor Susan Rice.</p>



<p>A home appraisal is a critical element of the homebuying and lending process, intended to provide an independent, fair, and objective estimate of the market value of a property so that lenders can accurately evaluate risk. &nbsp;Homeownership is the primary contributor to wealth building for Black and brown households and continues to hold promise for building multigenerational wealth and housing stability for households of color. But, bias in home valuations limits the ability of Black and brown families to enjoy the financial returns associated with homeownership, thereby contributing to the already sprawling racial wealth gap. Today, the median white family holds eight times the wealth of the typical Black family and five times the wealth of the typical Latino family. According to a recent <a href="http://racialwealthaudit.org/downloads/RacialWealthGap.pdf">study</a>, eliminating racial disparities in the amount of wealth families gain from owning a home would narrow the wealth gap by an additional 16 percent between Black and white households and by an additional 41 percent between Latino and white households.</p>



<p>Just since the Task Force was launched, there have been numerous reports of Black homeowners receiving higher appraisals only after taking down family photos and having white families represent them in their stead. &nbsp;New research shows that mis-valuation in communities of color can be widespread. A recent report from <a href="https://www.freddiemac.com/research/insight/20210920-home-appraisals">Freddie Mac</a> found that appraisals for home purchases in majority-Black and majority-Latino neighborhoods were roughly twice as likely to result in a value below the actual contract price (the amount a buyer is willing to pay for the property), compared to appraisals in predominantly white neighborhoods. Similarly, a recent study from <a href="https://www.fanniemae.com/research-and-insights/publications/appraising-the-appraisal">Fannie Mae</a> examining refinance transactions found that white-owned homes are much more likely than Black-owned homes to be appraised at values that exceed algorithmic predictions.</p>



<p><strong>PAVE Action Plan</strong></p>



<p>The Action Plan details a set of commitments and actions, most of which can be taken using existing federal authorities, that will help every American to have a chance to build generational wealth through homeownership. You can read the full action plan at PAVE.HUD.gov.</p>



<p>Member agencies will take the following actions:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><strong>Make the appraisal industry more accountable.</strong> The Action Plan lays out steps to enhance oversight and accountability of the appraisal industry, which has long operated in a relatively closed and self-regulated framework and has not been effective at addressing deep-rooted inequities. Specifically, it commits federal agencies to create a legislative proposal to modernize the governance structure of the appraisal industry, and improves coordination and collaboration between federal enforcement agencies to better identify and redress discrimination in appraisals.</li><li><strong>Empower consumers with information and assistance.</strong> The Action Plan includes concrete efforts to empower homeowners and homebuyers on effective steps they can take when they receive a valuation that is lower than expected. For example, federal agencies commit to issue guidance and implement new policies to improve the process by which a valuation may be reconsidered.</li><li><strong>Prevent algorithmic bias in home valuation</strong><strong>.</strong> Federal agencies that regulate mortgage financing commit to including a nondiscrimination quality control standard as part of a forthcoming proposed rule establishing quality control standards on AVMs (Automated Valuation Models). This will ensure AVMs do not rely upon biased data that could replicate past discrimination.</li><li><strong>Cultivate an appraiser profession that is well-trained and looks like the communities it serves.</strong><em> </em>According to the Department of Labor’s Bureau of Labor Statistics, the appraiser/assessor profession is roughly 97 percent white, making it one of the least diverse professions in the country. The Action Plan lays out a series of actions to remove unnecessary educational and experience requirements that make it difficult for underrepresented groups to access the profession and to strengthen anti-bias, fair housing, and fair lending training of existing appraisers.</li><li><strong>Leverage federal data and expertise to inform policy, practice, and research on appraisal bias.</strong> The Action Plan proposes the development of an aggregated database of federal appraisal data to better study, understand, and address appraisal bias, complemented by a working group composed of subject matter experts from stakeholder agencies to develop a research agenda on appraisal bias.</li></ul>



<p>The PAVE Task Force has already made significant progress, and its commitment is ongoing. The Task Force identified several additional policy initiatives that may have the potential to make a significant difference in ensuring fair and accurate home valuations for all communities. These policy ideas require in-depth evaluation and research, greater input from stakeholders, and further exploration. The Task Force is committed to doing this work. As the Task Force transitions into the next phase of its work to advance equity in home appraisals, it will continue seeking opportunities to collaborate with lending institutions, philanthropy groups, academia, civil rights groups, advocates, and industry associations to create a coordinated approach in tackling this issue.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">James S. Brady Press Briefing Room</p>



<p>1:48 P.M. EDT<br><br>MR. MEAGHER:&nbsp; Hello, everyone. Good afternoon.&nbsp; As you can see things are changing and moving pretty rapidly around here today.<br><br>Obviously, we&#8217;ve had some last-minute adju- &#8212; adjustments to the briefing, which is why I&#8217;m up here today.&nbsp; I know folks might have some questions after the statement that we just released from Jen.&nbsp; And we in the Press Office are going to strive throughout the rest of the day to get you the answers to the questions you might have.<br><br>A few additions beyond Jen&#8217;s statement that I can provide right now.&nbsp; No members of the press who attended the briefing yesterday are considered to be close contacts.&nbsp; We are considering con- &#8212; or we are currently conducting contact tracing, and any member of the press who is considered to be a close contact will be contacted.&nbsp; But if a close contact is determined, it would &#8212; it would not be through yesterday&#8217;s briefing.&nbsp; So, we just wanted to be clear about that.<br><br>I&#8217;m going to speak briefly about the first day and a half of Judge Jackson&#8217;s committee hearing, and then I&#8217;m going to pass it over to National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, who will make some remarks at the top and then he&#8217;s happy to take some questions on the trip.&nbsp; And he has a hard out where &#8212; I&#8217;ll call it.<br><br>And then again, please let us know if you have any follow ups after the briefing.&nbsp; We&#8217;ll strive to get you answers, and we appreciate everybody&#8217;s flexibility today.&nbsp;<br><br>With that, just a couple of things from the first day and a half of Judge Jackson&#8217;s committee hearing.&nbsp; The President watched portions of Judge Jackson&#8217;s hearing yesterday and today and is proud of the way she is showcasing her extraordinary qualifications, her experience, and her even-handedness.&nbsp; Her dedication to following the facts, the law, and our Constitution as an independent judge is clear.<br><br>He was also moved by the grace and dignity she has shown, the deference to senators, and the level of detail she is offering, reinforcing the value of her experience, her intellect, and the strength of her character.&nbsp;<br><br>The President was particularly struck when, reacting to Senator Leahy raising the broad support she&#8217;d received from the law enforcement community, Judge Jackson spoke about her family members who have served as police officers, saying, &#8220;I know what it&#8217;s like to have loved ones who go off to protect and to serve, and the fear of not knowing whether or not they&#8217;re going to come home again because of crime in the community.&nbsp; Those are not abstract concepts or political slogans to me.&#8221;<br><br>As a former Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, President Biden also appreciated her respect for the intent of lawmakers and the text of the law.&nbsp; He appreciated Judge Jackson&#8217;s commitment to stay in the lane of judges prescribed by the Constitution and her highlighting the importance of precedent.<br><br>He was also struck by how she swiftly dismantled conspiracy theories put forward in bad faith.&nbsp; They&#8217;ve been debunked by numerous fact checks, experts, and the record itself.<br><br>In selecting Judge Jackson, President Biden sought the opinions of Republicans and Democrats, who made clear they wanted someone have deep experience in the mold of Justice Breyer.<br><br>Today&#8217;s testimony and Judge Jackson&#8217;s endorsements by leading conservative jurists and some of the biggest law enforcement organizations in our country make clear she is indeed in Justice Breyer&#8217;s mold.&nbsp;<br><br>And with that, I&#8217;ll turn it over to Jake, who has a topper for you, and then he&#8217;ll take some questions.&nbsp; Thanks.<br><br>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; Good afternoon, everybody.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll make a few comments, and then, as Chris said, I&#8217;d be happy to take your questions.<br><br>The President is heading to Europe tomorrow to reinforce the incredible unity we built with Allies and partners in response to Russia&#8217;s brutal invasion of Ukraine and to consult on next steps.<br><br>Let me take a moment to set the context for this trip. Russia intended to accomplish three basic objectives in launching its unprovoked attack against Ukraine: first, to subjugate Ukraine; second, to enhance Russian power and prestige; and third, to divide and weaken the West.<br><br>Russia has thus far manifestly failed to accomplish all three objectives.&nbsp; In fact, it has thus far achieved the opposite.<br><br>On the first, the brave citizens of Ukraine are refusing to submit.&nbsp; They&#8217;re fighting back.&nbsp; They&#8217;re defending their homes.&nbsp; They&#8217;re defending their cities.&nbsp; And although Russia may take more territory in these brutal military operations, it will never take the country away from the Ukrainian people.<br><br>On the second, Russian power and prestige has been badly depleted.&nbsp; The Russian military has dramatically underperformed.&nbsp; The Russian economy has been rocked by powerful sanctions.&nbsp; The Russian high-tech and defense sectors are being choked off from key inputs.&nbsp; And Russia is a pariah in the international community.<br><br>On the third, the nations of the free world are more united, more determined, and more purposeful than at any point in recent memory.<br><br>For our part, since President Biden and the United States began warning the world of impending Russian aggression back in November, we have clearly and consistently pursued three lines of effort: first, help Ukraine defend itself by supplying weapons and military equipment; second, impose severe and escalating economic costs on Russia through the application of unprecedented sanctions in close coordination with Allies and partners in Europe, the Indo-Pacific, and other parts of the world; and third, fortify NATO and the Western Alliance by enhancing our force posture on the eastern flank and making our allies more resilient against other forms of Russian aggression.<br><br>We&#8217;ve made decisive moves on all three fronts, and President Biden&#8217;s trip will involve further actions on each of these three fronts.<br><br>He will attend an emergency NATO Summit, joined by the leaders of the other 29 NATO Allies.&nbsp; He will join the G7 leaders.&nbsp; And he will address the 27 leaders of the European Union at a session of the European Council.&nbsp; He will have the opportunity to coordinate on the next phase of military assistance to Ukraine.&nbsp;<br><br>He will join our partners in imposing further sanctions on Russia and tightening the existing sanctions to crack down on evasion and to ensure robust enforcement.&nbsp;<br><br>He will work with Allies on longer-term adjustments to NATO force posture on the eastern flank.&nbsp; He will announce joint action on enhancing European energy security and reducing Europe’s dependence on Russian gas at long last.&nbsp;<br><br>He will announce further American contributions to a coordinated humanitarian response to ease the suffering of civilians inside Ukraine and to respond to the growing flow of refugees.<br><br>From Brussels, President Biden will travel to Poland, where he will engage with U.S. troops who are now helping to defend NATO territory, and he will meet with experts involved in the humanitarian response.<br><br>He will also hold a bilateral meeting with President Duda of Poland.<br><br>I&#8217;ll leave further details on the schedule and program for each of these aspects of the trip to our trusty Communications and Press team.<br><br>Let me close with this: There will be hard days ahead in Ukraine &#8212; hardest for the Ukrainian troops on the frontlines and the civilians under Russian bombardment.&nbsp; This war will not end easily or rapidly.<br><br>For the past few months, the West has been united.&nbsp; The President is traveling to Europe to ensure we stay united, to cement our collective resolve, to send a powerful message that we are prepared and committed to this for as long as it takes, and to advance our response on all three critical fronts that I&#8217;ve described: helping the Ukrainian people defend themselves, imposing and increasing costs on Russia, and reinforcing the Western alliance.<br><br>And with that, I&#8217;d be happy to take your questions.<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jake.&nbsp; The Russians and the Hungarians seem to be reluctant on imposing a ban on importing Russian oil and gas.&nbsp; Will this weaken the sanctions?&nbsp;<br><br>And would you call on the groups that the President is going to meet to exclude Russia from the G20, of course, group?&nbsp;<br><br>And do you think that an agreement with Iran could be reached without Russia?<br><br>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; So, when the President announced that the United States was going to ban the import of Russian oil and gas, he was very clear.&nbsp; He said that the United States is uniquely positioned: We are an energy producer.&nbsp; We can do this.&nbsp; We can take this step of banning the import of Russian oil and gas and coal and be able to withstand it, have resilience against it.&nbsp;<br><br>But he also recognized quite explicitly in that statement that some of our European Allies and partners would not be able to follow suit, and he was not going to pressure them to do so.&nbsp;<br><br>From his perspective, what we have achieved with our European partners &#8212; in terms of financial sanctions, export controls, and other measures to hit the Russian economy hard &#8212; have had unprecedented impact on a large economy at a scale we have never seen before.&nbsp;<br><br>And so, he believes that that is in fact increasing the costs on Russia; it is sharpening the choice for Russia.&nbsp; And he feels very good about where things stand today in terms of the unity and resolve of the Western alliance on sanctions.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>And as I mentioned in my opener, we will have more to say on sanctions in the coming days.<br><br>On the question of the G20, I will just say this: We believe that it cannot be business as usual for Russia in international institutions and in the international community.&nbsp; But as for particular institutions and particular decisions, we&#8217;d like to consult with our Allies, consult with our partners in those institutions before making any further pronouncements.<br><br>Finally, we believe that if there is an Iran nuclear deal that meets the standards the President has set to verifiably block the pathway of Iran to get to a nuclear weapon and put this program back in the box after President Trump let it out of the box when he left the deal back in 2018, we will do that deal because we believe it is in the American national security interest to do so.&nbsp; But we will not do that deal until it meets those objectives.<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, thank you very much.&nbsp; If you can tell us anything more about the sanctions &#8212; you did just say “further sanctions” &#8212; anything more about what areas that could be in, that would be great.&nbsp;<br><br>And the other thing is, there was a report out that British troops are basically secretly training Ukrainians to use this very sophisticated anti-aircraft weapons &#8212; the “Star,&#8221; I think, or “Start” or something like that.&nbsp;<br><br>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; Right.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are there any U.S. troops in Eastern Europe or anywhere else currently training Ukrainians (inaudible)?<br><br>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; So, as for the first question, I&#8217;m not going to get ahead of an announcement which will be rolled out in conjunction with our Allies on Thursday when the President has the opportunity to speak with them.&nbsp; That&#8217;s on a further package of sanctions.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>What I will say is that one of the key elements of that announcement will focus not just on adding new sanctions, but on ensuring that there is joint effort to crack down on inva- &#8212; evasion, on sanctions busting, on any attempt by any country to help Russia basically undermine, weaken, or get around the sanctions.&nbsp; That is an important part of this next phase.<br><br>We have applied an enormous amount of economic pressure.&nbsp; And in order to sustain and escalate that pressure over time, part of that is about new designations, new targets, but a big part of it is about effective enforcement and evasion &#8212; applying the lessons that we&#8217;ve learned from other circumstances where we have, in fact, imposed sanctions on countries.&nbsp; So, stay tuned for that.<br><br>On the question of U.S. troops, we do not have U.S. troops currently training Ukrainians.&nbsp; We do not have U.S. troops on the territory of Ukraine.&nbsp; We do, of course, have U.S. troops defending NATO territory, providing reassurance to our Allies, deterring Russian aggression.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>And, of course, the United States is playing a key role not just in the direct provision of military equipment to Ukraine but in the facilitation of military equipment provided by many of our Allies as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Yes.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, sir.&nbsp; Two questions, quickly.&nbsp; Moments ago, you said at the beginning that Russia would never take Ukraine.&nbsp; But does the President believe that Ukraine can win a military victory here?&nbsp; And if so, why haven&#8217;t we heard that from him thus far?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>And then my second question is: With regards to Russia and partnership with the United States and certain institutions, what does the President hope that Russia can bring to the Iran nuclear deal?&nbsp; What do they have to bring to the table after they have rightfully been made a pariah on the world stage?<br><br>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; So, I can describe to you what happened with the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action back in 2015.&nbsp;<br><br>One of the key roles that Russia played in the implementation of that deal was that Russia actually accepted the enriched uranium from Iran so that Iran’s stockpile &#8212; stockpile stayed below 300 kilograms total, meaning that stockpile was so small that Iran could not swiftly break out to a nuclear weapon.&nbsp; That is a key part of how we ensured that Iran&#8217;s nuclear program was in a box.<br><br>Now, we don&#8217;t have to rely on any given country for any particular element of the deal, but that is a role that Russia played in the past &#8212; a practical role that didn&#8217;t have necessarily political significance but did have that practical significance.&nbsp;<br><br>What I said was that Russia is never going to take Ukraine away from the Ukrainian people &#8212; never going to be able to subjugate the Ukrainian people.&nbsp; That was not a statement about particular slice of territory that a Russian advance could occupy for a period of time or about a particular battle that some Russian element could win.&nbsp;<br><br>I would refer you over to the Pentagon in terms of the best military analysis for how particular battles in particular fronts will play out.&nbsp;<br><br>But what &#8212; I will say this: Whether Russia takes a city or takes a town or takes more territory, they are never going to be able to achieve the purpose that they set out, which was to subjugate this country, to bring this country to heel, because the Ukrainian people have made very clear that they will not be subjugated, no matter what it takes.&nbsp;<br><br>Yes.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jake, thank you for being here.&nbsp; But to follow up on that question, is it the policy of this government that Ukraine should win this, it should reject Russia and regain its sovereignty and its freedom?<br><br>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; We&#8217;ve said from the outset that we are unwavering in our commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity within the internationally recognized borders of Ukraine.&nbsp; We remain committed to that as our proposition for this.&nbsp;<br><br>But in the immediate day-to-day of this conflict, our focus is on ensuring that Ukraine has the tools that it needs to defend itself and to be able to effectively ensure that Russia cannot achieve its objectives in Ukraine.&nbsp; That&#8217;s what we&#8217;re focused on right now.&nbsp;<br><br>But on the basic proposition of Russia&#8217;s &#8212; of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, from day one of the Biden administration, we have not wavered an inch on that.<br><br>Yes.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me follow up on one thing, Jake &#8212; on Article 5 and any cyberattack that comes now.&nbsp; Obviously, Russians have done it before; it wasn&#8217;t an Article 5 issue then.&nbsp; Does something in Ukraine now change the contour of a cyberattack against any member nation of a &#8212; of NATO become an Article 5 issue &#8212;<br><br>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; So, in the June summit last &#8212;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; having the President raise that just yesterday as dramatically as he did?<br><br>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; So, last June, when the NATO leaders gathered for the NATO Summit, President Biden &#8212; consulting with them, we put out a statement that spoke to cyberattacks and their relationship to Article 5.&nbsp; And we could see circumstances in which a collective response by the Alliance to a cyberattack would be called by an Ally.&nbsp; That is absolutely something where we and other countries could bring capabilities to bear to help a country both defend itself and respond to a particular cyberattack.&nbsp;<br><br>Now, that&#8217;s not necessarily the same thing as a military response.&nbsp; That response could take many different forms.&nbsp; But we have made clear through NATO documents now &#8212; not just last year, but going back years &#8212; that cybersecurity is an Alliance issue, is &#8212; it is an issue where, collectively, NATO is prepared to pull together both to enhance resilience, enhance defenses, and, if necessary, use the appropriate tools to respond.<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jake.&nbsp; It’s been just over a week since you met with your Chinese counterpart, a couple of days since the President spoke with President Xi.&nbsp; Have you seen any indications that China will or will not provide assistance to Russia?&nbsp;<br><br>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; I can&#8217;t make predictions going forward.&nbsp; What I can tell you is we have not seen since those meetings or since the President&#8217;s conversation with Xi the provision of military equipment by China to Russia.&nbsp; But, of course, this is something we are monitoring closely.&nbsp; We will continue to monitor it.&nbsp; And the President made clear to President Xi the implications and consequences of any such provision of equipment, and they very well understand one another.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And where does this fall on the agenda at the NATO Summit?&nbsp; Will there be an effort to try to put specific concrete steps in place if China does provide that assistance?<br><br>MR.&nbsp; SULLIVAN:&nbsp; The President will certainly consult on the question of China&#8217;s potential participation in the conflict of Ukraine while he&#8217;s in Brussels &#8212; he&#8217;ll do so with NATO.&nbsp; He&#8217;ll also do so when he addresses the 27 leaders of the European Union, because, on April 1st, the European Union is having a summit with China.&nbsp; And so, this will be an opportunity &#8212; Thursday &#8212; for the United States and our European partners to coordinate closely on what our message is.&nbsp; We believe we&#8217;re very much on the same page with our European partners, and we will be speaking with one voice on this issue.<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, I just wanted to follow up on your comment about shoring up the eastern flank of NATO.&nbsp; Are you &#8212; do you anticipate additional U.S. troop deployments to Europe?<br><br>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; Well, I think there are two issues that are important to lay out.&nbsp; One is: What&#8217;s required in the immediate term?&nbsp; And right now, Secretary of Defense, the Supreme Allied Commander of Europe believe that they have effective posture today for what&#8217;s necessary today.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>But, of course, that could evolve in the coming days and weeks, depending on Russia&#8217;s actions and depending on the overall threat picture.<br><br>The second is: What is the longer-term force posture &#8212; not just for this contingency, this emergency, this invasion, but over the course of time?&nbsp; That is something the President will discuss with his Allies at the NATO Summit on Thursday.</p>



<p>Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; And if I might ask a quick follow-up on Russian troop casualties &#8212; a Russian media report that the outlet blamed on hackers and withdrew suggested that suggested that almost 10,000 Russian servicemen had been killed and 16,000 had been wounded in Ukraine.&nbsp; Does that &#8212; is your assessment that that number is realistic?&nbsp; Or how bad do you think the casualty situation is for Russia?</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; I’d refer you to the Pentagon for precise casualty figures.&nbsp; We do believe it numbers in the thousands.&nbsp; But it is a necessarily imprecise analysis from our part to be able to get, you know, that number down to the precise figure.&nbsp; So, I would refer you over to the Pentagon for that.</p>



<p>Yeah?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President said yesterday, Jake, that cyberwarfare is a capability Putin has but has decided to not use yet in this iteration of this war, but administration sources have told us the Russians have this multi-phase plan to target critical infrastructure that is already underway.&nbsp;<br><br>I&#8217;ll give you a couple of specifics: Two weeks prior to the invasion, 21 U.S. energy companies targeted by hackers; they’re involved with LNG production.&nbsp;<br><br>March 9th, CISA and the FBI began working with an unnamed American pharmaceutical company whose top execs were targeted with malicious phishing attacks.&nbsp; Internally, the administration has attributed that to Russian intelligence.</p>



<p>I have a list of stuff that goes on and on here.&nbsp; Suffice it to say, this &#8212; how did these acts not constitute cyberwarfare so far already?</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; So, first, the President put out a statement yesterday &#8212; a very strong, clearly worded statement &#8212; in which he said, based on evolving intelligence, we believe that attacks could occur.</p>



<p>Now, the Russians have spent years preparing the ground for attacks &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But do you &#8212;&nbsp;</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; &#8212; trying to get inside systems.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; is the position that they are not already underway?&nbsp; Just want to clarify.</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; Well, I &#8212; what I think we would distinguish between is gaining access to a system, which could be used for a variety of purposes &#8212; intelligence collection or mere preparation for a future attack &#8212; and the actual disruptive, destructive type of attack of the kind you saw that shut down the Colonial Pipeline last year, for example, or attack JBS Foods.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s really that latter thing that we have not yet seen.</p>



<p>But how one defines cyberwarefare [sic] &#8212; warfare or cyberattacks, of course, is going to differ across individuals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The distinction the President was making was the distinction between all of that preparatory work, which has been ongoing for years and has, in fact, intensified, and the type of destruction or disruption &#8212; the launch of a particular form of malware, for example &#8212; that would result in the kinds of physical effects we&#8217;ve seen in past attacks.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So no successful attacks yet?&nbsp; Just want to clar- &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jake.&nbsp; I wanted to ask about talk &#8212; concerns about the use of nuclear weapons, including possibly smaller nuclear weapons.&nbsp; Can you just address those concerns and talk about how that might come up on this trip?</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; Well, President Putin, in the early days of the conflict, actually raised the specter of the potential use of nuclear weapons.&nbsp; It is something that we do have to be concerned about.&nbsp; Based on our current analysis, we have not changed our nuclear posture to date.&nbsp; But we are constantly monitoring for that potential contingency.&nbsp; And of course, we take it as seriously as one could possibly take it.</p>



<p>We will be consulting with Allies and partners on that potential contingency, among a range of others, and discussing what our potential responses are.&nbsp; But I&#8217;m not going to speak to that from this podium today.&nbsp; I&#8217;m going to let the President have the opportunity to speak with his fellow colleagues on what is a very weighty matter.</p>



<p>Yeah?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen was asked yesterday &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are Vladimir Putin’s days numbered, Jake?&nbsp; Are Vladimir Putin’s days in power numbered?<br><br>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; From our perspective, what happens with respect to the Russian political system is something that will be worked out inside Russia.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>What we can do is put forward our basic three lines of effort.&nbsp; That&#8217;s what we&#8217;re doing: helping the Ukrainians defend themselves, fortifying the NATO Alliance, and imposing costs and consequences.</p>



<p>MR. MEAGHER:&nbsp; We’ve got time for one more.&nbsp; We’ve got time for one more.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have two questions on Russia and North Korea and China.&nbsp; There is a report today that the North Korea’s cyber-hacking organization is related to Russians&#8217; cyber-criminal organization.&nbsp; Do you have any information on that?</p>



<p>And I follow up next.</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; I’m sorry, can you just repeat the question?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; North Korea’s cyber-hacking organization is related to Russian’s cyber-criminal organization.&nbsp; Do you have any information on this?</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; All I can say, generally, is that North Korea’s cyber capabilities have &#8212; have been manifest in the world and they work with all kinds of cyber criminals around the world, including Russian cyber criminals.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve got nothing further for you on that today.</p>



<p>Yeah, I’ll take one more.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jake.&nbsp; Do have any expectation &#8212; do you have any specific comments or expectations on the meeting between &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What specifically does &#8212; what specifically &#8212;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; between President Xi and President Zelenskyy that&#8217;s scheduled to happen soon?</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; Sorry, I told her &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, I’m sorry.</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; &#8212; that I would call on her &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jake.</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; &#8212; so I&#8217;ve got to &#8212; I&#8217;ve got to let her ask the question.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What specifically does the President hope to accomplish when he&#8217;s in Poland?&nbsp; And why did he feel that it would be helpful for him to go to Warsaw at this time, particularly when the Vice President was there less than two weeks ago?</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; So, first, Poland has taken the brunt of the humanitarian impact outside of Ukraine in terms of the refugee flows.&nbsp; Poland is where the United States has surged a significant number of forces to be able to help defend and shore up the eastern flank.&nbsp; Poland has to contend not just with the war in Ukraine but with Russia&#8217;s military deployments to Belarus, which have fundamentally changed the security equation there.</p>



<p>And so, for all of those reasons, we feel that it is the right place for him to go to be able to see troops, to be able to see humanitarian experts, and to be able to meet with a frontline and very vulnerable ally.&nbsp;<br><br>So, I’ll &#8212; I&#8217;ll leave it at that, guys.&nbsp; Thanks.<br><br>MR. MEAGHER:&nbsp; Thank you, everybody.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jake, is he meeting with refugees?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>(Mr. Sullivan returns to the podium to retrieve his facemask.)</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; Oh, sorry.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is he meeting with refugees, Jake?<br><br>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; We’ll &#8212; we’ll &#8212;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I thought you said &#8212; Psaki said that you&#8217;d tell us &#8212; you &#8212; you might be able to tell us today.</p>



<p>MR. SULLIVAN:&nbsp; So, I think I said at the outset that we’ll go through the precise details of the schedule (inaudible).<br><br>2:12 P.M. EDT</p>

<p>Today, in preparation for travel to Europe, I took a PCR test this morning. That test came back positive, which means I will be adhering to CDC guidance and no longer be traveling on the President’s trip to Europe.</p>



<p>I had two socially-distanced meetings with the President yesterday, and the President is not considered a close contact as defined by CDC guidance. I am sharing the news of my positive test today out of an abundance of transparency.</p>



<p>The President tested negative today via PCR test.</p>



<p>Thanks to the vaccine, I have only experienced mild symptoms. In alignment with White House COVID-19 protocols, I will work from home and plan to return to work in person at the conclusion of a five-day isolation period and a negative test.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Business Roundtable Office<br>Washington, D.C.</p>



<p>6:10 P.M. EDT<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; My name is Joe Biden, and I come from Delaware which has more corporations incorporated than all of the rest of the country combined.&nbsp; (Laughter.)</p>



<p>And I know the Business Roundtable because in the days when I first ran for office &#8212; (clears throat) &#8212; excuse me &#8212; in 1972, for the United States Senate, the DuPont company was the eighth-largest corporation in America.&nbsp; As they say in Delaware, they were the good old days.&nbsp; But all kidding aside, thank you for having me.&nbsp; You&#8217;re a hell of an organization.&nbsp; I appreciate it.</p>



<p>And I want to thank you, Josh.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve known each other a long, long time.&nbsp; And, you know, I&#8217;ve hosted CEO roundtables, you know, in the White House, including with many of you over the years.&nbsp; And we&#8217;ve worked together on the American Rescue Plan, on COVID, on infrastructure, supply chains, innovation, on climate and clean energy, reducing costs and a whole lot more.</p>



<p>And our strategy has worked, I believe, and I think it’s still working.&nbsp; 6.7 million jobs last year –- the most ever created in one year; more than 7 million now.&nbsp; 678,000 created just last month, in one month.&nbsp; Unemployment down to 3.8 percent.&nbsp; Our economy grew at 5.7 percent last year, and the strongest in nearly 40 years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And we reduced the deficit, we reduced the deficit &#8212; I want to say it again: We reduced the deficit by $360 billion last year, notwithstanding all that I hear on some channels when I turn them on.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re on track to reduce it by over $1 trillion this year.</p>



<p>And that groundwork has positioned our economy to deal with &#8212; with the global problem of inflation, which is real &#8212; a lot of people are being hurt by it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And it’s underscored that America is a great place to invest.</p>



<p>Intel is investing $20 million &#8212; billion in a semiconductor campus in Ohio.&nbsp; I think &#8212; Mary, I think GM is investing about $7 billion in new plant and equipment.&nbsp; And, Ford, I think you&#8217;re doing $11 billion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The point is: These are &#8212; these are hi- &#8212; these are history-making investments to build electric vehicles here at home.</p>



<p>We’ve seen record electric vehicle sales, along with records in solar, wind, and battery storage as well.</p>



<p>In sector after sector, we’re making it in America again.&nbsp; And that’s what my overwhelming objective is: to make it in America.</p>



<p>With the Infrastructure Law, we’re going to keep &#8212; we&#8217;re going to keep building millions of good-paying jobs, and they&#8217;re real jobs.</p>



<p>And to build on progress, the Senate and House need to work on the Innovation Bill and send it to my desk.&nbsp; It’s important for our economy and, I would argue, for our national security as well.</p>



<p>And we’re also leading on the global stage because of you all.&nbsp; I’m pleased to see American companies stepping up and doing their part.&nbsp; And what you&#8217;re doing in terms of donating to Ukraine and winding down your operations without anybody requesting it.&nbsp; I want to make that clear: You&#8217;re on your own on winding down operations in Russia.&nbsp; Not all, but many have.&nbsp; Not only you, but around the world.</p>



<p>And for the first time &#8212; on that subject, let me say this &#8212; for the first time that Putin began amassing troops along the Ukrainian border, I called for an emergency meeting of NATO in Europe to make the case that we had to be united.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The one thing I&#8217;m confident, knowing Putin fairly well &#8212; as well as, I guess, another leader could know one another &#8212; is that he was counting on being able to split NATO.&nbsp; He never thought NATO would stay resolved &#8212; stay totally, thoroughly united. &nbsp;</p>



<p>And I can assure you: NATO has never been stronger or more united in its entire history than it is today, in large part because of Vladimir Putin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And &#8212; but, you know, in response to his aggression, there has been &#8212; we presented a united front throughout NATO and in the Pacific.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Quad is &#8212; with the possible exception of India being somewhat shaky on some of this.&nbsp; But Japan has been extremely strong, so has Australia, in terms of dealing with Putin&#8217;s aggression.&nbsp; We presented a united front throughout NATO and the Pacific.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And you did a hell of a lot to help us impose sanctions and incur costs &#8212; real costs on the Russian economy.&nbsp; And we’re seeing now that it mattered.&nbsp; It was really important what you all did.&nbsp; Not every one of you, but &#8212; I&#8217;m not suggesting you all had to &#8212; but those of you who did step up, it made a big &#8212; made a big difference.&nbsp; And I’m personally, as President, grateful for that.</p>



<p>But because our response &#8212; because our response is working, because the Ukrainians are fighting so valiantly and using the equipment we’ve given them &#8212; and the United States alone has committed over $2 billion to NATO.&nbsp; The idea that they don’t have enough sophisticated equipment is just simply not accurate.&nbsp; And I&#8217;m not going to take the time to go into all of the detail here, but the point is: They have every &#8212; every equipment &#8212; every piece of equipment that makes rational sense, based on our military and NATO&#8217;s military, for them to be able to do what they&#8217;re doing.&nbsp; And they&#8217;re wreaking havoc on the &#8212; on the Russian military, whether it&#8217;s their tanks or their helicopters or their aircraft.</p>



<p>And, if you notice, they&#8217;ve just launched a &#8212; their hypersonic missile, because it&#8217;s the only thing that they can get through with absolute certainty.&nbsp; It&#8217;s &#8212; as you all know, it&#8217;s a consequential weapon.&nbsp; And &#8212; but &#8212; with the same warhead on it as a &#8212; as any other launched missile.&nbsp; It doesn’t make that much difference, except it&#8217;s almost impossible to stop it.&nbsp; There&#8217;s a reason they&#8217;re using it.</p>



<p>And now Putin’s back is against the wall.&nbsp; He wasn’t anticipating the extent or the strength of our unity.&nbsp; And the more his back is against the wall, the greater the severity of the tactics he may employ.</p>



<p>We’ve seen it before.&nbsp; He&#8217;s run a lot of false-flag operations.&nbsp; Whenever he starts talking about something he thinks NATO, Ukraine, or the United States is about to do, it means he&#8217;s getting ready to do it.&nbsp; Not a joke.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You may recall &#8212; I said this to a few of you this morning that I was able to declassify a whole range of operations that they were about to engage in without sacrificing sources and methods.&nbsp; And it was able to give everybody clear notice what was about to come.&nbsp; And it convinced a lot of our friends around the world that we know what they&#8217;re about to do.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so, his back is against the wall.&nbsp; And he&#8217;s &#8212; now he&#8217;s talking about new false flags he&#8217;s setting up, including he&#8217;s asserting that, we, in America, have biological as well as chemical weapons in Europe &#8212; simply not true.&nbsp; I guarantee you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They&#8217;re also suggesting that Ukraine has biological and chemical weapons in Ukraine.&nbsp; That’s a clear sign he is considering using both of those.&nbsp; He&#8217;s already used chemical weapons in the past, and we should be careful of what about &#8212; of what&#8217;s about to come.&nbsp; He knows there&#8217;ll be severe consequences because of the united NATO front, but the point is: It&#8217;s real.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And what I want to mention very much &#8212; very quickly with you all is: One of the tools he’s most likely to use, in my view, in our view, is cyber &#8212; cyberattacks.&nbsp; They have a very sophisticated cyber capability.</p>



<p>I’ve had, as they say in southern Delaware, where they &#8212; where they are very religious: We&#8217;ve had an &#8220;altar call,&#8221; he and I, on this issue.&nbsp; We’ve had a long conversation about, if he uses it, what would be the consequence.</p>



<p>But the point is that he has a capability; he hasn&#8217;t used it yet.&nbsp; And &#8212; but it’s part of his playbook.&nbsp; And I&#8217;ve warned about the potential for Russian conduct to maliciously &#8212; malicious cyber activity in response to the cost we’d impose, with our Allies and partners, on the world.</p>



<p>But, look, today my administration has issued renewed warnings that, based on evolving intelligence, Russia may be planning a cyberattack against us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And as I&#8217;ve said, the magnitude of Russia&#8217;s cyber capacity is fairly consequential, and it&#8217;s coming.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The federal government is doing its part to get ready.&nbsp; But under U.S. law, as you all remember, the private sector, all of you, largely decides the protections that we will or will not take in order to protect your sources.</p>



<p>But let me be absolutely clear about something: It&#8217;s not just in your interests that are at stake with their potential use of cybersecurity, it is in &#8212; the national interest is at stake.</p>



<p>&nbsp; And I would respectfully suggest it&#8217;s a patriotic obligation for you to invest as much as you can in making sure &#8212; and we will urge &#8212; we&#8217;ll help in any way that you have built up your technological capacity to deal with cyber capa- &#8212; with cyberattacks: first, to protect your own companies; second, that provides critical &#8212; as providers of critical services that Americans rely on, from power to clean water; and finally, your role you can play in helping secure every American and every American’s privacy.</p>



<p>For example, banks can turn on cybersecurity by default for every customer so America&#8217;s financial data is safe.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re prepared to help you, as I said, with any tools and expertise we possess if you&#8217;re ready to do that.&nbsp; But it&#8217;s your decision as to the steps you&#8217;ll take and your responsibility to take them, not ours.</p>



<p>Now we need to do what&#8217;s necessary to support Ukraine, but we also need to step up for the families here at home.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2019, your organizations realized &#8212; or, excuse me, released a statement with a signature of almost everyone in this room.&nbsp; And it says, quote, “America deserves an economy that allows each person to succeed through hard work and creativity, and to lead a life of meaning and dignity.”&nbsp; And it expressed a commitment from you to invest in your workforce and support local communities.&nbsp; It wasn&#8217;t a do-gooder statement; it was a capitalist statement.&nbsp; We’re all capitalists in this room.&nbsp;&nbsp;And you did the right thing, in my view, in the assertion of that statement.</p>



<p>This was your view about how to run strong, profitable companies over the long term.&nbsp; And this commitment of consequence and pear- &#8212; for &#8212; prepare for the free world is vital that you reaffirm that commitment, in my humble opinion.</p>



<p>We can’t afford to prioritize shareholders at the expense of your stakeholders, the environment, your workers, your customers, your communities where they live and work.&nbsp; And you&#8217;re not doing that, but I think the inclination &#8212; would be inclined to do that on some occasions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Instead, now&#8217;s the time to invest in your people.&nbsp; You can hire and retain the best workforce &#8212; best-trained workforce in the entire world, which you&#8217;ve been doing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To invest in innovation so you can &#8212; we can deliver better and more affordable products and services from &#8212; to more Americans.</p>



<p>To innovate with and for diversity, as you said in your statement, as you &#8212; as you committed to earlier this year.</p>



<p>Cultivating tools of artificial intelligence and advanced [to advance] dignity and opportunity for all Americans is what you’ve been doing, many of you, and it really matters.</p>



<p>And to invest in America itself in manufacturing; created over 450,000 manufacturing jobs because of you all, and it really matters.&nbsp; It hadn’t happened in a long time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As one of my colleagues from the Midwest said: We&#8217;re not going to talk about the Rust Belt anymore; we&#8217;re going to talk about new, expanded manufacturing capacity in the Middle &#8212; in the Middle Atlantics &#8212; excuse me, in the Midwest.</p>



<p>And to invest in America itself &#8212; in manufacturing, climate resilience, clean energy &#8212; so America can win the competition in the 21st century.</p>



<p>And it won&#8217;t hurt your bottom lines or the economy.&nbsp; It helps continue us &#8212; it’ll help us grow while lowering costs and lowering the deficit.</p>



<p>So, I want to thank you again for &#8212; there’s much more to say, but I&#8217;ve already probably taken too much time &#8212; of your time right now.</p>



<p>But I&#8217;m happy &#8212; I&#8217;m told I&#8217;m &#8212; we’re going to take some questions, Mary.&nbsp; Is that right?&nbsp; Well, I&#8217;m happy to start taking questions.</p>



<p>But thank you for all you&#8217;ve been doing.</p>



<p>I think &#8212; you know, my mother had an expression: &#8220;Out of everything terrible, something good will come if you look hard enough for it.&#8221;</p>



<p>I think this presents us with some significant opportunities to make some real changes.&nbsp; You know, we are at an inflection point, I believe, in the world economy &#8212; not just the world economy, in the world.&nbsp; It occurs every three or four generations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As one of &#8212; as one of the top military people said to me in a secure meeting the other day, 60 &#8212; 60 million people died between 1900 and 1946.&nbsp; And since then, we’ve established a liberal world order, and that hadn’t happened in a long while.&nbsp; A lot of people dying, but nowhere near the chaos.</p>



<p>And now is a time when things are shifting.&nbsp; We’re going to &#8212; there’s going to be a new world order out there, and we’ve got to lead it.&nbsp; And we’ve got to unite the rest of the free world in doing it.</p>



<p>So, anyway, I’m going to hush up.&nbsp; Mary, fire away.</p>



<p>(The press departs.)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>2:45 P.M. EDT</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Hi, everyone.&nbsp; Okay, we have a very special return guest today, Deputy National Security Advisor Anne Neuberger, who is here to provide a brief update on cyber.&nbsp; You probably have seen the statement from the President we issued, as well as a factsheet; she’ll talk about that.&nbsp; Has a little bit of time to take some questions, and then we&#8217;ll do a briefing from there.</p>



<p>With that, I’ll turn it over to Anne.</p>



<p>MS. NEUBERGER:&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.&nbsp; Good afternoon, everyone.</p>



<p>This afternoon, the President released a statement and factsheet regarding cyber threats to the homeland, urging private sector partners to take immediate action to shore up their defenses against potential cyberattacks.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve previously warned about the potential for Russia to conduct cyberattacks against the United States, including as a response to the unprecedented economic costs that the U.S. and Allies and partners imposed in response to Russia&#8217;s further invasion of Ukraine.</p>



<p>Today, we are reiterating those warnings, and we&#8217;re doing so based on evolving threat intelligence that the Russian government is exploring options for potential cyberattacks on critical infrastructure in the United States.</p>



<p>To be clear, there is no certainty there will be a cyber incident on critical infrastructure.&nbsp; So why am I here?&nbsp; Because this is a call to action and a call to responsibility for all of us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the President&#8217;s direction, the administration has worked extensively over the last year to prepare to meet this sort of threat, providing unprecedented warning and advice to the private sector and mandating cybersecurity measures where we have the authority to do so.</p>



<p>For example, just last week, federal agencies convened more than 100 companies to share new cybersecurity threat information in light of this evolving threat intelligence.&nbsp; During those meetings, we shared resources and tools to help companies harden their security, like advisories sourced from sensitive threat intelligence and hands-on support from local FBI field offices and sister regional offices, including their Shields Up program.</p>



<p>The meeting was part of an extensive cybersecurity resilience effort that we began in the fall, prompted by the President.&nbsp; Agencies like Energy, EPA, Treasury, and DHS have hosted both classified and unclassified briefings with hundreds of owners and operators of privately owned critical infrastructure.&nbsp; CISA, NSA, and FBI have published cybersecurity advisories that set out protections the private sector can deploy to improve security.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The President has also directed departments and agencies to use all existing government authorities to mandate new cybersecurity and network defense measures.&nbsp; You&#8217;ve seen us do that where we have the authority to do so, including TSA’s work that mandated directives for the oil and gas pipelines following the Colonial Pipeline incident that highlighted the significant gaps in resilience for that sector.</p>



<p>Our efforts together over the past year has helped drive much-needed and significant improvements.&nbsp; But there&#8217;s so much more we need to do to have the confidence that we&#8217;ve locked our digital doors, particularly for the critical services Americans rely on.</p>



<p>The majority of our critical infrastructure, as you know, is owned and operated by the private sector.&nbsp; And those owners and operators have the ability and the responsibility to harden the systems and networks we all rely on.</p>



<p>Notwithstanding these repeated warnings, we continue to see adversaries compromising systems that use known vulnerabilities for which there are patches.&nbsp; This is deeply troubling.</p>



<p>So we&#8217;re urging, today, companies to take the steps within your control to act immediately to protect the services millions of Americans rely on and to use the resources the federal government makes available.&nbsp; The factsheet released alongside the President’s statement contains the specific actions that we&#8217;re calling companies to do.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I would be remiss if I didn&#8217;t reiterate the President&#8217;s thanks to Congress for its partnership in this effort, including making cybersecurity resources available in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and, most recently, for working across the aisle to require companies to report cyber incidents to the federal government.&nbsp; That will ensure federal resources are focused on the most important cyber threats to the American people.</p>



<p>We welcome additional congressional work to identify new authorities that can help address gaps and drive down collective cybersecurity risk.</p>



<p>Bottom line: This is about us &#8212; the work we need to do to lock our digital doors and to put the country in the best defensive position.</p>



<p>And there is them.&nbsp; As the President has said: The United States is not seeking confrontation with Russia.&nbsp; But he has also said that if Russia conducts disruptive cyberattacks against critical infrastructure, we will be prepared to respond.</p>



<p>Thank you.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; All right.&nbsp; Let me just first ask, for those of you in the aisles, if you&#8217;re not a photographer, there&#8217;s plenty of seats.&nbsp; So if you could sit down, that would be great, and not crowd the others in the seats.</p>



<p>So, we don&#8217;t have unlimited time, so if people &#8212; we just want to get to as many people as possible.</p>



<p>So, go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.&nbsp; Hi, Anne.&nbsp; Just a quick question on the Viasat attack that happened on the 24th of Feb, the day Russia attacked Ukraine.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve obviously seen that impact satellite communication networks in Eastern Europe.&nbsp; And since then, the FBI and CISA have issued warnings that similar attacks can happen against U.S. companies.</p>



<p>Is the U- &#8212; is the U.S. in a position to perhaps identify who is behind the hack at this moment?</p>



<p>MS. NEUBERGER:&nbsp; It&#8217;s a really good question.&nbsp; So, first, I want to lift up: FBI and CISA and NSA also highlighted protective security measures that U.S. companies can put in place to protect against exactly that kind of attack.&nbsp; We have not yet attributed that attack, but we&#8217;re carefully looking at it because, as you noted, of the impact not only in Ukraine but also in satellite communication systems in Europe as well.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does the sophistication of the attack, perhaps the timing of it, suggest that it&#8217;s a state actor?&nbsp; I mean, are you willing to &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. NEUBERGER:&nbsp; Those are certainly factors that are &#8212; we&#8217;re looking at carefully as we look at who is responsible for them.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Phil.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The “evolving intelligence,” it doesn&#8217;t mean that it’s a certainty there&#8217;s going to be an attack.&nbsp; Can you explain for the layman what you&#8217;re seeing right now that precipitated this statement today, and what the evolving intelligence may be now compared to on the 24th or prior to the invasion?</p>



<p>MS. NEUBERGER:&nbsp; Absolutely.&nbsp; So, the first part of that is: You&#8217;ve seen the administration continuously lean forward and share even fragmentary pieces of information we have to drive and ensure maximum preparedness by the private sector.</p>



<p>So as soon as we learned about that, last week we hosted classified briefings with companies and sectors who we felt would be most affected, and provided very practical, focused advice.</p>



<p>Today&#8217;s broader, unclassified briefing is to raise that broader awareness and to raise that call to action.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So there was something specific you saw last week that was raised to the industries that it would have affected, is what you’re saying?</p>



<p>MS. NEUBERGER:&nbsp; So I want to reiterate: There is no evidence of any &#8212; of any specific cyberattack that we&#8217;re anticipating for.&nbsp; There is some preparatory activity that we&#8217;re seeing, and that is what we shared in a classified context with companies who we thought might be affected.&nbsp; And then we&#8217;re lifting up a broader awareness here in this &#8212; in this warning.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Major?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey, Anne.&nbsp; When you say a “call to action,” many who hear you say that might believe that something is imminent.&nbsp; Is it?</p>



<p>MS. NEUBERGER:&nbsp; So, first, a “call to action” is because there are cyberattacks that occur every day.&nbsp; Hundreds of millions of dollars were paid in ransoms by U.S. companies just last year against criminal activity happening in the U.S. today. Every single day, there should be a call to action.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re using the opportunity of this evolving threat intelligence regarding potential cyberattacks against critical infrastructure to reiterate those with additional focus specifically to critical infrastructure owners and operators to say, “You have the responsibility to take these steps to protect the critical services Americans rely on.”</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And as a follow-up: “Critical infrastructure” is a broad term.&nbsp; Is it as broad as you typically mean it when the government speaks about critical infrastructure, or is there something you&#8217;ve seen that you can be more &#8212; a little bit more specific within that large frame of critical infrastructure?</p>



<p>MS. NEUBERGER:&nbsp; I won&#8217;t get into specific sectors at this time, because the steps that are needed to lock our digital doors need to be done across every sector of critical infrastructure.&nbsp; And even those sectors that we do not see any specific threat intelligence for, we truly want those sectors to double down and do the work that&#8217;s needed.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Jacqui.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You guys, the administration, successfully declassified a lot of intelligence about what the Russians were planning leading up to the invasion to prebut what they might do.&nbsp; Can you do that a little bit here and at least list some of the industries that might be the biggest targets so that they can have a heightened awareness about what might be coming?</p>



<p>MS. NEUBERGER:&nbsp; As we consider declassifying intelligence, to your excellent point, that really has been the work that has been done the last few weeks and was driven by a focus on outcomes.&nbsp; It was driven by the President&#8217;s desire to avoid war at all costs, to really invest in diplomacy.</p>



<p>So, as we consider this information, the first step we did was we gave classified, detailed briefings to the companies and sectors for which we had some preparatory information about.&nbsp; And then for those where we don&#8217;t, that&#8217;s the purpose of today&#8217;s unclassified briefing: to give that broad warning.&nbsp; And I want to lift up the factsheet, which is really the call to action for specific activities to do.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So you believe the people, the industries that need to know about this risk know?</p>



<p>MS. NEUBERGER:&nbsp; We believe the key entities who need to know have been provided classified briefings.&nbsp; I mentioned, for example, just last week, several hundred companies were brought in to get that briefing.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:  Peter.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does the U.S. have any evidence that Russia has attempted a hack, either here in the U.S., in Europe, or in Ukraine, over the course of the last several weeks since this offensive began?</p>



<p>MS. NEUBERGER:&nbsp; So, we certainly believe that Russia has conducted cyberattacks to undermine, coerce, and destabilize Ukraine.&nbsp; And we attributed some of those a couple of weeks ago.</p>



<p>We consistently see nation states doing preparatory activity.&nbsp; That preparatory activity can pan out to become an incident; it cannot.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s the reason we’re here.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, specifically in the U.S., as there was an assessment early on that we thought that we would be a likely target here, why do you think we have not seen any attack on critical infrastructure in the United States to this point so far?</p>



<p>MS. NEUBERGER:&nbsp; I can&#8217;t speak to Putin or Russian leadership’s strategic thinking regarding how cyberattacks factor in.</p>



<p>What I can speak to is the preparatory work we&#8217;ve been doing here in the U.S. and the fact that as soon as we have some evolving threat intelligence regarding a shift in that intention, that were coming out and raising the awareness to heighten our preparedness as well.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So you can’t say declaratively that we stopped an attack, I guess I&#8217;m saying, to this point on critical infrastructure?</p>



<p>MS. NEUBERGER:&nbsp; Correct.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Colleen.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you explain a little bit more what preparatory activity on the part of the Russians would be?&nbsp; What does that look like?</p>



<p>MS. NEUBERGER:&nbsp; So, preparatory activity could mean scanning websites; it could be hunting for vulnerabilities. There&#8217;s a range of activity that malicious cyber actors use, whether they’re nation state or criminals.</p>



<p>The most troubling piece and really one I mentioned a moment ago is we continue to see known vulnerabilities, for which we have patches available, used by even sophisticated cyber actors to compromise American companies, to compromise companies around the world.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s one of the reasons &#8212; and that makes it far easier for attackers than it needs to be.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s kind of &#8212; you know, I joke &#8212; I grew up in New York &#8212; you had a lock and an alarm system.&nbsp; The houses that didn&#8217;t or left the door open clearly were making it easier than they should have.&nbsp; Right?&nbsp; No comment about New York.&nbsp; (Laughter.)</p>



<p>So, clearly what we’re asking for is: Lock your digital doors.&nbsp; Make it harder for attackers.&nbsp; Make them do more work.&nbsp; Because a number of the practices we include in the factsheet will make it significantly harder, even for a sophisticated actor, to compromise a network.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sorry, just to be clear: The warning today, is this in response to some of these more desperate tactics we’ve seen from Russia on ground?&nbsp; Are you now fearing that there might be more of a cyber risk because of what we’re seeing on the ground in Ukraine?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. NEUBERGER:&nbsp; So, we’ve given a number of threat intel- &#8212; of threat warnings over the last number of weeks that Russia could consider conducting cyberattacks in response to the very significant economic costs the U.S. and partners have put on Russia in response.&nbsp; This speaks to evolving threat intelligence and a potential shift in intention to do so.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And do you have a message for individuals?&nbsp; You’re talking a lot about private companies.&nbsp; What about households?&nbsp; Should they be worried about cyberattacks here?</p>



<p>MS. NEUBERGER:&nbsp; The items in the factsheet apply to companies and individuals as well.&nbsp; I&#8217;m specifically speaking to companies because there&#8217;s a responsibility to protect the critical services Americans rely on.&nbsp; But every individual should take a look at that fact sheet because it&#8217;s a truly helpful one.&nbsp; We only put in place the things that we really try to practice and work to practice ourselves.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;Jordan.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; As part of this preparatory activity, do you have evidence that Russian hackers have infiltrated the networks of U.S. companies already and just haven’t carried out the attacks?</p>



<p>MS. NEUBERGER:&nbsp; There was &#8212; as I noted, we frequently see preparatory activity.&nbsp; Whenever we do, we do sensitive warnings to the individual companies and provide them information to ensure they can look quickly at their networks and remediate what may be occurring.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So have you seen any evidence that there have been infiltrations as part of that activity?</p>



<p>MS. NEUBERGER:&nbsp; We routinely see information about infiltrations.&nbsp; Right?&nbsp; Technology is not as secure as it needs to be.&nbsp; I mentioned the ransomware activity.&nbsp; There are multiple nation-state actors.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a line of work for the intelligence community and the FBI to knock on a company&#8217;s door and say, “We&#8217;ve seen some evidence of an intrusion.&nbsp; We&#8217;ll work with you.&nbsp; We&#8217;ll make these resources available via a regional office to work with you to help you recover.”&nbsp; That&#8217;s &#8212; that&#8217;s pretty routine practice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What we&#8217;re seeing now is an evolving threat intelligence to conduct potential cyberattacks on critical infrastructure.&nbsp; And that raises up a point because we&#8217;re concerned about potential disruption of critical services.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Ken.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anne, you did a briefing for us about a month ago.&nbsp; Do you think the U.S. banking system is more vulnerable, less vulnerable since the briefing, given the warnings that the government has produced?</p>



<p>MS. NEUBERGER:&nbsp; The U.S. banking sector truly takes cyber threats seriously, both individually and as a group.&nbsp; Treasury has worked extensively with the sector to share sensitive threat intelligence at the executive level, at the security executive level, repeatedly at the classified and unclassified level.&nbsp; So, I do not believe they&#8217;re more at risk, but it is always important for every critical infrastructure sector to double down in this heightened period of geopolitical tension to carefully look at any threat.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you paint a worst-case scenario picture for us?&nbsp; What exactly are you most worried about if people &#8212; the private sector chooses to not take these steps?</p>



<p>MS. NEUBERGER:&nbsp; Clearly, what we&#8217;re always &#8212; I won&#8217;t get into hypotheticals, right?&nbsp; But the reason I&#8217;m here is because critical infrastructure &#8212; power, water, many hospitals &#8212; in the United States are owned by the private sector.&nbsp; And while the federal government makes extensive resources available &#8212; I mentioned FBI’s 56 regional offices &#8212; you can just walk in; CISA has offices near most FEMA sites in the United States.&nbsp; They’ve had their Shields Up program.&nbsp; We can make those resources available. &nbsp;For those sectors where we can mandate measures like oil and gas pipelines, we have. &nbsp;But it&#8217;s ultimately the private sector’s responsibility, in our current authority structure, to do those steps, to use those resources to take those steps.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, the purpose here is to say: Americans rely on those critical services.&nbsp; Please act. &nbsp;And we&#8217;re here to support with the resources we have.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Kayla, last one.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Anne, are you still seeing the Russians carrying out cyberattacks inside Ukraine?&nbsp; It&#8217;s been a few weeks since we&#8217;ve been discussing that in particular.</p>



<p>And as financial tools levied by the West have proven ineffective, what cyber tools does the West have that it can possibly utilize?</p>



<p>MS. NEUBERGER:&nbsp; We do continue to see Russia conducting both &#8212; as you know, right? &#8212; significant malicious activity in Ukraine; major kinetic attacks, which have disrupted and killed lives; as well as cyber activity.&nbsp; And we believe the unprecedented economic costs the United States and partners have levied is significant in that way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With regard to your question about whether cyberattacks would change that: I think the President was very clear we&#8217;re not looking for a conflict with Russia.&nbsp; If Russia initiates a cyberattack against the United States, we will respond.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Thank you, Anne, so much for joining us.</p>



<p>MS. NEUBERGER:&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Thank you for having me.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Anne.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Anne.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; All right.&nbsp; I just had two brief items for all of you at the top.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There was a scheduled meeting today that Secretary Yellen, Secretary Raimondo, Jake Sullivan, and Brian Deese had with 16 CEOs this afternoon.&nbsp; The President also dropped by for about 20 minutes and provided them an update on Russia, Ukraine.&nbsp; I&#8217;m sure we can get you a list of the attendees at that meeting as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Also wanted to note &#8212; a number of you have asked about whether the President would be watching the hearings today.&nbsp; One scheduling note is the Quint meet- &#8212; call he had this morning was at exactly the same time as her opening statement, but he did request regular updates &#8212; or has been requesting regular updates from members of the team on how the hearing is going.</p>



<p>And he also called her last night to wish her good luck this week at the hearings.</p>



<p>And I would also note that he&#8217;s very grateful to Judge Tom Grif- &#8212; Thomas Griffith, as well as Lisa Fairfax, for introducing her today.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So with that, I will stop.&nbsp; And, Colleen, why don&#8217;t you kick us off.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; So, do you &#8212; can give us a readout of the call with the European leaders from earlier?&nbsp; Just sort of what was discussed, what happened.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And then I have one other question after that.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Absolutely.&nbsp; If you haven&#8217;t already &#8212; there should be a readout going out shortly, but let me give you a few of the preview points of this call:&nbsp;</p>



<p>During this call with President Macron of France, Chancellor Scholz of Germany, Prime Minister Draghi of Italy, and Prime Minister Boris Johnson of the United Kingdom, they discussed their serious concerns about Russia&#8217;s brutal tactics in Ukraine, including its attacks on civilians.&nbsp; They underscored their continued support for Ukraine, including by providing security assistance to the brave Ukrainians who are defending their country from Russian aggression and humanitarian assistance to the millions of Ukrainians who have fled the violence.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They also reviewed recent diplomatic efforts in support of Ukraine&#8217;s effort to reach a ceasefire.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I would note: The President will obviously see these leaders &#8212; a number of them &#8212; in person later this week.&nbsp; And this is a call with this group that he has already had a few times.&nbsp; And when he had the last call with them &#8212; I believe it was last week or the week before; it may have been last week &#8212; they talked about doing this on a regular basis, not necessarily because there is a big deliverable out of it but just to keep an open line of communication as they’re conti- &#8212; all continuing to respond to the brutal actions of President Putin in Ukraine.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, on the potential discussions with Ukrainian leaders and Russia, has the White House or has the President been in communication with Ukrainian leaders, with Zelenskyy on this?&nbsp; Has he given any sort of counseling on how to go about these talks with Russian leaders in the hope of, you know, ending the conflict?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We are in touch with the Ukrainian government &#8212; senior government officials every day.&nbsp; The President obviously speaks with &#8212; has spoken with President Zelenskyy a number of times, as you all know.&nbsp; And we convey, through all of those discussions, that we support any diplomatic effort that they choose to take part in.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The role that we feel we can play most effectively is by continuing to provide a broad range of security assistance, military assistance to them as well as economic and humanitarian assistance to strengthen their hand in these negotiations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And what we always convey publicly and privately is that we&#8217;re going to be watching closely their actions, not just what words they say.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But we just continue to support their efforts and whatever decisions they make about choosing to engage diplomatically.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; President Zelenskyy said if those talks don&#8217;t work out, it&#8217;s World War Three.&nbsp; Does the President agree?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Without knowing more of what President Zelenskyy means by that, I would say that our view and the President&#8217;s view is that the way we need to avoid World War Three is preventing the United States from having direct military involvement on the ground and same on NATO, direct involvement on the ground, and that the most effective role we can continue to play is by providing that extensive military assistance that we have been providing &#8212; economic and humanitarian assistance.&nbsp; So, I can’t assess.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Obviously, I know many of you will speak or hear more from President Zelenskyy soon, and I would expect he can speak more to what he meant by that.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And related to that, does the President believe that President Zelenskyy owes him or other NATO leaders a check-in as these negotiations progress and as he may approach a final resolution?&nbsp; Meaning, does NATO or does the President want either implied or soft veto power over whatever Zelenskyy might decide to do?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, we support President Zelenskyy and Ukrainian leaders’ decisions &#8212; ability to make their own decisions through the course of these negotiations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, obviously, if it involves something related to the United States or NATO, we&#8217;re here to support.&nbsp; But, of course, we&#8217;d need to be engaged in that aspect of the discussion.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One last thing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On “Face the Nation,” the Chinese ambassador said China&#8217;s position is for peace and that it&#8217;s constantly doing everything it can to de-escalate.&nbsp; Do you agree with that?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, what I would note &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you say it’s a fair characterization of what China is doing?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, what I would note: Also in the same interview, he failed to condemn the actions of &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He said it wouldn’t do any good.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; &#8212; President Putin.</p>



<p>I’m sorry?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He said it wouldn’t make any difference.&nbsp; Do you agree with that?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I think our view is that verbal condemnation of the actions of President Putin and the actions of Russian military is important and vital, and it&#8217;s about what side of history you want to stand on at this point in time.</p>



<p>At the same time, as you know, the President had a lengthy discussion with President Xi on Friday, and we&#8217;re going to continue to keep those lines of communication open.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But what we would note here is also what is absent from a lot of their public commentary, which is condemnation at times; sometimes it has been echoing of conspiracy theories that the Russians have put out there about chemical weapons.&nbsp; And we note that, you know, what we want to hear is condemnation of what we&#8217;re seeing on the ground.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you walk us through the President&#8217;s trip a little bit later this week?&nbsp; We know he&#8217;s going to stop in Brussels first, obviously.&nbsp; Then he goes to Poland, as you announced this weekend.&nbsp; Will he see refugees?&nbsp; Will he deliver a speech?&nbsp; Are there deliverables?&nbsp; Can you walk us through what you can tell us?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; There will certainly be deliverables, as there always are on these trips.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah, there are.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; And &#8212; there always are.&nbsp; We&#8217;re still finalizing, believe it or not, the details of the trip and the specifics of what he&#8217;ll be doing while he&#8217;s in Poland.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He, of course, will be seeing his counterpart there.&nbsp; And he will certainly thank him for the efforts and the work that Poland has done and the leaders have done there to welcome refugees, to get them settled in Poland for this time being as devastating as the circumstances are.</p>



<p>Jake Sullivan is going to be joining us here tomorrow.&nbsp; And hopefully by then we will have more specifics to lay out for all of you, but we&#8217;re finalizing the details as we speak.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me ask you about their assessments we&#8217;re hearing from NATO right now that are &#8212; some are saying that if we&#8217;re not in a stalemate, we are rapidly approaching one.&nbsp; Does the U.S. have a position on that that appears to be the way this is heading and how that changes the sort of trajectory of this, and what your view is &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; You mean in terms of the military situation on the ground?</p>



<p>Q    In Ukraine.  Correct.<br><br>     MS. PSAKI:  Well, here’s what we’ve seen on the ground: We’re seeing that &#8212; the Department of Defense has assessed &#8212; and I know they&#8217;ve done briefings in this regard, so let me echo this &#8212; that there certainly could be some morale issues of troops on the ground, that they are in a stalemate in the sense that they have not been making the &#8212; the level of progress or the pace of progress that they had hoped from the beginning. <br><br>     Now, obviously, things can change rapidly in conflicts, and so we are mindful of that as well.  We&#8217;re also seeing, obviously, over the course of the last couple of days, that fighting around Mariupol is fierce but remains, at this point, isolated.  It remains a high priority for Russia because it would provide President Putin with a land bridge to Crimea and cut off Ukrainian forces there from the rest of the country, provide the Russians with a new port. <br><br>     But the military situation elsewhere in Ukraine, according to our assessment, remains largely static.  It doesn&#8217;t mean that can&#8217;t change; it&#8217;s just an assessment as of this moment.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last quick one, as it relates to Belarus: Right now, some in NATO are saying that Russia is preparing to potentially &#8212; or that Belarus is potentially preparing to let Russia position nuclear weapons on Belarusian soil.&nbsp; Does the U.S. have a message to the government of Belarus?&nbsp; And how would you view that escalation?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, we don&#8217;t have any confirmation of those reports or suggestions.&nbsp; Certainly, that would be of concern to us, yes.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go ahead, Jacqui.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.</p>



<p>In the past, you’ve said that domestic oil producers have the leases, resources that they need to ramp up production.&nbsp; Is there any thought about invoking the Defense Production Act when it comes to energy?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, there are a range of ideas out there &#8212; that&#8217;s one of them &#8212; that a number of people have put forward.&nbsp; I would say that the Defense Production Act is &#8212; would mean giving government funding to companies or to purchase products.&nbsp; That&#8217;s how it typically works, as you&#8217;ve seen it work with COVID supplies and otherwise.&nbsp; And we think they have the resources they need in order to expand their production.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, on government money and supplies: There are reports that the EU is seeking to stockpile iodine pills and nuclear protective gear amid an increased concern about a nuclear threat, and also looking for more ways to deal with potential biological and chemical attacks.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the U.S. taking similar measures when it comes to these things, especially with iodine pills?&nbsp; Are we taking, sort of, the lessons learned in the pandemic and applying it to this challenge?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure, Jacqui, it’s a good question.&nbsp; Let me check with our national security team and see if there&#8217;s any details I can get into.&nbsp; We are always prepared, even as we aren&#8217;t making predictions at this point in time.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have confirmation of that report about the Europeans, but I will &#8212; I will check and see if there&#8217;s more to report out to all of you.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, there are reports that China has fully militarized at least three islands in the disputed South China Sea with anti-ship, anti-aircraft missile systems; laser and jamming equipment; and fighter jets, despite Beijing&#8217;s promises not to turn these islands into military bases.&nbsp; What is our takeaway from that?&nbsp; And how are we responding to that?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, Jacqui, again, I don&#8217;t have confirmation of that from here.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve certainly seen the reports.&nbsp; I would point you to the Department of Defense for any more specific analysis.&nbsp; But, obviously, any escalatory actions in the South China Sea would be of concern to us.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then one more on the White House assessment of global food insecurity &#8212;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; that’s sort of coming out of all this in Ukraine.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there any &#8212; is there any money that&#8217;s going to be allocated to provide diesel fuel to Ukrainian farmers to try to mitigate some of this?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah, so, let me &#8212; so, let me give you a couple of things on this, because there&#8217;s been a lot of interesting reporting on this, and where the impacts are is a good question.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While we&#8217;re not expecting a food shortage here at home, we do anticipate that higher energy, fertilizer, wheat, and corn prices could impact the price of growing and purchasing critical fuol [sic] supply &#8212; food supplies for countries around the world.&nbsp; And early estimates from the World Bank suggest disproportionate impacts on low- and middle-income countries including in Africa, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And actually &#8212; and Ukraine is a big exporter of fertilizer.&nbsp; So as it relates to even that need in the United States and other parts of the world, that&#8217;s something that we&#8217;re continuing to closely assess as well.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But right now, to go back to the root of your question, we are working with our partners in the G7, multilateral development banks, the World Food Programme, and the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization to mitigate the impacts to poorer nations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So we are discussing what that looks like and how to mitigate the shortage on those &#8212; on those growing and purchasing entities from impacting parts of the world that would be severely impacted, even if we&#8217;re not.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What kind of a timeline do we think we have to take some action on that before it becomes a really big problem?<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, there &#8212; there are active discussions now.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re certainly mindful that even if we&#8217;re not seeing an impact in this moment that sometimes supply chain impacts can have a lagging &#8212; can be a &#8212; have a lagging impact.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So we&#8217;re having discussions now with all of those partners.&nbsp; Those have been ongoing so we can do everything we can to mitigate it in advance.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And can I ask one question &#8212; just a reaction to the Israeli Prime Minister.&nbsp; This weekend, he said, on the JCPOA, “Unfortunately, [we&#8217;re seeing a] determination to sign a nuclear deal…at almost any cost, including saying the [biggest] terrorist [group] in the world is not a terrorist organization.&nbsp; This is too [steep] a price.”&nbsp; Can I get your reaction to that?&nbsp; Is that what we&#8217;re saying by pursuing this deal?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I would say we are in regular touch with our Israeli counterparts, including leaders.&nbsp; We don&#8217;t have a deal yet.&nbsp; We&#8217;re consulting with our allies and partners, including Israel, as we negotiate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And the President is going to make a decision on whether to reenter the deal based on what&#8217;s in the best interest of American security and strategic interests, including the security of our partners in regions like Israel.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And once &#8212; if and when we have a deal, I&#8217;m sure we can discuss more specifics.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; We’ve now had a chance to hear from some of the Judiciary Committee members in this confirmation for Judge Jackson.&nbsp; Any thoughts on whether she will receive bipartisan support in her confirmation?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, without being able to get into the minds of a range of Republican members, our view is that given she has been confirmed three times with bipartisan support, that she has extensive experience, that she has ruled in favor of Democrats and Republicans under leaders of both parties, that she certainly deserves that.&nbsp; But we will see what the outcome ends up being.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And has the White House had any contact with Justice Thomas, given his hospitalization?&nbsp; Do you have any updates there?<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I&#8217;m not aware of any direct contacts.&nbsp; Of course, we wish him a speedy recovery.&nbsp; And of course, thoughts &#8212; thoughts out to his family.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And just a quick follow-up on the NATO trip.&nbsp; Can you give us just the big picture of what would a successful NATO summit look like to the White House?&nbsp; What are we looking for to measure that?<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; I mean, I think what&#8217;s important to remember here from the beginning of the Presi- &#8212; of the President&#8217;s presidency but also, certainly, over the last couple of months is that unity has been front and center for the President in terms of how &#8212; what will make us successful over time &#8212; unity with our European counterparts, unity among NATO, unity among the G7.&nbsp; And that doesn&#8217;t happen by accident.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so, coming out of this, what the President is hoping to achieve is continued coordination and a unified response to the continued escalatory actions of President Putin.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. was asked about this this weekend, but given the Poles appear to be planning to put upon the table some type of peacekeeping force idea, is there any feasible structure that the White House could support for something like that?&nbsp; Or have you guys looked into the idea at all?<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, we, of course, will continue to work with Poland and other allies and partners in Europe to provide support for the Ukrainian people and help them defend their country against Russian aggression and provide relief to the people of Ukraine.&nbsp; And we will continue to impose severe consequences.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The President &#8212; we&#8217;ve been &#8212; he’s been clear: We&#8217;re not going to send American troops to fight Russian troops.&nbsp; It’s not in the interest of the American people or our national security.&nbsp; But we&#8217;ll continue to discuss a range of ideas, including this one out there.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, there&#8217;s been, kind of, a reinvigoration in the EU of discussions about banning &#8212; or sanctions on energy.&nbsp; Can you update us on what the efforts in the administration has been to kind of backfill, which would, I think, be a necessity if those actions were taken?&nbsp; Where do those stand at this point?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; In terms of engagements with global energy suppliers?&nbsp; Those engage- &#8212; engagements are ongoing.&nbsp; And, you know, they are &#8212; they are led, in part, by Amos Hochstein, Brett McGurk has been involved in many of them, other members of our national security team and National Economic Council.&nbsp; And we are continuing to discuss with a range of large global suppliers how we can meet the demand in the market out there.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We also are continuing to look at domestic options and what those may look like to help ease the burden on the American public.&nbsp; I wish I had more specifics for you, but I don&#8217;t have anything more to read out for you at this point in time.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go ahead.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.&nbsp; The meeting you mentioned that President Biden participated in with CEOs earlier today, there were oil industry CEOs at that meeting.&nbsp; And considering the White House has been engaging with them for several weeks now &#8212; sort of, you know, talking about ways to increase production to take care of gas prices &#8212; I’m wondering what kind of specific assurances the White House has managed to get from these companies so far, and what was really discussed in today&#8217;s meeting, especially with the oil industry CEOs.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, while the President was there, he was simply giving them an update on Russia and Ukraine.&nbsp; He was not making an ask at that &#8212; in that capacity.&nbsp; Obviously, there are a range of senior officials who participated in these meetings.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve had a range of engagements with them, as you&#8217;ve noted.&nbsp; And we&#8217;ve stated publicly that they should do greater production, but they can speak for themselves on what, if anything, they would commit to.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have there been any assurances that the industry has perhaps offered the White House so far?<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We’ll let the oil industry speak for themselves.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; And one quick question on China.&nbsp; Are you getting any indications yet that China will actually heed to President Biden&#8217;s appeal to President Xi to not provide material support to Russia?&nbsp; Or are you seeing, perhaps, evidence suggesting that Chinese companies are maybe violating or going around U.S. export controls to, you know, send the material &#8212; the U.S. material to Russia?&nbsp; I mean, do you &#8212; are you seeing any evidence to that effect?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have an assessment to share on this.&nbsp; You can look at the public comments that one of your colleagues brought up earlier, during an interview yesterday, where the Chinese ambassador highlighted China&#8217;s friendly relations and maintenance of normal economic ties with Russia while also refusing to condemn Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine.&nbsp; But I don&#8217;t have a further assessment beyond that.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; The Russian Foreign Ministry summoned Ambassador Sullivan to the Ministry in Moscow and warned that U.S.-Russian relations are on the verge of rupture, said the President&#8217;s comments calling Putin a war criminal were unworthy of a statesman of such high rank.&nbsp; Does the White House have any response to this?&nbsp; And is there any concern about the warning that they&#8217;re going to respond with a &#8220;decisive and firm response&#8221;?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I&#8217;m not sure &#8212; the last part &#8212; I&#8217;m not sure what you mean by that.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They warned of a &#8220;decisive and firm response.&#8221;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Well, I would say that Ambassador Sullivan did meet with Russian government officials today; I believe the State Department also confirmed.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While we don&#8217;t provide extensive details in general of these type of diplomatic conversations, I can confirm for you that during that meeting, he repeatedly asked for consular access to American citizen detainees, which &#8212; who have been improperly detained ac- &#8212; been improperly denied access for months in some cases.&nbsp; We find this completely unacceptable.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As it relates to their comments or their calling of him in, I think it’s important to remind everyone that it is Russia who is carrying out an unprovoked, unjustified war on Ukraine.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We’re seeing clear evidence that they are intentionally targeting civilians and committing indiscriminate attacks.&nbsp; And the President’s comments speak to the horror, the brutality that Russia and President Putin are inflicting.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, they are in control of their own &#8212; the global perception of them is based on their actions.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And one quick other one.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Oh, go ahead.&nbsp; Yeah, go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, you mentioned that the President spoke to Judge Brown Jackson last night.&nbsp; Is there any other details you can share just about how she&#8217;s been preparing for the hearings, who&#8217;s been involved in the practice sessions, or &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; I mean, I had outlined for you guys a couple of weeks ago some of the members of her team who played a role in preparing her, of course, whether it was Dana Remus or Senator Jones and Ben LaBolt, Minyon Moore &#8212; others who have been playing a role in preparing her for the hearings.</p>



<p>I would note &#8212; which won&#8217;t surprise anyone, given her credentials &#8212; she began preparing and studying and getting ready for these hearings as soon as she was nominated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I would note that also, over the course of the last few weeks, she&#8217;s also met with every single member of the Judiciary Committee and then several more members beyond that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, she has been both meeting and preparing for the last few weeks, ever since she was nominated, with the team internally and externally that we had announced just a few weeks ago.</p>



<p>Go ahead, Zolan.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does the administration expect to discuss the &#8212; Poland&#8217;s offer on the MiG fighter jets at this point?&nbsp; Or is the stance that the Pentagon has made the decision clear at that point and this won&#8217;t be a subject in anticipation of the President&#8217;s trip to Poland?</p>



<p>And then secondly, during the Vice President&#8217;s trip to Poland, the Pol- &#8212; Polish leaders, at that point, said one thing that &#8212; one ask that they had in that bilateral was to expedite the processing of Ukrainian refugees who have relatives in the United States.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does &#8212; is the administration expecting to oblige on that request or meet halfway in any way?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; So, I would say that, while we have done our own assessment here on the Polish jets based on a couple of factors that the military &#8212; as you as you noted, Zolan &#8212; has outlined, including what&#8217;s most effective in fighting this war on the ground, the risk assessment of what would be escalatory, and also the fact that the Ukrainians have a number of squadrons that they can utilize.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But if Poland &#8212; if they want to raise this, I&#8217;m &#8212; you know, these &#8212; these conversations, these diplomatic negotia- &#8212; or conversations are two ways, right?&nbsp; And we&#8217;ll, of course, read out their meeting once it &#8212; once it is complete.&nbsp; So, we&#8217;ll see what they &#8212; what they raise in that meeting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In terms of refugees, we are &#8212; we have taken a number of steps.&nbsp; And we do &#8212; part of what the President wants to do is thank President Duda for the efforts of Poland in welcoming refugees, and talk about what we can do to continue to provide support.</p>



<p>Now, to date, that has been largely financial support, humanitarian support, even as we granted Temporary Protected Status, and also &#8212; you know, just &#8212; just a few weeks ago.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But what we are doing and continuing to assess is what &#8212; if there are Ukrainian nationals who are not able to remain safely in Europe and for whom resettlement the United States is a better option, we are continuing to work with <s>UNCR</s> [UNHCR] and the EU to consider that. </p>



<p>And that might require &#8212; because typically, individuals who are seeking refugee status have to go to a third country.&nbsp; So that&#8217;s something we&#8217;re looking at and assessing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And we&#8217;re also &#8212; the UNHCR, the U.N. Refugee Agency, is working with the State Department and many resettlement partners and our overseas posts to determine where the Ukrainian nationals and others who have fled Ukraine were &#8212; you know, whether there&#8217;s more we can do beyond the humanitarian assistance that we are providing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, I&#8217;m certain it will be a point of discussion.&nbsp; We are having ongoing discussions internally about what more we can do to welcome refugees.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And specifically, the thing that&#8217;s different about that process that the administration is looking at is allowing Ukrainians to basically finish the refugee process in that same country that they would receive a UNHCR referral?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; That&#8217;s part of the discussion is what can ha- &#8212; what can be done if Ukrainian nationals are not able to remain safely in Europe, for example, and for whom resettlement in the United States would be a better option for a range of reasons &#8212; the State Department is discussing with UNHCR and the EU how to consider them, what would be required for that process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But this is an ongoing discussion internally.&nbsp; And I&#8217;m certain it will be a part of the discussion, to go back to your original question, with President Duda, as well, this weekend.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead, Matt.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; You had written on Twitter that the President &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Uh-oh.&nbsp; (Laughter.)</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; did not plan to go to Ukraine &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; on his trip.&nbsp; Given that the prime ministers of Poland, Slovenia, and the Czech Republic visited Kyiv last week and that President Zelenskyy was urging others to do the same, can you talk a little bit about whether President Biden had explored going to Ukraine at all, if he was asked to, and sort of what considerations went into the factors either way?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; We have not explored that option.&nbsp; I put that &#8212; I tweeted, I guess I should say, because there was some confusion about this question, and we did not want to leave that out there as an unanswered question.</p>



<p>But certainly, any president of the United States traveling into a war zone requires not only security considerations but also an enormous amount of resources on the ground, which is always a factor for us as we make considerations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But also, the President felt and our national security team felt that he could have the most effective and impactful trip by convening these meetings with NATO leaders, the G7, the EU in Brussels to determine both continued military coordination, humanitarian and economic coordination, as well as by going to visit Poland, right next door, to talk about everything from refugees, refugee assistance, and continued assistance we can all provide together.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, it was a decision made about what &#8212; what would be most effective on the trip.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then I just wanted to follow up quickly.&nbsp; You had said earlier that the President was unable to watch the opening statement of the judge in the Supreme Court hearings.&nbsp; I think she &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; He was on with the Quint.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That’s right.&nbsp; But she has to sit through the opening statements, first, of all of these senators, so I don&#8217;t think she&#8217;s actually given her opening statement quite yet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Ah, there you go.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you know if there&#8217;s time carved into his schedule?&nbsp; Does he plan &#8212; through the afternoon?&nbsp; Is he following this?&nbsp; Or &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, some of these are a little difficult to predict, as just evidenced.&nbsp; Thank you for giving me a lifeline there, because, clearly, I&#8217;ve been in meetings this morning as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You know, he &#8212; it was hard to plan his schedule around this, so what he asked is that he be provided updates from his team and aides as the &#8212; as the hearings progress.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And obviously, Chairman Durbin gave his opening, Senator Grassley gave his opening this morning, and it proceeds.&nbsp; But it&#8217;s hard to plan the President&#8217;s schedule around a moving Senate hearing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;ll be able to watch replays of it and more specifics, but he wanted updates from aides as well.</p>



<p>Go ahead.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; On &#8212; on oil, President Biden has been very vocal about his belief that U.S. producers should be producing more and that there&#8217;s the possibility of price gouging, but he didn&#8217;t raise any of those concerns in the meeting of oil CEOs earlier today?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; He &#8212; it wasn&#8217;t a meeting with oil CEOs.&nbsp; There were a couple of the 18 &#8212; or 16 to 18 CEOs there.&nbsp; It was not intended to be a meeting with oil CEOs; it was intended to be a meeting with a broad swath of the economic sectors.&nbsp; And he provided them an update on Russia and Ukraine, so it wasn&#8217;t meant to be that type of a meeting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then there was a report in the Washington Post earlier, saying that Biden administratia- &#8212; administration officials are seeing data showing that Russian oil exports have dropped off a cliff and that there was some &#8212; there was a data point that said there are 2 million barrels per day on tankers that have gone from close &#8212; down to zero in a certain period of time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Is that &#8212; can you confirm that?&nbsp; Is that &#8212; is that true in what you&#8217;re seeing about Russian oil exports?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I&#8217;ve seen those reports, but I don&#8217;t have a new assessment from here.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, lastly, has the President tested for COVID-19 this week?&nbsp; And what were the results of that test?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; He was tested today, and he was negative.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.&nbsp; Can you walk us through the administration&#8217;s thinking behind adding this Poland stop?&nbsp; And what is President Biden hoping to demonstrate by sitting alongside President Duda?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure. &nbsp;Well, we have &#8212; this &#8212; this trip has been coming together quite rapidly, I think, as you would all note.&nbsp; And so, as I noted a little bit earlier, we will have more details about his Poland stop.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But this is an opportunity for him to thank President Duda for welcoming refugees, as they have done over the last few weeks, and for being an important partner in providing a range of assistance to the Ukrainians &#8212; to the Ukrainian people and the Ukrainian government. &nbsp;And they are an important partner as we &#8212; as we work to remain unified in the weeks and months ahead.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There will obviously be a couple of components of his trip there, which I think, as we have more details of it to announce, will showcase the purpose of the trip.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, to follow on that, one of my colleagues asked if the President would be meeting with Ukrainian refugees in &#8212; at one of these stops.&nbsp; Is there any reason why the President wouldn&#8217;t?&nbsp; Is that something we can find out more about soon?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I think, as I noted, we&#8217;re going to be providing more details to all of you in the next 24 hours, of his trip.&nbsp; Sometimes there are things we announce in advance, and sometimes there are not.&nbsp; But I&#8217;ve noted repeatedly that refugees is a key component of his stop in Poland.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; If I can shift gears to COVID for a minute &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the White House&#8217;s response to some experts who have said that the U.S. is not necessarily doing enough to prepare for this next bit of a pandemic surge that we&#8217;re already beginning to see in other parts of the globe?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would say &#8212; I&#8217;m not sure &#8212; can you give me a little more additional context of the comments?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had seen &#8212; yes, some comments just basically that the U.S. needs to be doing more to prepare, whether that is around, you know, building up a supply.&nbsp; They pointed to the low rates of booster shots, in particular, as being a point of concern.&nbsp; And that was &#8212; yeah.&nbsp; And the booster shots, in particular.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I think our primary concern right now is that we&#8217;re about to run out of funding, and we are always making an effort to be ahead of and be prepared for any new wave, any new variant.</p>



<p>And even as BA.2 has been in this country for some time &#8211;and, as of last week, it was about a quarter to a third of cases.&nbsp; We know it&#8217;s quite transmissible, but we know that the treatments we have are effective in treating BA.2 &#8212; the BA.2 variant. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Our concern right now is that we are going to run out of money to provide the types of vaccines, boosters, treatments to the immunocompromised and others free of charge that will help continue to battle increasing &#8212; you know, the increase or the upflow or the, you know, increase of &#8212; of COVID in the future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So that&#8217;s where our primary focus is.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t &#8212; beyond that, I&#8217;m not sure additional context of those comments.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I ask just more question.&nbsp; Has the White House been in touch with any of the pharmaceutical companies who are specifically working on the under-age-five population, recently, vaccines?&nbsp; I know that those were put into practice and then removed in terms of actually having implementation.&nbsp; I just wondered what the communication has been.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah, well, the &#8212; it typically goes, of course, through the FDA and CDC, as it should &#8212; all of the data.&nbsp; So we would leave those channels to continue to consider when it&#8217;s ready to move to the next phase.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So no sort of increased communication or urgency around getting (inaudible)?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I think data moves, science moves at the speed of science, right?&nbsp; And, of course, we would all &#8212; many people here have children under five, but it&#8217;s important that it moves through the effective, gold standard process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And of course, we are in touch with the pharmaceutical companies for a range of reasons, including purchasing supplies to plan ahead for the need for boosters and other vaccines in the future, even as we are worried about running out of money.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the process for when it would be ready to go through the FDA and CDC process is left to the scientists.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, can I ask &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, just on the food security issue &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cargill and ADM are still operating in Russia.&nbsp; A lot of companies have obviously left.&nbsp; Does the administration have a view on whether these companies should stay, given the concerns about food security and production of wheat and that sort of (inaudible)?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We have not asked any company specifically to take steps to pull out.&nbsp; We have applauded those who have made that decision, and they are going to have to make decisions of their own regard.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just a housekeeping item.&nbsp; I know you&#8217;re still getting plans for the trip.&nbsp; Do you expect the President to hold a joint news conference with President Duda after their meeting in Poland?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We&#8217;re still planning all the specifics of it, so I don’t have that quite yet.&nbsp; I would expect one for sure on Thursday.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, thank you so much.&nbsp; On Ukraine, we are seeing reports about Mariupol and about people and Ukrainians there being deported, arrested, and sent to remote regions in Russia.&nbsp; Is this something that is consistent with American intelligence?&nbsp; Can you comment on this?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I &#8212; one, those reports are horrific, but I don&#8217;t &#8212; we don&#8217;t have any independent confirmation of those reports at this point in time.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And a follow-up on China, maybe?&nbsp; So, the President has warned that China would face costs if it decided to help Russia.&nbsp; How confident is he that European allies would also support such costs?&nbsp; And will that be part of the discussion in Brussels?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I think that certainly any &#8212; the concern about China&#8217;s closer alignment with Russia is one that&#8217;s not just the United &#8212; one of the United States, it&#8217;s also a concern of many in Europe, and we expect it to be a topic of discussion over the course of the next several days.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, as I understand the peacekeeping proposal from the Polish Prime Minister: It will be a peacekeeping force, they would be in Ukraine, and they would be able to defend themselves.&nbsp; So, I know the President doesn&#8217;t want to send Americans to fight Russians, but is the U.S. open to sending Americans as part of an internationally recognized peacekeeping force that could be NATO or not NATO?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Again, these are a range of conversations that are happening behind the scenes.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll leave it to those at this point in time.&nbsp; But forces on the ground is certainly about fighting, but it&#8217;s also about having forces on the ground in Ukraine, which we have not supported at this point. &nbsp;I don&#8217;t think that will change.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; I have a question about the COVID-19 Response Team.&nbsp; Obviously, there&#8217;s going to be a change in leadership in the White House Coordinator on COVID.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, by my count, there hasn&#8217;t been a press briefing with the COVID team in about three weeks.&nbsp; I just wondered if you could speak to, kind of, what the role of that team is at this point.&nbsp; You know, how often does the President meet with that team? &nbsp;Is there any talk of disbanding it at this point, given the phase of the pandemic?&nbsp; I&#8217;m just kind of curious, sort of, what (inaudible).</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I hope not, for Dr. Jha&#8217;s sake, given he&#8217;s coming in.&nbsp; (Laughter.)</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Inaudible).</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Look, this is &#8212; communicating with all of you on a regular basis has been a huge priority for the COVID team, and I&#8217;m certain we will continue to do that.</p>



<p>And, obviously, Dr. Jha is somebody who is not just a medical expert and a doctor, but somebody who is a very effective communicator on public health issues, and we think that&#8217;s going to be a very effective part of his role.&nbsp; So, I&#8217;m certain you will be seeing a lot of him, and we will continue to have a range of briefings with the COVID team.&nbsp; So, no, they&#8217;re not disbanding.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go ahead.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll go after you.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have questions.&nbsp; First, the United States declared the Myanmar military government committed genocide against the Rohingya, today.&nbsp; We also know the Myanmar government has supported Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine.&nbsp; And what happened to the Rohingya have happened for a while now.&nbsp; So, based on the timing, are they supporting the Russia related to this declaration today?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, let me say for those of you who haven&#8217;t &#8212; I know you&#8217;ve been following it as closely, but for those of you who have not: Following a rigorous, factual, and legal analysis, the Secretary of State determined that the members of &#8212; that members of the Burmese military committed genocide and crimes against humanity against a Rohingya &#8212; against Rohingya.</p>



<p>His announcement at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum emphasizes, especially to victims and survivors, that the United States recognizes the gravity of these crimes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He also announced nearly $1 million for the Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar to support its mandate to investigate, collect, preserve, and analyze evidence of the most serious international crimes in Burma since 2011.</p>



<p>I would note that our view is that shining a light on the crimes of Burmese military will increase international pressure, make it harder for them to commit further abuses.&nbsp; But this has been &#8212; as you know, Rohingya have long faced discrimination and been subject to exclusionary policies.&nbsp; And this has been a lengthy review process at the State Department to come to this conclusion, unrelated to current events.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My second question is &#8212; we&#8217;ve been talking about being in communication with China, including President Biden&#8217;s calling the President Xi last week.&nbsp; Besides the consequences China might face if it aids Russia, does the United States also tells China what would happen to Russia right now while or might also happen to China if it invades U.S. allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific region, such as Taiwan?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; During this call, which was largely focused on Russia&#8217;s inte- &#8212; Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine, the President also reiterated his support for the Taiwan Relations Act and the one-China policy based on the Taiwan Relations Act.&nbsp; And he made clear that we remain opposed to any unilateral changes to the status quo across the Taiwan Strait, and that we have concerns about Beijing&#8217;s coercive and provocative actions.&nbsp; So that was the other topic that was discussed at the meet- &#8212; during the call.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Oh, and then we&#8217;ll go &#8212; okay, go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the United States looks to up sanctions on Russia, and given Russia&#8217;s history of assassinating dissidents, giving sanctuary to terror- &#8212; U.S.-designated terrorist organizations, would the U.S. consider labeling Russia a State Sponsor of Terrorism?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have any assessment of that at this point in time.&nbsp; Obviously, we&#8217;re continuing to look at the actions on the ground and the actions of leaders.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Two immigration questions for you.&nbsp; First, I wanted to confirm whether the administration supports an Afghan Adjustment Act; that&#8217;s potential legislation that would secure permanent status for those thousands of evacuees that are here.&nbsp; It would go beyond, obviously, the TPS designation last week, which is 18 months.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; I&#8217;d have to check with our Department of Homeland Security.&nbsp; Obviously, we just announced Temporary Protected Status last week, and we&#8217;re continuing to assess and consider a range of ways to welcome and &#8212; our Afghan partners.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, just quickly: It&#8217;s been two years since President Trump implemented Title 42.&nbsp; There are protests outside the White House today.&nbsp; Democrats are now actively calling for it to end.&nbsp; COVID cases are low.&nbsp; Is the administration at least preparing for the possibility that this can end?&nbsp; And how so?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure. &nbsp;There are timelines, including, I think, upcoming in April, on when it&#8217;s &#8212; continues to be reconsidered.&nbsp; And those discussions happen among the health experts from the CDC and other medical experts within the administration.</p>



<p>And you always have to prepare, because if they make that decision, there would be an implementation that would be, in part, led by the Department of Homeland Security and others that you have to plan for.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does that include preparing for a large influx of migrants at the border, specifically?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, certainly that would be part of it if &#8212; if and when the CDC makes that determination.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Thanks, everyone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I ask you &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We&#8217;ll have Jake here tomorrow.&nbsp; Lots of questions, I&#8217;m sure you have.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thank you, everyone.</p>



<p>3:41 P.M. EDT</p>

<p>Today, Secretary of Treasury Janet Yellen, Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, Senior Advisor Cedric Richmond, and National Economic Council Director Brian Deese met with 16 CEOs of major companies across several industries including energy, food, and manufacturing to provide a briefing on the latest developments on Putin’s unprovoked and unjustified war against Ukraine.  The President joined for part of the discussion. They conveyed the Administration’s commitment to continue imposing heavy costs on Putin to degrade Russia’s war machine and support the people of Ukraine, while taking concrete actions to mitigate the price increases on American consumers caused by Putin’s action. Participants also discussed the need to work together to address Putin’s disruptions to global markets and supply chains, especially for energy and agricultural commodities, and identify alternative sources of supply for key goods. The private sector and the Administration committed to close communication and coordination going forward.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>This is a critical moment to accelerate our work to improve domestic cybersecurity and bolster our national resilience. &nbsp;I have previously warned about the potential that Russia could conduct malicious cyber activity against the United States, including as a response to the unprecedented economic costs we’ve imposed on Russia alongside our allies and partners. It’s part of Russia’s playbook. Today, my Administration is reiterating those warnings based on evolving intelligence that the Russian Government is exploring options for potential cyberattacks.</p>



<p>From day one, my Administration has worked to strengthen our national cyber defenses, mandating extensive cybersecurity measures for the Federal Government and those critical infrastructure sectors where we have authority to do so, and creating innovative public-private partnerships and initiatives to enhance cybersecurity across all our critical infrastructure. Congress has partnered with us on these efforts — we appreciate that Members of Congress worked across the aisle to require companies to report cyber incidents to the United States Government.</p>



<p>My Administration will continue to use every tool to deter, disrupt, and if necessary, respond to cyberattacks against critical infrastructure. But the Federal Government can’t defend against this threat alone. Most of America’s critical infrastructure is owned and operated by the private sector and critical infrastructure owners and operators must accelerate efforts to lock their digital doors. The Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has been actively working with organizations across critical infrastructure to rapidly <a href="http://www.CISA.gov/Shields-Up">share information and mitigation guidance</a> to help protect their systems and networks</p>



<p>If you have not already done so, I urge our private sector partners to <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/03/21/fact-sheet-act-now-to-protect-against-potential-cyberattacks/">harden your cyber defenses immediately</a> by implementing the best practices we have developed together over the last year. You have the power, the capacity, and the responsibility to strengthen the cybersecurity and resilience of the critical services and technologies on which Americans rely. We need everyone to do their part to meet one of the defining threats of our time — your vigilance and urgency today can prevent or mitigate attacks tomorrow.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>The Biden-Harris Administration has warned repeatedly about the potential for Russia to engage in malicious cyber activity against the United States in response to the unprecedented economic sanctions we have imposed.&nbsp; There is now evolving intelligence that Russia may be exploring options for potential cyberattacks.</p>



<p>The Administration has prioritized strengthening cybersecurity defenses to prepare our Nation for threats since day one. President Biden’s Executive Order is modernizing the Federal Government defenses and improving the security of widely-used technology. The President has launched public-private action plans to shore up the cybersecurity of the electricity, pipeline, and water sectors and has directed Departments and Agencies to use all existing government authorities to mandate new cybersecurity and network defense measures. Internationally, the Administration brought together more than 30 allies and partners to cooperate to detect and disrupt ransomware threats, rallied G7 countries to hold accountable nations who harbor ransomware criminals, and taken steps with partners and allies to publicly attribute malicious activity.</p>



<p>We accelerated our work in November of last year as Russian President Vladimir Putin escalated his aggression ahead of his further invasion of Ukraine with extensive briefings and advisories to U.S. businesses regarding potential threats and cybersecurity protections. The U.S. Government will continue our efforts to provide resources and tools to the private sector, including via <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/shields-up">CISA’s Shields-Up campaign</a> and we will do everything in our power to defend the Nation and respond to cyberattacks. But the reality is that much of the Nation’s critical infrastructure is owned and operated by the private sector and the private sector must act to protect the critical services on which all Americans rely.</p>



<p>We urge companies to execute the following steps with urgency:</p>



<ul><li>Mandate the use of multi-factor authentication on your systems to make it harder for attackers to get onto your system;<br></li><li>Deploy modern security tools on your computers and devices to continuously look for and mitigate threats;<br></li><li>Check with your cybersecurity professionals to make sure that your systems are patched and protected against all known vulnerabilities, and change passwords across your networks so that previously stolen credentials are useless to malicious actors;<br></li><li>Back up your data and ensure you have offline backups beyond the reach of malicious actors;<br></li><li>Run exercises and drill your emergency plans so that you are prepared to respond quickly to minimize the impact of any attack;<br></li><li>Encrypt your data so it cannot be used if it is stolen;<br></li><li>Educate your employees to common tactics that attackers will use over email or through websites, and encourage them to report if their computers or phones have shown unusual behavior, such as unusual crashes or operating very slowly; and<br></li><li>Engage proactively with your local FBI field office or CISA Regional Office to establish relationships in advance of any cyber incidents. Please encourage your IT and Security leadership to visit the websites of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/shields-up">CISA</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fbi.gov/investigate/cyber">FBI</a>&nbsp;where they will find technical information and other useful resources.</li></ul>



<p>We also must focus on bolstering America’s cybersecurity over the long term. We encourage technology and software companies to:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Build security into your products from the ground up — “bake it in, don’t bolt it on” — to protect both your intellectual property and your customers’ privacy.<br></li><li>Develop software only on a system that is highly secure and accessible only to those actually working on a particular project.&nbsp; This will make it much harder for an intruder to jump from system to system and compromise a product or steal your intellectual property.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Use modern tools to check for known and potential vulnerabilities. Developers can fix most software vulnerabilities — if they know about them.&nbsp; There are automated tools that can review code and find most coding errors before software ships, and before a malicious actor takes advantage of them.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul><li>Software developers are responsible for all code used in their products, including open source code. Most software is built using many different components and libraries, much of which is open source.&nbsp; Make sure developers know the provenance (i.e., origin) of components they are using and have a “software bill of materials” in case one of those components is later found to have a vulnerability so you can rapidly correct it.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul><li>Implement the security practices mandated in the President’s Executive Order, <em>Improving our Nation’s Cybersecurity</em>. Pursuant to that EO, all software the U.S. government purchases is now required to meet security standards in how it is built and deployed. We encourage you to follow those practices more broadly.</li></ul>
