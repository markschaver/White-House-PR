<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Vice President’s Ceremonial Office</em></p>



<p>10:44 A.M. EDT&nbsp;<br><br>VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: &nbsp;Okay, good morning, everyone. &nbsp;It is my great honor and pleasure to welcome President Hassan. &nbsp;I bring you greetings, of course, from President Biden as well. &nbsp;And we welcome you for this trip.&nbsp;<br><br>As, Madam President, you know, the United States feels very strongly that Tanzania is a very important partner. &nbsp;And we know, of course, and many Americans have appreciated the incredible natural wonders of Tanzania &#8212; be it the Serengeti or Mount Kilimanjaro, where many Americans have traveled and come back with stories that have lasted a lifetime in terms of the memories.&nbsp;<br><br>You, of course, in Tanzania have a vibrant multicultural society, stretching from the savanna of the mainland to the beaches of Zanzibar.&nbsp;<br><br>So, we do appreciate all that Tanzania represents, both historically and in terms of just the natural beauty of your country.&nbsp;<br><br>And over 60 years ago, we, the United States, sent some of our first Peace Corps volunteers to Tanzania. &nbsp;And the relationship, of course, has grown stronger and warmer ever since. &nbsp;And we&#8217;ve seen great progress during this time, but we also recognize there is more to do.&nbsp;<br><br>I&#8217;m looking forward to our discussion today. &nbsp;There are three areas that I know we will focus on in particular. &nbsp;One is with regard to what we will do together to strengthen democracy. &nbsp;And we welcome the progress that you have made during the course of your leadership and, in particular, the work you have done to empower women leaders in Tanzania and the work you have done to support human rights.&nbsp;<br><br>Our conversation will also cover the importance of the economic growth of Tanzania, which I know is one of your highest priorities and a main purpose for your visit to the United States. &nbsp;We welcome, of course, the attention you are giving to that and that the focus of this trip includes, in the United States, focusing on the investment opportunities as it relates to the economy as a general matter, but also in the area of tourism.&nbsp;<br><br>And your trip has also generated nearly $1 billion in new investments from companies in the United States. &nbsp;And that has and will contribute, no doubt, to the economic growth of Tanzania but, in that way, will contribute to the growth &#8212; the economic growth and jobs in the United States as well.&nbsp;<br><br>The third matter that we will discuss that has been a priority for our two nations and for the world is the issue of public health, global health, and, in particular, COVID-19 and other health issues. &nbsp;We will discuss today what we will do together to address those needs and those issues.&nbsp;<br><br>It is our strong belief that as COVID is an issue for any country, it is an issue for all of us. &nbsp;And it is with that spirit that we approach this discussion and our role, as it relates to Tanzania and the work that you are doing to address the issue of COVID, but also the work that you have prioritized around the health of women and children in Tanzania. &nbsp;So, I look forward to our conversation on that.&nbsp;<br><br>And I&#8217;ll conclude these comments by saying that our administration is deeply committed to strengthening the ties to Tanzania and to African countries in general. &nbsp;This has been an area of intentional focus and priority for both the President and for me.&nbsp;<br><br>And with that, again, welcome, Madam President. &nbsp;And I look forward to our discussion.&nbsp;<br><br>PRESIDENT HASSAN: &nbsp;Thank you. &nbsp;Thank you. &nbsp;Thank you, Madam Vice President. &nbsp;And I must say that I&#8217;m pleased to be here at the White House. &nbsp;And I thank you, Madam Vice President &#8212; I thank you, Madam Vice President, for having me here.&nbsp;<br><br>It makes more exciting to be here for obvious reason: that we&#8217;ll be able to exchange a lot of experiences in what we are doing, as you have also mentioned. &nbsp;And on that note, I bring goodwill message of friendship from &#8212; and solidarity from the government and the people of the United Republic of Tanzania.&nbsp;<br><br>And as this is the first time we are meeting in person since assumption of office, I would like to congratulate President Joe Biden and yourself, of course, Madam Kamala, and the Democratic Party for their resounding victory during the presidential election in 2020.&nbsp;<br><br>We, in Tanzania, have been following very closely that election because there &#8212; for the first time, there was a woman contesting for the vice president position. &nbsp;So, we were very inspired.&nbsp;<br><br>So, let me say that the United States and Tanzania have enjoyed excellent relation for the last 60 years. &nbsp;My government would like to see our relation grow further and strengthened to greater heights.&nbsp;<br><br>I would like to express my government&#8217;s appreciation to the U.S. government for their invaluable development assistance and great work the USAID has been doing in Tanzania over the years, particularly for socioeconomic development and in uplifting the lives of many Tanzanians through various programs and initiatives, including PEPFAR, the Presidential Malaria Initiative, Feed for Future &#8212; or Feed the Future for food security, just to mention a few of them.&nbsp;<br><br>Talking on COVID-19, my country is indeed grateful to the U.S. support in its donation of COVID-19 vaccines through the COVAX facility. &nbsp;To date, the U.S. has so far contributed close to 5 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines to my country.&nbsp;<br><br>It was just last month I had a virtual meeting with the USAID Administrator, Madam Samantha Power. &nbsp;And during our conversation, she revealed that Tanzania was one of the 11 beneficiaries of the Global Vaccine Initiative launched by President Joe Biden. &nbsp;Yeah.<br><br>So, talking on human rights and rule of law and democracy, Tanzania have made commendable strides in these areas, as you have mentioned, and we are committed to taking deliberate measures to ensure inclusion, cooperation, unity, and respect for all Tanzanians.&nbsp;<br><br>And in so doing, the political parties and stakeholders convened meetings to deliberate on collective and productive ways of running political activities in our country while, at the same time, safeguarding country’s interest. &nbsp;So, these meetings have been instrumental in contributing positively to enhancing democracy and strengthening multiparty system in our country, in Tanzania.&nbsp;<br><br>Now, talking on trade and investment, I must say that I&#8217;m excited about the prospects of promoting further trade and investment ties of mutual &#8212; for mutual benefits. &nbsp;And in &#8212; cognizant of that, we need to create an &#8212; an ease of doing business. &nbsp;And my government, in close collaboration with the private sector, has put in place better conditions and favorable environment for the private sector to thrive.&nbsp;<br><br>So, my only request here is to &#8212; for the U.S. government to encourage more the private sector from the U.S. to work with us in Tanzania. &nbsp;There&#8217;s a lot to be offered. &nbsp;We have a lot of potential. &nbsp;So, you are welcome.&nbsp;<br><br>Moreover, the government is collaboration &#8212; with the collaboration with the private sector, is in the process of enacting the Tanzania Investment Act, expected to set the tone for creating the safe lending for investors. &nbsp;So, we are creating &#8212; we are doing all what we can to make the private sector working comfortably in Tanzania.&nbsp;<br><br>Finally, Madam Vice President, I wish to inform you that while I&#8217;m here in the United States, I&#8217;ll also launch “The Royal Tour” program. &nbsp;This program is created to showcase Tanzania&#8217;s touristic and investment potentials.&nbsp;<br><br>The selection of United States, the place for launching, was not by accident. &nbsp;We are aware that &#8212; and we did it intentionally, knowing that this is where the lovers and shakers of entertainment and leisure reside. &nbsp;(Laughter.)&nbsp;<br><br>VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: &nbsp;Indeed.<br><br>PRESIDENT HASSAN: &nbsp;And that&#8217;s creating an excellent platform for the visibili- &#8212; visibility of the program across the globe. &nbsp;<br><br>Indeed, it is my hope that the launch of this program will inspire so many people to visit our wonderous country in the not-so-distant future.&nbsp;<br><br>Madam President, I once again thank you for having me here &#8212; for having me here in the statehouse, and looking forward to fruitful discussion.&nbsp;<br><br>Thank you, Madam Vice President. &nbsp;Thank you.<br><br>VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: &nbsp;Thank you, Madam President. &nbsp;Thank you, Madam President. &nbsp;Thank you.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;END &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 10:54 A.M.

<p>Tonight, Jewish communities in the United States, Israel, and around the world will celebrate Passover, a holiday whose ancient story has inspired humanity for millennia.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For many, this will mark the first time in three years that families and friends will be able to gather around the Seder table – a testament to the life-saving miracle of modern medicine and the progress we’ve made to address an unforgiving pandemic.</p>



<p>Together again, we will commemorate the Exodus of the enslaved Israelites from Egypt. And we will retell a timeless story about that most human quest for freedom. Redemption. Faith. Hope. And, ultimately, deliverance. A story that has brought solace and a sense of promise to Jewish communities throughout their history as they endured acts of persecution, pogroms, and even genocide. And one that inspired and empowered oppressed peoples everywhere who, even in their deepest despair, sensed that their own liberation was not beyond reach.</p>



<p>This Passover, we hold in our hearts the people of Ukraine and those around the world whose heroic stand against tyranny inspires us all. The enduring spirit of this holiday&nbsp;continues to teach us that with faith, the driest desert can be crossed, the mightiest sea can be split, and hope never stops marching towards the promised land.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To all those celebrating this Festival of Freedom, Jill and I wish you and your loved ones a Happy Passover. <em>Chag Sameach</em>!</p>

<p>Americans are getting back to work in every corner of the country in record numbers. Right now, 17 states are at or tied with the lowest unemployment rate they’ve ever had – and 20 states have jobless rates below 3%. Over the last year, the unemployment rate dropped in every state and many states have reached historic lows.&nbsp;These aren’t just numbers on a page: these are millions of Americans back at work and able to support themselves and their families with good-paying jobs and enjoy the dignity a job provides.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This wasn’t an accident: this was the direct result of my economic plan to grow the economy from the bottom up and middle out. There’s still more work to do to build on this recovery and bring down costs for working families – and my Administration is working on that every day – but we can’t lose sight of how far, and how quickly, we’ve come.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the Great Smoky Mountains in North Carolina and Tennessee, to the wonderous sights of the Grand Canyon in Arizona, to the vast hidden treasures of the Channel Islands in&nbsp;California, our cherished national parks are home to so many of those most beautiful places on Earth, places that astonish us, inspire us, and fill us with a sense of pride and belonging. &nbsp;During National Park Week, we celebrate the natural splendor of our national parks and show our appreciation for the Department of the Interior and National Park Service&#8217;s dedicated stewardship of them.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last month, our Nation celebrated the 150th&nbsp;anniversary of Yellowstone National Park &#8212; the world&#8217;s first national park and a place that holds many treasured memories for me. &nbsp;The desire to protect&nbsp;and share the indescribable beauty, bountiful wildlife,&nbsp;and natural resources of Yellowstone laid the foundation for what would become America&#8217;s national parks system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To protect our Nation&#8217;s outdoors and all of its marvels, I was proud to launch the &#8220;America the Beautiful&#8221; initiative &#8212; the first-ever voluntary national conservation effort with a goal to conserve 30 percent of our country&#8217;s lands and waters by&nbsp;2030.&nbsp; I have called for a whole-of-government approach that supports locally-led efforts to conserve and restore lands and waters across the country.&nbsp; In doing so, we will address the interconnected climate and biodiversity crises that our planet faces and also allow more people in more communities to have access to nature and the physical and spiritual nourishment it provides.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Historic investments through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Great American Outdoors Act are also allowing us to revitalize our national parks and public lands by modernizing facilities and addressing the extensive&nbsp;deferred maintenance and&nbsp;repair backlog. &nbsp;These laws also allow us to make progress on pollution clean-up, environmental sustainability, climate resiliency,&nbsp;and green energy initiatives.&nbsp; Through these important upgrades and restoration efforts, we will make it possible for more people to enjoy our national parks, today and&nbsp;for generations to come.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My Administration is working to fully engage with Tribal Nations by acknowledging their history and learning from their ancestral and modern connections to our national parks.&nbsp; By recognizing Native American Tribes&#8217; connection to this land since time immemorial and finding opportunities to collaborate on managing our shared lands and waters, we can preserve Native American Tribes&#8217; rich histories while safeguarding America&#8217;s national parks for future generations.&nbsp; The National Park Service is also working with stakeholders to connect more Americans to our national parks, incorporating the experiences, backgrounds, and history of every community that these sites represent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As part of my Administration&#8217;s efforts to advance equity, diversity,&nbsp;and inclusion,&nbsp;we have made a priority of creating equitable access to our shared natural resources.&nbsp; Through programs funded by the Land&nbsp;and&nbsp;Water Conservation Fund, such as&nbsp;the Outdoor Recreation Legacy Partnership,&nbsp;we are working with communities to develop and preserve&nbsp;green space, reinvigorating existing national parks, and expanding opportunities to forge connections between people and the outdoors, particularly in economically underserved areas. &nbsp;By&nbsp;tackling the intersecting challenges of environmental and racial justice, we will create a future where all Americans can&nbsp;enjoy everything that our national parks have to offer.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we have learned throughout the COVID-19 pandemic,&nbsp;providing easy and equitable&nbsp;access to the great outdoors is vital for our physical, mental,&nbsp;and social health. &nbsp;National parks, trails,&nbsp;and other close-to-home public spaces create opportunities for us to get outdoors, enjoy fresh air,&nbsp;and socialize or find sanctuary.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our national parks serve as a source of recreation, inspiration, and spirit.&nbsp; They are, indeed, America&#8217;s best idea. &nbsp;I encourage all Americans to take some time during National Park Week to connect with our national parks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 16 through April 24, 2022, as National Park Week. &nbsp; I encourage all Americans to find their park, recreate responsibly, and enjoy the benefits that come from spending time in the natural world.</p>



<p>     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-sixth.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-right">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>Over the past year, we have seen that the American spirit of service is alive and well. &nbsp;Every day, Americans are giving their love and labor to care for seniors, help communities rebuild after disasters, support veterans and military families, tackle climate change, guide and mentor our youth, serve and strengthen the democratic process, feed the hungry, and keep communities healthy and safe. &nbsp;Tens of millions of Americans collectively volunteer billions of hours of their time each year. &nbsp;This commitment to service represents the best of who we&nbsp;are as Americans.&nbsp; During National Volunteer Week, we recognize the contributions that our Nation&#8217;s volunteers make every day and encourage all Americans to discover their path to&nbsp;making a&nbsp;difference.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We also need to call on that spirit more than ever as we&nbsp;help our Nation recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. &nbsp;For example, we need volunteers in education to help students get back on track, and I encourage Americans to support our youth by&nbsp;serving as tutors and mentors or in other critical roles. As&nbsp;we tackle the pandemic and so many other challenges, government has a&nbsp;role to play, but our Nation is stronger, more connected, and best prepared for the future when government, nonprofits, community organizations, the private sector, and the American people work together.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Volunteering also benefits the volunteers. &nbsp;People who volunteer develop new skills, build their personal and professional networks, forge a deeper connection with their communities and service organizations, and experience the joy of&nbsp;serving a larger cause.&nbsp; The opportunities to volunteer are seemingly limitless.&nbsp; Students gain real world experience, workers apply their skills to organizations that benefit from their experience and often develop new skills in the process, and older Americans improve their health and longevity. &nbsp;At&nbsp;every age and stage in life, volunteers experience the profound joy of giving back. &nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Volunteerism is also a reinforcing cycle. &nbsp;Volunteers are more likely to become further involved in volunteer groups, participate in civic organizations, attend public meetings, and&nbsp;lend a helping hand to their neighbors.&nbsp; Serving together in common purpose has the power to unite us across the lines that sometimes divide. &nbsp;As I pursue a unity agenda in the Congress, volunteering serves as a unity agenda for our national life. &nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vice President Harris and I salute all of our fellow Americans who take time to help others in need and the faith-based, nonprofit, national service, military service, and community organizations that make their service possible.&nbsp; My&nbsp;Administration is committed to encouraging and advancing volunteer service throughout our Nation and the world. &nbsp;Through AmeriCorps &#8212; a network of service programs across our country that helps meet community needs &#8212; we are removing barriers to service, expanding volunteer opportunities, and focusing on our Nation&#8217;s toughest challenges. &nbsp;AmeriCorps increased the living allowance for national service members through funding from the American Rescue Plan and is working with partners to recruit volunteers in underserved communities so that service opportunities are more accessible. &nbsp;To serve communities abroad in their response and recovery efforts from the pandemic, the Peace Corps has developed criteria and processes to return volunteers around the world.&nbsp; I encourage all Americans to learn&nbsp;how get involved by visiting AmeriCorps.gov and peacecorps.gov/volunteer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in&nbsp;me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 17 through April 23, 2022, as National Volunteer Week. &nbsp;I call upon all Americans to observe this week by volunteering in service projects across the country and pledging to make service a part of their daily lives.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this</p>



<p>fifteenth day of April, in the year of our Lord two&nbsp;thousand&nbsp;twenty-two, and of the Independence of the United&nbsp;States of&nbsp;America the two&nbsp;hundred and forty-sixth.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-right">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>Today, I am announcing my intent to nominate Michael Barr as the next Vice Chair for Supervision of the Federal Reserve. &nbsp;Michael brings the expertise and experience necessary for this important position at a critical time for our economy and families across the country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since I took office, the economy has created nearly 8 million jobs, and millions of families have the dignity a paycheck can provide and a little bit more breathing room. I know that rising prices and inflation are straining families’ budgets. While I’m doing everything in my power to lower prices for families, the Federal Reserve plays a critical role in fighting inflation and Barr will make a strong Vice &nbsp;Chair Supervision, joining my other nominees for the Federal Reserve that the Senate is considering. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Barr has spent his career protecting consumers, and during his time at Treasury, played a critical role in creating both the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the position for which I am nominating him. He was instrumental in the passage of Dodd-Frank, to ensure a future financial crisis would not create devastating economic hardship for working families. &nbsp;Barr has strong support from across the political spectrum – and has been confirmed by the Senate on a bipartisan basis. And, he understands that this job is not a partisan one, but one that plays a critical role in regulating our nation’s financial institutions to ensure Americans are treated fairly and to protect the stability of our economy.</p>



<p>I will work with Senate Banking Committee Chair Sherrod Brown to move Barr’s nomination forward quickly, and urge the Senate to swiftly confirm the four eminently qualified nominees for the Board of Governors—Jerome Powell, Lael Brainard, Philip Jefferson, and Lisa Cook— currently awaiting a vote.</p>



<p><strong>Michael Barr<br></strong>Michael S. Barr is currently the Joan and Sanford Weill Dean of the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy, the Frank Murphy Collegiate Professor of Public Policy, the Roy F. and Jean Humphrey Proffitt Professor of Law at the University of Michigan Law School, and the founder and faculty director of the University of Michigan&#8217;s Center on Finance, Law &amp; Policy. At the Law School, Barr taught Financial Regulation and International Finance, and co-founded the International Transactions Clinic and the Detroit Neighborhood Entrepreneurs Project.</p>



<p>Barr served in the Obama Administration as the U.S. Department of the Treasury&#8217;s assistant secretary for financial institutions, and was a key architect of the Dodd-Frank Act. He also served the National Economic Council in the White House. In the Clinton Administration, Barr served as Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin&#8217;s special assistant, as deputy assistant secretary of the Treasury, as special adviser to President Clinton, and as a special adviser and counselor on the policy planning staff at the U.S. Department of State.</p>



<p>Barr served as a law clerk to U.S. Supreme Court Justice David H. Souter during October Term 1993, and previously to the Hon. Pierre N. Leval, then of the Southern District of New York. He received his JD from Yale Law School, his MPhil in international relations as a Rhodes Scholar from Magdalen College, Oxford University, and his BA, summa cum laude, with honors in history, from Yale University.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Aboard Air Force One<br>En Route Greensboro, North Carolina</p>



<p>12:43 P.M. EDT</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE: &nbsp;Good morning.&nbsp; As you all know, in Greensboro to- &#8212; we’re headed to Greensboro today.&nbsp; The President will visit the Harold L. Martin Sr. Engineering Research &amp; Innovation Complex at North Carolina Agriculture and Technical State University to talk about the Bipartisan Innovation Act and his economic plan.&nbsp; N.C. A&amp;T is the largest HBCU in the country, with the highest number of African American graduates in engineering of any university nationwide.</p>



<p>The Biden-Harris administration provided over $5 billion in funding to HBCUs through the American Rescue Plan and other sources last year.&nbsp; And we are working to increase Pell Grants to support students attending two-year and four-year colleges.</p>



<p>After the Martin Complex, the President will deliver remarks highlighting provisions of the Bipartisan Innovation Act, key to retaining and strengthening our innovation and manufacturing capacity, as well as investing in STEM education and equity.</p>



<p>Greensboro is an example of a regional manufacturer &#8212; manufacturing ecosystem that the President’s agenda seeks to build across America.&nbsp; The Bipartisan Innovation Act would offer the sustained funding places like Greensboro need to create a globally competitive manufacturing industry that expands the middle class.</p>



<p>In Greensboro, the President will be joined by the EPA Administrator Michael Regan; members of his Board of Advisors on HBCUs; and several elected officials, including Governor Roy Cooper, Congresswoman Kathy Manning, Mayor of Greensboro Nancy Vaughan, and Chair of the Guilford County Board of Commissioners Skip Als- &#8212; Al- &#8212; Alston. </p>



<p>With that, Darlene.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Welcome back.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; (Inaudible.)</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that the President has said that what is happening in Ukraine is a genocide, shouldn&#8217;t the U.S. now step up and try to end what&#8217;s happening there more forcefully?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Well &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there an obligation?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Well, let me just say that &#8212; that right now, we are actively working to assist national and international efforts to (inaudible) document and investigate credible reports of atrocities, analyze the evidence, and identify any Russians responsible for the atrocities and war crimes that have been committed in Ukraine so they can be held accountable.</p>



<p>As part of that work, the U.S. is supporting the efforts of the war crimes unit under the Office of the Ukrainian Prosecutor General and a team of international prosecutors and war crimes experts who are in the region working with them.  We are also supporting Ukraine’s authorities and civil society organizations who are working on the ground to document atrocity crimes for prosecution.  And we helped establish investigations through the U.N. Human Rights Council <s>on</s> [and] the OSCE with &#8212; with release a &#8212; which released a report chronicling serious human rights violations today. </p>



<p>So that&#8217;s the process that we&#8217;re working through as we talk about &#8212; as we talk about genocide and war crimes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And is there any reaction at this point from the White House to Florida Governor DeSantis signing the 15-week abortion ban earlier today?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; I don’t have any comments on that.&nbsp; Per what we normally say about what we&#8217;re seeing nowadays when it comes to abortion, you know, we believe in codifying &#8212; the President believes in codifying Roe v. Wa- &#8212; Wade.&nbsp; We do know that women&#8217;s constitutional rights are under attack all across the country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That&#8217;s why the Biden-Harris administration is doing everything we can in response to these attacks on women&#8217;s rights.  And he&#8217;ll continue to stand with women and support their right to make their own healthcare decisions &#8212; a constitutional right that Roe v. Wade reaffirmed nearly five &#8212; five decades ago. </p>



<p>And the President, again, calls on Congress to act and send a bill to his desk to shut down these radical steps being taken.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another quick question on the trucking situation at the border in Texas.&nbsp; Does the White House understand the national security concerns that Governor Abbott is claiming is the reason that he&#8217;s ordered these inspections in the first place?&nbsp; And is &#8212; what is the White House doing or trying to do to reverse what&#8217;s happening down there?<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; So, a couple of things.&nbsp; People are asking, “Isn&#8217;t this like the tougher enforcement &#8212; border enforcement?”&nbsp; No, these truck inspections hurt Texas and U.S. trade and commerce, and will have no effect on asylum seekers.<br><br>Texas DPS &#8212; DPS work is essential for truck safety, but our border is safer when state and federal government work together.<br><br>President Biden&#8217;s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is already making historic investments to improve security at our borders.&nbsp;<br><br>CBP is used to &#8212; is used to &#8212; to working collaboratively with Texas DPS and does so routinely.&nbsp; CBP officers are very good at their jobs.&nbsp; Texas DPS does not need to replace CBP at the southern border, and attempting to do so jeopardizes public safety and America&#8217;s economic security.<br><br>CBP has conducted a record number of drug seizu- &#8212; seizes and more than 900,000 pounds of narcotics seized since FY 2021, and their Office of Field Operations seizing over 730,000 pounds of drugs at ports of entry.&nbsp;<br><br>In fiscal year 2020 [sic] through &#8212; 2022 through the end of February, CBP has already seized over 250,000 pounds of drugs due theirs &#8212; due to their stringent inspection processes.<br><br>What we&#8217;re doing: We have called on Governor Abbott to stop these unnecessary and duplicat- &#8212; duplicative inspections that are choking a key trade artery into our country.&nbsp; Staff at Laredo Field Office remained in contact with the trade communities and expanded operations to surrounding ports of entry to assist with the diverted movement of trade based on businesses’ resumption contingency plans.&nbsp;<br><br>Surrounding ports of Progreso, Rio Grande, and Roma extended their hours of operations to assist the port &#8212; the port and notify trade stakeholders.&nbsp;<br><br>The Port of Laredo extended their hours of operations at World Trade Bridge to clear and process diverted traffic from Columbia Solidarity Bridge.&nbsp;<br><br>Staff at the El Paso Field Office notified stakeholders of extended hours at the Santa Teresa port of entry to assist with congestion at Ystella [sic] &#8212; Ysleta and remains in contact with trade community to address concerns.<br><br>In all instances, port personnel have stayed and worked after hours to clear and process all commercial truck shipments at international bridges because of the increased DPS safety inspections.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karine &#8212;<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jake Sullivan, this morning, talked about an announcement in the coming days on entities that are trying to evade Russia sanctions.&nbsp; Is there more you can share &#8212; what sectors we are looking at?<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Yeah, I know he said that, but I don&#8217;t have anything more to share or preview at this time.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there anything you can say on whether or not this was a coordinated action with allies or just a U.S. announcement?<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Well, as you know, we have &#8212; we have shown our strength by coordinating with our allies and showed unity in that way as we&#8217;ve talked about many sanctions that we have pushed forward in the past couple of weeks.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And specifically on the &#8212; on the coming &#8212;<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; On this, I just don&#8217;t have anything to preview.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; And then &#8212;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you have &#8212; go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the &#8212; to follow up what the President just said about making a decision on sending officials: Who would it &#8212; who &#8212; on the discussions of who you may be sending, is it going to be a Cabinet-level official?&nbsp; Or what are we looking at?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Again, as he also &#8212; I&#8217;m just going to repeat what he said &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; &#8212; is that we&#8217;re still &#8212; we&#8217;re still in discussion, deciding this.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As you know, obviously, we&#8217;re in contact with the Ukrainian government, with Kyiv every &#8212; every day, pretty regularly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so, I just don&#8217;t have anything to preview any further.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then one more, sorry.&nbsp; If you have a reaction to Elon Musk&#8217;s hostile attempt to take over Twitter.</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Yeah, and I saw &#8212; I know that happened this morning.&nbsp; Look, this is an offer by a private investor, and we don&#8217;t have any comment here.&nbsp; The SEC is independent and would handle any review processes if this moves forward.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karine, do you have any more details about the Russian ship that was apparently sunk by Ukrainian forces?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have anything to share from here.&nbsp; I know the Department of Defense usually gives updates pretty regularly.&nbsp; I would send you to them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And following up on the sanctions question, Jen was asked about secondary sanctions yesterday.&nbsp; Can you give a sense of what secondary sanctions are being considered &#8212; financial sanctions?&nbsp; What else is in the docket?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have anything to preview.&nbsp; Let me just reiterate: Our sanctions are unprecedented.&nbsp; In no other circumstance have we moved so swiftly in such a coordinated fashion to impose devastating costs on any other country as we have done to Russia and &#8212; done to Russia.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The economy is forecast to contract as much as 15 percent of GDP in 2022.&nbsp; The economic &#8212; economic collapse will wipe out the past 15 years of economic gains in Russia.&nbsp; According to the Institute of International Finance, inflation in Russia is projected to spike about &#8212; above 20 percent and the Russian government rating has been downgraded to “junk” status by major credit rating agencies.&nbsp; Close to 400 multinational companies have left Russia in a mass exodus by the private sector, reversing 30 years of economic progress in a span of a few weeks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And we continue to ratchet up the pressure on Putin’s oligarchs.&nbsp; We are working with our &#8212; with allies and partners to go &#8212; to go after corrupt gains from some of the individuals closest to Putin.&nbsp; No matter where they are held around the world, Putin’s elites have already lost out on their most prized possessions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As long as the &#8212; as President Putin continues this war, the United States and our allies and partners are committed to ensuring the Russian government feels and &#8212; compounding efforts of our current and future economic actions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karine, the President was an hour late leaving today.&nbsp; I wonder if you could tell us anything about his activities before he left.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; So, the President had a series of morning meetings that went long today.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have any more specifics to share.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; And you mentioned the work you&#8217;re doing to support war crimes investigations in Ukraine.&nbsp; Is there anything you can tell us about the &#8212; are you sending on specific information now?&nbsp; Can you tell us anything about what that is &#8212; intercepts, satellite photos, testimony?&nbsp; And any sorts of examples that you could share?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; So, I &#8212; we are actively working to assist national inter- &#8212; national, international efforts to identify and hold any Russians accountable for the atrocities and war crimes they have committed in Ukraine.&nbsp; And we are actively consulting with our allies and partners how we can support a broad range of mechanisms moving forward.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over the past few weeks, we&#8217;ve helped establish investigations through the U.N. Human Rights Council and OSCE of possible violations by Russia.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As I mentioned earlier, the U.S. is supporting the work of the war crimes unit under the Office of Ukrainian Prosecutor General, as I mentioned, as well.</p>



<p>As the Attorney General said last week, Justice Department prosecutors were in Europe this week to meet with European prosecutors to discuss information-collection and -sharing efforts to hold Russia accountable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We also welcomed the investigation opened by the ICC Prosecutor, in particular his focus on preserving evidence of possible &#8212; possible atrocity crimes.&nbsp; As evidence is gathered, prosecutors will determine whether criminal prosecutions should be pursued.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We will do our part to support accountability using every tool available, including passing along the information we are able to gather to help build very strong dossiers of evidence for war crimes prosecutions where appropriate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s also important to remember that these mechanism will take time.&nbsp; We&#8217;re also working around the clock with allies and partners to flow weapons into Ukraine to help Ukrainians defend themselves.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karine, maybe one last question.&nbsp; National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said this morning that the administration doesn&#8217;t intend to give the frozen Russian assets back but wants to put them to better use.&nbsp; Does that mean that the administration intends to sell or liquidate those assets to finance the reconstruction of Ukraine, for example?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have more to say than what Jake Sullivan, National Security Advisor, said this morning.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have anything else to add.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I ask one more on the trip today?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Obviously, the President will focus, in his speech, on the Bipartisan Innovation Act.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re getting pretty close to the midterms here.&nbsp; And while this is a bipartisan process and, you know, the committee &#8212; the conference committee is going to, you know, do what it can, are you concerned at all that this is, like, butting up too closely to the midterms and Republicans will sort of, like, not cooperate when we get to the summer?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; So, here&#8217;s what I&#8217;ll say: The President wants to get this legislation, as you know, on his desk for his signature as soon as possible.&nbsp; We&#8217;re glad to see a bipartisan conference process starting, and we&#8217;re going to continue working closely with Congress to help iron out differences between the House and the Senate versions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the bottom line is this: The disruptions we&#8217;ve seen from the pandemic and the war in Ukraine have shown us clearly that we can&#8217;t afford to wait to make the kind of investments &#8212; like the Bipartisan Innovation Act contains &#8212; to make our economy more resilient to global shocks, to strengthen our supply chains, and to lower prices for working families.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so that’s what we’re going to do.&nbsp; We’re going to continue working with Congress to make this work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>AIDE:&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; Thank you so much.</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Thanks, guys.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Karine.</p>
