<p class="has-text-align-center">Via Teleconference</p>



<p>3:02 P.M. EDT</p>



<p>MR. MUNOZ:&nbsp; Hi, everybody.&nbsp; Thank you for joining us this afternoon for a call discussing new additional actions President Biden is taking to expand availability of infant formula supply in the United States, especially following his meeting with manufacturers and industry this afternoon.</p>



<p>A reminder this call and the factsheet that you just received are embargoed until the conclusion of the call.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On today&#8217;s call, we have [senior administration official] and [senior administration official].</p>



<p>As a reminder, this call is attributable to senior administration officials.&nbsp; And we’ll have time for questions at the end.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With that, I will kick it to [senior administration official].</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; Thanks, Kevin.&nbsp; And thank you all for joining us today to discuss actions that the President has announced to address the infant formula shortages in the country.</p>



<p>As you are all no doubt aware, on February 17th, the largest infant formula manufacturer in the country, Abbott Nutrition, initiated a voluntary recall of several of their lines of formula.&nbsp; The impacted formula was immediately pulled from the shelves and taken out of warehouse inventory across the country, and production at Abbott&#8217;s manufacturing facility in Sturgis, Michigan, was halted.</p>



<p>This voluntary action came following concerns about bacterial contamination at the facility after four infants became ill and two died in late 2021 and early 2022.</p>



<p>Over the last several months, the federal government has worked to address the production shortfall brought about by the recall.&nbsp; As a result of our ongoing work, more infant formula has been produced in the last four weeks than in the four weeks that preceded the recall, despite the fact that one of the largest infant formula production facilities in the country has been offline during that period.</p>



<p>But we also know that families across the country remain concerned about the availability of infant formula, especially families that rely on specialty products that are harder to substitute and some of which are only produced at the Michigan facility.</p>



<p>So, today, President Biden spoke with retailers and manufacturers, including the CEOs of Walmart, Target, Mead Johnson, and Gerber to talk to them about the work they are doing and call on them to do all they can to help families purchase and access infant formula.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The President discussed with Mead Johnson and Gerber their ongoing efforts to increase production.&nbsp; Their work has made up for the loss of production by Abbott.&nbsp; And the President talked to them about other ways the administration can help on top of the actions that are being announced today.</p>



<p>When the President was speaking to the CEOs of Walmart and Target, he focused on issues specific to retailers and how they are working to stock shelves, including in rural areas and regional disparities they might be seeing.</p>



<p>The President similarly asked what more his team and all of us can do to help move product and get more product to these communities.</p>



<p>Building on that work, the President today also announced several additional steps to get more infant formula onto store shelves as quickly as possible without compromising safety.</p>



<p>Both steps include, first, cutting red tape to get more infant formula to the shelves by urging states to provide flexibility in the WIC program, which can be a key driver of some supply disruptions; second, calling on FTC and state attorneys general to crack down on price gouging and unfair market practices related to the sales of infant formula, like third-party sellers reselling infant formula at steep markups; and third, increasing the supply of infant formula through increased imports.</p>



<p>These are important actions that build on the work the administration has done to date.&nbsp; And we will continue to find other ways to support the safe and rapid increase in production and distribution of infant formula.</p>



<p>So, with that, [senior administration official] and I would be happy to take your questions.</p>



<p>MR. MUNOZ:&nbsp; Thanks, [senior administration official].&nbsp; First question &#8212; we have time for just a couple &#8212; Kaitlan Collins, CNN.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks so much.&nbsp; I&#8217;m wondering what the retailers and manufacturers told the President today about how long they expect this to last.&nbsp; And when do you think &#8212; what is your assessment of when they will restart production at this facility?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Yeah, so I&#8217;m not able to share any additional details about the specific conversations.&nbsp; I will reiterate that they were productive and encouraging conversations about all the work that we can do together to support moms and families during this time.&nbsp; And we do not today have an estimate for when Abbott’s facility will come online.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But as we have said, this administration is working around the clock to do everything we can to bring as much production to market while protecting the safety and wellbeing of families.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; In addition, the manufacturers reassured us that they were going to do all that was necessary to maintain increased production levels at all their facilities to make sure that they are able to meet the needs of the market at this time.</p>



<p>MR. MUNOZ:&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; Let’s go to Jeff Mason at Reuters.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks very much.&nbsp; Can you give us more details on what you mean by increasing imports?&nbsp; The factsheet indicated that there will be an announcement about that in the coming days, if you&#8217;re able to give any more details on that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And do you have a sense of &#8212; the one piece of the factsheet that I found hard to understand was the WIC program that you also referred to.&nbsp; What impact will those changes have?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; I can take those in turn.</p>



<p>On the FDA action, I don&#8217;t have too much more to share.&nbsp; FDA is working now to make an announcement very soon about how we will be able to import more formula from abroad to lessen challenges for families, and we will certainly be in touch as we have additional details to announce there.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the WIC program, let me start, and then [senior administration official] can talk a little bit about how this affects the supply chain as a whole.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But as you all likely know, the WIC program supports the purchase of formula and other nutrition products for families of young children and moms.</p>



<p>There are, in normal times, significant rules about what products families can purchase.&nbsp; And there are also rules about how suppliers that participate in the WIC program have to maintain stock of particular supplies in order to participate in WIC.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so, USDA has been working since February with states to relax those rules and make it easier for families to substitute products and for suppliers and retailers to more flexibly participate in the WIC program.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And USDA will be urging all states to take up that &#8212; to take up those flexibilities and really alleviate burdens across the supply chain that can, again, make it difficult for families and retailers.</p>



<p>[Senior administration official], anything you want to add there?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; On the production side, what that effectively does is: When you decrease the variability and the complexity of products that a manufacturer has to make, they can institute a lot more scale efficiencies in their production process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So if you have states go from saying “We&#8217;ll only let you buy 12 ounces” for your WIC participants, and instead saying “You can buy 32-ounce containers,” then they can run more efficient production lines and only have to produce a lot of 32-ounce containers instead of 12-ounce containers.&nbsp; That just leads to faster production out of plants, quicker delivery of product from factory floor to store shelves.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And it&#8217;s important here that the states take actions that drive kind of standardization in the market like that to decrease the manufacturing complexities.</p>



<p>MR. MUNOZ:&nbsp; Let’s go to Hannah Brandt at Nexstar.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; Thanks for taking my question.&nbsp; There are a lot of lawmakers on both sides calling for the President to invoke the Defense Production Act.&nbsp; Is there any talk about that?&nbsp; Is that a future action he might take if this continues?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; So, I can take that one.&nbsp; You know, as we said at the top, we remain 100 percent focused on this issue.&nbsp; We know it’s urgent.&nbsp; We know it’s important to families and to vulnerable children.&nbsp; So we&#8217;ll continue to explore every option at the &#8212; on the table and look at any lever we can pull to address the situation.</p>



<p>We know that the recall has impacted availability of formula.&nbsp; And as you&#8217;ve heard us talk about today, we have taken measures &#8212; the FDA has taken measures, USDA has taken measures, and the companies have all taken measures here to ramp up production quickly.&nbsp; We feel &#8212; we are reassured that the companies now are back at production levels that are above the production levels that they had been right before the February 17th recall took place.&nbsp; But, again, we&#8217;re going to keep every option on the table and keep exploring things we can do.</p>



<p>MR. MUNOZ:&nbsp; All right, and we have time for a couple more questions.&nbsp; Let’s go to Kevin Robillard at Huffington Post.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, guys.&nbsp; Thanks for taking the questions.&nbsp; Thanks for doing the call.&nbsp; Why did it take so long for this issue to sort of come up the White House&#8217;s radar?&nbsp; This has obviously been building for quite some time, and it really has been, you know, pretty acute since the recall happened.&nbsp; So why wasn&#8217;t &#8212; why weren&#8217;t steps being taken, sort of, more proactively over the past few months to alleviate this problem?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Yeah, so I can assure you that this is not new to the White House&#8217;s radar.&nbsp; We have been working on this issue since the very beginning, in the days leading up to the recall and ever since then.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, you know, since mid-February, we have been working closely with USDA and FDA on a suite of actions that they have taken, which is why we are able to say today that production today is &#8212; you know, exceeds production in the period just before the recall was &#8212; the recall was initiated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As just some examples of the ongoing work we have been doing: We’ve, throughout this period, been cutting red tape to expedite the import of infant formula for other countries.&nbsp; Since February, we have been working with retailers to impose purchase limits, prevent the possibility of hoarding.&nbsp; Again, we have had ongoing work with other &#8212; with all manufacturers of infant formula to bring product to market, and we have really seen that pay off.&nbsp; And, you know, it is helping to mitigate some of the challenges that we might otherwise be facing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the same time, we absolutely recognize the frustration that American families are feeling right now.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s why the President has acted to direct the administration to pull additional levers and take additional action to make more supply available as quickly as possible.&nbsp; He&#8217;s leading with action, not words.&nbsp; And that’s the package of announcements you&#8217;re seeing today.</p>



<p>MR. MUNOZ:&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; Last question.&nbsp; Let’s go to Kathryn Watson at CBS.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi.&nbsp; Thank you so much for doing this call.&nbsp; If production has reached the levels &#8212; reached or surpassed the levels of where it was before this recall, when can parents expect to see that result on the shelves?&nbsp; How many weeks, days, months are we talking about until the &#8212; you know, that supply is actually felt?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; So, we absolutely recognize the frustration of parents and families.&nbsp; I am expecting my second child in June and, you know, feel this issue very, very acutely.&nbsp; So, you know, this is &#8212; we know that the American people need to see product on the shelves consistently and that this is a critical issue.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why we are announcing this package of actions today to speed things up.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t have a particular timeline for you. &nbsp;But we are &#8212; we are working closely with partners across the federal government to mitigate these shortages and improve experiences for American families as they’re shopping for formula across the country.</p>



<p>MR. MUNOZ:&nbsp; Thanks, [senior administration official], and thanks, [senior administration official].&nbsp; Again, thank you everybody for joining this call.&nbsp; When we get off this, both the contents of the call and the factsheet are lifted.&nbsp; And reach out to me with any questions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thank you.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>3:17 P.M. EDT</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>President Biden has directed his administration to work urgently to ensure that during the Abbott Nutrition voluntary recall, infant formula is safe and available for families across the country. Today, President Biden spoke with retailers and manufacturers, including Wal-Mart, Target, Reckitt, and Gerber, to discuss ways we can all work together to do more to help families access infant formula.</p>



<p>On February 17, the largest infant formula manufacturer in the country—Abbott Nutrition—initiated a voluntary recall of several lines of powdered formula. This came after concerns about bacterial contamination at Abbott’s Sturgis, Michigan, facility after four infants fell ill and two died. The federal government—including the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Department of Agriculture (USDA), Department of Justice (DOJ), Department of Transportation (DOT), U.S. Trade Representative (USTR), Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Department of Commerce (DOC), and the White House—has worked diligently over the last few months to address the shortfall in infant formula production while the Sturgis plant remains offline, including working with other infant formula manufacturers to increase production, expediting the import of infant formula from abroad, and calling on both online and in store retailers to establish purchasing limits to prevent the possibility of hoarding. As a result, more infant formula has been produced in the last four weeks than in the four weeks preceding the recall &#8212; despite one of the largest infant formula production facilities in the U.S. being offline.</p>



<p>Families across the country remain concerned about the availability of infant formula—especially families that depend on specialty formulas for which the Sturgis facility is a key supplier. These 20 specialty formulas are used by about 5,000 infants as well as some older children and adults with rare metabolic diseases, and Abbott Nutrition is the only supplier for some of these formulas.</p>



<p>Today, President Biden is announcing additional steps to bolster our work to get infant formula onto store shelves as quickly as possible without compromising safety. These steps include:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Cutting Red Tape to Get More Infant Formula to Store Shelves Quicker: </strong>Manufacturers typically produce many different sizes of the same type of infant formula. Simplifying product offerings allows manufacturers to increase the speed and scale of their infant formula production, stabilizing the overall volume of formula available in the market. The type of formula that companies make and distribute is impacted by the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), administered by USDA. About half of infant formula nationwide is purchased by participants using WIC benefits, based on both federal requirements and additional rules set by individual states that have a large effect on the availability and distribution of infant formula in a given state.</li></ul>



<p>To help further increase manufacturers’ ability to meet demand and distribute formula, USDA is working with states to make it easier for vulnerable families to purchase the formula they need with their WIC benefits. USDA is urging states to allow WIC recipients to use their WIC benefits on a wider variety of products so that if certain sizes or types of formula are out of stock, they can use their benefits on those that are in stock. And, USDA is urging states to relax their requirements that stores keep a certain amount of formula in stock. This will offer relief to retailers and allow companies to manage inventories to meet demand. Some states are already doing this. All fifty states should. These actions will make it easier for vulnerable families to get the necessary nutritional support for their infants.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Calling on the FTC and State Attorneys General to Crack Down on Any Price Gouging or Unfair Market Practices Related to Sales of Infant Formula: </strong>Parents looking to feed their child should not be taken advantage of by unscrupulous retailers unfairly jacking up prices. There have been <a href="https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/baby-formula-shortage-forces-mothers-to-go-to-the-extreme/2771731/?amp">several</a> <a href="https://www.wtvr.com/news/local-news/baby-formula-shortage-virginia-moms">reports</a> that actors are purchasing formula at retail stores and reselling it online at a markup several times the retail price, especially specialty brands of formula that have experienced the most disruption. These actions not only are costing families hundreds of dollars for formula they need, but drive scarcity on the market. Since February, the FDA has worked with companies, calling on them to issue purchasing limits to help limit such predatory behavior. Many responsible retailers have responded to that call. Now, DOJ is engaging with state attorneys general to encourage them to use their powers to monitor and address price gouging in the infant formula market, and urging them to devote more resources to monitoring predatory behavior in the market for infant formula. And, the President today asked the Federal Trade Commission to use all its available tools to monitor and investigate reports of illegal and predatory conduct.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Increasing the Supply of Formula Through Increased Imports: </strong>The U.S. normally produces 98% percent of the infant formula it consumes, and trading partners in Mexico, Chile, Ireland, and the Netherlands are key sources of imports. But given the production and distribution issues leading to local short supplies of infant formula, the FDA will, in the coming days, announce specific new steps it is taking concerning importing certain infant formula products from abroad.</li></ul>



<p>More information on actions that the FDA announced earlier this week to address the shortage of infant formula can be found <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-takes-important-steps-improve-supply-infant-and-specialty-formula-products">here</a>. The Biden-Harris Administration will continue to monitor the situation and identify other ways it can support the safe and rapid increase in the production and distribution of baby formula.</p>

<p>Congress took an important step today in formally beginning to reconcile the bipartisan competitiveness legislation. As President Biden said this week, fighting inflation is his top economic priority, and the Bipartisan Innovation Act will help us get that done by promoting domestic manufacturing and strengthening our supply chains. There is common ground between the House and Senate bills, and it’s his hope that conferees focus on what they agree on. The Administration continues to provide assistance to the conferees and committees and will work hard to support the conference in delivering a bill that Democrats and Republicans can support.</p>

<p>I have made it clear that tackling inflation is my top domestic priority. So I am pleased to see the Senate take a step forward on my agenda to get inflation under control by confirming my nominees to the Fed. I want to thank the Senate for confirming Jerome Powell, Dr. Lisa Cook, and Dr. Philip Jefferson this week, joining the recent confirmation of Dr. Lael Brainard. The Federal Reserve plays a primary role in fighting inflation, and these well-qualified members of the Board will bring the skill and knowledge needed at this critical time for our economy and families across the country. We still have more work to do to finish filling the Fed Board, which is why I call on the Senate to swiftly confirm Michael Barr, my nominee for Vice Chair for Supervision.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong><em>Maintaining the momentum for pandemic response and Prioritizing Preparedness</em></strong></p>



<p>On May 12, under the leadership of the United States, Belize, Germany, Indonesia, and Senegal, global leaders from across the world’s economies, civil society, and the private sector gathered for the 2<sup>nd</sup> Global COVID-19 Summit.&nbsp; Summit participants made major new policy and financial commitments to make vaccines available to those at highest risk, to expand access to tests and treatments, and to prevent future health crises.&nbsp; These are linked here.&nbsp; Success in these areas is achievable, but it is not inevitable; leaders reinforced the value of whole-of-government and whole-of-society approaches to bring the acute phase of COVID-19 to an end, and the importance of being &nbsp;prepared for future pandemic threats. The Summit was focused on preventing complacency, recognizing the pandemic is not over; protecting the most vulnerable, including the elderly, immunocompromised people, and frontline and health workers; and preventing future health crises, recognizing <em>now </em>is the time to secure political and financial commitment for pandemic preparedness.</p>



<p>The Summit catalyzed bold commitments.&nbsp; Financially, leaders committed to provide nearly $2 billion in new funding – additional to pledges made earlier in 2022.&nbsp; These funds will accelerate access to vaccinations, testing, and treatments, and they will contribute to a new pandemic preparedness and global health security fund housed at the World Bank.&nbsp; Leaders also made robust national commitments to expand and accelerate vaccine coverage, in particular for their at-risk populations; to expand access to testing and treatments; to protect and support the health workforce and increase domestic budgets for health systems strengthening; and to advance health security, including through the new fund.&nbsp;</p>



<p>World leaders identified three major Summit outcomes.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Prioritizing the highest risk populations to save lives.&nbsp; </strong>First, great progress has been made in fighting COVID-19, but the pandemic is not over and the next health crisis can strike at any time – likely while the world is still battling COVID-19.&nbsp; Summit participants committed to double down on their collective efforts to control COVID-19, and we will enhance our focus on the highest risk populations, including the elderly, the immunocompromised, and healthcare and frontline workers – so that SARS-CoV-2 becomes a manageable respiratory pathogen everywhere.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Expanding access to countermeasures– for COVID-19 and future threats. </strong>Second, the pandemic has led to major advances in developing and delivering life-saving vaccines, tests, treatments, personal protective equipment, and other supplies.&nbsp; Participants especially expressed support for the ACT-Accelerator, as the multilateral mechanism deploying these needed supplies. And yet, the pandemic also underscored major longstanding inequities in access to new countermeasures, especially for low- and lower middle-income countries.&nbsp; Summit participants committed to finding sustainable and predictable solutions for early warning systems and to developing a cohesive global roadmap for local and regional access to medical countermeasures, personal protective equipment, and other lifesaving supplies for potentially pandemic diseases, as well as expanding access to manufacturing and research, including the concept of regional hubs for pandemic preparedness and response around the world.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Maintaining the momentum for pandemic response and prioritizing preparedness.&nbsp; </strong>Finally, no country was fully prepared for the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp; As a result, over 6 million people around the world have lost their lives, trillions of dollars have been lost from the global economy, and gains in global health and towards the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have been reversed.&nbsp; Summit participants committed to maintain the political will needed to establish national, regional, and global capacity for health security and pandemic prevention, preparedness, and response, including for training a strong network of experts to ensure readiness for future outbreaks with pandemic potential.&nbsp; They supported the efforts of the G20 and other partners to establish a pandemic preparedness and global health security fund housed at the World Bank, working in close cooperation with WHO, and they committed to support locally-led solutions to expand and protect the health workforce and minimize disruptions to routine and essential health services.</li></ul>



<p><strong><em><u>Vaccinate the World: </u></em></strong><strong><u>Getting Vaccines to the Most Vulnerable</u></strong></p>



<p>Many countries have made great strides toward meeting the 70% global vaccination target set by the World Health Organization. Since the first Summit, the world’s vaccination rate has increased from 33% to nearly 60%, and lower-middle income countries have risen from 13% to over 50%.&nbsp; However, low income countries are struggling, and our strategy must continue to evolve with the virus.&nbsp; The global effort must focus on populations at highest risk of hospitalization and mortality, including the elderly, immunocompromised people, and healthcare and other frontline workers.&nbsp; World leaders must take action, now, to build, coordinate, and finance the national, regional, and global systems and expert networks required to control COVID-19 so that it becomes a manageable respiratory illness – including predictable and equitable access to safe and effective pandemic vaccines for all countries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ten leaders from government and civil society joined this session, which was co-hosted by <strong>His Excellency Abdoulaye Diouf Sarr</strong>, Minister of Health and Social Action, Senegal; <strong>Her Excellency Annalena Baerbock, </strong>Foreign Minister of Germany; and <strong>Her Excellency Samantha Power</strong>, Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development. The speakers re-emphasized the value of safe and effective vaccines for bringing the acute phase of COVID-19 to an end.&nbsp; The speakers discussed new commitments, challenges, and solutions for building the national, regional, and global systems needed to get vaccines to health and frontline workers, the elderly and immunocompromised, and in humanitarian settings.&nbsp; In particular, they discussed new policy commitments to help overcome local barriers to vaccine access and uptake, as well as financial commitments to expand and sustain access, country by country, everywhere in the world.&nbsp; They also discussed commitments to developing, financing, and sustaining systems for producing and supplying vaccines for COVID-19 variants and future health emergencies, including national and regional access to vaccines and predictable access, scaling, and surge supply.&nbsp; Leaders highlighted the need for robust and sustained donor attention to vaccine administration for COVID-19 &nbsp;and a more coordinated, country-by-country approach to getting vaccinations to those most at risk in communities.&nbsp; They also called for [and committed to] developing a cohesive roadmap for local and regional access to vaccines for future variants and pandemics.&nbsp; The session also highlighted bold commitments from governments to get boosters to their populations, launch vaccination campaigns to reach high risk populations and children, and to accelerate vaccination coverage in their domestic populations. Non-governmental leaders also pledged to work toward sustained access to vaccine availability, as well as plans to scale up and provide open-source results of research and development to inform COVID-19 vaccination strategies in low- and lower-middle income countries, including on boosters and mix-and-match vaccination strategies.</p>



<p><strong><em><u>Save Lives Now: </u></em></strong><strong><u>Expanding Access to Tests and Treatments</u></strong><strong><u></u></strong></p>



<p>Ending the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic and ensuring that COVID-19 becomes a treatable respiratory disease will require enhancing predictable and equitable access to rapid testing and to lifesaving treatments.&nbsp; While the COVID-19 pandemic has catalyzed great advances in diagnostic testing and new therapeutics, such as oral antivirals, there is not yet a sustainable supply of these lifesaving interventions nor a sustainable system for targeting these interventions to those facing the highest risk of hospitalization and mortality, including the elderly, immunocompromised people, as well as healthcare and other frontline workers.&nbsp; In addition, access to and provision of oxygen needs to be increased. &nbsp;Moreover, testing and diagnostics is crucial to enable genetic sequencing and to monitor the emergence of new virus variants. This means that world leaders must take actions, now, to solve persistent challenges in the sustainable and scaled production, delivery, and market demand for tests and treatments, by incentivizing market shaping commitments and advancing platforms for advanced purchases of tests and treatments; lowering production costs, facilitating manufacturing of antiviral inputs, including Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients, and developing national plans for testing and treatment.</p>



<p>Eleven leaders from government and civil society joined this session, which was co-hosted <strong>by His Excellency Kevin Bernard, </strong>Minister of Health and Wellness of Belize,and <strong>Her Excellency Svenja&nbsp;Schulze</strong>, Federal&nbsp;Minister&nbsp;for Economic&nbsp;Cooperationand&nbsp;Development of Germany.&nbsp; Speakers acknowledged the work of existing global efforts, such as ACT-Accelerator, and the importance of fully funding them, to enable the delivery of tests and treatment to people who need them. Speakers emphasized the importance of targeting testing and treatment to those at highest risk of hospitalization and death around the world.&nbsp; Specifically, they discussed the need for country strategies and financing to enhance access to molecular diagnostics and rapid tests, as well as treatments, including oral antivirals and oxygen.&nbsp; They committed to work nationally and globally to overcome local barriers and to pilot test-to-treat strategies. While progress is being made with the Medicines Patent Pool, leaders underscored the importance of long-term access and affordable pricing for affordable, safe, effective and quality medications, including antiviral medications, including the need&nbsp; for closer partnerships between producers, generic manufacturers, and regulators.</p>



<p><strong><em><u>Build Better Health Security:</u></em></strong><strong><u> Preventing Future Health Crises</u></strong><strong><u></u></strong></p>



<p>No country in the world was well-prepared for the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp; As a result, the pandemic remains an ongoing global catastrophe that has cost millions of lives, unwound decades of gains in global health and development, and decreased national and regional resilience to shocks.&nbsp; The time is now to create the national, regional, and global capacity needed to prepare for future variants and the next health emergency, which could come at any time. To reduce the world’s vulnerability to future pandemics, the WHO’s Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response and the G20’s High Level Independent Panel made a number of action-oriented recommendations in early 2021, including to establish a new Financial Intermediary Fund (FIF) for pandemic preparedness and global health security.&nbsp; This recommendation has since been amplified by the World Health Organization Director General and Indonesian G20 Presidency, as well as prominent and expert organizations and individuals from around the world.</p>



<p>Eleven leaders from government and civil society joined this session, which was co-hosted by <strong>His Excellency Budi Gunadi Sadikin, </strong>Minister of Health of Indonesia,and by <strong>His Excellency Antony Blinken</strong>, Secretary of State of the United States<strong>. </strong>This session discussed the need for country capacity, sustainable financing, and a strong health workforce to strengthen health security and health systems – for COVID-19 variants and for future health emergencies.&nbsp; Specifically, speakers discussed exciting new financial commitments and momentum, including work in support of the G20’s Finance and Health Taskforce, to establish a new pandemic preparedness and global health security financial intermediary fund at the World Bank in the next few months, in close cooperation with the WHO and other international partners.&nbsp; Speakers also called for the support of initiatives to strengthen global health governance, especially at the WHO, through amendments of the International Health Regulations and a new international instrument on pandemic prevention, preparedness, and response.</p>



<p>Speakers also emphasized new commitments to expand and protect the health workforce, including by increasing training on infection prevention and control and providing personal protective equipment. Speakers also highlighted the need for current and future policy and financial commitments to ensure that every country has the needed capacity to mitigate COVID-19 variants and future health threats and pandemics. Speakers highlighted commitments to expanding and improving laboratory capacities. Speakers also reiterated the need to generate and sustain local and regional access to medical countermeasures and personal protective equipment, including through research and development and by scaling and diversifying local and regional manufacturing globally. Leaders underscored the need to build a strong network of experts to ensure readiness for future outbreaks with pandemic potential. Discussions also highlighted the need for a robust global plan for a timely and seamless transition from ACT-A to future approaches and instruments.</p>
