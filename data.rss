<p>Dear Madam Speaker:&nbsp;(Dear Madam President:)</p>



<p>Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, within 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President publishes in the&nbsp;<em>Federal Register</em>&nbsp;and transmits to the Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the anniversary date.&nbsp;&nbsp;In accordance with this provision, I have sent to the&nbsp;<em>Federal Register</em>&nbsp;for publication the enclosed notice stating that the national emergency with respect to the stabilization of Iraq declared in Executive Order 13303 of May 22, 2003 &#8212; as modified in scope and relied upon for additional steps taken in&nbsp;Executive Order 13290 of March 20, 2003,&nbsp;Executive Order 13315 of August&nbsp;28, 2003, Executive Order 13350 of July 29, 2004,&nbsp;Executive Order 13364 of November 29, 2004, Executive Order 13438 of July 17, 2007, and Executive Order 13668 of May&nbsp;27,&nbsp;2014 &#8212;&nbsp;is&nbsp;to continue in effect beyond May 22, 2022.</p>



<p>Obstacles to the orderly reconstruction of Iraq, the restoration and maintenance of peace and security in the country, and the development of political, administrative, and economic institutions in Iraq continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I have determined that it is&nbsp;necessary to continue the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13303 with respect to the stabilization of Iraq.</p>

<p>On May 11, 2004, pursuant to his authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 <em>et seq</em>.) and the Syria Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration Act of 2003 (Public Law 108-175), the President issued Executive Order 13338, in which he declared a national emergency with respect to the actions of the Government of Syria.&nbsp; The national emergency was modified in scope and relied upon for additional steps taken in Executive Order 13399 of April 25, 2006, Executive Order 13460 of February 13, 2008, Executive Order 13572 of April 29, 2011, Executive Order 13573 of May 18, 2011, Executive Order 13582 of August 17, 2011, Executive Order 13606 of April 22, 2012, and Executive Order 13608 of May 1, 2012.</p>



<p>The President took these actions to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States constituted by the actions of the Government of Syria in supporting terrorism, maintaining its then-existing occupation of Lebanon, pursuing weapons of mass destruction and missile programs, and undermining United States and international efforts with respect to the stabilization and reconstruction of Iraq.</p>



<p>The regime&#8217;s brutality and repression of the Syrian people, who have called for freedom and a representative government, not only endangers the Syrian people themselves, but also generates instability throughout the region.&nbsp; The Syrian regime&#8217;s actions and policies, including with respect to chemical weapons and supporting terrorist organizations, continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.&nbsp; As a result, the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13338, which was expanded in scope in Executive Order 13572, and with respect to which additional steps were taken in Executive Order 13399, Executive Order 13460, Executive Order 13573, Executive Order 13582, Executive Order 13606, and Executive Order 13608, must continue in effect beyond May 11, 2022.&nbsp; Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency declared with respect to the actions of the Government of Syria.</p>



<p>In addition, the United States condemns the brutal violence and human rights violations and abuses of the Assad regime and its Russian and Iranian enablers. &nbsp;The United States calls on the Assad regime, and its backers, to stop its violent war against its own people, enact a nationwide ceasefire, facilitate the unhindered delivery of humanitarian assistance to all Syrians in need, and negotiate a political settlement in Syria in line with United Nations Security Council Resolution 2254.&nbsp; The United States will consider changes in policies and actions of the Government of Syria in determining whether to continue or terminate this national emergency in the future.</p>



<p>This notice shall be published in the <em>Federal Register </em>and transmitted to the Congress.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>Ten days ago, I sent to Congress an urgent proposal to provide needed military, economic, and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine.  The plan was substantial in size, because the need is substantial:  we must stand by Ukraine as it defends itself from Russian aggression.<br> <br>The need is also urgent: I have nearly exhausted the resources given to me by a bipartisan majority in Congress to support Ukraine’s fighters.  This aid has been critical to Ukraine’s success on the battlefield.  We cannot allow our shipments of assistance to stop while we await further Congressional action.  We are approximately ten days from hitting this critical deadline. <br> <br>I am pleased that, in my conversations with Congressional leaders, there appears to be strong support for the proposal I submitted, and Congress is likely to pass it in substantially the form I proposed.  I urge them to do so, and again, I urge them to do so quickly. <br> <br>Previously, I had recommended that Congress take overdue action on much needed funding for COVID treatments, vaccines and tests, as part of the Ukraine Supplemental bill.  However, I have been informed by Congressional leaders in both parties that such an addition would slow down action on the urgently needed Ukrainian aid – a view expressed strongly by several Congressional Republicans.  We cannot afford delay in this vital war effort.  Hence, I am prepared to accept that these two measures move separately, so that the Ukrainian aid bill can get to my desk right away.<br> <br>However let me be clear:  as vital as it is to help Ukraine combat Russian aggression, it is equally vital to help Americans combat COVID.  Without timely COVID funding, more Americans will die needlessly.  We will lose our place in line for America to order new COVID treatments and vaccines for the fall, including next-generation vaccines under development, and be unable to maintain our supply of COVID tests.  In the fall, if we are hit by new variants, it will be too late to get the tools needed for protection – critical treatments that will be available in Europe, but not the United States.  In addition, our effort to help lower-income countries get COVID vaccines into arms will stall. <br> <br>So I call on Congress to pass the Ukrainian Supplemental funding bill immediately, and get it to my desk in the next few days.  And then, I urge Congress to move promptly on the COVID funding bill.  This virus knows no borders; we must continue to save lives here at home and around the world.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Oval Office</p>



<p>3:08 P.M. EDT</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Well, welcome, folks.&nbsp; Today I’m joined by Senator Cardin &#8212; Ben Cardin; Elissa Slotkin; and the Congresswoman Victoria Spatz &#8212; Spartz, excuse me, who &#8212; I was just talking to her about still having family back in Ukraine.&nbsp; God love you.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I &#8212; we’re going to &#8212; I’m about to sign a bill that these folks are responsible &#8212; and, of course, the Vice President, excuse me.&nbsp; Excuse me.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The &#8212; I’m signing a bill that provides another important tool in our efforts to support the government of Ukraine and the Ukrainian people in their fight to defend their country and their democracy against Putin’s brutal war.&nbsp; And it is brutal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I want to thank members of Congress here for getting this passed and everyone who supported the bill.&nbsp; And the bill demonstrates that support for Ukraine is pivotal at this moment.</p>



<p>Every day, Ukrainians pay with their lives, and they fight along &#8212; and the atrocities that the Russians are engaging in are just beyond the pale.&nbsp; And the cost of the fight is not cheap, but caving to aggression is even more costly.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re staying in this.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yesterday, we celebrated VE Day &#8212; Victory in Europe Day &#8212; marking the end of a transition of the devastation as a consequence of World War Two and Allied nations’ defeat of the scourge of fascism in Europe.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>And today, Europe is honoring another important day on the anniversary.&nbsp; On May 9th, 1950, just years after the end of World War Two, Europe began to work to strengthen the bonds of unity among the nations, particularly the economic unity and the shared economic prosperity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The idea ultimately grew into the &#8212; what is now a 27-nation European Union &#8212; an economic powerhouse and a global force for peace and close partners of all &#8212; on all the issues we face.</p>



<p>And it really has &#8212; I&#8217;ve said from the very beginning: It&#8217;s &#8212; it’s something that is good for everyone.&nbsp; It brings these countries together in ways that &#8212; and they cooperate closely economically.&nbsp; They also cooperate in other ways.&nbsp; And you’ve seen it in their support for Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And with Putin’s war once more bringing wanton destruction into Europe, and to &#8212; to reaffirm the enduring commitment to the future grounded in democracy, human rights, and peaceful resolution to disagreements, I&#8217;m now going to sign this bill.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>And again, I thank my colleagues who are standing behind me.&nbsp; And &#8212; because it really matters.&nbsp; It matters.&nbsp;</p>



<p>(The bill is signed.)</p>



<p>There you go.  Done.  Thank you.  (Applause.)</p>

EDT<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Hello, everyone.&nbsp; Welcome to the sunny Rose Garden.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Thank you, thank you, thank you.<br><br>That old saying, “All that needs to be said has already been said, but I’m going to say it again.”&nbsp; (Laughter.)<br><br>Look, Alisha, thank you very much for your story.<br><br>And I wanted to &#8212; I want to thank the Vice President, Vice President Harris, for leading this effort and this administration on this issue.&nbsp;<br><br>And I’m proud to announce today that our administration has brought together Democrats, Republicans, the private sector to lower the high-speed Internet costs for tens of millions of Americans.<br><br>You know, but before we get into the details, I want to talk about why this matters.&nbsp; You already know that, actually, from hearing my two colleagues speak before me.<br><br>But here in the United States of America, how many times have you seen a mom or a dad drive up to a parking lot outside a McDonald’s and &#8212; just so they could get connected to the Internet so their kid could do their homework during the pandemic, literally?&nbsp; It’s just not right.&nbsp; It’s not who we are.<br><br>And we saw, during the pandemic, how essential high-speed Internet really is in allowing seniors to connect with their doctors through telemedicine, as the Vice President referenced, when it wasn’t safe to go in person; allowing students to keep learning back when schools were closed; allowing millions of &#8212; millions workers to do their job remotely; allowing small businesses to stay afloat on the strength of their online sales; allowing farmers to use precision agriculture technology to improve their yields; and allowing countless families to stay connected to the people they love, even when they weren’t able to get together.&nbsp;<br><br>You know, the need for high-speed Internet is &#8212; is a little bit like what used to be probably what my grandfather talked about: needing to have a telephone.&nbsp; It’s pretty consequential.&nbsp; And it’s only going to keep growing, this need.&nbsp; High-speed Internet is not a luxury any longer, it’s a necessity.&nbsp;<br><br>And that’s why the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law included $65 billion to make sure we expand access to broadband Internet in every region of the country &#8212; urban, suburban, and rural &#8212; everywhere &#8212; everywhere &#8212; (applause) &#8212; so every household in America can get connected.<br><br>By &#8212; by expanding access it’s only &#8212; it’s only part of the challenge, though, as was referenced by the Vice President.&nbsp; It was about affordability as well.&nbsp; And today, too many families simply can’t afford to get connected, even if there’s access to get connected.&nbsp; So they go without high-speed Internet or they sacrifice other necessities in order to make it work.&nbsp;<br><br>That’s why &#8212; that’s why, in November, when we passed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill, we also created something called the Affordable Connectivity Program.&nbsp; I refuse to call it the “ACP.”&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; I am so tired of acronyms in Washington.&nbsp; I can’t stand it.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; I cannot stand it.&nbsp; But I’m going to have to learn, aren’t I?&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;<br><br>Here’s how it works: If your household income is twice the federal poverty level or less &#8212; that’s about $55,000 per year for a family of four or $27,000 for an individual &#8212; or a member of your household is on Medicaid or Supplemental Security Income or a number of other programs, you’re eligible to &#8212; for affordably connect &#8212; the Affordable Connectivity Program.&nbsp;<br><br>Nearly 40 percent of the households in America qualify.&nbsp; And if you qualify, you’re going to get a $30 credit per month toward your Internet bill, which me- &#8212; which most folks &#8212; will mean they get on for nothing.&nbsp; Look &#8212; zero.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Let me explain: In the past, 30 bucks a month meant you had to settle for a slow Internet service, unless you wanted to pay a heck of a lot more out of pocket.&nbsp; But over the last few months, my administration has worked closely with Internet providers &#8212; this is a case where big business stepped up &#8212; urging them to cut their prices and raise their &#8212; their speeds.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I’m trying to get others to do the same thing with inflation but that &#8212; these guys are the best.&nbsp; (Laughter.)</p>



<p>Well, look, we secured commitments from 20 providers &#8212; most of whom are here in the garden today.&nbsp; Going to lower prices for high-speed Internet for tens of millions of households.&nbsp; So, now families who are eligible can select a plan from pr- &#8212; a participating provider and receive high-speed Internet at no cost, in most cases.<br><br>These include providers like AT&amp;T.&nbsp; Is AT&amp;T here?&nbsp; Thank you, man.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>AT&amp;T, Comcast &#8212; Comcast, where are you?&nbsp; Stand up, man.&nbsp; Let them see you.&nbsp; Frontier, Spectrum, and Verizon.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Thank you, thank you, thank you.&nbsp;&nbsp;You’re really changing people’s lives.&nbsp; You really are.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Along with smaller providers serving rural areas, like Jackson Energy Authority in Tennessee and Ideatek in Kansas.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Are you guys here?&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Thank you, thank you, thank you.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>All told, providers taking part &#8212; you know, everybody &#8212; it’s &#8212; you’re going to cover about 80 percent of the United States’ population, including about half the rural population.&nbsp; Each of the &#8212; each of them has committed to offering families who use this program at least one high-speed plan that is fully covered.&nbsp;<br><br>For example, Verizon lowered the price of its high-speed service from $40 a month to $30 a month.&nbsp; Spectrum doubled the speed of its $30-a-month plan for eligible households.&nbsp; And we made sure that there would be no hidden fees, no tricks.&nbsp; This is straight stuff.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>This means fast Internet, good download speeds, with no data caps and no extra fees for millions of American families.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>And it’s going to change people’s lives.&nbsp; You know, in &#8212; from rural Appalachia to Brooklyn to the Black Belt.&nbsp; Families who have struggled to get the Internet that they need &#8212; even getting &#8212; finding if they could connect to it, let alone if they could afford it &#8212; for schoolwork, telemedicine, standing a &#8212; starting a business, and so much more &#8212; and will finally get connected reliably and affordably.<br><br>And I want to thank the companies who are working with us to deliver this for all families.&nbsp; It’s a big deal.&nbsp; And this is a great example of what we can achieve if the federal government and the private sector work together to solve serious problems.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>And this is &#8212; not only is it this great news for family budgets, it also means more jobs, more new small businesses, more connectivity.&nbsp; So many people in so many communities that have been left behind.&nbsp; Already, more than 11.5 million have signed up and are on the program.&nbsp; Thousands more are signing up each day.&nbsp; And you can get started by taking advantage of this &#8212; in this new phase today.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>They’re &#8212; but we urge &#8212; there’s about 30 million additional people who are eligible for this plan that basically get free Internet and good Internet.&nbsp; We want each of you &#8212; each and every one of you to take advantage of the chance and cut your Internet cost.</p>



<p>To find out if you’re eligible, you can dial 877-384-2575.&nbsp; Now, if you got that, you’re way ahead of me.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; 877-384-2575, and &#8212; for English or Spanish.</p>



<p>Or if you’re able to get onto the Internet, just visit, Get- &#8212; just go to GetInternet.gov, and you’ll be able to connect as well.<br><br>You know, we’re also working with local, state, and federal agencies, as well as local and national organizations, to help get more eligible families enrolled so they can get connected.&nbsp; You got to know how to know, as a friend of mine used to say.&nbsp; You know, this program is a big deal.&nbsp; It’s the only one &#8212; only one piece of work that we’re doing to try to bring down the cost of high-speed Internet to every single American.&nbsp;<br><br>We’re also promoting the &#8212; competition.&nbsp; More than 65 million Americans live in a place with only one high-speed Internet provider.&nbsp; Research shows that when you live somewhere with limited Internet options, you pay five times more on average than families that have more choices.&nbsp; That’s what the lack of cont- &#8212; lack of competition does: It raises the prices you pay.&nbsp; So, we’re working to fix that problem as well.<br><br>For example, my administration is taking steps to put a stop to the exclusive deals that landlords make with Internet companies.&nbsp; Because [of] those sweetheart arrangements, millions of Americans who live in apartment buildings only have one Internet option.&nbsp; And they &#8212; they can stop &#8212; if they can stop those exclusive deals, then families will have options to choose a provider that they want, and that means companies will have to compete for their business, which in turn means lower prices.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>In addition, more than 30 million Americans live in places where the speeds are too slow or where there is no broadband and there&#8217;s no infrastructure at all.&nbsp; That’s especially true in rural communities.&nbsp; And as I said at the start: Thanks to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, we’re delivering high-speed Internet infrastructure to every part of the country.&nbsp; And I mean that literally &#8212; every part of the country.&nbsp;<br><br>The bottom line is this: My top priority is fighting inflation and lowering prices for families and the things they need.&nbsp; Today’s announcement is going to give millions of families a little more &#8212; a little more breathing room to help them pay their bills.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>You know, we worked with Democrats and Republicans and business and non-profits to make this happen.&nbsp; And we’re going to keep working to fight inflation and lower cost of &#8212; to all American families for a lot of other things as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>But again, I want to thank the businesses that are here today.&nbsp; I want to thank the Internet companies &#8212; or the providers.&nbsp; It really matters.&nbsp; You&#8217;re going to change people’s lives.&nbsp;<br><br>And, by the way, you know, one of the things that is &#8212; it’s a totally different subject, and I&#8217;m just going to touch it for a second.&nbsp; There&#8217;s an awful lot of growing data that what&#8217;s happened because of COVID and other things &#8212; the mental health problems are &#8212; have become a serious problem.&nbsp; Feeling left out, feeling you can&#8217;t participate, not knowing what to do.<br><br>I know &#8212; and Vivek Murthy, the Surgeon General, is going to talk about this in another context.&nbsp; But, you know, I really think that just knowing that you belong, knowing and feeling that you can get access to what other people get on a regular basis will make a big difference for people.&nbsp;<br><br>So, God bless you all.&nbsp; And may God protect our troops.&nbsp; And all the members of Congress who made this happy &#8212; I was going to name each one of you, and I was told don’t, because people who aren’t here wanted to be here.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; But I &#8212; but I think I should name you anyway, shouldn’t I?&nbsp; I mean &#8212; no?&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Well, I don&#8217;t know, man.&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway.&nbsp; (Laughter.)<br><br>They’re all in the front here, and they&#8217;re all doing a hell of a job.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br><br>I started off – and I had the list, I said, “Give me the…”&nbsp; And I started off with saying, “Cheri Bustos.”&nbsp; And they said, “Wait, there&#8217;s a lot of people who aren’t here.&nbsp; Don’t do it.”&nbsp; Anyway.&nbsp; But I &#8212; and the people who are here are, you know,&nbsp;John Hickenlooper, Cheri Bustos, Dan Kildee &#8212; (laughter) &#8212; Debbie Dingell, Tom O’Halleran, Eliza [sic] Slotkin &#8212; excuse me, Elissa Slotkin, and &#8212; and Representative Stansbury.&nbsp; So &#8212; but there&#8217;s a lot more to it, but anyway.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br><br>Thank you.&nbsp; It’s going to make a big difference.&nbsp; Thank you, everybody.&nbsp; And stick around and sunbathe.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; All right.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>2:00 P.M. EDT</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Biden-Harris Administration Secures Commitments from 20 Internet Providers to Cut Prices and Increase Speeds</em></p>



<p>High-speed internet service is no longer a luxury—it’s a necessity. But too many families go without high-speed internet because of the cost or have to cut back on other essentials to make their monthly internet service payments. Lowering prices—including the cost of high-speed internet service—is President Biden’s top priority. Today, President Biden and Vice President Harris are announcing that they have secured private sector commitments that will lower high-speed internet costs for millions of American families.</p>



<p>As part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the President and Vice President worked with Democrats and Republicans to create the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP), which allows tens of millions of American households to reduce their internet service costs by up to $30/month (or $75/month on Tribal lands). To ensure the most efficient use of those public dollars and to deliver maximum cost savings to families, the Biden-Harris Administration has secured commitments from 20 leading internet providers—covering more than 80% of the U.S. population across urban, suburban, and rural areas—to either increase speeds or cut prices, making sure they all offer ACP-eligible households high-speed, high-quality internet plans for no more than $30/month.</p>



<p>From large providers like AT&amp;T, Comcast, and Verizon serving dozens of states, to smaller providers serving rural areas like Jackson Energy Authority in Tennessee and Comporium in North Carolina, the commitments will allow tens of millions of ACP-eligible households to receive high-speed internet at no cost.</p>



<p>The Biden-Harris Administration is also launching a comprehensive effort to make sure as many ACP-eligible households as possible take advantage of this new program by:</p>



<ul><li><strong><u>Launching GetInternet.gov:</u></strong> <a href="http://www.GetInternet.gov">GetInternet.gov</a> is a simple, easy-to-use website with details on how Americans can sign up for ACP and find participating internet providers in their area.<br></li><li><strong><u>Reaching out to eligible households through federal agencies:</u></strong> Households qualify for ACP based on their income or through their participation in one of several other federal programs, like Pell Grants, Medicaid, or Supplemental Security Income. Agencies that manage these programs will be coordinating an effort to reach out to households that qualify for ACP through programs they help administer.&nbsp;For example, the Social Security Administration will email all 1.6 million Supplemental Security Income recipients who have a “My Social Security” account, letting them know that they are eligible for the Affordable Connectivity Program.<br></li><li><strong><u>Partnering with states and cities:</u></strong> The Administration is partnering with states and cities to spread the word as well. For example, Michigan, Massachusetts, Philadelphia, Mesa, Arizona, and New York City will text millions of eligible households.<br></li><li><strong><u>Collaborating with public interest organizations:</u></strong> Public interest organizations, including the United Way, Goodwill, Catholic Charities USA, and UnidosUS, will train their national networks to conduct direct enrollment and outreach. And Propel, a mission-driven financial technology company, will provide information via the Providers app to connect more than 5 million low-income families with the program.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Today’s announcement is just one part of the President’s strategy for lowering the cost of high-speed internet for all Americans. New <a href="https://www.ntia.doc.gov/category/grants">grant</a> <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/coronavirus/assistance-for-state-local-and-tribal-governments/capital-projects-fund#:~:text=The%20American%20Rescue%20Plan%20provides,to%20the%20public%20health%20emergency.">programs</a> <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/coronavirus/assistance-for-state-local-and-tribal-governments/state-and-local-fiscal-recovery-funds">providing</a> tens of billions of dollars for broadband infrastructure construction will require providers to offer affordable internet options. New rules will soon require providers to display a “<a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-acts-empower-broadband-consumers-through-transparency-0">Broadband Nutrition Label</a>” that will make it easier to comparison shop for the best deal on internet. The FCC has adopted rules to ban sweetheart deals between internet providers and landlords that restrict the internet options available to millions of Americans who live <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-acts-increase-broadband-competition-apartment-buildings-0">in apartment buildings</a>. And the President’s <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/competition/">competition agenda</a> is focused on providing Americans with more good options for internet service where they live—driving down prices and increasing the quality of service.<br><br><strong><u>THE AFFORDABLE CONNECTIVITY PROGRAM (ACP)</u></strong><br>President Biden and Vice President Harris worked with Democrats and Republicans to create the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP)—the largest high-speed internet affordability program in our nation’s history. Experts estimate that <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/610831a16c95260dbd68934a/t/6272e30e12eafe18e06dec58/1651696399310/Broadband-Connectivity-Fact-Sheet-CPSP-2022.pdf">48 million households</a>—or nearly 40% of households in the country—qualify for the ACP either because their income is at or below 200% of the Federal Poverty Level, or because a member of the household meets one of the other criteria below:</p>



<ul><li>Participates in one of the following programs:<ul><li>Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), formerly known as Food Stamps</li><li>Medicaid</li><li>Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC)</li><li>Supplemental Security Income (SSI)</li><li>Federal Public Housing Assistance (FPHA)</li><li>Veterans Pension and Survivors Benefit</li><li>Free and Reduced-Price School Lunch Program or School Breakfast Program, including at U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Community Eligibility Provision schools</li><li>Federal Pell Grant (received in the current award year)</li><li>Lifeline</li><li>Certain Tribal assistance programs, including Bureau of Indian Affairs General Assistance, Head Start (only households meeting the income qualifying standard), Tribal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (Tribal TANF), and Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations<br></li></ul></li><li>Meets the eligibility criteria for a participating broadband provider’s existing low-income internet program.</li></ul>



<p>Under the terms of the ACP, an eligible household that signs up for the program will receive a discount of up to $30/month on any internet service plan a participating provider offers. Households on Tribal Lands are eligible for a discount of up to $75/month. As of now, more than 1,300 internet service providers participate in the program, and more than 11.5 million households have signed up to receive the ACP benefit.<br><br><strong><u>NEW PRIVATE SECTOR COMMITMENTS</u></strong><br>To make the most of this program, the Biden-Harris Administration asked participating internet service providers to either reduce prices and or raise speeds to offer ACP-eligible households a high-speed internet plan for no more than $30/month. For these purposes, the Administration views a sufficiently high-speed plan as one that offers download speeds of at least 100 Megabits per second everywhere that the provider’s infrastructure is capable of it. That’s fast enough for a typical family of four to work from home, do schoolwork, browse the web, and stream high-definition shows and movies. In addition, the Administration asked providers to offer such plans with no fees and no data caps.</p>



<p>For example, as part of this initiative, Verizon lowered the price for its Fios service from $39.99/month to $30/month for a plan that delivers download and upload speeds of at least 200 Megabits per second, and Spectrum doubled the speed of the $30/month plan it makes available to ACP participants from 50 to 100 Megabits per second (download).</p>



<p>Each of the following companies committed to offer all ACP-eligible families at least one high-speed plan for $30/month or less, with no additional fees and no data caps.</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://www.allocommunications.com/community-connect-residential/">Allo Communications</a></li><li><a href="https://info.cincinnatibell.com/acp">AltaFiber</a> (and <a href="https://hawaiiantel.com/acp">Hawaiian Telecom</a>)</li><li>Altice USA (<a href="https://www.optimum.com/affordable-connectivity-program">Optimum</a> and <a href="https://www.suddenlink.com/affordable-connectivity-program">Suddenlink</a>)</li><li><a href="https://www.astound.com/acp">Astound</a></li><li><a href="http://www.att.com/acp">AT&amp;T</a></li><li><a href="https://www.breezeline.com/acp">Breezeline</a></li><li><a href="https://www.internetessentials.com/">Comcast</a></li><li><a href="https://www.comporium.com/affordable-connectivity-program-connected-package/">Comporium</a></li><li><a href="https://www.getfrontierfiber.com/acp-offer#3UP">Frontier</a></li><li><a href="https://ideatek.com/low-income-assistance/">IdeaTek</a></li><li><a href="https://www.cox.com/residential/internet/low-cost-internet-plans.html">Cox Communications</a></li><li><a href="http://www.eplusbroadband.com/acp">Jackson Energy Authority</a></li><li>Mediacom </li><li><a href="https://mlgc.com/acp/">MLGC</a></li><li><a href="https://www.spectrum.com/cp/broadband-get-qualified?p1=1-877-958-7103&amp;opredirect=acp">Spectrum</a> (Charter Communications</li><li><a href="https://starry.com/acp/">Starry</a></li><li><a href="https://www.verizon.com/home/fios-forward">Verizon</a> (Fios only)</li><li><a href="https://www.vermontel.com/acp">Vermont Telephone Company</a></li><li><a href="http://www.vexusfiber.com/acp">Vexus Fiber</a></li><li><a href="https://www.wowway.com/affordable-connectivity-program">Wow!</a> Internet, Cable, and TV</li></ul>



<p>These companies serve urban, suburban, and rural communities across the country. Collectively, they offer high-speed internet services in areas in which over 80% of the U.S. population lives, including nearly 50% of the rural population. The Biden-Harris Administration is grateful for the efforts of these companies, and encourages additional internet service providers to join this effort to close the digital divide by offering high-speed, low-cost plans.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Via Teleconference</p>



<p>7:21 A.M. EDT<br>&nbsp;<br>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; And thanks everyone for joining us.&nbsp; I know it’s pretty early on a Sunday morning.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So we’re going to turn it over to [senior administration official] who is going to be our speaker for your awareness.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>But this call is on background, and it’s attributable to a “senior administration official.”&nbsp; The contents of this call are going to be embargoed until 12:00 p.m. today.<br>&nbsp;<br>So with that, I’m going to turn it over to [senior administration official] to give some remarks, and then we’ll take some questions.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Over to you, [senior administration official].<br>&nbsp;<br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Thanks, [moderator].&nbsp; Good morning.&nbsp; Thanks, everybody, as well for joining early.&nbsp; And Happy Mother’s Day.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Our sanctions design from the start has been predicated on applying economic pressure where we have an asymmetric advantage, where we and our allies produce something Russia needs and can’t easily get from anywhere else.&nbsp; And in doing so, we strengthen Ukraine’s position on the battlefield and at the negotiating table.&nbsp; That was the premise for cutting off Russia from the leading financial centers of the world &#8212; New York, London, Tokyo, Switzerland, Singapore.&nbsp; The oxygen of any market-based economy is financial capital, and that’s been deprived for &#8212; that’s been taken away from Russia.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>That’s why we’ve denied critical technology inputs and investment capital Putin needs to replenish his weaponry and diversify growth away from just oil and gas.&nbsp; That’s why we’ve denied access to critical markets that Putin needs to sell his goods.&nbsp; No export is more important to Putin than oil; it’s the main artery of his economy.&nbsp; And the EU is now on the cusp of joining the U.S., Canada, and the UK in cutting off this trade.<br>&nbsp;<br>And the same logic applies to the services ban we are announcing today.&nbsp; Russia has long relied on services provided by G7 countries to operate a modern economy, especially services provided by the United States and the United Kingdom, which are the dominant service providers in the world.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So today we’re banning the provision of accounting services, management consulting, marketing &#8212; all services that are used to operate multinational businesses, but also to potentially create workarounds from sanctions or to hide ill-gotten wealth.&nbsp; That’s why we’re shutting down these services.<br>&nbsp;<br>We’re also announcing today that U.S. advertising dollars, broadcast technology, video cameras, microphones, equipment for sound will no longer be available to the three most watched state-owned or -controlled Russian TV stations that enable Putin’s propaganda machine.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Some of you have reported on the lies upon lies that are spread on these mouthpieces of the Kremlin, such as claiming the people of Bucha were not killed until days after Russians left the region, or that the placement of dead Ukrainian bodies was staged, or that the brave Ukrainians defending their country are actually the aggressors.<br>&nbsp;<br>After today, no U.S. company can be in the business of funding or supporting the disinformation machine that masks the truth of Putin’s barbaric invasion behind lies and deceit.<br>&nbsp;<br>We’re also adding to our export controls and sanctions that directly degrade Russia’s war efforts, including controls on industrial engines and bulldozers.&nbsp; The EU is moving in tandem with additional controls on chemicals, for example, that feed directly into Russia’s military industrial complex.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>These new controls will further limit Russia’s access to components that it needs to replenish and restock its military capabilities.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>As a result of our export controls applied to date, Russia’s two major tank plants, the Uralz- &#8212; I’m going to mispronounce these &#8212; the Uralvagonzavod Corporation and the Chelyabinsk Tractor Plant have halted work due to the lack of foreign components.&nbsp; Russian companies that operate heavy machinery made by Caterpillar or John Deere are reporting halts in their production or significant disruptions.&nbsp; Boeing has halted major operations in Russia and ended all exports of spare parts to Russian airlines, as has Airbus.<br>&nbsp;<br>The last thing we’re doing today is we’re adding 2,600 visa restrictions in response to ongoing human rights violations and atrocities committed by Russian military officials and Belarusian officials, and we’re sanctioning more bank executives from the largest bank in Russia, Sberbank, as well as the third-largest bank, Gazprombank.&nbsp; The latter of which we have not previously touched with sanctions.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Taken together, today’s actions are a continuation of the systematic and methodical removal of Russia from the global financial and economic system.&nbsp; And the message is: There will be no safe havens in the Russian economy if Putin’s invasion continues.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Happy to take your questions.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Could we please queue up the directions to ask the questions?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; Thank you so much for doing this.&nbsp; Good morning.&nbsp; And, yes, Happy Mother&#8217;s Day.&nbsp; [Senior administration official], can you just give a little more on this?&nbsp; You mentioned they were bulldozers &#8212; these are export controls.&nbsp; Can you dive a little bit more into that?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And can you update us on what you&#8217;re seeing in terms of Russian efforts to evade or circumvent?&nbsp; Is this continuing to be a problem?&nbsp; Is clamping down part of the discussion for the G7?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And finally, on services, does consulting services count?&nbsp; A lot of these major Russian companies &#8212; oligarchs &#8212; have consultants across the U.S.&nbsp; Is that being halted as well?&nbsp; Thank you.<br>&nbsp;<br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Yeah, thanks, Josh.&nbsp; So first, on the export controls: I mentioned bulldozers, but also industrial engines.&nbsp; And these are all &#8212; these are all asymmetries.&nbsp; So we supply components that Russia needs to feed its military industrial complex.&nbsp; I would add chemicals, auto parts.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>These are &#8212; we started out with foundational technology inputs.&nbsp; So, you know, we placed a lot of focus on Western microchips and the impact that&#8217;s having on precision-guided missiles.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And we&#8217;re moving &#8212; we&#8217;re broadening into industrial products that have a similar effect, we think, on Putin&#8217;s ability to prosecute his war ambitions.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s why we&#8217;ve added these products.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And it&#8217;s really a powerful combination because while Europe certainly has the bulk of the traded goods relationship with Russia, we do too.&nbsp; And now that we&#8217;ve added services, you can think of these as working in tandem.&nbsp; Europe has the bulk of the goods relationship with Russia.&nbsp; The U.S. and the UK have historically provided most of the services from the West to Russia, and we&#8217;re cutting both off.&nbsp; And they should mutually reinforce each other.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Your second question was on Russia&#8217;s efforts to evade or circumvent sanctions, and I am not hearing of any success Russia is having in supplying these parts from anywhere else.&nbsp; I mean, we mapped this out pretty carefully beforehand, in terms of our export controls and especially on technologies.&nbsp; And we picked &#8212; we picked goods, we picked services, we picked technologies that we and the Europeans and the G7 and our partners in Asia were the dominant suppliers of.&nbsp; And we don&#8217;t think Russia has many options other than to try to produce these goods or services domestically, which I think would be a very tall task.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Lastly, your question on management consulting: Yes, that is within the scope of these of this services ban.&nbsp; We know that these management consulting firms have tended to provide their services to the largest companies in Russia, often state-owned enterprises under the control of the Kremlin.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The same is true of the big four accountants.&nbsp; They employ over 10,000 people in Russia.&nbsp; And they&#8217;ve &#8212; together, the accountants and the management consultants, they&#8217;ve been asked, we think, by Russian companies to help them figure out how to reformulate their business strategies in the wake of sanctions &#8212; in some cases, how to get around these sanctions or, in the case of accountants, how to hide some of their wealth.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re shutting that &#8212; we&#8217;re shutting that down.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Good morning.&nbsp; I have two questions.&nbsp; One is: I don&#8217;t see lawyers or legal services on this list, and I want to ask, why?&nbsp; Because American lawyers historically have been valuable to Russian businesspeople in hiding their money and making investments.&nbsp; Why aren&#8217;t they on the list?<br>&nbsp;<br>Second, could you speak a little bit about the problem of blowback of these and other sanctions on the Western economy?<br>&nbsp;<br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Yes, David, you&#8217;re right; legal services are not on the list.&nbsp; And we made a judgment, at least for now, that if there was a desire to seek due process through a U.S. lawyer, we would allow that to continue.&nbsp; But we&#8217;re reevaluating, you know, the breadth of these services, sanctions every day.&nbsp; And depending on how we see behavior change over time, we can certainly broaden the sanctions.<br>&nbsp;<br>The UK has also not banned legal services at this point either, but we&#8217;re closely talking.&nbsp; We&#8217;re talking very actively about whether we ought to broaden.&nbsp; And so, we&#8217;ll just watch what happens in the aftermath of this ban.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>In terms of the spillovers, David, we&#8217;re focused, as you know, on the three main spillovers from Putin&#8217;s invasion: energy &#8212; energy being the most important to the developed world, but also food insecurity, which is, I think, the dominant concern across much of the developing world.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re doing all we can on both fronts.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>I&#8217;ll start with food.&nbsp; You know all of the statistics: 30 percent of the world&#8217;s wheat exports come from Ukraine and Russia, 20 percent of corn, 80 percent of sunflower oil, and about one sixth of fertilizer.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s having a global impact.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>What can we do about it?&nbsp; Well, we&#8217;re speaking out as loudly as we can that this is not the time for countries to have export bans on their food exports.&nbsp; For countries that have spare production capacity and food, they should produce more.&nbsp; For countries that have stockpiles of food, they should release those stockpiles to the countries most in need.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And the international financial institutions, the IMF and the World Bank, they can provide a targeted support to countries that have the most acute food insecurity problems.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s really important to prevent balance of payments issues as this invasion &#8212; if this invasion continues.<br>&nbsp;<br>On energy, there&#8217;s a lot to say.&nbsp; We are &#8212; you know, we&#8217;re taking action together on Putin’s main export source, which is oil &#8212; and gas to a lesser extent &#8212; because that helps to fund his war machine.&nbsp; It&#8217;s the main source of relevance from the Russian economy to the rest of the world. &nbsp;We want to downgrade his status as a leading energy supplier.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>But we want to do that while maintaining global energy supplies at a steady level.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why we&#8217;ve released over 200 million barrels from a strategic reserves.&nbsp; We&#8217;re encouraging domestic producers to respond to price signals and get together with Wall Street and see this as a moment for securing America&#8217;s energy independence.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And, you know, we can certainly surge natural gas supplies to Europe as much as we can.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re also working with partners in Qatar and Australia to add more natural gas supply to Europe, because that&#8217;s the key pressure point on the continent.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And this is going to be an ongoing effort; it&#8217;s not going to be easy.&nbsp; We have to do all of this, of course, while we&#8217;re ceding our transition towards cleaner and more reliable energy sources.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re &#8212; you know, the President, you’ve heard him say he wants to double down, triple down, quadruple down on that transition.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks very much for doing this.&nbsp; Two questions.&nbsp; First, you mentioned that this was the first time you&#8217;ve gone after Gazprombank which, as you noted, was the number three bank.&nbsp; I assume that was because of the overall European sensitivity about going after gas and Gazprom.&nbsp; But tell us a little bit about what changed your mind there, and what changed the Europeans’ minds?<br>&nbsp;<br>And second: How clear have you been to the Russians about exactly what they would need to do to get sanctions removed?&nbsp; Because since we&#8217;ve &#8212; it sounds like we&#8217;ve had a couple of different standards set for what the ultimate U.S. objective here is.&nbsp; And, of course, sanctions wouldn&#8217;t come off all at one time.&nbsp; But I&#8217;m just wondering what kind of clarity you have delivered to the Russians about what exactly they need to do to reverse this?<br>&nbsp;<br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Thanks, David.&nbsp; On the first question, just to clarify: We are not sanctioning Gazprombank, in the same way that we did with SpareBank or VTB or any of the other largest banks.&nbsp; This is not a full block.&nbsp; We&#8217;re not freezing the assets of Gazprombank or prohibiting any transactions with Gazprombank.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>What we&#8217;re signaling is that Gazprombank is not a safe haven, and so we&#8217;re sanctioning some of their top business executives &#8212; they&#8217;re the people who sit at the top of the organization &#8212; to create a chilling effect.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And you&#8217;re right that Gazprombank is the main way in which Russia sells gas to Europe, and so that&#8217;s why we&#8217;ve been cautious about shutting down its operations while Europe is still importing gas from Russia.&nbsp; But we don&#8217;t want Gazprombank to be seen as a safe haven, and that&#8217;s why we&#8217;ve taken action against its top &#8212; his top &#8212; its top people.<br>&nbsp;<br>With respect to rollback, a few things: One, we would never do a deal on sanctions rollback without Ukraine at the head of the table.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The second, if we get to the point at which this is being discussed, it really would depend on the overall shape and scope of the diplomatic agreement that&#8217;s being negotiated.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And, you know, third, any kind of deal like that requires trust, and Putin hasn&#8217;t given the world any reason to trust his word.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And the last thing I would say is: We know, David, these sanctions work through market-based channels.&nbsp; Markets are forward looking.&nbsp; So once you change the direction of sanctions, you know, the market could very well price in the endpoint of that process.&nbsp; So in the same way that the market has applied a multiplier as these sanctions have been put on, it could very well do the same when they begin to be taken off.&nbsp; We know that, and that&#8217;s an important consideration.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Good morning.&nbsp; Just a couple of follow-up questions on these things.&nbsp; Number one, can you clarify when all of these sanctions will be put into place?&nbsp; Does it kickoff today?<br>&nbsp;<br>Number two, can you give any more details about what the President will be discussing with his G7 counterparts?&nbsp; I presume this will be a good chunk of that discussion.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And number three, can you respond broadly to some criticism that these and other sanctions are hurting not only Putin and his government, but also people in Russia who would be &#8212; and who are standing up to him and working on resistance to Russia and the Kremlin?<br>&nbsp;<br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Sure, Jeff.&nbsp; So these sanctions we&#8217;re announcing go into effect in the U.S. today, or, in some cases, they get published to the Federal Register tomorrow &#8212; the export controls, for example &#8212; but they&#8217;re going to be unveiled today.&nbsp; And you&#8217;ll see a factsheet on this shortly.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Other jurisdictions in the G7 are following their own processes.&nbsp; The Europeans are still finalizing their package, so they can speak to the timeline.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>In terms of the purpose of the G7 meeting today, it&#8217;s really about honoring the incredible sacrifices that our people made, the people of Ukraine made, and even the citizens, of course, of the Soviet Union to defeat fascism.&nbsp; And to say, together: Putin is dishonoring those sacrifices by spreading his lies, his disinformation about the barbarism that he is committing in Ukraine.&nbsp; So, it&#8217;s really a chance to speak the truth and to demonstrate our continued unity and our commitment to strengthening Ukraine&#8217;s hand on the battlefield and at the negotiating table, and to also ratchet up the pain on Putin, which segues to your third question.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>You know, these sanctions are not an end to themselves; they&#8217;re intended to change the strategic calculus of the target.&nbsp; And Putin, like any autocrat, has a social contract.&nbsp; And he has taken away the freedom of the people of Russia in exchange for stability, and he&#8217;s no longer delivering upon that.&nbsp; And so, if thousands of body bags are coming home, if debit cards aren&#8217;t working, if shelves aren&#8217;t stocked the way they used to, all people can buy anymore are knockoff clothes and phones and cars.&nbsp; And if Russia is eventually in default and the country is bankrupt, the question we&#8217;re putting to him: Is that the endgame he was really looking for?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, guys, thanks so much for doing this call.&nbsp; Just a few more questions.&nbsp; To follow up, I think, on Jeff’s last question: Obviously, we had heard that this call today was deliberately planned to come ahead of Victory Day.&nbsp; I wonder if you could preview any of the President&#8217;s remarks today &#8212; either to G7 or if he&#8217;s going to speak about it tomorrow &#8212; specifically, on the day where a lot of folks feel like it&#8217;s going to mark a new chapter in the Russian invasion.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And secondly, on sanctions, we know that you&#8217;ve added, of course, more people to the list, but I wonder if &#8212; and I&#8217;m going to butcher her name &#8212; if there&#8217;s been an update on the U.S.’s thinking about sanctioning Putin’s rumored girlfriend, Alina Kabaeva &#8212; we&#8217;ve reported that the EU at least has thought about putting her on the list &#8212; and if you expect that to come up today?<br>&nbsp;<br>And then on the media portion &#8212; obviously, this is something that you guys are kind of moving into this area &#8212; I wonder, in terms of when you&#8217;re talking about blocking U.S. advertising dollars, how much of an impact do you guys think that that practically will have?&nbsp; And has there been an effort on the U.S.’s part to kind of counter the messaging that these different propaganda machines have had actually in Russia to the Russian people?<br>&nbsp;<br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; So I&#8217;ll say &#8212; I’ll try to say a bit more about the G7 meeting.&nbsp; You know, I think what you’ll hear from the leaders today is that we have &#8212; we can take stock of where we are.&nbsp; And we all, I think, have the same perspective on where Putin has &#8212; where Putin has failed in this effort.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>You know, in terms of his objectives, he set out, first and foremost, to divide the West, but we&#8217;re stronger and more united than at any point in the post-Cold War era.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And he aimed to undermine or topple Ukraine&#8217;s leadership, but the democratically elected government of Ukraine still stands.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And he seemed to expect a quick victory in Kyiv, but it&#8217;s still standing.&nbsp; And he&#8217;s now retreated and focused elsewhere.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So this is already a failure for Putin.&nbsp; And, you know, we&#8217;re going to continue to honor the brave fighting that&#8217;s taking place by Ukraine&#8217;s people, and listen to President Zelenskyy, and just recommit to staying the course, to staying unified.&nbsp; And to ratcheting up the costs on Putin to strengthen Ukraine’s hands on the battlefield and, again, at the negotiating table.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>In terms of Putin&#8217;s girlfriend, I don&#8217;t have anything for you there.&nbsp; I know the EU is looking at this; we&#8217;re looking at this.&nbsp; But I don&#8217;t have an announcement for you to make on that front today.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And then lastly, on the media &#8212; the media actions, the TV stations &#8212; just to give you a bit more: We are sanctioning the three main television stations in Russia: Channel One, Russia, One, NTV.&nbsp; These are all stations owned by the state or controlled by the state or owned by one of Putin&#8217;s closest allies.&nbsp; They&#8217;re also among the most widely watched in Russia.&nbsp; It&#8217;s how most people in Russia get their news from the television.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And, you know, the reality is: Western companies were among the top advertisers on these stations last year &#8212; well above $300 million worth of advertising.&nbsp; A lot of these advertisers have announced since the invasion that they&#8217;re going to cut their business activity with these stations, but we want to make sure that decision endures and just send a broader signal that U.S. companies should not be in the business of funding Russian propaganda.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The other element of this sanction is that Russian TV stations, in many cases, rely on Western technology to broadcast the propaganda.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s what I was referring to when I mentioned the video cameras, the microphones, the controls for digital sound, lighting equipment, software servers.&nbsp; Russia can try to produce these components domestically.&nbsp; But the idea here is to make that commercially difficult, unprofitable, put more of the burden on the Russian state.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re not going to be in the business of helping them broadcast some of the lies and the deceit that you hear from Putin every day.<br>&nbsp;<br>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; Thanks, [senior administration official].&nbsp; And thanks, everyone, for joining.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>As a reminder, this call was on background, attributable to a “senior administration official.”&nbsp; The contents of this call are embargoed until 12:00 p.m. Eastern today.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>You guys should have also gotten the factsheet &#8212; embargoed until 12:00 p.m.&nbsp; If you didn&#8217;t, please feel free to reach out to me and we&#8217;ll make sure you get that.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So, thanks again, everyone, for joining.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Thanks, everybody.</p>
