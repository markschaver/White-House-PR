<p>1:43 P.M. EDT<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; In the birthplace of American democracy, President Biden will articulate how to meet the greatest threat to the right to vote and the integrity of our elections since the Civil War, renew his call for vital legislation to overcome the rash of anti-voter legis- &#8212; laws motivated by the Big Lie, and underline the all-of-government efforts the Biden-Harris administration launched to use the powers of the executive branch to protect and advance the sacred constitutional right to vote.<br>&nbsp;<br>The President will highlight that the greatest irony of the 28 voter suppression laws that have been passed across 17 states this year alone is that the 2020 election stands as a model for the trustworthiness and precision of our system, given that over 80 judges, including judges appointed by his predecessor, threw out every challenge to it.<br>&nbsp;<br>The President will give Democrats credit for unanimously voting to advance the For the People Act and decry the Republican obstruction of its path, and he will reiterate that the work to pass it and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement are only beginning.<br>&nbsp;<br>He will also blast the denial of the right to vote as grounded in autocracy, under- &#8212; undemocratic and un-American and unpatriotic.<br>&nbsp;<br>And he will note that while voter suppression &#8212; that vote &#8212; while voter suppression that these 21st century Jim Crow laws represent is sadly not unprecedented in American history, these new insidious moves to empower partisans over independent election authorities, in terms of who counts the votes, are new and extremely dangerous.<br>&nbsp;<br>Such efforts, which could allow partisans to throw out the votes of anyone for made-up reasons, are the most significant threat to today to the integrity of our elections and to the security of the right to vote.<br>&nbsp;<br>The President will call for a new coalition made up of advocates, activists, students, faith leaders, labor leaders, and business execs &#8212; executives to overcome this un-American trend and meet the moment as far as turnout and voter education.<br>&nbsp;<br>The President will repeat that these are the most egregious attempts to harm the integrity of our democracy since the Civil War, but that if we show the will to save and strengthen our democracy, this can be turned back.</p>



<p>Also, this week, the Vice President will meet with the Texas legislators who broke quorum to block legislation that would have made it significantly harder for the people of Texas to vote.</p>



<p>There is growing bipartisan momentum in Congress as we look towards the &#8212; the historic framework that came together &#8212; the bipartisan framework &#8212; that this is the product of hard work &#8212; which was a product of hard work by Democrats and Republicans and which would make the most significant investment in our roads and bridges since the creation &#8212; the creation of the Interstate Highway System; connect every American to broadband, including in underserved rural areas; stop our children from drinking poisoned water that can impact them for life; secure our leadership in the clean energy economy; and make the biggest investments in American rail since Amtrak.</p>



<p>As Senator Portman said yesterday, people want to see our infrastructure be improved.&nbsp; They&#8217;re tired of waiting in traffic during their rush-hour commute.&nbsp; People are tired of worrying about lead pipes.&nbsp; It&#8217;s very popular because it&#8217;s something people know &#8212; know is needed.</p>



<p>And just this morning, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, on a bipartisan basis, wrote to both chambers of Congress, advocating for quick passage of the framework.&nbsp; They wrote, &#8220;The bipartisan infrastructure framework is crucial to making meaningful progress on one of the most pressing and unifying challenges facing our country…&nbsp; we believe that this framework deserves bipartisan support in the United States Senate and United States House of Representatives.&#8221;&nbsp; The American people are calling out for these investments, and we&#8217;re going to deliver.</p>



<p>One last thing, following up on Jen&#8217;s announcement of us continuing to read out some of the innovative activities we are doing to get more Americans vaccinated: Tomorrow, Olivia Rodrigo will come to the White House to meet with the President and Dr. Fauci, and record videos about the importance of young people getting vaccinated, including answering important questions young people have about getting vaccinated.&nbsp; The videos will be featured on Olivia&#8217;s channels &#8212; 28 million-plus followers across the channels and the White House social pages.<br>&nbsp;<br>With that, I will take the first question.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yesterday, Senator Sanders &#8212; Bernie Sanders came out of the White House and said, in essence, to ask him &#8212; meaning the President &#8212; to stay the negotiations on the reconciliation bill &#8212; in particular, where things stand with a topline number.&nbsp; Can you give us an update on that?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; They &#8212; look, the President and Senator Sanders &#8212; who have worked closely together and they have, as you know, a friendship, a relationship &#8212; they agree that the budget resolution must include key priorities, including universal pre-K, extending the Child Care Tax Credit, tax incentives and rebates for electric &#8212; electric vehicles.<br>&nbsp;<br>Senator Sanders is continuing to negotiate a resolution package, and the President is confident that we’ll pass something similar to his Build Back Better agenda.&nbsp; We leave that process to &#8212; to Congress.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was there a discussion of a topline figure?&nbsp; Senator Sanders had suggested up to $6 trillion.&nbsp; Where does the President stand on that?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; There&#8217;s nothing more that I can read out.&nbsp; He is leaving that to Congress on &#8212; on those pieces of the pieces of legislation, including the monetary component of it as well.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the President going to mention the filibuster today in his speech?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; As you could imagine, the President &#8212; the President believes that we have to make the filibuster work the way it used to.&nbsp; He has talked about this.&nbsp; As a senator for 36 years, he understands how this process works.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>We have to make people stand there and command floor; this is the talking filibuster that he has spoken to many times.&nbsp; From 1970 to 1971, it was invoked 58 times.&nbsp; Last year alone, there were five times that many.&nbsp; For example, it used to be you had to stand there and talk and talk and talk until you collapse.&nbsp; And guess what?&nbsp; People got tired of talking, filibuster broke down, and we were able to break the filibuster, get a quorum, and vote.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So, his position hasn&#8217;t changed on this.&nbsp; He sees this as a, you know, Senate procedural process.&nbsp; But he has talked about the talking filibuster many times.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does the President plan to meet with the Texas Democrats that are in Washington?&nbsp; And does he think they are doing the right thing by fleeing Texas?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; So, I’ll say this, Weijia: The Texas legislation is part of a concerted attack on our democracy being advanced in state houses across the country on the basis of the same repeatedly disproven lies that led to the assault on our nation &#8212; nation&#8217;s Capitol on January 6th.<br>&nbsp;<br>The President&#8217;s message in Philadelphia today is simple and straightforward: The most funda- &#8212; foundational right is the right to vote freely and fairly, and have that vote counted.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The fact of the matter is that the Texas legislation would make it harder to vote in a state where it is already too hard for many to vote.&nbsp; As you&#8217;ve heard from the President, he has said that the Texas anti-voter bill is part of an assault on democracy that we&#8217;ve seen far too often this year, and often disproportionately targeting Black and brown Americans.&nbsp; It&#8217;s wrong and it&#8217;s un-American.<br>&nbsp;<br>I don’t have a specific announcement on when he will be meeting &#8212; or if, I should say &#8212; with the Texas legislators, but he applauds their courage.&nbsp; And this adds to the urgency for passage of the For the People and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, along with the all-of-government effort we have launched, and the movement he’s calling for today &#8212; to overcome this moment with voter turnout and voter education.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you know &#8212; you said the Vice President is going to meet with the Democrats.&nbsp; Do you have any more information on that &#8212; when and where it will be?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; I don’t.&nbsp; It’s going to be sometime this week she’ll be meeting with them.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karine, do you have any updates on either Haiti or Cuba?&nbsp; The President, yesterday, said that, you know, he’s looking at options to support folks in both those countries.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; So, as you mentioned, Justin, the President said yesterday, “We are careful- &#8212; we are closely following the developments in Haiti in the wake of the horrific assassination of the &#8212; of their President that recently took place.”&nbsp; We reiterate our deepest condolences to the family of President Moïse and to the Haitian people, and wish First Lady Martine Moïse a swift recovery.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And to echo the President: The people of Haiti deserve peace and security, and Haiti’s political leaders need to come together for the good of their country.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>As you all know, the President dispatched a high-level interagency expert delegation to assess the situation and to determine whether United States can offer our support.&nbsp; We are in close consultation with the Haitian government.&nbsp; And we will &#8212; he said, even yesterday, he&#8217;ll have more to share in the upcoming days.<br>&nbsp;<br>As for Cuba, yesterday, as well, the President recognized the protests that are happening in Cuba, calling them “remarkable,” saying that the Cuban people are demanding their freedom from an authoritarian regime.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The President reiterated that the United States stands firmly with the people of Cuba as they assert their universal rights.&nbsp; And he called on the government of Cuba to refrain from violence or attempts to silence the voice of the people of Cuba.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karine, a number of Democratic senators have said that not every part of President Biden&#8217;s infrastructure package &#8212; particularly under reconciliation &#8212; should have to be paid for.&nbsp; So, does the White House still believe that the infrastructure plans have to be offset or is it open to some parts of it in the package not being paid for?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; So, the bipartisan framework is a historic agreement that brings together Democrats and Republicans to invest in our nation&#8217;s future in a way that hasn&#8217;t been done in decades.&nbsp; The President offered his own ideas about how to pay for this investment through reforming the corporate tax code, and the Republicans offered theirs.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The offsets are reasonable and responsible compromise.&nbsp; He sees this as also being fiscally responsible.&nbsp; After all, there is good evidence that the infrastructure investment, like that in this legislation, can help &#8212; can help fact &#8212; can, in fact, help pay for itself over the long run by expanding the economy, creating good jobs.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Studies done after the framework was announced have corroborated that.&nbsp; And these offsets are on top of those savings, and the savings claimed from long-term economic growth is smaller than what it would &#8212; likely to occur.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We’re landing.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Yeah.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The websites of this Russian gang who might have been responsible for the Kaseya hack reveal they are shut down.&nbsp; Are you aware of this?&nbsp; Do you have anything on this?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; I don’t have anything &#8212; anything further to share on that.&nbsp; I don’t have anything to share (inaudible).<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karine, yesterday, Jen said she was going to double check on the U.S. delegation in Haiti.&nbsp; Do you know if all the members have returned?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Yes, all the members have returned from the delegation.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; No problem.&nbsp; All right?<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think we’re okay.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Thank you.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Karine.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Roosevelt Room</p>



<p>1:39 P.M. EDT</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:  Folks, I want to start by recognizing the remarkable protests that are taking place in Cuba, with the Cuban people demanding their freedom from an authoritarian regime.  And I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ve seen anything like this protest in a long, long time &#8212; if, quite frankly, ever.</p>



<p>The United States stands firmly with the people of Cuba as they assert their universal rights.&nbsp; And we call on the government &#8212; the government of Cuba to refrain from violence or attempts to silence the voice of the people of Cuba.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And we&#8217;re also closely following the developments in Haiti in the wake of the horrific assassination of the President that recently took place.&nbsp; The people of Haiti deserve peace and security, and Haiti&#8217;s political leaders need to come together for the good of their country.</p>



<p>Over the weekend, I dispatched a high-level, expert delegation to assess the situation and to determine where the United States can offer our support.</p>



<p>And finally, as a close neighbor and friend of the people of both Cuba and Haiti, the United States stands ready to continue to provide assistance, and I&#8217;ll have more for you as we move on.</p>



<p>But the purpose of the meeting today is we&#8217;ve convened a group of law enforcement and other community leaders, including mayors of the &#8212; of our cities, one, to thank them for their service because we owe them big time; second, to hear directly from each of them about reducing violent crime and, particularly, gun violence in our communities.</p>



<p>Last month, I met with a similar group to unveil my comprehensive strategy to do just that.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s been &#8212; it&#8217;s been an &#8212; you know, I guess &#8212; I look at the Attorney General &#8212; we&#8217;ve been this a lo- &#8212; at this a long time.&nbsp; A long time.&nbsp; It seems like most of my career I&#8217;ve been dealing with this issue.</p>



<p>While there&#8217;s no &#8220;one-size-fit-all&#8221; approach, we know there are some things that work, and the first of those that work is stemming the flow of firearms used to commit violent crimes.&nbsp; And we&#8217;ve talked &#8212; you and I have talked about this, Mayor, before.</p>



<p>MAYOR BOWSER:&nbsp; Mm-hmm.&nbsp; Absolutely.</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:  And it includes cracking down on holding rogue gun dealers accountable for violating the federal law.  It includes the Justice Department creating five new strike forces to crack down on illegal gun trafficking (inaudible) supplying weapons to cities of New York &#8212; from New York to the Bay Area.</p>



<p>Secondly, it&#8217;s supporting local law enforcement with the federal support they need.&nbsp; Our strategy provides including funding for law enforcement through the American Rescue Plan for states, cities, and to be able to hire police and pay them overtime in order to advance community policing.</p>



<p>Third, our plan invests in community violence and intervention.&nbsp; We &#8212; what we want to do is when we &#8212; we know we utilize trusted community members and encourage more community policing, we can intervene before the violence erupts &#8212; at least that&#8217;s what, I think, consensus and our experience.&nbsp; And community violence intervention programs have shown to reduce crime in some cities by up to 60 percent.</p>



<p>Fourthly, our strategy to fund the other vital services, like mental health and substance abuse disorder programs, job training, and summer job programs.&nbsp; And this is going to help prevent crime and support young people to pick up a paycheck instead of a pistol.</p>



<p>And fifth, our strategy helps formerly incarcerated people successfully reenter society with housing, jobs, and training, and other support that, up to now, have been denied to them.&nbsp; Somebody gets &#8212; gets out of jail right now, after serving their time, they get a bus ticket and 25 bucks, and they end up under the same bridge they left.&nbsp; And we know this will help.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This will make us all safer.&nbsp; The American Rescue Plan funds programs to help get job training, apprenticeships, and work experience so they can gain stability and security and a chance for a better life.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s a lot more to my strategy, but at &#8212; that’s at the core.&nbsp; It&#8217;s about coordinating at a federal, state, and local level.&nbsp; That&#8217;s what, ultimately, we&#8217;re going to talk about today.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We recognize that we have to come together to fulfill the first responsibility of a democracy and to keep each other safe.&nbsp; And that’s what the American people are looking for when it comes to reducing violent crime and gun violence.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I think this group is illustrative of &#8212; of what we need to get put together, and I want to thank them for being here.&nbsp; And I&#8217;m going to look forward to hearing from them because I&#8217;m going to be asking them what they think we should be doing on the federal level.</p>



<p>So, thank you very much.&nbsp; And we&#8217;ll have more to say as we move on.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. President, would you consider changing the embargo on Cuba?&nbsp; Would you consider making any changes to the embargo with Cuba?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you will be ready to change Trump&#8217;s reversal on Cuba, Mr. President?</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; We are going to have more to say about Cuba and Haiti as the week goes on and &#8212; so stay tuned.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">James S. Brady Press Briefing Room</p>



<p>12:52 P.M. EDT</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;Hi, everyone. &nbsp;Happy Monday. &nbsp;Okay, just two items for all of you at the top. &nbsp;</p>



<p>This afternoon, the President will be joined by Attorney General Garland, as well as law enforcement leaders, elected officials, and a community violence intervention expert to discuss his comprehensive plan to reduce gun violence and violent crime. &nbsp;During the meeting, the President will discuss his crime reduction stragedy [sic] &#8212; strategy, which gives cities and states historic funding through the American Rescue Plan and a range of tools they can use to improve public safety in co- &#8212; their communities, including support for community violence intervention programs, summer employment opportunities, and other proven methods to reduce crime. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The President will also highlight his strong support for and partnership with local leaders to work to reduce gun crime in their communities, like the ones joining him today, and he&#8217;ll underscore his commitment to ensuring their state and law enfor- &#8212; local law enforcement have the resources and support they need to hire more police officers and invest in effective and accountable community policing. &nbsp;</p>



<p>And the President will discuss the work the federal government is doing to stem the flow of guns used in crimes, including the administration&#8217;s zero-tolerance policy for dealers who willfully sell guns illegally; the Department of Justice&#8217;s gun trafficking strike forces; as well as previous steps the White House has announced, like cracking down on &#8220;ghost guns,&#8221; which are increasingly used in violent crimes. &nbsp;</p>



<p>One other update: In COVID news, we want to make sure we are lifting up some of the innowative [sic] &#8212; innovative ways that Americans across the country are meeting their communities where they are with the vaccine. &nbsp;We all have a duty to continue making the case for the vaccine to our friends and family. &nbsp;Companies, media, and individuals all can play a special role as trusted messengers to an unvaccinated person by sharing the facts that the vaccines are safe, effective, accessible, and free. &nbsp;Across the country we&#8217;re seeing Americans step up.</p>



<p>So I want to create some updates &#8212; I&#8217;ll give you some updates and lift up some of the innovative ways we are working with &#8212; to reach Americans with the shot. &nbsp;</p>



<p>So, today, I&#8217;m starting with the first example: truck stops. &nbsp;In the last few months, North Dakota, South Carolina, and Iowa all set up vaccine sites for truckers, with the goal of literally meeting these Americans where they are at, in their trucks or out of their trucks. &nbsp;Since then, more than 9,000 truckers have received a vaccine at these pop-up sites. &nbsp;We&#8217;ll provide more updates in the days and weeks ahead. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead, Jonathan. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;Thanks, Jen. &nbsp;Two matters, both overseas. &nbsp;A couple of questions on Haiti first. &nbsp;The delegation that was sent down there &#8212; has anyone remained in Haiti to continue to oversee what&#8217;s happening? &nbsp;Or have &#8212; has there been any commitment to provide security forces to Haiti? &nbsp;And has the U.S. taken any steps to organize, perhaps, emissaries or troops from other countries to help safeguard the situation?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;So, as we announced last week, an interagency delegation, as you noted, was on the ground in Port-au-Prince yesterday and returned home. &nbsp;I&#8217;m not aware of anyone staying from that delegation on the ground. &nbsp;I will check that important detail for you after the briefing. &nbsp;</p>



<p>But while they were there, as we announced in our readout, they worked to get a better understanding of their request for assistance and to offer assistance to law enforcement forces &#8212; the law enforcement process, I should say, on the ground. &nbsp;They met with both the acting prime minister and prime minister-designate, as &#8212; both of those individuals. &nbsp;And they did receive requests while they were there on the ground for additional assistance. &nbsp;</p>



<p>They did also brief the President this morning. &nbsp;He will receive regular briefings, as he does from his national security team, on the events in Haiti, the requests coming in, and how we can help. &nbsp;</p>



<p>What was clear from their visit, also, what that was &#8212; I should say, &#8220;what was not clear&#8221; is what the future of political leadership looks like in the country. &nbsp;And it was a reminder how vital it is for Haiti&#8217;s leaders to come together to chart a united path forward. &nbsp;</p>



<p>So, while we will continue to &#8212; this is just the beginning of our conversations. &nbsp;And we will remain in close touch with law enforcement, with individuals in Haiti, with a range of leaders in Haiti about how we can assist and provide assistance moving forward. &nbsp;I don&#8217;t have any announcements to portray &#8212; to convey to all of you about assistance &#8212; additional assistance today.</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;So, just to clarify, as of right now, the U.S. is not committing to having any sort of presence on the ground in Haiti?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;Well, that&#8217;s not what I conveyed. &nbsp;We had a delegation that went down yesterday; they came back yesterday. &nbsp;They briefed the President this morning, as &#8212; as was &#8212; as we committed to. &nbsp;But I don&#8217;t have any &#8212; what was clear from their trip is that there is a lack of clarity about the future of political leadership. &nbsp;That&#8217;s an important step that the people of Haiti, the different governing leaders of Haiti need to work together to determine a united path forward. &nbsp;And we will remain deeply engaged, as we have been for months prior to the assassination, with individuals in Haiti to provide assistance moving forward. &nbsp;But I don&#8217;t have any new assistance to announce for you at this point in time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;And the other matter for me is on Cuba. &nbsp;The President &#8212; we saw the President&#8217;s statement today about the demonstrations there on the island yesterday. &nbsp;Two questions on that. &nbsp;But why hasn&#8217;t President Biden taken steps to undo some of the things that his predecessor, Donald Trump, did to overturn the overtures made by President Obama? &nbsp;</p>



<p>And then, secondly, we heard there&#8217;s a &#8212; obviously, a great cry yesterday &#8212; or during these protests for vaccines. &nbsp;Has Cuba &#8212; on the list to get vaccines from the United States?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;Well, first, let me say that we have actually provided, over the course of the last several months, a great deal of assistance to Cuba. &nbsp;I just want to note this because I think it&#8217;s important for people to understand. &nbsp;Since, FY- &#8212; since 2009, which is quite some time ago, Congress has directed $20 million in democracy assistance annually. &nbsp;</p>



<p>But even if you look at last year: Last year alone, the U.S. exported $176 million of goods to Cuba. &nbsp;In the first six months of 2021, Cuba imported $123 million worth of chicken from the United States &#8212; just as an example. &nbsp;Obviously, one of the issues that the ind- &#8212; that protesters are justifiably out there in the streets protesting about is hunger, is lack of access to vaccines, et cetera. &nbsp;But we are continuing to provide a range of assistance, which we will continue to do. &nbsp;</p>



<p>I will say, on vaccines, one of the challenges, Jonathan, which you may be familiar with, is that Cuba has not joined COVAX and has indicated they intend to vaccinate their population using the Abdala vaccine, which they&#8217;re &#8212; the Pan American Health Organization has been out there urging Cuban scientists to publish their &#8212; their results in the peer-reviewed literature on this vaccine. &nbsp;</p>



<p>So, in terms of &#8212; COVAX would be a mechanism that we have provided, as you all know, vaccines to a range of countries in the world. &nbsp;We certainly recognize and understand that access to vaccines is one of the issues that a number of individuals in the streets is voicing concern about, but we have to determine what the mechanism would be to work with the Cuban people to get vaccines to them. &nbsp;That&#8217;s something we&#8217;re working through.</p>



<p>Okay. &nbsp;Go ahead, Jeff.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;Jen, just to follow up on Cuba: Can you give us a sense of where the President&#8217;s policy review on Cuba is right now? &nbsp;Do you anticipate making any changes, as Jonathan asked? &nbsp;And where do you see it going from here?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;Well, I will say first &#8212; and I meant to say this in response to Jonathan &#8212; but there&#8217;s every indication that yesterday&#8217;s protests were spontaneous expressions of people who are exhausted with the Cuban government&#8217;s economic mismanagement and repression. &nbsp;And those &#8212; these are protests inspired by the harsh reality of everyday life in Cuba, not people in another country. &nbsp;I&#8217;m saying that because I think there have been a range of accusations out there, as you well know, Jeff.</p>



<p>In terms of our assessment of a future &#8212; our current pol- &#8212; our policy, I should say, it continues to be &#8212; our approach continues to be governed by two principles: First, support for democracy and human rights &#8212; which is going to continue to be at the core of our efforts &#8212; through empowering the Cuban people to determine their own future. &nbsp;Second, Americans, especially Cuban Americans, are the best ambassadors for freedom and prosperity in Cuba. &nbsp;</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t have anything to predict for you in terms of any policy shift. &nbsp;Obviously, given the protests were just happening over the last 24 to 48 hours, we&#8217;re assessing how we can be helpful directly to the people of Cuba in these circumstances.</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;You hinted at this, but the President of Cuba did directly accuse the United States of basically fomenting these protests because of the embargo and that leading to a lack of medicine and the other things. &nbsp;Do you have a specific response to him?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;Well, I&#8217;d first say that the U.S. embargo allows humanitarian goods to reach Cuba. &nbsp;We exidite [sic] &#8212; expedite any request to export humanitarian or med- &#8212; medical supplies to Cuba. &nbsp;That continues to be the case. &nbsp;</p>



<p>And the United States regularly authorizes the export of agricultural products, medicine, medical equipment, and humanitarian goods to Cuba &#8212; and, since 1992, has authorized the export of billions of dollars of those goods to Cuba. &nbsp;</p>



<p>So that&#8217;s simply inaccurate in terms of the facts that are stated. &nbsp;But, again, I would restate what I said a little bit earlier in response, which is that there&#8217;s every indication that yesterday&#8217;s protests were reactions of the people in Cuba to exhaustion of the governance of the &#8212; of the leaders in the state, the economic mismanagement, and the repression that we&#8217;re seeing take place against the people of the country. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;Lastly, there seems to be a disagreement between Pfizer and the U.S. government on the need for booster shots. &nbsp;Do you anticipate getting any clarity on that in this afternoon&#8217;s meeting? &nbsp;And can you just give us a sense of what is at the crux of that disagreement?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;Well, first, this meeting is a meeting that HHS is overseeing, and certainly I would refer you to them for a specific readout of the meeting. &nbsp;But I would say that we don&#8217;t see it as a disagreement per se, but we provide public health information and make determinations based on a large swath of data, and that relates to boosters &#8212; booster shots as well. &nbsp;And some of that information that the FDA and the CDC look at &#8212; and this was in their statement last week &#8212; does include some private-sector data, and that can be part of how they assess what recommendations will be, but it&#8217;s a much broader swath of information and data than that. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, data &#8212; we continue to analyze. &nbsp;Science evolves. &nbsp;And we&#8217;ve long said that we will reserve options &#8212; optionality, including how we&#8217;re purchasing doses of sa- &#8212; vaccines to ensure we have maximum optionality for our own &#8212; the American public. &nbsp;But any assessment would be made by the CDC and the FDA. &nbsp;And we made clear, last week, that wasn&#8217;t a recommendation being made at this time. &nbsp;</p>



<p>I&#8217;d also point to something that Dr. &nbsp;Fauci said yesterday &#8212; when he was out there on some of your networks &#8212; when he conveyed that there could be assessments made about certain swaths of the population as well. &nbsp;</p>



<p>It may not be all or nothing, but that’s something that our scientists will continue to assess. &nbsp;And if they make a conclusion that booster shots are recommended, they will provide that information publicly and it would be based on a large range of data and information.</p>



<p>Go ahead, Karen.</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;Thanks, Jen. &nbsp;I just want to point out that HHS is not commenting on that meeting that’s taking place today with Pfizer. &nbsp;There&#8217;s nothing else you could share ahead of that of how seriously the administration is considering the possibility of booster shots?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;Well, not to minimize the meeting, but I would say that we regularly meet with and engage with health and medical &#8212; our health and medical experts do, I should say &#8212; regularly work and meet with companies to understand the latest data, and that would certainly be a part of an assessment of recommendations moving forward.</p>



<p>The point I was making, in response to Jeff&#8217;s question, was that it&#8217;s not based on, solely, the information or data from one company, which hasn&#8217;t been concluded or hasn&#8217;t been fully published publicly either. &nbsp;So, you know &#8212; but our health and medical experts will look at the data around the vaccine holistically, will use any further data as a consideration moving forward. &nbsp;</p>



<p>But I wouldn&#8217;t see this meeting today &#8212; I&#8217;m not surprised that there&#8217;s not a big readout from HHS, I should say. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;And you mentioned other companies. &nbsp;Has the administration heard from any of the other vaccine producers about the possibility of a booster shot and what they&#8217;re pushing for?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;Again, I would leave that to any company to provide any information publicly about what they&#8217;re assessing. &nbsp;We are in touch with leaders of these companies regularly. &nbsp;We do look at our own data. &nbsp;We welcome their data as a part of that assessment, but we&#8217;ll make &#8212; the CDC and the FDA will make a recommendation based on their own assessment.</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;And just one more quick one. &nbsp;If there is a third shot recommended, would the government cover the cost of that shot as well? &nbsp;And what considerations would have to take place to get funding for that?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;Well, we have, in our &#8212; in our contingency planning, led by Jeff Zients and the COVID team &#8212; I think we&#8217;ve indicated from here that we have purchased the number of doses we have and indicated we want to increase manufacturing in these facilities around the country because we want to have maximum optionality, including &#8212; depending on what is most effective with children under the age of 12 &#8212; including if there is a booster shot needed. &nbsp;</p>



<p>So that is certainly &#8212; has long been in our planning, even &#8212; even in advance of knowing whether that will be a recommendation made by our health experts. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;Thanks, Jen. &nbsp;What can you tell us about the President&#8217;s message in his voting rights speech tomorrow? &nbsp;Is going to be pushing more for congressional action? &nbsp;Is he going to be talking about state action? &nbsp;And what is his strategy to tackle this issue beyond the speech tomorrow?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;Sure. &nbsp;Well, first &#8212; well, thank you for the question, because he&#8217;s very focused on this speech tomorrow &#8212; one that he himself wanted to deliver.</p>



<p>He&#8217;ll lay out the moral case for why denying the right to vote is a form of suppression and a form of silencing. &nbsp;And how he will use &#8212; he will redouble his commitment to using every tool at his disposal to continue to fight to protect the fundamental right of Americans to vote against the onslaught of voter suppression laws, based on a dangerous and discredited conspiracy theory that culminated in an assault on our Capitol. &nbsp;</p>



<p>He’ll call out &#8212; the greatest irony of the Big Lie is that no election in our history has met such a high standard, with over 80 judges, including those appointed by his predecessor, throwing out all challenges.</p>



<p>He&#8217;ll also decry efforts to strip the right to vote as authoritarian and anti-American, as a &#8212; and stand up against the notion that politicians should be allowed to choose their voters or to subvert our system by replacing independent election authorities with partisan ones.</p>



<p>And he will highlight the work of the administration against this, the necessity of passing the For the People Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, and how we need to work together with civil rights organizations to build as broad a turnout and voter education system to overcome the worst challenge to our democracy since the Civil War.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, this is an opportunity for him to make the case to the American people about how this is a fundamental right, what he will continue to do from the federal government. &nbsp;I would remind you, he signed a historic executive order on the 56th anniversary of Selma, which put in place funding measures and a priority from the federal government. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The Department of Justice has already used tools to fight against these laws in states. &nbsp;They will continue to. &nbsp;He&#8217;ll talk about that as well. &nbsp;</p>



<p>But the last piece is he will talk about, also, the importance of empowering, engaging, and supporting efforts around the country to make sure people know their rights and understand how to participate in the process.</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;So it sounds like this is the first of what might be a series of speeches around the country?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;Well, I think he&#8217;s been clear and I think he&#8217;s told all of you that expanding the right to vote, the ac- &#8212; access of people across the country to vote is going to be a fight of his presidency. &nbsp;He&#8217;s asked his Vice President to play a leading role in that effort. &nbsp;He&#8217;ll talk about that as well tomorrow. &nbsp;And he&#8217;ll certainly continue to talk about it out around the country, but I don&#8217;t have anything to preview for you in terms of additional comments or remarks.</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;And then you&#8217;ve said that there&#8217;s going to be a meeting at some point this week between U.S. officials and Russian officials about cybercrimes. &nbsp;When is that meeting taking place? &nbsp;Is it in person or virtual? &nbsp;Who&#8217;s participating? &nbsp;And what&#8217;s the message going to be from White House officials?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;Well, first, there have been ongoing meetings at an expert level and discussions with Russian officials. &nbsp;And the most important thing we can do is preserve a space for those conversations to happen and, hopefully, progress to be made. &nbsp;</p>



<p>So, we&#8217;re not going to be reading out the agenda of these meetings or providing lists of participants. &nbsp;I think it&#8217;s safe to assume that high-level cybersecurity experts and members of our national security team are the appropriate points of contact with their Russian counterparts. &nbsp;But these meetings have been ongoing, as have the discussions, and this is a part of that process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;Thank you, Jen. &nbsp;Does President Biden agree with Dr. Fauci that, at the local level, there should be more vaccine mandates?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;Well, I don&#8217;t have the full context of Dr. Fauci’s comments in front of me. &nbsp;But I will say that &#8212;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;I do have it if you want.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;Oh, go ahead. &nbsp;Let&#8217;s hear it.</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;He said: “I&#8217;ve been of this opinion and I remain of that opinion that I do believe, at the local level, Jake, there should be more mandates. &nbsp;There really should be. &nbsp;We&#8217;re talking about [a] life-and-death situation. &nbsp;We&#8217;ve lost 600,000 Americans already, and we&#8217;re still losing more people.”</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;Well, I would say first, from the federal government, I &#8212; if I remember the context of the question, it was about federal mandates, I believe &#8212; correct me if I&#8217;m wrong. &nbsp;That&#8217;s not a decision that we are making. &nbsp;That&#8217;s not a &#8212; that is not our intention from the federal government. &nbsp;</p>



<p>There will be decisions made by private-sector entities, by universities, by educational institutions, and even perhaps by local leaders, should they decide that is how to keep their community safe. &nbsp;If they decide to make that decision, we certainly support them in that step.</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;The President said, on March 11th, “My message to you is this: Listen to Dr. Fauci.” &nbsp;Is he now saying, “Don&#8217;t listen to Dr. Fauci&#8221; if he doesn’t agree?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;Welcome back.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;Thank you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;I would say that what the &#8212; what Dr. Fauci was conveying is that there will be decisions made by local leaders, just like there will be decisions made by business leaders, by institutional leaders on how they can keep their communities safe, and we support their right to make those decisions.</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;Thank you. &nbsp;And then on Cuba: You&#8217;re talking today about how some of these protests are inspired by people exhausted with the government. &nbsp;Why is it that yesterday the State Department was saying that this was all happening out of concern about rising COVID cases?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;Well, I would say first that the protests were just happening yesterday. &nbsp;We&#8217;re still assessing what is motivating and, of course, is driving all of the individuals who came to the streets. &nbsp;</p>



<p>But we know that when I &#8212; we say “exhaustion,” the &#8212; the manner by which the people of Cuba are governed, that can cover a range of issues, whether it&#8217;s economic suppression; media suppression; lack of access to health and medical supplies, including vaccines. &nbsp;There are a range of reasons and voices we&#8217;re hearing from people on the ground who are protesting.</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;So when these protesters are yelling “freedom” and “enough,” there are people within the administration who think they&#8217;re saying, “freedom from rising COVID cases”?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;Again, I would say that when people are out there in the streets protesting and complaining about the lack of access &#8212; to economic prosperity, to the medical supplies they need, to a life they deserve to live &#8212; that can take on a range of meanings. &nbsp;</p>



<p>There&#8217;s a global pandemic right now. &nbsp;Most people in that country don&#8217;t have access to vaccines. &nbsp;That certainly is something we&#8217;d love to help with.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;A few months ago, when asked about Cuba policy, you said it was not a priority for the President to review U.S. policy toward Cuba. &nbsp;Do the events of this weekend change that?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;Well, I would say, Kelly, that we, of course, are monitoring closely. &nbsp;You saw the &#8212; the statement the President &#8212; we put out in the President&#8217;s name this morning from &#8212; in his voice, of course, conveying his support for the people of Cuba; making clear that he doesn&#8217;t support the approach of the government of Cuba, which he&#8217;s &#8212; he has never held &#8212; he has never been &#8212; held back on.</p>



<p>In terms of where it ranks in a priority order, I&#8217;m not in a position to offer that, but I can tell you that we will be closely engaged. &nbsp;We will be looking to provide support to the people of Cuba. &nbsp;We certainly, you know, support the freedom of speech, the freedom of press, the freedom of &#8212; when we believe they deserve to have access to the economic support and medical support, health supplies that many of them are asking for.</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;And on voting rights: Texas Democrats, who have been working through their process, some of them plan to leave the state, come here. &nbsp;Is there any plan for the President or the political arm of the White House to meet with them? &nbsp;What can you update us on that?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;I don&#8217;t have any &#8212; let me check on that for you, Kelly. &nbsp;It&#8217;s &#8212; and certainly it&#8217;s possible there are people here who plan to meet with them as we have in the past when oth- &#8212; other legislators have come to Washington. &nbsp;So, let me see if there&#8217;s a planned meeting with anyone from our team.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;Back on Haiti for a second &#8212; and sort of honing in on the question that Jonathan was asking: What&#8217;s the status of the formal request that the U.S. send troops to Haiti? &nbsp;Is that still under analysis here? &nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;That&#8217;s correct. &nbsp;It&#8217;s still under review.</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;So it&#8217;s not been ruled out?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;No.</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;What is the current assessment here as to how Haiti ranks in terms of American interests &#8212; safety and security there? &nbsp;How important is safety and security to American interests in the President’s mind?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;Well, certainly, the safety and security of the people of Haiti is of great interest to the President and to the administration. &nbsp;</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s particularly constructive to rank order issues happening around the world. &nbsp;They&#8217;re all important. &nbsp;That&#8217;s why we have a big government and why we are focused on doing what we can to support the people of Haiti, support the people of Cuba, continue to address the range of challenges we have around the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Oh, go ahead.</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;One more question. &nbsp;The President, later today, is going to meeting, as you mentioned, with the officials to talk about gun violence and crime. &nbsp;He did something similar less than three weeks ago. &nbsp;Are we &#8212; should we expect to hear something different today than he has so far said about this issue?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;Well, I would say, first, that rise in crime has been an issue in communities across from the country for 18 months, if not more. &nbsp;It’s cost lives, shattered communities. &nbsp;And our focus is on addressing that head on, saving lives. &nbsp;And he feels it’s important enough to communities around the country to continue to voice what his approach is going to be here: advocating for more police with better training and accountability, then &#8212; advocating for the need to keep illegal guns out of the hands of criminals, making sure people understand we need to use every tool at our disposal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, certainly, today is an opportunity to meet with a number of individuals who have played a role in law enforcement, who have been leaders in their communities &#8212; and certainly should be an indication of his ongoing commitment to this important issue.</p>



<p>Go ahead. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;I wanted to just check in on what the President&#8217;s legislative priority is right now. &nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;Sure.</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;The first: For the reconciliation bill, they need to pass a budget resolution.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;Yeah.</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;Seem to be, still, pretty stark divides between, you know, Bernie Sanders, who&#8217;s running the Budget Committee in the Senate, and some of the more moderate senators. &nbsp;So, I&#8217;m wondering: Has the White House decided on a number that they want for that bill? &nbsp;And if not or if you can&#8217;t express one right now, how confident are you &#8212; since we&#8217;re continuing to see this divide as we get later into July &#8212; that you&#8217;re going to be able to bridge that gap by Leader Schumer’s schedule for this?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;Well, first, you know, back in April, when the President said we would move forward on two tracks &#8212; that we would seek a bipartisan agreement on infrastructure and that we would work with Democrats on a budget reconciliation process that included key components of the American Families Plan &#8212; there was some skepticism about the possibility of that moving forward. &nbsp;And that&#8217;s a diplomatic definition of how the &#8212; the broad reaction was. &nbsp;</p>



<p>That&#8217;s exactly what is happening now. &nbsp;And in our view, this is how the legislative process works. &nbsp;Our policy-making muscles have atrophied over the last few years. &nbsp;This is exactly what it looks like; it&#8217;s messy at times. &nbsp;And we fully expect that these negotiations will have ups and downs. &nbsp;</p>



<p>We&#8217;re prepared for that. &nbsp;We&#8217;re going to be closely engaged. &nbsp;The President will be talking with, engaging with, inviting down members to have discussions as needed through this process. &nbsp;But we&#8217;ve already seen speculation that our agenda was dead be disproved over the last several days. &nbsp;And we&#8217;re going to continue to work in close coordination with members moving forward. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, I will say that, as it relates to the budget reconciliation process: That, of course, is for members of the Senate to work through what they can all collectively support together to get enough votes. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The President will continue to advocate for components of his Build Back Better agenda, the American Families Plan &#8212; components he&#8217;s laid out in his budget &#8212; and pieces of his American Jobs Plan that were not included in the bipartisan package. &nbsp;Those will be his priorities as he&#8217;s having these discussions with Chairman Sanders and others who are leading this process. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;And speaking of the bipartisan bill and maybe some of the messiness, there&#8217;s a meeting tomorrow to sort of hammer out the final details now the Senate is coming back. &nbsp;Is the White House going to be involved in that meeting at all? &nbsp;And what&#8217;s your level of confidence at this point that &#8212; you know, obviously, there were some missteps after the deal was announced that threw it into a bit of peril. &nbsp;How confident are you that this is going to move forward in the next couple days? &nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;We expect there to be some significant ups and downs, but we are ready for it. &nbsp;We&#8217;re bracing for it; we&#8217;re also ready for it. &nbsp;And we&#8217;re going to remain very closely engaged at every level in these discussions. &nbsp;</p>



<p>In terms of this specific meeting, I believe we’ll be directly involved in some level, but I can check and see if there&#8217;s more specificity. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;Are there any meetings between the President and lawmakers this week that you can preview, specifically on this?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;There will be, but I don&#8217;t have anything I can preview in this moment. &nbsp;But we&#8217;ll see if there&#8217;s more we can provide.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead, Kaitlan.</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;In his meeting with civil rights leaders last week on voting rights, did the President make any assurances to them? &nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;The President reiterated to them what you&#8217;ve heard him say many times, which is that he is absolutely committed to signing voting rights legislation into law; that he will work side-by-side with them to advocate not just here in Washington, but around the country for moving this forward; and that it is a top priority for him. &nbsp;</p>



<p>And you heard them go out and speak in front of the White House and convey how constructive they felt the meeting was as well. &nbsp;But there&#8217;s no question that these leaders and their organizations are key partners for the President in our efforts to move this legislation forward.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;And, on Cuba, in this White House statement today you note the, quote, “tragic grip of the pandemic.” &nbsp;But under current U.S. sanctions that were put in place by the last administration but have not been changed by this administration, Cuban exiles cannot send remittances to their family that lives in Cuba. &nbsp;So why is the Biden administration continuing that policy? &nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;Well I would say, again, even under the embargo, there are a number of exemptions, I should say &#8212; humanitarian assistance, medical supplies that we&#8217;ve continued to provide assistance to the people of Cuba, even with that in place. &nbsp;</p>



<p>But I have nothing to preview for you in terms of a change of policy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;But even though the President said he was going to reverse the policy, you can&#8217;t say when he plans to reverse the policy? &nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;Again, these protests happened yesterday, I think, or over the last two days. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;But he made the promise in September.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;I certainly understand, Kaitlan, but there&#8217;s nothing I can preview for you. &nbsp;But to be accurate, there are exemptions that we can send hed- &#8212; medical supplies, we can send humanitarian supplies. &nbsp;That&#8217;s something we&#8217;ve been doing for some time from the U.S. government. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead. &nbsp;Go ahead, Shelby.</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;Yeah, I just had two quick ones. &nbsp;So, first, on Cuba: Recently, the New York Times described the American flag as “alienating to some.” &nbsp;We&#8217;ve seen these Cuban protesters flying the American flag as a symbol for freedom. &nbsp;We saw it in Hong Kong as well. &nbsp;So, does the administration support international protesters flying the American flag? &nbsp;And what message do you have to Americans who are wary of flying it here in the U.S.? &nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;Well, I would say, first, the President certainly values and respects the &#8212; the symbol- &#8212; symbol of the American flag. &nbsp;He&#8217;s someone who certainly waves it outside of his house, or does in Delaware and &#8212; and other places where he&#8217;s lived throughout his time. &nbsp;But he also believes that people have the right to peaceful protest, and he thinks both can be true. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s see. &nbsp;Go ahead. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;So the President&#8217;s meeting today &#8212; I know that the White House has promoted using American Rescue Plan money for hiring more police officers. &nbsp;I&#8217;m curious if there&#8217;s going to be some sort of effort to track whether an increase in police officers leads to a reduction in crime in those communities. &nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;Sure. &nbsp;Well, there are a number of places &#8212; and we noted this; we put out a memo that outlines some of the places where there has been an increase in funding. &nbsp;And certainly, there&#8217;s available data. &nbsp;And we will also look closely at where we&#8217;re seeing an impact. &nbsp;</p>



<p>So, Tu- &#8212; in Tucson, Arizona, they announced a plan to invest at least $7 million in community safety, health, and wellness from the American Rescue Plan. &nbsp;In Walla Walla, Washington, they announced they plan to use funding for help in &#8212; for new police hires. &nbsp;In Utica, New York, they announced plans to support gun violence prevention and law enforcement career recruiting efforts. &nbsp;In Albuquerque, New Mexico &#8212; announced plans to invest $3 million to expand a gunshot detection system, $5 million to refurbish stationhouses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, obviously, there are a range of factors that lead to a reduction in crime, and different communities have different challenges, even if guns are &#8212; gun violence is a big driver in many communities across the country. &nbsp;But we&#8217;ll certainly be working closely with them. &nbsp;</p>



<p>We also have these strike forces that we are working &#8212; engaging with about a half a dozen cities around the country to also engage &#8212; to also reduce illegal guns from being on the streets as well. &nbsp;</p>



<p>And all of these measures &#8212; our hope is that they will lead to a reduction in gun violence and crime in these &#8212; in these cities, of course.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;And on voting rights: What is, I guess, the goal here in terms of giving these speeches, given that there&#8217;s still Republican opposition in the Senate? &nbsp;What does the President hope to accomplish in reaching out and talking to the American people about this issue? &nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;Well, I think the President is a big believer that, you know, as someone who has fought against the odds to get hard things done before, that part of what you need to do is build a grassroots army across the country to engage with, to empower, to inform about what their rights are and what the challenges are. &nbsp;</p>



<p>And one of the reasons he&#8217;s going to speak to how stark this issue is &#8212; how, in &#8212; in dozens of states across the country, there are efforts to put in place restrictive voting measures &#8212; is because he wants people across the country to not just look ahead to 2024, but be prepared and eyes wide open about 2022, and also understand and know their rights and understand what the efforts are to silence them around the country. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;Jen, a follow-up on voting rights?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;Go ahead. &nbsp;Go ahead, April.</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;Following that and looking historically, you&#8217;re talking about an army &#8212; pulling together an army in support of voting rights. &nbsp;Is this akin to what LBJ told Dr. King &#8212; “Go make me do it” &#8212; when he talked to him about voting rights, when they went to Selma? &nbsp;Is this an effort to get the coalitions to go out and force Republicans to change their minds? &nbsp;Is that what you&#8217;re talking about? &nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;Well, as you well know and you alluded to, April, this is not a new struggle; it&#8217;s a 60-year struggle. &nbsp;And the President has been at the forefront of this fight throughout his career, from his work leading the effort to reauthorize the Voting Rights Act, to even the steps he&#8217;s taken as President. &nbsp;</p>



<p>So, obviously, this is a new moment that certainly builds on the challenges over the last 60 years with new challenges, including the swath of restrictive laws that &#8212; that many legislatures &#8212; Republican legislatures &#8212; are attempting to put into law across the country. &nbsp;</p>



<p>So, yes, he is going to be calling on Americans to make sure they are informed, make sure they are informing their neighbors, and make sure they are fighting efforts to pass restrictive laws in their states.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;And on the history piece about Haiti: What is this administration doing, when it goes back to the historic nature with administrations in Haiti? &nbsp;Bill Clinton helped Jean-Bertrand Aristide go back into power. &nbsp;Condi Rice went there during the Bush administration under blue-helmet support from the U.N. to talk about democracy. &nbsp;Is this administration looking at the historic nature of what administrations have done as it relates to Haiti in how you are dealing with Haiti today? &nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;Well, certainly, history is always a part of how you &#8212; any leader approaches governing and approaches engagement with foreign governments, or &#8212; or the people of other countries because sometimes that&#8217;s embedded in how they understand or how they think of the United States.</p>



<p>What&#8217;s important to know and understand is that we are &#8212; have provided $75 million for a wide range of issues, including democratic governance, health, education, agricultural development, and strengthening of pre-election activities even before, of course, last week &#8212; that was as of January &#8212; and that we&#8217;ve long been working with &#8212; directly with &#8212; in lifting up, empowering, and training Haiti&#8217;s law enforcement &#8212; improving, I should say &#8212; Haiti&#8217;s law enforcement capacity.</p>



<p>There &#8212; this is a situation, though, in Haiti where the determination of what the next steps are, what the path forward is going to be up to the people of Haiti. &nbsp;Who is going to be leading the country moving forward? &nbsp;When is it safe to have elections? &nbsp;How will they work together to figure out what their needs are? &nbsp;And how can we work with them to assess what those needs are and how we can help meet them here from the government. &nbsp;So, obviously, there &#8212; from the United States, I should say. &nbsp;</p>



<p>So, obviously, there&#8217;s a great deal of uncertainty. &nbsp;There&#8217;s a lot more information we need. &nbsp;Yesterday was just the beginning &#8212; not the beginning, but an important step in our engagement that will certainly continue from a range of entities in the federal government moving forward. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;Jen, over the weekend, House Whip James Clyburn, an ally of the President&#8217;s, called for a filibuster exemption on voting rights as a potential pathway forward for the Senate to pass that legislation. &nbsp;Does the President agree?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;Well, first, I would say that Congressman Clyburn is a good friend of the President and certainly of the administration &#8212; an important partner as we work to get our agenda moving forward.</p>



<p>I will say, though, in terms of how this works, the filibuster is a legislative process tool &#8212; an important one &#8212; that warrants debate, but determination about making changes will be made by members of the Senate, not by this President or any President, frankly, moving forward. &nbsp;And it requires every single Democrat supporting changes. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, I&#8217;m not here to provide a Whip count for all of you, but that&#8217;s not where support currently stands. &nbsp;So, the President&#8217;s view continues to be aligned with what he has said in the past, which that he has not supported the elimination of the filibuster because it has been used, as often, the other way around. &nbsp;</p>



<p>I understand you&#8217;re asking me about an exemption. &nbsp;We don&#8217;t have any new position on that either. &nbsp;</p>



<p>I would note that there are a lot of issues out there &#8212; and I think activists and advocates will tell you this &#8212; where you could argue that there should be an exemption, and this is certainly one of them. &nbsp;But that is what a lot of advocates &#8212; there are advocates for a range of issues, whether it&#8217;s gun rights, climate, who are out there advocating for this.</p>



<p>So he&#8217;s talked about his support for returning to the talking filibuster; he continues to support that. &nbsp;But he, again, believes that, as somebody who was in the Senate for 36 years, we need to continue to work to find a path forward to do hard things, even when they seem challenging. &nbsp;And that&#8217;s what he will do in this case.</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;So, with no pathway, really, forward, and the legislation languishing, is there a plan B? &nbsp;Is there &#8212; like, is he rallying &#8212; I mean, as he is tomorrow &#8212; public support to hopefully change the complexion of the Senate and then try and pass legislation? &nbsp;It just seems like there&#8217;s no, kind of, obvious path forward for legislation that he says that he wants to pass if he&#8217;s not going to change the filibuster rules or advocate for that. &nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;Well, I think &#8212; you know, if you look at even the Supreme Court ruling just a few weeks ago, his view is that &#8212; and he&#8217;ll talk about this tomorrow &#8212; is that that sends the focus back to Congress. &nbsp;And we don&#8217;t accept the notion &#8212; and he&#8217;s an optimist by nature; otherwise, he wouldn&#8217;t be sitting in the Oval Office right now &#8212; that it&#8217;s dead. &nbsp;We don&#8217;t accept that. &nbsp;</p>



<p>We believe there needs to be a path forward. &nbsp;He&#8217;s going to ask the Vice President to help play an important role in determining what that looks like. &nbsp;And we&#8217;re going to continue to advocate, to fight for moving forward on voting rights legislation. &nbsp;And he&#8217;ll certainly elevate the need for the American people to be engaged in that effort moving forward.</p>



<p>Go ahead. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;Jen, we have an out in a minute, if you want to do, like, one more maybe.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;Oh, okay. &nbsp;Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;Thank you, Jen.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;Oh, well, I was going to go to you, if that&#8217;s okay, only because she hasn&#8217;t been here in a while. &nbsp;Go ahead. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;Okay, thanks. &nbsp;Just to follow up on Matt &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;Sure. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;Clyburn was saying that he would like Biden to endorse the carveout either publicly or privately. &nbsp;Like, get on the phone with Machin &#8212; just call him, say that you&#8217;d like to do this.</p>



<p>To bring up LBJ again, as April said, does the President see no role for himself in trying to press these lawmakers, given you say he&#8217;s going to talk about the authoritarian danger of these voting rights? &nbsp;Does he not see that role for himself?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;I think the President sees his role as somebody who can speak from the bully pulpit to elevate and advocate for the need to move forward on voting rights legislation, of course, but also to use every lever in the federal government to protect the rights of the American people to &#8212; to vote around the country. &nbsp;</p>



<p>That is one lever &#8212; is legislation. &nbsp;There are other levers that are at his disposal that we&#8217;ve already started to implement and rely on. &nbsp;And I would just go back to what I said a little bit earlier is that, you know, if it were that &#8212; if it were waving a magic wand to get voting rights legislation on his desk through ever- &#8212; any means, he would do that. &nbsp;But it requires the majority of members in the Senate to support changes to the filibuster. &nbsp;It requires &#8212;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q &nbsp; &nbsp;But what about arm-twisting? &nbsp;I mean, you say a magic wand, but &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;It requires &#8212; again, I&#8217;ll leave it to &#8212; I&#8217;ll leave it to all of you to do a Whip count out there about the support. &nbsp;This is a Senate procedural process. &nbsp;It requires the majority of them to support it.</p>



<p>What he can do as President is to continue to lift up, elevate, advocate, engage, empower people across the country; make sure they understand that this is based on the Big Lie; &nbsp;make sure they are as outraged as he is about efforts around the country to suppress and silence people across the country. &nbsp;That&#8217;s the most instructive role he can play.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m sorry, you &#8212; I&#8217;ve got to go because we&#8217;ve got to &#8212; you&#8217;ve got to gather. &nbsp;Thanks, everyone. &nbsp;We&#8217;ll see you all tomorrow.</p>

<p>We stand with the Cuban people and their clarion call for freedom and relief from the tragic grip of the pandemic and from the decades of repression and economic suffering to which they have been subjected by Cuba&#8217;s authoritarian regime. The Cuban people are bravely asserting fundamental and universal rights. Those rights, including the right of peaceful protest and the right to freely determine their own future, must be respected. The United States calls on the Cuban regime to hear their people and serve their needs at this vital moment rather than enriching themselves.</p>

<p>On July 11, a United States interagency delegation with representatives from the Department of Justice, Department of Homeland Security, Department of State, and National Security Council traveled to Haiti in response to the Haitian government’s request for security and investigative assistance following the July 7 assassination of Haitian President Jovenel Moïse. The delegation reviewed the security of critical infrastructure with Haitian government officials and met with the Haitian National Police, who are leading the investigation into the assassination. The delegation also met with Acting Prime Minister Claude Joseph and Prime Minister-Designate Ariel Henry in a joint meeting, as well as Senate President Joseph Lambert, to encourage open and constructive dialogue to reach a political accord that can enable the country to hold free and fair elections. In all their meetings the delegation committed to supporting the Haitian government as it seeks justice in this case and affirmed the United States’ support for the people of Haiti in this challenging time. The United States stands with Haiti in becoming a safer, more democratic country. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Joint Base Andrews</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Prince George’s County, Maryland</p>



<p>3:15 P.M. EDT</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. President, does it make sense to attack the servers that are used in Russia to carry out &#8212;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; (Inaudible.)</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does it make sense to attack the servers that are used to carry out these ransom attacks in Russia?</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; To attack them?</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well &#8212;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Well, what happened was there was one company that got &#8212; I mean, they weren&#8217;t specifically attacking servers; they were attacking businesses.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean the U.S. response.&nbsp; Up until now, the U.S. response has been to exercise sanctions &#8212; impose sanctions on Russia for this malign activity.&nbsp; Does it make sense for the U.S. to take it up a notch and attack the actual servers that are used?</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Yes.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, what are the consequences for Putin if he does not step up against cyberattacks?</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Well, we set up a committee &#8212; joint committee.&nbsp; They’re meeting on, I think, the 16th.&nbsp; And I believe we’re going to get some cooperation.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. President, what do you expect President Putin (inaudible) &#8212; what do you expect him to do?&nbsp; What are those actions?</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; It’s not appropriate for me to say what I expect him to do now.&nbsp; But we’ll see.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p class="has-text-align-center">Via Teleconference</p>



<p>3:25 P.M. EDT</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MODERATOR:&nbsp; Good afternoon, everyone.&nbsp; Today&#8217;s call is going to be on background, attributed to a “senior administration official,” and the contents are going to be embargoed until the conclusion of the call.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With that, we&#8217;ll turn it over to our speaker, [senior administration official].&nbsp; [Senior administration official], over to you.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; And thanks, everybody, for being here.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were two main topics, obviously, in the President&#8217;s call today with President Putin.&nbsp; First, Syria &#8212; which I really want to underscore because I think it deserves some attention.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I really &#8212; the leaders commended the work of their respective teams following the U.S.-Russia summit that led to today&#8217;s unanimous renewal of cross-border humanitarian assistance to Syria in the U.N. Security Council.&nbsp; And I genuinely encourage you to reach out to NGOs and other humanitarian organizations about the impact of this.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For months, we&#8217;ve been concerned about the likelihood, if not a near certainty, of a Russian veto of the U.N. Security Council resolution that allows for humanitarian assistance to be provided across the Syrian border from Turkey.&nbsp; And it is our strong sense that only leader-level engagement along the lines that took place at the summit in Geneva would have gotten this extension done and this access secured at a time of severe humanitarian distress and need in Syria.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, we think that&#8217;s quite a consequential action and a genuine impact of the President&#8217;s personal engagement and of the summit.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; President Biden also spoke with President Putin, obviously, about the ongoing ransomware attacks by criminals based in Russia that have impacted the United States and other countries around the world.&nbsp; President Biden underscored the need for Russia to take action to disrupt ransomware groups operating on Russian territory, and emphasized that he&#8217;s committed to continued engagements on the broader threat posed by ransomware.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The President believes strongly in this leader-level engagement on this issue as well.&nbsp; And we engage in this type of diplomacy not because we agree often or all the time, but precisely because we have these disagreements in so many areas, including this one.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; President Biden reiterated that the United States will take necessary action to defend its people and its critical infrastructure in the face of this continuing challenge.&nbsp; And the President has also called on governments and agencies to modernize their defenses to meet this threat, building on the President&#8217;s executive order on cybersecurity that was released in May.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to say a few other things about this: The President really meant what he said just after concluding the summit meeting in Geneva, when he said that our assessment of this process and our evaluation of Russia&#8217;s actions would take time and play out over time.&nbsp; The President said six months or more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is more than just a conversation that’s taking place between the two leaders, President Biden and President Putin.&nbsp; This is really about our own resilience, as a nation, in the face of these attacks, and strengthening that.&nbsp; That&#8217;s what the cybersecurity executive order was largely about.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s about addressing the challenges posed by cryptocurrency, which provides fuel for these sorts of transactions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s about ensuring that our allies and our partners are working with us, collaboratively, and upping their own game when it comes to resilience and these broader issues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, this is a broad campaign and won&#8217;t have an immediate on-off effect like a light switch, but we’re going to have to stay on top of this over a period of time and remain focused on it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, with that, [senior administration official], I’m happy to take whatever questions there are.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Syria, you mentioned we should call NGO groups, and we have.&nbsp; And they say that this isn&#8217;t good enough, that six-month extension; even if there&#8217;s no requirement for another vote &#8212; in six months, it’s just not long enough to plan for humanitarian groups.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Human Rights Watch said that Russia successfully blackmailed the international community.&nbsp; Amnesty said Russia continues to play games with the lives and welfare of millions of people.&nbsp; So how do you paint this as a success if these groups are saying it&#8217;s not?&nbsp;</p>



<p>And on cyber, the U.S. has given Russia information on the people it wants arrested.&nbsp; Assuming Russia has not made those arrests, how is it that you can expect Russian action when you&#8217;ve asked for those actions and they haven&#8217;t been taken?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Thank, Nick.&nbsp; So, first of all, this was a 15 to 0 vote in the Security Council, broadly, strongly believed by the United States and our closest allies that this was a big step forward on the humanitarian front.&nbsp; And the groups that we&#8217;ve been in touch with have a different impression from the ones that you&#8217;ve just quoted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We see the six-month extension with a virtually automatic additional six months.&nbsp; In other words, adding up to a full-year extension of humanitarian access is being far better than what was expected in recent months and consider this to be a significant progress on the humanitarian issues.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re going to have to stay on top of them, obviously.</p>



<p>On Russia’s follow-up actions: Look, you know, time will tell.&nbsp; The President was quite clear that part of why he wanted to gauge what President Putin was willing to do with regard to these actions that have taken place from Russian territory was so the United States could gauge what we&#8217;re going to be willing to do.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I think the President was asked today if he expected us, the United States, to take action, to follow up.&nbsp; He said, “Yes.”&nbsp; We&#8217;re not going to telegraph what those actions will be precisely.&nbsp; Some of them will be manifest and visible, some of them may not be.&nbsp; But we expect those to take place, you know, in the days and weeks ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi there.&nbsp; Thank you for doing this.&nbsp; What did Russia get in exchange for not voting to close the crossing into Syria?</p>



<p>And as far as the timing, did the administration wait until Russia did vote that way before making this, kind of, more punitive call on ransomware?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; So, on your second question: No &#8212; I mean, I think the timing of these two topics was more coincidental than linked.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t think we linked these issues in any way.</p>



<p>On your first question, I guess I would refer you to the Russian government to explain its rationale and its calculus for this vote.&nbsp; I mean, for our purposes, you know, what we were concerned about was the continued, sustained, and ideally enhanced flow of humanitarian assistance into all parts of Syria, and we think that&#8217;s what this has accomplished.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey, this is actually Rachel Scott with ABC.&nbsp; We&#8217;re just in the booth together.&nbsp; Thanks so much for taking my question.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The President was just asked (inaudible) servers that are used to carry out ransomware hacks.&nbsp; So, my first question is: Has the President already directed officials to do that?&nbsp;</p>



<p>And just another follow-up question.&nbsp; We just got a readout from the Kremlin.&nbsp; They say that they&#8217;ve received no formal request to assist in dealing with the attacks from U.S. agencies.&nbsp; What is the administration&#8217;s response to that?&nbsp; Is there any indication that they&#8217;re taking (inaudible) this morning?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Sorry.&nbsp; Can &#8212; the very first part of your question got garbled.&nbsp; Has the President directed agencies and departments to do what specifically, did you ask?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; (Inaudible) now, given &#8212;</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; You&#8217;re still &#8212; you&#8217;re still really breaking up, so &#8212; I’m sorry.&nbsp; I&#8217;m &#8212; maybe, Operator, you can hear this, but I can&#8217;t.</p>



<p>OPERATOR:&nbsp; It&#8217;s breaking up on my end as well.&nbsp; Molly, can you hear us?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you hear me?</p>



<p>OPERTATOR:&nbsp; Your line was breaking up.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah, I can &#8212; I&#8217;ll ask it again.&nbsp; I’m walking out of the booth.&nbsp; Sorry, stick with me (inaudible).</p>



<p>So, the President was just asked on the tarmac if it makes sense to attack the servers that are used to carry out the ransomware hacks.&nbsp; The President said, “Yes.”&nbsp; So, my question is: Has he &#8212; has he planned to direct &#8212; have you already directed any officials to carry out that action?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; So &#8212; okay, I guess I&#8217;ll take the two parts of your question.&nbsp; On the first question, that&#8217;s obviously not something that we would speak to publicly, in terms of any specific actions the President has or hasn&#8217;t ordered.&nbsp; So I just won&#8217;t speak to those operational questions in detail.</p>



<p>On your second question about the Kremlin&#8217;s readout, I guess what I can say is that we have relayed multiple specific requests for action on cybercriminals to Russia through official channels and been clear about what Russia&#8217;s responsibility is with regard to taking action, including, again, today, at the level of the two presidents.&nbsp; And I’ll just leave it at that.</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Hey, everyone.&nbsp; This is [senior administration officials].&nbsp; Just on that &#8212; on that first part of that last question, I would encourage folks to go back and look at the full official transcript of what the President said earlier.&nbsp; I think that there might be a bit of a garble there, but folks should be checking the transcript, please.</p>



<p>With that, I&#8217;m afraid that we&#8217;re out of time, and we have to get our speaker to his next meeting.&nbsp; Thanks, everyone, for joining, and have a good rest of your afternoon.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3:36 P.M. EDT</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">State Dining&nbsp;Room&nbsp;</p>



<p>1:48&nbsp;P.M. EDT&nbsp;</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Hello, everyone.&nbsp; They have a Cabinet meeting.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Please &#8212; please be seated.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>Well, it is not “good morning,” which my remarks say here, but &#8212; (laughter) &#8212; good afternoon.&nbsp; We&#8217;re in the midst of a historic economic recovery.&nbsp; And because our successful vaccination program strategy has been working and the immediate relief through the American Rescue Plan has brought back our economy from the worst economic crisis in nearly a century, America is now on track.&nbsp; We&#8217;re now on track for the highest economic growth in 40 years and among the highest growth records on record.</p>



<p>We designed our ecomi- &#8212; our economic strategy to be durable through the ups and downs that come with recovery.&nbsp; And there are ups and downs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That&#8217;s why the American Rescue Plan was designed to help people not just all at once, but over the course of a full year so we could continue supporting families, small businesses, state and local budgets to help them weather those ups and downs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And now that the economy is back on track, we&#8217;re making progress on the second phase of our strategy: ensuring long-term growth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That&#8217;s what my Build Back Better agenda, including my Americans Family Plan and the bipartisan infrastructure agreement we reached last month &#8212; that&#8217;s what they&#8217;re all about: long term.</p>



<p>But to keep our country moving, we have to take another step as well &#8212; and I know you&#8217;re all tired of hearing me during the campaign and since I&#8217;m elected President talk about it &#8212; and that&#8217;s bringing fair competition back to the economy.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s why today I&#8217;m going to be signing shortly an executive order promoting competition to lower price &#8212; to lower prices, to increase wages, and to take another critical step toward an economy that works for everybody.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The heart of American capitalism is a simple idea: open and fair competition &#8212; that means that if your companies want to win your business, they have to go out and they have to up their game; better prices and services; new ideas and products.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That competition keeps the economy moving and keeps it growing.&nbsp; Fair competition is why capitalism has been the world&#8217;s greatest force for prosperity and growth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By the same token, “competitive economy” means companies must do all they do to do &#8212; everything they do to compete for workers: offering higher wages, more flexible hours, better benefits.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But what we&#8217;ve seen over the past few decades is less competition and more concentration that holds our economy back.&nbsp; We see it in big agriculture, in big tech, in big pharma.&nbsp; The list goes on.</p>



<p>Rather than competing for consumers, they are consuming their competitors.&nbsp; Rather than competing for workers, they&#8217;re finding ways to gain the upper hand on labor.&nbsp; And too often, the government has actually made it harder for new companies to break in and compete.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Look at what that means for family budgets.&nbsp; Take prescription drugs: Just a handful of companies control the market for many vital medicines, giving them leverage over everyone else to charge whatever they want.&nbsp; As a result, Americans pay two and a half times more for prescription drugs than in any other leading country.&nbsp; And nearly one in four Americans struggles to afford their medication.</p>



<p>Another example: hearing aids.&nbsp; Right now, if you need a hearing aid, you can&#8217;t just walk into a pharmacy and pick one up over the counter.&nbsp; You have to get it from a doctor or a specialist.&nbsp; Not only does that make getting hearing aids inconvenient, it makes them considerably more expensive, and it makes it harder for new companies to compete, innovate, and sell hearing aids at lower prices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a result, a pair &#8212; a pair of hea- &#8212; a pair of hearing aids can cost thousands of dollars.&nbsp; That&#8217;s a big reason why just one in seven Americans with hearing loss actually use a hearing aid.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another example: Internet services.&nbsp; There are more than 65 million Americans who live in a place with only one high-speed Internet provider.&nbsp; Research shows, when you have unlimited Internet operation, you pay up to five times more on average than families in places with more choices.&nbsp; That&#8217;s what a lack of competition does: it raises the prices you pay.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And it&#8217;s not just consumers getting hurt.&nbsp; Big ag is putting a squeeze on farmers.&nbsp; Small and family farms, first-time farmers &#8212; like veterans coming home and Black and Latino and Indigenous farmers &#8212; they&#8217;re seeing price hikes for seed, lopsided contracts, shrinking profits, and growing debt.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lack of competition hurts workers as well.&nbsp; In many communities, there are only a handful of employers left competing for workers.&nbsp; Think of company towns across Appalachia and other parts of the country where one big corporation runs the show.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When corporations have that kind of leverage over workers, it pushes down aver- &#8212; it pushes down advertised wages by up to 17 percent.&nbsp; And as competition decreases, businesses don&#8217;t feel the pressure to innovate or invest in their workforce.&nbsp; That hurts working families and it hurts our economy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All told, between rising prices and lowering wages, lack of competition costs the median American household $5,000 a year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, look, I&#8217;m a proud capitalist.&nbsp; I spent most of my career representing the corporate state of Delaware.&nbsp; I know America can’t succeed unless American business succeeds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But let me be very clear: Capitalism without competition isn&#8217;t capitalism; it’s exploitation.&nbsp; Without healthy competition, big players can change and charge whatever they want and treat you however they want.&nbsp; And for too many Americans, that means accepting a bad deal for things that can&#8217;t go &#8212; you can&#8217;t go without.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, we know we&#8217;ve got a problem &#8212; a major problem.&nbsp; But we also have an incredible opportunity.&nbsp; We can bring back more competition to more of the country, helping entrepreneurs and small businesses get in the game, helping workers get a better deal, helping families save money every month.&nbsp; The good news is: We&#8217;ve done it before.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the early 1900s, President Teddy Roosevelt saw an economy dominated by giants like Standard Oil and JP Morgan&#8217;s railroads.&nbsp; He took them on, and he won.&nbsp; And he gave the little guy a fighting chance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Decades later, during the Great Depression, his cousin Franklin Roosevelt saw a wave of corporate mergers that wiped out sec- &#8212; scores of small businesses, crushing competition and innovation.&nbsp; So he ramped up antitrust enforcement eightfold in just two years, saving families billions in today&#8217;s dollars and helping to set the course for sustained economic growth after World War Two.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He also called for an economic bill of rights, including, quote, “the right of every businessman, large and small, to trade in an atmosphere of freedom from unfair competition and domination by monopolies.”&nbsp; End of quote.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Between them, the two Roosevelts established an American tradition &#8212; an antitrust tradition.&nbsp; It is how we ensure that our economy isn&#8217;t about people working for capitalism; it&#8217;s about capitalism working for people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, over time, we&#8217;ve lost the fundamental American idea that true capitalism depends on fair and open competition.&nbsp; Forty years ago, we chose the wrong path, in my view, following the misguided philosophy of people like Robert Bork, and pulled back on enforcing laws to promote competition.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We&#8217;re now 40 years into the experiment of letting giant corporations accumulate more and more power.&nbsp; And where- &#8212; what have we gotten from it?&nbsp; Less growth, weakened investment, fewer small businesses.&nbsp; Too many Americans who feel left behind.&nbsp; Too many people who are poorer than their parents.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe the experiment failed.&nbsp; We have to get back to an economy that grows from the bottom up and the middle out.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The executive order I&#8217;m soon going to be signing commits the federal government to full and aggressive enforcement of our antitrust laws.&nbsp; No more tolerance for abusive actions by monopolies.&nbsp; No more bad mergers that lead to mass layoffs, higher prices, fewer options for workers and consumers alike.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My executive order includes 72 specific actions.&nbsp; I expect the federal agencies &#8212; and they know this &#8212; to help restore competition so that we have lower prices, higher wages, more money, more options, and more convenience for the American people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, I want to focus on three specific actions:&nbsp;</p>



<p>First, the FDA &#8212; the Food and Drug Administration &#8212; are going to work with states and Tribes to safely import prescription drugs from Canada.&nbsp; That&#8217;s just one of many actions in the executive order that will lower prescription drug prices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, the FDA is going to issue rules so that hearing aids can be sold over the counter.&nbsp; That&#8217;s something the last administration was supposed to have done but didn&#8217;t do.&nbsp; We&#8217;re going to get it done.&nbsp; After these rules go into effect, a pair of hearing aids can cost hundreds of dollars, not thousands.&nbsp; And you&#8217;ll be able to pick them up at your local drugstore.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, we&#8217;re going to improve competition for workers.&nbsp; I’ve talked a lot about non-compete agreements &#8212; contracts that say you can&#8217;t take another job in your field, even if you get a better deal.&nbsp; I made a speech &#8212; I was just reminiscing with my staff &#8212; back in 2018, at the Brookings Institution, where I talked about the non-compete clauses that were just &#8212; I found &#8212; to be absolutely ridiculous, but how prevalent they were throughout industries.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At least one in three businesses require their workers to sign a non-compete agreement.&nbsp; These aren’t just high-paid executives or scientists who hold secret formulas for Coca-Cola so Pepsi can’t get their hands on it.&nbsp; A recent study found one in five workers without a college education is subject to non-compete agreements.&nbsp; They’re construction workers, hotel workers, disproportionately women and women of color.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Think of the 26-year-old employee at a company.&nbsp; She’s a star worker, but she isn&#8217;t being treated right.&nbsp; She&#8217;s underpaid, passed over for promotions.&nbsp; A competitor across the street knows and wants to bring her in at a higher wage, but she can’t do it.&nbsp; Her company threatens legal action over a non-compete clause she had to sign in order to get hired in the first place.&nbsp; She can&#8217;t afford a lawyer for help, so she’s locked in.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Imagine if you’re in her shoes.&nbsp; You’d feel powerless, disrespected, bullied, trapped.&nbsp; That&#8217;s not right.&nbsp; Workers should be free to take a better job if someone offers it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If your employer wants to keep you, he or she should have to make it worth your while to stay.&nbsp; That&#8217;s the kind of competition that leads to better wages and greater dignity of work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Look, I&#8217;m not going to go into it now, but I used to talk about, you know, there&#8217;s non-compete clauses of people running the machines that lay down asphalt.&nbsp; If, in fact, you get offered a job and you have a &#8212; you know, you&#8217;re in Arkansas doing it, a lot of &#8212; a specific example is you can’t take a job in west Texas to do it.&nbsp; What in the hell does that have to do with anything?&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; No, I’m serious.&nbsp; Or there were clauses in McDonald&#8217;s contracts: You can&#8217;t leave Burger King to go to McDonald&#8217;s.&nbsp; Come on.&nbsp; Is there a trade secret about what&#8217;s inside that patty?&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; No, but I’m serious.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You all &#8212; I don&#8217;t know if you do know; I didn&#8217;t know it until five years ago &#8212; the incredible number of non-compete clauses for ordinary people who &#8212; it was done for one reason: to keep wages low.&nbsp; Period.</p>



<p>Look, my executive order calls on the FTC to ban or limit non-compete agreements.&nbsp; Let workers chose who they want to work for.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I’m also calling on the FTC to do away with certain occupational licensing requirements.&nbsp; You realize, if you want to braid hair and you move from one state to another, sometimes you have to do a six-month apprenticeship, even though you’ve been in the business for a long, long time?&nbsp; What the hell &#8212; what’s that all about?</p>



<p>Military families, for example, they’re often on the move between states with each new assignment.&nbsp; So you have a woman in the military, her husband is following her, or vice versa.&nbsp; Guess what?&nbsp; If you have &#8212; if you’re a plumber, you have to get a different license when you move from Delaware to Missouri.</p>



<p>Look, it can&#8217;t be a significant burden to get a new license in a new home state.&nbsp; That burden can&#8217;t be around anymore.&nbsp; It takes time and it takes money.&nbsp; It takes a toll on a family’s income while you&#8217;re waiting.&nbsp; We should remove that barrier, providing more mobility, more opportunity, higher wages for families on the move.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is something that my wife, Jill, has worked on together with Michelle Obama through the Joining Forces initiative for the military.</p>



<p>We’re going to keep that moving.&nbsp; We’re going to get it done in an executive order.</p>



<p>Let me close with this: Competition works.&nbsp; We know it works.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve seen it works when it exists.&nbsp; Fair competition is was what made America the wealthiest, most innovative nation in history.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why people come here to invent things and start new businesses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the competition against China and other nations of the 21st century, let&#8217;s show that American democracy and the American people can truly outcompete anyone.&nbsp; Because I know that just given half a chance, the American people will never, ever, ever let their country down.&nbsp; Imagine if we give everyone a full and fair chance.&nbsp; That’s what this is all about.&nbsp; That’s what I’m about to do.</p>



<p>So I’d like to invite the Cabinet members up here.&nbsp; I’d like to &#8212; and the Attorney General is here &#8212; Attorney General Garland.&nbsp; Xavier &#8212; Mr. Secretary, you can come up too.&nbsp; I’ve been watching on television; you’ve been really good.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Gina Raimondo.&nbsp; Also, Pete Buttigieg.&nbsp; And the chair of the <s>FCC</s> [FTC], Lian [sic] &#8212; excuse me, Lina Khan, Acting Chair of the FTC.&nbsp; And Director of the National Economic Council.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Am I leaving anybody out?&nbsp; Anyway, come on up.&nbsp; This may be the first Cabinet meeting we’ve had.</p>



<p>Okay.&nbsp; “Promoting Competition in the American Economy.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>First pen.&nbsp; (Laughter.) &nbsp;Second pen.&nbsp; Third.&nbsp; Fourth.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Fifth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I’m wondering how Barack did this with a shorter name.&nbsp; (Laughter.)</p>



<p>(The executive order is signed.)</p>



<p>Thank you.&nbsp; Thank you, everyone.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. President, how did President Putin respond to your call today, sir?</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Well, I made it very clear to him that &#8212; that the United States expects, when a ransomware operation is coming from his soil, even though it’s not &#8212; not sponsored by the state, we expect them to act if we give them enough information to act on who that is.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, secondly, that we have set up a means of communications now, on a regular basis, to be able to communicate to one another when each of us thinks something is happening in another country that affects the home country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so, it went well.&nbsp; I’m optimistic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You said, three weeks ago, there would be consequences.&nbsp; Will there be, sir?</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Yes.</p>
