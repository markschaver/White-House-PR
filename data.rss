<p class="has-text-align-center">South Court Auditorium </p>



<p><br>1:57 P.M. EDT<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:  I&#8217;m Joe Biden.  I&#8217;m Jill&#8217;s husband.  (Laughter.) <br><br>Before I sign, let me start with a few words about what&#8217;s going on now in &#8212; in Florida.  And, you know, the people who are here, who were part of what happened that night at the Pulse nightclub and the scores that I just spoke to a moment ago &#8212; they&#8217;re online looking at this &#8212; they understand that &#8212; what it&#8217;s like to have to wait and wonder what happened. <br><br>The families &#8212; I remember going down there to the Pulse nightclub afterwards and &#8212; and wondering: &#8220;Is it my son, my daughter, my husband, someone I love &#8212; is that who got lost?&#8221;  Because you didn&#8217;t know for certain initially. <br><br>And as &#8212; as Congressman Cicilline knows, there&#8217;s nothing worse than having to wait and wonder what happened.  And I know, Val, when you were a police chief, you had to go through waiting a lot as well. <br><br>And so, I just want to say, I&#8217;ve spoken to Governor DeSantis.  And we&#8217;ve provided all the help that they have &#8212; they need.  We sent the best people from FEMA down there.  We&#8217;re going to stay with them; with the disaster declaration we made, provide for everything from housing to, God forbid, whether there&#8217;s a need for moratoria- &#8212; if there are &#8212; to &#8212; for the bodies to be placed.  Everything in between. <br><br>And &#8212; but I just &#8212; I just want to say &#8212; and I&#8217;m sure I speak for all the members of the Congress here today and all the survivors here that &#8212; that it&#8217;s a tough, tough time.  There&#8217;s so many people waiting.  &#8220;Are they alive?  Will they be &#8212; what will happen?&#8221;  And so, our heart goes out to them. <br><br>And I &#8212; to the people of Florida, I want to &#8212; I&#8217;ve spoken to Debbie Wasserman Schultz.  I&#8217;ve spoken to most of the folks down there and member &#8212; in authority.  And I promise you, the administration, the Congress &#8212; we&#8217;re doing everything possible to be of assistance now and after this occurs &#8212; after they decide exactly what the state of play is.<br><br>But I&#8217;m glad to welcome everyone here to the adjunct to the White House here, and in person and virtually: survivors and family members, victims, and the path-breaking leaders like Senator Baldwin. <br><br>Just over five years ago, the Pulse nightclub, a place of acceptance and joy, became a place of unspeakable pain and loss.  And we&#8217;ll never fully recovery, but we&#8217;ll remember.  And we have to &#8212; what we&#8217;re going to do is what the members of Congress here did, and enshrine in law &#8212; as a consequence of that law, enshrine, in perpetuity, literally a monument to the loss that occurred there, and an absolute determination that we&#8217;re going to deal with this every single, solitary day and make sure that we&#8217;re not in a position to see this happen again. <br><br>Behind me, you see, on either board there, the 49 lives lost: family members, parents, friends, veterans, students, young, Black, Asian, Latino &#8212; all fellow Americans.  And in their memory and for the countless others forever scarred is why I sign this today. <br><br>And let me say how much I appreciate it &#8212; and I mean this sincerely &#8212; the &#8212; the commitment of the members of the House and Senate to make sure that we don&#8217;t forget &#8212; that this isn&#8217;t forgotten. <br><br>Now, there&#8217;s a tradition when a bill is signed that the President gives a signing pen to each of the people who had something to do with the law or the decision being made in the first place. <br><br>I promise you, I have all the pens, but they&#8217;re in the other room.  I couldn&#8217;t figure how to sign &#8212; (laughter) &#8212; sign them all.  But don&#8217;t leave without the pen.  Okay?  All right?  All right. <br><br>REPRESENTATIVE TAKANO:  Thank you, Mr. President.</p>



<p>REPRESENTATIVE SOTO:  Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:  (The bill is signed.) <br><br>May we never have to sign another &#8212; no President ever have to sign another monument like this.  (Applause.)  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you. <br><br>And one last thing, as I said to &#8212; to the survivors and their &#8212; those who lost folks, a little earlier, in private: You know, what the Congress has done means a great deal, and it&#8217;s important.  But it&#8217;s really hard; it brings back everything as if it happened yesterday. <br><br>And every time there&#8217;s a memorial service for our son, Beau, you know, you&#8217;re flattered.  You feel good about it.  You think it&#8217;s wonderful &#8212; the recognition.  But it&#8217;s a &#8212; it&#8217;s tough.  It&#8217;s as if it happened yesterday, it happened the day before, it happened the moment you&#8217;re signing it. <br><br>So, I want to thank the folks who are here and the folks who are survivors who are on Zoom with us.  I want to thank them for their courage &#8212; I really mean it &#8212; for their courage. <br><br>But, I promise you, none of the members of Congress that are here, nor I, nor Jill are going to let up until we deal with equity across the board. <br><br>Thank you so very much.  (Applause.)<br><br>PARTICIPANT:  Thank you, Mr. President.  It means so much to us. <br><br>THE PRESIDENT:  And you&#8217;ve got to come back and get your pens.  (Laughter.) <br><br>2:03 P.M. EDT</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">James S. Brady Press Briefing Room</p>



<p>12:52 P.M. EDT<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Hi everyone.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hello, Jen.&nbsp; Good to see you.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Good to see you.&nbsp; Happy Pride.&nbsp; Celebrating here today.<br>&nbsp;<br>Okay.&nbsp; I&#8217;m just going to give you a quick overview of the week ahead: On Monday, the President will welcome Israeli President Rivlin to the White House.&nbsp; President Rivlin’s visit will highlight the enduring partnership between the United States and Israel and the deep ties between our governments and our people.&nbsp; As President Rivlin approaches the end of his term, the visit will honor the dedication he has shown to strengthening the friendship between the two countries over the course of many years.<br>&nbsp;<br>On Tuesday, the President will travel to Southwest Wisconsin with Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack to talk about growing agriculture &#8212; growing agriculture and rural economies.<br>&nbsp;<br>On Wednesday, he will convene Cabinet officials, governors from western states, and private sector partners to discuss the devastating intersection of drought, heat, and wildfires in the Western United States, and strengthening prevention, preparedness, and response efforts for this wildfire season, which is already outpacing last season alone &#8212; outpacing last season alone &#8212; sorry &#8212; the 2020 wildfire season alone burned over 10 million acres across the United States, resulting in the loss of dozens of lives and tens of billions of dollars in economic damage.&nbsp; This meeting will focus on how the federal government can most effectively protect public safety and deliver assistance to our people in times of urgent need.<br>&nbsp;<br>And, on Friday, the President will also deliver remarks on the June jobs report.<br>&nbsp;<br>Next week, even while all of this is going on &#8212; a busy week &#8212; the President will also continue to work and engage closely with members of Congress about moving his agenda forward, whether it&#8217;s the bipartisan infrastructure agreement just announced yesterday or the budget reconciliation process that&#8217;s also moving forward.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And he will continue to &#8212; on his work to protect the sacred right to vote.&nbsp; You&#8217;ll hear from him next week on that.&nbsp; We&#8217;re still finalizing the details, and he&#8217;s been engaged in that work through his career, so you&#8217;ll hear more from him on that next week.<br>&nbsp;<br>I&#8217;d also note, so I don&#8217;t forget: Today is Jerome&#8217;s last day in the White House Briefing Room as a White House correspondent.&nbsp; So thank you &#8212; to your service to the public over the last several years.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br>&nbsp;<br>All right.&nbsp;&nbsp; Why don&#8217;t we kick it off, Darlene.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.&nbsp; Is the infrastructure agreement already stuck in a pothole?&nbsp; (Laughter.)<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; You worked hard on that.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No, I didn&#8217;t.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t.&nbsp; (Laughter.)<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I like it.<br>&nbsp;<br>Absolutely not, in our view.&nbsp; The President is continuing to, as I said &#8212; as he said yesterday, there&#8217;s work ahead.&nbsp; There&#8217;s no question about that.<br>&nbsp;<br>But yesterday was a significant moment when you saw Democrats and Republicans and the President of the United States stand outside together and say, &#8220;We&#8217;ve come to agreement to pa- &#8212; to work for &#8212; toward passing a historic investment in infrastructure, one that would have…&#8221; &#8212; I just have this handy chart up here; I thought someone might ask about this &#8212; &#8220;…would have key components that would help communities across the country.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;<br>And I talked with him about this, this morning: what he was most excited about, what he&#8217;s going to continue, what his message is going to be as he continues to advocate for this bill moving forward.<br>&nbsp;<br>One is the significant economic impact.&nbsp; It&#8217;s going to help create millions of good-paying union jobs that will also have a huge impact on low-income communities, on communities of color.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>It will eliminate lead pipes to stop kids from drinking poisoned water.&nbsp; Flint, Michigan, should not be so far away that we don&#8217;t remember the impact on that community.&nbsp; This is a &#8212; part of this package will help prevent that from ever happening again.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>It includes the single-largest investment in environmental remediation in history.&nbsp; What does that mean?&nbsp; A lot of people at home don&#8217;t know what that means, so I&#8217;m going to explain it.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s 100 percent of what he asked for.&nbsp; It means cleaning up pollution in communities that have disproportionately borne the brunt of environmental pollution.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a capping &#8212; it also means capping wells where big oil companies left wells uncapped with methane pouring out.&nbsp; It means putting people back to work to do the work we need to do to help create a clean energy economy for the long term.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And it has the largest investment in public transit in our nation&#8217;s history.&nbsp; We know this will also have an enormous impact on low-income communities &#8212; many communities of color.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>I&#8217;ll also note: There are huge components of this package that will help address the climate crisis.&nbsp; One is the first-ever &#8212; first-ever network &#8212; first time we&#8217;ve ever invested &#8211;sorry &#8212; in a network of EV charging stations across the country.&nbsp; So electric vehicles &#8212; I don&#8217;t currently own one; maybe I will in the future.&nbsp; Who knows.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>It will make it easier &#8212; there will be more charging stations so people can use them across the country.&nbsp; It will have the largest investment in history in a clean energy transmission grid &#8212; something that will also help us take a huge step forward.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And this bill also will help us &#8212; and this the piece he talked about yesterday, but he is particularly excited about &#8212; make us more competitive in the world.&nbsp; And a specific example there is making sure we are building our battery industry here in the United States to compete globally.<br>&nbsp;<br>So that&#8217;s the case he&#8217;s making, he&#8217;s going to continue to make.&nbsp; There&#8217;s no question there&#8217;s work ahead, and he&#8217;s ready to roll up his sleeves and work like hell to get it done.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But we&#8217;re hearing from the Hill, from a lot of senators, that &#8212; unhappiness over the President&#8217;s decision to want to do both these packages at the same time &#8212; the pairing, moving them in tandem.&nbsp; When senators agreed to this deal, was the White House upfront with them that this was the way the President wanted to proceed?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, first, you all have heard the President say multiple times, publicly, that he wanted to &#8212; he was going to move these bills forward &#8212; wanted to move them forward in parallel paths.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s exactly what&#8217;s happening.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>That hasn&#8217;t been a secret.&nbsp; He hasn&#8217;t said it quietly.&nbsp; He hasn&#8217;t even whispered it.&nbsp; He said it very much out loud to all of you, as we have said many times from here.<br>&nbsp;<br>I will say that the President&#8217;s view is that the public &#8212; the American people &#8212; elected him to not lead on process, but to get things done.&nbsp; The House and Senate are going to determine &#8211; the Leaders in the House and Senate are going to determine the sequencing, the timeline.&nbsp; And he looks forward to signing both pieces of legislation.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One other quick one.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the plan for what &#8212; will we get a statement from the President after the &#8212;&nbsp; Derek Chauvin is sentenced?&nbsp; Do you expect the President will call George Floyd&#8217;s family &#8212; be in touch with them after the sentence is announced?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; It&#8217;s a great question, Darlene.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t &#8212; I don&#8217;t have any anticipat- &#8212; I don&#8217;t have anything to preview for you.&nbsp; I guess I should say, at this point, we&#8217;ll wait for the sentencing to come out.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>As you know, he has a close personal connection with the Floyd family, and certainly I know they and we are all watching this closely.<br>&nbsp;<br>Go ahead.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; Does the President have any plans to visit Surfside to see the devastation for himself?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would say, first, that any decision along those lines would be done in coordination and cooperation with local authorities.<br>&nbsp;<br>As you know &#8212; and you all have been covering this closely &#8212; right now, we&#8217;re in a rescue-and-recovery phase of this, and there have been frequent updates from local authorities on the ground.<br>&nbsp;<br>So I don&#8217;t have any trip to preview or predict for you at this point in time.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How did the Vice President choose El Paso as the location for her first trip to the border as Vice President?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; It&#8217;s a great question.&nbsp; I was &#8212; I was interested in that as well, so we looked into it.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>I would say that El Paso has an interesting history, as you may know, because it was the place where the former President, kind of &#8212; it was a base place of where he put in place some of his immigration policies that we felt were so problematic.<br>&nbsp;<br>And so, it&#8217;s a &#8212; it&#8217;s a place that has a little bit of historical connection in that regard, and it&#8217;s an opportunity to draw a bit of a contrast with what we&#8217;re trying to accomplish.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, can you give us any details about the three staffers in the Vice President&#8217;s office who are leaving?&nbsp; And what should we take from the fact that you have several key staffers who are leaving this early in the administration?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I just don&#8217;t have any more details on the circumstances of their departure.&nbsp; As you may know, these are sometimes high &#8212; high-stress jobs, tiring jobs, exhausting jobs.&nbsp; And &#8212; but I don&#8217;t have anything more specific on their decisions.<br>&nbsp;<br>Go ahead.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Following up on Surfside, if I can, very quickly: Obviously, no details about whether he plans to travel there.&nbsp; Has the President now spoken to Florida Governor Ron DeSantis about the circumstances there?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We&#8217;re working to set up a call between the President and the governor.&nbsp; That should be happening this afternoon, and we&#8217;ll give you all a readout of that when it happens.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We&#8217;ll wait for that readout when it happens.<br>&nbsp;<br>The President, yesterday, spoke about voting rights and what he would be doing.&nbsp; He said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll be going around the country, making the case.&#8221;&nbsp; So he announced it.&nbsp; What specifically is he doing?&nbsp; Where is he going?&nbsp; And what is that going to look like?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Stay tuned.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have any specific visits to announce for you yet, but this is going to be a fight of his presidency.&nbsp; He believes that voting is a fundamental right for the American people.&nbsp; He&#8217;s going to use every lever at his disposal to &#8212; to advocate for that.&nbsp; You&#8217;ll hear more from him next week as well.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The DOJ announcement today &#8212; that they would be filing this lawsuit against Georgia given what&#8217;s going on with their election law there &#8212; did the White House play a role in that?&nbsp; Did the President consult anybody?&nbsp; Does he have any thought on it?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We did not.&nbsp; That was a &#8212; that was an announcement they made on their own.&nbsp; But it certainly is consistent with the President&#8217;s commitment to the administration and the guidance he&#8217;s given, publicly and directly, to use every lever at our disposal to ensure we are protecting the fundamental right to vote across the country.<br>&nbsp;<br>Go ahead.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, on the timing of when the President is going to get out and advocate for voting rights &#8212; I mean, how soon can we see this?&nbsp; We&#8217;re hearing everyone from the Department of Justice to activists saying that this is really urgent issue.&nbsp; So how soon can we expect this?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, the President is going to speak to all of you and to the public next week about his continuing commitment to voting rights, expanding access to voting rights &#8212; something that he&#8217;s worked on for decades, through his public career.&nbsp; And I expect he&#8217;ll have more to say then.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then you could just follow up and maybe clarify: When the President is talking about doing these two pieces of legislation in tandem, is he going to wait for both of them to land on his desk?&nbsp; What &#8212; what exactly is the timeline here?&nbsp; How does this play out?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, again, he believes the American people elected him to lead on getting results to put out bold ideas to the public.&nbsp; That&#8217;s exactly what he&#8217;s done.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And we&#8217;re going to leave it to leaders in Congress to determine the sequencing and the timeline for those pieces moving forward.&nbsp; But he&#8217;s going to use every lever at his disposal, he&#8217;s going to be involved, he&#8217;s going to roll up his sleeves, he&#8217;s going to work like hell to get these &#8212; both of these pieces of legislation done.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But what does that really look like?&nbsp; Because he says that if one doesn&#8217;t come to him, he&#8217;s not going to sign the other.&nbsp; So is he going to wait for both of them to land on his desk before signing the bipartisan package, waiting for the reconciliation package to come through?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; He fully expects, hopes, plans to sign both into law.&nbsp; And he will leave it to leaders in Congress to determine the timeline and the sequencing.<br>&nbsp;<br>Go ahead.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just to follow up on both on that and Darlene&#8217;s question.&nbsp; The issue Republicans seem to be having is on that specific issue: &#8220;I won&#8217;t sign it if the other one isn&#8217;t on my desk.&#8221;&nbsp; And I think that&#8217;s what has them &#8212; &#8220;frazzled,&#8221; perhaps, would be the word right now &#8212; an eloquent one.<br>&nbsp;<br>So, digging in on that, if leadership decides to send you the bipartisan bill, but the reconciliation bill is not done yet, the President said yesterday, &#8220;I won&#8217;t sign it.&#8221;&nbsp; And that is the White House position on it?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, let me just take a step back here, because I think the American people are quite focused on how we&#8217;re getting work done on their behalf &#8212; less focused on the mechanics of the process.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Now, it is up to Republicans &#8212; many of whom are the ones who have conveyed that, I think &#8212; if I&#8217;m accurate here &#8212; to decide if they are going to vote against a historic investment in infrastructure that&#8217;s going to rebuild roads and railways and bridges in their communities simply because they don&#8217;t like the mechanics of the process.&nbsp; That&#8217;s a pretty absurd argument for them to make.&nbsp; Good luck on the political front on that argument.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So, the President is going to continue to advocate, educate, convey to everyone directly why this needs to move forward.&nbsp; And he stands &#8212; he plans to stand exactly by the commitment he made yesterday to them, and he expects they&#8217;ll do the same.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And just two more quick ones.&nbsp; You guys just released a readout with a call with Senator Sinema, who was one of the lead negotiators.&nbsp; In that readout, the President was reiterating pretty much all of the things he said when he was standing with the senators.&nbsp; Was there a need for the President to reassure Senator Sinema or was that just a normal scheduled call?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I think it&#8217;s just a reflection of the President&#8217;s commitment to stay very engaged.&nbsp; Yesterday was not the end.&nbsp; I know none of you thought that, but just to be clear: There is work ahead.&nbsp; Senator Sinema is a &#8212; was an important leader and partner on this effort to get this bipartisan bill passed.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>He also reiterated, in that call, his desire and his commitment and interest in getting a reconciliation bill passed.&nbsp; That has a lot of his key priorities, whether it&#8217;s extending the Child Tax Credit, making universal pre-K a reality, or community college a reality for kids across the country.<br>&nbsp;<br>So it&#8217;s ongoing engagement.&nbsp; He&#8217;s looking forward to signing both bills into law.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And can I just follow up on the &#8212; can I follow up &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Go ahead.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are Republicans expected to be so enamored with the idea of sending perhaps billions of dollars into the hinterland that they&#8217;re going to be willing &#8212; you need five more Republicans, obviously &#8212; that they&#8217;re going to be willing to accept this two-track approach and, sort of, look the other way when the express train comes through on the reconciliation idea?<br>&nbsp;<br>Are they &#8212; you &#8212; you&#8217;re sounding as though you expect at least five more Republicans to be so enamored with the idea of sending out these billions of dollars to their &#8212; the constituencies, if you will.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; Well, that&#8217;s exactly what they&#8217;re doing.&nbsp; This bill would, again, be a historic investment on our nation&#8217;s infrastructure: the largest investment in public transit in history, the largest in &#8212; since the founding of Amtrak.&nbsp; And as I&#8217;ve noted, it would expand broadband access.&nbsp; That&#8217;s not exactly a partisan issue.&nbsp; It would rebuild roads and railways and bridges in people&#8217;s communities, including Republicans.<br>&nbsp;<br>So, yes, we fully expect the American people to support this.&nbsp; We fully expect and hope we&#8217;ll have the votes to get it forward.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At least five?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; At least five.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Inaudible.)&nbsp; Okay.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, five stood &#8212; stood there yesterday and announced their support for it.&nbsp; And it is now the job of the Democratic Caucus and the Republican Caucus to vo- &#8212; go back and make the case to their &#8212; their other colleagues.&nbsp; Exactly.<br>&nbsp;<br>Go ahead.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.&nbsp; House Budget Committee Chairman John Yarmuth said he doesn&#8217;t think it&#8217;s realistic to fully pay for this broader reconciliation package that contains some of the President&#8217;s other domestic priorities that you just laid out.<br>&nbsp;<br>Senator Manchin also said he doesn&#8217;t think the country can take on that much more debt.&nbsp; So does the White House still believe that both the infrastructure compromise and this other reconciliation package need to be fully paid for?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; The President had proposed a number of ways to pay for these packages.&nbsp; Obviously, there was agreement already on the payfors for the infrastructure bipartisan deal, which was agreed to by the five Democrats and the five Republicans who stood outside with the President just yesterday.<br>&nbsp;<br>And the President also believes that raising the corporate rate back to where it was the first year of the George W. Bush administration; making &#8212; asking individuals, the top 1 percent of Americans to pay more &#8212; to pay for these historic investments, to pay for an extension of the Child Tax Credit, to make sure kids have access to universal pre-K &#8212; is something that we should do because it&#8217;s right &#8212; the right policy.&nbsp; It will also &#8212; it&#8217;s also going to help move our country forward.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And just one quick question on Afghanistan.&nbsp; Can the President declare a true end to the war if the U.S. is planning to keep 650 troops in the country to provide diplomatic security as well as several hundred additional troops to maintain security at the Kabul airport?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;Well, again, I would say: The President was clear from the beginning that we anticipated and planned to have a diplomatic presence on the ground. &nbsp;And so he&#8217;s doing exactly that.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I follow up on that, Jen?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Afghanistan &#8212; and then I have a follow-up on something else.&nbsp; But on Afghanistan: If we&#8217;re keeping people there, what&#8217;s the contingency if in fact the Taliban takes over the country?&nbsp; Do you have a contingency &#8212; does the administration have a contingency for that?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; In what regard?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, what will you do?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; For the safety of our &#8212; of our men and women serving &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No, I understand the safety, but &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; &#8212; in Kabul, or &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I understand the safety of our people, but what about the safety of the country?&nbsp; We&#8217;ve been there for X amount of years.&nbsp; Are we going to reinvest more people if that&#8217;s the case?&nbsp; Will there be boots on the ground?&nbsp; What exactly are &#8212; is this administration looking at if that country falls to the Taliban?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, here&#8217;s, I think, what&#8217;s important to note, Brian: When the President made this announcement, he was very clear that if we did not pull our troops &#8212; withdraw our troops from &#8212; from Afghanistan &#8212; something that he has long talked about having an interest and a desire to do &#8212; the Taliban would have been shooting at U.S. troops again on May 1st.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I understand.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; That&#8217;s a decision he had to make as President.&nbsp; So the withdrawal deadline negotiated &#8212; because of the withdrawal deadline negotiated, I should say, by the prior administration.&nbsp; So his fundamental belief is that after 20 years, it&#8217;s time to bring our troops home.<br>&nbsp;<br>We&#8217;re doing that in a timely and orderly fashion, led by the Department of Defense.&nbsp; And we had to make sure we were taking steps &#8212; if we had left our troops there, they would be in harm&#8217;s way.&nbsp; That was a step we had to take.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so, if the Taliban takes over, what would we do?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, again, we have &#8212; I&#8217;m not going to get ahead of or anticipate.&nbsp; We are &#8212; we have a range of capacities, including over-the-horizon capacities and capabilities that we will maintain in place.&nbsp; The President announced that at the beginning of his announcement.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then a follow-up &#8212; another quick follow-up.&nbsp; The other question is: Is this administration prepared for &#8212; we&#8217;ve heard rumblings from the former President and his supporters about August and the inevitability of him being reinstated.&nbsp; Is this administration prepared to meet the challenge if, in fact, they press that issue in August?&nbsp; I mean, we&#8217;ve already seen an insurrection.&nbsp; What would this administration&#8217;s actions be &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; The &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; if that &#8212; if that is pressed in August?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; The President is going &#8212; is prepared to continue to govern and lead the United States of America.&nbsp; And, of course, should there be an elevation, an escalation, you know, that is something we would certainly monitor and track as well.<br>&nbsp;<br>Go ahead, Jacqui.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q &nbsp;On reconciliation: Before the President made this statement yesterday, had there been any understanding between the President and the GOP senators who were negotiating that these two deals would come in tandem? &nbsp;Had the Republican senators expressed an understanding to the President that that would happen?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, Jacqui, I think the point I was trying to make earlier is that it&#8217;s something the President stated publicly many times.&nbsp; And certainly, he was consistent with that case, made privately, as were our negotiating team &#8212; that he expected, anticipated these &#8212; these initiatives would move forward on a dual track.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And I would also note that when we say &#8220;budget reconciliation&#8221; &#8212; just to make it like in “human speak” &#8212; what we&#8217;re talking about here is a budget process that includes the American Families Plan, which is the President&#8217;s idea he proposed.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t think anyone expects that he was going to walk away from his own proposals.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the Republicans had expressed an understanding &#8212; a level of understanding that that would happen?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I&#8217;m not going to let &#8212; I&#8217;ll let them speak for themselves.&nbsp; But, again, the President said this, as we did, multiple times publicly.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, on reconciliation &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What are the red lines and the must haves?&nbsp; And is the same team working with Congress &#8212; Ricchetti, Terrell, Deese &#8212; about the next steps in the reconciliation package?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, earlier this week &#8212; today&#8217;s Friday; I think it was Wednesday &#8212; we did have a number of those individuals you mentioned, as well as Susan Rice was a part of the team, and there may have been one or two other people, who went up to the Hill to talk about the budget reconciliation process.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>We&#8217;re obviously at the early stages of that.&nbsp; There&#8217;s lots to discuss and negotiate, including among Democrats.&nbsp; So we&#8217;ll let that proceed in the coming weeks.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then with the DOJ suing Georgia: Is this the beginning of more lawsuits against similar efforts in other states?&nbsp; Has the White House expressed any concern areas as they take on voting rights and initiatives like that?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I&#8217;ll let the &#8212; the Attorney General and the Department of Justice speak to that and what their plans are.&nbsp; They probably won&#8217;t preview them, I would expect.<br>&nbsp;<br>But I think it&#8217;s just a reflection of the fact that the President has conveyed his priority is using every lever at his disposal to protect the fundamental right of people in this country to vote.<br>&nbsp;<br>Go ahead.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, what&#8217;s your timeline for these two pieces of legislation?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have a new timeline to predict for you here, Steve.&nbsp; Again, we &#8212; Speaker Pelosi has been doing this a while; I don&#8217;t know that there&#8217;s anyone better.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re going to work with her, Leader Schumer, and others to make sure we get these bills signed into law.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And on the Afghanistan meeting, is the President going to talk about a negotiated political settlement?&nbsp; Is that still possible in Afghanistan?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; There &#8212; a political path forward is certainly one that we continue to support.&nbsp; We have a negotiator, as you well know, who, you know, is a &#8212; is monitoring and closely engaged in that process.&nbsp; And so that is certainly ongoing and will be a part of the agenda.<br>&nbsp;<br>Go ahead.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, thank you.&nbsp; On Afghanistan, in terms of SIV applicants &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; the President said yesterday, this would be a topic in the meeting today.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you provide clarity on what neutral locations these applicants will be moved towards?<br>&nbsp;<br>And then also, will that withdrawal include those who have already fled Afghanistan, because of a fear of retaliation, to places like Jordan or Egypt?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah, so let me give you information on where we are.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s unfortunately not going to answer every single question.&nbsp; Some of this we&#8217;re not going to be able to outline for security reasons.&nbsp; But we have identified a group of SIV applicants &#8212; Special Immigrant Visa applicants &#8212; who have served as interpreters and translators, as well as other at-risk categories, who have assisted us.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>They will be relocated to a location outside of Afghanistan before we complete our military drawdown, by September, in order to complete the visa application process.&nbsp; So they will do it from another location.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The additional details of that I&#8217;m just not going to be able to speak to from here.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did you say a number though on &#8212; on how &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have a number to outline for you.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s unlikely we will, because we are going to &#8212; those are the categories that we are prioritizing.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>I&#8217;d also note that these are individuals who are already in the SIV pipeline, and so we&#8217;d under &#8212; under &#8212; and of course we&#8217;d under &#8212; undertake any relocation in full compliance with U.S. law.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And just one &#8212; just a follow-up.&nbsp; I know I&#8217;ve asked about this a good amount, but for my colleagues as well.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We reported yesterday that the administration would lift Title 42 in a phased approach this summer.&nbsp; Does this summer look likely?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And here&#8217;s a new addition to that question: What will be the administration&#8217;s plan once that policy is lifted?&nbsp; Will it be centered on deterrence?&nbsp; Will it be prioritizing restoring the asylum system?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, first, I would say, on the second part, that, of course, we want to restore the asylum system and we want to make it more operational.&nbsp; We want to make it more humane.&nbsp; And there&#8217;s a lot of work we can &#8212; we need to do after the disaster of the last four years on this front.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>In terms of the timeline of Title 42 &#8212; I know I keep saying this to you, and I apologize it&#8217;s the same answer &#8212; but that is a decision that will be made by the CDC.&nbsp; I have nothing to preview for you in terms of the timeline.<br>&nbsp;<br>Go ahead, Karen.&nbsp; Go ahead.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, Georgia Governor Brian Kemp today accused the President and his allies of weaponizing the Justice Department to undermine election integrity.&nbsp; What&#8217;s the White House reaction to that?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;I would say: If you have such a fear of making it easier and more accessible for people to vote, then I would ask you what you&#8217;re so afraid of.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does the White House see the Justice Department as its only real way of going on offense against some of these sweeping efforts across the country to implement voting restrictions?&nbsp; That, as opposed to legislation right now?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; No, we don&#8217;t.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a good question.&nbsp; I mean, it is an area where, of course, the Attorney General and some of the &#8212; as you know, Kristen Clarke, Vanita Gupta &#8212; some of the highest-ranking officials in the Justice Department &#8212; the President nominated and pushed for their confirmation &#8212; have long records of advocacy, effectiveness, and work on these issues.&nbsp; So, he certainly entrusts them with the work they&#8217;re going to continue to do on this front.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>We are going to continue to fight for, battle for, work toward federal legislation.&nbsp; I know it does not seem easy at this time.&nbsp; Hard things &#8212; we do hard things; that&#8217;s what we do here.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>But we&#8217;re also going to continue to engage &#8212; and this is a &#8212; as it relates to an earlier question &#8212; with local activists, with local legislators.&nbsp; You&#8217;ve seen the Vice President do a bit of this &#8212; engage with and work with them.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>We&#8217;re going to &#8212; to fight this fight on many fronts.&nbsp; And certainly not &#8212; the role that the Attorney General and the Justice Department may decide to take is one, but there are a l- &#8212; a number of other ways the President, the Vice President, and our administration will be continuing to fight for voting rights.<br>&nbsp;<br>Go ahead.&nbsp; Go ahead, right in the middle.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q &nbsp;Today, on the anniversary of Shelby v. Holder, you have over 25 buses coming in between today and tomorrow on these Freedom Rides, being led by Black Voters Matter. &nbsp;Has anyone from the administration spoken with them? &nbsp;I know that they&#8217;re going to be holding a news conference later on today.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But have you reached out to them?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; That&#8217;s a great question.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll have to talk to our outreach team and some other senior members of the team to see if they had been engaged directly with them.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know off the &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And also, when it comes to the President trying to lower crime rate in the midst of this spike, there have been many reports showing that putting money &#8212; adding more money to police departments does not necessarily correlate with lowering crime.&nbsp; Why did the President decide to do that in &#8212; or instead of attaching it within the order to having the police departments do &#8212; have some type of system where they have to do something in order to receive that type of money?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, first, I would say that the President &#8212; and we saw some positive steps forward just yesterday on police reform in the negotiations; that&#8217;s certainly a positive step.&nbsp; The President believes we need to do both.&nbsp; And many &#8212; most people in most communities across the country where there&#8217;s rising crime agree.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And what the President announced just a couple of days ago, was a &#8212; primarily, a plan to reduce gun violence, which he feels is a big driver of violence across the country.&nbsp; But I would say, community policing and &#8212; is something that we&#8217;ve seen as effective, rebuilding trust in communities, ensuring that law enforcement are working on behalf of communities &#8212; that&#8217;s what he was proposing funding to go towards.&nbsp; That is different than a step &#8212; as it relates to the criminal justice system.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is he going to talk back about creating a police oversight commission?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I think a number of activists have conveyed that that is not their pri- &#8212; their preference for the path forward.&nbsp; They want to see this legislation move forward.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve seen some progress on that front, so that&#8217;s where we&#8217;re going to put ba- &#8212; the basket we&#8217;re going to put our eggs.<br>&nbsp;<br>Go ahead, in the middle.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; Now that Vice President Harris is visiting the border &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yes.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; as we speak, when will President Biden visit?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have anything to predict for you or preview for you.&nbsp; As the President has said &#8212; the Vice President said back in March, she&#8217;d be open to visiting the border.&nbsp; And if it&#8217;s constructive and moves the ball forward for the President to visit it, I&#8217;m sure he may.&nbsp; But we come with a bunch of people, as you all know.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On voting &#8212; on voting rights, I just &#8212; I just want to be clear: Are you saying that the White House had no contact with the Justice Department about this decision to move forward in Georgia?&nbsp; Is the Justice Department completely independent on this or is &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; No, I&#8217;m not &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; part of a White House agenda?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; It&#8217;s a &#8212; it&#8217;s a priority to the President.&nbsp; But &#8212; and, yes, of course we are wel- &#8212; allowed to know.&nbsp; But it is &#8212; I was not meaning to convey that.&nbsp; But it is a decision made by the Justice Department to move forward.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>But, clearly, a priority of the President to take action wherever we can in government to make it more accessible to vote for people across the country.<br>&nbsp;<br>Go ahead.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Let me go to her first, then I&#8217;ll go to you.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; When you talk about engaging at the state level &#8212; voting rights &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; what does that look like?&nbsp; Aside from travel, how will the administration be scrutinizing new laws going into place or &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, you saw the Department of Justice take an action today, that&#8217;s an example.&nbsp; But you&#8217;ve also seen the Vice President meet with legislators and work &#8212; and talk with them about the path forward and how we can work together to fight back against vote- &#8212; efforts to suppress the vote across the country.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So those are two examples.&nbsp; But, also, engaging with activists.&nbsp; I will say, there are a lot of people in this building who know a lot about how to engage, educate, empower people to know what their rights are.&nbsp; We want to work with states and local authorities to do exactly that.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>But the President will be talking about this more next week.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does the administration believe that&#8217;s making a difference in Republican-controlled state legislatures?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We&#8217;ll have to see.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Go ahead.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The President of Angola, President João Lourenço, was at the United Nations this week, and his main goal there &#8212; or his main focus was to &#8212; advocating to end the arms embargo that is going on on the Central &#8212; in the Central African Republic.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And President Lourenço is now the acting President of the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region.&nbsp; So he know the area.&nbsp; He have done a lot of work to bring peace and security in this region; that&#8217;s why he advocated strongly to end the embargo.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>But the United States wants to continue the embargo.&nbsp; Do you know what is the main reason?&nbsp; Or what &#8212; what is the interest of the United States to keep the embargo on the Central African Republic?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I’d really point you to our U.N. Ambassador, Linda Thomas-Greenfield; or the State Department for that question.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Go ahead.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I just have one more &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I think we have to move on.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Go ahead.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there any situation in which the President would sign the bipartisan infrastructure deal without an accompanying reconciliation bill?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; The President fully expects and plans to sign both pieces of legislation into law.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One other question &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Oh, go ahead.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The end of the Supreme Court term is next week.&nbsp; Does the President or the White House expect any retirements?&nbsp; And what would the message from the President be to a Justice who might be thinking about hanging up the robe?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; It&#8217;s a decision for them to make as an individual.&nbsp; And he would support whatever decision they make.<br>&nbsp;<br>Go ahead.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; President Biden met with financial regulators earlier this week.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Mm-hmm.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#8217;m wondering if there was any discussion about buy-now-pay-later companies &#8212; so like Klarna, Affirm, Afterpay.&nbsp; These are becoming very popular in the U.S. in retail transactions.&nbsp; And Europe recently made moves a few months back to regulate them.&nbsp; Is there anything you could tell me about that?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; You know, we&#8217;ve provided a readout of the meeting and what the focus of the meeting is &#8212; was &#8212; which was to provide an update on the state of the financial markets, to talk about how they can work to make credit more accessible.&nbsp; I just don&#8217;t have anything more to read out for you.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So no discussion &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; You could certainly &#8212; you could certainly reach out to any of the regulators if they want to speak about anything they raised.&nbsp; But I don&#8217;t have more of a readout from here.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; But no discussion from the White House then &#8212; on that then?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I would point you to the regulators.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have any more to read out from here.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Go ahead.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; The President is meeting shortly with President Ghani and Chairman Abdullah.&nbsp; They met yesterday with the Senate&#8217;s Minority Leader.&nbsp; And after that meeting, he called for a reversal of course by this administration to avoid a Taliban takeover of Afghanistan, contending that will give rise to renewed terrorism threats to the U.S. homeland. What is your response to Senator McConnell on that?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I would first say it’s important to take a step back and remember what we inherited.&nbsp; One, the lowest number of U.S. and partner forces in Afghanistan since the early days of the war.&nbsp; Two, an agreement between the United States and the Taliban to draw down all U.S. troops by May 1st, just three months after Inauguration Day &#8212; a very short timeline.&nbsp; And three, a military stalemate between the Taliban and Afghan forces.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>That&#8217;s the hand we were dealt.&nbsp; The President made a decision &#8212; which is consistent with his view that this was not a winnable war &#8212; to bring the U.S. troops home, some- &#8212; after 20 years of fighting this war.&nbsp; And a big part of that decision was also around the fact that if we left our troops there, our troops would be at risk because the Taliban would be shooting at them by May 1st.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>That&#8217;s the basis of it.&nbsp; Are there challenges to it?&nbsp; Of course.&nbsp; Will we continue to be engaged &#8212; as &#8212; as today is an &#8212; is evidence of &#8212; with the government about how we can continue to provide humanitarian security support?&nbsp; Yes, we will.&nbsp; Will we have a presence on the ground?&nbsp; Yes, we will.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>But that was a decision the President made with all of those factors involved.<br>&nbsp;<br>Go ahead.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Good to see you again.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Oh, hello, Goyal, how are you?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Good to see you again.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Good to see you.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quick two questions, please.&nbsp; One on U.S.-India relations, of course: Prime Minister Modi has spoken with President Biden a number of times.&nbsp; And have they &#8212; at the level of moving forward U.S.-India relations now between the two of them and where vaccine is concerned &#8212; where do we stand?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would say, Goyal, that the &#8212; India is an incredibly important partner to the United States in the region and globally.&nbsp; And we work with India on a range of issues, as you well know &#8212; economic, strategic, security.&nbsp; And the United States certainly took a range of steps, as India was at the early stages of dealing with a rise in the pandemic, to help provide a range of assistance, and we will continue to do that moving forward.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Go ahead.&nbsp; I&#8217;m sorry, Goyal.&nbsp; We got to &#8212; we got &#8212; we&#8217;re going to run out of time, so I just want to get to as many people as possible.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One more on the border thing.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Texas Governor Greg Abbott released a statement saying that he would have preferred the Vice President went to the Del Rio sector or the Rio Grande area.&nbsp; Any response to that?<br>&nbsp;<br>And secondly, was there any communication between the Vice President&#8217;s office that you can tell us about with the governor&#8217;s office about a potential meeting?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; A meeting with the governor?<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the Vice &#8212; between the Vice President and the governor.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I am happy to check with them and see if there was or if that was ever a part of &#8212; of the plans.&nbsp; And I&#8217;ll get back to you on that.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any response to his criticism about where she went today?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would say the purpose of the Vice President&#8217;s visit &#8212; as we&#8217;ve outlined &#8212; was to &#8212; she&#8217;s long said she would be open to visiting the border; she&#8217;s doing that with Secretary Mayorkas, who oversees the border and has helped lead a range of progress there that we&#8217;ve seen over the last couple of months.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And there certainly is a connection between the important work the Vice President is doing in the Northern Triangle, where we&#8217;ve also seen a reduction in migration of unaccompanied children since March and since April.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So that&#8217;s the purpose of their visit.&nbsp; In terms of direct consultation with the governor, I&#8217;m happy to check and see if there&#8217;s more I can read out for you.<br>&nbsp;<br>Go ahead in the middle, in the back.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah, go ahead.&nbsp; Go ahead.&nbsp; And then I&#8217;ll go to you, right in front of him.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the governor&#8217;s meeting with western governors next week: Can you tell us anything about which governors are invited, what we can expect to come out of that meeting?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, specifically, the President mentioned he was surprised at just how little federal wildland firefighters were paid.&nbsp; What would the administration do about that?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, one, we could pass a federal minimum wage, which would represent a higher wage than it seems the firefighters are getting. &nbsp;But, certainly, he will continue to advocate for additional support and assistance for the men and women serving as firefighters around the country.<br>&nbsp;<br>Let me give you a sense of the governors coming.&nbsp; So the meeting, first, will focus on how the federal government can improve wildfire preparedness and response efforts, protect public safety, and deliver assistance to our people in times of urgent need.<br>&nbsp;<br>As a former local elected official himself &#8212; maybe he will always feel that way in his heart, I think.&nbsp; He feels it&#8217;s really important to engage directly, sit with people &#8212; as you can, either remotely or in person &#8212; to really discuss what the holdups are, what the challenges are, how can we help be better partners from the federal government.&nbsp; So this is an example of that.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Governor Kate Brown, Governor of Oregon; Governor of California, Gavin Newsom; Governor of New Mexico, Michelle Lujan Grisham; Governor of Wyoming, Mark Gordon; Governor of Colorado, Jared Polis; Governor of Utah, Spencer Cox; and Governor of Nevada, Steve Sisolak, will be the governors who will be in attendance.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Could I just confirm that Governor Little and Governor Gianforte are not invited?&nbsp; And Governor Inslee?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; That&#8217;s the list of attendees I have.&nbsp; I can certainly check if there&#8217;s more on who or &#8212; was or wasn&#8217;t invited.&nbsp; Oh, go ahead.&nbsp; I said I would go to right next.&nbsp; We’ll &#8212; we’ll make sure we get to you.&nbsp; I promise.<br>&nbsp;<br>Go ahead.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you offer more specifics about what the President and the White House will do over the next week to continue to boost support for this infrastructure bill?&nbsp; Can we expect him to be on the phone with Republicans that have expressed concerns about his comments yesterday?&nbsp; Or &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; You can expect, as is evidenced by the fact that he called Senator &#8212; he had a conversation with Senema- &#8212; Senator Simina &#8212; Sinema?&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Ugh, Friday.&nbsp; That’s a hard one.&nbsp; Senator Sinema this morning that he, of course, be on the phone, and he will be engaging directly with members of both parties about moving his priorities forward.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>You know, sometimes that&#8217;s scheduled or planned a day in advance or the day before, so I don&#8217;t have more specifics for you.&nbsp; But as they happen, we&#8217;ll read them out for you.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I just follow up on that, please?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Has he called any of the Republican senators today?&nbsp; Obviously, you were mentioning earlier that he&#8217;s talked about this publicly, what his stance was.&nbsp; There are Republican senators that are surprised by what he said yesterday and are upset, as has been reported.&nbsp; So has he talked to them today?&nbsp; And what is he doing to sort of keep this deal intact?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, first, I think what he&#8217;s doing, Anita, is continuing to convey and provide details to the public &#8212; who care deeply about whether he&#8217;s delivering for them, less about the mechanics of the process &#8212; about why this should be a package that&#8217;s supported broadly by Democrats and Republicans across Congress.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So that&#8217;s what I did, certainly, at the beginning, and that&#8217;s the case he&#8217;s going to continue to make.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did he call any of those senators today though?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have any additional calls to read out.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>I think &#8212; let&#8217;s see &#8212; go ahead.&nbsp; Go ahead.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks so much, Jen.&nbsp; First, just following up on an earlier question.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Special Immigrant Visa population from Afghanistan: Does the United States plan to protect those translators and people who worked for Americans who have already fled Afghanistan and are in different countries currently?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, they’re individuals who are already in the SIV pipeline.&nbsp; I suppose some of them might not be.&nbsp; I can certainly &#8212; might not be still there.&nbsp; I can certainly check and see if they&#8217;re &#8212; if they&#8217;ve already departed Afghanistan, how that would apply.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then I have another question about the manatee population in Florida.&nbsp; They are dying &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; That was not on my bingo card today &#8212; (laughter) &#8212; but I’m happy to answer it.&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, the Wall Street Journal had a good article about them this week.&nbsp; They are dying at a record pace.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Mm-hmm.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q &nbsp;Eight hundred of them died in the last year. &nbsp;And I wanted to see if the administration believes that these animals should be relisted as endangered, and also whether anything in Biden’s infrastructure deal that he struck yesterday would continue on to help with &#8212; part of the problem is that they’re &#8212; the Florida waters are not clean.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;Yeah.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And it&#8217;s sort of hurting their habitat.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah, I will say, in in all seriousness &#8212; I mean, certainly, it&#8217;s an important question, an important issue.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t want the &#8212; the pro-manatee &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Inaudible.)<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; &#8212; people to not think I feel that.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>But I will say that, yes, there are components of his &#8212; of his package.&nbsp; I mean, a part of this package &#8212; a big part of this package is a down payment on climate resilience, on ensuring that we are cleaning up some of the polluted areas in our country &#8212; something that is impacting a lot of communities proportionally more than others.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So that is &#8212; I would have to check on sort of what that means for the Florida coast &#8212; I think you said, specifically there.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>In terms of relisting them &#8212; it&#8217;s a great question.&nbsp; I just have to talk to the &#8212; the folks &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One more about Afghanistan, please.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; &#8212; who would be more specific about that.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Go ahead.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Nazira Karimi, Afghan journalist.&nbsp; There are many protestors &#8212; Afghan protestors &#8212; outside the White House.&nbsp; They are waiting and they have a high expectations from today&#8217;s two Presidents meeting.&nbsp; Do you have any message for them?&nbsp; Because as soon as I leave here, I go to see them and get their opinion.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;Well, I would say that the &#8212; the meeting today is an opportunity to convey, from the President, that we have an ongoing commitment &#8212; we are committed to supporting the Afghan people and the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces, even as we continue to undertake a security transition.<br>&nbsp;<br>The President is also going to emphasize, during this meeting, the need for unity, cohesion, and for the Afghan government to focus on the key challenges Afghanistan faces.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And so, as you noted, we’ll welcome both President Ghani and Chairman Abdullah.&nbsp; And one of the most important messages he will stress is that they need to have a united front as Afghanistan continues to address security and other challenges.<br>&nbsp;<br>And finally, he will emphasize our continuing diplomatic support for the peace process and for all Afghan parties to engage in good faith in that process.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So the bottom line that you can convey is that he&#8217;s going to discuss our enduring United States support, including through security assistance to the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces, development and humanitarian assistance to support the Afghan people, and diplomatic engagement in support of peace.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Thank you, guys.&nbsp; I&#8217;m sorry.&nbsp; You&#8217;ve got a &#8212; you’ve got to gather.&nbsp; Oh, I’m sorry.&nbsp; Chris.&nbsp; Chris.&nbsp; Chris.&nbsp; And then I want to go to Amna because it&#8217;s her first time too, so okay.&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Go ahead.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All right.&nbsp; Happy Pride.&nbsp; I know we&#8217;re running short on time,&nbsp; I’m just going to smush my multiple inquiries today on the LGBT developments into one, and that is &#8212; (laughter).&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Take your time; it&#8217;s okay.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; People can leave if they need to gather.&nbsp; No one is rushing you out of here.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The initiatives today: How do they place in the President&#8217;s both domestic and foreign policy agenda?&nbsp; And don&#8217;t they fall short of the President signing the Equality Act into law?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, first, on the &#8212; well, let me start with the first one because I think that&#8217;s an important question, because what we do here and the values that we advocate for in the United States do send an important message around the world, and sometimes we forget that.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So, during his remarks today, the President will outline, of course, the historic step his &#8212; his administration has taken, but he will also renew his calls on the Senate to swiftly pass the Equality Act and provide overdue, explicit civil rights protections to LGBTQ people and families across the country.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>He will also speak directly to the proliferation of state-level anti-LGBTQ bill- &#8212; plus &#8212; bills, denouncing them as un-American and legislation disguised as bullying.&nbsp; And he will commend the community for their courage and bravery pushing progress forward.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Finally, he will announce his appointment of Jessica Stern as the U.S. envoy to advance the human rights of LGBTQ persons at the Department of State, a role &#8212; just to make the connection here &#8212; that will be critical to advancing his agenda overseas and around the world, as well.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any plans for the President to visit the soon-to-be Pulse Memorial?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have anything to preview in terms of travel beyond next week.&nbsp; Maybe &#8212; we don&#8217;t work too far ahead in planning around these parts, but certainly the fact that he&#8217;s signing this legislation today sends a clear message about, you know, his commitment to the LGBTQ+ community, and to commemorating what was a tragedy in our nation&#8217;s history.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Amna.&nbsp; Okay, last one.&nbsp; And then everybody can gather.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two quick ones on &#8212; the NewsHour has been in touch with Taliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen.&nbsp; Ran by him the reports of hundreds of additional U.S. forces staying beyond the withdrawal.&nbsp; This is his response: He says, “It&#8217;s a violation of the commitment and the agreement made by the U.S.&nbsp; It jeopardizes the peace process and could pave the way for continued prolonged war.”&nbsp; So what&#8217;s the White House response to that?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I would say, first, that we have been very clear &#8212; and the President was when he made his announcement about his plans to withdraw troops &#8212; that we plan to have a diplomatic presence on the ground, including &#8212; including a security presence to protect our diplomatic presence on the ground.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s something that has been a part of the discussion from the beginning.<br>&nbsp;<br>And beyond that, I certainly would have to talk to our national security team if there&#8217;s more.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just one more quick one: The family of Mark Frerichs &#8212; a U.S. Navy veteran who is still held hostage in Afghanistan &#8212; is worried that as U.S. troops continue to leave, you&#8217;ve lost all leverage in any efforts to free him.&nbsp; So what&#8217;s the President&#8217;s message to his family?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; The President&#8217;s message is that he will continue to fight every day of his presidency to bring Americans home who are detained overseas in &#8212; whether it&#8217;s in Afghanistan or any other country around the world.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Again, we will have a diplomatic presence on the ground.&nbsp; We will continue to work closely with the government, with security support, humanitarian support.&nbsp; And there needs to be continued &#8212; continued political process, ongoing negotiations.&nbsp; That will be part of the President&#8217;s message today when he meets with the leaders.<br>&nbsp;<br>Thanks, everyone, so much.&nbsp; Happy Friday.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>The United States continues to use its full diplomatic, economic, and assistance toolkit to support a peaceful and stable Afghanistan.</em></p>



<p>Today, President Biden welcomed Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani and Chairman of the High Council for National Reconciliation Dr. Abdullah Abdullah to the White House to discuss enduring United States support, including through security assistance to the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces, development and humanitarian assistance to support the Afghan people, and diplomatic engagement in support of peace.<br><br>Our strong support and partnership is designed to prevent Afghanistan from ever again being used as a safe haven for terrorism; maintain Afghan stability and build self-reliance; promote economic growth; preserve social gains in education, health and women’s empowerment and the rule of law; protect the rights of women, girls, and minorities; bolster Afghan civil society; and respond to humanitarian needs.  <strong>Since 2002, the United States has provided nearly $88 billion in security assistance, $36 billion in civilian assistance, including $787 million specifically intended to support Afghan women and girls, and nearly $3.9 billion in humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan.</strong><br><br>The United States will continue to provide assistance through its enduring partnership with Afghanistan to promote a peaceful and stable future that the Afghan people want and deserve.  This includes:<br><br><strong>Providing COVID-19 vaccines to the Afghan people.</strong>  As part of our work to end the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide, and in response to a recent surge in COVID cases in Afghanistan, the United States will donate three million doses of Johnson and Johnson vaccine to the people of Afghanistan through COVAX. COVAX is working to ship those doses to Afghanistan.<br><br><strong>Providingcritical emergency medical assistance to respond to the COVID-19 crisis</strong>. USAID is also supporting Afghan efforts to respond to the critical shortfalls in oxygen and medical ventilation support by providing emergency and structural assistance. USAID has ordered over 300 oxygen cylinders and several months’ worth of ventilator consumables to be shipped to Afghanistan as quickly as possible.  Additionally, USAID plans to install oxygen plants in four hospitals that will serve smaller facilities in the surrounding areas. USAID previously announced that they are investing $3.7 million to train clinicians to manage severe cases in the five hardest hit urban cities and provide critical expertise for vaccine deployment. <br><br><strong>Providing needed assistance to help with the pandemic’s impacts. </strong>This is in addition to in the past year, the State Department and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) have provided $40 million to directly help Afghanistan respond to the COVID-19 outbreak, expedited $90 million in other COVID-related development assistance through the World Bank, and reoriented other U.S. development assistance to support Afghan efforts to deal with the pandemic’s consequences.  And, USAID recently committed $38 million in emergency COVID-19 supplemental funding to the UN World Food Program (WFP) to address the food and nutrition needs of approximately 1.2 million COVID-impacted vulnerable people in Afghanistan.  WFP will reach over a million people most affected by the economic impacts of COVID-19 with in-kind food assistance to help them meet their food needs for four months. Additionally, with this funding, WFP will reach more than 164,000 children and nearly 28,000 pregnant and lactating women with essential moderate acute malnutrition treatment.<br><br><strong>Contributing lifesaving humanitarian assistance to Afghans in need</strong>. The U.S. recently announced more than $266 million in new humanitarian assistance to address the pressing needs of an estimated 18 million people in Afghanistan, including more than 4.8 million internally displaced Afghans.  This funding will allow our partners to provide lifesaving protection, shelter, livelihood opportunities, essential health care, emergency food aid, water, sanitation, and hygiene services to respond to the needs generated by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.  Furthermore, this assistance will help to address protection needs for the most vulnerable Afghans.  This includes women and girls facing particular risks, including gender-based violence, as a result of decades of conflict and the pandemic.<br><br><strong>Continuing security assistance.  </strong>The Department of Defense’s Afghanistan Security Forces Fund (ASFF) will provide financial support to the Afghan National Army, Afghan National Police, Afghan Air Force and the Afghan Special Security Forces, including the Special Mission Wing.  Congress appropriated over $3 billion to ASFF in 2021 and the President has requested over $3.3 billion for 2022. <br><br><strong>Sustaining development assistance to support a secure, stable, unified, democratic, and self-reliant Afghanistan that is at peace with itself and its neighbors. </strong> As part of our commitment to invest in and support the Afghan people, the United States has recently announced an additional $300 million in civilian assistance for Afghanistan in 2021 through both the Department of State and USAID.  The President has also requested an additional $364 million in development assistance for the State Department and USAID for 2022.<br><br>This assistance demonstrates our enduring support for the Afghan people.  The funding will be targeted at sustaining the gains of the past 20 years by improving access to essential services for Afghan citizens, promoting economic growth, fighting corruption and the narcotics trade, improving health and education service delivery, supporting women’s empowerment, enhancing conflict resolution mechanisms, supporting the Afghan-led peace process and bolstering Afghan civil society.<br><br><strong>Mobilizing diplomatic support for peace and stability. </strong>The United States continues to press for a just and durable peace in Afghanistan. The United States recognizes that the best way to protect our interests and the interests of the Afghan people is through an Afghan-owned and Afghan-led negotiated settlement. Following intensive efforts by the State Department and a number of our key allies and partners, formal Afghanistan Peace Negotiations started last year for the first time since 2001. We continue to urge all Afghan parties to engage urgently and meaningfully in peace talks aimed at achieving a just and durable settlement that includes protections for the rights of all Afghans, including women and minorities.  The appointment of Mr. Jean Arnault as the United Nations Secretary General’s personal representative on Afghanistan and regional issues reflects the critical role of the United Nations in bringing together Afghan sides and regional stakeholders to end Afghanistan’s more than 40-year war.<br><br><strong>Standing with Partners in Support of the Afghan people.</strong>  Building on the broad international support for the Afghan people, the United States will encourage our partners to continue their security and development assistance, including through the Afghan National Army Trust Fund (ANATF), Law and Order Trust Fund for Afghanistan (LOTFA), and the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF).  The United States will also work closely with other major donors to ensure continued development and humanitarian assistance to help the Afghan people.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>President Biden spoke this afternoon with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis to offer support after the President approved an emergency declaration for Miami-Dade County, Florida last night following the partial collapse of a residential building in Surfside, Florida. The President said his administration stands ready to provide additional resources and assistance that state and local officials need. The President expressed his gratitude for the heroic first responders and search and rescue teams who are working tirelessly and whose bravery and courage have saved lives. The President also expressed his condolences to the Governor and the people of the Surfside community, sharing his grief for the families who lost loved ones in this devastating tragedy and for the families who are waiting in anguish as search and rescue efforts continue.</p>



<p><strong><u>Background:</u></strong></p>



<p>The President approved the emergency declaration shortly after receiving the request from the Governor of Florida, ordering Federal assistance be made available. The emergency declaration authorizes FEMA to coordinate disaster relief efforts, reimburse response costs, provide equipment and resources to assist with debris removal and emergency protective measures in order to try to save lives, and to provide temporary shelter and housing for those who have been displaced. FEMA has deployed an Incident Management Assistance Team to Florida to provide support for the state and two FEMA-supported search and rescue teams are involved in the response to this devastating incident. FEMA is also sending building science experts, search and rescue technical experts, and a mobile command center. Additional FEMA National Urban Search and Rescue System teams are on alert if requested. The White House and FEMA have been in close coordination with local officials throughout the past two days. The White House is continuing to monitor the situation, and the President will continue to receive regular updates from his Homeland Security team.</p>

<p>Freedom and equality are fundamental American values. But today, millions of Americans lack basic non-discrimination protections just because of who they are or whom they love. President Biden believes that every American must be able to live freely, openly, and safely. That’s why he continues to call on the Senate to swiftly pass the Equality Act, legislation which will provide long overdue federal civil rights protections to LGBTQ+ Americans and their families, while strengthening some key civil rights laws for people of color, women, people with disabilities, and people of faith.</p>



<p><strong>Despite the progress our Nation has made towards full equality, LGBTQ+ Americans still lack full non-discrimination protections in 29 states. </strong>In the absence of a Federal non-discrimination law, more than half of all U.S. states lack laws on the book prohibiting discrimination against LGBTQ+ individuals and families. The lack of federal non-discrimination protections for LGBTQ+ people means that millions of Americans can be denied housing, education, credit and more just because of who they are or whom they love. In states across the country, LGBTQ+ Americans can get married on Sunday, and denied a rental lease on Monday.<br><br><strong>The Equality Act will provide long overdue civil rights protections on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity – ensuring LGBTQ+ Americans are finally afforded equal protection under law. </strong>The Equality Act amends the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to provide explicit non-discrimination protections on the basis of sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity. The bill builds on the Supreme Court’s ruling in <em>Bostock v. Clayton County </em>by making explicit that non-discrimination protections for LGBTQ+ people in employment settings apply to other areas of life.</p>



<p><strong>The Equality Act will help protect LGBTQ+ Americans who continue to report facing discrimination. </strong><a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/press-releases/poll-lgbtq-americans-discrimination/">Studies</a> show that majority of LGBTQ+ Americans say they have personally experienced discrimination because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Transgender Americans, especially transgender women of color, continue to face rampant discrimination in housing, employment, and in public. These types of discrimination cause LGBTQ+ Americans to face higher rates of poverty, violence, and unemployment than other Americans.</p>



<p><strong>Discrimination isn’t just wrong. It also is detrimental to the physical health and safety of LGBTQ+ Americans, especially transgender women of color.</strong>&nbsp;LGBTQ+ Americans still face discrimination when seeking medical care or visiting a doctor. In surveys, nearly 29% of transgender people in the United States say they’ve been refused medical care because of their identity, which can lead to avoidance of medical care. &nbsp;That is why the Department of Health and Human Services <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2021/05/10/hhs-announces-prohibition-sex-discrimination-includes-discrimination-basis-sexual-orientation-gender-identity.html">announced</a> that it is taking steps to address and prevent discrimination against LGBTQ+ Americans in healthcare settings, but Federal legislation is needed to codify these protections. Discrimination also leads to violence. Transgender women of color face epidemic levels of violence. Too often, this violence stems from institutional discrimination in healthcare settings, housing, and employment.</p>



<p><strong>Anti-LGBTQ+ discrimination also contributes to mental health inequities faced by LGBTQ+ youth. </strong><a href="https://www.thetrevorproject.org/survey-2021/?section=Introduction">75 percent</a> of LGBTQ+ youth say they’ve experienced discrimination because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Discrimination and bullying are detrimental to the mental health of any young person, and more than half of all transgender and non-binary youth say they have seriously considered commitment suicide in the past year. To address bullying and discrimination at school, the Department of Education has <a href="https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-confirms-title-ix-protects-students-discrimination-based-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity">announced</a> that it is taking steps to expand protections for LGBTQ+ students in our Nation’s schools, but Federal legislation is needed to codify these protections.</p>



<p><strong>The Equality Act will also expand public accommodations protections for people of color, women, and people of faith. </strong>The Equality Act would also strengthen civil rights protections for other protected groups, including people of color, women, people with disabilities, and people of faith by expanding where non-discrimination protections apply to public accommodations.</p>

<p>The President spoke to Senator Sinema today to thank her again for her work on the Bipartisan Infrastructure Agreement. He reiterated his strong support for the compromise agreement, and they discussed his plan to try to build support for the Agreement among both Democrats and Republicans. The President also reiterated that he would fight to pass the Bipartisan Agreement, as he committed to the group. The President reiterated strong support for both the Bipartisan Infrastructure bill and a reconciliation bill containing the American Families Plan moving forward on a two-track system, as he said yesterday when meeting the press with the bipartisan group of ten Senators. These are two critical priorities to the President that he wants to see advance through the legislative process as quickly as possible, pass as quickly as possible, and be presented to him for signing as quickly as possible. The President looks forward to signing both these bills.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Green Road Community Center<br>Raleigh, North Carolina</p>



<p>5:33 P.M. EDT</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Hello, Raleigh.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; I &#8212; I&#8217;m going to &#8212;</p>



<p>AUDIENCE MEMBER:&nbsp; (Inaudible.)&nbsp; (Laughter.)</p>



<p>AUDIENCE MEMBER:&nbsp; We love you!&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Love you back.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Well, look, that old &#8212; I &#8212; you&#8217;re &#8212; by the way, you&#8217;re in the midst of the &#8212; you&#8217;re in the presence of a &#8212; one hell of an individual.&nbsp; I want you all to know about.&nbsp; Not me.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; He&#8217;s always there when people need help, and he particularly focuses on people who are left behind: Reverend Barber.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Thanks for all you do, Rev.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ive, I thank you for that introduction, you know, and for everything you&#8217;re doing.</p>



<p>You know, I &#8212; I think &#8212; I thank you everyone here at the Green Road Community Center for hosting us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Governor Cooper, my good friend.&nbsp; A great governor.&nbsp; But the most important thing: He&#8217;s a man of enormous integrity, and &#8212; no, he really is.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; You&#8217;re doing an incredible job; I&#8217;m lucky to have you as a partner, Gov.&nbsp; And as we &#8212; as we move along here.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Look, you know, the main thing I want to do is start off with the way you should never start off.</p>



<p>Are they &#8212; do you have chairs out there?&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Well, if you have a chair, sit.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t stand for me.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; I was getting the &#8212; I was getting to feel really guilty, man.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>I said that a while ago, as the press will tell you. &nbsp;About a year ago, I said, &#8220;Why don&#8217;t everybody sit down?&#8221;&nbsp; And somebody in the front said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t have a damn seat.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why.&#8221;&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; I want to get in trouble.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thank you.&nbsp; I thought you didn&#8217;t have any seats there.&nbsp; I was going to really feel guilty.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Folks, look, it&#8217;s great to be Mayor Baldwin of Raleigh and Mayor &#8212; Mayor Schewel of Durham.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And joined by a proud native son of North Carolina: the Administrator of the EPA in Washington, D.C., Michael Regan.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Where are you, Michael?&nbsp; I&#8217;m always worried &#8212; (applause) &#8212; I&#8217;m always worried when I come back to North Carolina and Michael is with me that the governor is going to take him back.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; But I need him.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Look, folks, he&#8217;s doing one heck of a job at EPA.&nbsp; And if you want to talk about health, think about the environment.&nbsp; Think about what&#8217;s happen &#8212; being done &#8212; what we&#8217;re changing at EPA.&nbsp; And the &#8212; it makes a big deal.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s also &#8212; it&#8217;s also out there, across the state, encouraging people to get vaccinated as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I wanted to come to Raleigh to thank everyone in this room for everything you&#8217;re doing to get your community vaccinated.&nbsp; It matters.&nbsp; It matters.&nbsp; You&#8217;re saving lives.&nbsp; That&#8217;s not hyperbole.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let me remind everybody: We lost 600,000 dead in America in about a year.&nbsp; That&#8217;s more than every life lost in World War One, World War Two, the Vietnam War, Iraq, Iran, across the board &#8212; Afghanistan.&nbsp; More lives lost in a year than every major war in the 20th century and the 21st century.&nbsp; And guess what, folks?&nbsp; There&#8217;ve been lives lost all around the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, America, I might say &#8212; this is not &#8212; I didn&#8217;t plan on saying this, but I&#8217;m going anyway: We have an obligation in the United States of America to live up to who we are.&nbsp; America is the only &#8212; is a unique nation.&nbsp; We&#8217;re the only nation formed based on an idea &#8212; an idea, not an ethnicity, not an ideology, not a &#8212; idea: We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men and women are created equal, et cetera.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Well, here&#8217;s the deal.&nbsp; Here&#8217;s the deal.&nbsp; There are over 100 countries in the world that have no capacity to help themselves right now.&nbsp; None.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And that&#8217;s why &#8212; I got somewhat criticized, but that&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve worked so darn hard &#8212; after being able to nail down, in the first 100 days, over 60 [600] million doses of vaccine for Americans, I went to Europe to meet what they call the &#8220;G7&#8221; and then with NATO and then with the EU.&nbsp; And I promised that the United States, in the remainder of this year and the first half of next year, is going to provide a billion doses to the rest of the world.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; A billion doses.</p>



<p>Half a billion of those will be done between now and January and the first half of next year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The point being: I wanted the nation to reflect what you all reflect.&nbsp; Everyone in this room, there&#8217;s everything &#8212; you &#8212; I want to thank you for all you&#8217;re doing.&nbsp; But the rest of the world is in trouble as well.&nbsp; We have to look out for one another.&nbsp; We really do.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And what you&#8217;re doing here &#8212; going back to the United States &#8212; nonprofits directing folks to where to go; houses of worship opening on-site vaccination for congregants; my friend Reverend Barber is here, as I said, and countless faith leaders who are truly doing God&#8217;s work; college students providing rides for seniors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, what&#8217;s happening in America is what America is all about.&nbsp; That&#8217;s what the rest of world is looking at: Are we what we advertise ourselves to be?&nbsp; It&#8217;s because of people like you, here in Raleigh and in communities across America, that we&#8217;re going to win this fight.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Look at the progress we made so far.&nbsp; Today, 66 percent of all American adults have gotten at least one shot.&nbsp; That includes 87 percent of all seniors of all colors; 75 percent of adults ages 40 and up have gotten a shot; and 70 percent of those age 30 and up.</p>



<p>Nationwide, we’re seeing the lowest number of daily cases and deaths since the first day of the pandemic.&nbsp; And we&#8217;ve built equity into the heart of the vaccination program.&nbsp; I put together a vaccination team, headed by a really bright guy, and we put together a group of 23 doctors.&nbsp; And what they did was we had one doc who does nothing but deal with equity &#8212; access for people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There&#8217;s a reason why it&#8217;s been harder to get African Americans, initially, to get vaccinated: because they&#8217;re used to be experimented on &#8212; the Tuskegee Airmen and others.&nbsp; People have memories.&nbsp; People have long memories.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s awful hard, as well, to get Latinx vaccinated as well.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; They&#8217;re worried that they&#8217;ll be vaccinated and deported.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, look, from day one, something that Governor Cooper has been totally focused on is making sure we get as many people vaccinated, particularly people who don&#8217;t have access to healthcare usually; who don&#8217;t have ordinary &#8212; don&#8217;t have doctors or family physicians, et cetera.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Seventy three percent of the shots administered at community health centers through the federal program we have and more than 58 percent of the shots administered in federally-run vaccination sites have gone to people of color.&nbsp; It makes a gigantic difference.</p>



<p>And across the nation, people of color have accounted for more than half of all the vaccinations in the last month.&nbsp; The more we close the racial gap in vaccination rates, the more lives we can save.&nbsp; And if I can &#8212; (applause).&nbsp;</p>



<p>And if I can pause for one second: That’s why I’ve called for spending billions of dollars at NIH focusing on new ways to deal with obesity, diabetes, Alzheimers, and cancer.&nbsp; Focused just on those diseases &#8212; money that private drug companies don’t have the money to invest in or the inclination to.&nbsp; Because guess what?&nbsp; In most Black communities across America and Hispanic communities, how many stores have fresh vegetables?&nbsp; How many stores have a &#8212; I’ll go down the list.&nbsp; It matters.&nbsp; The health condition a person enters this fight over makes a big difference as to what, in fact, is going to be able to be done.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here in North Carolina, my administration provided $105 million from the emergency man- &#8212; Federal Emergency Management Agency &#8212; FEMA &#8212; to help get people vaccinated.&nbsp; Working with the governor and the mayors and county officials across the state, there are 240 personnel in the Tar Heel State just to put the needle in somebody’s arm.</p>



<p>This has been a gigantic &#8212; a gigantic logistical challenge not just in North Carolina, but all across America.&nbsp; More than 660 National Guard members have supported the COVID-19 response here in North Carolina.&nbsp; Over in Greensboro, we stood up the federal vaccination site that alone has administered 135,000 shots.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The governor and I visited one of the mobile units you’re deploying to meet people where they live.&nbsp; And as a result of these efforts statewide, case deaths are down over 90 percent in the last five months.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All of this is great news.&nbsp; But here’s the deal: For all the progress we’ve made as a country, hospitalizations and deaths are down drastically in places where people are getting vaccinated.&nbsp; The data couldn’t be clearer: If you’re vaccinated &#8212; if you’re vaccinated, you’re safe.&nbsp; You are still at risk of getting seriously ill or dying if you, in fact, have not been vaccinated.&nbsp; That’s just a fact.</p>



<p>And this new, dangerous variant that continues to emerge &#8212; it’s now the most common variant in America and here.&nbsp; And unvaccinated people are incredibly vulnerable.&nbsp; This is a serious concern with what experts call the “Delta” variant.&nbsp; It is not only &#8212; according to the CDC, between 10 to 20 percent of all cases in the last two weeks have been the Delta variant.</p>



<p>Dr. Fauci has made it clear &#8212; he and my wife have been traveling the country to make this case &#8212; that it’s more easily transmittable, this Delta variant, potentially deadlier, and especially dangerous for young people &#8212; for young people.&nbsp; He says its the greatest threat to our fight to beat COVID-19.</p>



<p>But the good news is, we have a solution.&nbsp; The science is clear.&nbsp; The best way to protect yourself against the virus and its variants is to be fully vaccinated.&nbsp; It works.&nbsp; It’s free.&nbsp; It’s safe.&nbsp; It’s easy.&nbsp; It’s convenient.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over 150 million Americans have gotten fully vaccinated and they’re safe and protected now, including against the Delta variant.&nbsp; They’re getting back to living their lives and spending time with their loved ones.&nbsp; But we need more people to get fully vaccinated to finish the job.&nbsp; That’s why I’m here.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I called for June to be the “Month of Action” to get folks vaccinated so we can all enjoy a Fourth of July with our independence from the virus &#8212; from the virus.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you’re already vaccinated, make sure your family and friends are vaccinated.&nbsp; Help them make a plan to get vaccinated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you’ve gotten your first shot, make sure you get your second one to be fully protected.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; It’s a big deal.</p>



<p>And if you’re not vaccinated, don’t put it off any longer. Just do it.&nbsp; Just do it.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; And it’s never been easier.&nbsp; It&#8217;s never been easier to do it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Text your Zip Code to 438829 &#8212; 438829.&nbsp; And, immediately, it will pop to find the vaccination sites closest to you.&nbsp; And hardly anyone is beyond five miles from a potential site.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Get a free ride to and from your vaccination sites.&nbsp; I want to publicly thank &#8212; when I asked for help, both Lyft or Uber said between the time &#8212; this last month to July 4th, they’ll provide a ride free to and from.&nbsp; They’ll wait and take you back home.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>Thousands of pharmacies are offering no-appointment, walk-in vaccinations.&nbsp; More than 1,400 pharmacies are in North Carolina that do that.&nbsp; They’ve already administered over 2.2 million shots &#8212; these pharmacies.&nbsp; Many of them are open 24 hours on Fridays.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, go tomorrow if you’ve not gotten it done.&nbsp; Or when you’re going out, knocking on doors, tell them, “Tomorrow, 24 hours, a majority of these drugstores are open.”&nbsp; Get it done.&nbsp; Get it done.&nbsp; And they get it done at their convenience.</p>



<p>And if you still have questions, that’s okay.&nbsp; Talk to people who you know who have gotten the shot.&nbsp; That’s what you guys are out there &#8212; going to be doing, knocking on doors.&nbsp; Talk to your doctor or your health provider.&nbsp; If you don’t have one, physicians know it’s the right choice to get vaccinated to protect themselves, their patients, and their communities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And listen to North Carolina’s own Dr. Kizzy Corbett, you know, from Hurdle Mills, just about an hour north from here.&nbsp; She’s a scientist at NIH that I met several weeks ago who helped develop the COVID-19 vaccine &#8212; (applause) &#8212; a vaccine that was developed after decades of research under Republican and Democratic administrations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As I said, I met her earlier this year during a tour of the NIH Vaccine Research Center where this all happened.&nbsp; She’s incredible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Folks, there is no reason to leave yourself vulnerable to the deadly virus for one single day more.&nbsp; And as they say in my church, I’m preaching to the choir, I know.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; But the television is recording this.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Make the case.&nbsp; Let people know getting vaccinated is not only maybe going to save their lives, but save their mother, their father, their child, their son, their daughter, their coworker.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, please, please get vaccinated.&nbsp; And let’s everyone do our part.&nbsp; Let’s everyone do it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This weekend, we will be hosting another nationwide canvassing event where volunteers like you are going to knock on doors and talk to their friends and neighbors and help finish the job of getting America vaccinated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This weekend, we&#8217;ll be hosting another nationwide canvassing event where volunteers like you are going to knock on doors and talk to friends and neighbors to help finish the job of getting America vaccinated.</p>



<p>To join that effort, I say to the people watching this &#8211;because these people have already joined the effort: To join that effort, please visit WeCanDoThis.HHS.governor [sic] &#8212; .gov, excuse me &#8212; WeCanDoThis.HHS.gov.&nbsp; Sign up.&nbsp; Get involved.</p>



<p>We can do this.&nbsp; We really can do this.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let me close where I began.&nbsp; To all of you here today who are about to head out and canvass your communities: Thank you from the bottom of my heart.&nbsp; I genuinely mean it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But just listen, again, to Ive &#8212; graduated from Apex Friendship High, just finished her first year in school.&nbsp; She&#8217;s been spending her summer doing door-to-door &#8212; going door to help get people vaccinated to stay safe.</p>



<p>And I’ll bet what she had to say, when asked, is what a lot of you think as well.&nbsp; She said, quote &#8212; I hope you don’t mind my repeating this, Ive &#8212; but she said, quote, “Reaching out and giving back to the community is everything.&nbsp; I like to say…I don&#8217;t dream of having a dream job or a dream career, but I dream of truly helping people in the best way I can…that&#8217;s my life goal.”</p>



<p>This can be among one of the most important things you do. I really mean it.&nbsp; And again, remember &#8212; I think you&#8217;re probably the least ones that have to remember &#8212; remember: 600,000-plus Americans have died.&nbsp; Six hundred thousand-plus Americans have died.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This Delta variant &#8212; you know there&#8217;s going to be others as well.&nbsp; You know what&#8217;s going to happen.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve got to get our young people vaccinated. &nbsp;</p>



<p>So, talk to those moms when you knock on the door.&nbsp; Tell them about &#8212; tell them about why it&#8217;s so important to get their children.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You may remember, I got widely criticized when I suggested we keep dropping the age of people eligible for vaccinations.&nbsp; It&#8217;s been based on the science.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t do anything based on a whim.&nbsp; The science, the tests show that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And what&#8217;s going to happen here, I predict, as soon as we go from temporary approval to permanent approval &#8212; which just takes time; it&#8217;s not that its (inaudible) is there &#8212; it&#8217;s going to increase the number of people willing to move as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, Ive, thank you for representing the best of us.&nbsp; Thank all of you for representing the best of us.&nbsp; You&#8217;ve all got the whole world in front of you.&nbsp; And, you know, it&#8217;s because of &#8212; it&#8217;s because of people like Ive and all of you why I have so much faith in the future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I&#8217;m not being &#8212; you know, if you notice, I&#8217;ve been unfairly criticized for being optimistic.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve been fairly criticized because I think we can actually pull people together.&nbsp; I ran &#8212; when I ran for President, I ran for three reasons.&nbsp; I said, one, is restore the soul of America &#8212; just basic decency, looking out for one another.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, two, because we had to rebuild the backbone of this country that had been so damaged, which is the middle class &#8212; (applause) &#8212; working-class folks and middle-class folks.&nbsp; It was about time to build the economy from the middle up and out and from the middle class up.&nbsp; That&#8217;s what we have to do.</p>



<p>Folks, let&#8217;s really let this be the summer of joy and freedom.&nbsp; Let it really happen.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s celebrate the Fourth of July with the independence from the virus.&nbsp; We can get this done.&nbsp; We &#8212; no, we really can get this done, and we really can do it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But you know what?&nbsp; I said the third reason I was running was to unify the country.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Well, folks, it&#8217;s never been as divided as it is today &#8212; never been as divided as it is today, since the Civil War.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, folks, it’s such a waste of talent, such a waste of time.&nbsp; And the rest of the world is looking at us.&nbsp; The rest of the world is wondering whether or not can we really lead the world again.&nbsp; The last four years have been devastating to our leadership around the world.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; I&#8217;m not making &#8212; but it’s true.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But here&#8217;s the way we lead: Like you always lead &#8212; those who lead better than I and others &#8212; you lead by example, and the example is twofold.&nbsp; And I&#8217;ll end with this.&nbsp; One is making sure we do everything in our power to walk that extra mile, to knock on that door, to pick up the phone, to actually pull up in your own vehicle and take someone who needs to get to a vaccination site.&nbsp; Convince them.&nbsp; Let them know why it&#8217;s so important.&nbsp; Let them know.&nbsp; Because people &#8212; people respond to individual relationships, even new ones.&nbsp; “I got it.&nbsp; My brother got it.&nbsp; My sister got it.&nbsp; I took my daughter, and she got it,” et cetera.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And secondly, let the world know that when it comes down to lifesaving initiatives, no matter where they are &#8212; but they come from us &#8212; we should share them with the world &#8212; the whole world.&nbsp; We&#8217;re even giving some of these vaccines to nations that are not our friends because the people are not the ones who are not our friends &#8212; the leadership.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, folks, there&#8217;s a lot we can do.&nbsp; As I said, I have faith in your generation.&nbsp; The reason I&#8217;m so optimistic is because you&#8217;re the most incredible generation in American history.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not being solicitous.&nbsp; Number one, you&#8217;re the least prejudiced generation in history, number one.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>Number two, you volunteer than most &#8212; any other generation, including my vaulted generation of the ’60s.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; You &#8212; no, I mean it.&nbsp; We are proud of what we did, but you volunteer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Number three, you&#8217;re the best-educated generation in the history of America.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I believe our dealing with equity is only the beginning as it relates to vaccine.&nbsp; The first executive order I signed was insisting that every one of my Cabinet members focus on racial equity &#8212; (applause) &#8212; because we have a &#8212; we have a chance &#8212; we have a chance to make significant change in this country, and it&#8217;s going to come from what you guys do.&nbsp; I really mean it.&nbsp; I can&#8217;t thank you enough.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sorry to take so much of your time, but God bless you all.&nbsp; And may God protect our troops.&nbsp; Thank you, thank you, thank you.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>
