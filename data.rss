<p class="has-text-align-center">Kantei,<br>Tokyo, Japan</p>



<p>2:36 P.M. JST</p>



<p>PRESIDENT BIDEN:&nbsp; Well, Mr. Prime Minister, it’s a pleasure to see you again here in Japan.&nbsp; We just finished, I thought, a very productive morning together at the Quad Leaders’ Summit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And our &#8212; on our video call in April, you highlighted the need for democracies to deliver.&nbsp; I think that’s what we&#8217;re doing today.&nbsp; We’re talking about how to deliver through the Quad and the U.S.-India cooperation as well.&nbsp; And so, we&#8217;re delivering for our people and for the wider world.</p>



<p>Do I want to stop for interpretation?&nbsp;</p>



<p>INTERPRETER:&nbsp; Yes, sir.&nbsp; Yes, sir.</p>



<p>PRESIDENT BIDEN:&nbsp; I think it’s a good idea.&nbsp; (Laughter.)</p>



<p>And here in Tokyo, we announced two new initiatives &#8212; the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework and the Indo-Pacific Maritime Domain Awareness program &#8212; that&#8217;s going to bring India and the United States together with other nations to reflect our vision for a more open and more prosperous, connected, and secure world.</p>



<p>I’m pleased that we’ve reached agreement for the U.S. Development Finance Corporation to continue its important work in India supporting vaccine production, clean energy initiatives.&nbsp; And I am also glad we&#8217;re renewing the Indo-U.S. Vaccine Action Program.</p>



<p>We also discussed the ongoing effects of Russia’s brutal and unjustified invasion of Ukraine and the effect it has on the entire global world order.&nbsp; And the U.S. and India are going to continue consulting closely on how to mitigate these negative effects.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to continuing our conversation today.&nbsp; Mr. Prime Minister, there&#8217;s so much that our countries can and will do together, and I am committed to making the U.S.-India partnership among the closest we have on Earth.</p>



<p>Thank you.</p>



<p>PRIME MINISTER MODI:&nbsp; (As interpreted.)&nbsp; Mr. President, it’s always a pleasure to meet you.&nbsp; And today, we also participated together in a very positive and useful Quad Summit.</p>



<p>The India-America strategic partnership is, in the true sense, a partnership of trust.</p>



<p>Our common interests &#8212; our common interests in defense and other relations &#8212; in defense and other matters, and our shared values, have indeed strengthened this bond of trust between our two countries.</p>



<p>Our people-to-people relations and our strong economic cooperation makes our partnership even more unique.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our trade and investment relations are also steadily on the rise, but they are still well below potential.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I am absolutely confident that with the conclusion of the India-USA Investment Incentive Agreement, we will see concrete progress in investment between our two countries.</p>



<p>We’re also increasing bilateral cooperation in the domain of technology.&nbsp; And even on global issues, we cooperate closely.</p>



<p>We both share similar views on the Indo-Pacific.&nbsp; And at the bilateral level, as well as with likeminded countries, we continue to work to protect our common concerns.</p>



<p>The Quad and the IPEF are two important examples of this cooperation.&nbsp; And I believe that our discussions today will give even further speed to this positive momentum.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m absolutely sure that the India-U.S. friendship will continue to be a force for good, for global peace and stability, for sustainability of the planet, and for human development.</p>



<p>PRESIDENT BIDEN:&nbsp; So am I.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>2:45 P.M. JST</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Kantei,<br>Tokyo, Japan</p>



<p>3:21 P.M. JST<br> <br>PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Well, Mr. Prime Minister, welcome.  Welcome.  I know you’ve been on the job a long time.  <br> <br>PRIME MINISTER ALBANESE:  Thank you.  (Laughter.)  All over.<br> <br>PRESIDENT BIDEN:  All over it.  I&#8217;m sure you will be.  And I appreciate you making the effort to be here so quickly.  You&#8217;re such a critical part of the Quad, and your absence would have been &#8212; made a big difference &#8212; a negative difference.  <br> <br>And &#8212; and as I said earlier, I appreciate your determination to get here so quickly.  And I &#8212; it’s testament to Australia being all in on our shared vision on what we have to do.<br> <br>I think that it&#8217;s important to demonstrate that in democracies, we have the power to deliver from &#8212; and it comes from our people &#8212; and that it’s real.  <br> <br>And so, I hope your people are prepared to understand why you got up here so quickly.  And we appreciate it.  <br> <br>I’m looking forward to having a chance to get to know you a bit and more personally.  I always get kidded by Barack Obama when I would say to him, “All politics is personal.”  I’m looking forward to a personal relationship with you because I think it&#8217;s critical.  <br> <br>The alliance between Australia and the United States has long been an anchor of stability and prosperity I &#8212; in the Indo-Pacific.  Our nations have stood shoulder-to-shoulder in every conflict since World War One.  And &#8212; and I&#8217;m proud that our alliance<s>s</s> is strong as it&#8217;s ever been, and I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;ll even get stronger with your leadership.  <br> <br>So, thank you for coming to Tokyo, Mr. Prime Minister.  Congratulations again on your election.  And the floor is yours.<br> <br>PRIME MINISTER ALBANESE:  Well, thank you very much, Mr.  President.  And it &#8212; it&#8217;s been an honor to start my prime ministership and the new government with meetings with yourself and also with Prime Minister Kishida and Prime Minister Modi.<br> <br>Australia and the United States are great friends.  Many years ago, a young fellow &#8212; myself in my &#8212; in my 20s, I was a guest of your State Department with the State Department program and had &#8212; had five weeks in the &#8212; in the U.S.  <br> <br>Diverse &#8212; we went to &#8212; I &#8212; they had a program, which was &#8212; you could design a theme, and mine was &#8212; I wanted to see the interaction of groups with the U.S. government.  So, I did everything from the National Rifle Association to the Sierra Club to Planned Parenthood to the full &#8212; the full kit and caboodle across the spectrum.  (Laughter.)<br> <br>PRESIDENT BIDEN:  (Gets up and pretends to walk away.)  (Laughter.)  You&#8217;re a brave man.  (Laughter.)<br> <br>PRIME MINISTER ALBANESE:  I am.<br> <br>PRESIDENT BIDEN:  You’re a brave man.  <br> <br>PRIME MINISTER ALBANESE:  I am.<br> <br>PRESIDENT BIDEN:  (Inaudible.)<br> <br>PRIME MINISTER ALBANESE:  But it was an &#8212;<br> <br>PRESIDENT BIDEN:  The Sierra Club and the National Rifle.<br> <br>PRIME MINISTER ALBANESE:  &#8212; an opportunity to see the &#8212; the full diversity of the way that the country operates.  And as well, of course they do &#8212; you do dinners in people&#8217;s homes as well, who host you.  And it was a chance to really immerse myself there.  <br> <br>And I had security briefings in &#8212; in Hawaii on the way back.  And the &#8212; the U.S. State Department was good enough as well to manage to justify a trip to Vegas as well.  (Laughter.)  I&#8217;m not quite sure &#8212; I&#8217;m not quite sure where that fitted in, but it was a &#8212; it was a good trip indeed.  <br> <br>And, of course, my &#8212; my government is very committed to the alliance.  We&#8217;re very proud of the fact that the alliance was forged by John Curtin during World War Two &#8212; that we turned to America.  And that led, in the post war, to what we&#8217;ve just celebrated as the 70th anniversary of the formal alliance, but it really began when our country was under threat.  And we commemorated as well, recently, the 80th anniversary of &#8212; of USS Peary in Darwin &#8212; the American loss of life.  And we&#8217;ve been friends ever since. <br> <br>And we play a very important role, in terms of national security, for us but for our region as well.  I was a part of a government that brought the U.S. Marines to Darwin &#8212;<br> <br>PRESIDENT BIDEN:  (Inaudible.)<br> <br>PRIME MINISTER ALBANESE:  &#8212; under Julia Gillard, which was a very important move.  And I look forward to really strengthening our relationship.<br> <br>I&#8217;ve &#8212; I&#8217;ve been a partic- &#8212; we last met when you were Vice President under my participation in the Australia American Leadership Dialogue &#8212; I&#8217;ve done for many, many years &#8212; and that&#8217;s an important body.  And I&#8217;ve known some of your colleagues, Kurt in particular, for some time through that process as well.<br> <br>PRESIDENT BIDEN:  I apologize (inaudible).  (Laughter.)  <br> <br>PRIME MINISTER ALBANESE:  He’s a good guy.  <br> <br>PRESIDENT BIDEN:  He’s a great guy.  <br> <br>PRIME MINISTER ALBANESE:  I quote him regularly.  So &#8212;<br> <br>PRESIDENT BIDEN:  So do I.  (Laughter.)  <br> <br>PRIME MINISTER ALBANESE:  He’s very important.  <br> <br>So, thank you, Mr. President, for your congratulations and your warm welcome.  And I look forward to welcoming you down to the Quad Leaders’ Meeting next year.  But also, my intention to thank you to &#8212; I will be visiting the U.S. before then.  I look forward to &#8212;<br> <br>PRESIDENT BIDEN:  I’d like to invite you to the U.S. &#8212;<br> <br>PRIME MINISTER ALBANESE:  &#8212; to that.  <br> <br>PRESIDENT BIDEN:  &#8212; well before then.  <br> <br>PRIME MINISTER ALBANESE:  Thank you.  <br> <br>PRESIDENT BIDEN:  And maybe we can work out a time sooner than later, but you are going to have to be home at some point.  (Laughter.)  (Inaudible.)<br> <br>PRIME MINISTER ALBANESE:  Indeed.  It&#8217;s working out okay so far.  (Laughter.)<br> <br>PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Well, thank you very much.  <br> <br>Thank you, press.<br> <br>PRIME MINISTER ALBANESE:  Thank you.  <br> <br>3:27 P.M.

<p>Russia has demonstrated that it is an unreliable supplier of energy to Europe through unjustified and unacceptable actions such as cutting off electricity and natural gas to Finland, halting natural gas exports to Poland and Bulgaria, and threatening similar actions against other European nations. The United States and the European Commission condemn Russia’s use of energy blackmail and reaffirm our commitment to strengthening Europe’s energy security.</p>



<p>Across Europe, from the Nordics to the Balkans, efforts are underway to diversify supplies and reduce dependence on Russian gas.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 2020, Finland has been interconnected to Estonia via the Balticonnector, a project supported by the European Commission, which increases security of supply for Finland and the region. Furthermore, on May 1, the Poland-Lithuania Gas Interconnector started its commercial operation which reinforces optionality and resilience of the whole Baltic gas market and was also supported through the Connecting Europe Facility of the European Commission.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The European Commission and the United States understand the urgency of taking decisive action to reduce energy imports from Russia. Together, we are partnering to address these challenges under our joint Task Force on Energy Security announced by Presidents Biden and von der Leyen on March 25.&nbsp; Through the Task Force we will continue working to diversify Europe’s supply of natural gas while we accelerate the deployment of energy efficiency and smart technologies in European homes and businesses, electrify heating, and ramp-up clean energy output to reduce demand for fossil fuels altogether.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As an important step towards realizing the goals of the Task Force, the European Commission and the United States welcome Finland’s contract to lease a floating LNG import terminal from a U.S. provider that will be operational before the end of this year.  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Highlights the Most Equitable Economic Recovery Ever</em><em></em></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Details Efforts to Ensure Equity in 32 Major American Rescue Plan Policies</em></p>



<p>Today, the American Rescue Plan Implementation Team and the Domestic Policy Council released their interim&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ADVANCING-EQUITY-THROUGH-THE-AMERICAN-RESCUE-PLAN.pdf">American Rescue Plan Equity Report</a>. It covers 32 different American Rescue Plan programs that represent nearly $900 billion or 60 percent of American Rescue Plan funds, excluding Economic Impact Payments (i.e., stimulus checks).&nbsp;The report, together with ongoing economic statistics provides further evidence that the American Rescue Plan spurred the most equitable recovery in memory. The report also outlines lessons learned and areas for continued work and collaboration with external partners to build on progress to date, including through the release of the ARP Equity Learning Agenda.</p>



<p>Since the American Rescue Plan passed: The American Rescue Plan helped power a historic recovery which led to the largest job growth ever in a calendar year, saw unemployment claims decline from nearly 20 million when President Biden took office to close to 1 million – and unemployment reach 3.6% – a level the Congressional Budget Office did not predict our nation would reach during the entire decade. It is also critical to recognize that the cumulative impact of the American Rescue Plan – as well as the design and implementation of its policies – has led to a historically equitable recovery. Below are some of the highlights:&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><u>A Historically Equitable Recovery</u></strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>Black Unemployment – largest calendar year drop since 1983 &amp; below pre-pandemic rate:</strong>&nbsp;2021 featured the fastest calendar year of decline in the number of unemployed Black workers on record and the largest calendar year drop in the unemployment rate (2.9 percentage points) since 1983—now&nbsp;<a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LNS14000006">down</a>&nbsp;to 5.9 percent in April,&nbsp;<em><u>below pre-pandemic levels</u></em>&nbsp;– instead of taking over six years to recover as it did after the Great Recession.<ul><li><strong>Black employment is 233,000 above pre-pandemic levels:</strong>&nbsp;When President Biden took office, 1.4 million fewer Black workers were employed than pre-pandemic. In April 2022, there were 233,000 more Black workers with jobs than in February 2020.&nbsp;</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Black Teen Unemployment is below its pre-pandemic rate.</strong></li></ul></li><li><strong>Hispanic Unemployment – record calendar year drop &amp; below pre-pandemic rate at just 4.1%:&nbsp;</strong>Hispanic unemployment fell by 4.5 points in 2021 from 9.4% to 4.9 percent—the<strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong><em><u>largest calendar year drop</u></em>&nbsp;on record – and has&nbsp;<a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LNS14000009">fallen further</a>&nbsp;to 4.1% in April,&nbsp;<em><u>below pre-pandemic levels</u>.&nbsp;</em>Following the official end of the Great Recession, Hispanic Unemployment took<em>&nbsp;</em>over six years after the end of the recession to reach pre-crisis levels.&nbsp;<ul><li><strong>Hispanic employment is 618,000 above pre-pandemic:&nbsp;</strong>When President Biden took office, Hispanic employment was still 2.1 million below February 2020 levels. By April 2022, there were 618,000 more employed Hispanic workers than pre-pandemic.&nbsp;</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Hispanic Women’s Unemployment is down to 3.8%, below pre-pandemic levels:&nbsp;</strong>Hispanic women’s unemployment has fallen from 8.8% in January 2021 to 3.8% in April 2022, below pre-pandemic rates.&nbsp;</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Hispanic Teen Unemployment reached a record low in March 2022 – and is below its pre-pandemic rate.</strong></li></ul></li><li><strong>Asian American Unemployment –&nbsp;down to 3.1%:&nbsp;</strong>Asian American unemployment has fallen from 6.6% in January 2021 to 3.1% —approaching pre-pandemic levels. Asian American unemployment averaged 5% or above each year from 2009 to 2014.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Unemployment in Rural Counties with Persistent Poverty:&nbsp;</strong>Unemployment in rural counties with persistent poverty spiked in 2020 and remained above 6 percent through mid-summer 2021—but by the end of 2021, it&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/amber-waves/2022/february/persistently-poor-rural-counties-experienced-lower-employment-impacts-from-the-coronavirus-covid-19-pandemic-but-have-higher-cumulative-covid-19-case-rates/">fell</a>&nbsp;to 4.2 percent—well below pre-pandemic levels.</li><li><strong>Youth Unemployment – record calendar year drop:&nbsp;</strong>Youth employment among 16-24-year-olds is&nbsp;<a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LNS14024887">down</a>&nbsp;to 7.9 percent, matching 2019 lows and roughly at pre-pandemic levels, after the&nbsp;<em><u>largest calendar year drop on record</u></em>&nbsp;in 2021.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>More jobs were created in rural communities in 2021 than in any other year in the last two decades</strong>.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Women’s Unemployment down to 3.5%:</strong>&nbsp;Women’s unemployment has&nbsp;<a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LNS14000002">fallen</a>&nbsp;from a peak of 16.1% in April 2020 to 3.5%&nbsp;<strong>–&nbsp;</strong>equal to its pre-pandemic level, and slightly lower than the unemployment rate for men.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Long-term Unemployment – record 12-month drop:</strong>&nbsp;The number of Americans who were long-term unemployed&nbsp;<a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UEMP27OV">fell</a>&nbsp;by 2.8 million in the 12 months after the American Rescue Plan passed –&nbsp;<em><u>the largest 12-month drop on record</u></em>.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Stronger financial security for lower income families</strong><strong>:</strong><ul><li><strong>J.P. Morgan Chase</strong>&nbsp;data shows that families have more in their checking accounts than pre-pandemic, including the bottom 25% of households who&nbsp;<a href="https://www.jpmorganchase.com/institute/research/household-income-spending/household-pulse-cash-balances-at-year-end">ended</a>&nbsp;2021 with 65% more in the bank than in 2019.&nbsp;</li></ul><ul><li><strong>The Federal Reserve’s Report on the Economic Well-Being of U.S. Households</strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/2021-report-economic-well-being-us-households-202205.pdf">found</a>&nbsp;that a higher share of Americans were financially secure in 2021 than in previous years:<ul><li>The highest share of Americans could cover a $400 emergency cash expense – up 18 points since 2013.</li></ul><ul><li>The highest share of Americans – and the highest share of Black, Asian, Hispanic, and white Americans – reported that they were at least doing OK financially.&nbsp;</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Credit Card Delinquencies – which usually hit low-income and Black and Latino borrowers hardest – are at record lows:</strong>&nbsp;In the final three quarters of 2021, credit card delinquencies hit record lows&nbsp;as fewer Americans took on riskier debt (with less credit card debt than pre-pandemic). Credit card delinquencies disproportionately impact Black and Hispanic borrowers, according to the New York Federal Reserve’s&nbsp;<a href="https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2021/11/unequal-distribution-of-delinquencies-by-gender-race-and-education/">analysis</a>&nbsp;of 15 years of consumer data on public and community college students.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><u></u></strong></li><li><strong>Strong real income growth for Black and Hispanic workers:&nbsp;</strong>The J.P. Morgan Chase Institute found that over the past two years since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, Black and Hispanic households experienced the highest real income growth trends, with Black households reaching about 7.5 percent annualized real income growth over the past two years.</li></ul>



<p><strong><u>Enhanced Child Tax Credit Led to Lowest Black and Hispanic Child Poverty Rate Ever in 2021</u></strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>Child Tax Credit leading to record low child poverty rates:&nbsp;</strong>Researchers project that the CTC will have been the leading factor in driving the child poverty rate to its lowest rate on record in 2021—and result in record low Hispanic and Black child poverty rates.&nbsp;<strong><u></u></strong></li><li><strong>Monthly CTC payments helped to reduce food insufficiency among low-income families by 25 percent.</strong><strong></strong></li><li><strong>The American Rescue Plan made half of Black Children and half of Hispanic Children eligible for the full expanded child tax credit who would have previously gotten only a partial credit</strong>.

<p><strong><u>Provided $130 Billion To Keep Schools Open Safely and Address Students&#8217; Academic and Mental Health Needs</u></strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>American Rescue Plan’s $122 billion in K-12 to reopen schools, address learning loss, and address student mental health, with a strong equity focus:&nbsp;</strong>The American Rescue Plan provided $122 billion to keep schools open safely, combat learning loss and address student mental health, with&nbsp;funds allocated based on which school districts have students with the greatest needs. These resources are addressing critical local needs like teachers and counselors—particularly for students who were disproportionately impacted by the pandemic.<ul><li><strong>Safely Reopened Nearly 100% of Schools—Up From 46% Open Before American Rescue Plan—Helping Address Inequities of Remote Learning:&nbsp;</strong>Thanks to the resources provided by the American Rescue Plan, nearly 100% of schools are now open safely for full-time, in-person instruction—up from 46%&nbsp;open&nbsp;before the American Rescue Plan.&nbsp;Keeping schools open safely&nbsp;is helping&nbsp;address the inequities of remote learning, such as Black and Hispanic students&nbsp;being more&nbsp;likely to remain remote through late 2020&nbsp;and less likely to have what they needed to learn effectively.&nbsp;</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Cut Education Staff Shortages in Half:</strong>&nbsp;When&nbsp;When the President took office, there were 624,000 fewer staff working in our schools than before the pandemic.

Because of how funding was allocated, this planned spending will benefit schools serving students the greatest needs.</li></ul></li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>The American Rescue Plan invested $800 million to create a new Homeless Children and Youth Fund provide wrap-around services to children experiencing homelessness, and enable them to attend and fully participate in school.</strong></li><li><strong>The American Rescue Plan provided $3 billion in additional funding for students with disabilities:&nbsp;</strong>These funds are being used to provide equitable, high-quality, and inclusive services to children with disabilities and their families – a critical need especially after COVID-19 exacerbated existing challenges experienced by states and school systems.</li></ul>



<p><strong><u>Keeping America’s College Students Enrolled and On Track to Graduate</u></strong><strong><u></u></strong></p>



<p>The American Rescue Plan &#8216;s Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund provided&nbsp;<strong>more than $10 billion to community colleges and their students</strong>, and the&nbsp;<strong><u>largest ever one-time investment – $2.7 billion – in Historically Black Colleges and Universities and their students</u></strong>. Other investments include:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Approximately $190 million to Tribal Colleges and Universities</strong></li><li><strong>Approximately $11 billion to Hispanic-Serving Institutions&nbsp;</strong></li><li><strong>$5 billion to Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander-Serving Institutions</strong></li><li><strong>Colleges and universities are required to dedicate roughly half of these funds toward emergency financial aid grants directly to students. The Department of Education expects a greater proportion of funds will ultimately be provided directly to students.&nbsp;</strong></li></ul>



<p><strong><u>Helping Hard-Pressed Families Reduce Utilities Costs and Avoid Shutoffs</u></strong><strong><u></u></strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>Low-Income Home Emergency Assistance Program (LIHEAP) is on track to serve more households in FY 2022&nbsp;than in any prior year in the program’s 41-year history.&nbsp;</strong>The American Rescue Plan provided $4.5 billion to more than double typical LIHEAP funding to modest and lower-income working families and seniors. The Biden-Harris Administration’s record funding for LIHEAP is combating the strain of the pandemic for low-income households and communities of color who disproportionately face&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aceee.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/u2006.pdf">high energy burdens</a>&nbsp;– with Black households spending 32% more of their income on energy, Native American households spending 35% more of their income, and Hispanic households spending 13% more of their income on energy than the median household.&nbsp;<ul><li><strong>Coordinated efforts to ensure benefits reached families quickly:</strong>&nbsp;The White House called on grantees to prioritize quick and automatic distribution of LIHEAP benefits and led expanded outreach to households, including Spanish-speaking families and communities of color.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Led call to action to prevent shutoffs and expedite delivery of aid:&nbsp;</strong>The White House has announced commitments from 14 major utility companies across the country, as well as a major delivered fuel trade association, to prevent devastating utility shutoffs and expedite the delivery of unprecedented aid.</li></ul></li><li><strong>First-ever national Low Income Water Assistance to provide critical nationwide water support:</strong>&nbsp;The American Rescue Plan funded the first-ever federal program for water assistance. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has allocated over $1 billion of available LIHWAP funds to 49 states, over 100 Tribes, five territories and the District of Columbia.&nbsp;<ul><li><strong>Water affordability concerns and growing household indebtedness disproportionately impacts low-income individuals and communities of color</strong>&nbsp;and can lead to multiple adverse household impacts such as service disconnections, home foreclosures, and evictions.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Prioritized populations that often experience the greatest barriers in accessing social&nbsp;service programs,</strong>including: households with low incomes that included seniors, persons with disabilities and households with children under five years old.&nbsp;</li></ul></li></ul>



<p><strong><u>Closing Health Disparities</u></strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>Record number of enrollments&nbsp;into health coverage thanks to American Rescue Plan&#8217;s expansion of insurance subsidies:&nbsp;</strong>Over 14.5 million consumers selected or were automatically re-enrolled in health insurance coverage during the 2022 Open Enrollment Period – a 21% increase compared to the 2021 Open Enrollment Period, which ended December 15, 2020 during the last Administration.&nbsp;<ul><li><strong>Biden Administration efforts and expanded American Rescue Plan subsidies helped lead to 26% increase in Hispanic enrollment and 35% increase in Black enrollment in health coverage on HealthCare.gov.</strong></li></ul><ul><li><strong>Increased access to low-cost health coverage for uninsured Asian Americans, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islanders (AA and NHPIs):</strong>&nbsp;197,000 uninsured AA and NHPIs became newly eligible for premium savings through the American Rescue Plan’s expanded subsidies.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li><strong>The American Rescue Plan is providing states with a new option to extend postpartum health coverage from 60 days up to 12 months.</strong><ul><li>This Medicaid state option helps postpartum individuals maintain health care coverage in an effort to reduce maternal morbidity and mortality and to improve well-baby milestones – which disproportionately impacts Black and American Indian and Alaskan Native women.&nbsp;</li></ul><ul><li>Many maternal deaths occur in the postpartum period and are considered preventable with appropriate follow-up care – the CDC has found that 66 percent of postpartum deaths are preventable.</li></ul></li><li><strong>The American Rescue Plan Invested $1.5 billion Towards the Prevention and Treatment of Substance Abuse:</strong>&nbsp;These funds are helping to address the estimated one in five older adults in the United States currently experiencing depression, anxiety, insomnia, substance use, or another mental health disorder, with higher rates of drug overdose deaths among black men. Programs are required to target underserved populations, including but not limited to, pregnant women and women with dependent children; persons using opioids and/or stimulant drugs associated with drug overdoses; persons at risk for HIV, TB, and Hepatitis; LGBTQ individuals; rural populations; and other underserved groups.</li><li><strong>Historic Investment of $25 Billion in Home and Community-Based Services (HCBS) To Expand Availability of Services:&nbsp;</strong>HCBS help older adults and individuals with disabilities live independently outside of institutionalized settings. To date, nearly 8 million beneficiaries have received HCBS services under the American Rescue Plan. The American Rescue Plan is also funding longer-term investments to grow the pipeline of HCBS workers, as well as increase compensation and improve job quality for these workers – who are disproportionately women of color.</li></ul>



<p><strong><u>Reducing Hunger</u></strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>Reached over 30 million children with the first-ever nationwide Summer EBT program</strong><ul><li>States estimate they were able to issue EBT cards (or add benefits to existing cards) to the families of well over 30 million children in the summer of 2021, helping children access meals when not in school.</li><li>The ARP Summer EBT program was critical to ensuring equitable response to food insecurity. While children from low-income families and children of color take advantage of their schools’ lunch and breakfast programs, a relatively small fraction who participate in free and reduced lunch during the school year typically access summer feeding programs.&nbsp;</li></ul></li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>The American Rescue Plan extended P-EBT through the end of the COVID-19 public health emergency and expanded access to territories:&nbsp;</strong>The ARP provided a guarantee that low-income pre-school-age children in Puerto Rico, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands have access to P-EBT benefits on the same terms as children in all other states and territories.</li><li><strong>Increasing WIC Participation –disproportionately helping low-income, families of color and at-risk pregnant and postpartum women and their children</strong><ul><li><strong>USDA has allocated $250 million in funding to support increased participant enrollment and retention and $120 million to reduce disparities in program delivery</strong>. Between 2016 and 2018, the overall WIC participation rate&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fns.usda.gov/wic/eligibility-and-coverage-rates-2018">declined</a>&nbsp;from 48% to 45%. WIC disproportionately supports Black and Hispanic families – with 4.4 million Hispanic, 2.4 million Black, and 1 million people of other/multi-races qualifying for the program in 2018.</li><li>Evidence shows that WIC is one of the most powerful evidence-based public health interventions available and is uniquely positioned to reduce racial disparities in maternal and child health outcomes.</li></ul></li></ul>



<p><strong><u>Revitalizing Local Economies Across the Country</u></strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>Today, we &#8211; Prime Minister Anthony Albanese of Australia, Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida of Japan, and President Joe Biden of the United States &#8211; convene in Tokyo to renew our steadfast commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific that is inclusive and resilient.</p>



<p>Just over one year ago, Leaders met for the first time. Today in Tokyo, we convene for our fourth meeting, and our second in person, to demonstrate, at a time of profound global challenge, that the Quad is a force for good, committed to bringing tangible benefits to the region. In our first year of cooperation, we established the Quad’s dedication to a positive and practical agenda; in our second year, we are committed to deliver on this promise, making the region more resilient for the 21<sup>st</sup> century.</p>



<p>With the COVID-19 pandemic still inflicting human and economic pain around the world, tendencies for unilateral actions among states and a tragic conflict raging in Ukraine, we are steadfast. We strongly support the principles of freedom, rule of law, democratic values, sovereignty and territorial integrity, peaceful settlement of disputes without resorting to threat or use of force, any unilateral attempt to change the status quo, and freedom of navigation and overflight, all of which are essential to the peace, stability and prosperity of the Indo-Pacific region and to the world. We will continue to act decisively together to advance these principles in the region and beyond. We reaffirm our resolve to uphold the international rules-based order where countries are free from all forms of military, economic and political coercion.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Peace and Stability</strong><br>We discussed our respective responses to the conflict in Ukraine and the ongoing tragic humanitarian crisis, and assessed its implications for the Indo-Pacific. Quad Leaders reiterated our strong resolve to maintain the peace and stability in the region. We underscored unequivocally that the centerpiece of the international order is international law, including the UN Charter, respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity of all states. We also emphasized that all countries must seek peaceful resolution of disputes in accordance with international law.</p>



<p>The Quad is committed to cooperation with partners in the region who share the vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific. We reaffirm our unwavering support for ASEAN unity and centrality and for the practical implementation of ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific. We welcome the EU’s Joint Communication on the EU Strategy for Cooperation in the Indo-Pacific which was announced in September 2021 and increased European engagement in the Indo-Pacific region. We will champion adherence to international law, particularly as reflected in the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), and the maintenance of freedom of navigation and overflight, to meet challenges to the maritime rules-based order, including in the East and South China Seas. We strongly oppose any coercive, provocative or unilateral actions that seek to change the status quo and increase tensions in the area, such as the militarization of disputed features, the dangerous use of coast guard vessels and maritime militia, and efforts to disrupt other countries’ offshore resource exploitation activities.</p>



<p>Individually and collectively, we will further strengthen our cooperation with Pacific island countries, to enhance their economic well being, strengthen health infrastructure and environmental resilience, to improve their maritime security and sustain their fisheries, to provide sustainable infrastructure, to bolster educational opportunities, and to mitigate and adapt to the impacts of climate change, which pose especially serious challenges for this region. We are committed to working together to address the needs of Pacific island partners. We reaffirmed our support for Pacific Islands Forum unity and for Pacific regional security frameworks.</p>



<p>Among ourselves and with our partners, we will deepen our cooperation in multilateral institutions, including at the United Nations, where reinforcing our shared priorities to reform and enhance the resilience of the multilateral system itself. Individually and together, we will respond to the challenges of our time, ensuring that the region remains inclusive, open, and governed by universal rules and norms.</p>



<p>We reaffirm our commitment to the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, consistent with United Nations Security Council Resolutions (UNSCRs) and also reconfirm the necessity of immediate resolution of the issue of Japanese abductees. We also condemn North Korea’s destabilizing ballistic missile development and launches, including multiple intercontinental ballistic missile tests, in violation of UNSCRs, and call on the international community to fully implement these resolutions. We urge North Korea to abide by all of its obligations under the UNSCRs, refrain from provocations, and engage in substantive dialogue.</p>



<p>We remain deeply concerned by the crisis in Myanmar, which has caused grave humanitarian suffering and posed challenges to regional stability. We continue to call for the immediate end to violence in Myanmar, the release of all political detainees, including foreigners, engagement in constructive dialogue, humanitarian access, and the swift restoration of democracy. We reaffirm our support for ASEAN-led efforts to seek a solution in Myanmar and welcome the role of Special Envoy of the ASEAN Chair. We further call for the urgent implementation of the ASEAN Five Point Consensus.</p>



<p>We condemn unequivocally terrorism and violent extremism in all its forms and manifestations and&nbsp;&nbsp; reiterate that there can be no justification for acts of terror on any grounds whatsoever. We denounce the use of terrorist proxies and emphasize the importance of denying any logistical, financial or military support to terrorist groups which could be used to launch or plan terror attacks, including cross-border attacks. We reiterate our condemnation of terrorist attacks, including 26/11 Mumbai and Pathankot attacks. We also reaffirm UNSC Resolution 2593 (2021), which demands that Afghan territory must never again be used to threaten or attack any country or to shelter or train terrorists, or to plan or finance terrorist attacks. We emphasize the importance of upholding international standards on anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism by all countries, consistent with FATF recommendations. We reaffirm that in our fight against global terrorism, we will take concerted action against all terrorist groups, including those individuals and entities designated pursuant to the UNSC Resolution 1267(1999).<br><br><strong>COVID-19 and Global Health Security</strong><br>For more than two years, the world has grappled with the devastating impacts of COVID-19 – on our communities, citizens, health workers and systems and economies. The Quad countries have led and will continue to lead global efforts for COVID-19 response, with a view to building better health security and strengthening health systems. We commit to adapt our collective approaches to get ahead of the virus with a focus on preparing for new variants, and getting vaccines, tests, treatments, and other medical products to those at highest risk.</p>



<p>To date, the Quad partners have collectively pledged approximately USD $ 5.2 billion to the COVAX AMC, approximately 40 percent of the total contributions from government donors. We are proud to have delivered over 670 million doses, including at least 265 million doses to Indo-Pacific. Noting significant expansion in the global supply of COVID-19 vaccines, we will continue to share safe, effective, affordable and quality-assured COVID-19 vaccines where and when they are needed.</p>



<p>We welcome the progress on the expansion of J&amp;J vaccine production at the Biological E facility in India under the Quad Vaccine Partnership&#8211; sustainable manufacturing capacity will yield long-term benefit in the fight against COVID-19 and future pandemics. In this regard, we look forward to the grant of WHO’s EUL approvals regarding the aforementioned vaccines in India. We celebrate the donation by the Quad to Cambodia and Thailand of WHO approved Made in India vaccines, together with Quad members’ other vaccine related support, as an example of tangible achievement of our collaboration.</p>



<p>We will continue to address both the COVID-19 response and preparedness against future health threats. We will accelerate getting shots in arms through last mile support of which over 2 billion USD has been provided in more than 115 countries globally by our four countries, and will also address vaccine hesitancy through a Quad-convened event this week at the World Health Assembly. We will coordinate our efforts including through the &#8220;COVID-19 Prioritized Global Action Plan for Enhanced Engagement (GAP),&#8221; and COVAX Vaccine Delivery Partnership.&nbsp; We welcome the successful 2nd Global COVID-19 Summit co-hosted by the United States, and joined by the Quad members, which galvanized $3.2 billion in financial and policy commitments. We will strengthen support for economic and social revitalization in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>



<p>In the long term, we will strengthen the global health architecture and pandemic prevention, preparedness and response (PPR) to build better health security, including by enhancing finance and health coordination and bolstering on-going science and technology cooperation, such as through clinical trials and genomic surveillance<strong>.</strong> Building on existing Quad collaboration, we will enhance our capacity to improve early detection and monitor new and emerging pathogens with pandemic potential, and work to increase resilience to epidemics and pandemics. For the development of new vaccines to prevent and contain infectious diseases, Quad partners have collectively committed $524 million to the next phase of CEPI’s work, accounting for about 50 percent of the total public investors.</p>



<p>We commit, as members of the Group of Friends of UHC, to take global leadership to further strengthen　and reform the global health architecture for enhancing PPR and promoting UHC in the lead up to the UN High Level Meeting on UHC to be held in 2023.<br><br><strong>Infrastructure</strong><br>We reaffirmed our shared commitment to deepen cooperation on infrastructure, which is critical to driving productivity and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region. We also share a commitment to addressing debt issues, which have been exacerbated by the pandemic in many countries.</p>



<p>Quad partners bring decades of skills and experience together to catalyse infrastructure delivery to the region. We are committed to working closely with partners and the region to drive public and private investment to bridge gaps. To achieve this, Quad will seek to extend more than 50 billion USD of infrastructure assistance and investment in the Indo-Pacific, over the next five years.</p>



<p>We will work to strengthen capacities of the countries in need to cope with debt issues under the G20 Common Framework and by promoting debt sustainability and transparency in close collaboration with finance authorities of relevant countries, including&nbsp; through the&nbsp; &#8220;Quad Debt Management Resource Portal,&#8221; which consists of multiple bilateral and multilateral capacity building assistance.</p>



<p>We also welcome the meeting of the development finance institutions and agencies of the four countries in the margins of the Quad Leaders’ Meeting. We are working closely with experts, our region and each other to link our toolkits and expertise to better connect the Indo-Pacific.</p>



<p>We will further deepen collaboration and pursue complementary actions in identified areas, such as regional and digital connectivity, clean energy, and climate resilience including disaster resilience in energy related facilities that reflect the region’s priorities including ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific, to contribute to sustainable and inclusive growth in the region.<br><br><strong>Climate</strong><br>Recognizing the urgent need to address climate change as emphasized in the latest IPCC reports, we will steadfastly implement the Paris Agreement and deliver on the outcomes of COP26, accelerating our efforts to raise global ambition, including reaching out to key stakeholders in the Indo-Pacific region and supporting, strengthening, and enhancing climate actions by partners in the region including through mobilizing climate finance, both public and private, and facilitating the research, development, and deployment of innovative technology.</p>



<p>Today, we launch the &#8220;Quad Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation Package (Q-CHAMP)” with &#8220;mitigation&#8221; and &#8220;adaptation&#8221; as its two themes. Q-CHAMP includes ongoing activities under the Quad Climate Working Group on: green shipping and ports aiming for a shared green corridor framework building on&nbsp; each Quad country’s input; clean energy cooperation in clean hydrogen and methane emissions from the natural gas sector; strengthening clean energy supply chains, welcoming the contribution of the Sydney Energy Forum; climate information services for developing an engagement strategy with Pacific island countries; and disaster risk reduction, including disaster and climate resilient infrastructure such as the efforts through the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI). Its coverage includes new cooperation in clean fuel ammonia, CCUS/Carbon Recycling, cooperation and capacity building support to advance high integrity carbon markets under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, climate-smart agriculture, knowledge sharing on subnational climate actions, and ecosystem-based adaptation. To make Q-CHAMP tangible, we are committed to expanding our programs, in support of climate actions between our four countries as well as in the Indo-Pacific region. We recognize the immense challenges posed by climate change to the island nations of the Pacific.</p>



<p>We welcome the new Australian Government&#8217;s commitment to stronger action on climate change, including through passing legislation to achieve net zero by 2050 and lodging a new, ambitious Nationally Determined Contribution.<br><br><strong>Cybersecurity</strong><br>In an increasingly digital world with sophisticated cyber threats we recognize an urgent need to take a collective approach to enhancing cybersecurity. To deliver on the Quad Leaders’ vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific, we commit to improving the defense of our nations’ critical infrastructure by sharing threat information, identifying and evaluating potential risks in supply chains for digitally enabled products and services, and aligning baseline software security standards for government procurement, leveraging our collective purchasing power to improve the broader software development ecosystem so that all users can benefit. The Quad partners will coordinate capacity building programs in the Indo-Pacific region under the Quad Cybersecurity Partnership, and will initiate the first-ever Quad Cybersecurity Day to help individual internet users across our nations, the Indo-Pacific region, and beyond to better protect themselves from cyber threats.</p>



<p><strong>Critical &amp; Emerging Technologies</strong><br>The Quad remains focused on harnessing critical and emerging technologies to enhance the prosperity and security of the region. In the area of 5G and beyond 5G, while welcoming the Prague Proposals on Telecommunications Supplier Diversity, we will advance interoperability and security through the signature of a new Memorandum of Cooperation on 5G Supplier Diversification and Open RAN. We are also deepening our engagement with industry, including through Open RAN Track 1.5 events, and exploring ways to collaborate on the deployment of open and secure telecommunications technologies in the region.</p>



<p>We have mapped the Quad’s capacity and vulnerabilities in global semiconductor supply chains and have decided to better leverage our complementary strengths to realize a diverse and competitive market for semiconductors. The Common Statement of Principles on Critical Technology Supply Chains, launched on the occasion of this Summit, advances our cooperation on semiconductors and other critical technologies, providing a cooperative foundation for enhancing our resilience against various risks to the region. &nbsp;Our cooperation in the international standardization organizations, such as the Telecommunication Standardization Bureau of the International Telecommunication Union, has made great progress, and we expect to strengthen such cooperation through the new International Standards Cooperation Network (ISCN). This cooperation will help ensure technology development in the region is guided by our shared democratic values. We continue to strengthen our horizon scanning cooperation following our deepened discussions in biotechnology through our efforts on mapping and a corresponding Track 1.5 and a future focus on quantum technologies. We will convene a business and investment forum for networking with industry partners to expand capital for critical and emerging technologies.<br><br><strong>Quad Fellowship</strong><br>We recognize that people to people ties are the bedrock of the Quad and welcome the official launch of the Quad Fellowship, which is now open for application. The Quad Fellowship will bring 100 students from our countries to the United States each year to pursue graduate degrees in STEM fields, and is administered by Schmidt Futures.&nbsp; The first class of Quad Fellows will begin their studies in the third quarter of 2023, and we look forward to building together a talented cohort of next-generation STEM minds who will lead our countries in cutting-edge research and innovation.<br><br><strong>Space &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><br>Space-related applications and technologies can also contribute to addressing common challenges such as climate change, disaster preparedness and response, and sustainable uses of oceans and marine resources. Each Quad partner will endeavor to improve public access to Earth observation satellite data and applications. We will work together to create an Earth observation-based monitoring and sustainable development framework.&nbsp; We will endeavor to share space-based civil Earth observation data, along with providing a &#8220;Quad Satellite Data Portal&#8221; that aggregates links to our respective national satellite data resources. We will work together to develop space applications, including in the area of Earth observations, and provide capacity building support to countries in the region, including with regards to partnering on using space capabilities to respond to extreme precipitation events. We will also consult on rules, norms, guidelines and principles for the sustainable use of space, and extend support to countries in the region through joint workshops including in relation to the UN Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS) Guidelines for the Long-Term Sustainability of Outer Space Activities.<br><br><strong>Maritime Domain Awareness and HADR</strong><br>We welcome a new maritime domain awareness initiative, the Indo-Pacific Partnership for Maritime Domain Awareness (IPMDA), designed to work with regional partners to respond to humanitarian and natural disasters, and combat illegal fishing. IPMDA will support and work in consultation with Indo-Pacific nations and regional information fusion centers in the Indian Ocean, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific Islands by providing technology and training to support enhanced, shared maritime domain awareness to promote stability and prosperity in our seas and oceans. IPMDA embodies what the Quad stands for: catalyzing our joint efforts towards concrete results that help to make the region more stable and prosperous.</p>



<p>Delivering on our commitment following our virtual meeting on 3 March 2022, we announce today the establishment of the &#8220;Quad Partnership on Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR) in the Indo-Pacific&#8221;. This Partnership will further strengthen our collaboration to effectively respond to disasters in the region.<br><br><strong>Closing</strong><br>Today, with a shared vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific, we once again emphasize the importance of fundamental values and principles, and commit to work tirelessly to deliver tangible results to the region. In doing so, we will regularize the Quad activities, including regular meetings by the Leaders and Foreign Ministers. We agree to hold our next in-person summit in 2023 hosted by Australia.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Kantei<br>Tokyo, Japan</p>



<p>10:35 A.M. JST</p>



<p>PRIME MINISTER KISHIDA:&nbsp; (As interpreted.)&nbsp; Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.&nbsp; President Biden, Prime Minister Modi, Prime Minister Albanese: I am delighted to welcome my friends to Tokyo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In particular, I thank Prime Minister Albanese.&nbsp; Welcome to Tokyo.&nbsp; I would like to offer him my sincere congratulations for assuming the post of prime minister, and thank you very much for flying over to Japan right after the election.</p>



<p>Since last year, with Joe taking the leadership, our four countries were able to meet from time to time at the leaders’ level.&nbsp; Japan is taking over the baton this year, and I am truly happy that this time we are able to hold the Quad Summit in Tokyo.</p>



<p>A grave incident which has fundamentally shaken the rule-of-law-based international order we value has happened since we met last September.&nbsp; Russian invasion into Ukraine squarely challenges the principles which are enshrined in the United Nations Charter.&nbsp; We should never, ever allow a similar incident to happen in the Indo-Pacific.</p>



<p>Because of the harsh reality unfolding, it is extremely significant for us to get together and show to the international society the four countries&#8217; solidarity and our firm commitment toward the shared vision of free and open Indo-Pacific.</p>



<p>Today, as we meet in person, I am looking forward for a candid exchange of views on global and regional situations.</p>



<p>At the same time, I must say that without walking in step with the countries in the region, we cannot secure success for the Quad either.&nbsp; We should therefore listen carefully to the voices of the countries in the ASEAN, South Asia, as well as the Pacific Island countries so as to further advance cooperation conducive in solving urgent issues facing the region.</p>



<p>During this meeting, I wish to clarify the concrete progress of broad-based practical cooperation that we have worked so far and also to discuss on new areas of cooperation such as assisting in regional climate change countermeasures, maritime domain awareness, as well as humanitarian aid and disaster relief.</p>



<p>Now, first of all, may I invite Prime Minister Albanese to speak, please?</p>



<p>PRIME MINISTER ALBANESE:&nbsp; Well, Prime Minister Kishida, President Biden, and Prime Minister Modi: Firstly, can I thank you for your sincere congratulations on my election as Australia&#8217;s 31st prime minister.&nbsp; It is an honor that this is my first act as prime minister to attend this important Quad Leaders Meeting here in Japan.</p>



<p>And as we gather today, I acknowledge all that the Quad has achieved, standing together for a free, open, and resilient Indo-Pacific region and working together to tackle the biggest challenges of our time, including climate change and the security of our region.</p>



<p>My government is committed to working with your countries, and we are committed to the Quad.&nbsp; The new Australian government&#8217;s priorities align with the Quad agenda, taking action on climate change and building a stronger and more resilient Indo-Pacific region through better economic security, better cybersecurity, better energy security, and better environmental and health security.</p>



<p>Our cooperation is built on the values that we share: a commitment to representative democracy, the rule of law, and the right to live in peace.</p>



<p>Today, we look ahead to the work we&#8217;re yet to do.&nbsp; As the Indo-Pacific is reshaped, our Quad partnership is needed now more than ever to meet the challenges and threats of a less certain world; to shape that world for the better; and build a stronger, more cooperative Indo-Pacific region that respects sovereignty.</p>



<p>The region is looking to us to work with them and to lead by example.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why my government will take ambitious action on climate change and increase our support to partners in the region as they work to address it, including with new finance.</p>



<p>We will act in recognition that climate change is the main economic and security challenge for the island countries of the Pacific.</p>



<p>Under my government, Australia will set a new target to reduce emissions by 43 percent by 2030, putting us on track for net zero by 2050.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have had a change of government in Australia, but Australia&#8217;s commitment to the Quad has not changed and will not change.&nbsp; And our commitment to ASEAN and its centrality has not changed.</p>



<p>My government has already committed to a greater focus on Southeast Asia, including the appointment of a special envoy for the region and $470 million in additional foreign aid over the next four years.&nbsp; This is in addition to our increasing assistance to the Pacific by over half a billion dollars, deepening our defense and maritime cooperation and using the power of proximity to strengthen our partnerships.</p>



<p>We will bring more energy and more resources to securing our region as we enter a new and more complex phase in the Pacific&#8217;s strategic environment.&nbsp; And we will continue to stand with you, our likeminded friends.&nbsp; And collectively, we will continue to stand up for each other.</p>



<p>We will stand firm on our values and our beliefs on what we know will enhance the stability and prosperity of our region and what is firmly in the interests of all those who call the Indo- Pacific home.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m honored to be among such close friends of Australia to take these next steps with you to pursue positive and practical ways to support a free, open, and resilient Indo-Pacific.</p>



<p>I look forward to strengthening our Quad partnership, starting with a productive meeting today.&nbsp; And I&#8217;m delighted to hand over to Prime Minister Modi.</p>



<p>PRIME MINISTER KISHIDA:&nbsp; (As interpreted.)&nbsp; Thank you very much, Prime Minister Albanese.&nbsp; May I now ask the Prime Minister Modi to speak?</p>



<p>PRIME MINISTER MODI:&nbsp; (As interpreted.)&nbsp; Your Excellencies &#8212; Prime Minister Kishida, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, and President Biden.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Prime Minister Kishida, thank you very much for your wonderful hospitality.&nbsp; I am very pleased to be among friends today in Tokyo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>First of all, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, my heartfelt congratulations to you on your electoral victory.&nbsp; <a>Your being here with us within just 24 hours of your swearing-in demonstrates the strength of our friendship within the Quad and your commitment to it.</a></p>



<p>Excellencies, the Quad group has made an important place for itself on the global stage in a very short time today.&nbsp; The scope of the Quad has increased and also it is more influential.&nbsp; Our mutual trust, our determination are giving democratic forces a new energy and enthusiasm.</p>



<p>At the Quad level, mutual cooperation is encouraging a free, open, and inclusive Indo-Pacific region, which is a shared objective for all of us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite the difficult circumstances of COVID-19, we have increased mutual coordination in several areas such as vaccine delivery, climate action, supply chain resilience, disaster response, and economic cooperation.&nbsp; This is ensuring peace, prosperity, and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Quad is moving forward with a constructive agenda for the Indo-Pacific region.&nbsp; This will continue to strengthen the image of the Quad as a force for good.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thank you very much.&nbsp;</p>



<p>PRIME MINISTER KISHIDA:&nbsp; (As interpreted.)&nbsp; Thank you very much, Prime Minister Modi.</p>



<p>May I now invite President Biden.&nbsp; Joe, please.&nbsp;</p>



<p>PRESIDENT BIDEN:&nbsp; Thank you very much.&nbsp; It&#8217;s wonderful to be together with friends and &#8212; at this transformative moment in the world, and we are at a transformative moment.<br><br>Prime Minister Kishida, I want to commend you for the extraordinary leadership that, over the past few months, you&#8217;ve shown and for the gracious way in which you’ve hosted all of us.&nbsp;<br><br>And, Prime Minister Modi, it&#8217;s wonderful to see you again in person.&nbsp; The &#8212; and I thank you for your continuing commitment to making sure democracies deliver, because that&#8217;s what this is about: democracies versus autocracies.&nbsp; And we have to make sure we deliver.<br><br>Prime Minister Albanese, I welcome you to your first Quad meeting.&nbsp; Like I said, you got on a plane &#8212; you were sworn in and got on a plane.&nbsp; And I’m &#8212; if you fall asleep while you&#8217;re here, it&#8217;s okay.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Because I don&#8217;t know how you&#8217;re doing it.&nbsp; But &#8212; (laughs) &#8212; it is really quite extraordinary.&nbsp; Just getting off the campaign trail as well.<br><br>Congratulations on your election.&nbsp; As I told when you won &#8212; I called you &#8212; that we greatly appreciate your commitment of being here so soon after taking office.<br><br>Quad leaders met for the first time just over one year ago.&nbsp; It seems longer, but, to date, our partnership is central to achieving our goals and critical for the foundation of our continuing cooperation, in my view.<br><br>We already accomplished a great deal, as was referenced earlier: cooperating on COVID-19 response and health security &#8212; more to do, to state the obvious; partnering on 5G and technology supply chains, technology standards setting; and launching our &#8212; our Quad Fellowship Program, which I think can make a difference, which we talked about earlier.<br><br><a>At the same time, we&#8217;re navigating a dark hour in our shared history. &nbsp;The Russian brutal and unprovoked war against Ukraine has triggered a humanitarian catastrophe.&nbsp; And innocent civilians have [been] killed in the streets, and millions of refugees are internally displaced as well as exiled.</a><br><br>And this is more than just a European issue; it&#8217;s a global issue.&nbsp; The fact is that what &#8212; if you turn on the television and you&#8217;ll see what Russia is doing now, it appears to me that Putin is just trying to extinguish a culture.&nbsp; He&#8217;s not even aiming at military targets anymore; he&#8217;s taking out every school, every churc<a>h, every &#8212; every natural history museum as if to try to obliterate the Ukrainian culture.&nbsp; And the world has to deal with it, and we are.&nbsp;</a></p>



<p>The global food crisis is made worse by Russia’s blocking Ukraine from exporting its millions of tons of grain.&nbsp; And also, as long as Russia continues the war, the United States will work with our partners to help be the global response, because it&#8217;s going to affect all parts of the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the same time, the United States must and will be strong, steady, and an enduring partner in the Indo-Pacific.&nbsp; We are in the Indo-Pacific &#8212; we are &#8212; we are an Indo-Pacific power.</p>



<p>I was once asked by &#8212; well, I won’t go into it.&nbsp; But I was once asked by the leader of China why I kept talking about being an Indo-Pacific power.&nbsp; And I said, “Because we are.&nbsp; We share the Pacific &#8212; one entire side of our country.”&nbsp; And we have been deeply involved with all of you for a long time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As long as Russia continues this war, we&#8217;re going to continue to be partners and gle- &#8212; lead a global response.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, you know, we&#8217;re an Indo-Pacific power, as I said.&nbsp; We&#8217;re going to stand with you, our close democratic partners.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re going to stand for the shared values that &#8212; and the shared vision we all have.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You know, shortly before Russia launched this invasion, my administration published our Indo-Pacific strategy to advance a free, open, connected, secure, and resilient Indo-Pacific.</p>



<p>Russia’s assault on Ukraine only heightens the importance of those goals &#8212; the fundamental principles of international order, territorial integrity and sovereignty, international law.&nbsp; Human rights must always be defended, regardless of where they&#8217;re violated in the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, the Quad has a lot of work ahead of us.&nbsp; It’s &#8212; the fact of the matter is &#8212; and we&#8217;ve a lot of work to do keeping this region peaceful and stable; tackling this pandemic and the next one; and addressing the climate crisis, as referenced by our new colleague; ensuring that technologies of the future are governed according to our values &#8212; governed according to our values.</p>



<p>But a short time &#8212; in a short time, we&#8217;ve shown the Quad isn&#8217;t just a passing fad.&nbsp; We mean business.&nbsp; We&#8217;re here to get things done for the region.&nbsp; And I&#8217;m proud of what we&#8217;re building together.&nbsp; And I look forward to our vital partnership flourishing and for many years to come.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>In Tokyo, President Biden, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese of Australia, Prime Minister Modi of India, and Prime Minister Kishida of Japan will advance the Quad’s ambitious and diverse agenda, including through a major new initiative to improve maritime domain awareness across the Indo-Pacific.</em></p>



<p>The leaders of the Quad nations—Australia, India, Japan, and the United States—will meet on May 24, 2022 in Tokyo for the fourth time and the second time in person. Established in the wake of the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami to coordinate humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, the Quad has since become a leading regional partnership dedicated to advancing a common vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific through practical cooperation on diverse 21<sup>st</sup>-century challenges. With six leader-level working groups—on COVID-19 Response and Global Health Security, Climate, Critical and Emerging Technologies, Cyber, Space, and Infrastructure—the Quad is building habits of cooperation among our four countries that will support a more peaceful and prosperous Indo-Pacific. President Biden and his fellow Quad leaders welcome the following announcements from the Tokyo Summit:<br><br><strong>The Indo-Pacific Partnership for Maritime Domain Awareness  </strong><br><br>At the Tokyo Summit, the Quad leaders will welcome a major maritime initiative: <strong>the Indo-Pacific Partnership for Maritime Domain Awareness (IPMDA).</strong> In close consultations with regional partners, IPMDA will offer a near-real-time, integrated, and cost-effective maritime domain awareness picture. This initiative will transform the ability of partners in the Pacific Islands, Southeast Asia, and the Indian Ocean region to fully monitor the waters on their shores and, in turn, to uphold a free and open Indo-Pacific. Quad countries are committed to contributing to the region’s maritime domain awareness—a fundamental requirement for peace, stability, and prosperity—through an investment in IPMDA over five years. The partnership will innovate upon existing maritime domain awareness efforts, rapidly bringing emerging technologies to bear for the greater good of the Indo-Pacific community.<br></p>



<ul><li>IPMDA will build a <strong>faster, wider, and more accurate maritime picture</strong> of near-real-time activities in partners’ waters. This common operating picture will integrate three critical regions—<strong>the Pacific Islands</strong>, <strong>Southeast Asia</strong>, and <strong>the Indian Ocean region</strong>—in the Indo-Pacific. The benefits of this picture are vast: it will allow tracking of “dark shipping” and other tactical-level activities, such as rendezvous at sea, as well as improve partners’ ability to respond to climate and humanitarian events and to protect their fisheries, which are vital to many Indo-Pacific economies. IPMDA will do so by:<br><br><strong>Harnessing commercially-available data</strong> <strong>using existing technologies</strong>. Through a combination of Automatic Identification System and radio-frequency technologies, Quad partners can provide an unprecedented “common thread” of activities. Because of its commercial origin, this data will be unclassified, allowing the Quad to provide it to a wide range of partners who wish to benefit.<br><br><strong>Extending support for information-sharing across existing regional fusion centers</strong>, such as the Information Fusion Center-Indian Ocean Region, based in India; the Information Fusion Center, based in Singapore; the Pacific Islands Forum Fisheries Agency, based in the Solomon Islands, and the Pacific Fusion Center, based in Vanuatu, both of which receive support from Australia.<br></li><li>Quad partners will begin immediate consultations on this opportunity with partners in the region. As the initiative proceeds, the Quad will identify future technologies of promise, allowing IPMDA to remain a cutting-edge partnership that promotes peace and stability throughout the region.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p><strong>The Quad Fellowship</strong><br><br>Quad leaders are proud to open applications for the <strong>Quad Fellowship</strong>, which will sponsor 100 American, Australian, Indian, and Japanese students to study in the United States each year for graduate degrees in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. The Quad Fellowship empowers exceptional STEM graduate students to advance research and innovation throughout their careers with a lens of positive social impact. It does so by providing scholarships, immersive and inspiring events at the nexus of STEM and society, mentorship and career-advancing programming, and cross-cultural exchange opportunities.</p>



<ul><li>The Quad Fellowship <strong>application </strong><a href="http://www.quadfellowship.org/apply"><strong>is live</strong></a> and will remain open until June 30, 2022. The first class of Quad Fellows will arrive on campus in autumn 2023.</li></ul>



<p><strong>The Quad Vaccine Partnership and Global Health Security</strong><br><br>The Quad is committed to maintaining its global leadership in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic and bolstering global health security. To date, Quad partners have collectively provided 257 million safe and effective doses to the Indo-Pacific. Even as we continue to donate vaccines, we will adapt our collective approaches to and prepare for new variants, including by getting vaccines, tests, treatments, and other medical products to those at highest risk.</p>



<ul><li>The United States will provide <strong>COVID-19 boosters and pediatric doses</strong> to countries of greatest need, including in the Indo-Pacific.<br></li><li>The <strong>Biological E, Ltd facility in India</strong> will continue to use expanded vaccine-manufacturing capacity as part of the Quad Vaccine Partnership. Our support is building sustainable manufacturing capacity, including for booster shots, which will yield long-term benefit in the fight against COVID-19 and future pandemics.&nbsp;<br></li><li>The Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) and EXIM India decided to support a <strong>$100 million facility</strong>, which will bolster the Indian health care sector, including global capacity for COVID-19 countermeasures.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Climate</strong><br><br>The climate crisis is existential for each of our countries and for the Indo-Pacific. The Pacific Islands are particularly vulnerable; as the Pacific Island Forum’s Boe Declaration on Regional Security <a href="https://www.forumsec.org/2018/09/05/boe-declaration-on-regional-security/">states</a>, “climate change remains the single greatest threat to the livelihoods, security and wellbeing of the peoples of the Pacific.” After inaugurating a <strong>Climate Working Group</strong> at our first-ever leader summit, in March 2021, our four countries have meaningfully deepened and regularized our cooperation on meeting the climate crisis. The Quad leaders will launch further efforts on green shipping, energy supply chains, disaster risk reduction, and the exchange of climate information services.</p>



<ul><li>The Quad will broaden and elevate our work to combat climate change by inaugurating two ministerials in the coming months. U.S. Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg plans to convene <strong>Quad Transportation Ministers</strong> and relevant stakeholders to accelerate the work of the Shipping Task Force, including progress toward developing Green Shipping Corridors among Quad countries. U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm plans to meet with <strong>Quad Energy Ministers</strong> to catalyze Quad efforts to deploy clean hydrogen, minimize methane emissions, and develop a 10-Year Clean Energy Supply Chain Plan.<br></li><li>The Quad will cooperate on disaster risk reduction for extreme weather events, including through the <strong>Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI)</strong>, building on the Quad’s joint session on strengthening Indo-Pacific infrastructure and communities at the International CDRI conference.<br></li><li>The <strong>Quad Climate and Information Service Task Force</strong>, dedicated to integrating and facilitating climate information services to the broader Indo-Pacific, will convene other Indo-Pacific countries at the September Asia-Pacific Ministerial Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction in Brisbane, to share best practices and gauge user needs in the region.<br></li><li>The Quad will advance the development of <strong>clean hydrogen</strong> and <strong>clean ammonia</strong> <strong>fuels</strong> and launch a series of roundtables on mitigating methane emissions across our liquified natural gas (LNG) sectors. The Quad will also cooperate to enhance capacity in the broader Indo-Pacific region to participate in high-integrity carbon markets.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Critical and Emerging Technologies</strong><br><br>Our four countries are committed to responsible innovation in critical and emerging technologies. Since launching the <strong>Critical and Emerging Technologies Working Group</strong> at the first-ever leader-level summit of the Quad, in March 2021, Quad partners have mapped collective capacity and vulnerabilities in global semiconductor supply chains, and launched the <em>Common Statement of Principles on Critical Technology Supply Chains</em>, which will provide a cooperative foundation for enhancing supply-chain resilience in the region. At the same time, Quad partners are exploring ways to collaborate on the deployment of open and secure telecommunications technologies in the region, working with industry through Open RAN Track 1.5 dialogues.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Through a new <strong>Memorandum of Cooperation on 5G Supplier Diversification and Open RAN</strong>, the Quad will cooperate on technical exchanges and testbed activity to advance interoperability and telecommunications cybersecurity.<br></li><li>The Quad has advanced technical-standards cooperation through the International Telecommunication Union’s Telecommunication Standardization Sector and will redouble its efforts through the new <strong>International Standards Cooperation Network</strong>, a mechanism for like-minded allies and partners to share information on technical-standards activities and to increase situational awareness, coordination, and influence in international critical and emerging technologies standards.<br></li><li>To unlock opportunities in critical and emerging technologies through stronger engagement with the private sector, the Quad will convene industry partners to discuss business and investment issues. A <strong>Quad Investors Network</strong>, an independent consortium of investors that seeks to advance access to capital for critical and emerging technologies within and across the Quad, is being launched today.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Cybersecurity</strong><br><br>The <strong>Quad Cybersecurity Partnership</strong> seeks to build resilience across our four countries in response to cybersecurity vulnerabilities and cyber threats. Its areas of focus are critical-infrastructure protection, led by Australia; supply-chain resilience and security, led by India; workforce development and talent, led by Japan; and software security standards, led by the United States. Its work is guided by <strong>new joint cyber principles</strong> to improve cyber resilience in a rapidly changing threat environment. These principles aim to prevent cyber incidents, prepare national and international capabilities for potential cyber incidents, and/or respond quickly and effectively to a cyber incident, when or should one occur.</p>



<ul><li>The Quad will strengthen information-sharing among Quad country <strong>Computer Emergency Response Teams</strong> (CERT), including exchanges on lessons learned and best practices.<br></li><li>The Quad will improve software and Managed Service Provider (MSP) security by coordinating <strong>cybersecurity standards</strong> for Quad governments’ procurement of software.<br></li><li>Quad partners will launch a <strong>Cybersecurity Day campaign</strong>, open to countries across the Indo-Pacific and beyond, as part of our continuing efforts to strengthen cybersecurity awareness and action. This program will provide basic cybersecurity information and training to the most vulnerable sectors of our countries and regions, including schoolchildren, small businesses, and the elderly. Quad partners will lead this campaign in partnership with industry, non-profits, academia, and communities to maximize its effectiveness and reach.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Space</strong><br><br>As leaders in space, Quad countries are strengthening cooperation and pooling our collective expertise to exchange satellite data, enable capacity-building, and consult on norms and guidelines.</p>



<ul><li>Quad partners will strengthen their commitments to the free, full, and open <strong>sharing of space-based civil Earth observation data,</strong> and will jointly develop and promote the concept of Open Science in the region and globally.<br></li><li>The United States will coordinate with Quad partners on its <strong>cooperative civil Earth observation programs,</strong> to include the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) GLOBE and DEVELOP programs; the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Community Satellite Processing Package (CSPP) and Satellite Proving Ground Flood Mapping Portal; as well as the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) National Land Imaging Program.&nbsp;<br></li><li>As extreme weather events become ever more common in the Indo-Pacific, Quad partners will convene technical experts to drive new cooperation and set the stage for additional <strong>disaster mitigation</strong> and <strong>humanitarian assistance and disaster relief</strong> workshops or training among Quad partners.&nbsp;<br></li><li>The Quad partners intend to host a two-day workshop on implementation of the <strong>Long-Term Sustainability (LTS) Guidelines for Indo-Pacific</strong> countries focused on LTS implementation and on how LTS implementation can lead to positive changes in domestic policy, regulations, and outcomes.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Infrastructure</strong><br><br>To help meet the Indo-Pacific’s enormous infrastructure needs, Quad leaders launched the <strong>Quad Infrastructure Coordination Group</strong>, which will deepen collaboration and pursue complementary actions, including in digital connectivity, transportation infrastructure, clean energy and climate resilience.</p>



<ul><li>In Tokyo, the Quad’s respective heads of development-financing agencies met to discuss enhanced engagement to address the infrastructure-financing gap in the region. This high-level effort—which includes Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Export Finance Australia; India’s EXIM; Japan Bank for International Cooperation; and the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation—will coordinate our strategic approaches, among our countries and with the private sector, to leverage solutions-oriented tools that support investments in critical sectors such as healthcare, clean energy and climate, digital connectivity, sustainable infrastructure, and supply chains.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief</strong><br><br>The Quad was forged in the wake of the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami. In recognition of that history and of present-day threats, the Quad established a new humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HADR) mechanism.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Through the <strong>Quad Humanitarian and Disaster Relief Mechanism</strong>, Quad partners will be able to coordinate and mobilize our civilian-led disaster assistance efforts, with support from civil defense and military assets when needed, to respond to disasters in the Indo-Pacific. The Partnership provides a framework for Quad partners to coordinate on joint disaster responses and develop a greater understanding of their respective HADR operations. Quad partners may provide joint or coordinated assistance as requested by an affected state in the crisis-alert, crisis-response, or post-crisis-review phases of a disaster. Quad partners will also be able to work together to improve crisis preparedness and early warning.</li></ul>
