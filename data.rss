<p>12:15 P.M. EDT<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Let me begin by saying to the press that I&#8217;m sorry that I’m late.&nbsp; We just learned a very close friend passed away: Rich Trumka.&nbsp; And he was more than the head of the AFL-CIO.&nbsp; He was a good, close, personal friend.&nbsp;<br><br>And the Vice President and I were talking a little bit, and he &#8212; he was with his son and his grandsons on a camping trip, and &#8212; and at least he was with the people who adore him.&nbsp;<br><br>But I apologize for starting late.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We&#8217;re sorry for your loss, Mr. President.<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Thank you.<br><br>The Vice President and I are honored to host leaders representing the rich diversity of Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander communities &#8212; many of whom I met before, some of whom I&#8217;m meeting for the first time &#8212; and I welcome again to the White House.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>We have a full agenda to discuss: the pandemic, the economy, immigration, voting rights, and hate crimes.<br><br>In fact, let me start by acknowledging that on this day, in 2012, I was with another friend who&#8217;s half Sikh &#8212; he&#8217;s a Sikh.&nbsp; And we were on &#8212; dealing with the 10 people shot in a hateful act of bigotry at the Sikh temple in Oak Creek, Wisconsin.&nbsp; Seven people lost their lives that day.&nbsp;<br><br>Today, we honor everyone impacted by this tragedy.&nbsp; And we think about all the pain during this pandemic, with the rise of hate crimes, harassment, bullying, and other forms of bias against Asian Americans.&nbsp; It seems not to stop.<br><br>And after the shooting in the Atlanta area, Kamala and I traveled to Atlanta, met with a group &#8212; some of whom are here &#8212; of Asian American leaders.&nbsp; The discussion was very raw.&nbsp; It was powerful.&nbsp; And a common theme was that Asian Americans feeling unsafe, unwanted, and some of you indicted feeling invisible sometimes.&nbsp;<br><br>Our message back to you was, at that moment: We see you.&nbsp; We see you.&nbsp;<br><br>A few months later, we stood here in the White House and we signed the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act into law.<br><br>It also was a powerful moment showing that we can come together &#8212; Democrat and Republican &#8212; we can come together as a nation and truly look out for one another.&nbsp;<br><br>You know, that’s why we wanted to convene this meeting to continue to strengthen our efforts because more must be done, in my view &#8212; our view.<br><br>A pandemic the AH &#8212; the AANI &#8212; -NH and PI community &#8212; I stumbled all over myself there &#8212; but has been on the frontlines from the beginning and is critical to helping us vaccinate America &#8212; not just get vaccinated but to vaccinate America.<br><br>The community is also critical in keeping the U.S. economy strong.&nbsp; In six months, we&#8217;re seeing the fastest growth at this point in any administration&#8217;s history &#8212; in no small part because of this community.&nbsp; The fastest-growing economic growth in nearly 40 years.&nbsp;<br><br>And now we have an opportunity to make historic investments in our infrastructure and in our families, and finally build an economy that deals everybody in &#8212; just doesn’t come from top down, but from the middle and the bottom up.&nbsp; And creating millions of good-paying jobs in every community, including the AANHPI community and delivering affordable childcare, paid leave, universal pre-K, as well as community college.&nbsp;<br><br>There is work to do on immigration; there’s work to do on voting rights and so much more.<br><br>On my first day in office, I signed an executive order to advance racial equity and a whole-of-government approach to address inequities and injustice in America from every agency.&nbsp;&nbsp;And this group&#8217;s input has been critical and continues to be critical to that approach.&nbsp;<br><br>And I look forward to the discussion that we&#8217;re about to have and the actions that, God willing, we’ll be able to follow.<br><br>So I want to thank you all again for being here, and we’ll get to our meeting.&nbsp; Thank you.<br><br>12:19 P.M.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>Last month, the President stood with Democrats and Republicans to announce the Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework – which makes the largest long-term investment in our infrastructure and competitiveness in nearly a century and is an important first investment to ensure the U.S. can tackle the climate crisis.</p>



<p>Last week, the President and Senators announced details of the historic investment, which includes historic components that will help combat climate change, advance environmental justice, and create good-paying, union jobs. From reducing greenhouse gas emissions across the transportation sector, replacing lead pipes to deliver clean drinking water, electrifying America’s power grid, and more, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal embeds key provisions that advance President Biden’s climate plan alongside his full Build Back Better Agenda.</p>



<p>President Biden promised to work across the aisle to deliver results for working families, and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal demonstrates we can come together to take key steps towards building an economy and country that is more sustainable, resilient, and just – all while creating jobs, furthering environmental justice, and addressing climate change.</p>



<p>President Biden believes we must invest in our country and our people by creating good jobs, tackling the climate crisis, and sustaining equitable economic growth for decades to come. The deal – along with his Build Back Better Agenda – will deliver progress towards this vision for working families across the country.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Modernize Public Transit and Reduce Emissions</span></strong></p>



<p>The transportation sector is the nation’s top contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, which we must reduce to ensure we meet President Biden’s goals to create a net-zero economy by 2050. And, America’s transit infrastructure has a multi-billion dollar repair backlog with more than 24,000 buses, 5,000 rail cars, 200 stations, and thousands of miles of track, signals, and power systems in need of replacement. <strong>The Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal makes the largest investment in public transit in history and is the largest federal investment in passenger rail since the creation of Amtrak – helping reduce greenhouse gas emissions when repairing, upgrading, and modernizing the nation’s transit infrastructure</strong>. The bill invests $105 billion in new funding to improve healthy, sustainable transportation options for millions of Americans by modernizing and expanding transit and rail networks across the country. It will replace thousands of transit vehicles, including buses, with clean, zero emission vehicles.  And, it will benefit communities of color since these households are twice as likely to take public transportation and many of these communities lack sufficient public transit options. In addition, it will help transit workers who are disproportionally workers of color. Bus and transit workers are 31% Black and 19% Hispanic, compared to 12% and 18% respectively of the workforce overall. <br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Build Up EV Infrastructure</span></strong></p>



<p>U.S. market share of plug-in electric vehicle (EV) sales is only one-third the size of the Chinese EV market. The President believes that must change. <strong>The bill invests $7.5 billion to build out the first-ever national network of EV chargers in the United States and is a critical element in the Biden-Harris Administration’s plan to accelerate the adoption of EVs to address the climate crisis and support domestic manufacturing jobs. </strong>The bill will provide funding for deployment of EV chargers along highway corridors to facilitate long-distance travel and within communities to provide convenient charging where people live, work, and shop.  Federal funding will have a particular focus on rural, disadvantaged, and hard-to-reach communities.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Electrify America’s Buses</span></strong></p>



<p>American school buses play a critical role in expanding access to education, but they are also a significant source of pollution. <strong>The deal will deliver thousands of electric school buses nationwide, including in rural communities, helping school districts across the country buy clean, American-made, zero emission buses, and replace the yellow school bus fleet for America’s children. </strong>The deal invests $5 billion in zero and low emission school buses, in addition to more than $5 billion in funding for public transit agencies to adopt low- and no-emissions buses. These investments will drive demand for American-made batteries and vehicles, creating jobs and supporting domestic manufacturing, while also removing diesel buses from some of our most vulnerable communities. In addition, they will help the more than 25 million children and thousands of bus drivers who breathe polluted air on their rides to and from school. Diesel air pollution is linked to asthma and other health problems that hurt our communities and cause students to miss school, particularly in communities of color and Tribal communities.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Reduce Emissions Across Airports, Ports, and Waterways</span></strong></p>



<p>The United States built modern aviation, but our airports lag far behind our competitors. According to some rankings, no U.S. airports rank in the top 25 of airports worldwide. Our ports and waterways need repair and reimagination too. <strong>The bill invests $17 billion in port infrastructure and $25 billion in airports to address repair and maintenance backlogs, reduce congestion and emissions near ports and airports, and drive electrification and other low-carbon technologies.</strong> Modern, resilient, and sustainable port, airport, and freight infrastructure will support U.S. competitiveness by removing bottlenecks and expediting commerce and reduce the environmental impact on neighboring communities.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Strengthen Resilience</span></strong></p>



<p>Millions of Americans feel the effects of climate change each year when their roads wash out, airport power goes down, or schools get flooded. Last year alone, the United States faced 22 extreme weather and climate-related disaster events with losses exceeding $1 billion each – a cumulative price tag of nearly $100 billion. People of color are more likely to live in areas most vulnerable to flooding and other climate change-related weather events. <strong>The deal makes our communities safer and our infrastructure more resilient to the impacts of climate change and cyber attacks, with an investment of roughly $50 billion.</strong> This includes funds to protect against droughts and floods, in addition to a major investment in weatherization. The bill is the largest investment in the resilience of physical and natural systems in American history.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Deliver Clean Drinking Water</span></strong></p>



<p>Currently, up to 10 million American households and 400,000 schools and child care centers lack safe drinking water. <strong>The deal’s $55 billion investment represents the largest investment in clean drinking water in American history, including dedicated funding to replace lead service lines and the dangerous chemical PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl).</strong> It will replace all of the nation’s lead pipes and service lines. From rural towns to struggling cities, the deal invests in water infrastructure across America, including in Tribal Nations and disadvantaged communities that need it most.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Address Legacy Pollution</span></strong></p>



<p>In thousands of rural and urban communities around the country, hundreds of thousands of former industrial and energy sites are now idle – sources of blight and pollution. 26% of Black Americans and 29% of Hispanic Americans live within 3 miles of a Superfund site, a higher percentage than for Americans overall. Proximity to a Superfund site can lead to elevated levels of lead in children’s blood. <strong>The deal invests $21 billion in environmental remediation, making the largest investment in addressing the legacy pollution that harms the public health of communities and neighborhoods in American history, creating good-paying union jobs in hard-hit energy communities and advancing economic and environmental justice.</strong> The bill includes funds to clean up superfund and brownfield sites, reclaim abandoned mine land and cap orphaned gas wells.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Electrify America’s Power Infrastructure</span></strong></p>



<p>As the recent Texas power outages demonstrated, our aging electric grid needs urgent modernization. A Department of Energy study found that power outages cost the U.S. economy up to $70 billion annually. <strong>The deal’s roughly $60 billion investment is the single largest investment in clean energy transmission in American history.</strong> It upgrades our power infrastructure, including by building thousands of miles of new, resilient transmission lines to facilitate the expansion of renewable energy. It creates a new Grid Deployment Authority, invests in research and development for advanced transmission and electricity distribution technologies, and promotes smart grid technologies that deliver flexibility and resilience. It invests in demonstration projects and research hubs for next generation technologies like advanced nuclear reactors, carbon capture, and clean hydrogen.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">BUILD BACK BETTER AGENDA</span></strong></p>



<p>Tackling the climate crisis and reaching President Biden’s goal of a net-zero emissions economy by 2050 requires&nbsp;<strong>consistent action</strong><strong>and historic investments in sustainable, resilient, and equitable infrastructure</strong>&nbsp;– and this deal is a critical step towards realizing these objectives.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>But we know there is more work to do</strong>&nbsp;– to grow our economy, create jobs, reduce climate pollution, and ensure more Americans can participate fully and equally in our economy.<br><br>In addition to the bipartisan deal, President Biden is dedicated to fulfilling his entire vision to tackle the climate crisis – which includes&nbsp;<strong>advancing his full Build Back Better Agenda&nbsp;</strong>that will:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Create an energy efficiency and clean electricity standard </strong>to send a market signal that bring additional private investment off the sidelines and into modernizing America’s electric grid – a key step towards reaching President Biden’s goal of 100% clean electricity by 2035.</li><li><strong>Extend and expand clean energy and EV tax credits </strong>for businesses and consumers to spur demand for domestic manufacturing, accelerate clean energy and EV deployment, and grow our capacity to build those technologies in the U.S.</li><li><strong>Enlist a Civilian Climate Corps </strong>to put a new, diverse generation of Americans to work conserving our public lands and waters, bolster community resilience, and advance environmental justice – all while paving the way for good-paying, union jobs.</li></ul>

<p>Over the next six weeks, more than 50 million students will head back to school, and more than 20 million students will return to undergraduate and graduate studies. For young people, getting vaccinated right away is the best way back to the things they love – like playing sports, completing their studies, and spending time with friends and loved ones. Today, the Biden Administration announced additional actions to get students ages 12 and above vaccinated and to ensure all students can go back to school safely this fall:<br><br>Today, the Administration is highlighting the following efforts to get more young people vaccinated:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Incorporating COVID-19 vaccination into sports physicals for student athletes this summer and fall</strong>: Today, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the American Medical Society for Sports Medicine (AMSSM), and ten other sports and medicine organizations are issuing a consensus statement to all their members urging all medical providers to ask about COVID-19 vaccine status during sports physicals, and where available to also administer the COVID-19 vaccine. Both AAP and AMSSM have issued updated guidance for physicians incorporating COVID-19 vaccination into sports physical protocols, and AAP has issued revised forms for doctors, parents, and student athletes to use to document their pre-participation examination including language on COVID-19 vaccination. The AAP estimates that approximately 60 to 70 percent of children and adolescents participate in organized sports across the country. Each year, millions of these student athletes receive a pre-participation exam, also known as a sports physical, in order to participate. This action will help elevate the importance of getting vaccinated against COVID-19 as a key part of safe competitive play. The organizations signing onto the consensus statement are:<br></li><li>American Academy of Pediatrics</li><li>American Academy of Family Physicians</li><li>American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation</li><li>American College of Emergency Physicians</li><li>American College of Sports Medicine</li><li>American Medical Society for Sports Medicine</li><li>American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine</li><li>American Osteopathic Academy of Sports Medicine</li><li>National Athletic Trainers’ Association</li><li>National Federation of State High School Associations</li><li>National Collegiate Athletic Association</li><li>U.S. Olympic &amp; Paralympic Committee<br></li><li><strong>Sending pediatricians to ‘Back to School Nights’ to get communities vaccinated against COVID-19</strong>: The National Parent Teacher Association (PTA) is calling on its 22,000 local member PTAs and parent leaders nationwide to host community conversations about getting vaccinated at Back to School parent meetings this summer and fall. National PTA will partner with the American Academy of Pediatrics to deploy local pediatricians to be a part of these Back to School parent meetings, so parents can have their questions answered by doctors who know and treat their children. AAP will also produce digital materials on the vaccine and kids that parent leaders can use as they convene community conversations. Alongside other trusted partners like teachers and school nurses, pediatricians around the country have been active in showing up to parent meetings and other events this summer to talk about the vaccine and how to keep kids safe in school this fall.<br></li><li><strong>Providing schools and colleges with additional resources to host pop-up vaccine clinics as students come back to school and back to campus</strong>: In an effort to get more kids 12 and older vaccinated, last week President Biden called on school districts nationwide to host at least one pop-up vaccination clinic over the coming weeks, and the Administration directed pharmacies in the federal pharmacy program to work with school districts and colleges across the country to host vaccination clinics on-site. Today, the Administration will release additional resources to help schools host pop-up vaccine clinics, including a detailed guide for hosting school-based clinics, template letters and text messages for district and school leaders to use in sending messages home to students and families about the vaccine, resources for teachers to use in discussing the vaccine with students and their parents, and materials parent leaders can use as part of community conversations on the vaccine. The Administration also released a “Vax to School” College Checklist, detailing eight ways that colleges and universities can increase awareness of and access to the vaccine as students come back to campus – building off of the work of the nearly 900 colleges in the COVID-19 College Challenge who have committed to building vaccination rates on their campuses this summer and fall. The American Rescue Plan has provided billions of dollars that school districts and institutions of higher education can use to create awareness and build vaccine confidence, host vaccine clinics, and provide incentives such as paid time off for staff to get vaccinated.<br></li><li><strong>Launching the Back to School “Week of Action”&nbsp;with partners nationwide to get young people vaccinated: </strong>Beginning August 7th and ending August 15th, the Health and Human Services’ We Can Do This campaign and Made to Save are launching a Week of Action to encourage vaccinations for young people and support parents and schools as they get kids back to safe, in-person learning.&nbsp; The Week of Action will mobilize school districts, students, teachers, national organizations, local government leaders, businesses, social media influencers, celebrities, and thousands of volunteers to kick off the school year by encouraging young people to get vaccinated and offering accessible ways to do it in their community. More than 90 youth-based organizations, faith-based organizations, and schools are committed to hosting over 200 vaccination events focused on school and campus-based COVID-19 vaccination drives for students, their families, and their communities, with hundreds more events taking place throughout the month of August. Events will take place all over the country, including canvassing, phone banks, text banks and more. As part of the Week of Action, Second Gentleman Douglas Emhoff and Education Secretary Miguel Cardona will travel to Topeka, KS to visit a back-to-school vaccine clinic; and trainings will be provided for teachers, parents, and student organizations on how to engage young people and their families on the vaccine. To kick off the Back to School Week of Action, the Second Gentleman and National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Dr. Anthony Fauci will host a virtual discussion with youth leaders who expanded access to the vaccine for young people and their communities. The Second Gentleman and Dr. Fauci will ask the young leaders about why they got involved in vaccine efforts, and how they have responded to the needs of their peers and their communities in getting more young people vaccinated. The virtual event will be livestreamed on the White House YouTube channel.<br></li></ul>



<p>Today’s announcements build on the Administration’s release earlier this week of the “Return to School Roadmap,” a resource to support students, schools, educators, and communities as they prepare to return to safe, healthy in-person learning this fall and emerge from the pandemic stronger than before. The Roadmap provides key resources and supports for students, parents, educators, and school communities to build excitement around returning to classrooms this school year and outlines how federal funding can support the safe and sustained return to in-person learning. Over the course of the next several weeks as schools reopen nationwide, the Roadmap will lay out actionable strategies to implement the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) updated guidance for K-12 schools, so that schools can minimize transmission and sustain in-person learning all school-year long.<br><br>The Roadmap includes three “Landmark” priorities that schools, districts, and communities are encouraged to focus on to ensure all students are set up for success in the 2021-2022 school year. These include: (1) prioritizing the health and safety of students, staff, and educators, (2) building school communities and supporting students’ social, emotional, and mental health, and (3) accelerating academic achievement. As part of the Roadmap, the Department will release resources for practitioners and parents on each of these priorities, and will highlight schools and districts that are using innovative practices to address these priorities. The Department will also lift up ways that the American Rescue Plan and other federal funds can be used to address these priorities in schools and communities across the country, as well as outline additional investments from President Biden’s Build Back Better agenda that are needed to ensure our schools and communities can rebuild from the pandemic even stronger than they were before and address inequities exacerbated by the pandemic, particularly for students in underserved communities.</p>

<p>Today, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. signed a memorandum directing the deferral of removal of certain Hong Kong residents who are present in the United States, giving them a temporary safe haven. This action demonstrates President Biden’s strong support for people in Hong Kong in the face of ongoing repression by the People’s Republic of China (PRC), and makes clear we will not stand idly by as the PRC breaks its promises to Hong Kong and to the international community. Since taking office, the Biden Administration has been clear that we, alongside our allies and partners, strongly oppose the PRC’s wielding of the National Security Law to deny basic rights and freedoms, assault Hong Kong’s autonomy, and undermine its remaining democratic processes and institutions. Given the politically motivated arrests and trials, the silencing of the media, and the diminishing the space for elections and democratic opposition, we will continue to take steps in support of people in Hong Kong.</p>

<p>MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF STATE                                                                                                THE SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY<br><br>SUBJECT:       Deferred Enforced Departure for Certain Hong Kong Residents<br><br>The United States supports the human rights and fundamental freedoms of the residents of Hong Kong.  Recognizing the significant erosion of those rights and freedoms in Hong Kong by the People&#8217;s Republic of China (PRC), I am directing the deferral of removal of certain Hong Kong residents who are present in the United States.<br><br>By unilaterally imposing on Hong Kong the Law of the People&#8217;s Republic of China on Safeguarding National Security in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (NSL), the PRC has undermined the enjoyment of rights and freedoms in Hong Kong, including those protected under the Basic Law and the Sino-British Joint Declaration.  Since the imposition of the NSL in June 2020, Hong Kong police have continued a campaign of politically motivated arrests, taking into custody at least 100 opposition politicians, activists, and protesters on NSL-related charges including secession, subversion, terrorist activities, and collusion with a foreign country or external elements.  Over 10,000 individuals have been arrested for other charges in connection with anti-government protests.  Over the last year, the PRC has continued its assault on Hong Kong&#8217;s autonomy, undermining its remaining democratic processes and institutions, imposing limits on academic freedom, and cracking down on freedom of the press.  <br><br>There are compelling foreign policy reasons to defer enforced departure for Hong Kong residents presently in the United States.  The United States is committed to a foreign policy that unites our democratic values with our foreign policy goals, which is centered on the defense of democracy and the promotion of human rights around the world.  Offering safe haven for Hong Kong residents who have been deprived of their guaranteed freedoms in Hong Kong furthers United States interests in the region.  The United States will not waver in our support of people in Hong Kong.<br><br>Pursuant to my constitutional authority to conduct the foreign relations of the United States, I have determined that it is in the foreign policy interest of the United States to defer for 18 months the removal of any Hong Kong resident subject to the conditions and exceptions provided below.<br><br>Accordingly, I hereby direct the Secretary of Homeland Security to take appropriate measures to defer for 18 months the removal of any Hong Kong resident who is present in the United States on the date of this memorandum, except for those: <br><br>(1)  who have voluntarily returned to Hong Kong or the PRC after the date of this memorandum; <br><br>(2)  who have not continuously resided in the United States since the date of this memorandum; <br><br>(3)  who are inadmissible under section 212(a)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) (8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(3)) or deportable under section 237(a)(4) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1227(a)(4)); <br><br>(4)  who have been convicted of any felony or two or more misdemeanors committed in the United States, or who meet any of the criteria set forth in section 208(b)(2)(A) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1158(b)(2)(A));<br><br>(5)  who are subject to extradition; <br><br>(6)  whose presence in the United States the Secretary of Homeland Security has determined is not in the interest of the United States or presents a danger to public safety; or<br><br>(7)  whose presence in the United States the Secretary of State has reasonable grounds to believe would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States. <br><br>I further direct the Secretary of Homeland Security to take appropriate measures to authorize employment for noncitizens whose removal has been deferred, as provided by this memorandum, for the duration of such deferral, and to consider suspending regulatory requirements with respect to F-1 nonimmigrant students who are Hong Kong residents as the Secretary of Homeland Security determines to be appropriate.<br><br>The Secretary of Homeland Security is authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the <em>Federal Register</em>. </p>

<p>As he continues to move at an historic pace with respect to judicial nominees, the President is announcing three new candidates for the federal bench and one new nominee to the D.C. Court of Appeals, all of whom are extraordinarily qualified, experienced, and devoted to the rule of law and our Constitution.</p>



<p>These choices also continue to fulfill the President’s promise to ensure that the nation’s courts reflect the diversity that is one of our greatest assets as a country — both in terms of personal and professional backgrounds.</p>

<p>This is President Biden’s sixth round of names for federal judicial positions, bringing the number of announced federal judicial nominees to 35.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">President Biden has spent decades committed to strengthening the federal bench, which is why he continues to move at an unparalleled speed with respect to judicial nominations.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to promote the interests of American workers, businesses, consumers, and communities, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;1. &nbsp;Policy.&nbsp; America must lead the world on clean and efficient cars and trucks.&nbsp; That means bolstering our domestic market by setting a goal that 50 percent of all new passenger cars and light trucks sold in 2030 be zero-emission vehicles, including battery electric, plug-in hybrid electric, or fuel cell electric vehicles. &nbsp;My Administration will prioritize setting clear standards, expanding key infrastructure, spurring critical innovation, and investing in the American autoworker. &nbsp;This will allow us to boost jobs &#8212; with good pay and benefits &#8212; across the United States along the full supply chain for the automotive sector, from parts and equipment manufacturing to final assembly.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is the policy of my Administration to advance these objectives in order to improve our economy and public health, boost energy security, secure consumer savings, advance environmental justice, and address the climate crisis.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) &nbsp;The Secretary of Transportation shall, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, consider beginning work on a rulemaking under the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (Public Law 110-140, 121 Stat. 1492) (EISA) to establish new fuel economy standards for passenger cars and light-duty trucks beginning with model year 2027 and extending through and including at least model year 2030.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c) &nbsp;The Secretary of Transportation shall, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, consider beginning work on a rulemaking under EISA to establish new fuel efficiency standards for heavy-duty pickup trucks and vans beginning with model year 2028 and extending through and including at least model year 2030.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sec.&nbsp;3. &nbsp;Heavy-Duty Engines and Vehicles Multi-Pollutant Standards for 2027 and Later.&nbsp; (a) &nbsp;The Administrator of the EPA shall, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, consider beginning work on a rulemaking under the Clean Air Act to establish new oxides of nitrogen standards for heavy-duty engines and vehicles beginning with model year 2027 and extending through and including at least model year 2030.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) &nbsp;The Administrator of the EPA shall, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, and in consideration of the role that zero-emission heavy-duty vehicles might have in reducing emissions from certain market segments, consider updating the existing greenhouse gas emissions standards for heavy-duty engines and vehicles beginning with model year 2027 and extending through and including at least model year 2029.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sec.&nbsp;4. &nbsp;Medium- and Heavy-Duty Engines and Vehicles Greenhouse Gas and Fuel Efficiency Standards as Soon as 2030 and Later.&nbsp; (a) &nbsp;The Administrator of the EPA shall, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, consider beginning work on a rulemaking under the Clean Air Act to establish new greenhouse gas emissions standards for heavy-duty engines and vehicles to begin as soon as model year 2030.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>President Biden Outlines Target of 50% Electric Vehicle Sales Share in 2030 to Unleash Full Economic Benefits of Build Back Better Agenda and Advance Smart Fuel Efficiency and Emission Standards</em></p>



<p>President Biden’s Build Back Better Agenda and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal invest in the infrastructure, manufacturing, and incentives that we need to grow good-paying, union jobs at home, lead on electric vehicles around the world, and save American consumers money. Today, the President will announce a set of new actions aimed at advancing these goals and increasing the impact of his proposed Build Back Better investments – positioning America to drive the electric vehicle future forward, outcompete China, and tackle the climate crisis.<br><br>Specifically, the President will sign an Executive Order that sets an ambitious new target to make half of all new vehicles sold in 2030 zero-emissions vehicles, including battery electric, plug-in hybrid electric, or fuel cell electric vehicles. The Executive Order also kicks off development of long-term fuel efficiency and emissions standards to save consumers money, cut pollution, boost public health, advance environmental justice, and tackle the climate crisis.<br><br>In addition, and consistent with the President’s <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/01/20/fact-sheet-president-elect-bidens-day-one-executive-actions-deliver-relief-for-families-across-america-amid-converging-crises/">Day One Executive Order</a>, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) will announce how they are addressing the previous administration’s harmful rollbacks of near-term fuel efficiency and emissions standards. Through these coordinated notices of proposed rulemaking, the two agencies are advancing smart fuel efficiency and emissions standards that would deliver around $140 billion in net benefits over the life of the program, save about 200 billion gallons of gasoline, and reduce around two billion metric tons of carbon pollution. For the average consumer, this means net benefits of up to $900 over the life of the vehicle in fuel savings.<br><br>These new actions – paired with the investments in the President’s Build Back Better Agenda – will strengthen American leadership in clean cars and trucks by accelerating innovation and manufacturing in the auto sector, bolstering the auto sector domestic supply chain, and growing auto jobs with good pay and benefits. That is why today, American automakers Ford, GM, and Stellantis and the United Auto Workers (UAW), will stand with President Biden at the White House with aligned ambition: supporting the President’s Build Back Better Agenda and the automakers’ need to invest in and grow good-paying union jobs in the United States.<br><br><strong><em>Build Back Better Investment Agenda</em></strong><br><br>The global market is shifting to electric vehicles and tapping their potential to save families money, lower pollution, and make the air we breathe cleaner. Despite pioneering the technology, the U.S. is behind in the race to manufacture these vehicles and the batteries that go in them.&nbsp; Today, the U.S. market share of electric vehicle sales is only one-third that of the Chinese electric vehicle market. The President believes it is time for the U.S. to lead in electric vehicle manufacturing, infrastructure, and innovation, by investing in:</p>



<ul><li>Installing the first-ever national network of electric vehicle charging stations.</li><li>Delivering point-of-sale consumer incentives to spur U.S. manufacturing and union jobs.</li><li>Financing the retooling and expansion of the full domestic manufacturing supply chain.</li><li>Innovating the next generation of clean technologies to maintain our competitive edge.</li></ul>



<p>Through the investments in the Build Back Better Agenda and Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal, we can strengthen U.S. leadership in electric vehicles and batteries. These once-in-a-generation investments will position America to win the future of transportation and manufacturing and create good-paying, union jobs, dramatically expand American manufacturing, make electric vehicles more affordable for families, and export our electric vehicles around the world.<br><br>And, the President has already made a down payment on his vision for U.S. leadership in auto manufacturing. Last month, the Department of Commerce announced $3 billion in currently available American Rescue Plan funds that can be used to advance the domestic electric vehicle industry in communities that have historically been the backbone of our auto industry.<br><br><strong><em>Electric Vehicles Ambition for 2030</em></strong><br><br>Over the last decade, we have seen a transformation in the technology costs, performance, and availability of electric vehicles. Since 2010:</p>



<ul><li>Battery pack costs dropped by 85 percent, paving the way to sticker price parity with gasoline-powered vehicles.</li><li>Average vehicle range increased dramatically as charging times shortened.</li><li>Electric models available to U.S. consumers expanded to over 40 last year – and growing.</li></ul>



<p>Seeing this shift, countries are sprinting to lead. For example, China is increasingly cornering the global supply chain for electric vehicles and batteries with its fast-growing electric vehicle market. By setting clear targets for electric vehicle sale trajectories, these countries are becoming magnets for private investment into their manufacturing sectors – from parts and materials to final assembly. &nbsp;<br><br>President Biden is committed to changing that and delivering for the American people. That is why he will sign an Executive Order that sets a new target of electric vehicles representing half of new vehicles sold in 2030. This builds on the announcements today from automakers, representing nearly the entire U.S. auto market who have positioned around the goal of reaching 40 to 50 percent electric vehicle sales share in 2030. More than a deployment target, it is a goal to leverage once-in-generation investments and a whole-of-government effort to lift up the American autoworker and strengthen American leadership in clean cars and trucks. The 2030 target is calibrated to provide time for existing manufacturing facilities to upgrade without stranding assets, upgrades that will be catalyzed by the Build Back Better Agenda, and lean into a path that expands domestic U.S. manufacturing with union workers.<br><br><strong><em>Smart Fuel Efficiency and Emissions Standards&nbsp;</em></strong><br><br>Consistent with the President’s Day One Executive Order, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and U.S. Department of Transportation’s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) will announce how they are addressing the previous administration’s harmful rollbacks of near-term fuel efficiency and emissions standards. The two agencies’ standards work in a compatible fashion through model year 2026, with the NHTSA proposed rule starting in model year 2024 and the EPA proposed rule taking effect a year sooner with model year 2023. &nbsp;The standards build on the momentum from “California Framework Agreement” – an agreement between the State of California and five automakers: Ford, Honda, Volkswagen Group, BMW, and Volvo.<br><br>Through these coordinated notices of proposed rulemaking, the two agencies are advancing smart fuel efficiency and emissions standards that would deliver around $140 billion in net benefits over the life of the standards, including asthma attacks avoided and lives saved, save about 200 billion gallons of gasoline, and reduce around two billion metric tons of carbon pollution. &nbsp;For the average consumer, this means net savings of up to $900 over the life of the vehicle from fuel savings.<br><br>Building on these near-term steps, the Executive Order that the President will sign kicks off development of long-term fuel efficiency and emissions standards to save consumers money, cut pollution, boost public health, advance environmental justice, and tackle the climate crisis.&nbsp; Specifically, the Executive Order lays out a robust schedule for development of fuel efficiency and multi-pollutant emissions standards through at least model year 2030 for light-duty vehicles and for medium- and heavy-duty vehicles starting as early as model year 2027. The Executive Order also directs agencies to:</p>



<ul><li>Consult with the Secretaries of Commerce, Labor, and Energy on ways to accelerate innovation and manufacturing in the automotive sector, to strengthen the domestic supply chain for that sector, and to grow jobs that provide good pay and benefits.&nbsp;</li><li>Engage with California and other states leading the way in reducing vehicle emissions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Secure input from a diverse range of stakeholders, including representatives from labor unions, industry, environmental justice organizations, and public health experts.</li></ul>



<p>Together, today’s announcements would put us on track to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from new passenger vehicle sales by more than 60 percent in 2030 compared to vehicles sold last year, and facilitate achieving the President’s goal of 50-52 percent net economy-wide greenhouse gas emission reductions below 2005 levels in 2030.</p>

<p>Today, automakers, the United Autoworkers (UAW), and other leaders, released statements on the Biden Administration’s steps to strengthen American leadership on clean cars and trucks:<br><br><strong>Joint Statement of Ford, GM, and Stellantis:</strong><br>“Today, Ford, GM and Stellantis announce their shared aspiration to achieve sales of 40-50% of annual U.S. volumes of electric vehicles (battery electric, fuel cell and plug-in hybrid vehicles) by 2030 in order to move the nation closer to a zero-emissions future consistent with Paris climate goals.  Our recent product, technology, and investment announcements highlight our collective commitment to be leaders in the U.S. transition to electric vehicles.  This represents a dramatic shift from the U.S. market today that can be achieved only with the timely deployment of the full suite of electrification policies committed to by the Administration in the Build Back Better Plan, including purchase incentives, a comprehensive charging network of sufficient density to support the millions of vehicles these targets represent, investments in R&amp;D, and incentives to expand the electric vehicle manufacturing and supply chains in the United States.  With the UAW at our side in transforming the workforce and partnering with us on this journey, we believe we can strengthen continued American leadership in clean transportation technology through electric vehicle innovation and manufacturing.  We look forward to working with the Biden Administration, Congress and state and local governments to enact policies that will enable these ambitious objectives.”<br><br><strong>Statement of UAW President Ray Curry:</strong><br>“We are at a critical time for the auto industry as countries compete to build the vehicles of the future. We are falling behind China and Europe as manufacturers pour billions into growing their markets and expanding their manufacturing. We need to make investments here in the United States.  Fortunately, President Biden recognizes the importance of this moment, and his Build Back Better Plan makes the bold investments in manufacturing, consumer incentives, and infrastructure needed to ensure vehicles of the future are made in our country.  Investments alone are not enough.  Today’s announcement on emissions standards brings more certainty and better planning for the auto industry and UAW member future jobs.  While the UAW notes that the companies have made voluntary commitments on Electric Vehicles, the UAW focus is not on hard deadlines or percentages, but on preserving the wages and benefits that have been the heart and soul of the American middle class.<br><br>“We must be ambitious not just about retaining good union jobs, but growing them, and about expanding U.S. manufacturing of electric vehicles, from parts to assembly. It is incumbent that these future jobs will be good-paying American union scale wage and benefit jobs that protect salaries and our critical health and safety standards.  The members of the UAW, current and future, are ready to build these electric cars and trucks and the batteries that go in them. Our members are America’s secret weapon in winning this global race.  That is why, today we stand with the President and support his ambition not just to grow electric vehicles but also our capacity to produce them domestically with good wages and benefits and the right to bargain and urge Congress to seize this opportunity for the sake of working people and our country’s future.<br><br>“Any auto industry transition to alternative fueled engines must be paired with passage of the Stabenow Amendment and passage or an agreement to adhere to the policies of the PRO Act to ensure these jobs of the future will protect UAW members, their families, and our American middle class. The Senate needs to pass the PRO Act and get it to the President’s desk for signature.”<br><br><strong>Joint Statement of BMW, Ford, Honda, Volkswagen, and Volvo</strong><br>“We were proud to stand with California to establish progressive new greenhouse gas regulations, and we remain committed to leading the industry in fighting against climate change. That’s why we support the Administration’s goal of reaching an electric vehicle future and applaud President Biden’s leadership on reducing emissions and investing in critical infrastructure to achieve these reductions. While the California framework companies are driving towards 40-50% of our sales being EVs in the next nine years, bold action from our partners in the federal government is crucial to build consumer demand for electric vehicles and put us on track to achieve the global commitments of the Paris Climate Agreement. That includes a strong nationwide greenhouse gas emissions standard, continued investments in charging infrastructure, and broad consumer incentives for all electric vehicle purchases.”<br><br><strong>Statement of Alliance for Automotive Innovation President and CEO John Bozzella:</strong><br>“Auto manufacturers are committed to a net-zero carbon transportation future, and we look forward to working with the Administration as we evaluate EPA’s proposed changes to light-duty vehicle standards for Model Years 2023-2026.<br><br>“Collectively, the auto industry has committed to investing more than $330 billion to bring exciting new electric vehicles (EVs) to market, including plug-in hybrid, battery and fuel cell EVs. And we support stringent GHG and fuel economy standards that are aligned and encourage continued improvements. As we look beyond 2026, the industry’s shift to electrified cars, trucks and SUVs will drive significant GHG reductions to fight climate change and make a better world for future generations. With the right complementary policies in place, the auto industry is poised to accept the challenge of driving EV purchases to between 40 and 50 percent of new vehicle sales by the end of the decade. Federal and state governments—and all stakeholders—will need to provide significant support for consumers, infrastructure and innovation. The auto industry has stepped up—investments in electrification globally will exceed $330 billion by 2025. But all levels of government will need to do their part for this challenge to succeed.<br><br>“The U.S. needs to rapidly expand its charging and hydrogen fueling infrastructure, retool existing manufacturing facilities and build new ones, prepare and position our workforce to lead this transition, and provide consumer incentives to make these vehicles affordable and accessible to a wide range of customers. Future GHG rules aligned with industry investment, and supportive governmental policies will be essential to significantly reducing GHG emissions, while maintaining a vital U.S. auto manufacturing sector and the millions of jobs it supports. We urge the Biden Administration and policymakers to continue advancing measures that will support the broad and equitable consumer adoption of electric-drive vehicles and that align environmental progress, vehicle affordability, and U.S. economic competitiveness.”<br><br><strong>Statement of California Governor Gavin Newsom:</strong><br>&#8220;California applauds the Biden Administration’s move to boldly reduce climate pollution from cars, inspired by California’s nation-leading framework. The climate emergency demands no less. Today’s proposal will help to clean the air and create a healthier future for our children and our planet. We look forward to continuing our decades-long collaboration with federal partners to build on California’s clean car leadership and deliver the investments needed to support the nationwide build-out of clean vehicle infrastructure.&#8221;<br><br><strong>Statement of Julie Cerqueira, Executive Director, U.S. Climate Alliance:</strong><br>“Strong vehicle standards protect our communities from unnecessary air pollution and fuel costs, and address the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. There’s much more work to do, but these new proposed rules are a critical step forward and will benefit our health, economy, and planet. Our states have been driving the transition to clean cars for many years and we look forward to working with the administration and continuing to lead.”</p>
