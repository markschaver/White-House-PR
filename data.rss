<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>President Biden also highlights $10 billion in American Rescue Plan funding already committed to public safety and violence prevention and praises those states, cities, and rural counties that have answered his call to action.</em></p>



<p>President Biden believes that Americans deserve to feel safe no matter where they live, and he is committed to using every tool at his disposal to fight violent crime. As the cornerstone of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/23/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-comprehensive-strategy-to-prevent-and-respond-to-gun-crime-and-ensure-public-safety/">comprehensive gun crime reduction agenda</a>&nbsp;he issued in June 2021, President Biden called on cities and states to dedicate American Recue Plan state and local funding to proven strategies that will make our communities safer –&nbsp;including by putting more police officers on the beat for accountable community policing, expanding evidence-based community violence intervention programs, and preventing crime by making our neighborhoods stronger with more educational and economic opportunities.<br><br>Today, President Biden is announcing that $10 billion in American Rescue Plan funds have been committed to public safety – including at least $6.5 billion in State and Local funds committed by more than half of states and more than 300 communities across the country, who have answered the President’s call.&nbsp;Along with ongoing state and local support from the Justice Department, American Rescue Plan investments made 2021&nbsp;among the largest single-year commitments&nbsp;of federal resources for state and local law enforcement and public safety on record.<br><br>This American Rescue Plan funding has been a vital lifeline to communities around the country, who have been able to invest in public safety at a time of tremendous state, local, and county budget uncertainty because of the pandemic.&nbsp;Before the American Rescue Plan passed, the Menino Survey found that 27% of mayors anticipated making significant cuts to their police budgets and services.&nbsp;<br><br>The American Rescue Plan has enabled these mayors and other state and local leaders to shore up their budgets and invest in public safety. Unfortunately, every Republican in Congress voted against the American Rescue Plan public safety funding for cities and rural counties across the country.<br><br>While Congressional Republicans try to pull back this funding,&nbsp;<strong>President Biden is today renewing his call for communities to invest more American Rescue Plan funding in strategies to make our communities safer and to deploy as many dollars as possible before the summer months when many communities historically experience a seasonal increase in violent crime.</strong>&nbsp;This renewed call to action comes as the Treasury Department is releasing the second tranche of support for state and local governments.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>$10 Billion in Already Planned ARP Investments in Public Safety &amp; Violence Prevention as President Biden Calls for Increased Investment:</strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>$6.5 billion in State and Local Fiscal Recovery Fund investments over the past year</strong>, by over 300 communities and more than half of states,&nbsp;including:<br><ul><li><strong>$1 billion in bonuses for front-line public safety workers</strong>&nbsp;to help recruit and retain these public servants.</li><li><strong>Over $2 billion to prevent crime and ease the burden on police</strong>, including community violence interventions, crisis responders, and substance use disorder and mental health services.</li><li><strong>Nearly $1 billion&nbsp;to reduce domestic violence</strong>&nbsp;with immediate crisis intervention, health supports and safety for victims of domestic violence</li><li><strong>Over $350 million in job training</strong>&nbsp;and other assistance to help formerly incarcerated individuals successfully reenter society and provide at-risk teens and young adults with meaningful job opportunities in the summer and during the year</li><li><strong>$450 million in public safety technology and equipment&nbsp;</strong>– like new police cars, upgraded radio systems, body-worn cameras, and gunshot detection systems&nbsp;</li><li><strong>$600 million to help clear court backlogs and support victims of crime&nbsp;</strong><br></li></ul></li><li><strong>Over $1 billion</strong>&nbsp;in proposed ARP investments in public safety have been documented this budget season. This understates the potential for new American Rescue Plan commitments to public safety. Indeed, for cities and counties, the numbers announced today reflect only the investments reported through 2021.&nbsp;<br></li><li><strong>$1.2 billion Medicaid Mobile Crisis Intervention Services</strong>&nbsp;– police departments are too often overburdened due to lack of crisis response support for people experiencing behavioral health crises. That’s why the American Rescue Plan included $1.2 billion to fund mobile crisis intervention units staffed with mental health professionals and trained peers.&nbsp;<br></li><li><strong>$1 billion Family Violence Prevention and Services Program&nbsp;</strong>to reduce domestic violence with immediate crisis intervention, health supports, and safety.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Examples of How Specific Communities Are Leveraging American Rescue Plan Funds to Shore Up Their Budgets and Make Our Communities Safer</strong><br>Today, President Biden will meet with mayors, police chiefs, and community violence intervention leaders who represent the following communities:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><strong>Houston’s One Safe Houston Plan – reducing crime in first 100 days: </strong>Mayor Sylvester Turner and Police Chief Troy Finner will describe the $52 million ARP plan to reduce violence, with $32 million in mental health and domestic violence response and victim service efforts, $11 million in police overtime (an additional 125 officers per day in areas of the most violent crime), $3 million for a new community violence intervention and prevention program, $1 million for a gun buyback initiative, $1.5 million for forensic science backlog assistance, $2 million for additional park rangers for park safety, and $1 million for a community reentry program.<br></li><li><strong>Kansas City, Missouri: Making Fiscal Room to Hire Up to 150 New Police Officers: </strong>Mayor Quinton Lucas and Police Chief Joe Mabin will discuss leveraging ARP funds to avoid public safety cuts and layoffs to and invest $10 million for new police radios, communication across departments, and how they are working toward providing hazard pay to police officers. The ARP was directly responsible for enabling the fiscal space for Kansas City to be able to hire up to 150 police officers, increase pay for officers and civilian staff, and budget $12.4 million for the Violent Crimes Division and $6.6 million for the communications unit and increased pay for 911 call-takers.<br></li><li><strong>Tampa, Florida: Avoiding Cuts in Public Safety and Investing in New Police Vehicles and Major Modernization of Fire Rescue: </strong>Mayor Jane Castor, a 31-year serving police officer and the city’s first woman to serve as police chief, and Police Chief Mary O’Connor will discuss the American Rescue Plan’s help in avoiding cutbacks of nearly $10 million in public safety while investing in police mental and behavioral health unit, body-worn cameras and new police vehicles. Tampa is also investing $13 million in a major modernization of Tampa Fire &amp; Rescue, including new rescue and fire vehicles, increased staffing during peak times, and fire station renovations. <br> </li><li><strong><strong>Detroit, Michigan: Increasing police patrols and expanding mental health response and community violence programs: </strong></strong>Mayor Mike Duggan and Detroit Police Chief James White began using ARP funds for public safety starting in July, 2021 and are continuing to expand public safety initiatives, with 6 primary strategies, totaling over $110 million. Investments include funds for an updated police training facility, $30 million for enhanced police patrols, $11 million for expanded mental health co-response, $12 million for community outreach gun violence prevention programs, $7 million for gunshot detection technology, $5 million for body cameras, and $8 million for firehouse expansion.<br></li><li><strong>Tulsa, Oklahoma: Police officer recruitment and hiring bonuses, new equipment and improved court processes. </strong>Tulsa Mayor G. T Bynum will share how the city has used ARP funding to provide $3,000 stipends for Academy Police Officer hires – with $2,000 at the beginning and $1,000 at the end of the Academy training. The city is also investing $7 million in body camera replacement and the police air support unit, as well as $6.5 million to reform and speed the court process. Finally, the city is investing in a new family safety center to reduce domestic violent crime. <br></li><li><strong>Baton Rouge, Louisiana: Investing in new police cars, increasing community policing, and innovative community violence interruption strategies. </strong>Baton Rouge Police Chief Murphy Paul, who is part of the White House’s Community Violence Intervention Collaborative, discussed the city’s major public safety investments, including $8 million to replace patrol and other vehicles, $3.3 million to implement gun violence reduction strategies and increase community policing, and $1.8 million for technology investments such as automated license plate readers.<br></li><li><strong>Toledo, Ohio: Funding training for a second cohort of new police recruits for the first time and plans for 100 new officers in the next few years. </strong>Toledo Mayor Wade Kapszukiewicz is leveraging ARP funds to not only avoid cutbacks and layoffs but used the additional resources to create a path to hiring 100 new police officers and invested $2.3 million in gun violence reduction strategies, including a violence interrupter program and other programs addressing root causes of violence, focused on neighborhoods with highest instances of gun violence. American Rescue Plan funds have allowed, for the first time ever, the city has funding to deploy not just one but two cohorts of new police officers, as it works to expand its police force. The city is also investing in gunshot detection technology and safety camera investments to tackle public safety issues.<br></li><li><strong>Mercer County, Pennsylvania: Nearly $12 million for a county-wide radio system and improved 911 system. </strong>Mercer County includes several rural towns, the largest having a population of just 18,000. The County Commissioner Timothy M. McGonigle will share the county’s nearly $12 million investment to design, purchase, and install a county-wide radio system to connect E-911, police, fire, and ambulance services.<br></li><li><strong>Milwaukee, Wisconsin: Bolstering Expanding Violence Intervention and Summer Youth Employment: </strong>Reggie Moore, former Director of Injury and Violence Prevention for the City of Milwaukee, will discuss how American Rescue Plan funds both from the state of Wisconsin and the City of Milwaukee are helping with Community Violence Intervention, summer jobs, and workforce opportunities for at-risk individuals. From Governor Evers’ $100 million anti-violence strategy, Milwaukee is receiving funding for a public health approach to violence prevention, that integrates licensed mental health clinicians into Milwaukee’s 911 center, and provides job training at Milwaukee County House of Correction, while using the city’s own ARP funds to invest in summer jobs for up to 1,500 young people. </li></ul>



<p><strong>Appendix: 40+ Additional Examples of Cities, Counties, and States Are Using American Rescue Plan Funding&nbsp;</strong><br></p>



<ul><li><strong>Allegheny County, PA</strong>&nbsp;has invested $10 million to provide radio equipment to over 300 fire, EMS and police departments throughout Allegheny County.

The funding will also support a recovery program designed as an alternative to jail for people who are experiencing a mental health crisis.<br></li><li><strong>Atlanta, GA&nbsp;</strong>has committed $7.5 million towards public safety and violence prevention initiatives, specifically community-based violence prevention programming. Atlanta will engage in street outreach and other holistic supportive services to actively remediate conflicts and prevent violence. The City plans to engage in the Cure Violence program model, an internationally renowned approach to violence prevention, leveraging disease control and behavioral health methods including conflict resolution, interrupting the transmission of retaliatory violence, and creating opportunities for community norms to change towards a nonviolence culture.

<p>It is with deep pride that I congratulate Admiral Linda L. Fagan on her confirmation by the Senate as Commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard. Admiral Fagan is the Coast Guard’s first woman to hold the rank of four-star admiral. Today, she again makes history not only as the first woman to lead the Coast Guard—but also as the first woman Service Chief of any U.S. military service. Admiral Fagan’s leadership, experience, and integrity are second to none, and I know she will advance the Coast Guard’s mission to ensure our nation’s maritime safety and security.&nbsp;</p>



<p>My administration is committed to seeing more qualified women in senior leadership and command roles; making sure women can succeed and thrive throughout their military careers. Today, Admiral Fagan’s confirmation as Commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard signals to women and girls across our nation they have a place in protecting their country at the highest level.</p>

<p>President Biden has directed the administration to work urgently to ensure that infant formula is safe and available for families across the country during the Abbott Nutrition voluntary recall.&nbsp; This has been &#8212; this is work that&#8217;s been underway for months.</p>



<p>Today, President Biden spoke with retailers and manufacturers, including the CEOs of Walmart, Target, Reckitt, and Gerber to call on them to do more to help families purchase infant formula.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He discussed Reckitt and Gerber&#8217;s efforts to increase production, which have made up for the loss of production by Abbott, and asked them to identify other ways the administration can help them on top of the actions being announced today.</p>



<p>The conversation with the CEOs of Walmart and Target focused on how they are working to stock shelves, including in rural areas, and any regional disparities they are seeing.&nbsp; And the President asked what more his team can do to help move product and get more product to those communities.&nbsp; He also announced additional steps to get infant formula onto store shelves as quickly as possible without compromising safety.</p>



<p>These steps include cutting red tape to get more infant formula to store shelves quicker by urging states to provide consumers flexibility on the types of formula they can buy with WIC dollars; calling on the FTC and state attorneys general to crack down on any price gouging or unfair market practices related to sales of infant formula, like third-party sellers reselling formula at steep prices; and increasing the supply of formula through increased exports &#8212; imports.</p>



<p>The Biden-Harris administration will continue to monitor this situation and identify other ways we can support the safe and rapid increase in the production and distribution of baby formula.</p>



<p>Today, we also marked &#8212; and you heard the President do this, this morning &#8212; a tragic milestone in the United States: 1 million lives lost due to COVID-19.&nbsp; Our hearts go out to those grieving a loved one and those families forever changed because of the pandemic.</p>



<p>As the President said this morning, we cannot grow numb to the urgency of this crisis.&nbsp; It is critical that we honor those who have been lost by doing everything we can to prevent as many deaths as possible.&nbsp; You saw that this morning from the President as he kicked off the COVID-19 Summit.</p>



<p>Today&#8217;s summit highlighted American leadership in action.&nbsp; Together with our co-hosting nations, we &#8212; we united the world to commit to vaccinating the &#8212; to vaccinating the world, saving lives, and building better health security with an inspiring response.&nbsp; We rallied $3 billion from other nations &#8212; more than three &#8212; 3.2 at this point in time, still counting &#8212; from other nations and partners around the world to address the global response.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And the President issued a stark warning about our ability to continue fighting COVID globally if Congress fails to act.&nbsp; As we heard through the summit, now is not the time for complacency.&nbsp; We need Congress to show up not with empty words, but with action, to fight COVID at home and abroad.</p>



<p>As we mark this tragic milestone, our hope is to avoid another tragic one like this, and that will only come if we act with urgency throughout the remaining fight against the pandemic.</p>



<p>Go ahead, Josh.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; Two questions.&nbsp; First, on the baby formula.&nbsp; Abbott says once the FDA gives them notice, it’ll take them two weeks to restart the site and then an additional six to eight weeks to get formula on the shelves.&nbsp; With what the President heard today, does he believe that we&#8217;ll have the tools to bridge what could be a two-month-plus shortage?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would say that the President is going to continue to use every tool we have in order to bridge that gap.&nbsp; And this has been work that has been underway for weeks and months now.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We know that as &#8212; if they get approval, obviously, as you noted, it will take them some time to get up and running again.&nbsp; So what we need to do, and what you&#8217;ve seen the President announce earlier today and I just reiterated, is steps we can take from here to increase supply, make sure it&#8217;s on the shelves.&nbsp; That includes increasing imports.&nbsp; It also includes ensuring we&#8217;re working with retailers, as the President did during his calls, to make sure that shelves are stocked.&nbsp; It also includes ensuring that lower-income families can access different brands of baby formula by working through &#8212; with the WIC &#8212; for the exemptions for the WIC program.</p>



<p>So, we recognize that this is certainly a challenge for people across the country, something the President is very focused on.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re going to do everything we can to cut red tape and take steps to increase supply on the marketplace.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, AAA is saying, you know, record-high nominal gasoline prices again today, but Americans are also seeing news about oil leases and auctions not going forward.&nbsp; What was the administration&#8217;s thinking on not having those auctions?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, the Department of Interior, who &#8212; they have put out some comments on this.&nbsp; And what they have made quite clear is that the Cook Inlet cancellation, which you&#8217;re referring to, was due to a lack of industry interest.&nbsp; And the Gulf sales were as a result of delays due to a number of factors, including conflicting court rulings.&nbsp; So those were the two areas where you&#8217;ve seen the pause.&nbsp; But there was not interest.</p>



<p>I would note that if we take a step back and look at what is available out there and look at the supply needed, as you noted at the top of &#8212; as part of your question, leasing and production offshore is a lengthier process.&nbsp; It can take up to 10 years to create supply.&nbsp; So, let&#8217;s start there.</p>



<p>Secondly, of the more than 10.9 million offshore acres currently under lease, industry is not producing on 8.26 million acres.&nbsp; That&#8217;s about seven point &#8212; 75 &#8212; more than 75 percent that is non-producing.&nbsp; Of the 24.9 million onshore acres under lease, industry is not producing on 12.3 million acres.&nbsp; That&#8217;s almost 50 percent.&nbsp; And there are also over 9,000 onshore permits that have been approved and are waiting to be used onshore.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, just to reiterate what we expect: U.S. production is expected to increase by over 1 million barrels a day this year and hit a new record &#8212; record next year.&nbsp; This &#8212; these specific actions were as a result of lack of industry interest and a &#8212; and conflicting court rulings.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; I guess, sort of the bottom line is, you know &#8212; on formula &#8212; this is a problem.&nbsp; I mean, I think other parents here in the room can probably attest.&nbsp; I, myself, went to three stores this morning, still haven&#8217;t found what &#8212; what we need.&nbsp; When will parents be able to get the formula they need?&nbsp; What is your best sense of when store shelves will be stocked again?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I think it&#8217;s also important to note that the reason we&#8217;re here is because the FDA took a step to ensure that babies were taking safe formula.&nbsp; There were babies who died from taking this formula, so they were doing their jobs.</p>



<p>We have been working &#8212; this administration has been working for weeks now to address in anticipation of where we thought there could be shortages.&nbsp; We have also seen an increase over the last four weeks of supply available, which has been an increase over the four weeks prior to the recall.&nbsp; That is a good sign.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But obviously the steps the President took today are an acknowledgement and a recognition that more needs to be done, that we do not want parents, mothers, families out there to be stressed and worried about feeding their babies.&nbsp; That is why the President today had conversations with the CEOs of Walmart and Target, why he had conversations with Reckitt and Gerber about efforts to increase production, why we&#8217;re taking steps to ensure that we are making &#8212; we are making WIC dollars available to a range of other supply.</p>



<p>So, we&#8217;re working.&nbsp; We&#8217;re seeing increases over the last couple of weeks.&nbsp; More needs to be done.&nbsp; We&#8217;re going to cut every element of red tape we can cut.&nbsp; We&#8217;re going to work with manufacturers.&nbsp; We&#8217;re going to import more to expedite this as quickly as possible.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But if you are a parent who is looking for formula right now, struggling to find what you need, do you have even a rough guess of how long these shortages are going to last?&nbsp; What should parents be bracing for here?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, we&#8217;ve already seen an increase in supply over the past couple of weeks.&nbsp; What we are seeing, which is an enormous problem, is hoarding.&nbsp; People hoarding because they&#8217;re fearful &#8212; that is one element of it &#8212; and people hoarding because they are trying to profit off of fearful parents.&nbsp; So that is also something we&#8217;re focused on taking efforts to track and adjust &#8212; and address and look into.</p>



<p>But again, more infant formula has been produced in the last four weeks than in the four weeks preceding the recall.&nbsp; We&#8217;re taking every step to increase that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, our message to parents is: We hear you, we want to do everything we can, and we&#8217;re going to cut every element of red tape to help address this and make it better for you to get formula on the shelves.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And as you mentioned, this obviously stems from the FDA taking necessary steps to try and deal with a very serious problem.&nbsp; And as Josh noted, you know, Abbott says that “subject to FDA approval,” they could restart at this site “within two weeks.”&nbsp; Do you have a sense of why it may be taking so long to get this factory back up and running or what the holdup is from the FDA&#8217;s perspective?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I would point you to the FDA.&nbsp; But, again, I&#8217;d go back to why this decision was made in the first place, which was to save babies&#8217; lives.&nbsp; And the FDA is not going to approve manufacturing again unless they are certain of the safety.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the President spoke with Philippines’ President-Elect Ferdinand Marcos last night, did they discuss either the dispute with China in the West Philippine Sea or the court &#8212; U.S. court judgments against the president-elect?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I&#8217;m not aware of those being a part of the discussion, but I can check and see after the briefing if there&#8217;s more details.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; And then, on NATO: If Finland and Sweden are successful in their attempts to join NATO, that would put the U.S. on the hook, again, for military &#8212; defending those countries, even potentially with nuclear weapons.&nbsp; What benefit is that to U.S. citizens?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, first, let me say that we would support &#8212; the United States would support a NATO application by Finland and/or Sweden should they choose to apply.&nbsp; We, of course, will respect whatever decision they make.&nbsp; Both Finland and Sweden are close and valued defense partners of the United States and of NATO.</p>



<p>I would note that even without them being members of NATO, our militaries have worked together for many years.&nbsp; We&#8217;re confident that we can find ways to work with them, address any concerns either country may have about the period now or whatever is required if they were to join NATO.</p>



<p>I would say, in terms of how this benefits the American people &#8212; I think is sort of what you&#8217;re asking about &#8212; having a strong NATO Alliance, a strong Western alliance &#8212; which is a defensive alliance, by the way &#8212; is good for our security around the world.&nbsp; And certainly, having a strong partnership with a range of countries, including Sweden and Finland, if they decide to join, should be reassuring to the American people about our own security interests.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, finally, when the President visits South Korea next week, does he intend to visit the demilitarized zone?&nbsp; And what&#8217;s your current assessment of the threat of a North Korean nuclear test?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, on the first question, we&#8217;re still finalizing details of the schedule for the trip and what it looks like.&nbsp; Obviously, that is a step that is taken by many who visit the region.&nbsp; But I expect we&#8217;ll have our National Security Advisor here in the briefing room next week with Karine to preview the trip.</p>



<p>In terms of whether we expect a test, we &#8212; the United States assesses that the Democratic Repub- &#8212; People&#8217;s Republic of Korea could be ready to conduct a test there as early as this month.&nbsp; This would be its seventh such test.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve shared this information with allies and partners and are closely coordinating with them.</p>



<p>As you noted, the President is traveling to the Republic of Korea and Japan next week, where he will continue strengthening these alliances and make clear our commitments to the security of the Republic of Korea.</p>



<p>Our intelligence assessment is consistent with the DPRK’s recent public statements and destabilizing actions, including the test launch of multiple intercontinental ballistic missiles.</p>



<p>But this is information, again, we&#8217;ve shared with our partners and allies and, of course, will certainly be a topic of discussion when the President travels next week.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just one more on the baby formula shortage.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Obviously, some parents are feeling panicked and they&#8217;re feeling desperate.&nbsp; And a big reason for that is because there&#8217;s no substitute for formula if you don&#8217;t have access to breast milk.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m just wondering: If you&#8217;re a parent today and you go to the store, you can&#8217;t find any formula on the shelves, as is being reported across the country, what is the step that they should take?&nbsp; What is the administration&#8217;s guidance on the immediate step that they should take?&nbsp; Is there a hotline that they can call?&nbsp; Should they take a baby to the hospital?&nbsp; What should they do?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would say those are important public health questions.&nbsp; But what I can report on here, or what I can convey to all of you, is what we&#8217;re doing to address exactly that concern, which is taking every step we can to ensure there is supply on store shelves, and we have increased the supply over the last four weeks.</p>



<p>And as the President &#8212; as I noted at the top of this briefing, we&#8217;re going to take every step we can to cut red tape, to ensure we&#8217;re working with retailers like Walmart and CEOs, that we&#8217;re working with Reckitt and Gerber and others who can produce more to ensure we are getting supply out to stores and out to retailers so that parents don&#8217;t have that concern.</p>



<p>But beyond that, that&#8217;s what I can read out for all of you from here.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since you said it was a public health question, which agency should that question be directed to &#8212; just the very practical, immediate question of: If you can&#8217;t find formula and you need it for your baby to eat, what should they be doing?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We would certainly encourage any parent who has concerns about their child&#8217;s health or wellbeing to call their doctor or pediatrician.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I just had one more.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just quickly on the student loan debt cancellation, can you give us a sense of whether the President is any closer to making a decision and just sort of his frame of mind as he&#8217;s thinking about what amount he would be willing to cancel?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I think as I&#8217;ve mentioned in here before, on the campaign, when he was talking about student loans, he talked about a frame of about $125,000 a year.&nbsp; That is not related to necessarily what this final policy will look like, but I&#8217;ve used that as a point of reference to remind everyone &#8212; some who covered the campaign and some who did not &#8212; that he&#8217;s always felt it should be targeted, this type of relief, and focused on the people who need help the most.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t have any update on a final decision.&nbsp; I would remind you all that, again, no one has paid a dime in federal student loans since the President took office, and he&#8217;s continuing to consider a range of options and policy here.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the formula shortage, just two quick ones.&nbsp; You said that this has been something that&#8217;s been in the works for several months, mostly through the FDA.&nbsp; When was the first time the President was briefed on the shortage?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I&#8217;m not going to get into internal briefings.&nbsp; He&#8217;s been made aware of it through the process.&nbsp; And there’s been steps &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before this week?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; It would have been, yes.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Has there been any consideration of using the Defense Production Act to accelerate production?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; There are a range of &#8212; there are a range of options, including that, under consideration, Ed.&nbsp; But I would note the issue here is that a manufacturer was taken offline because they did not produce a safe baby formula.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So what we&#8217;re doing here at this point in time is working with other manufacturers who can produce safe baby formula.&nbsp; And we&#8217;ve had success in increasing our productivity &#8212; their productivity over the last four weeks, and we&#8217;re going to continue to work on that.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But he would have known about this before this week.&nbsp; It wasn&#8217;t like this suddenly popped up.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; This has been something the administration has been working on for some time now.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; On Ukraine: Senator Rand Paul has delayed passage of the aid for Ukraine by insisting a new inse- &#8212; inspector general be established to track how the taxpayer money is being spent on the war.&nbsp; It&#8217;s going to delay passage of this probably now until next week.&nbsp; Would the President support establishing some kind of watchdog office to track this?&nbsp; We&#8217;ve asked about this before; it&#8217;s now a congressional issue.&nbsp; Any consideration of that?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would say that we agree oversight is critical.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why the package already includes millions of dollars to support additional oversight measures, including additional funding for existing inspectors general.&nbsp; And we encourage all senators to promptly pass the bill as it stands.&nbsp; We feel what&#8217;s in there is sufficient.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And one other thing that was left out of it, at least in the House, was an attempt to legalize the status of tens of thousands of Afghan evacuees brought into the U.S. last year.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does the White House see opportunity somewhere else soon to convince Congress to get that across the finish line?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We have been having conversations with congressional leadership about this &#8212; they are ongoing &#8212; on the best path forward for this and other priorities that were not included in the package.</p>



<p>We know this bill sends a clear message to Ukraine, to Russia, and to the world that we stand with the people of Ukraine.&nbsp; It doesn&#8217;t mean every component of it has everything we want in it, including that as an example.&nbsp; But it&#8217;s important to move it forward.</p>



<p>Go ahead, Jacqui.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.&nbsp; A couple of quick follow-ups on baby formula and then I want to get to something else.</p>



<p>It does seem like we should have seen this coming that maybe the FDA could have done more on the baby formula shortage.&nbsp; The whistleblower who used to work at that Sturgis plant warned the FDA top officials about safety concerns in October, but they didn&#8217;t interview that whistleblower until December.&nbsp; The inspection was until January 31st.&nbsp; The recall happened February 17th.&nbsp; So is that timeline acceptable to the White House?&nbsp; And if not, what is the White House doing to correct that at the FDA?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I&#8217;m sure there will be plenty of time to take a look at if there are any issues that could have been improved here.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have any specific analysis of that at this moment in time.</p>



<p>What I will note is that there has been work ongoing on this for months.&nbsp; That&#8217;s how we increase the supply and how we&#8217;re able to, you know, increase the sales based on the month of April overall.</p>



<p>But there&#8217;s more that needs to be done.&nbsp; Clearly, we don&#8217;t want any parent to fear about not being able to provide formula to their child.&nbsp; And as I noted at the top, the President is, you know, leaving no stone unturned in addressing this.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn’t see anything in the factsheet related to possible antitrust concerns.&nbsp; According to one report, 89 percent of the market is controlled by four companies.&nbsp; I know the President has tried to increase competition in other areas where it&#8217;s consolidated, like meatpacking.&nbsp; So is there going to be any call for increased competition in that industry coming from the White House?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Jacqui, it&#8217;s a good question.&nbsp; I have not been made aware of that being a concern here, but I&#8217;m happy to raise it and see if there&#8217;s more to tell you.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then I wanted to ask &#8212; shift gears only slightly &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; to crack pipes.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Okay.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You said in February that no money from a $30 million harm reduction program would fund distribution of crack pipes in safe smoking kits.&nbsp; The Washington Free Beacon reported that they went to harm reduction facilities in five cities, and all of those facilities had crack pipes in their kits.&nbsp; HHS would not say which programs had applied for funding, and the recipient list is not out yet.&nbsp; So I&#8217;m just wondering if the White House can say if any taxpayer dollars paid for these crack pipes.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; No federal funding has gone to it.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And is there any oversight to ensure that when that money goes out for the program, that these organizations will not use federal dollars for crack pipes?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; This policy does not allow for crack pipes to be included.&nbsp; I would just note that this is a bit of a conspiracy theory that&#8217;s been spread out there.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not accurate.&nbsp; There&#8217;s important drug treatment programs for people who have been suffering from what we&#8217;ve seen as an epidemic across the country, and money is not used for crack pipes.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I wanted to ask about the President’s comments last night.&nbsp; He went off about MAGA again.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; MAGA king.&nbsp; King MAGA.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; He referred to former President Trump as the “ultra-MAGA king.”&nbsp; He&#8217;s been decrying ultra-MAGA Republicans and saying he’s going to be doing it more.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Mm-hmm.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Hillary Clinton expressed some regret not too long ago for referring to Trump voters as “deplorables” who couldn&#8217;t be redeemed.&nbsp; And considering that Trump got 74 million votes in the last election, I&#8217;m just wondering if this is the best strategy for Biden to win people over &#8212; win over support ahead of the midterms, especially given his inaugural theme being “America united”?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would say that the President is not afraid to call out what he sees as extreme positions that are out of line with where the American people stand, and whether that is supporting a tax plan that will raise taxes on 75 million Americans making less than $100,000 a year; or whether it is supporting efforts to overturn Roe v. Wade, something that two thirds of the American people in a Fox News Poll, may I add, supported.&nbsp; And there are countless examples from there.</p>



<p>The President believes that there is still work we can do together.&nbsp; The Bipartisan Innovation Act is a good example of that.&nbsp; But, again, he is not going to stand back and stand aside while people are pushing for extreme positions that are not in the interests or supported by the vast majority of the American people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On inflation, today, Ro Khanna &#8212; just sort of feeding into his comments about last night &#8212; from last night about inflation &#8212; and the President was talking about the economy when he was referring to ultra-MAGA.&nbsp; And Ro Khanna said today that “blaming Putin may not be effective.”&nbsp; He said, “We need to say inflation is a real threat.&nbsp; It&#8217;s an emergency.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>So it seems like the President has been ratcheting up this rhetoric &#8212; you know, blaming Republicans, blaming Putin.&nbsp; We’ve heard all of the reasons why the pandemic is a factor.&nbsp; But Ro Khanna is asking, you know, this White House to call inflation an emergency and call up the National Guard to help with supply chains.&nbsp; Are those things that you’d consider &#8212; this White House would consider?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;Jacqui, I don&#8217;t think anyone doesn&#8217;t think inflation is an issue.&nbsp; The President has said that countless times.&nbsp; The question is &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it an “emergency,” though?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; It doesn’t matter what you call it.&nbsp; The President just gave a speech on it yesterday.&nbsp; The issue &#8212; the question is what is your plan to address it?&nbsp;</p>



<p>He laid out a very &#8212; a multipart plan yesterday.&nbsp; He has taken a range of steps, including steps that he even announced this week to lower the price of high-speed Internet for tens of millions of Americans; to give farmers the tools and resources they need to boost production; to lower the deficit, something that happened on his watch last year, which will help; to release 1 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve; to fix the “family glitch.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>What is the plan on the other side?&nbsp; We all recognize it&#8217;s a problem.&nbsp; But if you open the cupboard door, there&#8217;s nothing there.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s the issue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, the flags are flying at half-staff above the White House and at federal locations across the country.&nbsp; Kristin Urquiza &#8212; her dad died in June of 2020.&nbsp; You likely know he was in an Arizona hospital.&nbsp; The only person there to hold his hand in the ICU was the nurse.&nbsp; She is now the founder of a group called “Marked By COVID.”&nbsp; They have about 100,000 members right now.&nbsp; They&#8217;re advocating for a National Day of Remembrance &#8212; a COVID Memorial Day of sorts.&nbsp; Does the President support a national day of remembrance, a COVID Memorial Day?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, Peter, I would say that we&#8217;re still in a fight against COVID and a battle against COVID.&nbsp; There are still far too many people getting sick, getting hospitalized, and dying.&nbsp; And this is not the last time we will commemorate or the last step that the President will take to commemorate.&nbsp; But I don&#8217;t have anything to predict about the future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I imagine the same applies to a COVID monument.&nbsp; Right?&nbsp; You don&#8217;t have any decisions made on that?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Those are all important questions.&nbsp; And as the President has said before, people who have lost loved ones &#8212; obviously, a million lives have been lost; there are a lot of people across this country still in mourning.&nbsp; He recognizes that.&nbsp; We need to continue to commemorate that.&nbsp; But we&#8217;re still a fight &#8212; in a fight with the virus.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So on this day, 1 million American lives lost, an unimaginable figure.&nbsp; Only two-plus years ago at 400,000 lives lost, the President &#8212; then President-Elect and Vice President-Elect &#8212; were there at the Lincoln Memorial &#8212; 400 lights for 400,000 lives.&nbsp; For 500,000 lives lost, there was a moment of silence on the South Lawn.</p>



<p>Today was a bit different.&nbsp; His only public comments were prerecorded remarks to the Global COVID Summit.&nbsp; I guess I&#8217;m asking why not a more prominent remembrance for today&#8217;s anniversary &#8212; for today’s marking?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would say first, the President publicly addressed this day and marked it.&nbsp; We also lowered the flags for five days &#8212; they will be lowered for five days.&nbsp; And we will continue to mark and commemorate the lives lost.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What people care about &#8212; the country &#8212; though most is our action and what actions the President will continue to take.&nbsp; And, obviously, since he took office, according to a Yale study, it&#8217;s estimated we&#8217;ve saved over 2.2 million American lives and $900 billion in healthcare costs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There&#8217;s more work that needs to be done, more work to fight misinformation, more work to get more people vaccinated.&nbsp; And action is what people care about.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And people care about transparency, as you indicate as well.&nbsp; So my last question on this topic is: Can you help people better understand what data Dr. Ashish Jha was pointing to when he warned that the U.S. could potentially see 100 million infections in the U.S. if COVID relief isn&#8217;t passed now &#8212; over the course of the fall and winter waves expected?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; There&#8217;s a range of studies that are ongoing.&nbsp; Dr. Jha talks to a range of people internally &#8212; health experts &#8212; and externally.&nbsp; And this is in the range of what they have conveyed to him directly.&nbsp; And I expect there&#8217;ll be more studies that come out in the coming months.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; As you know, North Korea is on lockdown because a case of COVID there.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Just one case?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Remarkable.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The country &#8212; (laughter) &#8212; the country has previously rejected offers from COVAX for vaccinations.&nbsp; I’m wondering if the White House will launch a renewed push to try to get vaccines to North Korea.&nbsp; Obviously, almost their entire population &#8212; or their entire population has not been vaccinated.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah, you&#8217;re right.&nbsp; And as you noted, the DPRK has repeatedly refused vaccine donations from COVAX.&nbsp; We do not &#8212; the United States does not currently have plans to share vaccines with the DPRK.&nbsp; We do continue to support international efforts aimed at the provision of critical humanitarian aid to the most vulnerable North Koreans.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And this is, of course, a broader part of the DPRK continuing to exploit its own citizens by not accepting this type of aid.&nbsp; As you know, it&#8217;s not just vaccines; it&#8217;s also a range of humanitarian assistance that could very much help the people in the country.&nbsp; And instead, they divert resources to build their unlawful nuclear and ballistic missiles programs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But, yes, we support international efforts.&nbsp; No current plans for the U.S. to donate sp- &#8212; you know, from the United States supply.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then just briefly on crypto.&nbsp; As you know, the crypto market is in something of a tailspin.&nbsp; There has been an executive order that was put out in March to look into regulations and study the issue.&nbsp; Does &#8212; does the process need to be sped up now, given what we’re seeing?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, that was significant at the time &#8212; I know, it was, you know, only about two months ago &#8212; because there had not been an acknowledgement about the need to look into crypto &#8212; both the benefits and the challenges.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s an ongoing effort to do exactly that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I know that those who are running it from the Department of Treasury and otherwise want to make sure it&#8217;s thorough and that they&#8217;re assessing both of those important questions: the opportunities and the challenges.&nbsp; So I would point you to them on whether there could be any effort to expedite or whether that&#8217;s possible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rory Hu is from Nick News.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I know Rory.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve met.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know.&nbsp; She’s excited.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Rory, go ahead.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi.&nbsp; I just have a question and a follow-up.&nbsp; So, first, there are concerns about the negative impacts of social media on the mental health of children.&nbsp; Will the White House take any actions to prevent these adverse effects?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; As a mom myself, Rory &#8212; my daughter is younger than you; she’d think you were very hip and cool, no doubt &#8212; this is a huge concern that I have, we have, the President has &#8212; is the impact of social media platforms, their enormous power, and the fact that it is largely unchecked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is certainly something that our Surgeon General, Dr.&nbsp; Vivek Murthy, has talked about, in terms of the impact of social media platforms and what the impact they&#8217;re having on the mental health, the self-esteem of young people.&nbsp; And so, I would say the President, the First Lady, all of us believe that more needs to be done.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the Internet has become a tool for children&#8217;s education.&nbsp; A lot of students use the Internet to learn.&nbsp; So how will the White House prevent children from getting misinformed from the Internet?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Such a good question, too.&nbsp; Well, I know reporters, like yourself, and people that other kids listen to are good voices to provide accurate information.&nbsp; And you ask &#8212; coming here and asking tough questions is an important part of that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I would say that, you know, one of the things that we encourage parents to do is, you know, make sure you are educating yourself on all of these platforms and what information is available, and working with your kids to make sure they understand what&#8217;s accurate and inaccurate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are certainly steps the government can take.&nbsp; But there&#8217;s also an ongoing development of new tools.&nbsp; And we, as parents, need to keep educating ourselves about what&#8217;s out there so we can make sure our kids have access to good information, informative information &#8212; we watch a lot of animal videos in my house; that&#8217;s all good and positive &#8212; and not access to information that&#8217;s inaccurate and misleading or problematic.</p>



<p>Go ahead.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; She’s much better than Portnoy.&nbsp; So &#8212; (laughter) &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; Hard con- &#8212; hard confirm.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our friends at Reuters reported that there&#8217;s no executive order being drafted to give HHS and DOJ new powers to block Chinese access to vulnerable &#8212; to Americans’ sensitive information.&nbsp; And so, I was wondering if you have a sense of timeline on this.&nbsp; But also, the idea that there&#8217;s been frustration with the administration &#8212; frustration within the administration over some of the slow-walking at Commerce on rulemaking and investigations that that may have prompted this action by the President.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:  Well, I would say that, certainly, the protection of the privacy of American citizens and ensuring that no foreign actors, whether state owned or otherwise, have access to the information of Americans is of utmost concern to the President and to our National Security Advisor and others.<br><br>These processes can take some time to develop, to investigate, to finalize.  It’s not a surprise if there is a frustration by anyone who’s a part of that process.  But I can’t speak to that from here.  But I can tell you, certainly, ensuring we are protecting Americans’ privacy is of utmost concern to the President.<br><br>Q    A minister in the Bolsonaro government said that he may skip the Summit of the Americas coming up because he wants to campaign.  If he is not going, Mexico says that they may not go, and because Venezuela, Cuba, Nicaragua may not be invited.  Are we reaching a point where the summit may no longer be successful because so many key leaders in the hemisphere &#8212; even though ones, obviously, that the President has had key disagreements with &#8212; won’t be attending?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Well, no invitations have gone out for the summit, so that is obviously something that will happen in short order, given the summit is coming up in June.<br><br>I would note that Secretary of State Tony Blinken spoke today with his counterparts and reiterated not only his appreciation for the continued collaboration we have with Mexico but also noted that Special Advisor for the Summit of the Americas, Christopher Dodd, will travel to Mexico later this month to further discuss preparations for the summit.<br><br>So these conversations are ongoing.  Obviously, important questions about what the final invitation list will look like.  We are certainly eager to host the summit, something that, you know, is our highest priority for the hemisphere.  And it would be an important opportunity to talk about a range of issues, including democracy, including climate goals, including the COVID-19 response, and addressing the root causes of migration.<br><br>So we are fully planning and moving forward, but no final decisions about the invites have been made yet.<br><br>Q    And then a last one: There was a report earlier this week that the President may be meeting with or speaking to the King of Jordan.  Obviously, also, I think we asked last week about this possibility of a regional summit in Israel.  So I&#8217;m wondering if you could confirm either of those things, and, specifically on the last, whether Saudi Arabia is being weighed as a participant in that summit &#8212; oil production obviously a kind of primary concern for many Americans right now.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Yes.  Okay.  First, yes, he will be meeting with the King of Jordan.  I can get you the details of that after the briefing.<br><br>And on the second part of your question, I think you&#8217;re referring to what his travel might look like in June around the other summits.  We&#8217;re still finalizing what that looks like.  There have been good questions about whether or not he will go to Israel, given he has committed to Prime Minister &#8212; or, accepted the invitation of Prime Minister Bennett.  But that trip &#8212; we&#8217;re not quite there yet.  We&#8217;re still finalizing the next trip. </p>



<p>We have had senior members of the national security team travel to Saudi Arabia to talk about a range of issues, including regional cooperation, obviously the war in Yemen, and supply on the global marketplace.<br><br>But I don&#8217;t have anything to predict in terms of an upcoming visit by the President.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah, back on infant formula, Senator Gillibrand, in an interview with NPR, said that this is a “life or death issue” and that the other companies aren&#8217;t stepping up, they aren&#8217;t producing as much formula as they should or could be, and that she is going to ask the President to invoke the Defense Production Act on this.&nbsp; Is that the kind of request that will be entertained?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yes, we&#8217;re exploring every option.&nbsp; I think when you look at the Defense Production Act, you have to ensure that it would actually achieve what you&#8217;re trying to achieve.&nbsp; And so we&#8217;re also looking at that, as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And we have been working &#8212; this is one of the reasons, obviously, the President called CEOs today of some of these vital companies to determine what more can be done, because we know that with one major supplier having part of their supply off the marketplace, the &#8212; one of the easiest and fastest ways to address that is to increase supply from some of the other suppliers, and, also, to import more, which is a step we&#8217;re working to take as well.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They didn&#8217;t happen to ask him to invoke the Defense Production Act, did they?&nbsp; When &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I&#8217;m not aware of that being a specific ask from them.&nbsp; I can see if there&#8217;s more to read out from the &#8212; from the calls as well.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; And just quickly on the COVID deaths: Going back to the group Marked By COVID, they&#8217;re also asking the President to meet with people who&#8217;ve lost loved ones to, you know, express his empathy and also sort of feel what they&#8217;re feeling.&nbsp; When is the last time he met with the loved ones of people who have died from COVID?&nbsp; And would he consider such a meeting?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; He certainly would.&nbsp; And I think there &#8212; even people who may not like the President may &#8212; probably would not question his level of empathy and compassion for people who have lost loved ones.&nbsp; And certainly, addressing and talking about that impact is something you hear him do every time &#8212; nearly every time he talks about COVID.<br><br>He certainly would be open to doing that.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have anything to predict in terms of the future schedule, but yes.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, two of the &#8212; or, some of the steps, at least two of them, announced today on infant formula seem like things that could have been announced and steps that could have been taken earlier.&nbsp; And any woman following this on any mom&#8217;s list or whatever has known of rumblings of this crisis since nearly the plant shut down in February.&nbsp; Why &#8212; why did it take so long to announce the steps you announced today?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, again, some of these steps we&#8217;ve been working on, just because we haven&#8217;t been announcing them publicly, including increasing supply and working with producers and suppliers.<br><br>Some of the challenges we&#8217;re also seeing &#8212; let me just note it, and I noted this a little bit earlier &#8212; is this hoarding issue.&nbsp; And we are also &#8212; have been also calling on retailers to impose purchasing limits to prevent the possibility of hoarding, because we know that that is an issue.<br><br>Again, sometimes it&#8217;s people who are fearful, but &#8212; which is understandable.&nbsp; But also &#8212; it is also &#8212; there&#8217;s an element of people who are trying to benefit financially off of that fear, which is where we have a concern.&nbsp;<br><br>But since the reca- &#8212; recall, we&#8217;ve been working nonstop to address and alleviate supply issues by working with these retailers, engaging with the FDA on additional steps we could take, and obviously, we&#8217;re talking about laying all the specifics out now.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And briefly, on a different topic of “ultra-MAGA” &#8212; now, you saw Representative Elise Stefanik saying, “I&#8217;m ultra-MAGA, and I&#8217;m proud of it.”&nbsp; Former Trump super PAC blasted out a t-shirt of him as an ultra-MAGA Superman.&nbsp; He, on his own Twitter-alternative platform, released a meme of him as the ultra-MAGA king.&nbsp;<br><br>I guess I&#8217;m curious what the administration makes of Republicans and the former President sort of co-opting this and elevating what President Biden clearly intended as a pejorative.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I think if that means that the individuals you’ve mentioned are embracing their opposition to a woman&#8217;s right to make choices about her own healthcare, if they&#8217;re embracing a plan that will raise taxes on 75 million Americans, if they&#8217;re embracing the importance of fighting Mickey Mouse over virtually any other issue, I guess that&#8217;s their platform.&nbsp; Good for them.&nbsp; We&#8217;re happy to have a debate about that.<br><br>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, at the risk of sending you back to your State Department days, I was wondering if you could come back to the embrace of Sweden and &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; Finland for NATO, and walk us through the distinction now between their qualifications and Ukraine, now that we have invested so much more heavily in making sure that Ukraine remains an independent state and that it irreversibly could not be invaded again.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would leave that to my NATO spokesperson colleague to speak to.&nbsp; What I would say, David, is that what we support is a NATO application by Finland or Sweden should they choose to apply.&nbsp; We know that they have been close and valued defense partners.&nbsp; There are a range of requirements I&#8217;m sure my NATO counterparts could speak to, including addressing a range of issues like corruption and how you would participate in the defense of the collective NATO Alliance.<br><br>But I will let them to speak &#8212; speak to that.&nbsp; We, of course, support the NATO&#8217;s &#8212; NATO&#8217;s open-door policy and the aspirations of any country to apply to join.<br><br>But I think this speaks to our longstanding relationship and military partnerships with Finland and Sweden.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So you&#8217;re saying that for Finland and Sweden, you&#8217;re supporting their application, their right to apply, but you&#8217;re not embracing yet whether or not you would actually vote (inaudible).<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We would support a NATO application by Finland and Sweden, yeah.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; And then take that &#8212; the next step for us, if you can, which is to say that &#8212; you’ve heard what the Russians &#8212; how they reacted to this.&nbsp; Given the debate that took place back in the &#8212; 15, 20 years ago about expanding NATO, and the President&#8217;s concerns at that time, does he think that expanding it again just risks further provocation here?&nbsp; And is that &#8212; is the benefit at this point of having them in the Alliance greater than the risk of the provocation?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would go &#8212; I would just like to quote the President of Finland and what he said &#8212; which I don&#8217;t think I could state it better &#8212; in response to this question, which is: “As it relates to Russia, you caused this.&nbsp; Look at the mirror.”</p>



<p>And, you know, that is &#8212; NATO is a defensive alliance.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not an offensive alliance.&nbsp; Both Finland and Sweden are close and valued defense partners of the United States and NATO.&nbsp; They&#8217;re thriving democracies.&nbsp; They&#8217;ve worked closely with NATO for years.&nbsp; There&#8217;s no aggressive intent from NATO, from the United States, from Finland or Sweden &#8212; obviously they can speak for themselves &#8212; to Russia.</p>



<p>But again, this is President Putin who caused this.&nbsp; “Look at the mirror.”&nbsp; And I think that also probably is the reason for what you&#8217;ve seen as public support for joining NATO increase in these countries as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; One on the COVID Summit, and then, if I can, a follow-up &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; to what Tam was asking about the DPA.</p>



<p>During the summit today, did the U.S. hear any concerns from other countries about the delay in securing U.S. funding for the global effort or that there&#8217;s a potential that that funding will not come through if Congress doesn&#8217;t move forward on it?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have a thorough readout, and I’d point you to other countries to speak to what they did or didn&#8217;t express.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I would note that the Vice President, in her comments, specifically highlighted the need to get additional funding, including the $5 billion that is up for international COVID relief, which is part of the $22.5 [billion] we requested.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And she did that because there&#8217;s a recognition, an acknowledgement that we want to continue to be part of this effort to continue to lead this effort.&nbsp; And without that funding, we won&#8217;t be as well positioned.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I would note that what is a success from this summit is, of course, the fact that we have been able to put together $3.2 billion in contributions from a range of countries attending to this global effort.&nbsp; And that is part of &#8212; was part of the purpose to ensure that we were elevating this, working together, coordinating, you know, to prevent complacency, to prevent deaths, to prevent and plan for future variants.</p>



<p>And that kind of money from other countries is an important step forward.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And to follow up on the DPA question: Obviously, baby formula is a very specific product.&nbsp; But is there a lesson that can be learned from the COVID supplies of PPE and vaccines and scaling up production that the administration could apply to this situation right now?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; That&#8217;s a very good question, Karen.&nbsp; I think one of the challenges in this cycle of the supplies here is that companies are going to produce what the market needs.&nbsp; Right? &nbsp;And if you look at things like tests or masks &#8212; you know, back in the fall &#8212; remember? &#8212; we had a shortage of tests.&nbsp; This summer, we had an abundance of tests to the point where companies were shutting down manufacturing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, the challenge is &#8212; is that it&#8217;s about what the demand is in the marketplace.&nbsp; And obviously, now there&#8217;s high demand because there&#8217;s a shortage because of this recall, which was done, again, to save babies’ lives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, you know, clearly, our efforts and focus now is on increasing supply from other suppliers and importing more so that we can meet the current demand and needs now.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you so much.&nbsp; Another one on baby formula &#8212; that families with babies who are sick and relying on specialty mix &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; and that I understand that are only manufactured in this plant that is offline now.&nbsp; So what&#8217;s the plan for those families?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I addressed this a little bit yesterday or the day before &#8212; I guess it was the day before &#8212; which is: Part of our effort is to ensure and work with other suppliers, who can ma- &#8212; who make baby formula, who can meet the same needs of children who have special needs or who have specific needs for what formula they can take to ensure that supply is on the marketplace as well.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; And just on this &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; And the FDA has been doing that, but go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On this whole supply chain issue, we often hear the President saying the solution to supply chain problems is to produce in the United States.&nbsp; In this case, we have a product that is manufactured, I think, 98 percent in the United States. So how do you reconcile these two messages &#8212; you know, “Made in America”?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, there &#8212; because the reason for this shortage is not because there was a supply chain issue in a foreign country.&nbsp; That&#8217;s a different issue.&nbsp; That&#8217;s one supply chain issue.</p>



<p>This issue is because there was unsafe product that the FDA recalled to save babies’ lives.&nbsp; So, it&#8217;s just a different issue.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; A senior administration official yesterday said that the President&#8217;s trip to South Korea and Japan later this month is part of his plans to (inaudible) policy.&nbsp; And he&#8217;s the first administration to be &#8212; raise it to the leadership level.&nbsp; Does the President have plans to visit the other two countries &#8212; India and Australia &#8212; and when that is going to &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I&#8217;m sure he will in the future, but we have two foreign trips we&#8217;re still trying to finalize at this point, and so I don’t have any predictions about when.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it going to be in the first term of the President?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I can&#8217;t make a prediction of that.&nbsp; But there&#8217;s a lot of time left in the first term, so that&#8217;s the good news.&nbsp; A lot of time for travel.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the second question, what is U.S. expectations from India on the two wars the world is fighting &#8212; one is the Ukraine war, the other is COVID-19?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, we continue to remain in close touch with India about, you know, our efforts to rally the world, to stand up against Russian aggression.&nbsp; That means implementing and abiding by sanctions that have been put in place.&nbsp; And as you know, Daleep took a trip &#8212; our Deputy National Security Advisor took a trip just a few weeks ago there to have a conversation about that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We continue to encourage countries to speak out about Russian aggression.&nbsp; And obviously, on COVID-19, we&#8217;ve been an important partner with India in providing supply and vaccines and needs &#8212; in their times of need over the course of the last 15 months, and certainly we&#8217;ll continue to work with them on that.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; One on Finland, one on Israel.&nbsp; When Russia threatened military technical means against Ukraine many months ago, you were sounding the alarm bells, you were doing very specific projections as to what the Russians were going to do.&nbsp; They invoked that term again after Finland&#8217;s announcement. What do you make of it?&nbsp; What are your concerns about Russia&#8217;s response to this?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; About Russia&#8217;s con- &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About Russia&#8217;s response to a Finnish application for NATO membership.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would say that the facts are important here, which is that NATO is a defensive alliance.&nbsp; NATO has no aggressive intent, again- &#8212; against Russia, nor does the United States, nor do Finland and Sweden.&nbsp; We have long supported &#8212; before the invasion, after the invasion &#8212; the open-door policy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And certainly, given Finland and Sweden are &#8212; have longstanding important partnerships with the United States, with NATO countries.&nbsp; They&#8217;re longstanding democracies.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why we support their application.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But, you know, beyond that, I think it&#8217;s important to note what the facts are here, which is that there&#8217;s no aggressive intent at all.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the killing of Shireen&nbsp; Abu Akleh in Jenin, you called for an investigation &#8212; a swift investigation.&nbsp; I guess the question is: What kind of investigation?&nbsp; The Israelis have extended an offer for the Palestinians to participate in a joint investigation.&nbsp; Should they be accepting that offer?&nbsp;</p>



<p>And they&#8217;ve also asked for U.S. oversight over some examination of, for example, the bullet that killed Shireen.&nbsp; You know, what &#8212; have you responded to that offer?&nbsp; What would you like to see?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, we understand that both Israel and the Palestinian Authority are already conducting investigations into the circumstances of the killing.&nbsp; We encourage both parties to do so thoroughly and transparently and to share their findings to ensure that all evidence in this case is available and fully assessed.</p>



<p>We stand ready to assist either party in any way that we can.&nbsp; Neither side has asked for our assistance at this time, and such a request would be required in order for us to do so.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, as part of this ultra-MAGA rollout, the President has talked a lot about, sort of, what the Republican &#8212; what he thinks the Republican Party now stands for.&nbsp; He&#8217;s also, you know, thrown out some tough language, saying they were &#8220;petty&#8221; and &#8220;mean spirited&#8221; and, sort of, cowering to former President Trump.&nbsp; Does he &#8212; but he&#8217;s also said he&#8217;s been surprised by that.&nbsp; Does he still feel like the fever will break in Washington?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, you mean, in terms of the ultra-MAGA followers of the former president?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just in terms of if ultra-MAGA, you know, as he says, controls the party, that would be the party that he thought would come around.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I just want to make sure I understand your question.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sure.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Are you asking me if he thinks that there will ever be a period of time where there will not be a ultra-MAGA party or if &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does he does he feel like there will be a period in time when he is president in which the ultra-MAGA wing of the Republican Party doesn&#8217;t control it and that the fever will break in Washington?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, that&#8217;s certainly his hope.&nbsp; The President has long believed that Democrats and Republicans can work together &#8212; can work together to get things done.&nbsp; He signed 80 bipartisan bal- &#8212; bills into law last year.&nbsp; The Bipartisan Innovation Act is something we&#8217;re still working to get through.</p>



<p>And his view is that this is a conversation &#8212; a lot of it&#8217;s happening in Washington.&nbsp; And they are &#8212; for the American people and the American public, a lot of these policies that the ultra-MAGA wing, the MAGA King &#8212; all the different terminology where the President is using out there &#8212; does not align with where the vast majority of the public is, and elected officials should be doing what the vast majority of the public wants them to do.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does the White &#8212; I &#8212; and excuse me if you guys have already reacted to this: Does the White House have a comment on the latest round of subpoenas by the January 6th commission?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We certainly support the work of the January 6th Committee.&nbsp; We’ll continue to support their work.&nbsp; We believe it&#8217;s vital and essential to get to the bottom of what happened on January 6th, one of the darkest days in our democracy.&nbsp; So we&#8217;ll continue to support their work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, last question.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Okay, last one.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; Staying on ultra-MAGA and the Rick Scott &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Obviously, the President himself is not subject to the Hatch Act.&nbsp; But as the midterms start to take over basically everything, can you just talk about how the White House is navigating the distinction between political speech and official events?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; For the Pres- &#8212; in what the President is doing or how he spends his time?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In terms of the appropriateness of making explicitly political or campaign-focused messages during official White House events?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would say that I am subject to the Hatch Act, as I have noted &#8212; in a sternly written letter to me &#8212; but the President is not, as you know.&nbsp; And he is the leader of the Democratic Party.&nbsp; He&#8217;s also the Commander-in-Chief.&nbsp; He&#8217;s also the leader of the free world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And what he is pointing out is what he sees to be a troubling trend in our democ- &#8212; into our country that&#8217;s a threat to our democracy, a threat to progress.&nbsp; And certainly, he&#8217;s going to continue to draw the contrast for the American people on what the options present.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All right, I&#8217;m just going to do Patsy and April, because I &#8212; Patsy, go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.&nbsp; So, on the U.S.-ASEAN Summit, can you give us a sense of how hard the President will push on the issue of Ukraine?&nbsp; For example, whether the administration will be pushing to include the word “Russia” in the final communiqué.&nbsp; As you know, ASEAN have, so far, avoided using that word on any of their statements on the Ukraine crisis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I have a follow-up on Afghanistan, if you don&#8217;t mind.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.</p>



<p>So, on the ASEAN Summit, Ukraine will absolutely be on the agenda.&nbsp; In terms of what the final communiqué will look like, I don&#8217;t expect it will be ready for more than 24 hours.&nbsp; And there&#8217;s lots of conversations that need to happen between now and then, so I can&#8217;t make a prediction of it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But I will say that a number of the ASEAN participants have been important partners in calling out the aggressive action of Russia and invading Ukraine, in participating and in supporting sanctions and, certainly, abiding by them.&nbsp; And obviously, the conflict we&#8217;re seeing is a unique moment in modern global history.&nbsp; So it will certainly be on the agenda.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Okay.&nbsp; Go ahead.&nbsp; Last thing, and then I’ll go to April.&nbsp; And then I got to go.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you confirm reports that Jake Sullivan recently met with the chief of the Pakistani spy agency in Washington, D.C.?&nbsp; Can you share anything from that meeting and whether the two sides discussed counterterrorism cooperation in Afghanistan?</p>



<p><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have any details on that reported meeting.&nbsp; I can certainly check and see if there&#8217;s more.&nbsp;<br><br>Okay, April, wrap it up.</p>



<p><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Wrapping it up.&nbsp; I’m going to share on another meeting &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; if there’s more information.&nbsp; Congressman Greg Meeks, the chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, met with the President; he was part of a group meeting with the President this week.&nbsp; And he talked about issues that he talked with &#8212; was it President Zelenskyy.&nbsp;<br><br>And one of those issues that President Zelenskyy specifically brought up to Meeks and the contingent was Ukrainian grains and how it is impacting &#8212; the lack of Ukrainian grains going out to the world is impacting Africa.&nbsp; Meeks said the President spoke about it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Can you drill down a little bit more about this?&nbsp; Has &#8212; the President has said he wants it to go out to the world.&nbsp; Can you drill down a little bit more, especially when it comes to Africa?&nbsp; Because there&#8217;s a concern about many of those countries, to include Ethiopia and the Congo &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; that’s already going through crisis.&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah, it&#8217;s an important issue.&nbsp; We&#8217;re seeing food shortages in the world, including in parts of Africa, other parts of the Middle East.&nbsp;<br><br>This is one of the reasons why the President went to Chicago and raised the issue of doing everything we can to increase supply here in the United States.&nbsp;<br><br>While we don&#8217;t expect shortages here, we want to be providers of American grains to the rest of the world as we&#8217;re seeing shortages in part because of the war in Ukraine.&nbsp;<br><br>We&#8217;ve also provided a large amount of assistance to global food programs, global aid programs in anticipation of what we see as a potential shortage of food.&nbsp; And we&#8217;ll continue to work on it.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Cross-talk by reporter.)<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I’m sorry.&nbsp; I’m sorry.&nbsp; Does this give the President more pause that President Zelenskyy himself brought that issue of grain for Africa up &#8212; specifically Africa, the continent?</p>



<p><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, we are working on this issue and have been working on this issue for months now.&nbsp; That is &#8212; the President went on a trip just yesterday to elevate and talk about the steps we&#8217;re taking to increase supply of grains and wheat here in the United States to address exactly this issue.&nbsp; And we are far and away the world&#8217;s largest provider of assistance in aid to global food programs in order to address what we know could be a shortage around the world.&nbsp;<br><br>Thank you, everyone.</p>

<p>Today, President Joe Biden spoke with the leadership of Walmart and Target, and the infant formula manufacturers Reckitt and Gerber to receive an update on actions the companies are taking to address the shortage of infant formula caused by a voluntary recall of infant powdered formula by Abbott and the subsequent closure of its manufacturing facility in Sturgis, Michigan.</p>



<p>The manufacturers and retailers thanked the President for the actions his administration has taken—including those by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the U.S. Department of Agriculture—that has enabled them to serve the families in need, including low income mothers and children who are most vulnerable.</p>



<p>The President discussed Reckitt and Gerber’s efforts to increase production—which have made up for much of the loss of production by Abbott—and pledged to work closely with them to identify ways the Administration can help, on top of the actions being announced today. Both companies stated that they are operating 24/7 with Gerber, increasing the amount of their infant formula available to consumers by approximately 50% in March and April. Reckitt is supplying more than 30% more product year to date.</p>



<p>The conversation with the CEOs of Walmart and Target focused on how retailers are working to stock shelves. The CEOs discussed state specific disparities and the President asked what more his team can do to help move product and get more product to communities in need. These calls build off the work the Administration has done since February to increase the supply of infant formula.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>President Biden will welcome the leaders of the Association of Southeast Nations (ASEAN) for a historic U.S.-ASEAN Special Summit, held for the first time in Washington D.C. and at the White House, to re-affirm the United States’ enduring commitment to Southeast Asia and underscore the importance of U.S.-ASEAN cooperation in ensuring security, prosperity, and respect for human rights.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Over many years, the United States has steadily deepened our partnership with Southeast Asia. The United States has provided over $12.1 billion in development, economic, health, and security assistance to Southeast Asian allies and partners since 2002 and over that same period of time, the United States has provided over $1.4 billion in humanitarian assistance, including life-saving disaster assistance, emergency food aid, and support to refugees throughout Southeast Asia. Building on our long-standing commitment to this critical region, the Biden-Harris Administration’s FY 2023 Budget Request included over $800 million in bilateral assistance for ASEAN partners and over $25 million to deepen relations with ASEAN and enhance ASEAN’s capacity to tackle pressing regional challenges.&nbsp;<br><br>The United States and Southeast Asia also benefit from our far-reaching commercial and trade ties. ASEAN represents the world’s fourth largest market and the United States is ASEAN’s largest source of foreign direct investment, while our two-way trade amounted to over $360 billion in 2020.&nbsp;<br><br>U.S.-ASEAN relations are ultimately anchored in the special friendship shared by our combined one billion people. Our ongoing commitment to deepening people-to-people ties is marked by 7000 programs at 83 American Spaces in ASEAN countries, the Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative’s&nbsp;155,000 alumni, and the connections forged through nearly 6 million U.S. visas, including student visas, granted to Southeast Asian travelers since 2010.<br><br>At the annual U.S.-ASEAN Summit in October 2021, President Biden announced an unprecedented investment of up to $102 million in U.S.-ASEAN relations, significantly expanding our cooperation on health, climate, science and innovation, trade facilitation, education, and more. Today, the&nbsp;United States and ASEAN will inaugurate a new era of partnership, guided by the complementary objectives of the Indo-Pacific Strategy of the United States and the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific. In that spirit,&nbsp;President Biden is announcing over $150 million in initiatives which we expect will mobilize billions more in private financing that will deepen U.S.-ASEAN relations, strengthen ASEAN centrality, and expand our common capacity to achieve our shared objectives.<br><br><strong>ACCELERATING CLIMATE ACTION, SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT, AND INCLUSIVE PROSPERITY</strong><br><br>In support of U.S.-ASEAN Climate Futures and U.S.-ASEAN Economic Futures, the United States and ASEAN will raise our collective climate ambition while working together to support implementation of the Master Plan on ASEAN Connectivity 2025.&nbsp;&nbsp;We will help meet the region’s enormous infrastructure needs in a sustainable manner that accelerates the clean energy transition, helps the region to achieve a path to net zero emissions by mid-century, and drives inclusive, broad-based prosperity.</p>



<ul><li>Investing in Clean Energy Infrastructure: Through the Southeast Asia Smart Power Program, the United States will invest $40 million in order to mobilize $2 billion in blended financing for clean energy infrastructure in Southeast Asia, thereby decarbonizing and strengthening the region’s power system, increasing regional energy trade, and accelerating the deployment of clean energy technologies.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>U.S.-ASEAN Forest Future Initiative: The United States is committed to working with ASEAN to fight deforestation and accelerate the regional transition to sustainable, climate-positive forest economies – a critical step in achieving ASEAN countries’ climate and development goals.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<ul><li>Mobilizing Finance at Scale: The United States is launching a new platform, bringing together members of the Forest Investor Club, leaders from the United States and ASEAN in the financial sector, conservation and community engagement organizations, agriculture and forestry companies, and governments, to deliver a coordinated approach for natural capital finance. This initiative, subject to appropriate procedures and requirements, aims to mobilize $1 billion in capital investment across the region toward sustainable forestry, forest restoration, and responsible land use.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li><li>ASEAN Nature Finance Innovation Roundtable: The U.S. Agency for International Development, the Department of State, and the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation will convene an ASEAN Nature Finance Innovation Roundtable to catalyze the use of innovative financial mechanisms and mobilize additional&nbsp;finance to support the long-term conservation, restoration, and sustainable management of critical ecosystems in Southeast Asia.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>&nbsp;U.S.-ASEAN Climate Solutions Hub: The United States is launching a U.S.-ASEAN Climate Solutions Hub, which will provide technical assistance to ASEAN countries in order to accelerate implementation of their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and related low-emission development and resilience strategies. This demand-driven initiative will support renewable energy deployment, decarbonization of the transportation sector, methane reduction efforts, and sustainable agriculture, forestry, and land management. It will also support the development of energy and land-use frameworks and measures that mobilize public and private finance and achieve just transitions.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>The&nbsp;U.S.-ASEAN Transportation Dialogue Partnership: The Department of Transportation will launch new air, land, and maritime transportation programs that promote safety, sustainable and resilient infrastructure, regional connectivity, and emerging transport technologies.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>The&nbsp;U.S.-ASEAN Alliance for Protected Area Conservation<strong>:&nbsp;</strong>The Department of the Interior, including the National Park Service, will collaborate with their counterparts in Southeast Asia to expand conservation and reverse deforestation. U.S. rangers will travel to Southeast Asia to share best practices and improve protected area management across the region, emphasizing nature-based climate solutions, sustainable tourism and visitor management, traditional knowledge and access to resources, and transboundary habitat connectivity.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Promoting Investment in Climate-Smart Infrastructure: The U.S. Trade and Development Agency is launching new initiatives intended to catalyze over $13&nbsp;billion in financing for clean energy projects that advance ASEAN’s net zero goals, while leveraging over $1 billion in public and private financing for investment in digital infrastructure and smart cities in Southeast Asia.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Space Cooperation: The United States will invest in the SERVIR initiative to share&nbsp;satellite data&nbsp;across ASEAN in support of climate monitoring and environmental forecasting, disaster management, and food security analysis.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Reducing Methane Emissions:&nbsp;The United States is committed to working with the nations of Southeast Asia to reduce the region’s methane emissions. The United States welcomed Indonesia, Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Singapore joining the Global Methane Pledge at COP-26, and we are accelerating technical assistance, financial resources, and project pipeline development for methane mitigation in Global Methane Pledge countries, including through the EPA, USTDA, DFC, and EXIM, as well as the newly-created&nbsp;Global Methane Hub, a&nbsp;​philanthropic fund that can support methane mitigation priorities in the region.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Trade Winds Business Forum: The Department of Commerce will hold its 2023 flagship trade mission – Trade Winds Business Forum – in Southeast Asia. U.S. companies from a wide range of industries will have the opportunity to pursue new commercial and trade opportunities in the region, building on the 2022 U.S. trade missions to Southeast Asia focused on clean energy, healthcare, and advanced manufacturing.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Accelerating Digital Development:&nbsp;The United States will advance digital development across Southeast Asia through a new $6 million regional initiative that will, in line with the ASEAN Digital Integration Framework Action Plan, support innovation, strengthen digital economy rule-making, facilitate public-private connections, strengthen digital policymaking, and support the adoption of global standards in artificial intelligence.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p><strong>SUPPORTING ACCESS TO EDUCATION&nbsp;</strong><br><br>The strength of U.S.-ASEAN relations is anchored in the friendship shared by our combined one billion people. Each year the United States provides more than $70 million to support educational and cultural exchanges that foster greater understanding, enhance cooperation, and create lifelong friendships that increase the strength and resilience of our communities over the long term.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>U.S.-ASEAN Institute for Rising Leaders at the School of Advanced International Studies: The Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) will launch the U.S.-ASEAN Institute for Rising Leaders, an innovative program to bring exceptional public servants from ASEAN governments to the United States for professional and leadership training. Through private funding, including from Boeing, UPS, PhRMA, and JPMorgan Chase and Co., the program will sponsor up to 30 mid-career public-service professionals each year – up to three from each of the ten ASEAN countries – to attend a tailored, intensive multi-week leadership-development program. The Institute will hone the academic, leadership, and policy-making skills of emerging Southeast Asian leaders and lay a robust foundation for deepening the U.S.-ASEAN partnership – between governments, businesses, and individuals – for years to come.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Expanding Youth Engagement: The Department of State will double the size of the Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative (YSEALI) program within three years, such that 900 emerging leaders will benefit from YSEALI’s academic and professional opportunities every year.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Cooperation in Higher Education: The U.S. government, alongside American companies and universities, is committed to increasing connectivity among educational institutions in the United States and Southeast Asia, while providing new opportunities for students and workers in ASEAN countries to study in the United States or develop critical skills at home.<br>&nbsp;<ul><li>Billion Futures Scholarships: A new cohort of Billion Futures Scholars will begin their studies in U.S. universities across the United States in Fall 2022, joining the 100 Scholars currently in the United States for undergraduate and graduate study, adding $5 million in new funding to our Billion Futures commitment.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li><li>U.S.-ASEAN University Connections: The Department of State will launch a new exchange program through which 20 academic fellows from universities across ASEAN will travel to the United States, exchange best practices with U.S. academics, and explore opportunities for collaborative research and teaching initiatives.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Fulbright ASEAN Scholars: The Department of State will double the size of the Fulbright U.S.-ASEAN Visiting Scholarship Program, such that a wider range of ASEAN academics, government officials, and civil society leaders can travel to the United States to undertake research on topics of importance to the U.S.-ASEAN relationship.<br>&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>English Language Training: The Department of State will significantly&nbsp;expand English language programs in Southeast Asia with a new $3 million investment that will provide capacity-building support for hundreds of thousands of English teachers in the region.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Private Sector Initiatives: Leading American companies have announced new initiatives to increase opportunities for education, training, and upskilling in Southeast Asia. Google will equip 200,000 small and medium enterprises in Southeast Asia with the skills to grow their business, through a $4 million grant to The Asia Foundation’s “Go Digital ASEAN,” and the U.S. Department of State and Google will partner to build digital literacy among youth at American Spaces located in Southeast Asia.&nbsp;HP is providing more than 20,000 students in Indonesia with technology and entrepreneurship skills through five HP Tech Hubs, while 3M is supporting science, technology, engineering, and math education for girls across Southeast Asia. The U.S. ASEAN Business Council Institute has launched a Myanmar Scholarship Fund to support students in the United States whose higher education journeys were disrupted by the crisis in Myanmar.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p><strong>EXPANDING MARITIME COOPERATION</strong><br><br>The United States is committed to supporting implementation of the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific’s Maritime Pillar. Today we are announcing&nbsp;$60 million in new regional maritime initiatives, most of which will be led by the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG).&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Personnel and Presence: The USCG will deploy assets and assign additional personnel to the Indo-Pacific to help meet partners’ requests for maritime training and capacity-building, to include a USCG attaché at the U.S. Mission to ASEAN.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Countering Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated Fishing: The Department of State, Department of Labor, and USCG will launch new initiatives to help ASEAN counties counter illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing and strengthen the capacity of ASEAN sectoral bodies to prevent forced labor in the fishing industry.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Indo-Pacific Support Platform: The USCG will deploy a cutter to Southeast Asia and Oceania for security cooperation and to operate as a training platform. This cutter will deploy throughout the region providing multinational crewing opportunities, conduct training missions, and participate in cooperative maritime engagements.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Excess Defense Articles: As USCG decommissions cutters, the service will prioritize the transfer of ships to Southeast Asian countries to increase the coastal nations’ maritime law enforcement capacity and promote a free and open Pacific.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Southeast Asia Training Team:&nbsp;The Department of State and USCG will expand USCG support to maritime law enforcement agencies in Southeast Asia by placing a training team in the region for the first time with additional dedicated support from U.S.-based trainers.

<p class="has-text-align-center">Via Teleconference</p>



<p>9:40 A.M. EDT</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; And thanks, everyone, for joining.&nbsp; We’re going to do a quick call to preview some of the new initiatives we’re going to be announcing at the U.S.-ASEAN Special Summit.<br><br>This call is on background.&nbsp; It is attributable to a “senior administration official.”&nbsp; And the contents of this call are embargoed until 5:30 p.m. Eastern, U.S. time.<br><br>For your awareness and not for reporting, our speaker on the call today is [senior administration official].&nbsp; He’s going to give some remarks at the top, and then we’re going to take some questions.&nbsp; So, [senior administration official], over to you.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Thank you very, very much, [moderator].&nbsp; And thank you to all who are participating.<br><br>We are very excited here today at the White House, because we’re about to kick off the first day of the U.S.-ASEAN Special Summit.&nbsp; And as you all know, this is the first time it’s been held in Washington, D.C., and at the White House in the history of the 45-year-long partnership.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As I’m sure many of you are aware, at the end of last year, in October, at the U.S.-ASEAN virtual meeting that was held under Brunei’s chairmanship as part of the broader ASEAN Summit, and it also included the East Asia Summit, President Biden announced unprecedented investment of up to $102 million in U.S.-ASEAN relations.&nbsp; It significantly expanded our cooperation on health, climate, science and innovation, trade facilitation, education, and more.&nbsp; We are building on these efforts across the U.S. government at this summit and are very pleased that we’ve been able to work successfully with the different parts of our government as well as with our ASEAN partners.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You will get a lengthy factsheet after this call that highlights the things that we are &#8212; we will be announcing and the deliverables from this, but I think that the key is to put in a broader context that this reflects, I think, a recognition on the part of the administration and &#8212; that we need to step up our game in Southeast Asia and that we need to &#8212; as part of that, we need to work more closely with ASEAN.<br><br>I think that the &#8212; you know, some of the key initiatives that we will be announcing as part of this and that you will see in the factsheet include the following:</p>



<p>First, the United States will invest $40 million that we believe can potentially mobilize up to $2 billion in blended financing for clean energy infrastructure in Southeast Asia that will decarbonize and strengthen the region’s power system, increase regional energy trade, and accelerate the deployment of clean energy technologies, which we see as critical not just to helping address climate change in this fast-growing region, but also is critical to supporting broad-based economic growth in the countries in Southeast Asia that we believe is important for them and also important for us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And we also plan to announce $60 million in new regional maritime initiatives.&nbsp; And this reflects the great importance that maritime issues have in Southeast Asia and for Southeast Asian countries, as well as for the United States.<br><br>As &#8212; elements of this: The U.S. Coast Guard will deploy assets and assign additional personnel to the Indo-Pacific to help meet partners’ requests for maritime training and capacity-building, to include a U.S. Coast Guard attaché who will be assigned to the U.S. Mission to ASEAN.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Department of State, the Department of Labor, and the U.S. Coast Guard will launch new initiatives to help ASEAN counties counter illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing, and strengthen the capacity of ASEAN sectoral bodies to prevent forced labor in the fishing industry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The U.S. Coast Guard will deploy a cutter to Southeast Asia and Oceania for security cooperation and to operate as a training platform.&nbsp; We will also prioritize the transfer of ships &#8212; excess defense articles &#8212; to Southeast Asian countries to increase the coastal nations’ maritime law enforcement capacity and promote a free and open Indo-Pacific, which I’m sure you’ve all seen, or many of you will have seen, is also a key element in our Indo-Pacific strategy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And the Department of State and the U.S. Coast Guard will expand U.S. Coast Guard support to maritime law enforcement agencies in Southeast Asia by placing a training team in the region for the first time with additional dedicated support from U.S.-based trainers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to the clean energy and maritime issues, which we see as extremely important to the region and a very strong area of cooperation between the U.S. and ASEAN as an institution, as well as Southeast Asian nations in bilateral terms, we will also work to support efforts to accelerate digital development in the region, which would &#8212; builds on and benefit from the fact that the population of the United States and ASEAN nations together is a billion people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We will launch a new $6 million regional initiative that will support innovation, strengthen digital economy rulemaking, facilitate public-private connections, strengthen digital policymaking, and support the adoption of global standards in artificial intelligence.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And the U.S. Trade and Development Agency will launch new initiatives intended to catalyze up to, and perhaps even slightly over, $13 billion in financing for clean energy products &#8212; projects that advance ASEAN’s net zero goals while leveraging over $1 billion in public and private financing for investment in digital infrastructure and smart cities in Southeast Asia.</p>



<p>And then, you know, we also see health as a critical area of cooperation.&nbsp; And that was true before the pandemic, but it’s been even more reinforced as a result of our experiences during the pandemic.<br><br>As part of this, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, through its new regional office in Hanoi, Vietnam, will enhance surveillance for pan-respiratory diseases in Southeast Asia.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>This is a $5 million program will increase coverage of large urban population sites and significantly expand access to genomic testing equipment and technology.&nbsp; And then we will also announce that USAID will support up to $10 million in programs to advance early detection and community response for COVID-19, as well as tuberculosis and other airborne diseases across Southeast Asia.</p>



<p>In addition, we recognize that, you know, infrastructure and particularly transportation infrastructure remains a critical need in the region.&nbsp; And, as a result, the Department of Transportation will launch new air, land, and maritime transportation programs that a &#8212; or a series of new land, air, and maritime transportation programs that promote safety, sustainable and resilient infrastructure, regional connectivity, and emerging transport technologies.</p>



<p>In addition, we recognize the continued importance not just of climate issues but, as part of climate issues, environmental protection.&nbsp; And so, as a result, the Department of the Interior, including the National Park Service, will collaborate with their counterparts in Southeast Asia to expand conservation and reverse deforestation.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>And U.S. conversation personnel, including from U.S. &#8212; from the National Park Service will travel to Southeast Asia to share best practices and improve protected area management across the region, emphasizing nature-based climate solutions, as well as sustainable tourism and visitor management, traditional knowledge and access to resources, and transboundary habitat connectivity.</p>



<p>And then, something that we are particularly pleased to be able to announce is that &#8212; recognizing the tremendous importance of the strong people-to-people connections between the United States and countries in Southeast Asia &#8212; the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies &#8212; i.e. SAIS &#8212; will launch the U.S.-ASEAN Institute for Rising Leaders, an innovative program to bring exceptional public servants from ASEAN governments to the United States for professional and leadership training.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Through private funding, including from Boeing and UPS, the program will sponsor up to 30 mid-career public-service professionals each year &#8212; up to 3 from each of the 10 ASEAN countries &#8212; to attend a tailored, intensive multi-week leadership development program.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So as you can see, we have a range of new initiatives across key priority areas that we believe reflect both the traditional partnership between the United States and countries in Southeast Asia and ASEAN itself, as well as new areas that we see as really critical for building out the partnership between the United States and ASEAN, as well as, obviously, strengthening our continued engagements with individual countries in Southeast Asia.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>We’re excited to put this into action.&nbsp; Very excited about the summit, which we do believe marks a major milestone in the development and the strengthening of the U.S.-ASEAN partnership.<br><br>And, with that, I’ll talk a few questions.<br><br>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Could we please give out the directions to ask a question?<br><br></p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Morning, [senior administration official].&nbsp; You said that the U.S. needs to step up its game.&nbsp; Can you expand a little bit on why that’s the case and, you know, how what China has been doing in the region plays into this new push from the Biden administration?</p>



<p>And separately, many ASEAN countries are nervous about being caught between the U.S. and China, particularly publicly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So how did you convince them to agree to some of this new increased security cooperation that you mentioned?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; So, first, let me start off saying it&#8217;s a very good question.&nbsp; I think that I would challenge slightly the premise.&nbsp; We have long been engaged in Southeast Asia.&nbsp; I mean, very clearly, we&#8217;ve been an important player in the region going back to the period immediately after the end of the Second World War.&nbsp; We have longstanding alliances with the Philippines and Thailand.&nbsp; We have strong partnerships with a number of other key countries in the region.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>So this is &#8212; you know, Southeast Asia has been important to the United States for a long time.&nbsp; But there is no question that Southeast Asia’s importance is growing as Southeast Asia itself grows and becomes increasingly more prosperous and more important on the global stage.&nbsp; We have long sought strong relations with the region.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think that what has changed and where we need to step up our game is both working with countries bilaterally, but also working with ASEAN as an institution.&nbsp; As I&#8217;m sure you know, and I&#8217;m sure many others on the call, the &#8212; we’ve had a (inaudible) partnership with ASEAN for 45 years, the truth is it&#8217;s really been in the past, you know, 12, 13 years that we&#8217;ve really stepped up the engagement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I think it&#8217;s a recognition on our part that in order to be effective in Southeast Asia, we need to have a strong partnership and a strong relationship with ASEAN as an institution, as well as with countries bilaterally.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>So I think that, you know, in terms of China, obviously China is an important player in the region.&nbsp; We recognize and we’ve made very clear in our Indo-Pacific strategy, as well as things that we&#8217;ve said bilaterally and in our engagements, that we are not asking countries to make a choice between the United States and China.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We want to make clear, though, that the United States seeks stronger relationships, that we want to expand the areas of cooperation, and that we recognize that in order to do that, we need to be responsive to desires of countries in the region to work in areas that are important to them.&nbsp; So we are working to do that.&nbsp; I think that you&#8217;ve seen in the past year that &#8212; a real effort on the part of the administration to engage Southeast Asia.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, you know, this really started at the beginning of the administration, but COVID restrictions made travel difficult at the beginning.&nbsp; But we&#8217;ve had a steady cadence of senior-level visits &#8212; and going in both directions, in fact &#8212; now culminating with this.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I think that we, more importantly, want to continue building on the very close partnerships that we have with many countries in the region.&nbsp; We want to strengthen where we can.&nbsp; And we see that as part &#8212; we see this as part of that effort.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi.&nbsp; Thank you for taking the question.&nbsp; A number of the investments you&#8217;re announcing today seem to be on topics that are also included in the President&#8217;s Indo-Pacific Economic Framework.&nbsp; And I wondered if you might elaborate on the connection between the investments today in that framework, and whether these are sort of a precursor to some of the initiatives that the administration is looking to undertake as part of those negotiations?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; That&#8217;s a great question.&nbsp; And I think that the &#8212; I think it&#8217;s important to cite this in part of the broader context, which is that we recognize there is a tremendous desire in the region for affirmative U.S. economic engagement.&nbsp; We are very proud of the very strong economic links between the United States and Southeast Asian countries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We are either the leading or one of the most significant investors in many of these countries.&nbsp; There&#8217;s a great deal of trade that goes back and forth.&nbsp; And I think trade with the United States is particularly important in terms of higher value-added products for many of these countries.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the same time, we recognize that we cannot just rest on our laurels.&nbsp; We need to address concerns of &#8212; that matter to countries today and, obviously, advance our own economic interests in the process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, you know, you&#8217;re absolutely right there is some overlap with elements that will be addressed in the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework.&nbsp; But I think that the key is that the &#8212; these are things which reflect the strong shared interests between the United States and countries in the region.&nbsp; And the elements of these areas that will be in the economic framework, when it is formalized, I think reflect our recognition of the fact that to be effective, we need to address things that are of common concern.</p>



<p>In terms of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework itself &#8212; and I know that, you know, someone is going to ask, and I&#8217;ll just say: You know, we’re working with partners in the region on moving forward with the framework.&nbsp; I would stress it is an Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, not an “ASEAN economic framework,” and I think that&#8217;s a significant distinction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We are &#8212; at the same time, we&#8217;re working very closely with partners, including a number of countries in ASEAN, to move forward with this and to help get this off the ground.&nbsp; I think we will have more for you in the not-too-distant future.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the same time, I think that what we&#8217;re looking for in this summit is to really strengthen the areas of collaboration between the United States and ASEAN as an organization.&nbsp; And so, for us, these elements are a critical piece of that, but they are not the only piece of that.&nbsp; And there are many other issues that matter between the United States and ASEAN.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks so much for this.&nbsp; Two quick ones.&nbsp; The first would just be if you have a headline figure for all of the investments that you&#8217;re making here.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But also, just more substantively, I wanted to see if you had a status update on Build Back Better World and if that initiative is going to play into either these announcements or the discussions that you&#8217;re having at ASEAN.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Thank you very much.&nbsp; Both are very good questions.&nbsp; On the headline figure &#8212; and you &#8212; you know, it is rare that we make this kind of a mistake to overlook it &#8212; it is approximately $150 million.&nbsp; And so, we&#8217;re &#8212; you know, we’re very proud of that.&nbsp; We think it reflects the &#8212; you know, the strengthening of the relationship.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I think we want to be very clear we have quite a few bilateral programs &#8212; that are bilateral in nature &#8212; with countries in the region.&nbsp; So, you know, this is not the totality of our assistance to Southeast Asia, but this is what we&#8217;re looking to do with ASEAN as a result of this summit.</p>



<p>In terms of Build Back Better World &#8212; totally understand the question.&nbsp; You know, my sense is that, you know, there &#8212; that is operating on a different track.&nbsp; And there &#8212; you know, there&#8217;s continued efforts on that front.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think that for &#8212; where we stand, we see infrastructure as a very important element of what we&#8217;re doing with ASEAN.&nbsp; You&#8217;ve seen we&#8217;re looking for things that don&#8217;t just &#8212; that, you know, that are not just about providing assistance on specific projects or engagement on specific projects, but that are really seeking to catalyze greater private sector investment, because we believe that to really be effective, we need to harness some of the pools of private capital that are interested but are still sitting on the sidelines.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re looking for ways in which we can prime the pump to do that.</p>



<p>I think that there&#8217;s also a broader recognition of the importance of addressing infrastructure challenges and that this is something that matters to the region and where the United States can bring expertise.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re looking for the best way to harness that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks very much for doing this.&nbsp; Two questions.&nbsp; One specifically on announcements today.&nbsp; Can you expand on the infrastructure piece?&nbsp; I&#8217;m not sure I fully got &#8212; is there investment in infrastructure projects attached to that, or is it, you know, a sort of an advisory thing?&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, secondarily, just a big-picture question: Obviously, the gap between China and the U.S., in terms of overall trade with ASEAN, has gotten relatively wide over the last decade, and there&#8217;s not anything here about expanding market access, trade deals, et cetera.&nbsp; I know that&#8217;s not exactly on the table from the U.S.; it is from China.&nbsp; I guess, how would you respond to the idea that China has more to offer ASEAN economically at the moment than the U.S. does?&nbsp; Thanks.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; I totally understand the question.&nbsp; In term &#8212; let me just go to the first part, which is about the infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, as you may have heard at the top, I said we&#8217;re going to invest $40 million that will go into a blended financing program that we believe could mobilize up to $2 billion that will address clean energy infrastructure in the region.&nbsp; So, you know, that &#8212; so we&#8217;re doing that.</p>



<p>In addition, we have &#8212; we announced that the Department of Transportation will be launching some new programs that will promote safety as well as sustainable and resilient infrastructure and regional connectivity and emerging transport technologies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>And also, the U.S. Trade and Development Agency will announce some initiatives that will &#8212; that we believe could potentially catalyze over $13 billion in financing for clean-energy projects that advance net-zero goals.&nbsp; So, that&#8217;s the reference specifically to the infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In terms of the broader economic relationship, I think it&#8217;s very important to look at a number of things.&nbsp; One is, obviously, the bilateral &#8212; the trade data on goods trade &#8212; very clearly, the relationships with China have grown.&nbsp; I think that it needs to put in the context of, one, geographic proximity and also China&#8217;s growing economy.&nbsp; I mean, naturally, you know, the countries that are closest to China have a significant interest in expanding their trade ties.</p>



<p>I think that in terms of the quality, I would probably take a little bit of exception.&nbsp; I think that the U.S. plays an extremely important role in virtually all of the economies of the countries that will be here.&nbsp; And that role isn&#8217;t just measured in bilateral trade and goods; it&#8217;s measured in services; it&#8217;s also measured in investment.&nbsp; And I think that you can see that in virtually all of these countries, the U.S. remains the largest source of foreign direct investment.&nbsp; And the U.S. foreign direct investment has produced &#8212; it has produced high-quality areas where they&#8217;re able &#8212; the countries in the region are able to participate in much higher value chains.</p>



<p>I think that one of the things that was really driven home by the pandemic and the disruptions on supply chains is that we are extremely &#8212; we&#8217;re extremely closely linked with economies in Southeast Asia.&nbsp; I would just highlight the fact that when chip factories in Malaysia closed, that caused ripple effects that had a real impact on the U.S. auto industry.&nbsp; And I think what that does is it highlights the fact that a lot of the trade between Southeast Asian countries and the United States has a much higher value add for the countries involved.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So we believe that the economic partnership with the United States is still very important.&nbsp; And I think if you look at the relative openness of the markets, the U.S. still does extremely well in comparison to other major trading partners, in terms of the overall openness of our market.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the same time, we recognize that we can&#8217;t simply rest on our laurels.&nbsp; We need to come up with an affirmative economic agenda that makes clear our understanding and our desire to work with countries to address today’s challenges &#8212; some of them, as you know, which are not necessarily covered by traditional trade agreements.&nbsp; And, in that, I would particularly highlight the fact that we&#8217;ve all become far more aware of the importance of supply chains and, in particular, redundancy and resiliency in supply chains.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, I think that there are significant areas where we have the potential to work closely and strengthen the partnerships with Southeast Asian countries.&nbsp; I think Southeast Asian countries are very aware of the economic benefits of closer ties to the United States.&nbsp; And we believe that there is also significant benefits to Americans as well.</p>



<p>One thing that we plan on doing &#8212; and I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve seen &#8212; there will be a CEO event that will be hosted by Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo that the ASEAN leaders will participate in.&nbsp; And I think that that is an indication of the importance that they place on their economic ties with the United States, as well as the fact that we recognize their tremendous benefits to Americans and American firms through stronger connections to an area that is growing significantly and will be increasingly important in global terms in the coming two decades.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you so much.&nbsp; I just want to pick up a couple of questions from my colleagues.&nbsp; And I apologize if this has been discussed earlier; I had some audio problems in the beginning.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just more on the Indones- &#8212; Indo-Pacific Economic Framework.&nbsp; On the logistics of it, is it something that&#8217;s going to be formally announced later on during the President&#8217;s trip to Asia, or is it going to be formally announced during the summit?&nbsp; And can you explain whether some ASEAN countries are interested to sign on; which particular modules are they most interested in?</p>



<p>And just also a follow-up on Build Back Better World.&nbsp; I understand the Daleep Singh has made these listening tours to Africa and the Middle East and Latin America, but I don&#8217;t believe that he&#8217;s been to Southeast Asia on these tours.&nbsp; So, can you explain why and whether there are any plans to do that, and whether there are actually any interest from ASEAN countries for the BW3 program?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Okay, you&#8217;ve asked a bunch of questions, so let me just try and go through those.</p>



<p>I think that in terms of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, again, I don&#8217;t want to get ahead of ourselves.&nbsp; We are working to be able to roll this out at an appropriate time and I don&#8217;t want to point to when that will be.&nbsp; We’re still working on that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, I think that in terms of the interest, we are &#8212; we&#8217;ve been pleasantly surprised at the level of interest from countries in Southeast Asia as well as from other parts of the Indo-Pacific.&nbsp; We believe that this bodes well.&nbsp; At the same time, we don&#8217;t want to get ahead of ourselves, and we still have some work to do as we move forward.</p>



<p>I think that we recognize, though, as I said before, the tremendous importance of an affirmative U.S. economic engagement with the region and that this is something that very much reflects what the region wants.</p>



<p>I think in terms of specific modules &#8212; again, I don&#8217;t want to get ahead of ourselves on that &#8212; I think that we &#8212; as I said, we&#8217;ve been pleasantly surprised by the level of interest from across the region, including from countries in Southeast Asia.&nbsp; And, you know, we&#8217;re looking forward to continuing to work closely with them as we move forward.</p>



<p>In terms of Daleep &#8212; Deputy National Security Advisor Daleep Singh&#8217;s travel, I think that you raise a good point.&nbsp; I would just stress that we have had extensive senior-level engagement with Southeast Asian countries.&nbsp; We have heard very clearly a very strong desire for the U.S. to be more economically engaged.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s obviously part of what&#8217;s gone into the desire to move forward with the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve also heard a great deal of interest in greater U.S. participation in infrastructure efforts.&nbsp; So, you know, while Daleep hasn&#8217;t gone into the region specifically for the purpose of a listening tour, I would note that the Vice President was in the region, the Secretary of Defense has gone to the region, the Secretary of Commerce has gone to the region, the Secretary of State has gone to the region.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve had visitors here, including the Prime Minister of Singapore, who I&#8217;m sure you saw was here at the end of March.&nbsp; The President has engaged with &#8212; virtually with the ASEAN leaders at the ASEAN Summit in October.&nbsp; So we have heard very loudly and clearly the interests from the countries involved.</p>



<p>So, I think that, you know, from our standpoint, we&#8217;re moving forward with this.&nbsp; This is obviously not an easy thing to do, and it&#8217;s very important to coordinate effectively.&nbsp; We want to make sure that we&#8217;re working as partners rather than, you know, dictating sort of a U.S.-only vision for how things should be.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We also are very, very focused on the need to address today&#8217;s challenges and tomorrow&#8217;s, and to look for things &#8212; and look for ways in which we can address the kinds of things that haven&#8217;t always been addressed in traditional trade agreements.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We remain very, very committed to strengthening the U.S. partnership economically, as well as politically and in security terms with the region.&nbsp; We believe that, you know, this is a big part of doing that and there is nothing that substitutes for direct engagement at the leader level.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, we&#8217;re very proud that we&#8217;re able to do this and look forward to a successful summit.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re deeply grateful to our ASEAN partners for the spirit of cooperation that they approach &#8212; they&#8217;ve approached this with.&nbsp; And they&#8217;re &#8212; you know, what we see is their very, very sincere desire for stronger ties with the United States, both with ASEAN as an institution, as well as bilaterally.</p>



<p>So, with that, let me thank you all for joining, and we hope that &#8212; we hope that, you know, we’ll stand ready to answer more questions at some point down the road.&nbsp; You can contact [moderator].&nbsp; But I think we&#8217;re looking forward to a very successful summit.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; Thanks, [senior administration official].</p>



<p>And as a reminder, this call was on background, attributable to a “senior administration official,” and the contents are embargoed until 5:30 p.m. Eastern today.</p>



<p>I know some of you asked for the factsheet; that&#8217;s going to be in your inbox shortly.&nbsp; So thanks, everyone, for joining and talk to you later.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Via Teleconference</p>



<p>3:02 P.M. EDT</p>



<p>MR. MUNOZ:&nbsp; Hi, everybody.&nbsp; Thank you for joining us this afternoon for a call discussing new additional actions President Biden is taking to expand availability of infant formula supply in the United States, especially following his meeting with manufacturers and industry this afternoon.</p>



<p>A reminder this call and the factsheet that you just received are embargoed until the conclusion of the call.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On today&#8217;s call, we have [senior administration official] and [senior administration official].</p>



<p>As a reminder, this call is attributable to senior administration officials.&nbsp; And we’ll have time for questions at the end.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With that, I will kick it to [senior administration official].</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; Thanks, Kevin.&nbsp; And thank you all for joining us today to discuss actions that the President has announced to address the infant formula shortages in the country.</p>



<p>As you are all no doubt aware, on February 17th, the largest infant formula manufacturer in the country, Abbott Nutrition, initiated a voluntary recall of several of their lines of formula.&nbsp; The impacted formula was immediately pulled from the shelves and taken out of warehouse inventory across the country, and production at Abbott&#8217;s manufacturing facility in Sturgis, Michigan, was halted.</p>



<p>This voluntary action came following concerns about bacterial contamination at the facility after four infants became ill and two died in late 2021 and early 2022.</p>



<p>Over the last several months, the federal government has worked to address the production shortfall brought about by the recall.&nbsp; As a result of our ongoing work, more infant formula has been produced in the last four weeks than in the four weeks that preceded the recall, despite the fact that one of the largest infant formula production facilities in the country has been offline during that period.</p>



<p>But we also know that families across the country remain concerned about the availability of infant formula, especially families that rely on specialty products that are harder to substitute and some of which are only produced at the Michigan facility.</p>



<p>So, today, President Biden spoke with retailers and manufacturers, including the CEOs of Walmart, Target, Mead Johnson, and Gerber to talk to them about the work they are doing and call on them to do all they can to help families purchase and access infant formula.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The President discussed with Mead Johnson and Gerber their ongoing efforts to increase production.&nbsp; Their work has made up for the loss of production by Abbott.&nbsp; And the President talked to them about other ways the administration can help on top of the actions that are being announced today.</p>



<p>When the President was speaking to the CEOs of Walmart and Target, he focused on issues specific to retailers and how they are working to stock shelves, including in rural areas and regional disparities they might be seeing.</p>



<p>The President similarly asked what more his team and all of us can do to help move product and get more product to these communities.</p>



<p>Building on that work, the President today also announced several additional steps to get more infant formula onto store shelves as quickly as possible without compromising safety.</p>



<p>Both steps include, first, cutting red tape to get more infant formula to the shelves by urging states to provide flexibility in the WIC program, which can be a key driver of some supply disruptions; second, calling on FTC and state attorneys general to crack down on price gouging and unfair market practices related to the sales of infant formula, like third-party sellers reselling infant formula at steep markups; and third, increasing the supply of infant formula through increased imports.</p>



<p>These are important actions that build on the work the administration has done to date.&nbsp; And we will continue to find other ways to support the safe and rapid increase in production and distribution of infant formula.</p>



<p>So, with that, [senior administration official] and I would be happy to take your questions.</p>



<p>MR. MUNOZ:&nbsp; Thanks, [senior administration official].&nbsp; First question &#8212; we have time for just a couple &#8212; Kaitlan Collins, CNN.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks so much.&nbsp; I&#8217;m wondering what the retailers and manufacturers told the President today about how long they expect this to last.&nbsp; And when do you think &#8212; what is your assessment of when they will restart production at this facility?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Yeah, so I&#8217;m not able to share any additional details about the specific conversations.&nbsp; I will reiterate that they were productive and encouraging conversations about all the work that we can do together to support moms and families during this time.&nbsp; And we do not today have an estimate for when Abbott’s facility will come online.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But as we have said, this administration is working around the clock to do everything we can to bring as much production to market while protecting the safety and wellbeing of families.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; In addition, the manufacturers reassured us that they were going to do all that was necessary to maintain increased production levels at all their facilities to make sure that they are able to meet the needs of the market at this time.</p>



<p>MR. MUNOZ:&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; Let’s go to Jeff Mason at Reuters.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks very much.&nbsp; Can you give us more details on what you mean by increasing imports?&nbsp; The factsheet indicated that there will be an announcement about that in the coming days, if you&#8217;re able to give any more details on that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And do you have a sense of &#8212; the one piece of the factsheet that I found hard to understand was the WIC program that you also referred to.&nbsp; What impact will those changes have?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; I can take those in turn.</p>



<p>On the FDA action, I don&#8217;t have too much more to share.&nbsp; FDA is working now to make an announcement very soon about how we will be able to import more formula from abroad to lessen challenges for families, and we will certainly be in touch as we have additional details to announce there.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the WIC program, let me start, and then [senior administration official] can talk a little bit about how this affects the supply chain as a whole.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But as you all likely know, the WIC program supports the purchase of formula and other nutrition products for families of young children and moms.</p>



<p>There are, in normal times, significant rules about what products families can purchase.&nbsp; And there are also rules about how suppliers that participate in the WIC program have to maintain stock of particular supplies in order to participate in WIC.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so, USDA has been working since February with states to relax those rules and make it easier for families to substitute products and for suppliers and retailers to more flexibly participate in the WIC program.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And USDA will be urging all states to take up that &#8212; to take up those flexibilities and really alleviate burdens across the supply chain that can, again, make it difficult for families and retailers.</p>



<p>[Senior administration official], anything you want to add there?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; On the production side, what that effectively does is: When you decrease the variability and the complexity of products that a manufacturer has to make, they can institute a lot more scale efficiencies in their production process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So if you have states go from saying “We&#8217;ll only let you buy 12 ounces” for your WIC participants, and instead saying “You can buy 32-ounce containers,” then they can run more efficient production lines and only have to produce a lot of 32-ounce containers instead of 12-ounce containers.&nbsp; That just leads to faster production out of plants, quicker delivery of product from factory floor to store shelves.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And it&#8217;s important here that the states take actions that drive kind of standardization in the market like that to decrease the manufacturing complexities.</p>



<p>MR. MUNOZ:&nbsp; Let’s go to Hannah Brandt at Nexstar.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; Thanks for taking my question.&nbsp; There are a lot of lawmakers on both sides calling for the President to invoke the Defense Production Act.&nbsp; Is there any talk about that?&nbsp; Is that a future action he might take if this continues?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; So, I can take that one.&nbsp; You know, as we said at the top, we remain 100 percent focused on this issue.&nbsp; We know it’s urgent.&nbsp; We know it’s important to families and to vulnerable children.&nbsp; So we&#8217;ll continue to explore every option at the &#8212; on the table and look at any lever we can pull to address the situation.</p>



<p>We know that the recall has impacted availability of formula.&nbsp; And as you&#8217;ve heard us talk about today, we have taken measures &#8212; the FDA has taken measures, USDA has taken measures, and the companies have all taken measures here to ramp up production quickly.&nbsp; We feel &#8212; we are reassured that the companies now are back at production levels that are above the production levels that they had been right before the February 17th recall took place.&nbsp; But, again, we&#8217;re going to keep every option on the table and keep exploring things we can do.</p>



<p>MR. MUNOZ:&nbsp; All right, and we have time for a couple more questions.&nbsp; Let’s go to Kevin Robillard at Huffington Post.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, guys.&nbsp; Thanks for taking the questions.&nbsp; Thanks for doing the call.&nbsp; Why did it take so long for this issue to sort of come up the White House&#8217;s radar?&nbsp; This has obviously been building for quite some time, and it really has been, you know, pretty acute since the recall happened.&nbsp; So why wasn&#8217;t &#8212; why weren&#8217;t steps being taken, sort of, more proactively over the past few months to alleviate this problem?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Yeah, so I can assure you that this is not new to the White House&#8217;s radar.&nbsp; We have been working on this issue since the very beginning, in the days leading up to the recall and ever since then.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, you know, since mid-February, we have been working closely with USDA and FDA on a suite of actions that they have taken, which is why we are able to say today that production today is &#8212; you know, exceeds production in the period just before the recall was &#8212; the recall was initiated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As just some examples of the ongoing work we have been doing: We’ve, throughout this period, been cutting red tape to expedite the import of infant formula for other countries.&nbsp; Since February, we have been working with retailers to impose purchase limits, prevent the possibility of hoarding.&nbsp; Again, we have had ongoing work with other &#8212; with all manufacturers of infant formula to bring product to market, and we have really seen that pay off.&nbsp; And, you know, it is helping to mitigate some of the challenges that we might otherwise be facing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the same time, we absolutely recognize the frustration that American families are feeling right now.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s why the President has acted to direct the administration to pull additional levers and take additional action to make more supply available as quickly as possible.&nbsp; He&#8217;s leading with action, not words.&nbsp; And that’s the package of announcements you&#8217;re seeing today.</p>



<p>MR. MUNOZ:&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; Last question.&nbsp; Let’s go to Kathryn Watson at CBS.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi.&nbsp; Thank you so much for doing this call.&nbsp; If production has reached the levels &#8212; reached or surpassed the levels of where it was before this recall, when can parents expect to see that result on the shelves?&nbsp; How many weeks, days, months are we talking about until the &#8212; you know, that supply is actually felt?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; So, we absolutely recognize the frustration of parents and families.&nbsp; I am expecting my second child in June and, you know, feel this issue very, very acutely.&nbsp; So, you know, this is &#8212; we know that the American people need to see product on the shelves consistently and that this is a critical issue.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why we are announcing this package of actions today to speed things up.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t have a particular timeline for you. &nbsp;But we are &#8212; we are working closely with partners across the federal government to mitigate these shortages and improve experiences for American families as they’re shopping for formula across the country.</p>



<p>MR. MUNOZ:&nbsp; Thanks, [senior administration official], and thanks, [senior administration official].&nbsp; Again, thank you everybody for joining this call.&nbsp; When we get off this, both the contents of the call and the factsheet are lifted.&nbsp; And reach out to me with any questions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thank you.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>3:17 P.M. EDT</p>
