										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50&nbsp;U.S.C. 1701 <em>et seq.</em>) (IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act&nbsp;(50 U.S.C. 1601 <em>et seq</em>.) (NEA), section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (8 U.S.C. 1182(f)), and&nbsp;section 301 of title 3, United States Code,</p>



<p>I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of&nbsp;America, hereby expand the scope of the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13219 of June 26, 2001 (Blocking Property of Persons Who Threaten International Stabilization Efforts in the Western Balkans), as amended by Executive Order 13304 of May 28, 2003 (Termination of Emergencies With Respect to Yugoslavia and Modification of Executive Order 13219 of June&nbsp;26, 2001), finding that the situation in the territory of&nbsp;the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Republic of Albania (the Western Balkans), over the past two decades, including the undermining of post-war agreements and institutions following the breakup of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, as well as widespread corruption within various governments and institutions in the Western Balkans, stymies progress toward effective and democratic governance and full integration into transatlantic institutions, and thereby constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Accordingly, I hereby order:<br><span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">1.</span>  (a)  All property and interests in property that are in the United States, that hereafter come within the United States, or that are or hereafter come within the possession or control of any United States person of the following persons are blocked and may not be transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or otherwise dealt in:  any person determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State:<br>          (i)    to be responsible for or complicit in, or to have directly or indirectly engaged in, actions or policies that threaten the peace, security, stability, or territorial integrity of any area or state in the Western Balkans;<br>          (ii)   to be responsible for or complicit in, or to have directly or indirectly engaged in, actions or policies that undermine democratic processes or institutions in the Western Balkans;<br>          (iii)  to be responsible for or complicit in, or to have directly or indirectly engaged in, a violation of, or an act that has obstructed or threatened the implementation of, any regional security, peace, cooperation, or mutual recognition agreement or framework or accountability mechanism related to the Western Balkans, including the Prespa Agreement of 2018; the Ohrid Framework Agreement of 2001; United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244; the Dayton Accords; or the Conclusions of the Peace Implementation Conference Council held in London in December 1995, including the decisions or conclusions of the High Representative, the Peace Implementation Council, or its Steering Board; or the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, or, with respect to the former Yugoslavia, the International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals;<br>          (iv)   to be responsible for or complicit in, or to have directly or indirectly engaged in, serious human rights abuse in the Western Balkans;<br>          (v)    to be responsible for or complicit in, or to have directly or indirectly engaged in, corruption related to the Western Balkans, including corruption by, on behalf of, or otherwise related to a government in the Western Balkans, or a current or former government official at any level of government in the Western Balkans, such as the misappropriation of public assets, expropriation of private assets for personal gain or political purposes, or bribery;<br>          (vi)   to have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of, any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order; or <br>          (vii)  to be owned or controlled by, or to have acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order.<br>     (b)  The prohibitions in subsection (a) of this section apply except to the extent provided by statutes, or in regulations, orders, directives, or licenses that may be issued pursuant to this order, and notwithstanding any contract entered into or any license or permit granted before the date of this order. </p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec.</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">2.</span>  The prohibitions in section 1 of this order include:<br>     (a)  the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order; and<br>     (b)  the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec.</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">3.</span>  I hereby determine that the making of donations of the types of articles specified in section 203(b)(2) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)(2)) by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to section 1(a) of this order would seriously impair my ability to deal with the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13219, as amended by Executive Order 13304, and as expanded in this order, and I hereby prohibit such donations as provided by section 1 of this order.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec.</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">4.</span>  (a)  The unrestricted immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the United States of noncitizens determined to meet one or more of the criteria in section l(a) of this order would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and the entry of such persons into the United States, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, is hereby suspended, except when the Secretary of State or the Secretary of Homeland Security, as appropriate, determines that the person&#8217;s entry would not be contrary to the interests of the United States, including when the Secretary of State or Secretary of Homeland Security, as appropriate, so determines, based on a recommendation of the Attorney General, that the person&#8217;s entry would further important United States law enforcement objectives. <br>     (b)  The Secretary of State shall implement this order as it applies to visas pursuant to such procedures as the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, may establish. <br>     (c)  The Secretary of Homeland Security shall implement this order as it applies to the entry of noncitizens pursuant to such procedures as the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State, may establish.<br>     (d)  Such persons shall be treated by this section in the same manner as persons covered by section 1 of Proclamation 8693 of July 24, 2011 (Suspension of Entry of Aliens Subject to United Nations Security Council Travel Bans and International Emergency Economic Powers Act Sanctions).</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec.</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">5.</span>  (a)  Any transaction that evades or avoids, has the purpose of evading or avoiding, causes a violation of, or attempts to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited.<br>     (b)  Any conspiracy formed to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec.</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">6.</span>  For the purposes of this order:<br>     (a)  the term &#8220;entity&#8221; means a partnership, association, trust, joint venture, corporation, group, subgroup, or other organization;<br>     (b)  the term &#8220;noncitizen&#8221; means any person who is not a citizen or noncitizen national of the United States;<br>     (c)  the term &#8220;person&#8221; means an individual or entity; and<br>     (d)  the term &#8220;United States person&#8221; means any United States citizen, lawful permanent resident, entity organized under the laws of the United States or any jurisdiction within the United States (including foreign branches), or any person in the United States.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec.</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">7.</span>  For those persons whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order who might have a constitutional presence in the United States, I find that because of the ability to transfer funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of measures to be taken pursuant to this order would render those measures ineffectual.  I therefore determine that for these measures to be effective in addressing the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13219, as amended by Executive Order 13304, and as expanded by this order, there need be no prior notice of a listing or determination made pursuant to this order.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec.</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">8.</span>  The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to take such actions, including the promulgation of rules and regulations, and to employ all powers granted to the President by IEEPA as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this order.  The Secretary of the Treasury may, consistent with applicable law, redelegate any of these functions within the Department of the Treasury.  All executive departments and agencies of the United States shall take all appropriate measures within their authority to implement this order.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec.</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">9.</span>  Nothing in this order shall prohibit transactions for the conduct of the official business of the Federal Government by employees, grantees, or contractors thereof.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec.</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">10.</span>  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:<br>          (i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or<br>          (ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.<br>     (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.<br>     (c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.                       </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>On June 26, 2001, by Executive Order 13219, the President declared a national emergency with respect to the Western Balkans pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 <em>et seq</em>.) to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy&nbsp;of the United States constituted by the actions of persons engaged in, or assisting, sponsoring, or supporting, (i)&nbsp;extremist violence in the former Republic of Macedonia (what&nbsp;is now the Republic of North Macedonia) and elsewhere in&nbsp;the Western Balkans region, or (ii) acts obstructing implementation of the Dayton Accords in Bosnia or United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 of June 10, 1999, in Kosovo.&nbsp; The President subsequently amended that order in Executive Order&nbsp;13304 of May 28, 2003, to take additional steps with respect to certain actions that obstruct implementation of, among other things, the Ohrid Framework Agreement of 2001 relating to Macedonia.</p>



<p>The actions of persons threatening the peace and international stabilization efforts in the Western Balkans, including acts of extremist violence and obstructionist activity, continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat&nbsp;to the national security and foreign policy of the United&nbsp;States.&nbsp; For this reason, the national emergency declared on June 26, 2001, must continue in effect beyond June&nbsp;26, 2021.&nbsp; Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1&nbsp;year the national emergency declared with respect to the Western Balkans in Executive Order 13219.</p>



<p>This notice shall be published in the <em>Federal&nbsp;Register </em>and&nbsp;transmitted to the Congress.</p>

<p>Following a bilateral meeting with Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador on June 8, 2021 and in light of the United States and Mexico’s deep cultural, social, and economic ties and the two governments’ shared commitment to a prosperous and secure North America, Vice President Harris announces the following:<br><br><strong>High-Level Economic Dialogue:</strong> The United States and Mexico agreed to hold a High-Level Economic Dialogue in September, fulfilling President Biden’s and President López Obrador’s commitment on March 1 to revive this key forum that will expand bilateral economic cooperation and collaboration. The proposed agenda will cover key themes, such as trade facilitation, telecommunications and interconnectivity, and supply chain resiliency.<br><br><strong>Cabinet-Level Security Dialogue</strong>: The United States and Mexico agreed to hold a cabinet-level security dialogue to discuss a shared vision for security. Transnational criminal organizations do not recognize borders.  They pose a threat to all peoples and require a joint response. The United States and Mexico are committed to working together to reduce homicides and drug-related deaths on both sides of the border and counter the illicit forces that drive them.<br><br><strong>Strengthen Labor Cooperation</strong>: The United States will invest an additional $130 million in technical assistance and cooperation over the next three years to work with Mexico as it implements labor legislation and to fund programs that will support workers, improve working conditions, and address child and forced labor. President Lopez Obrador signed historic labor reform legislation into law on May 1, 2019.<br><br><strong>Work Together To Address Root Causes of Migration in Central America</strong>: The governments of the United States and Mexico signed a memorandum of understanding to establish a strategic partnership to address the lack of economic opportunities in northern Central America. The two governments will work together to foster agricultural development and youth empowerment programs in El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala and will co-create and co-manage a partnership program enabling them to better deliver, measure, and communicate about assistance to the region.<br><br><strong>Operations Group on Human Smuggling and Human Trafficking</strong>: U.S. and Mexican law enforcement agencies will partner to exchange information and take appropriate actions to address the shared priority of disabling human trafficking and human smuggling organizations.  These groups prey on vulnerable individuals, falsely promising them safe passage or a good job in the United States in exchange for their savings.  In fact, these organizations often use lies and threats to lure migrants into being trafficked or leave them stranded in Mexico or at the border, far from help and without basic supplies. Law enforcement agencies will work jointly to identify targets, develop investigations, and take enforcement actions such as freezing bank accounts associated with criminal groups. <br><br><strong>Attract Investment to Southern Mexico</strong>: The U.S. government has developed a package of grants, loans, and other commitments that will help generate broad-based growth in southern Mexico, create jobs and reduce economic inequality in the region.  The U.S. government will aim to create $250 million in new investment and sales in southern Mexico by strengthening rural value chains such as cacao, coffee, and eco-tourism. The U.S. International Development Finance Cooperation will issue a loan to support affordable housing and mortgages; 40 to 50 percent of new homes will be built in southern Mexico. The U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) and the Department of Commerce will organize trade and business development missions that will support infrastructure development in southern Mexico. USTDA plans to provide a grant to Mexico’s aviation regulator for technical assistance to improve efficiencies.<br><br><strong>Partnership to Resolve Disappearances Cases in Mexico: </strong>The United States and Mexico will work to expand forensic capacity and partnerships to help solve the more than 82,000 cases of missing persons and disappearances in Mexico, potentially bringing closure to tens of thousands of families and ending impunity for offenders. The Department of State, U.S. Agency for International Development, and the Department of Justice will continue to train lab technicians and police to enhance their skills in forensic analysis of decomposed bodies and support Mexico’s National Search Commission to collect, maintain, and analyze missing persons registries across the country. As a next step, the Federal Bureau of Investigation will train genetics experts on a new system to track forensic information and improve capacity.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Via Teleconference </p>



<p>10:19 A.M. EDT</p>



<p>ACTING ADMINISTRATOR SLAVITT:&nbsp; Good morning.&nbsp; Welcome to our White House COVID Response press briefing.&nbsp; Today, I am joined by Dr. Walensky, Dr. Fauci, and Dr. Nunez-Smith.&nbsp; I want to first provide an update on our vaccination program.<br><br>Over the weekend, Washington State became the 13th state to reach the milestone of 70 percent of adults with at least one shot. &nbsp;I spoke with Governor Inslee, who conveyed that despite their great progress, the continued work needed to move the state back to normal. &nbsp;He, after all, governs the state where most of us witnessed the first major coronavirus outbreak last year. &nbsp;And I conveyed our complete support for the steps he is taking with regard to how he is managing the public health actions to bring the state back in as safe a way as possible.<br><br>Now, every state has the ability to do what has been done in these 13 states, but there is no doubt that it takes work.&nbsp; That’s why last week we launched the National Month of Action to help more states reach that milestone and get more people vaccinated.<br><br>Over the weekend, volunteers across 45 states completed more than 500,000 phone calls, door knocks, or texts.&nbsp; The First Lady and Dr. Fauci visited a vaccination clinic in New York City, where they met Annette, a 92-year-old woman who was there because her grandson convinced her and drove her to get the shot.<br><br>If you don’t have someone in your life to do that, don’t worry, you can text your ZIP Code to 438829 and get a free ride to and from a vaccination site.&nbsp; Uber and Lyft have already completed more than 150,000 free rides to help Americans get vaccinated, and this program will continue until July 4.<br><br>And Dr. Nunez-Smith will have a further update on making transportation even more broadly available.<br><br>Now, according to our surveys, many employees say they would get a vaccine if they were able to do so around their working hours.&nbsp; So, we are very pleased that effective immediately, the American Hospital Association has launched the capability to bring vaccinations directly to people’s workplaces through their member hospitals.<br><br>Employers can now email COVID19@aha.org, and your business will be connected with a local provider who can work with you to host an onsite pop-up clinic, and usually make it happen in a matter of days.<br><br>Many states and many businesses have launched incentive programs.&nbsp; And anecdotal reports are emerging that many of these are working well.<br><br>Look at Jonathan Carlyle, an Amazon delivery driver from Toledo, Ohio.&nbsp; Here’s what he said about getting vaccinated, and I quote: “I kept hemming and hawing about it, and I work all the time.”&nbsp; When Vax-a-Million &#8212; “when this Vax-a-Million thing started, I immediately went down there and got it.&nbsp; It pushed me over the edge.”<br><br>Today, Jonathan Carlyle is on his way to being fully vaccinated.&nbsp; And he’s a millionaire because he also won Ohio’s Vax-a-Million.&nbsp; Safe from COVID and a millionaire.&nbsp; And, Jonathan, it doesn’t stop there: You’re also eligible for a free beer from Anheuser-Busch on July 4.&nbsp; What a great country.<br><br>And that’s before even considering that Dr. Fauci and his team at the National Institutes of Allergies and Infectious Diseases helped invent and invest in the mRNA platform over the last two decades so that we would be ready in case the worst should happen.&nbsp; Jonathan, that’s how you got your vaccine in the first place.&nbsp; So, thank you, Dr. Fauci.<br><br>Finally, many Americans say they will get vaccinated if one thing happens: They have a chance to talk to their physician and get their questions answered.&nbsp; So, call your physician if you want to know if you should get vaccinated.&nbsp; And if you don’t have one, call a local hospital or clinic.<br><br>Rather than wait for the call, the people at a company called Centene, an insurer that disproportionately serves lower-income Americans, is initiating something highly innovative that I hope people follow, and so do they.<br><br>They will launch a campaign to conduct vaccination education and outreach to 25 million Americans.&nbsp; More than half of them will get a call directly on their phone.<br><br>And when Centene reaches someone who is unvaccinated, they will connect them to their physician directly and help them arrange an appointment.&nbsp; And Kaiser Permanente is conducting a similar approach through email, texting, and direct mail.<br><br>We do hope other organizations, with broad reach directly into patient populations like this, follow their lead and contact people who are at-risk, because they don’t have a vaccination and talk to them about the benefits of vaccination.<br><br>These are all great examples about how this is not an effort to 70 percent that is being done by the government; it is being led by the American people and by constituents all around the country.<br><br>Since today is my last briefing, and tomorrow is my last day in the White House, I want to close by saying what a pleasure it has been not only to serve on the President’s COVID response team, but also to be able to help lead these briefings.<br><br>We’ve aimed to follow the example of the President by presenting clear, straight answers to the best of our ability and a view of what we are seeing, whether the news is good or bad.&nbsp;<br><br>It has been an honor to serve as part of an administration committed to working day and night until Americans are able to feel safe again from this pandemic, that the pandemic becomes highly manageable, that the economy is flourishing, and that we are on our way towards vaccinating the globe.<br><br>But I’m even prouder to serve in an administration that has been so deeply committed to seeing our values in action every day, pulling everyone together and leaving no one out, empathetic to what ordinary Americans are going through, and leading with equity at every turn.<br><br>Even as so much of what we cherish is returning, we cannot let our progress be a reason for taking our foot off the pedal.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Threats remain.&nbsp; We must push harder so more Americans can return to normal life and the peace of mind that comes with being vaccinated.<br><br>And with that, I’ll turn it over to Dr. Walensky.<br><br>DR. WALENSKY: &nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Andy.&nbsp; Please know you will be dearly missed in this venue and across.<br><br>Good morning to everyone.&nbsp; I&#8217;m pleased to be back with you today.&nbsp;<br><br>As far as the data: Yesterday, CDC reported just over 10,000 new cases of COVID-19.&nbsp; Our seven-day average is 13,277 cases per day, and this represents yet another decrease of nearly 30 percent from the prior seven-day average, but most importantly, a 94 percent decrease from COVID-19 cases since January of this year, and the first time that the seven-day average of cases has been less than 15,000 since March 27, 2020.&nbsp;<br><br>In other good news, the seven-day average of new hospital admissions is just a bit over 2,200.&nbsp; That is a decrease of 83 percent in hospitalizations since January 9th of this year when we peaked at over 16,500 average daily admissions.&nbsp;<br><br>And finally, the seven-day average of daily deaths remains at 379 per day.&nbsp; It gives me so much hope to report these declines in cases, hospitalizations, and deaths.&nbsp; It is, in part, a result of our ongoing efforts to vaccinate so many Americans.&nbsp;<br><br>Each week, there are more and more data to demonstrate the impact a vaccination has on preventing disease and moving us out of this pandemic.&nbsp;<br><br>Today, CDC published an MMWR that demonstrates how high vaccination coverage in older adults in the United States has likely served to reduce COVID-19 cases and severe outcomes.<br><br>In this new CDC study, we looked at the rates of cases, emergency department visits, hospital admissions, and deaths across all age group both before and after the COVID-19 vaccine was available, from December 2020 to May 2021.</p>



<p>We observed larger declines in COVID-19 cases, emergency department visits, hospitalizations and deaths in adults over age 65 &#8212; who were prioritized for vaccination in the early phases &#8212; than in adults aged 18 to 49, who are less likely to be vaccinated.</p>



<p>By comparing data from November and December of 2020, before vaccine rollout, with data from April and May, after vaccine rollout, and by stratifying the data by age groups, we are able to see the critical contribution of vaccination coverage on reducing COVID-19 cases, severe illness, and death, especially among those over 65 years.</p>



<p>As of today, we have administered over 300 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine.&nbsp; More than 85 percent of adults over age 65 have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, and 75 percent are fully vaccinated and fully protected.<br><br>Still, we have a lot more work to do, especially in younger age groups.&nbsp; Of Americans that qualify for a vaccine &#8212; those that are 12 years of age and over &#8212; we have been able to vaccinate 50 percent of the country.&nbsp; This is great news, but there is more work to be done.</p>



<p>During this pivotal month of action, if you are not vaccinated, please go to Vaccines.gov, text your ZIP code to GETVAX, or 438829, or talk with your healthcare provider, state or local health department, or local pharmacist to find out more about getting vaccinated.</p>



<p>And if you’ve gotten your first dose of Pfizer or Moderna, don’t forget to get your second either three or four weeks later.<br><br>I’ll stop here and turn it over to Dr. Fauci.<br><br>DR. FAUCI: &nbsp;Thank you very much, Dr. Walensky. &nbsp;<br><br>Before I start, let me just underscore what Dr. Walensky said about how much we will miss Andy Slavitt.&nbsp; Andy, you are a class act, and we will miss you greatly.&nbsp;<br><br>What I’m going to do right now is spend the next couple of minutes talking to you about a subject that has gained a lot more attention over the last few days, and that has to do with the variants in general, but particularly in the variant which we now refer to as Delta, or the B1617.2., which, in fact, as you know, originally was noticed in India and dominated in certain states in India, but now has spread throughout other elements and other areas of the world.&nbsp;<br><br>Next slide.&nbsp;<br><br>So let&#8217;s just take a quick look at that.&nbsp; It&#8217;s reported in 60 countries, including the UK and the USA.&nbsp; Clearly, now its transmissibility appears to be greater than the wild type, named the Alpha variant.&nbsp; It may be associated with an increased disease severity, such as hospitalization risk, compared to Alpha.&nbsp; And in lab tests, associated with modest decreased neutralization by sera from previously infected and vaccinated individuals compared to the Alpha.&nbsp;<br><br>However, fortunately, two doses of the Pfizer vaccine and AstraZeneca appear to be effective against the Delta variant.&nbsp; There&#8217;s reduced vaccine effectiveness after one dose, however &#8212; and I&#8217;ll get back to that in a moment.&nbsp;<br><br>Next slide.&nbsp;<br><br>This is a publication, from what I had mentioned to you at a previous briefing, from Public Health England, and it has to do with the effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccines against this delta variant.&nbsp; Just to reiterate: Two weeks after the second dose of the mRNA Pfizer-BioNTech, it was 88 percent effective against the 617, and just like we&#8217;ve shown multiple times, over 93 percent effective against the B117.<br><br>Take a look at the last bullet.&nbsp; Three weeks after one dose, both vaccines &#8212; the AZ and the Pfizer-BioNTech &#8212; were only 33 percent effective against symptomatic disease from delta.&nbsp; Clearly important about why a second dose is so important.&nbsp;<br><br>Next slide.&nbsp;<br><br>Now, what about what&#8217;s going on in the UK and why should we learn lessons from this, and always getting back to the situation of why it&#8217;s so important to be vaccinated?<br><br>In the UK, the delta variant is the rapidly emerging as the dominant variant &#8212; greater than 60 percent.&nbsp; It is replacing the B117.&nbsp; The peak transmission in my conversations with, and the data associated with the UK, when talking to their health authorities, the transmission is peaking in the younger group of 12- to 20-year-olds &#8212; mainly that group that we&#8217;re concerned about here, about making sure they get vaccinated.<br><br>And as I mentioned before, there&#8217;s poor protection after a single dose of either the mRNA or AZ vaccine.&nbsp;<br><br>Next slide.&nbsp;<br><br>This slide graphically demonstrates in the darker part of the slide, the red, the emergence of the B1617.2 compared to the lighter pink, which was the original B117.&nbsp; It&#8217;s essentially taking over.<br><br>Last slide.&nbsp;<br><br>So let&#8217;s look at where we are in the United States.&nbsp; That variant, the delta variant, currently accounts for more than 6p percent of the sequence cases in the United States.&nbsp; This is a situation, the way it was in England, where they had a B117 dominant, and then the 617 took over.&nbsp;<br><br>We cannot let that happen in the United States, which is such a powerful argument to underscore with Dr. Walensky said.&nbsp; To get vaccinated, particularly if you’ve had your first dose, make sure you get that second dose.&nbsp; And for those who have been not vaccinated yet, please get vaccinated.&nbsp; This is the national month of action.&nbsp; We want to get to and above the goal of 70 percent of the adult population receiving at least one dose by the fourth of July.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll stop there, and over to you, Dr. Nunez-Smith.<br><br>DR. NUNEZ-SMITH.&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; Thank you so much, Dr. Fauci.&nbsp; And good morning to everyone.&nbsp;<br><br>As we know, for our national vaccination campaign to be successful, everyone &#8212; everyone in our country needs to benefit from the scientific discovery with the vaccines.&nbsp; We absolutely cannot beat this virus without making sure there&#8217;s a plan that works for everyone and works for all communities.&nbsp;<br><br>So, to ensure that we are truly reaching everyone who is unvaccinated in this phase of our vaccination program, in this month of action, we are working hard and continuing to make progress in addressing the structural barriers that many people face in terms of access.&nbsp; We&#8217;re focusing even harder on meeting people exactly where they are.&nbsp; And we will continue to provide the public with the answers that you need about getting vaccinated.&nbsp;<br><br>It is our pledge to make sure that vaccination is easy and convenient for everyone.&nbsp; So we&#8217;ve increased the number of pop-up and mobile units across the country.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve ensured that the majority of our 40,000 participating pharmacies are located in areas that are at higher risk. &nbsp;<br><br>We understand not everyone can operate on a nine to five schedule, as Andy said.&nbsp; So, pharmacies are now accepting walk in appointments and have extended their hours.&nbsp;<br><br>Starting this week, thousands of pharmacies nationwide will stay open late every Friday in June, and will offer the services throughout the night to make sure individuals can get their shot.&nbsp;<br><br>We already see the difference our pharmacy program is making to close the equity gap.&nbsp; Over the last two weeks, half of pharmacy doses have been administered to people of color.&nbsp; And our community health center program remains another trustworthy, available option for neighborhoods across the country.&nbsp; They are also closing the equity gap.&nbsp; About 70 percent of shots through the federal community health center program have been administered to people of color.&nbsp;<br><br>Still, when talking to those who are unvaccinated, I often hear many of the same reasons for why they have yet to get a shot.&nbsp; Many, many people have concerns about missing a day of work, about paying for childcare, or about how they will travel to and from a vaccination site.&nbsp;<br><br>For individuals and communities facing greater degrees of socio economic disadvantage &#8212; those who can&#8217;t afford to miss a day or two of work; that can&#8217;t afford unplanned, unexpected childcare or travel expenses &#8212; risking a shockwave through a family&#8217;s finances is just not tenable.&nbsp; So, the COVID-19 response team has focused on addressing each of these barriers: paid time off, childcare, and transportation.&nbsp;<br><br>First, last month, the President announced a tax credit to fully reimburse employers &#8212; those with fewer than 500 employees &#8212; that provide paid time off for vaccination and any side effects. &nbsp;And he called on every employer in the country to do the same.<br><br>And second, last week, the President announced that through July 4th, the nation&#8217;s largest childcare providers will offer free childcare to parents and caregivers getting vaccinated and anybody recuperating from vaccination.<br><br>The Department of Health and Human Services also issued guidance encouraging all states to use funding from the American Rescue Plan to support local and home-based providers who want to join the effort.<br><br>And third, Uber and Lyft providing free rides to vaccination sites through July 4th.&nbsp; And just today, the Department of Transportation announced that more than 350 transit agencies across the country are also offering free rides to vaccination sites.&nbsp;<br><br>We want to give everyone in the country as many free transit options as possible &#8212; by subway, bus, rideshare.&nbsp; There are multiple ways to get to and from your shot for free.&nbsp; And many of these public transit efforts are supported by the American Rescue Plan, which has provided more than $30 billion in support for transit agencies, and several of these transit agencies are in hard-hit and high-risk communities with lower vaccination rates.<br><br>You know, in Florida, the Jacksonville Transportation Authority has partnered with Agape Family Health to launch “<s>Wheels to Wellness</s>” [“Wellness on Wheels”], a mobile vaccination clinic using transit buses in areas with gaps in equity.&nbsp; Transit agencies in both urban and rural communities across the country have also waived fares to vaccination sites.&nbsp; In rural south-central Texas, Spartan Public Transit has provided free bus rides to appointments and assigned staff to help residents find the nearest vaccination site accessible by transit.&nbsp;<br><br>And since April, Pueblo Transit in Colorado has offered free bus rides for all residents to the FEMA community vaccination center at the Colorado State Fairgrounds.&nbsp;<br><br>These local efforts are incredible, and we encourage everyone in these communities please take advantage of them.&nbsp;<br><br>And today, we are calling on every governor and local leader across the country to ensure that your state, county, city, or town provides at least one free accessible public transit and paratransit opportunity for your constituents during this month of action.&nbsp; And the Federal Transportation Authority will support your transit agency&#8217;s vaccination efforts by awarding grants to cover 100 percent of these expenses.&nbsp;<br><br>So, as I said earlier, we absolutely cannot beat this virus without making sure there&#8217;s a plan that works for all communities and for everyone to get vaccinated.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve made incredible progress.&nbsp; Getting vaccinated now is easier than ever.&nbsp; You can text your ZIP code, as you&#8217;ve heard, to 438829.&nbsp; You will be given the addresses of those vaccination sites &#8212; the three closest to you &#8212; but you will also be asked whether you&#8217;re in need of childcare or transportation support during your vaccination.&nbsp;<br><br>So the Biden-Harris administration is committed to addressing barriers, and we&#8217;re not going to leave anyone behind in this response.&nbsp;<br><br>So, thank you.&nbsp; And with that, I&#8217;ll turn it back over to Andy and also add my gratitude to you for your service.&nbsp; And you will be missed, my friend.<br><br>ACTING ADMINISTRATOR SLAVITT:&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Thank you so much, Dr. Nunez-Smith.&nbsp;<br><br>Kevin, let&#8217;s take some questions.<br><br>MODERATOR:&nbsp; All right.&nbsp; First question, let&#8217;s go to Dave Shepardson at Reuters.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks for &#8212; thanks for that.&nbsp; Two &#8212; two quick questions.&nbsp; Dr. Walensky, has the CDC decided whether to let the residential eviction ban expire on June 30th?&nbsp; And can you talk a bit about, you know, the ongoing discussions about the 212(f) restrictions, given that some countries now have higher rates of infections that do not have any restrictions and some countries are still covered that have very low rates?&nbsp; Is it time to rethink the 212(f)?<br><br>DR. WALENSKY: &nbsp;Thank you for those questions, Dave.&nbsp; We are in discussions about what will happen with eviction order for when it expires, so I don&#8217;t have any updates there.<br><br>With regard to 212(f), this, of course, is an interagency conversation, and we are looking at the data in real time as to how we should move forward with that.&nbsp;<br><br>And so &#8212; and for &#8212; in fact, you know, as you heard from Dr. Fauci earlier, as we look at those conversa- &#8212; as we have those conversations, we need to include data regarding where things &#8212; there are more cases and data related to variants &#8212; ongoing conversations.&nbsp;<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>ACTING ADMINISTRATOR SLAVITT:&nbsp; Next question.<br><br>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Ebony McMorris at the American Urban Radio Network.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, thank you.&nbsp; This is for Dr. Walensky.&nbsp; Within the African American community, there&#8217;s still only 25 percent that have received just on one vaccination shot.&nbsp; And I know the President rolled out, you know, the National Month of Action. However, how is that correlating now?&nbsp; What is the response that you are seeing?&nbsp;<br><br>And the second part to that is: I hear what you&#8217;re doing with employers.&nbsp; Is there also a push to work with Black churches in the community to maybe do some on-site vaccination since that&#8217;s also a center organization within Black communities?<br><br>DR. WALENSKY:&nbsp; Dr. Nunez-Smith, do you want to take that?&nbsp; Or you&#8217;d like me to?<br><br>DR. NUNEZ-SMITH:&nbsp; Yeah, I&#8217;m absolutely happy to speak to that, and thanks for the question.&nbsp; You know, we remain, you know, across the entire government, extremely committed and centered on equity in the response.&nbsp;<br><br>We know that there is still much work to do, despite the progress that we&#8217;ve been discussing.&nbsp; You know, to your first point around the numbers of the data: You know, unfortunately we still are dealing with challenges in the completeness of our data, so it&#8217;s hard to know exactly in terms of those numbers.&nbsp; But we are pushing, absolutely, the comprehensive efforts to make sure that we meet people where they are, that we address all the structural barriers, and to your key point, that the partnerships are deep with community leaders, faith-based leaders, organizations.&nbsp;<br><br>And so there are indeed efforts &#8212; and, you&#8217;re right, have been extremely successful in partnering with houses of worship, the Black church.&nbsp; The President also announced a new initiative, “Shots at the Shop,” partnering with barbershops and beauty salons.&nbsp; So, making sure that we connect people, it&#8217;s easy, it&#8217;s convenient, and people have their questions answered.<br><br>DR. WALENSKY:&nbsp; And I&#8217;ll just add that CDC has toolkits available for all of these local settings.&nbsp; If there&#8217;s a faith-based organization that wants a toolkit for how to get engaged, we have those &#8212; those toolkits available.&nbsp; Same with community-based organizations.<br><br>DR. FAUCI:&nbsp; With regard to on-site vaccination: Just to mention, Andy, as you said yesterday, I had the privilege of being with &#8212; and Sunday &#8212; with the First Lady when we visited the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem.&nbsp; And as far as on-site vaccinations, in the basement of there, they had everything set up with registration, pre-counseling, vaccination observation.&nbsp; It looked like a veritable clinic, and that was within the Abyssinian Baptist Church in the middle of Harlem.&nbsp; So it is happening in sight.<br><br>ACTING ADMINISTRATOR SLAVITT:&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s go to the next question.&nbsp;<br><br>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Jeannie Baumann at Bloomberg.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, thanks so much for taking my question.&nbsp; Dr. Fauci, I was wondering &#8212; I know NIH is working on boosters for the B135.&nbsp; And I was wondering, given what you just were talking about with the delta, if the lab is working on those boosters as well.<br><br>DR. FAUCI:&nbsp; As of yet, there is not a trial that is specific, in the sense of variant-specific boost.&nbsp; You know, we did it with others, but not that.<br><br>Importantly, Jeannie, I want to point out that there are two ways to approach boosting: One is boosting against the original wild-type for which a person was originally vaccinated, and the other is a variant-specific boost.<br><br>We are approaching both of those, but the one thing that we are noticing that&#8217;s important is that the higher your degree of immune response against the wild-type, the greater the secondary coverage you have against a wide array of variants, which is the reason why, as we have reported in previous press briefings, that when you look at particularly the double doses &#8212; primary and boost of the mRNA vaccines, which we have the most data &#8212; there is rather good protection that spills over against multiple variants.<br><br>So, you can boost against the wild type and still cover variants, including 617.&nbsp; So the answer is: Yes, we&#8217;re studying it definitely from a boost to the wild type.&nbsp; We haven&#8217;t yet done a study against the 617, but I believe we will get protection heightened by a boost against the wild type.<br><br>ACTING ADMINISTRATOR SLAVITT:&nbsp; Right.&nbsp; Next question.<br><br>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Meg Tirrel at CNBC.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, thanks.&nbsp; I wanted to ask about the release from Governor DeWine in Ohio yesterday.&nbsp; He said that there are about 200,000 doses of the J&amp;J vaccine in the state, which will expire on June 23rd if they&#8217;re not used.&nbsp; And he pointed out there&#8217;s no legal way for them to share the vaccine with other states or countries.&nbsp; I just wondered if there are any solutions for that, if the state itself can&#8217;t use those doses to get them to a place that could use them before they expire.<br><br>And separately, I also wanted to ask just for some reflection on the importance of trials in kids under age 12, with Pfizer starting its phase 2/3 in kids ages 5 to 11 today, and the fact that they&#8217;re testing such lower doses &#8212; 10 micrograms &#8212; and then, for even younger kids, 3 micrograms, which is a third and a tenth of the adult dose.&nbsp; If you could just comment on the significance of that lower dose for kids and the significance of these trials in general.&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp;<br><br>ACTING ADMINISTRATOR SLAVITT:&nbsp; So, why don&#8217;t I take the question about Ohio, and, Dr. Fauci, if you don&#8217;t mind, to take the question about the dosing and the trials for younger children.&nbsp;<br><br>So, look, our first goal and our first opportunity is that every dose that’s been ordered by a governor in a state gets used.&nbsp; There are plenty of people across the country, in every state, that still haven&#8217;t been vaccinated, that are eligible, that are at risk and need to get vaccinated.&nbsp;<br><br>There is a very, very small fraction of doses that have been sent out to states that will ultimately not be used.&nbsp; This will be &#8212; these will be fractional amounts and really will not have any significant bearing on our ability to commit to distribute vaccines globally.<br><br>We are going to be distributing &#8212; as the President committed, by the end of July &#8212; 80 million doses globally.&nbsp; And we have, you know &#8212; as the President has said, we&#8217;re going to make this country a hub of activity of manufacturing, distribution, promotion of vaccines in far greater numbers.&nbsp;<br><br>So, we would also &#8212; final, small point is &#8212; would encourage every governor to &#8212; who has doses that they worry may be expiring, to work with the FDA directly on the proper storage procedures as we continue to examine, as they continue to examine processes that will allow the doses to potentially last longer as they go through those trials.&nbsp;<br><br>Dr. Fauci, do you want to take the other piece?&nbsp;<br><br>DR. FAUCI:&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Thank you, Andy.&nbsp; A good question.&nbsp; The idea of when you&#8217;re going from an adult trial with adult doses: We do standard &#8212; this isn&#8217;t anything unusual &#8212; what&#8217;s called an “age de-escalation” and a “dose de-escalation” study where you actually go from 12 years to 9, 9 to 6, 6 to 2, and then 6 months to 2 years.<br><br>And when you get down to the younger children, it is not at all unusual to diminish the dose &#8212; as you pointed out &#8212; when it goes down to 10 and then when you go down even lower to 3, which is entirely compatible with the way you do both age and dose de-escalation studies.&nbsp;<br><br>ACTING ADMINISTRATOR SLAVITT:&nbsp; Next question.&nbsp;<br><br>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Kaitlan Collins, CNN.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks very much.&nbsp; Andy, just one quick question to follow up on what you just said.&nbsp; You said that the doses are supposed to be out &#8212; the 80 million &#8212; by the end of July.&nbsp; I just want to confirm that is supposed to be the end of June, right?&nbsp;<br><br>And then, my other question &#8212; just to follow up on the J&amp;J doses &#8212; you said it&#8217;s a small fraction that is set to expire, but the Wall Street Journal says it&#8217;s millions of doses that are set to expire by the end of the month.&nbsp; So, even if these states and these governors are contacting the FDA, what is the federal government&#8217;s plan to make sure that, you know, not even a single dose goes to waste?&nbsp;<br><br>ACTING ADMINISTRATOR SLAVITT:&nbsp; Yeah, so I believe you&#8217;re right about June, but I may have been confused.&nbsp; So we&#8217;ll get &#8212; we’ll make sure that we&#8217;re straightening that out.&nbsp;<br><br>The &#8212; look, it&#8217;s not realistic to expect that not a single dose will go to waste.&nbsp; I would tell you that a very, very small fraction of the doses that have been sent to states, that are in the hundreds of millions, will end up not being used.&nbsp; Remember, those doses were ordered by states, delivered by states, and should end up in people&#8217;s arms.&nbsp; And we are working aggressively through this month of action and other steps to try to get those doses into arms.&nbsp;<br><br>But inevitably, you know, you would, in looking at this, Kaitlan, you would choose speed over making sure that every single dose got into someone&#8217;s arms and wasn&#8217;t wasted; you would choose equity over making sure that there wasn&#8217;t a single wasted dose.&nbsp;<br><br>Those are values we&#8217;ve continued to prioritize &#8212; speed and equity &#8212; as the most important things.&nbsp; And that means that, inevitably, there will be situations where that will happen.&nbsp;<br><br>Now, again, the FDA is looking at opportunities for continued storage.&nbsp; And we, of course, are continuing to look at opportunity for continued delivery of those doses.&nbsp; So, my advice: You want to win a million bucks?&nbsp; Go get vaccinated and we can use these doses.&nbsp;<br><br>I think I answered all your questions, Kaitlan, I believe.&nbsp; If I didn&#8217;t, please let me know.&nbsp; But if not, Kevin, back to you for another question, if there is one.&nbsp;<br><br>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Let&#8217;s go to last question. &nbsp;Zeke at AP.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks for doing this.&nbsp; I was hoping, Dr. Fauci, you might be able to weigh in on the potential consequences of the U.S. falling short of the President’s 70 percent vaccination target by July 4th.&nbsp; Is there a practical impact for the country at large?&nbsp;<br><br>And then specifically to those states and communities where the vaccination rate, you know, isn&#8217;t just close to 70, it&#8217;s significantly short of that threshold, what are the real-world impacts for those communities that have not been able to drive vaccination up?&nbsp;<br><br>And then just, sorry, one follow-up to Andy: You just suggested that, you know, those were &#8212; states ordered those doses and it&#8217;s on them to deliver.&nbsp; Are states not doing their part in some of these areas where the vaccination rate isn&#8217;t high enough to get those doses into arms?&nbsp; Is there more those states should be doing?&nbsp;<br><br>DR. FAUCI:&nbsp; Well, let me take the first part of it, Zeke.&nbsp; Good question.&nbsp; When goals are set, they&#8217;re set to be able to stimulate us to get to that goal.&nbsp; If you don&#8217;t meet the precise goal and you fall short by a few percent, that doesn&#8217;t mean you stop in your effort to get people vaccinated.&nbsp;<br><br>We have always held that July 4th is not the end of it.&nbsp; We want to reach 70 percent of the adult population by the Fourth of July.&nbsp; I believe we can; I hope we will.&nbsp; And if we don&#8217;t, we&#8217;re going to continue to keep pushing.&nbsp; As you know, this is the month of action for what we&#8217;re doing, and we&#8217;re putting a lot of effort into it.&nbsp;<br><br>When you ask about the consequences, Zeke, it gets back to what we have said all along &#8212; literally almost every single time we&#8217;ve had a briefing &#8212; why it&#8217;s so important.&nbsp; And you&#8217;re right, there are some states that are falling well below the 50 percent, and those are the states that we are, in many respects &#8212; I use the word “almost pleading with them” &#8212; on the basis of what I showed in my presentation just a few minutes ago: of why it is so important to get vaccinated.&nbsp; And if we can galvanize that group that still for one reason or other does not want to get vaccinated, we can reach the 70 and go well beyond it as we get into the summer.&nbsp;<br><br>So, the consequences &#8212; we all know; it&#8217;s a fact: If you don&#8217;t get vaccinated, you are at risk.&nbsp; If you get vaccinated, you dramatically &#8212; dramatically diminish the risk of getting infected and almost eliminate the risk of serious disease; why it&#8217;s so, so important for all of us to seriously consider vaccination if you have not already been vaccinated.<br><br>And, Andy, back to you.<br><br>ACTING ADMINISTRATOR SLAVITT: Yeah, Zeke, to your other question.&nbsp; You know, remember that, not so long ago, we were in a much more acute phase of this crisis.&nbsp; Governors were doing their jobs as the best they could, ordering as many doses as they felt they needed to be able to combat this very significant threat.&nbsp; And as we&#8217;ve seen, the vaccines that have been distributed, they have done their jobs as they should.&nbsp; But in places where we haven&#8217;t reached that goal yet, we remain very focused on helping those states.<br><br>So I would not say that we feel like someone hasn&#8217;t, quote unquote, “done their jobs,” Zeke.&nbsp; I would say we feel like it is hard work.&nbsp; And all the things you hear Dr. Nunez-Smith talking about and other people who get on to these calls, and all the initiatives that we announced that we&#8217;re working on are because it is hard work.&nbsp; And we are prepared to work with any state and every state to make sure that every last person has an opportunity to be vaccinated because it is so important, and it is such an important focus.<br><br>Well, thank you again for the question.&nbsp; And a final thanks to all the press for attending these briefings and in helping us inform the public.&nbsp; And we will look forward to the following &#8212; the next briefing.&nbsp; Thank you very much.<br><br>10:56 A.M. EDT</p>

<p>Almost twenty-six years ago, Ratko Mladic ordered the summary execution of some 8,000 unarmed men and boys in Srebrenica. He also led the brutal years-long siege of Sarajevo and was responsible for many other crimes. Today, the United Nations International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals in The Hague affirmed his conviction for genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes. This historic judgment shows that those who commit horrific crimes will be held accountable. It also reinforces our shared resolve to prevent future atrocities from occurring anywhere in the world.</p>



<p>The United States helped lead the international effort to end the atrocities in Bosnia and Herzegovina, to bring to justice those who committed crimes there and in other parts of the former Yugoslavia, and to establish a lasting peace to that country and the broader region. We are grateful for the tireless work of the UN tribunals over the past two decades on cases related to the conflict in the Balkans and all those whose dedication made this judgment possible.</p>



<p>Justice and reconciliation are the foundation for peace and stability for the future, and today’s decision is also an important confirmation that this is possible. I sincerely hope leaders in the region will respect this judgment and reinforce its importance for the rule of law.</p>



<p>My thoughts today are with all the surviving families of the many victims of Mladic’s atrocities. We can never erase the tragedy of their deaths, but I hope today’s judgment provides some solace to all those who are grieving.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong>100-Day Review Outlines Steps to Strengthen Critical Supply Chains<br></strong><br><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/100-day-supply-chain-review-report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>FINAL REPORT</strong></a></p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/100-day-supply-chain-review-report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">key findings</a> from the reviews directed under Executive Order (E.O.) 14017 “America’s Supply Chains,” as well as immediate actions the Administration will take to strengthen American supply chains to promote economic security, national security, and good-paying, union jobs here at home.</p>



<p>On February 24, 2021, the President signed E.O. 14017, directing a whole-of-government approach to assessing vulnerabilities in, and strengthening the resilience of, critical supply chains. Stemming from that effort, the Biden-Harris Administration has already begun to take steps to address supply chain vulnerabilities:</p>



<ul><li>The Administration’s COVID-19 Response Team has drastically expanded the manufacture of vaccines and other essential supplies, enabling more than 137 million Americans to get fully vaccinated.<br></li><li>The Administration has also worked with companies that manufacture and use semiconductor chips to identify improvements in supply chain management practices that can strengthen the semiconductor supply chain over time.<br></li><li>The Department of Defense (DOD) has announced an investment in the expansion of the largest rare earth element mining and processing company outside of China to provide the raw materials necessary to help combat the climate crisis.&nbsp;</li><li>And the Biden-Harris Administration is working to address critical cyber vulnerabilities to U.S. supply chains and critical infrastructure, including issuing E.O. 14028 on “Improving the Nation’s Cyber Security” just last month.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Today, building on these efforts, the Administration released findings from the comprehensive 100-day supply chain assessments for four critical products: semiconductor manufacturing and advanced packaging; large capacity batteries, like those for electric vehicles; critical minerals and materials; and pharmaceuticals and active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). The Administration is taking immediate action to address vulnerabilities and strengthen resilience with the launch of a new effort aimed at addressing near-term supply chain disruptions. And, pursuant to E.O. 14017, it is crafting strategies for six industrial bases that underpin America’s economic and national security, which will be completed within a year. The supply chain reviews reinforce the need for the transformative investments proposed in the President’s American Jobs Plan. &nbsp;</p>



<p>These efforts are critical because, as the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting economic crisis have shown, structural weaknesses in both domestic and international supply chains threaten America’s economic and national security. While amplified by the public health and economic crisis, decades of underinvestment and public policy choices led to fragile supply chains across a range of sectors and products. Unfair trade practices by competitor nations and private sector and public policy prioritization of low-cost labor, just-in-time production, consolidation, and private sector focus on short-term returns over long-term investment have hollowed out the U.S. industrial base, siphoned innovation from the United States, and stifled wage and productivity growth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the same time, the reviews find that the United States is well-positioned to maintain and strengthen our innovative leadership and rebuild our productive capacity in key sectors and value-chains. Our unparalleled university and research systems, skilled and diverse workforce, ecosystem of entrepreneurs and small businesses, and position as a global leader with strong relationships with allies and partners are the building blocks to revitalizing domestic competitiveness and strengthening supply chains. Working together, industry, labor, the government, and other stakeholders can chart a new path forward that emphasizes resilience and security, as well as broad-based growth and tackling the climate crisis.</p>



<p><strong><u>Taking Action to Address Vulnerabilities in Critical Product Supply Chains</u></strong><br><br>The actions the Biden-Harris Administration announced today are the first step in a whole-of-government effort to strengthen domestic competitiveness and supply chain resilience. To address vulnerabilities in the supply chains of the four critical products identified by E.O. 14017, the Biden-Harris Administration will immediately:</p>



<p><strong><em>Support domestic production of critical medicines</em></strong></p>



<ul><li>The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), under the Defense Production Act (DPA) and building on current public-private partnerships, will establish a public-private consortium for advanced manufacturing and onshoring of domestic essential medicines production. The consortium’s first task will be to select 50-100 critical drugs, drawn from the Food and Drug Administration’s <a href="https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/reports/executive-order-13944-list-essential-medicines-medical-countermeasures-and-critical-inputs">essential medicines list</a>, to be the focus of an enhanced onshoring effort.<br></li><li>HHS will make an initial commitment of approximately $60 million from the Defense Production Act appropriation in the American Rescue Plan to develop novel platform technologies to increase domestic manufacturing capacity for API. Greater API production domestically will help reduce reliance on global supply chains for medications that are in shortage, particularly during times of increased public health need.</li></ul>



<p><strong><em>Secure an end-to-end domestic supply chain for advanced batteries</em></strong></p>



<ul><li>The Department of Energy (DOE) will release a National Blueprint for Lithium Batteries. This Blueprint will codify the findings of the battery supply chain review in a 10-year, whole-of-government plan to urgently develop a domestic lithium battery supply chain that combats the climate crisis by creating good-paying clean energy jobs across America. Later this month, the Department of Energy will host a Battery Roundtable, including representatives from each segment of the battery supply chain, to discuss the Blueprint.<br></li><li>DOE’s Loan Programs Office (LPO) will immediately leverage the approximately $17 billion in loan authority in the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program (ATVM) to support the domestic battery supply chain. LPO will leverage full statutory authority to finance key strategic areas of development and fill deficits in the domestic supply chain capacity. This will include the ATVM program making loans to manufacturers of advanced technology vehicle battery cells and packs for re-equipping, expanding or establishing such manufacturing facilities in the United States.<br></li><li>DOE’s Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) will launch a new effort to support deployment of energy storage projects by federal agencies. It will begin with a federal government-wide energy storage review that will evaluate the current opportunity for deploying battery storage at federal sites. FEMP will also launch a call for projects from federal sites interested in deploying energy storage projects, and provide the necessary technical assistance to get those projects built. These actions build on steps taken earlier this year to leverage $13 million in FEMP’s Assisting Federal Facilities with Energy Conservation Technologies grants to unlock an estimated $260 million or more in project investments, including battery storage projects.</li></ul>



<p><strong><em>Invest in sustainable domestic and international production and processing of critical minerals</em></strong></p>



<ul><li>The Department of Interior (DOI), with the support of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, will establish a working group composed of agencies such as the Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to identify sites where critical minerals could be produced and processed in the United States while adhering to the highest environmental, labor, and sustainability standards. This working group will collaborate with the private sector, states, Tribal Nations, and stakeholders—including representatives of labor, impacted communities, and environmental justice leaders—to expand sustainable, responsible critical minerals production and processing in the United States.<br></li><li>The Administration will establish an interagency team composed of staff from agencies including DOI, USDA, EPA, and others with expertise in mine permitting and environmental law. This team will identify gaps in statutes and regulations that may need to be updated by Congress to ensure: new production meets strong standards before mining begins, during the mining process, and after mining ends; meaningful community engagement and consultation with Tribal Nations, respecting the government-to-government relationship at all stages of the mining process; and opportunities to reduce time, cost, and risk of permitting without compromising strong environmental and consultation benchmarks are fully explored.&nbsp;<br></li><li>DOD will deploy DPA Title III incentives—including grants, loans, loan guarantees, and offtake agreements—to support sustainably-produced strategic and critical materials, including scaling proven research and development (R&amp;D) concepts and emerging technologies from other programs such as the Small Business Innovation Research awardees.<br></li><li>The DOE LPO, through its Title 17 Renewable Energy and Efficiency Energy Projects solicitation, has more than $3 billion in loan guarantees available to support efficient end-use energy technologies, such as mining, extraction, processing, recovery, or recycling technologies, of critical materials projects that satisfy Title 17 requirements.<br></li><li>The U.S. Development Finance Corporation will expand international investments in projects that will increase production capacity for critical products, including critical minerals and other products identified pursuant to the E.O. 14017 process, ensuring that investments that support supply chain resilience and uphold international standards of environmental and social performance.</li></ul>



<p><strong><em>Partner with industry, allies, and partners to address semiconductor shortages</em></strong></p>



<ul><li>Through strategic engagement with industry, the Department of Commerce (DOC) has supported nearly $75 billion in direct investments from the private sector in domestic semiconductor manufacturing and R&amp;D. DOC will bolster its partnership with industry to facilitate information flow between semiconductor producers and suppliers and end-users. Leveraging the Department’s convening power, including through its advisory committees, DOC will bring stakeholders together to promote improved transparency and data sharing.<br></li><li>Building on the success of recent engagements with Japan and the Republic of Korea, including the announcement of more than $17 billion in U.S. semiconductor investments by leading companies in ROK, the Administration will strengthen engagement with allies and partners to promote fair semiconductor chip allocations, increase production, and promote increased investment.</li></ul>



<p><strong><u>Building Fair and Sustainable Industrial Bases</u></strong><br>In addition to the immediate actions taken in the supply chains of the critical products identified in E.O. 14017, the Administration is also announcing a series of actions to be taken across the Federal government to support supply chain resilience, workforce development, production and innovation, and strong sustainability and labor standards at home and abroad.</p>



<p>The Administration will:</p>



<p><strong><em>Support American workers and innovation</em></strong></p>



<ul><li>The Department of Labor (DOL) will announce later this month more than $100 million in grants to support state-led apprenticeship expansion efforts as well as establish national Registered Apprenticeship Technical Assistance Centers of Excellence. The Apprenticeship Occupations and Standards Center of Excellence will provide support and technical assistance to employers and industry to build out model registered apprenticeship programs in critical supply chains.<br></li><li>DOE will announce a new policy to ensure that all innovations that are developed with taxpayer dollars through DOE’s Science and Energy Programs require awardees to substantially manufacture those products in the United States, creating good-paying domestic jobs. This change will cover more than $8 billion in clean energy and climate innovation funding requested in the President’s Budget for Fiscal Year 2022, as well as future fiscal year spending. DOE will implement these actions through a Determination of Exceptional Circumstances under the Bayh-Dole Act. Additionally, the Administration will establish an interagency working group to identify best practices to develop and implement further improvements across the government.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></li></ul>



<p><strong><em>Invest in sustainable supply chains at home and abroad</em></strong></p>



<ul><li>The Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council, in connection with the implementation of Executive Order 14005, “Ensuring the Future is Made in America with All of America’s Workers,” plans to issue a proposed rule to develop a new process for preferencing critical products that are in manufactured products or component parts, under the Buy American Act. This will leverage the buying power of the nearly $600 billion in federal contracting to strengthen domestic supply chains for critical products.&nbsp;<br></li><li>USDA will commit more than $4 billion in a new, robust suite of Build Back Better initiatives focused on rebuilding the U.S. food system and strengthening and diversifying supply chains for food production, food processing, food distribution and aggregation, and markets and consumers. Build Back Better efforts by USDA will seek to provide improved access to nutritious food, address racial equity and justice as well as climate change, make markets fair and competitive, provide ongoing support for producers and workers, and create greater resilience in the food supply chain.<br></li><li>The President will convene a global forum on supply chain resilience that will bring together key government officials and private sector stakeholders from across key U.S. allies and partners to collectively assess vulnerabilities, develop common approaches to supply chain challenges, and work to build strength through diversity and shared prosperity.</li></ul>



<p><strong><em>Combat unfair trade practices</em></strong></p>



<ul><li>The Administration will establish a trade strike force led by the U.S. Trade Representative to propose unilateral and multilateral enforcement actions against unfair foreign trade practices that have eroded critical supply chains. The trade strike force will also identify opportunities to use trade agreements to strengthen collective approaches to supply chain resilience with U.S. partners and allies.<br></li><li>DOC will evaluate whether to initiate an investigation into neodymium magnets, which are critical inputs in motors and other devices, and are important to both defense and civilian industrial uses, under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962.</li></ul>



<p><strong><u>Tackling Near-Term Supply Chain Disruptions As the Economy Reopens<br></u></strong><br>The Administration’s historic vaccination and economic relief efforts have spurred a rapid return of economic activity. As the United States and the broader global economy emerge from the pandemic, we have seen signs of new pressures on supply chains due to changes in demand. While these short-term supply chain disruptions are temporary, the President has directed his Administration to closely monitor these developments and take actions to minimize the impacts on workers, consumers, and businesses in order to bolster a strong economic recovery. To address these challenges, the Administration will:</p>



<p><strong><em>Establish a whole-of-government effort to monitor and address transitory supply chain challenges</em></strong></p>



<ul><li>The Administration will establish new Supply Chain Disruptions Task Force to provide a whole-of-government response to address near-term supply chain challenges to the economic recovery. The Task Force will be led by the Secretaries of Commerce, Transportation, and Agriculture and will focus on areas where a mismatch between supply and demand has been evident: homebuilding and construction, semiconductors, transportation, and agriculture and food. The Task Force will bring the full capacity of the federal government to address near-term supply/demand mismatches. It will convene stakeholders to diagnose problems and surface solutions—large and small, public or private—that could help alleviate bottlenecks and supply constraints.&nbsp;<br></li><li>DOC will lead a coordinated effort to bring together data from across the federal government to improve the federal government’s ability to track supply and demand disruptions and facilitate information sharing between federal agencies and the private sector to more effectively identify near term risks and vulnerabilities.</li></ul>



<p><strong><u>Charting A New Course: Toward a Long-Term Strategy for Strengthening U.S. Supply Chain Resilience<br></u></strong><br>President Biden believes this is the moment to reimagine and rebuild a new American economy, not go back to the way things used to be. The report delivered to the President offers six sets of recommendations that, collectively, will not only strengthen the four prioritized supply chains, but will rebuild the U.S. industrial base and restart our innovation engine.</p>



<p>The supply chain reviews reinforce the need for the transformative investments proposed in the President’s American Jobs Plan. The American Jobs Plan will make a once-in-a-generation capital investment to create millions of good-paying jobs, rebuild our country’s infrastructure, and position the U.S. to compete globally in key industries. This agenda aligns with and reinforces the Administration’s strategy outlined above to invest in US supply chain resilience.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Key Recommendations Include:<br></em><br><strong><em>Rebuild America’s production and innovation capabilities. </em></strong>Long-term competitiveness will require an ecosystem of production, innovation, skilled workers, and diverse small and medium-sized suppliers. Those ecosystems are the infrastructure needed to spur private sector investment in manufacturing and innovation. But that infrastructure cannot be created or sustained without the support and leadership of the federal government. Specific recommendations to rebuild our industrial base for critical sectors include:</p>



<ul><li><em>Provide dedicated funding for semiconductor manufacturing and R&amp;D: We recommend </em>Congress support at least $50 billion in investments to advance domestic manufacturing of critical semiconductors and promote semiconductor R&amp;D.<br></li><li><em>Provide funding and financial incentives to spur consumer adoption of EVs and other EV incentives:</em> We recommend Congress authorize new and expanded incentives to spur consumer adoption of U.S.-made electric vehicles. In addition, we recommend Congress support $5 billion in investments to electrify the federal fleet with U.S.-made EVs, and $15 billion in infrastructure investment to build out a national charging infrastructure to facilitate the adoptions of EVs.<br></li><li><em>Provide financing to support advanced battery production:</em> DOE should use existing authorities and funding to support U.S. manufacturing of advanced technology vehicle battery cells.<br></li><li><em>Establish a new Supply Chain Resilience Program:</em> We recommend Congress enact a Supply Chain Resilience Program at DOC to create a focal point within the government to monitor and address supply chain challenges. This program should be backed with $50 billion to make transformative investments in strengthening U.S. supply chains across a range of critical products. &nbsp;<br></li><li><em>Deploy the DPA to expand production capacity in critical industries: </em>A DPA Action Group should determine how best to leverage the authorities of the DPA to strengthen supply chain resilience, building off work done to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.<br></li><li><em>Invest in the development of next generation batteries:</em> Agencies should support technologies that will reduce the critical mineral requirements for next generation electric vehicle batteries and grid storage technologies, and that improve U.S. competitiveness in this critical sector.<br></li><li><em>Invest in the development of new pharmaceutical manufacturing processes: </em>Agencies should increase their funding of advanced manufacturing technologies to increase production of key pharmaceuticals and ingredients, including using both traditional manufacturing techniques and on-demand manufacturing capabilities for supportive care fluids, APIs, and finished dosage form drugs.<br></li><li><em>Work with industry and labor to create pathways to quality jobs, with a free and fair choice to join a union, through sector-based community college partnerships, apprenticeships and on-the-job training:</em> DOL’s Employment and Training Administration should support sector-based pathways to jobs, for example in the semiconductor industry.&nbsp;<br></li><li><em>Invest in small, medium and disadvantaged businesses in critical supply chains: </em>The Small Business Innovation Research and Small Business Technology Transfer competitive programs should support a diverse portfolio of small businesses to meet R&amp;D needs, and increase commercialization.&nbsp;<br></li><li><em>Examine the ability of the U.S. Export-Import Bank (EXIM) to use existing authorities to support U.S. manufacturing of products:</em> EXIM should develop a proposal for Board consideration regarding whether EXIM should establish a new Domestic Financing Program that would provide financing to support the establishment and/or expansion of U.S. manufacturing facilities and infrastructure projects in the United States that would facilitate U.S. exports.</li></ul>



<p><strong><em>Support the development of markets that invest in workers, value sustainability, and drive quality. </em></strong>These reports identify key areas where government could play a more active role in setting standards and incentivizing high-road business practices. By establishing strong domestic standards and advocating for the establishment of global standards, the United States can support the private sector’s ability to create and adopt sustainable and resilient practices.</p>



<ul><li><em>Create 21<sup>st</sup> century standards for the extraction and processing of critical minerals at home and abroad: </em>The government, working with private sector and non-governmental stakeholders, should encourage the development and adoption of comprehensive sustainability standards for essential minerals, such as lithium, cobalt, nickel, copper, rare earth elements, and other materials.<br></li><li><em>Identify potential sustainable production and processing locations for critical minerals:&nbsp; </em>The United States’ non-fuel mineral resources are significantly under-mapped relative to those of other developed nations. Congress should fully resource programs like the U.S. Geological Survey’s Mineral Resources Program at DOI to develop a comprehensive map of domestic critical mineral resources and reserves.<br></li><li><em>Improve transparency throughout the pharmaceuticals supply chain:</em> HHS should develop and make recommendations to Congress on new authorities that would allow HHS to track production by facility, track API sourcing, and require that API and finished dosage form sources be identified on labeling for all pharmaceuticals sold in the United States.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p><strong><em>Leverage the government’s role as a purchaser and investor in critical goods.</em></strong> As a significant customer and investor, the Federal Government has the capacity to shape the market for many critical products. The public sector can deploy this power in times of crisis, as in the case of Operation Warp Speed, or in normal times. The Administration should leverage this role to strengthen supply chain resilience and support national priorities.</p>



<ul><li><em>Reform and strengthen U.S. stockpiles</em>: The Administration and Congress should take actions to recapitalize and restore the National Defense Stockpile of critical minerals and materials. In the private sector, industries that have faced shortages of critical goods should evaluate mechanisms to strengthen corporate stockpiles of select critical products to ensure greater resilience in times of disruption.<br></li><li><em>Ensure that new automotive battery production in the United States adheres to high labor standards: </em>Tax credits, lending and grants offered to businesses to produce batteries domestically should ensure the creation of quality jobs with the free and fair choice to organize and bargain collectively for workers.</li></ul>



<p><strong><em>Strengthen international trade rules, including trade enforcement mechanisms.</em></strong> While fair competition from abroad is welcome, too often unfair foreign subsidies and other trade practices have adversely impacted U.S. manufacturing and more broadly, U.S. competitiveness. The U.S. government must implement a comprehensive strategy to push back on unfair foreign competition that erodes the resilience of U.S. critical supply chains and industries.</p>



<ul><li><em>Develop a comprehensive trade strategy to support fair and resilient supply chains: </em>The Administration should develop a comprehensive trade strategy to support supply chain resilience and U.S. competitiveness. Supply chain resilience should be incorporated into the U.S. trade policy approach towards China, including in the ongoing review of U.S.-China trade policy. The Administration should also examine existing U.S. trade agreements to identify ways to strengthen collective supply chain resilience.</li></ul>



<p><strong><em>Work with allies and partners to decrease vulnerabilities in the global supply chains.</em></strong> The United States cannot address its supply chain vulnerabilities alone. Even as the U.S. makes investments to expand domestic production capacity for some critical products, we must work with allies and partners to secure supplies of critical goods that we will not make in sufficient quantities at home. We must work with America’s allies and partners to strengthen our collective supply chain resilience, while ensuring high standards for labor and environmental practices are upheld.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><em>Use diplomatic tools to encourage and facilitate resilient supply chains: </em>The U.S. should expand multilateral diplomatic engagement on supply chain vulnerabilities, particularly through groupings of like-minded allies such as the Quad and the G7.<br></li><li><em>Leverage financial tools to support sustainable and resilient international supply chains:</em> U.S. development and international finance tools offer a powerful avenue for working with allies and partners to strengthen supply chains for key products. The U.S. should explore initiatives and mechanisms for investing in projects to expand production in critical supply chains. Even as the U.S. expands the manufacture and mining of critical products domestically, it must take steps to ensure that the manufacturing and mining that takes place abroad supports supply chain resilience and meets high labor and environmental standards.</li></ul>



<p><strong><u>Key Findings from 100-Day Critical Product Supply Chain Reviews<br></u></strong><br>The reports being released today document a wide range of risks and vulnerabilities to U.S. supply chains for critical products. Over the course of the year, pursuant to E.O. 14017, the Departments of Transportation, Agriculture, Commerce, Homeland Security, Defense, Energy, and Health and Human Services, working with other Departments and Agencies across the U.S. government, will develop comprehensive strategies for revitalizing six industrial bases: defense, public health and biological preparedness, information and communications technology, energy, transportation, and agriculture and food production.<br><br>Highlights of these risks and vulnerabilities identified by the 100-day reports include:<br><br><strong><em>Semiconductors</em></strong><br><br>Semiconductors are essential to our national security, our economic competitiveness, and to our daily lives. These tiny chips are vital to virtually every sector of the economy—including energy, healthcare, agriculture, consumer electronics, manufacturing, defense, and transportation. &nbsp;Semiconductors power our cell phones and dishwashers; as well as our fighter jets and cybersecurity defenses. Once a global leader in semiconductor production with robust public support, the United States has outsourced and offshored too much semiconductor manufacturing in recent decades. The United States has fallen from 37 percent of global semiconductor production to just 12 percent over the last 20 years.<br><br>The United States also lacks production capability at the most advanced technology levels. For leading edge logic chips, the U.S. and U.S. allies rely primarily on facilities in Taiwan, which produces 92 percent of such chips. Our reliance on imported chips introduces new vulnerabilities into the critical semiconductor supply chain. The United States produces only six to nine percent of the more mature logic chips, which are severely impacted by the current shortage. The loss of production capacity threatens all segments of the semiconductor supply chain as well as our long-term economic competitiveness.<br><br>We must build resilient and competitive semiconductor supply chains for the long-term. Our strategy must include taking defensive actions to protect our technological advantages. But we must also proactively invest in domestic production and R&amp;D. We must develop an ecosystem that includes growing our innovative small, medium, and disadvantaged businesses, along with building a pipeline of skilled workers who can benefit from well-paying semiconductor jobs. &nbsp;Finally, we must engage our partners and allies to promote global resilience.<br><br><strong><em>Large capacity batteries</em></strong><br><br>Advanced, high-capacity batteries play an integral role in 21st-century technologies that are critical to the clean energy transition and national security capabilities around the world—from electric vehicles, to stationary energy storage, to defense applications. Demand for these products is set to grow as supply chain constraints, geopolitical and economic competition, and other vulnerabilities continue to increase.<br><br>Today, America relies heavily on importing the inputs for fabricated advanced battery packs from abroad, exposing the nation to supply chain vulnerabilities that threaten to disrupt the availability and cost of the critical technologies that rely on them and the workforce that manufactures them. With the global lithium battery market expected to grow by a factor of five to ten by 2030, it is imperative that the United States invest immediately in scaling up a secure, diversified supply chain for high-capacity batteries here at home that supports good-paying, quality jobs with a free and fair choice to join a union and bargain collectively. That means seizing a critical opportunity to increase domestic battery manufacturing while investing to scale the full lithium battery supply chain, including the sourcing and processing of the critical minerals used in battery production all the way through to end-of-life battery collection and recycling.<br><br><strong><em>Critical minerals and materials</em></strong><br><br>A range of critical minerals and materials are the building blocks of the products we use every day. As demand for clean energy technology increases over the short- and medium-term, an increased supply of critical minerals and materials will be necessary to meet national and global climate goals. China, using state-led, non-market interventions, captured large portions of value chains in several critical minerals and materials necessary for national and economic security. China accounts for an outsized share of the world’s refining capacity, meaning that even if the United States were to diversify our sources of critical minerals or increase domestic extraction, we would still be reliant on China for processing before use in end-product manufacturing.<br><br>To secure a reliable, sustainable supply of critical minerals and materials, the United States must work with allies and partners to diversify supply chains away from adversarial nations and sources with unacceptable environmental and labor standards. U.S. investments abroad must incentivize environmentally and socially responsible production. The United States must also invest in sustainable production, refining, and recycling capacity domestically, while ensuring strong environmental, environmental justice, and labor standards and meaningful community consultation, including with Tribal Nations through government-to-government collaboration.</p>



<p><strong><em>Pharmaceuticals and APIs</em></strong><br><br>The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the critical importance of a resilient U.S. healthcare manufacturing sector. Private sector innovation and robust federal investment allowed the U.S. to rapidly develop and strengthen COVID-19 supply chains. But the United States remains critically dependent on imports for a range of key pharmaceutical products and APIs—the primary ingredients of generic drugs—which represent 90 percent of all prescription medications filled. About 87 percent of API facilities for generic drugs are located overseas which has left U.S. supply chains of essential medicines vulnerable.<br><br>China and India are estimated to control substantial parts of the supply chain where there have been issues with shortages due to a range of disruptions that have impacted supply as well as quality and safety. The drive toward lower costs as well as unfair trade practices have led to a hollowing out of domestic production. A new approach is needed to ensure more resilient supply chains that includes improving transparency, building emergency capacity, and investing in domestic production.</p>
