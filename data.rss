<p class="has-text-align-center">East Room</p>



<p>4:35 P.M. EDT</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Thank you, Kurt.&nbsp; Thank you, thank you, thank you.<br><br>Secretary &#8212; Secretary Cardona, thank you.&nbsp; And &#8212; and I want to thank Jill.&nbsp; Jill is the nation’s first First Lady to work full time as a professor &#8212; as a teacher.&nbsp; She taught high school and she teaches at a community college for a long time now.<br><br>We made a deal that &#8212; she was so &#8212; teaching is not what Jill does, it’s who she is, like most of you &#8212; who you are, what you believe.&nbsp; And so when we got elected &#8212; the presidency and as Vice President, as well &#8212; I suggested and she agreed fully that she should continue to teach.&nbsp; And people said, “What?”&nbsp; (Laughter.)<br><br>Well, she teaches 14 credits a semester at community college full time, and she does her job.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>And, you know, I’m very, very supportive of teachers for a number of reasons &#8212; some of them are personal.&nbsp; But if I didn’t support teachers, I’d be sleeping alone in one of these bedrooms up here.&nbsp; (Laughter.)<br><br>You know, before I begin the formal comments, one of the things that Jill reminded me of when she spoke &#8212; and I’ll bet all of you can give examples as well &#8212; I &#8212; I had &#8212; I got lucky.&nbsp; I won the &#8212; I won the lottery, in terms of parents; my mother and father were wonderful people.&nbsp; I had one of those moms that everybody wished had been their mom, for real.&nbsp; Everybody hung at my house.</p>



<p>But I also was a bit of a runt, in terms of my size.&nbsp; And I used to ta- &#8212; ta- &#8212; ta- &#8212; talk like this.&nbsp; I stuttered badly.&nbsp; And when you stutter, everyone thinks you have to be either stupid or totally incompetent.</p>



<p>And if you notice, it&#8217;s the only infirmity a child can talk about &#8212; an adult can talk about having had that people &#8212; you didn&#8217;t because you’re teachers &#8212; think they can laugh, think it&#8217;s funny.</p>



<p>If you saw the movie “The King&#8217;s Speech,” you understand.&nbsp; You understand.</p>



<p>We went to see it, Jill and I, and right as the King was standing at the racetrack making the speech, she reached over &#8212; I guess I tightened up somehow; it brought back all &#8212; all the memories.&nbsp;<br><br>And I look back on it now and I wonder, besides I really got lucky with my parents &#8212; my mother would say, “Look at me, Joey.&nbsp; Look at me.&nbsp; You&#8217;re smarter than anybody.&nbsp; You&#8217;re this.&nbsp; You&#8217;re that.&nbsp; So, stop.&nbsp; You can do this.”<br><br>My point is this: that I had teachers &#8212; I can name the ones through grade school, high school, and even college.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t really beat my stuttering, and still occasionally I do, until I was &#8212; took speech and debate class in college just to force myself to be able to stand up.<br><br>When they sent me the copy &#8212; the guy who wrote “The King&#8217;s Speech” found the original speech and made a copy of it and sent it to me &#8212; no, I mean, from the movie.</p>



<p>And he does his speeches exactly like I did, which a nun taught me.&nbsp; If you took a look at my speech, you&#8217;ll see that there&#8217;s all these slash marks in the speech.&nbsp; Because, you know, an awful lot of people who are &#8212; I can&#8217;t sing worth a damn, but the people &#8212; entertainers and singers can sing like a nightingale but can&#8217;t talk, can&#8217;t speak.</p>



<p>And I look back on my life, and I think, beyond my family &#8212; my sister, my brother, my mom, my dad &#8212; the people who made a difference in my life, in a fundamental way, were teachers.</p>



<p>I remember &#8212; I was talking on the way over.&nbsp; This &#8212; my staff is going, “Why aren’t you giving the speech we wrote?”&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>But I remember &#8212; I truly remember &#8212; and we were talking about it on the way over &#8212; what got me involved in politics.&nbsp; I got into politics &#8212; involved in politics because I think the greatest sin that anyone can commit is the abuse of power, whatever that power is &#8212; the power of a teacher, the power of a doctor, the power of a leader.&nbsp; When someone who is relying on you or you cannot &#8212; just the abuse of power.<br><br>And I got involved because my state was the only state in the Union, when Dr. King was murdered, that was occupied by the National Guard for 10 months with drawn bayonets in every corner because we had a very conservative governor who ordered the National Guard and &#8212; because my state has the eighth-largest Black population in America as a percent of population.</p>



<p>And I had a job with the &#8212; one of the oldest law firms in the state.&nbsp; And I quit and became a public defender; that’s what got me involved.</p>



<p>But again, where teachers come in: I was &#8212; I had no intention of running for public office.&nbsp; Everybody thought Biden knew he wanted to be President at the time he was in sixth grade or something.&nbsp; I love these biographies.&nbsp; (Laughter.)<br><br>But here&#8217;s the deal: What I did do &#8212; I wanted to get engaged.&nbsp; And so, we had a very, very conservative Democratic Party in my state.&nbsp; And I thought it was &#8212; I thought it was wrong on civil rights.&nbsp; The more &#8212; the more progressive party was the Republican Party because we were a southern Democratic Party.&nbsp; We&#8217;re a slave state to our great shame, early on.&nbsp; We fought on the side of the North, like Maryland did, and four &#8212; two other states, but we were a border state.</p>



<p>And that&#8217;s what got me going.&nbsp; And so, I was asked by a group of senior lawyers whether or not I’d join a thing called a “New Democratic Coalition.”&nbsp; And the reason I bother to tell you that was how to reform the party, how to bring it into the &#8212; into the &#8212; you know, the 21st century &#8212; the 20th century, at the time.</p>



<p>And &#8212; and one day after being asked to see if I can help recruit someone to run for the United States Senate against a very popular Republ- &#8212; Democ- &#8212; Republican senator, a group of senator &#8212; a former senator, a former congressman, and two former governors came to me and said, “We want you to run.”&nbsp; And I wasn&#8217;t even old enough.&nbsp; I was 29 years old.</p>



<p>And I thought, “This is crazy.”&nbsp; But I remember going home from that convention, and the first stop I made was to speak to a professor in Dr. Ingersoll, who was one of those professors who was my &#8212; my &#8212; my philosophy professor in political science.&nbsp; And I stopped him, and I told him what was going on.&nbsp; And he looked at me, and I&#8217;ll never forget what he said.&nbsp; He said, “You should do it.”&nbsp; I said, “I can&#8217;t do that.”&nbsp; I never even knew anybody who was in the Senate.</p>



<p>And he looked at me; he said, “Remember what Plato said.&nbsp; And I&#8217;ll paraphrase it,” he said.&nbsp; “The penalty good people pay for not being involved in politics is being governed by people worse than themselves.”</p>



<p>But my generic point is this: He gave me the confidence,</p>



<p>as a 29-year-old kid with no money, to run.&nbsp; He gave me the confidence.&nbsp; Just like the nun would tell me, “Joey, Joey, you can do this.”&nbsp; It gave me the confidence.</p>



<p>And I think about it.&nbsp; You&#8217;re going to think about, 20 years from now, how did you end up standing on the podium in the White House?&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; No, you didn&#8217;t ever expect that.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I wonder how I got here.&nbsp; I got here because of my parents and my teachers.&nbsp; My teachers.</p>



<p>And so, folks, you know, that idea is exemplified by the National Teacher of the Year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kurt, you have and I have something in common though.&nbsp; I&#8217;m &#8212; I was an adjunct professor in law school for years teaching an advanced course in separation of powers.&nbsp; And I taught to get &#8212; to get money when I was at Syracuse Law School.&nbsp; To get through law school, I was a substitute teacher.&nbsp; You should be nicer to them.&nbsp; (Laughter and applause.)</p>



<p>But that’s not what Kurt and I have in common.&nbsp; What we have in common is we both married women who are smarter than we are.&nbsp; (Laughter.)</p>



<p>This is an assistant dean at Oberlin College, one of the finest colleges in the country.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>Kurt teaches history; he taught 25 years.&nbsp; In fact, he teaches in the same town, in the same district he grew up in.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, by the way, when I left the vice presidency, I had a chance to do a number of things.&nbsp; But I became a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, and &#8212; presidential politics.&nbsp; And I &#8212; it was &#8212; I enjoyed it, but it&#8217;s hard.&nbsp; That&#8217;s another thing people don&#8217;t realize: It&#8217;s hard.&nbsp; How much you prepare.</p>



<p>I had a three-credit course I taught in law school.&nbsp; I would literally, every single &#8212; I didn&#8217;t want to do it during the week because I didn&#8217;t want people to say I’m taking away from my job as a senator, so I did it on Saturdays at Delaware Law School.</p>



<p>I would prepare &#8212; Jill will tell you &#8212; three to four hours every single &#8212; before every class.&nbsp; And it was what &#8212; not only I taught, but &#8212; what I did as Chairman of the Judiciary Committee.&nbsp; I taught about separation of powers.&nbsp; It was what I did my whole life.&nbsp; And it took me all that time.</p>



<p>But the point is: It really mattered.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You know &#8212; you know, I love what this guy said in his classroom about &#8212; he said his classroom &#8212; he said, “We listen to each other and respect people&#8217;s opinion.”</p>



<p>Well, part of this is all about fundamentally teaching respect.&nbsp; While we might be in the opposite sides of hot topics, we&#8217;re on the same side in terms of having respect for one another.</p>



<p>Well, Kurt, I understand you wanted to go back home to be a teacher because your teachers inspired you.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll bet every one of you can name one or two teachers who fundamentally impacted your lives.</p>



<p>Well, you know, I think you&#8217;ve paid it forward many times over, old buddy, and &#8212; transforming the lives of your students in Oberlin, Ohio, helping students see themselves in you.&nbsp; That&#8217;s what happens, I think.&nbsp; And helping all your students not only learn history, but see &#8212; see what they &#8212; that they have a role in shaping history &#8212; I mean in a literal sense. &nbsp;</p>



<p>And to the Delaware Teacher of the Year, where &#8212; where were you, Jahsha?&nbsp; Where’s the Delaware Teacher of the Year?&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>I got to admit, we&#8217;re the second-smallest state, but I&#8217;m a little prejudiced on behalf of the state of Delaware.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>I know there are a lot of eighth graders at Brandywine who are feeling confident and more comfortable because of your help.&nbsp; Jill taught at the same school when she was in Delaware, at Brandywine school &#8212; high school.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And even though Teacher Appreciac- &#8212; Appreciation Week officially starts next week, I wanted to get us started earlier.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s an honor for me and the First Lady and Secretary Cardona to recognize the Teachers of the Year from 50 different states.&nbsp; And it really is something we look forward.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I had &#8212; I did a eulogy today for a brilliant woman, the former Secretary of State.&nbsp; And I sat in the front row with two other presidents who were also there to honor her.&nbsp; And I told them what I was doing.&nbsp; And they all talked about how much they enjoyed the years they were here with the Teacher of the Year event.</p>



<p>Over &#8212; over the past two years, though, the entire country has witnessed the extraordinary dedication and resolve of our nation&#8217;s teachers.</p>



<p>Early in the pandemic, teachers and teachers’ aides had to &#8212; had to do &#8212; not just be educators, you had to be tech support, you had to be moral support, you had to be &#8212; you had to be health support.&nbsp; I mean, you had to take care of your own children in addition.</p>



<p>And I watched how hard it was &#8212; how really hard.&nbsp; There was so much heroic work to help kids connect, get connected to schools, and just the socialization that they were missing in so many places for so long.&nbsp; It&#8217;s estimated they&#8217;re five to seven months behind in their education right now.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The American people saw it.&nbsp; Because guess what?&nbsp; When you&#8217;re taught remotely from home, the moms and dads understood what you were doing.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; And that &#8212; no, and they know they realized how damn hard it is.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; No, I&#8217;m serious.</p>



<p>I think it was &#8212; you know, my mother used to say, “Out of everything bad, something good will happen if you look hard enough for it.”&nbsp; I think that was the upside.&nbsp; The American people became, “Whoa.&nbsp; My goodness.”&nbsp; And they understand what you’ve been saying for years.&nbsp; That you are professionals &#8212; all of you.&nbsp; All of you have a responsibility to make sure you have what you need, and we have a responsibility to make sure we have what you need to educate our children safely so they have a chance &#8212; a chance to achieve their dreams &#8212; dreams they don’t even know they have &#8212; they don’t even know they have.</p>



<p>That’s why I made it a priority to get educators vaccinated and re-open our schools quickly.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>We made a historic commitment to our schools &#8212; $130 billion in the Rescue Plan &#8212; $130 billion.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It helped us go from 50 percent of our schools being closed to 99 percent of schools open and safe &#8212; better heating, air conditioning, and ventilation systems, safer buildings.&nbsp; It isn’t a thriving building until it comes alive, though, with teachers and students.</p>



<p>With the help of the American Rescue Plan, local governments were able to &#8212; as the state officials here can tell you &#8212; in education &#8212; were able to add a record 279,000 new educators in 2021 &#8212; two hundred and sev- &#8212; 50,000 &#8212; another 50,000 jobs &#8212; teaching jobs in the first months of 2022.</p>



<p>In January, compared to the period before the pandemic, schools have increased their number of social workers by 65 percent and counselors by 17 percent.&nbsp; You&#8217;re expected to do everything.&nbsp; You&#8217;re expected to not only teach, you&#8217;re expected to be a guidance counselor yourself, but you&#8217;re also expected to deal with the problems that they have at home.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You see it.&nbsp; You can see it in their faces when they walk into school and, as Jill said, just by the way they answer the questions &#8212; and questions about how they&#8217;re doing, how they’re feeling.&nbsp; And you need help.&nbsp; You need social workers.&nbsp; You need school psychologists and psychiatrists.&nbsp; You need that kind of help.</p>



<p>And the American Rescue Plan funds are especially important now that we see the impact that this pandemic exacted on our children.&nbsp; As I&#8217;ve said, students have lost months of learning, particularly reading and math.&nbsp; It’s not just academic skills they’ve fallen behind on, teachers are seeing young children struggle to interact in group settings, to manage conflict, to take turns.&nbsp; They’ve got a learning &#8212; a lot of learning to make up.&nbsp; And we’re doing everything we can to help you.&nbsp; I want to know &#8212; I want input from you as well, because we have a lot of teachers we seek their input.</p>



<p>Using funds from the American Rescue Plan, schools are providing and expanding summer learning &#8212; summer learning and tutoring programs to give students the extra time and attention they need to catch up and develop those fundamental math and reading skills.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You all know, if you get far behind in first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh grade, it takes a lot of time to make up.&nbsp; And if you lose your confidence, it even gets harder.</p>



<p>So, I urge more states, counties, and cities and towns to use their American Rescue Plan funding, which is in the billions of dollars, to hire more teachers, more tutors, more critical personnel in our schools.</p>



<p>Now we have an opportunity to make even more game-changing investments for educators, students, and families.</p>



<p>We’re in a competition for leading the 21st century.&nbsp; Not a joke.&nbsp; That’s what we&#8217;re &#8212; that&#8217;s where we are right now.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You know, parenthetically, if you think about it: What was the reason why we led the world &#8212; beginning around nineteen-five, -six, and -seven, and -eight?&nbsp; Because we became the first nation in the world to have universal education of 1 through 12, for everybody &#8212; no matter what, without cost.</p>



<p>Well, guess what?&nbsp; If we were sitting down today, deciding we were going to set up an education system, raise your hand if any of you think 12 years is enough in the 21st century?&nbsp; Just 12 years.&nbsp; Things are moving too rapidly.&nbsp; They&#8217;re changing exponentially.</p>



<p>And as Jill said, any country that out-educates us is going to outcompete us.&nbsp; It&#8217;s that basic.&nbsp; So, we have to build a 21st century, because the rest of the world isn’t waiting.&nbsp; We have to build for it.</p>



<p>One of the tough images of the pandemic was children sitting in their cars with their mother or dad or older brother or sister in a McDonald&#8217;s parking lot because that’s the only way they could get on Wi-Fi to do their homework.&nbsp; This is the United States of America for God&#8217;s sake.&nbsp; The United States of America.</p>



<p>If we didn’t know it before, we know now: High-speed Internet is essential.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re spending tens of billions to make sure that we have high-speed Internet available to everyone &#8212; rural America, inner-city America, suburban America &#8212; throughout every single school system in America.&nbsp; That’s part of the whole legislation we passed in terms of infrastructure.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s starting now &#8212; it&#8217;s going to create millions of jobs as well.&nbsp; For real.&nbsp; But again, we got to get in the 21st century.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve got to move.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I &#8212; the budget I proposed supports schools, supports students, and supports you.</p>



<p>The bridge &#8212; to bridge the gap between under-resourced schools and their wealthier counterparts, we&#8217;re proposing a $19 billion increase in Title I schools &#8212; the most historically neglected and underfunded schools in our nation.&nbsp; We got to get &#8212; we got to let them catch up.&nbsp; That investment would more than double the current funding of Title I schools.</p>



<p>And also &#8212; also proposing the largest increase in special education funding in two decades.&nbsp; We made the promise; we&#8217;ve never filled &#8212; fulfilled it.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve got to fulfill it.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve got to add another billion-dollar commitment with the goal of doubling the number of social workers, school counselors, and school nurses in K through 12.</p>



<p>And, by the way, thanks to the American Rescue Plan, we’re making real progress towards that goal.</p>



<p>And to support you, the educators, my budget includes $610 million to increase teacher diversity, effectiveness, and retention.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; This is key.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because all of you know that it takes time to become a teacher &#8212; the teachers you are today.&nbsp; But nearly 1 in 10 teachers leave the profession every year, with the youngest teachers being the most likely ones to leave first.&nbsp; So, we’ve got to invest in ways to keep them in the profession.</p>



<p>This year, my administration helped over 150 public servants, including teachers, get &#8212; 150,000 &#8212; get school forgive &#8212; forgiveness loans for college loans through changes we made in the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The last team kind of messed it up.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve cleared it up.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; No, but I really mean it.&nbsp; Because if you go &#8212; if you &#8212; anyway, well, I won&#8217;t go into it.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just go to that website.&nbsp; To learn how these changes can benefit you, and &#8212; I encourage you to go to StudentAid.gov, and you&#8217;re going to find you can have, in many of your cases, your entire student debt wiped out, because you are teaching and that&#8217;s considered a vital profession.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One more thing.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not enough to give teachers praise.&nbsp; We ought to give you a raise.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so &#8212; and I have to really listen to you, which I know Senator Cardona has been doing.&nbsp; And we should stand up for you.&nbsp; We should have your back.&nbsp; Teaching is one of the hardest jobs in this country to be able to do it well, and one of the most important.</p>



<p>Today, there are too many politicians trying to score political points, trying to ban books &#8212; even math books.&nbsp; I mean, did you ever think &#8212; even you younger teachers &#8212; did you ever think, when you&#8217;d be teaching, that you&#8217;d be worried about book burnings and banning books, all because it doesn&#8217;t fit somebody&#8217;s political agenda?</p>



<p>American teachers have dedicated their lives to teaching our children and lifting them up.&nbsp; We got to stop making them the target of the culture wars.&nbsp; That&#8217;s where this is going.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let me close with this, because I know &#8212; if I know anything about teachers, I know that some of you were probably grading papers on the way here.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>By the way, Jill traveled with me around the world.&nbsp; I&#8217;d say, &#8220;Jill, leave the binder.&nbsp; Leave the bag.&#8221;&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, by the way, how many are math teachers?&nbsp; Raise your hand.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She envies the hell out of you.&nbsp; She thinks your job is easier.&nbsp; You just have to check if they know the answer.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>She teaches writing.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>But she gets off the plane &#8212; am I joking? &#8212; with up to 50, 60 papers she&#8217;s grading on Air Force One.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; I mean, I said, &#8220;Jill&#8221; &#8212; she&#8217;s walking down the, you know &#8212; (laughter) &#8212; you think I&#8217;m kidding you?&nbsp; I&#8217;m not kidding with you.&nbsp; I &#8212; this is deadly earnest.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So &#8212; and many of you are trying to figure out how you&#8217;re going to &#8212; if you have class tomorrow, you may not and you may be here for the &#8212; tomorrow.&nbsp; But on Monday, are you ready for your class?&nbsp; Are you prepared?&nbsp; Do you have your lesson plan together?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because you know &#8212; look, these aren&#8217;t &#8212; we always talk about &#8220;these children.&#8221;&nbsp; They&#8217;re not someone else&#8217;s children.&nbsp; They&#8217;re our children.&nbsp; And they are the kite strings that literally lift our national ambitions aloft in a literal sense.&nbsp; Think about it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you got to do one thing to make sure the nation succeeded in the next two generations, what would you do?&nbsp; You&#8217;d want &#8212; I would say, literally, have the best-educated public in the world.&nbsp; Have our students gain confidence enough to know what they can do, to reach in.&nbsp; We have an obligation.&nbsp; We have an obligation to help them teach and reach their potential.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You&#8217;ve heard me say it many times about our children, but it&#8217;s true: They&#8217;re all our children.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And the reason you&#8217;re the Teachers of the Year is because you recognize that.&nbsp; They&#8217;re not somebody else&#8217;s children; they&#8217;re like yours when they&#8217;re in the classroom.&nbsp; You represent a profession that helps them gain the confidence &#8212; a confidence they believe they can do anything.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Again, think of your own lives.&nbsp; Think of where you gained the confidence beyond your family, God willing you&#8217;re able to.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And you know what else we&#8217;re finding out?&nbsp; We&#8217;re having a big fight about it now, but I&#8217;m going to get it done eventually, or someone will.&nbsp; And that is that we&#8217;ve learned now &#8212; you all know those who &#8212; of you in the teaching profession know that if you come from a broken home or a home that has a single parent &#8212; and there may be a drug problem or something, from a very poor home &#8212; you&#8217;re going to end up hearing a million words &#8212; fewer words spoken by the time you get to first grade than from a kid coming from an average middle-class home.&nbsp; Not different words, just words spoken, because they&#8217;re not engaged in it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And also, we learned that if, in fact, you have kids go to school at three years old and four years old and five years old, you&#8217;ll increase exponentially &#8212; by 57 percent &#8212; the likelihood that they will make it no matter what their background, all the way through 12 years of school and probably beyond.&nbsp; It matters.&nbsp; It matters.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And for so &#8212; for that and so much more that you do, you believe in these kids.&nbsp; And I know some of them are really difficult.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; I get it.&nbsp; But you believe in them.&nbsp; And you know: When they know you believe in them, they believe in you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So thank you for what you do.&nbsp; You are &#8212; if I get to have one profession that&#8217;s the best in the world &#8212; not a joke &#8212; it&#8217;s you who I want to be the best profession in the world, because you affect what this country looks like, what it&#8217;ll act like, what it&#8217;ll be like, its success or failure, more than any other group of Americans, period.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So thank you for what you do.&nbsp; Keep it going.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I promise you, Jill has your back &#8212; (laughter) &#8212; and mine.&nbsp; (Laughter.)</p>



<p>Thank you very much.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. President, how did the release just happen, given the invasion and what’s going on?</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Say again?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are you surprised Trevor Reed was released by Russia, given the invasion?</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; I did it.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How?</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; I raised it.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How though?</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; It was three months ago.</p>

<p>President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. will visit the Republic of Korea and Japan from May 20-May 24 to further deepen ties between our governments, economies, and people. This trip will advance the Biden-Harris Administration’s rock-solid commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific and to U.S. treaty alliances with the Republic of Korea and Japan. It will build on more than a year of intensive diplomacy with the Indo-Pacific, including the U.S.-ASEAN Special Summit on May 12-13 in Washington, D.C. In each country, President Biden will hold bilateral meetings with his counterparts: newly elected President Yoon Suk Yeol of the Republic of Korea and Prime Minister Kishida Fumio of Japan. The leaders will discuss opportunities to deepen our vital security relationships, enhance economic ties, and expand our close cooperation to deliver practical results. In Tokyo, President Biden will also meet with the leaders of the Quad grouping of Australia, Japan, India, and the United States. We look forward to having further details to share about this trip soon.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">James S. Brady Press Briefing Room</p>



<p>3:07 P.M. EDT<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Hi, everyone.&nbsp; Okay, I have no toppers today.&nbsp; Don’t be so disappointed.&nbsp; And I know we have a hard out for some people to gather, so we will all keep you updated on when that needs to happen.<br>&nbsp;<br>But, Zeke, why don’t you kick us off?<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; Just two quick.&nbsp; The President put out a statement this morning on the prisoner swap for the release of Trevor Reed.&nbsp; And he called it &#8212; said there were some “difficult decisions” that he had to make, involved.&nbsp; Can you just elaborate on what he meant?&nbsp; Is there a concern that this sort of arrangement incentivizes other countries to wrongfully detain Americans?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, first, let me say that it&#8217;s a huge moment today that speaks to President Biden&#8217;s commitment to bring home Americans held hostage and wrongfully detained around the world.&nbsp; And he has been clear since the beginning of this administration that he is committed to doing exactly that: to bringing Americans home.<br>&nbsp;<br>He&#8217;s brought home Americans from Venezuela, from Afghanistan, from Haiti, from Burma, and now, today, from Russia.<br>&nbsp;<br>And Trevor&#8217;s freedom is the result of months and months of hard, careful work across the U.S. government.<br>&nbsp;<br>Now I&#8217;ll get to your question.&nbsp; When he referenced the tough decision in his statement this morning, he was referencing the decision to commute the sentence of Konstantin Yaroshenko.&nbsp; I would emphasize that this individual had already served the majority of his prison sentence for a nonviolent drug crime.&nbsp; And our overriding priority here was the safe return of Trevor Reed, knowing not only had he been held against his will for too long, but that his health condition required urgent treatment.&nbsp; He&#8217;s going to be able to not only be reunited &#8212; united &#8212; reunited with his family, but to receive the treatment he needed from the United States.<br>&nbsp;<br>So, again, our objective is to bring all Americans who are detained, who are held, who are away from their families home from overseas.&nbsp; But I&#8217;m not going to be able to preview for you what processes or approaches we&#8217;re going to take for those moving forward.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And is there a concern that now it&#8217;s not just detaining Americans but wrongfully mistreating them allows &#8212; a lot of them get seriously ill &#8212; it gives other countries leverage over the United States in terms of creating another opportunity, such as this, for this sort of prisoner swap?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, again, unfortunately, Zeke, you know, there are Americans who are held in other places around the world who we are still working to bring home.&nbsp; And that has been the case long before the President and, importantly, our hostage negotiator took the steps to bring Trevor Reed home.<br>&nbsp;<br>So I &#8212; this has been going on for a long time, I guess is my &#8212; is my larger point.&nbsp; And our effort and our objective was to take steps that we needed to take to bring him home, knowing his health conditions and knowing he&#8217;s been held for too long.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And a slightly different topic: Russia yesterday effectively cutting out that &#8212; cutting off natural gas to Poland and Bulgaria.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What&#8217;s the White House response to that?&nbsp; And are there additional steps the U.S. government is taking to reassure its European allies that &#8212; maybe not so much now, but certainly when the weather turns later this year &#8212; that they will have the energy supplies they need?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; Well, unfortunately, this is not &#8212; this is the type of step, the type of almost weaponizing energy supplies that we had predicted that Russia could take in this conflict.&nbsp; That is why we, of course, have been in touch with Europe, including over the &#8212; with these countries &#8212; including over the last 24 hours, with leaders in Poland and Bulgaria.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And we have been working for some time now, for months, with partners around the world to diversify natural gas supply to Europe to &#8212; in anticipation of and to also address near-term needs and replace volumes that would otherwise come from Russia.<br>&nbsp;<br>I would note that last month, in advance of this, the President launched a task force with the EU to target additional LNG volumes for Europe, including Poland and Bulgaria.&nbsp; This will help replace, over time, Russian gas to Europe, decreasing Europe&#8217;s dependence on Russia and Putin’s ability to use energy to coerce Europe.<br>&nbsp;<br>I would also note that Poland and Polish leaders have said they have the capacity through the reserves and other imports right now, for the moment.&nbsp; And Bulgaria has said it is also looking at other import actions.<br>&nbsp;<br>So we are working and we have been working to address over the long term.&nbsp; We have been in touch with these leaders over the last 24 hours.&nbsp; And I would also note what they&#8217;ve said about what their capacities are for the current short term.<br>&nbsp;<br>Go ahead.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; Has the President been in touch with or does he plan to reach out to Paul Whelan&#8217;s family, Brittney Griner’s family, any of the other families who have loved ones detained in Russia?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We have, of course, been in touch with their families over the course of time.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not going to detail those conversations further.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Paul Whelan&#8217;s brother, David Whelan, put out a statement today.&nbsp; He said, “If this case required difficult decisions that the President doesn&#8217;t take lightly, how difficult are the decisions he faces to release Paul?”&nbsp; What&#8217;s your response to the Whelan family?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Our response is that we are going to continue to do, the President is going to continue to do, our State Department officials and negotiators are going to continue to do everything they can to bring Paul Whelan home.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I could just ask one more follow-up: The President, of course, met with Reed’s family here at the White House.&nbsp; Can you talk about the personal impact that that meeting might have had?&nbsp; Did it &#8212; did he leave that meeting with a sense of urgency &#8212; a renewed sense of urgency to get this done?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I would say the President has had a sense of urgency about bringing Americans home long before that meeting.&nbsp; Of course, he enjoyed that meeting he had with them.&nbsp; He also spoke with them on the phone when he went and traveled to Texas.&nbsp; And again, I know he was intending to reach out to them this morning as well.<br>&nbsp;<br>Go ahead.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the economy, we have a GDP print that&#8217;s coming out tomorrow that&#8217;s expected to show fairly marginal growth.&nbsp; There&#8217;s increasing expectations from banks, predictions of &#8212; that we&#8217;re entering a recession.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Your budget plan had a focus on budget deficit reduction, as opposed to fiscal stimulus.&nbsp; Is there any plan to change that as we see the threat of a recession looming?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, again, as I&#8217;ve said before on the recession question: Obviously, we look closely at economic data.&nbsp; We continue to believe that there are &#8212; there are strong data in the economy, whether it&#8217;s record job growth, whether it is the current unemployment rate.&nbsp; And that is a result of the actions of the President.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>I would note on the GDP expectations for tomorrow: As you noted, the market expectations and other analysts out there do expect the growth to be slower in quarter one, which is what the data is being reported out tomorrow, than in quarter &#8212; the fourth quarter of last year.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>This largely reflects the str- &#8212; very strong pace of growth in the fourth quarter.&nbsp; When taken together, growth over the two quarters is expected to be at a solid pace if we look at it over time, which is how we look at data.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And looking under the hood, the slowdown relative to quarter four is mainly for technical reasons like the change in inventory.&nbsp; So, last quarter, companies built up their inventories very quickly.&nbsp; And growth in inventories are expected to be slower, though still positive, this quarter.<br>&nbsp;<br>This is something that has been pointed out &#8212; or this trend or these reasoning &#8212; this reasoning, I should say, has been pointed out by a range of outside economists and forecasters, including former NEC Director Jason Furman.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A quick follow-up just on inflation: There&#8217;s been some numbers that have shown that, you know, the monthly interest payment that somebody pays when they take out a mortgage has basically doubled over the past year.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>You&#8217;ve talked about what you&#8217;re doing on meat prices.&nbsp; But if you look at the grocery bill, pretty widely there are many categories where we&#8217;re seeing double-digit inflation: flour, coffee, fruit.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Is there any strategy to deal with some of these other areas where we&#8217;re seeing, kind of, broad-based inflation?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would say the President&#8217;s plan to address inflation or address causes or costs as they&#8217;ve gone up for the American people has many different components.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Obviously, there&#8217;s an important purview that the Federal Reserve has, and they&#8217;ve indicated their plans to recalibrate.&nbsp; We support that &#8212; that effort or steps they intend to take.&nbsp; And obviously, they have purview over and they&#8217;ve predicted that inflation will come down and moderate before the end of the year.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>But how the American people experience inflation is costs, as you noted, whether it&#8217;s at the grocery store or other costs on their pocketbook.&nbsp; And the President has taken a number of steps to address costs, even extending the pause on student loans, which is something he did just a few weeks ago; the steps to fix the “family glitch” in the Affordable Care Act so more people would be eligible for lower-cost healthcare; and continuing conversations that are happening on Capitol Hill right now on his proposals to lower costs on childcare, healthcare, the cost of prescription drugs.&nbsp; These are all areas that impact and will help families as we&#8217;re working to bring costs down.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Go ahead.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The President told Trevor Reed’s family that he wanted to call them in the middle of the night last night but didn&#8217;t want to jinx the release of their son.&nbsp; Can you tell us more about what&#8217;s been happening behind closed doors for the last, you know, 12 or 24 hours regarding this release?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; And, you know, I think what the President was referring to &#8212; you know, and I&#8217;ve fortunately &#8212; because it&#8217;s a part of history and a great day, obviously, when you bring an American home, and the President has, of course, been a part of many of these in a much higher and more important role &#8212; is just &#8212; there&#8217;s a lot of sensitivity, as you all know, around the period of time when individuals are in transit &#8212; right? &#8212; when they are being brought to a third country.<br>&nbsp;<br>As we&#8217;ve noted, you know, we are very grateful to Turkey for allowing the exchange to take place in their country.&nbsp; So, basically, over the last 24 hours &#8212; one, as I noted, this &#8212; this had been happening over several months.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So, Roger Carstens, the Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs, and his team and many others have been &#8212; had been negotiating and engaging in this.&nbsp;&nbsp;And the exchange took place in Turkey during the early hours of the morning, East Coast time.&nbsp;&nbsp;So I think what the President was referring to was his understanding and knowledge that that would be happening but not wanting to put anyone in a position of putting that at risk, even people who are excited and joyful and looking forward to the news.<br>&nbsp;<br>And, you know, then once they got to Turkey and they were safely on a plane on their way back, we were able to obviously make notifications and phone calls and also put out this statement from the President to make all of you aware.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Were any other conditions agreed to for Trevor Reed&#8217;s release, besides the release of this Russian?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; This was the discussion about one issue and one topic, and that was the release of Trevor Reed.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But were there any other conditions agreed to besides releasing the Russian in exchange for Trevor Reed?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; There is no other condition.&nbsp; There were no other conditions that I’m aware of.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And what does the White House read into Russia’s willingness to release Trevor Reed now, in the middle of this invasion of Ukraine?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Look, I think the release of Trevor Reed, him returning home to his family, receiving the healthcare that he has long needed, does not change our approach or view, opposition, or the President&#8217;s intention to put forward a package in the coming days to help continue to support the Ukrainians.<br>&nbsp;<br>In terms of what they mean or how they assess it, I would leave it to them to speak to that.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But does it make anyone here at the White House more optimistic about what could be ahead, or does it have nothing to do with anything &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; This is &#8212; was about one issue and topic, and I don&#8217;t think we should read into it further.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can we go toward the back?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah, we can come to the back in a moment.&nbsp; Go ahead, Weijia.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; To follow up on MaryAlice&#8217;s question, during an interview this morning, Trevor Reed’s parents said they believed that personal meeting with the President was the, quote, “tipping point,” that it made all the difference.&nbsp; Is that true?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, look, I would say anytime that you meet with &#8212; a President meets with or any official from the government meets with the parents or family members of someone who&#8217;s being detained, that impacts them personally.<br>&nbsp;<br>But this had been negotiated &#8212; in negotiations for months.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I spoke with David Whelan today, and he is concerned that Reed’s release now narrows the chances for his brother&#8217;s release, because Russia obviously was &#8212; you know, wanted Yaroshenko’s release for years now, and now that it&#8217;s happened, he worries that that was a major concession that the U.S. no longer has.&nbsp; So what do you say to the Whelan family?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, we would say we will continue to advocate for the immediate, unconditional of Paul Whelan at every opportunity.&nbsp; And using wrongful detention as a bargaining chip represents a threat to the safety of everyone traveling, working, and living abroad.&nbsp; We obviously oppose this practice anywhere, and we are going to continue to do everything we can to bring him home.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They are thrilled, obviously, about Trevor Reed&#8217;s release, but they can&#8217;t help but have some questions about why Paul Whelan, who’s been detained in Russia longer than Trevor Reed, is not home.&nbsp; Can you explain that?&nbsp; And did Reed&#8217;s health, as you mentioned, have anything to do with it?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Obviously, our objective continues to be to bring Paul Whelan home and any American who is not with their family and is being detained overseas.&nbsp; But I&#8217;m just not going to get into more details because I want to maintain the protection of our process.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, on a separate topic: Yesterday, Dr. Jha said that people who are at high risk for developing a severe case of COVID are eligible for Paxlovid.&nbsp; And the Vice President just got her second booster shot.&nbsp; She has no symptoms.&nbsp; Can you help us understand why she&#8217;s taking it?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, he also said, which you didn&#8217;t include in your summary there, but &#8212; that you should consult with your doctor, and she consulted with her doctor.&nbsp; She has been given Paxlovid.&nbsp; That’s something many Americans may be eligible for; they should also consult with their doctor.<br>&nbsp;<br>And I think, overall, we&#8217;re just grateful that this is an approved drug on the market that many people can benefit from, including the Vice President.<br>&nbsp;<br>Okay, thank you.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go ahead in the back.&nbsp; In the way back.&nbsp; Way back.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eleven years ago, Japan had a terrible disaster and the U.S. launched a program most people have probably forgotten called Operation Tomodachi.&nbsp; Twenty-five thousand American military and ten thousand volunteers came from Japan to help.&nbsp; And one of those that came was President Biden.&nbsp; I’m wondering if on this upcoming trip he&#8217;ll be coming back to that area for a short visit.<br>&nbsp;<br>And while we&#8217;re waiting for advisement, is it possible to do an interview with you?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Oh &#8212; okay.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; You often come with an interview request.&nbsp; I should know ahead of time.<br>&nbsp;<br>I will just note I expect we will have more details on the President&#8217;s travel to Asia &#8212; something he is clearly looking forward to since he&#8217;s spoken about it publicly &#8212; soon, in the coming days.&nbsp; But in advance of that, I&#8217;m just not going to have much more to preview for all of you.<br>&nbsp;<br>Okay, go ahead.&nbsp; Go ahead &#8212; go ahead.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; Yesterday, after the Vice President announced that she tested positive, the usual people on the Internet and elsewhere who don&#8217;t like vaccines, who don&#8217;t think COVID (inaudible), immediately started with the, “Well, she would have been fine even if she hadn&#8217;t gotten the vaccine.”<br>&nbsp;<br>It seems like every time there&#8217;s a high-profile announcement that someone has gotten COVID &#8212; be it a member of Congress, AG Garland, people at the Gridiron dinner &#8212; people take it as proof that vaccines don&#8217;t work.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So, what about the White House&#8217;s messaging could be better on that, given that 234,000 Americans died?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; Well, first, I would say the truth, is &#8212; which is, I think, why you&#8217;re asking me this question &#8212; is quite the contrary.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>I mean, the Vice President is continuing to carry out her duties, as the Vice President of the United States, from home, engaging in meetings, policy discussions &#8212; I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll see her in some capacity publicly from home as well &#8212; because she is double boosted and she has taken the steps to protect herself, like we have continued to recommend other Americans do.<br>&nbsp;<br>So, I would note that while the vaccine &#8212; the reason to take the vaccine is, of course, because it can protect you from severe death &#8212; from death, from severe illness &#8212; “severe death,” that was a little intense how I said that &#8212; (laughter) &#8212; from death or severe illness, and it &#8212; by multitudes of numbers.<br>&nbsp;<br>And, you know, we&#8217;re going to continue &#8212; and if you are eligible for a booster as she was, as the President was, we recommend you get that for a second booster, because it can put you in a position where even if you get COVID, you&#8217;re able to still not &#8212; experience minimal symptoms or no symptoms, like the Vice President has been, and to continue to go about daily life the best you can while you&#8217;re quarantining.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Go ahead, Tam.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yep, thank you.&nbsp; Dr. Fauci said on the PBS NewsHour last night, quote, “This country is out of the pandemic phase of COVID.”&nbsp; What phase are we in right now?&nbsp; And also, if we are out of the pandemic phase, why are emergency measures still in place?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, what Dr. Fauci was saying is that we are in a different phase of this pandemic, and that&#8217;s absolutely true.&nbsp; Last month, the President announced a plan for how we can move forward safely while staying on our front foot against COVID.&nbsp; As he pointed out, nationwide, cases are relatively low &#8212; far below the 900,000 cases a day we saw during the Omicron surge.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Even as we&#8217;ve seen upticks, hospitalizations are about &#8212; at about the lowest level since the pandemic, and deaths are declining.&nbsp; So, there&#8217;s no question that we are in a moment &#8212; a different moment in our fight against COVID.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>But we also know COVID isn&#8217;t over and the pandemic isn&#8217;t over.&nbsp; And what Dr. Jha said yesterday also is that &#8212; different doctor, I realize, but I just want to reference him since he was just here &#8212; is that cases are low, driven by the extremely &#8212; while cases are low, cases &#8212; while cases &#8212; while low, cases are still &#8212; you know, we&#8217;ve seen an uptick in some places driven by the extremely transmissible BA.2 variant.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>We know the risk of potential sur- &#8212; surges, even as a potential new variant or subvariant remains.&nbsp; So, different phase, because we&#8217;re at a much lower level of hospitalizations, of deaths, and even, nationwide, of cases.&nbsp; But we are still seeing people get very sick from COVID and cases of COVID, and we have measures that we should all continue to take to protect ourselves.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just a couple of very quick, short other questions.&nbsp; Daleep Singh is reportedly taking a leave of absence.&nbsp; Can you confirm that &#8212; when he&#8217;ll be gone and what that means for the sanctions work that he&#8217;s doing that is very important right now?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; It is very important.&nbsp; He&#8217;s a very important member of the national security team.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have any details or any confirmation of his plans.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>What I would note, and if Daleep were here &#8212; and we’ll invite him &#8212; he would note is that he has an incredible team he works with who helps put together these sanctions package, help &#8212; packages &#8212; helps implementation, helps coordinate diplomatically.&nbsp; And we will &#8212; there are a number of people who will continue to do that work.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And when are you sending the funding request for Ukraine funding up to the Hill?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, the President said last week it will be this week.&nbsp; So, there&#8217;s only two days left of this week.&nbsp; As soon as tomorrow, but in the next two days.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Go ahead.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indonesia decided to invite President Zelenskyy to the G20.&nbsp; I&#8217;m wondering if you have a reaction to that, but also what it says about progress that the U.S. might be making behind the scenes, hoping to expel Russia from that forum, and if the decision to invite President Zelenskyy has informed and the President can confirm that he&#8217;s going to now attend the summit.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, we&#8217;ve seen the reports that President Zelenskyy has been invited to the G20.&nbsp; And we certainly welcome that.&nbsp; As you know, President Biden said just last month that Ukraine should be able to participate.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>But we don&#8217;t have further confirmation beyond the news reports, which we certainly think are positive.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>And as he also said last month &#8212; which is, of course, why you&#8217;re asking me &#8212; he doesn&#8217;t think Russia should be invited, but, ultimately, it&#8217;s a decision for the G20.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So, we don&#8217;t have any new announcements at this point.&nbsp; We will continue to engage.&nbsp; And we&#8217;ve reached out, of course, to Indonesia, as you noted, who&#8217;s hosting the summit.&nbsp; But we don&#8217;t have any other additional details.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>It&#8217;s six months away.&nbsp; Typically, the President does attend, but I don&#8217;t have anything to confirm about a trip six months away at this point.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just a quick one on Ukraine.&nbsp; There&#8217;s been questions about why the U.S. hasn&#8217;t suspended steel tariffs on Ukrainian steel coming in.&nbsp; Do you have any information about why we&#8217;ve maintained those tariffs, considering everything with (inaudible)?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure.&nbsp;&nbsp;I &#8212; obviously, there are a range of considerations to provide not only direct assistance but economic relief to the Ukrainians under consideration.&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&#8217;t have anything to preview at this point in time.&nbsp;<br><br>I&#8217;ll go to Kristen and then Jacqui, and then I&#8217;ll go to the back.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jen, thank you so much. &nbsp;Following up on Tam, we actually just reported that the White House is tomorrow &#8212; as soon as tomorrow &#8212; going to request the supplemental, and that will &#8212; it will be through the end of the fiscal year, and that it&#8217;s going to be “massive.”&nbsp;<br><br>Can you help characterize how much money will the administration be asking for?&nbsp;&nbsp;Will we hear from the President on this?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp;&nbsp;So, let me try to answer all those questions, and then tell me if I don&#8217;t.&nbsp; I can confirm “as soon as tomorrow” &#8212; only two days left in this week, but it will definitely be this week that we will send up the supplemental.<br><br>In terms of the President&#8217;s schedule, his role, I have nothing to preview at this point in time.&nbsp; As soon as anything is finalized, if he&#8217;s going to speak publicly, we will announce that to all of you or let you all know.<br><br>In terms of the length or the size, I don&#8217;t have a number for you at this point in time.&nbsp; But there is plans for this to be a proposal to go through the fiscal year.&nbsp; And it will include, as our past packages have included, security or military assistance, humanitarian, economic assistance, given those, in our view, will help address a range of the needs the Ukrainians have.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; You did answer all of my question.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Obviously, there is a renewed push on Capitol Hill and behind the scenes here at the White House for some revised version of the Build Back Better plan &#8212; a scaled-back version.<br><br>When was the last time President Biden spoke with Senator Manchin in earnest about what he could sign off on?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; So, we&#8217;re just not going to detail that, per the President&#8217;s request, from here &#8212; any conversations he has with Senator Manchin or other senators &#8212; just to protect those conversations.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fair enough.&nbsp; Can you characterize, though &#8212; are the negotiations happening in earnest?&nbsp; Are there real talks going on about specific things that Senator Manchin, that the White House could agree to?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I would &#8212; I would tell you &#8212; and I&#8217;m sure your colleagues on the Hill, now that all these senators are back, can confirm this with a number of them right now, or today &#8212; that there are still a great deal of interest, passion in moving forward with the President&#8217;s plan to lower costs for Americans and a lot of senators who would like to see this move forward.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secretary Mayorkas is getting a real grilling on Capitol Hill today, particularly about Title 42 and the plans that are in place to deal with it.&nbsp; DHS has acknowledged that a surge would put a substantial strain on resources.&nbsp;<br><br>Now, obviously, DHS announced this six-point, 20-page plan.&nbsp; But given that strain that DHS is anticipating, why should the American people have confidence that you&#8217;ll be able to deal with that surge of migrants if Title 42 is lifted?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, first, I would say, just as a reminder: It is a health authority, not an immigration plan or an immigration authority, and it&#8217;s not meant to be a replacement of.&nbsp; So the determination about where we stand and to lift it was made by the CDC.<br><br>Just to note the six-point plan that Secretary Mayorkas put out and talked about today, or over the last 24 hours, includes six pillars: surging resources, including personnel, transportation, medical support; enhancing CBP processing efficiency and moving with deliberate speed to mitigate potential overcrowding; administering consequences for unlawful entry; bolstering the capacity of nongovernmental organizations to receive noncitizens; targeting and disrupting the transnational criminal organization and smugglers; and deterring irregular migration.&nbsp;<br><br>So, what he talked about today is exactly what his preparedness plan &#8212; that&#8217;s been in the works and in the planning for months &#8212; would do.&nbsp; And they have talked about the need, potentially, for more resources to make that happen.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And just to be very clear, and some Democrats have said this: Does the plan &#8212; will the plan be in place before Title 42 is lifted?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; That is exactly what the preparedness and implementation plan is intended to do.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Go ahead, Jacqui.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; Dr. Fauci said that he&#8217;s not going to the White House Correspondents’ Dinner, citing COVID concerns.&nbsp; Obviously, he&#8217;s the President&#8217;s chief medical advisor.&nbsp; As far as we know, the President is still planning to attend.&nbsp; How should people understand Dr. Fauci’s decision versus the President&#8217;s decision?&nbsp; And is there any concern that the President would be seen as not following the science in some way?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;Well, first, I would note and respect everyone&#8217;s privacy, including Dr. Fauci’s, as much as he&#8217;s very much a public figure.&nbsp; But as you all know, he can speak for himself and his decisions.&nbsp; And every individual will make their own decisions about whether they attend this event, other events, whether they wear a mask at it or not.<br><br>Obviously, the White House Correspondents’ Association is requiring same-day testing.&nbsp; That&#8217;s a &#8212; that&#8217;s a decision they have made.&nbsp; The President outlined, as you all know, a 100-page plan in March intended to position us to go back to our more normal routines.&nbsp; But in that, that requires making risk assessments and decisions about what you&#8217;re going to do and what you&#8217;re going to attend and be a part of, as we all do every day.&nbsp;<br><br>Today, the President felt it was very important to be at and speak at the memorial service for a diplomatic icon &#8212; Secretary Madeleine Albright.&nbsp; He made the decision to do that, despite the fact that there were hundreds if not thousands of people there.&nbsp;<br><br>He has made the decision he wants to attend, in a safe way, the White House Correspondents’ Dinner to show his support &#8212; showcase his support for the free press, for the work of all of you, for the work of your colleagues around the world to not only share accurate information about COVID but also report on the war in Ukraine and all of the work that happens every single day.&nbsp;<br><br>That does stand in stark contrast to his predecessor, who not only questioned the legitimacy of the press on a nearly dai&#8211; &#8212; daily basis, but also never attended the dinner, I don&#8217;t believe.<br><br>So, he felt that was important and made a risk assessment to do that in consultation with his doctors and healthcare team.&nbsp;<br><br>I would note that we also take additional precautions and steps.&nbsp; I would expect that he may wear a mask when he&#8217;s not speaking.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll wear a mask when I&#8217;m at the dinner, in all likelihood.&nbsp; And we also took steps, including the fact that he&#8217;s not attending for the eating portion of the dinner and he&#8217;ll be there for the program, which includes a number of speakers, the presentation of scholarships, as you know, and, of course, his speaking and his roasting, where he will be “on the menu,” as he likes to say, when Trevor Noah is speaking.<br><br>So, you know, just like anything, it&#8217;s a risk assessment and a decision he made on a personal basis.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; And I want to ask a few questions on Title 42, but real quick, I want to take another stab at a question I tried yesterday.&nbsp; You answered the first part of it.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve heard the President say over and over again that he has never spoken to his son about his business dealings.&nbsp; Has he ever spoken to his son&#8217;s business partners about his son&#8217;s business dealings?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Again, nothing has changed about what I said yesterday.&nbsp; The President does not get involved in the business dealings of his son.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even through his son&#8217;s business partners?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Nothing has changed since what I said yesterday.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t believe you answered that part of my question yesterday though.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; He&#8217;s not involved in his son&#8217;s business dealings.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; On Title 42, Mayorkas detailed this six-point plan; part of it involves sending healthcare providers from the VA.&nbsp; He was asked about this on the Hill today.&nbsp; He said that it&#8217;s necessary, that this interagency effort is necessary.&nbsp; But is it appropriate to be taking resources away from the VA to help with the surge at the border?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Again, these dec- &#8212; these decisions and discussions about what resources are possible are made through the interagency process, and clearly, having support and resources for our nation&#8217;s veterans is a top priority to the President.&nbsp; But we also want to take steps we can at the border, even as we anticipate an increase in migrants coming to the border, to keep the American people safe.&nbsp; And this is part of that effort.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another piece of this plan talked about the law enforcement help.&nbsp; CBP has 23,000 agents working on the southern border right now.&nbsp; We&#8217;re already seeing 7,000 illegal crossings a day; that is expected to surge to 18,000 when Title 42 is lifted.&nbsp; So, how does adding 600 law enforcement officers make a dent in that?&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would say, Jacqui, that one of the reasons that Secretary Mayorkas is participating in the important, you know, democratic process of testifying on the Hill is to answer the questions of exactly how the resources he&#8217;s requesting, and they have identified as needing, to address this potential increase will help address that.&nbsp; So I would point you to his many hours of testimony today and tomorrow.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then there&#8217;s been reporting that Speaker Pelosi is unhappy with the way that the White House has handled Title 42 and worried that if it comes up for a vote as part of the Ukraine package, that Democrats wouldn&#8217;t have the votes to defeat that.&nbsp; Does the White House share that concern?&nbsp; And what do you make of Pelosi seeming to be kind of shaky on just how close she is with the White House on this decision?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would say we&#8217;re incredibly close with Speaker Pelosi, and the President has known her for many, many decades.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t &#8212; I don&#8217;t have more to spell out or explain what her meaning was or what “defeat it” means or doesn&#8217;t mean.&nbsp;<br><br>There are many strong feelings and points of view on Capitol Hill in the House and in the Senate about Title 42.&nbsp; It wasn&#8217;t a decision made by the White House.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a decision made to lift it by the CDC.&nbsp; The authority given to &#8212; was given to them by Congress.&nbsp;<br><br>And our effort and our focus is on implementation.&nbsp; And the Department &#8212; the Secretary of Homeland Security is obviously testifying on that.&nbsp;<br><br>So, I don&#8217;t have any more to explain about the particular comments.&nbsp; But we obviously work very closely with Speaker Pelosi on a range of issues, including immigration.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But a number of Democrats are, you know, speaking up about their problems with Title 42.&nbsp; I mean, Mark Kelly was briefed by Mayorkas yesterday.&nbsp; He said that he still has remaining questions about how and when resources are going to hit the ground.&nbsp; These are Democrats saying these things.&nbsp; They&#8217;re not wanting, you know, Title 42 to replace an immigration effort, but they&#8217;re saying that there just is not a plan in place to support what&#8217;s going to happen when Title 42 goes away.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, what I was trying to note earlier, perhaps not articulately, is that there are a range of members who have strong concerns about it being lifted.&nbsp; Again, not a decision we make &#8212; a decision made by health and science experts.&nbsp; And there are many members who feel very strongly about it actually being &#8212; it lifted and that moving forward.<br>&nbsp;<br>This is why Secretary Mayorkas is on the Hill doing, I believe, four hearings, answering extensive questions from a range of members, Democratic and Republican.&nbsp; He put out a six-pillar plan on exactly how he&#8217;s going to implement it.&nbsp; And that has been a plan that&#8217;s been in the works for six months.&nbsp; So, this is part of the democratic process happening, and he&#8217;s happy to be on the Hill answering their questions.<br>&nbsp;<br>Go ahead, Peter.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey, Jen.&nbsp; The bipartisan leadership of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senators Durbin and Grassley, have expressed concern about the DHS inspector general delaying or diminishing reports on sexual misconduct.&nbsp; This is Trump-era holdover.&nbsp; Is the President going to fire or in some way intervene with Mr. Cuffari, who is the inspector general, and is there any broader sense about what to do about Trump-era inspectors general?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I know that there can be changes made.&nbsp; I have not dug into this particular inspector general with the President or the team here.&nbsp; I&#8217;m happy to do that.&nbsp; And I can follow up with you after the briefing.<br>&nbsp;<br>Go ahead.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; On the issue of student debt, I know you&#8217;ve been asked about this before, but Senator Schumer just told reporters on the Hill that the President is getting closer to canceling up to $50,000 in student loan debt for borrowers.&nbsp; He said, &#8220;The President is moving in our direction… We&#8217;re getting closer.”&nbsp; Is that true?&nbsp; When can we expect a decision?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Look, the President has been considering and looking at options for how to provide more le- &#8212; relief to students across the country.<br>&nbsp;<br>I would note, again, that not a single borrower of federal student loans has paid a penny on these loans since he took office.&nbsp; And this has been the longest time of that for any President, probably, in history.&nbsp; You can factcheck me on that. And he&#8217;s continuing to consider a range of options in terms of any additional steps.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A follow-up on that &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Let me go to the back.&nbsp; Go ahead.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.&nbsp; Two questions.&nbsp; A follow-up on the student loan forgiveness.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You said that the President is looking at a range of options with regards to canceling some student debt.&nbsp; But is the President looking at any options for those students and parents who saved and sacrificed so that they wouldn&#8217;t have to take out such massive loans?&nbsp; Is he looking at including them in relief retroactively?&nbsp; How would they be made whole if there was<br>some sort of canceling of debt?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; You mean for people who have paid off all of their student loans?<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah &#8212; who made sacrifices so that they wouldn&#8217;t have to take out some of those loans.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; It&#8217;s a good question.&nbsp; What I can tell you at this point is that there&#8217;s legislation he&#8217;d be happy to sign for individuals who have $10,000 in existing student debt.&nbsp; If Congress wanted to send that to him, he&#8217;d be happy to sign it, and he&#8217;s looking at executive actions and authorities.&nbsp; But I don&#8217;t have anything to preview on that front.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Then, you know, if the President does move on canceling some of the student debt, isn&#8217;t that just one half of the equation though?&nbsp; I mean, what is he looking at in order to keep some of these public universities from jacking up tuition prices, despite some of the federal subsidies that they&#8217;ve been getting?&nbsp; I mean, what is it to stop some of these schools from just increasing tuition for the next generation of students?&nbsp; Isn&#8217;t that half of the equation?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know if people would consider it half of the equation.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know.&nbsp; We&#8217;ll let Americans define it.&nbsp; I would point you the Department of Education to talk about their efforts on that front.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And one last quick follow-up.&nbsp; Is the President&#8217;s weekly lunch with the Vice President still a priority for him?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Absolutely.&nbsp; Obviously, they&#8217;re not going to be dining in person while she is quarantining at home, but they did speak yesterday and I expect they will speak regularly while she is quarantining.&nbsp; And she is participating in a number of policy meetings here, too.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a follow-up.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Go ahead.&nbsp; Oh, well &#8212; and then I can come to you next.<br>&nbsp;<br>Oh, go ahead.&nbsp; So polite.&nbsp; Go ahead.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you have any reaction to Boeing claiming that it&#8217;s lost $1.1 billion on the Air Force One contract?&nbsp; And, more important, has the President ordered Boeing to stick with the traditional blue-and-white design instead of the garish red?&nbsp; (Laughter.)<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; This is bringing me back to, like, my first week in this job.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know, we gave you a year.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yes, I appreciate it.&nbsp; I actually don&#8217;t have any information on the plans for the new Air Force One.&nbsp; I can certainly check and see what we know, and I can get back to you on that.<br>&nbsp;<br>Go ahead.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; Do you know why the Vice President&#8217;s doctor recommended she take Paxlovid?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Oh, well, I think as Dr. Jha said yesterday, there are a range of Americans who may not know they&#8217;re eligible and they should consult with their doctor.&nbsp; That&#8217;s exactly what she did.&nbsp; And one of the chal &#8212; not challenges, but one of our efforts right now is to provide more information publicly and have more people consult with their doctors about whether they&#8217;re eligible.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you know if she&#8217;s, like, showing symptoms?&nbsp; Or would her getting, like, severe COVID present, like, a national security risk?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; They obviously said yesterday that she did not have any symptoms.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have any update beyond that.<br>&nbsp;<br>She&#8217;s continuing to work from home, conducting her duties as Vice President, so I don&#8217;t believe we&#8217;re talking about a national security issue in this moment.&nbsp; She can also do secure calls and video conferences from her home because we have that capacity.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But if she got severe COVID disease, would that not be a national security risk?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I&#8217;m not going to &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, Paxlovid would potentially prevent that.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I&#8217;m not going to speak to a hypothetical of the Vice President getting sicker at this point in time, which I think is probably understandable.<br>&nbsp;<br>Go ahead.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can the White House give us any update on Trevor Reed&#8217;s condition after his release or any treatments that he might have received following his release?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, you know, obviously we&#8217;re going to respect his privacy, and we spoke to his health conditions because we wanted to emphasize how important it was and the urgency of bringing him home.&nbsp; But we will, of course, leave that to him and his family to speak to and respect his health privacy beyond now.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then on the Vice President, did her role as Vice President have any impact on her receiving this treatment?&nbsp; Did that &#8212; you know, her serving as somebody who is in the line of succession, did that have any impact on her getting Paxlovid?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I think it&#8217;s important to note Paxlovid is widely available across the country through people consulting with their doctors.&nbsp; So it is not just a treatment that is available to only a small population of the public.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>In fact, what our effort is and what our focus is, at this point, is more broadly educating people on how they may be eligible for it.&nbsp; Certainly, we are grateful that this treatment is out there and available so that the Vice President, somebody who&#8217;s incredibly important in the line of succession, can take it.&nbsp; But she did it through consultations with her doctor.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Go ahead, in the middle.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; So, Democrats on the Hill today said they will act soon on efforts to lower the prices of gas and that a federal gas tax holiday is still on the table for them.&nbsp; If they give the &#8212; or if they include a federal gas tax holiday in a bill, would the President support that?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; The President has long said that he&#8217;s open to a range of options, including a federal gas tax holiday, and we&#8217;re continuing to consult with members of Congress about a range of options on lowering the price of gas.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Go ahead.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; So, on Poland and Bulgaria: Energy experts see that as sort of a warning from Russia to Germany, other countries in Europe, to pay in rubles.&nbsp; Is there a me- &#8212; and we&#8217;re also hearing that some companies in Europe are paying rubles for energy.&nbsp; Is there a message from the White House to those companies or countries that might cave and pay in rubles for energy?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t think we have a new message to offer today.&nbsp; What I would note is that we have long predicted &#8212; I mean, this is the Russian playbook; part of the Russian playbook is weaponizing energy.&nbsp; So could they do it other places?&nbsp; That certainly is possible.&nbsp; That&#8217;s one of the reasons why this taskforce was launched, at the President &#8212; that we&#8217;re working with the Europeans on, to ensure that we are diversifying access for LNG and also for oil as well for the Europeans.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, about a month ago, you announced that the U.S. was going to release 1 million barrels a day for six months.&nbsp; Oil prices &#8212; crude oil prices are still over a hundred dollars a barrel today.&nbsp; Gas prices are up.&nbsp; Is it having the intended effect?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, we&#8217;ve &#8212; we&#8217;ve said this is one tool that we can &#8212; we can utilize.&nbsp; And I know that gas prices also did come down from the beginning as a result of these actions, but we&#8217;re continuing to explore additional options.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>As we know, the oil markets are a global market, and increasing supply and continuing to work with other countries to increase supply is part of our overall objective here.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It went down only 3 cents, and we&#8217;re about 20 cents away from the record.&nbsp; So &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, again, we&#8217;re going to continue to take steps to reduce the price of gas for the American people.&nbsp; Every option &#8212; a range of options remains on the table, as is evidenced by the earlier question.&nbsp; And we know that increasing supply and ensuring supply meets the demand on the marketplace as part of that effort.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>We also watch closely for any attempt at price gouging.&nbsp; When oil prices come down, obviously gas prices should come down.&nbsp; And as you know, because we&#8217;ve had a range of charts in here, we watch that closely as well.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s something we will continue to call out.<br>&nbsp;<br>I can do like one &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; I think we have to gather in a second.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Oh, I think &#8212; okay.&nbsp; Okay, one last one.&nbsp; Last one.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Go ahead.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, can I just ask quickly: When the supplemental request comes out, either I guess tomorrow or Friday, will there be anything changing any of the COVID-related requests that are previous?&nbsp; Is the only &#8212; are the only new materials going to be related to the Ukraine request, or will there be a new &#8212; a new spate of requests on COVID assistance as well?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; So, we will request assis- &#8212; COVID funding, and we will reiterate our requests for $22.5 billion for COVID funding, something we feel will help meet the immediate emergency needs we have.&nbsp; And that was a discussion, obviously, that we didn&#8217;t get through but we will continue with Congress in the coming days and weeks.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Thanks so much, everyone.<br>&nbsp;<br>3:47 P.M. EDT</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">East Room</p>



<p>THE FIRST LADY: Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you, Secretary Cardona. And welcome to the White House. (Applause.)<br>As I was reading through your stories, I was so impressed by the innovation and creativity that all of you bring to your classrooms every day.</p>



<p>Kurt Russell, our National Teacher of the Year, helps students find a sense of self worth by dressing for success.</p>



<p>Autumn Rivera, from Colorado &#8212; (applause) &#8212; helped her students join a campaign to save a local lake.</p>



<p>Jerad Koepp &#8212; where are you? &#8212; (applause) &#8212; has helped his Native American students explore their Tribal culture and history.</p>



<p>And the stories go on and on. But I also know that what makes your work special isn’t just the projects or presentations. It’s not the curriculum or the classroom tactics. It’s that smile that you &#8212; that tells students that they don’t have to be afraid to say and answer out loud.</p>



<p>It’s the calm in your voice that can still the &#8212; you know, the wild horses running through their hearts.<br>It’s the way that you know that sometimes “I’m fine” means everything is wrong.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s how they know that you&#8217;re telling the truth when you say, “It&#8217;s okay. We&#8217;re going to figure this out together.”</p>



<p>What makes your work so special is you: the love and the joy that you bring to it, the empathy and the understanding, the sheer power of your presence.</p>



<p>You do this work because it&#8217;s a part of who you are, because you have a calling. And you&#8217;re not alone.</p>



<p>Somewhere listening is a college student who grew up teaching her younger brothers and sisters and knows that she has a gift. A young man who took an education class and something just clicked for the first time. There&#8217;s an artist who wants to spread the joy of creating something out of nothing.</p>



<p>They have a calling, too, to show students an entirely new world in science or history or art, to guide them through uncharted paths to change someone&#8217;s life forever &#8212; in big, red-letter moments and small acts of kindness.</p>



<p>To them, I want to say: Listen to that call. Join us. Yes, you &#8212; you can change the world one student at a time. And we need you. We need more teachers. (Applause.)</p>



<p>I can&#8217;t promise that it will be an easy job. Right? (Laughter.) But I can promise that it will fill your life with meaning and purpose and joy.</p>



<p>My own grandmother was a teacher in a small town in New Jersey. And she loved her work, and her students loved her in return. And just like you might see in the movies, she used to call her students to class with a big brass bell.</p>



<p>And when she died, she didn&#8217;t leave behind a giant estate, but what I inherited from her &#8212; and what I still have to this day &#8212; is that bell. And I sometimes think about the way her legacy resonated into the world like waves of sound, changing those who heard its ring.</p>



<p>I think of every student she taught and every child who she inspired, and I wonder, like, what amazing things they grew up to do. Perhaps they are public servants working to make our communities a little stronger, a little fairer.</p>



<p>Perhaps they&#8217;re doctors saving lives or architects building our cities or scientists working to solve global challenges.<br>And, of course, there&#8217;s at least one teacher.</p>



<p>Today, all of you ring your own bell, pulling each person you teach into a harmony that never ends.</p>



<p>Right now, someone out there is a better thinker because of you. Someone is standing a little taller because you helped her find the confidence that she needed.</p>



<p>Someone is working a little harder because you pushed him to try. Someone is a little kinder because you showed her what that meant. And someone is braver because you helped him find his courage.</p>



<p>Never stop ringing that bell. Never forget that, student by student, the lives &#8212; (laughs) &#8212; now I’m getting emotional &#8212; (laughter) &#8212; the lives you change go on to change the world.</p>



<p>Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause.)</p>



<p>And now I&#8217;m proud to introduce someone who has answered their call with passion, persistence, and pride: the 2022 National Teacher of the Year, Kurt Russell.</p>

<p>The Biden Administration is sounding the alarm for the urgent need for Congress to provide funding for the nation’s COVID-19 response and is underscoring the severe consequences of their inaction: Fewer vaccines, treatments, and tests for the American people, and fewer shots in arms around the world.<br><br>Over the past 15 months, the Biden Administration has used the resources Congress provided to mobilize a comprehensive COVID-19 response. As a result, the United States has made tremendous progress in our fight against the virus—saving over 2 million American lives, safely reopening our schools, creating jobs at a record pace, returning to more normal routines, and averting $900 billion in health care costs.<br><br>In March, the President laid out a comprehensive National COVID-19 Preparedness Plan to keep America moving forward safely, by ensuring that lifesaving tools like vaccines and treatments remain free and widely available to Americans, by preparing for potential surges and new variants, and by getting more shots in arms around the world. Executing this plan remains essential to sustaining the progress we have made and saving more lives. There has been an uptick in cases in parts of the country and, while cases will continue to fluctuate, this virus has proven itself to be unpredictable. Without funding, the United States will be unprepared for whatever comes next.<br><br>COVID-19 isn’t waiting on Congress to negotiate. Other countries will not wait. Time is of the essence. Congress must act urgently to help save more American lives and ensure we remain prepared.<br><br>Congressional inaction on additional COVID-19 response funding means:<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Fewer Vaccines for Americans:</span></strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>The Administration cannot secure enough booster shots for every American, if they are needed in the fall.</strong> At this moment, the United States has enough supply to support one booster shot for Americans age 12 and over, and additional boosters for immunocompromised individuals and those age 50 and older. However, if additional booster shots are authorized and recommended for the general population, we will not have the supply necessary to provide free and easy access to them for all Americans. At this time last year, the Administration was contracting for future boosters that could ultimately be needed starting in September; this allowed us to make those booster shots free and widely available as soon as they were authorized. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) needs to begin contracting for boosters imminently so that the agency can conclude contractual negotiations as soon as May to ensure delivery of sufficient supply by September. Other countries are already placing orders for future needs and as a result, will get supply before it is available for Americans. Just yesterday, Pfizer submitted an application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for Emergency Use Authorization for its booster for kids ages 5 to 11. If these boosters are authorized and recommended, we would not have enough supply for every child in that age group. Not having enough supply to support booster shots for everyone, if needed, puts American lives at risk, and is a completely avoidable outcome.</li><li><strong>The Administration cannot secure new COVID-19 vaccines to protect against multiple variants for the American people.</strong> Vaccine manufacturers are working on developing vaccines that could offer broader and longer-lasting protection than our existing vaccines—and there is ongoing discussion among scientific and medical experts, including FDA’s panel of outside experts, about the potential need for vaccines with new formulations in the future to better protect us from variants. Just this month, Moderna released data on a new vaccine that could potentially offer better protection against multiple variants. The company also announced that it expects to release data on an Omicron-specific vaccine soon. This means that there could be more effective vaccines available as soon as this fall that can enhance the protection Americans receive from getting vaccinated. The United States should be securing these vaccines today, but without funding, the Administration cannot purchase doses for the American people or even ensure that America is in line for them. This could mean people in other countries have access to the best lifesaving vaccines before Americans. Vaccines have proven to be our single-most important tool in protecting people, and the best ones should be available for the American people.</li></ul>



<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Fewer Treatments for Americans:</span></strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>The Administration cannot restock the nation’s supply of lifesaving treatments. </strong>To date, the Administration has distributed over 9.6 million courses of treatment across the country, working with states and territories, Tribes, pharmacies, federal health centers, and other partners to provide them to Americans for free. Due to a lack of funding, we have already missed the opportunity to purchase additional supply of these lifesaving treatments. To stretch our supply as much as possible, last month, the Administration was forced to cut the number of monoclonal antibody treatments distributed to states by over 30 percent. Ensuring these treatments remain free, widely available, and easy to access for people who need them is crucial to our nation moving forward safely.</li><li><strong>The Administration cannot invest in promising treatments or secure newer, even better treatments for the American people. </strong>The federal government will not be able to invest in next-generation treatments that have the potential to provide broader protection against future variants or to treat people who may not be able to take full advantage of current treatments. Several candidates may be promising, and the United States will lose an opportunity to secure its spot in line and to support ramped-up manufacturing capacity of these treatments if we do not have funding to secure supply prior to a potential authorization or approval. Given COVID-19’s potential to mutate, it is also prudent to support and secure a range of effective treatments that attack the virus in different ways to guard against future variants.</li><li><strong>The Administration will have to scale back purchases of treatments that protect immunocompromised Americans. </strong>The Administration has secured more than 1 million courses of Evusheld, a preventive therapy for immunocompromised people. Due to lack of funding, we have had to substantially scale back our plans to purchase additional supply. This therapy takes months to produce, and at this point, we are at risk of missing out on supply that will be delivered in the last few months of 2022. Congressional inaction will put immunocompromised individuals at greater risk as we enter this fall.</li></ul>



<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Fewer Tests for Americans:</span></strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>The Administration cannot sustain domestic testing manufacturing capacity and will be unprepared for another surge in testing demand.</strong> Omicron drove unprecedented demand for COVID-19 testing around the world. As cases have fallen dramatically, so has demand for testing. Demand will continue to decrease over time, and as a result, domestic manufacturers will start ramping down production across the next several weeks and months. Federal investments are a crucial way to preserve the domestic testing manufacturing capacity we have built over the last 15 months. Without these investments, it will take manufacturers months to ramp back up to rebuild capacity, so failure to invest now will leave us with insufficient testing capacity and supply if we see another surge in cases and demand for testing increases once again. This would mean empty store shelves, long lines at testing sites, and slower results which will have life-or-death consequences for people who need to take lifesaving treatments within days of becoming symptomatic. That should not be allowed to happen.</li></ul>



<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Fewer Shots in Arms Around the World:</span></strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>The United States cannot supercharge our effort to get more shots in arms, putting us at greater risk for more variants that may prove to be even more dangerous than the ones we have faced to date.</strong> The U.S. has now delivered over half a billion adult vaccines to 114 countries. Countries need funding and assistance to turn vaccines into vaccinations. Without additional funding for our global response, we will not have resources to help get more shots in arms in countries in need—which is one of the best ways we can prevent future variants. We will also lack funding to provide oxygen and other lifesaving supplies, and our global genomic sequencing capabilities will fall off—undermining our ability to detect any emerging variants around the world.</li></ul>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Washington National Cathedral<br>Washington, D.C.</p>



<p>11:33 A.M. EDT<br> <br>THE PRESIDENT:  Freedom endures against all odds in the face of every aggressor because there are always those who will fight for that freedom.<br> <br>And in the 20th and 21st century, freedom had no greater champion than Madeleine Korbel Albright.<br> <br>Anne, Alice, Katie &#8212; your mom was a force &#8212; a force of nature.  With her goodness and grace, her humanity, and her intellect, she turned the tide of history.<br> <br>David, Daniel, Jack, Jake, Ben, and Ellie &#8212; you’re too young to remember this, but when the Iron Curtain fell and the Berlin Wall came down, our world faced one of those inflection points &#8212; a once-in-a-generation moment of upheaval but opportunity as well.<br> <br>People and nations around the world were deciding the future they wanted to make for themselves.  And your grandmother &#8212; your grandmother &#8212; as Madam Ambassador and as the first female Secretary of State in American history, made sure those nations and those people knew exactly where the United States of America stood &#8212; and what we stood for.<br> <br>You know, and all through it, her beloved sister Kathy and her brother John can attest, she never forgot where she came from or who she was.<br> <br>President Obama, President and Secretary Clinton, Vice President Al Gore, members of Congress, Cabinet members past and present: Today, we honor a truly proud American who made all of us prouder to be Americans.<br> <br>I also want to welcome the distinguished guests and dignitaries who have traveled from around the world to celebrate a daughter of the Czech Republic who knew &#8212; who knew what it meant to endure war and flee persecution.<br> <br>With her friend Vaclav Havel &#8212; when he died, I remember, when Madeleine eulogized him, she used these words, and I quote, “He cast light into places of deepest darkness and reminded us constantly of our obligations to one another.”<br>    <br>These words &#8212; these words apply equally to Madeleine.<br> <br>When I got word that Madeleine had passed, I was in mid-air on my way to Europe to meet with our NATO Allies in Brussels to help try to continue to keep the &#8212; the strong, strong alliances together &#8212; our organization and international response to Russia’s brutal and unjustifiable war against Ukraine.<br> <br>And it was not lost on me that Madeleine was a big part of the reason NATO was still strong and galvanized, as it is today.<br> <br>And a few days later, I traveled to Poland and spoke about all that is at stake in our world and for democracy and freedom &#8212; which is under assault from forces of autocracy and oppression.</p>



<p>Many are tired of hearing me say I think we’re at another inflection point in world history, where there is literally a severe contra- &#8212; confrontation between autocrats and democratic nations.<br>&nbsp;<br>President Clinton &#8212; Bill, it was not lost on me that you spoke at the same Warsaw Castle that I was about to speak at 25 years earlier.<br>&nbsp;<br>In my case, it was evening.&nbsp; The interior of the castle &#8212; a beautiful courtyard &#8212; holds about 5-, 600 people.&nbsp; And mostly Poles and Ukrainians were present when I spoke.&nbsp; And I’m sure many in the audience spoke English, though likely not their first language.<br>&nbsp;<br>But when I mentioned the name &#8212; they were respectful of what I was saying &#8212; but when I mentioned the name of Madeleine Albright, there was a deafening cheer.&nbsp; They all stopped everything and started to cheer.&nbsp; It was spontaneous.&nbsp; It was real.&nbsp; For her name is still synonymous with America as a force for good in the world.<br>&nbsp;<br>Madeleine never minced words or wasted time when she saw something that needed fixing or someone who needed helping.&nbsp; She just got to work.<br>&nbsp;<br>And as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee from the time I was a kid &#8212; God, they were the good old days.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; I &#8212; I was the chairman or the ranking member for a good part of that time.&nbsp; And in the ‘90s, I can attest that Madeleine, with the significant help of the President of the United States, kept the committee really busy.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>In our work to halt genocide in the Balkans, support new democracies in Eastern and Central Europe, to develop Plan Colombia &#8212; in all of those undertakings, Madeleine was an incomparable ally and advisor beyond the President to me and to others on the committee.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>She always had a knack for explaining to the American people why it mattered to them that people everywhere in the world were struggling to breathe free.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And Madeleine didn’t stop when she left government.&nbsp; For decades, she was a nexus of the foreign policy community, always &#8212; and I mean always &#8212; on top of the latest developments, always speaking out for democracy, and always the first to sound the alarm about fascism.<br>&nbsp;<br>Presidents and leaders around the world continued to solicit her advice, including me.&nbsp; When I asked her last year to chair the Defense Policy Board, she built businesses.&nbsp; She pumped out New York Times bestsellers that were both highly prescient and deeply salient &#8212; and constantly bestsellers.&nbsp; I think I’ve read them all.<br>&nbsp;<br>You know, and she &#8212; and she mentored generations of rising foreign policy experts &#8212; the, quote, “foreign policy establishment.”<br>&nbsp;<br>You know &#8212; and the thing that I noted that was deliberate and remarkable about her &#8212; not unlike Secretary Clinton &#8212; was that she made sure that young women knew they belonged at every single table having to do with national security, without exception.<br>&nbsp;<br>Today, across our government and around the world, Madeleine’s protégés are legion.&nbsp; Many are here today, each carrying within them a spark lit by her passion and her brilliance.<br>&nbsp;<br>I think part of the reason why Madeleine was such a successful diplomat was that she understood something I’ve always believed.&nbsp; And my boss, President Obama, when I was Vice President, used to kid me because I’d repeat so often, because I believed she understood something I’ve always believed: that all politics, especially international politics, is personal.&nbsp; It all, ultimately, is personal.<br>&nbsp;<br>She could go toe to toe with the toughest dictators, then turn around and literally teach a fellow ambassador how to do the macarena on the floor of the U.N. Security Council.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; You all think I’m kidding.&nbsp; I’m not kidding.</p>



<p>She thought it was too difficult to teach me how to dance, though.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; She was right.<br>&nbsp;<br>No matter where she was, she understood people.&nbsp; She cared about people.&nbsp; And all of that was grounded in an education gained by watching her father, Josef Korbel &#8212; and her mentor as well.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>She learned diplomacy at the dinner table.&nbsp; And throughout her life, nothing mattered to Madeleine more than the family &#8212; nothing.<br>&nbsp;<br>Madeleine had the same rule that I do and others here do: No matter what’s happening in my day &#8212; as President Obama can tell you &#8212; or who I’m meeting with, if one of my children calls, I take the call.&nbsp; She was the same way.<br>&nbsp;<br>Anne, Alice, Katie, and her grandchildren &#8212; each of you &#8212; each of you is literally a tribute to her enormous &#8212; to her enormous capacity to love.<br>&nbsp;<br>I know it’s hard, but I promise you: She’s always with you &#8212; in your mind, in your heart, and part of your soul.&nbsp; And I promise you: You’re going to have a tough decision, and you’re going to be asking yourself, “What would she want me to do?”&nbsp; Not a joke.&nbsp; Remember I said it.&nbsp; That’s going to happen.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And, Kathy and John, the connection the three of you maintained through your lives was always an anchor to Madeleine<br>through all the ups and downs of life.&nbsp; What a gift.&nbsp; What a gift.&nbsp; What a family.<br>&nbsp;<br>You know, from that first trans-Atlantic crossing on the SS America, to landing in nations around the world in that big blue-and-white plane emblazoned with the words “United States of America,” Madeleine understood her story was America’s story.&nbsp; Her story was America’s story.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>She loved to speak about America as the “indispensable nation.”&nbsp; To her, the phrase was never a statement of arrogance.&nbsp; It was about gratitude for all this country made possible for her.&nbsp; It was a testament to her belief in the endless possibilities that only America could help unlock around the world and to her understanding of what American power could achieve when it was united with and motivated by enduring American values.<br>&nbsp;<br>That’s why there was nothing she loved more than swearing in new citizens to this great nation of ours.&nbsp; She’d light up, reminding them that she had once stood where they stood.<br>&nbsp;<br>Having gained the blessings of liberty, she wanted nothing more than to share them around the globe.<br>&nbsp;<br>To Madeleine, from my prospective, there was no higher mission, no greater honor than to serve this great experiment in freedom known as the United States of America.<br>&nbsp;<br>May her memory continue to be a blessing to our nation, and may we remember her words and her deeds.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>May she always be a light to all those in the darkest places &#8212; a reminder of our obligation to one another.<br>&nbsp;<br>May God bless Madeleine Albright.<br>&nbsp;<br>11:47 A.M. EDT</p>

<p>Throughout America&#8217;s history, workers have sacrificed to grow our food, build our roads, transport our goods, provide care for our neighbors and families, and manufacture the products that are the envy of the world.&nbsp; Our strength and resilience as a Nation is due in no small measure to the strength and resilience of our workers. &nbsp;However, each year, millions of workers get injured or sick doing the work that provides for their families and supports all of ours. &nbsp;Tragically, thousands of workers are killed by preventable workplace accidents and illnesses. &nbsp;The dangers have never been more apparent than during the past 2 years of the pandemic.&nbsp; No worker should risk avoidable injury, illness, or even death in the course of doing their job. &nbsp;Ensuring worker safety is a national priority and a moral imperative. &nbsp;On this Workers Memorial Day, we honor and remember those who lost their lives on the job and reaffirm every worker&#8217;s basic right to a safe and healthy workplace.<br><br>From my first day in office, I have made a priority of building our economy back stronger and empowering and protecting America&#8217;s workers. &nbsp;These priorities are inextricably linked. &nbsp;A stronger economy built from the bottom up and the middle out puts greater power in workers&#8217; hands to improve their lives, provide for their families, and choose higher quality, higher paying, and safer jobs. &nbsp;Greater worker power means that workers have a stronger voice in their workplace, enabling them to advocate for safer working conditions. &nbsp;It also means workers secure a greater share of the economic success they create, which strengthens and expands America&#8217;s middle class &#8212; the backbone of our Nation and our economy.&nbsp;<br><br>Today, workers across the country are beginning the long overdue work of rebuilding our Nation&#8217;s roads and bridges, ports and waterways, public transit and passenger rail systems, and water and sewer lines while expanding electric vehicle charging station networks and broadband internet access in every community.&nbsp; In the coming years, millions of workers will be engaged in those efforts. &nbsp;The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will create new jobs and modernize cities, small towns, and rural and Tribal communities across the country. &nbsp;And we are living up to our commitment that infrastructure jobs will be available to people of all races, genders, and backgrounds in every part of the country.&nbsp; We are committed to ensuring these jobs are safe and subject to high labor standards, including good wages, strong safety and health protections, and the free and fair choice to join or organize a union and collectively bargain with an employer. &nbsp;Through decades of organizing, negotiating, picketing, and protesting, labor unions secured vital workplace protections that union and non-union workers rely on today, and we are working to strengthen both unions and the workplace protections they provide.<br><br>On Workers Memorial Day, we mourn every worker who was lost on the job or from exposure to workplace hazards and join their families and everyone who loved and cared for them in turning pain into purpose.&nbsp; Their memories command us to continue our work toward a future in which no one has to risk their life for a paycheck.&nbsp; We honor the memories of the lives tragically taken from us and remain committed to safeguarding the health and safety of all workers.<br><br>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 28, 2022, as Workers Memorial Day. &nbsp;I call upon all Americans to observe this day with appropriate service, community, and education programs and ceremonies in memory of those killed or injured due to unsafe working conditions.<br><br>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-seventh day of April, in the year of our Lord two&nbsp;thousand&nbsp;twenty-two, and of the Independence of the United&nbsp;States of&nbsp;America the two&nbsp;hundred and forty-sixth.<br>&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-right">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.</p>
