										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>As our Nation recovers and our economy continues its historic growth following a global pandemic, it is important that consumers are fully informed about their rights and the potential risks in the marketplace.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hardworking American families deserve to feel secure in the knowledge that, as we&nbsp;build back better, we are building an economy based on principles of fairness, privacy, and equity.&nbsp;&nbsp;During National Consumer Protection Week, we recommit ourselves to those basic rights, to protecting consumers, to raising awareness about bad&nbsp;actors and deceptive practices in the marketplace, and to empowering people to make informed financial decisions so that&nbsp;our economy works for everyone.</p>



<p>My Administration has zero tolerance for criminals who steal Americans&#8217; hard-earned dollars or abuse their personal information.  Particularly in moments of crisis, like this pandemic, unscrupulous individuals have tried to take advantage of struggling Americans by price gouging, stealing money, harvesting personal information, and offering false hope for economic assistance, jobs, treatments, and cures.  We are committed to halting these practices and protecting all consumers, including small businesses and gig workers, from fraud and unlawful business practices.  Our Nation&#8217;s consumer protection agencies &#8212; including the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and Consumer Product Safety Commission &#8212; work with the Department of Justice and law enforcement agencies nationwide to fight fraud, predatory practices, and data exploitation by abusers large and small.  These agencies work every day to protect consumers and ensure product safety through investigations, law enforcement actions, and free, actionable, plain-language consumer education resources.</p>



<p>Abusive practices have an especially harmful impact on communities of color, who are often targeted by bad actors.  A report from the FTC &#8212; <em>Serving Communities of Color</em> &#8212; found that people living in majority-Black and Latino communities were more likely to experience problems with credit bureaus, banks and lenders, and used car issues than those living in majority-white communities.  That is why my Administration is reviving the Government&#8217;s top consumer watchdog, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, to address racial disparities in access to loans, capital, and credit, while protecting consumers in historically underserved communities. </p>



<p>As a Nation, let us work together to create an environment that protects and educates American consumers and communities.  This National Consumer Protection Week, and all year long, my Administration is committed to ensuring that every American has access to information that can help protect themselves and their communities.  To learn more about these resources, please visit <a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/features/national-consumer-protection-week">consumer.ftc.gov</a>.  To learn how to get involved with National Consumer Protection Week, you can visit <a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/features/national-consumer-protection-week">ftc.gov/ncpw</a>. </p>



<p>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 6, 2022, through March 12, 2022, as National Consumer Protection Week.  I call upon government officials, industry leaders, and advocates across the Nation to share information about consumer protection and provide our citizens with information about their rights as consumers.     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourth day of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-sixth.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-right">JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.</p>

<p>Last night, the Florida Senate passed House Bill 5, which effectively bans access to abortions after 15 weeks. This bill is extreme by any standard.  <br><br>The right of women to make decisions about their own bodies is non-negotiable. If signed into law, Florida’s bill would violate the constitutional right to abortion that the Supreme Court has recognized for nearly 50 years. It will block access to crucial reproductive health care for Floridians, with a particular impact on low-income communities, communities of color, and rural communities.<br><br>Unconstitutional abortion bans and other bills that will dramatically reduce access to reproductive care are pending in state legislatures across the country. These efforts only strengthen our resolve: The Biden-Harris Administration will continue to do everything in our power to protect access to healthcare and defend a woman’s right to make decisions about her body and determine her future.<br></p>

<p>Today’s report shows that my plan to build an economy from the bottom up and the middle out is working to get America back to work.&nbsp;Since I took office, the economy has created 7.4 million jobs. That’s 7.4 million jobs providing families with dignity and a little more breathing room. We are building a better America.<br><br>In February, the economy created 678,000 jobs, following the greatest year of job growth in American history and the fastest economic growth in almost 40 years. The unemployment rate ticked down to 3.8 percent. And, at the same time, more people are rejoining the labor force and finding jobs as we recover from the pandemic. And&nbsp;people went back to work in February across a wide ranges of industries—with jobs gained in leisure and hospitality, construction, retail, and manufacturing. In fact,&nbsp;last year has been the best year for manufacturing jobs and trucking jobs since 1994. We are making more and moving goods faster in America.<br><br>This progress is the result of the new economic approach I talked about in the State of the Union—grow the economy from the bottom up and middle out. And it’s a result of our success combatting COVID-19 and moving forward safely. While we must tackle head on the challenge families are facing with rising costs, today’s report underscores that the United States is uniquely well positioned to deal with the challenge that inflation has posed across the world as we recover from the pandemic.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Investments in U.S. Manufacturing, Historic Buy American Update Fuel a Recovery That Is Made in America</em></p>



<p>Since his first day in office, President Biden relentlessly focused on an industrial strategy to revitalize our manufacturing base, strengthen critical supply chains, and position U.S. workers and businesses to compete and lead globally in the 21<sup>st</sup> century. This whole-of-government effort is leading to an historic recovery in domestic manufacturing—since President Biden took office, the economy added <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MANEMP">375,000 manufacturing jobs</a> – the most in nearly 30 years. The U.S. economy grew at the fastest pace in nearly 40 years in 2021, and manufacturing as a share of U.S. GDP has <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/VAPGDPMA#0">returned to pre-pandemic levels</a>.<br><br>The Biden-Harris <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/commentary/transcript/brian-deese-on-bidens-vision-for-a-twenty-first-century-american-industrial-strategy/">21<sup>st</sup> Century industrial strategy</a>, Made in America policies, and transformational investments such as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law have catalyzed historic domestic investments by the private sector to bring good-paying manufacturing jobs back home. This includes nearly $80 billion in planned investments in semiconductor manufacturing and more than $100 billion in announced investments in electric vehicles, batteries, and critical minerals since 2021.<br><br>Echoing President Biden’s call in this week’s State of the Union speech, Congress must build on this historic progress by passing the Bipartisan Innovation Act. This legislation will make record investments in emerging technologies, critical supply chains, and American manufacturing to level the playing field for American workers and businesses and outcompete China and the rest of the world in the 21<sup>st</sup> Century.<br><br><strong>Today, President Biden and Barbara Humpton, President and CEO of Siemens USA, will announce that Siemens will invest $54 million in expanded domestic production and create 300 jobs manufacturing critical electrical infrastructure that supports everything from electric vehicle chargers to data centers to industrial sites.</strong><br><br><strong>Lonnie Stephenson, International President of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) will also speak to how the Biden-Harris Administration’s Made in America policies support good-paying, union jobs across the country.</strong><br><br><strong>This builds on announcements from major companies bringing production back home:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Intel announced a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/01/20/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-bringing-semiconductor-manufacturing-back-to-america/">$20 billion</a> semiconductor manufacturing fab outside Columbus, Ohio that will create 7,000 construction jobs and another 3,000 permanent jobs.<br></li><li>General Motors announced its largest-ever <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/01/25/statement-by-president-biden-on-general-motors-investment-in-michigan/">$7 billion</a> investment to create 4,000 new EV manufacturing jobs at sites across Michigan.<br></li><li>Boeing and the Qatar Airways Group announced a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/01/31/readout-of-president-bidens-meeting-with-amir-sheikh-tamim-bin-hamad-al-thani-of-qatar/">$20 billion</a> deal, including $6.8 billion to supply aircraft that will support tens of thousands of U.S. manufacturing jobs.<br></li><li>MP Materials, who operate the only rare earth mine in the U.S., announced a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/02/22/fact-sheet-securing-a-made-in-america-supply-chain-for-critical-minerals/">$700 million</a> investment to establish a fully domestic end-to-end supply chain for permanent magnets by 2025, which are used in electric vehicle motors, wind turbines, and defense systems.</li></ul>



<p><strong>President Biden will also announce the most robust updates to the implementation of the Buy American Act in nearly 70 years to ensure taxpayer dollars create good-paying jobs here at home, strengthen critical supply chains, and position U.S. businesses to compete in strategic industries.</strong><br><br>The Federal government spends more than $600 billion each year buying goods and services.<br><br>President Biden believes that when taxpayers foot the bill, that spending should invest in American workers, manufacturers, and small businesses. In his first week in office, he signed <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/25/executive-order-on-ensuring-the-future-is-made-in-all-of-america-by-all-of-americas-workers/">Executive Order 1400</a>5, <em>Ensuring the Future Is Made in All of America by All of America&#8217;s Workers</em>, initiating a review of Buy American policy and establishing the first-ever Made in America Office in the Office of Management and Budget.<br><br>Since January 2021, the Made in America Office, codified by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, has already helped agencies implement Made in America requirements, launched a new website designed to provide transparency into exceptions from Made in America laws, and created a new Made in America Council to ensure we identify the best ideas and practices from across the Federal government to implement Made in America initiatives. The actions to date implement a whole-of-government agenda designed to maximize the use of taxpayer dollars on domestic products and services, strengthen our industrial base, and create good-paying, union jobs for Americans.<br><br>This rule is also consistent with international trade laws and will bring the U.S. in line with the domestic procurement practices of peer countries. It will allow the U.S. to use its purchasing power to seed and grow new and strategic industries, while continuing our work with allies and partners to diversify and strengthen international supply chains to mitigate the global disruptions we’ve seen from COVID-19, climate change, and geopolitical conflict. &nbsp;<br><br><strong>Today’s final rule will deliver on President Biden’s commitment to “Make Buy American Real” by:</strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>Raising the domestic content threshold to 75 percent.</strong>&nbsp;Today, products qualify as Made in America for federal procurement if 55 percent of the value of their component parts are manufactured here. This final rule will increase that threshold to 60 percent this year, 65 percent in 2024, and 75 percent in 2029. This will close loopholes in the current regulation while allowing businesses to onshore manufacturing and adjust their supply chains to increase the use of American-made components. This change will create more opportunities for small- and medium-sized manufacturers and their employees, including small and disadvantaged enterprises, from all parts of the country.<br><br>To support this work, the Small Business Administration has created a new manufacturing office in its federal contracting division and agencies will work with the Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership to find and develop American sources for government needs.<br></li><li><strong>Strengthening domestic supply chains for critical goods with new price preferences.</strong>&nbsp;When President Biden took office, he signed an executive order to fortify our critical supply chains. Building off the release of the first-of-their-kind one-year industrial base reviews last week, this rule creates a framework to allow the government to apply enhanced price preferences to select critical products and components identified in a subsequent rulemaking. These preferences, once in place, will support the development and expansion of domestic supply chains for critical products by providing a source of stable demand for domestically-produced critical products.</li></ul>



<p><strong>The President’s Made in America policies are already supporting U.S. manufacturing, including small businesses, minority-owned businesses, and woman-owned businesses.</strong><br><br>Last year, the Biden-Harris Administration announced <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/12/02/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-reforms-to-increase-equity-and-level-the-playing-field-for-underserved-small-business-owners/">new reforms</a> to increase equity in Federal procurement, including increasing goals for Federal procurement, increasing transparency, and supporting new entrants to the Federal marketplace.<br><br><strong>In just the last year:</strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>American Fashion Network</strong>, a U.S.-based SBA certified woman-owned small business, pivoted from strictly commercial work to manufacturing masks for the government during COVID.

After winning their first federal contract to make millions of Made in America PPE, they later won multiple contracts with the Defense Logistics Agency to produce coats for the U.S. Air Force, Coast Guard,&nbsp;Navy, and Military District of Washington. Their apparel is manufactured in New York City’s Garment District, where they employ over 100 workers who are SEIU-affiliated Workers United Union members. In 2022, the family hopes to add 150 new manufacturing jobs in their newly&nbsp;built factory in Queens,&nbsp;New York City.<br></li><li><strong>Brothers Body and Equipment</strong>, a service-disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB) and a HUBZone certified company operates a 30,000-square foot manufacturing facility in Galion, OH. It is executing on more than $300,000 in contracts to produce equipment for the Departments of Veterans Affairs and the Army, allowing the 12-person firm to keep its doors open and recover from a 90% revenue decrease in 2021 as a result of COVID.<br></li><li><strong>Garrett Container Systems </strong>in Accident, Maryland manufactures aluminum storage and shipping containers. Awarded more than $500,000 in contracts for the Department of the Navy and the Defense Logistics Agency, the HUBZone-located business now expects to increase its workforce to more than 120 workers to deliver on contracts through FY23.<br></li><li><strong>Alkegen</strong>, a manufacturer of meltblown fiber filtration media (the critical component in NIOSH N95 respirators), recently completed expansion of its plant in Rochester, New Hampshire where its 125 employees manufacture Berry-compliant (100% Made in America) components for NIOSH N95 and surgical masks.
