<p class="has-text-align-center">East Room</p>



<p>2:09 P.M. EDT<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Please, thank you.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Thank you, thank you.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; I should be clapping for all of you.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zahara, do I have permission to proceed?<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All right.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, first of all, as I was standing there listening, I should say that &#8212; thank all of you, everyone in this room.&nbsp; We didn&#8217;t change the law; we set out &#8212; I remember some of you way back when I first wrote this legislation &#8212; to change the culture &#8212; to change the culture.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; For real.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So it&#8217;s great to be with you all.&nbsp; And, Ruth, it’s been an honor to stand with you through these years.&nbsp; And she was a serious victim of violence &#8212; left for dead, basically &#8212; before this law was written.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And you make me think of the women who were willing to come and testify before the whole world when I first started those hearings.&nbsp; It wasn&#8217;t viewed, even among the advocacy groups, as necessarily a particularly positive thing to do.&nbsp; It was &#8212; because &#8212; anyway, you know.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you for your courage, for being a hero, sharing your powerful voice, and standing up for thousands of women.&nbsp; And that could be said about most of you in this room.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to thank the members of the Senate and the House, members of my Cabinet for all you&#8217;ve done.&nbsp; The idea that this took five years to reauthorize &#8212; I was out of office those years. &#8212; (laughter and applause) &#8212; and it drove me crazy.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No, I &#8212; that&#8217;s not why it didn&#8217;t happen, but it drove me crazy.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; It drove me crazy, the rationale for why we weren&#8217;t &#8212; anyway.&nbsp; I won&#8217;t get into that.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; I know some of you think maybe I should be out of office for another four years.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the point is, it’s wonderful to see so many brave survivors and dedicated advocates and &#8212; and, truly, old friends &#8212; so many who have worked so hard to modernize the Violence Against Women Act to make it stronger and make sure that it endures.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the reason we’ve been able to do so much, make so much progress in the past 20 years is because of all of you.&nbsp; And I know some of you aren&#8217;t even 28 years old, so it doesn&#8217;t count for you guys.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; But all kidding aside, it really does &#8212; again, I keep coming back to you &#8212; you changed the culture, not just the law.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I want to thank the bipartisan members of Congress who helped get this latest reauthorization done.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Dianne &#8212; Dianne Feinstein, Joni Ernst, Lisa Murkowski.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And in the House &#8212; in the House of Representatives, nobody worked harder than Sheila Jackson Lee, and &#8212; and I thank you.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; I learned a long time ago: When Sheila wants something, just say yes.&nbsp; It saves time.&nbsp; (Laughter.)<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And Jerry Nadler, a great friend and a great congressman.&nbsp; And Brian Fitzpatrick &#8212; Brian, thank you.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Look, thank you for coming together and never giving up.&nbsp; You know, the fact is that it really wasn’t so long ago this country didn&#8217;t want to talk about violence against women, let alone as being a national epidemic, something the government had to address.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a society, we literally looked away.&nbsp; We looked away.&nbsp; In many places, it wasn’t a crime.&nbsp; And I don&#8217;t recall &#8212; I don&#8217;t recall how many times I was told in the prelude to writing the legislation that it&#8217;s a &#8220;family affair.&#8221;&nbsp; &#8220;You don&#8217;t understand, Biden.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a family affair.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I began, along with others, to pursue this legislation to change this &#8212; this issue, we were told that we would literally be responsible for the &#8220;disintegration&#8221; of American families in the major press.&nbsp; It wasn&#8217;t just the wackos; it was in the mainstream press.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And we talked about creating shelters to give survivors a way out because so many don&#8217;t have a way out, and their children &#8212; by the way, the vast majority of children on the street with their mothers are there because she&#8217;s a victim of domestic violence.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And here&#8217;s what they said, here&#8217;s what they wrote: They said these shelters &#8212; providing shelter was nothing more than &#8220;indoctrination centers&#8221; for women&#8217;s liberation issues.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No, I can get you the articles.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a fact.&nbsp; Not a joke.&nbsp; Not a joke.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And calling the police meant having to stand in front of your abuser &#8212; your significant other, your husband, whomever &#8212; and say, &#8220;He did it.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I used to say, when I&#8217;d get heat on this, when I spoke &#8212; I remember making a speech to the Chamber of Commerce, and someone said, &#8220;Well, you&#8217;re going overboard here.&#8221;&nbsp; I said, &#8220;Let me ask you, Jack.&#8221;&nbsp; I said, &#8220;If you had a 320-pound guy who could bench 400 pounds standing in front of you and beat the &#8212; smacked you, are you going to say he did it?&nbsp; Because you know he&#8217;s going to come back.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking, few &#8212; there were very few police departments that had trained personnel.&nbsp; I mean very few.&nbsp; I &#8212; I&#8217;m sure there were some, I just can&#8217;t remember any of them.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; No, I really mean it.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And as a matter of fact, I can’t &#8212; I don&#8217;t think there were any Special Victims Units in most of the police departments around the country before this legislation was written.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now there&#8217;s programs that are on TV for the last 25, 30 years.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; No, but I really mean it.&nbsp; It mattered.&nbsp; That&#8217;s what I mean about changing the culture.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Look, and there were too few places you could go for advice or for help.&nbsp; Where would you go?&nbsp; And how many times &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I remember the biggest fights I had were the second time around with universities &#8212; with universities.&nbsp; Where do you show up?&nbsp; Where do you report this?&nbsp; &#8220;Well, we don&#8217;t want to…&#8221;&nbsp; I mean major universities &#8212; not Podunk universities.&nbsp; Major universities.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It took time to change the culture, and you did it.&nbsp; You did it.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was no national hotline.&nbsp; I remember going &#8212; all kidding aside &#8212; there have been millions of women who&#8217;ve hit that hotline button.&nbsp; You know, all the brave guys I talk to, they say, &#8220;Biden, you&#8217;re overdoing this.&#8221;&nbsp; And I&#8217;d say, &#8220;Tell me &#8212; tell you what: If somebody who was twice your size, beating the living crap out of you and you were in the same apartment with them, how do you go and pick up the phone and call for help?&#8221;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Women would hide and say, &#8220;I can&#8217;t &#8212; I can&#8217;t say where I am.&nbsp; I &#8212; I don&#8217;t know.&nbsp; Help me.&nbsp; Help me.&#8221;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That&#8217;s how we got Microsoft and others in this &#8212; in this fight with us, to help us physically locate so the police could pick up where that call was coming from.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was the background when I first wrote the Violence Against Women Act in 1990 to provide more protection against domestic violence, stalking, sexual assault; to support survivors and help them find ways out of their abusive situations.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>They’d say, &#8220;Why didn’t &#8212; why didn’t she leave?&#8221;&nbsp; Well, she didn’t leave.&nbsp; She had no place to go, and she had two kids with her.&nbsp; No money.&nbsp; Nothing.&nbsp; No family to go to.&nbsp; Leave?<br>&nbsp;<br>I&#8217;ve been asked, time to time, was there &#8212; the reason, I guess, I got a little overwrought about this legislation early on &#8212; not that I ever get overwrought.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; But &#8212; and I &#8212; literally, the most oft-asked questions for the first three years of the act was, &#8220;Well, why are you so passionate about this?&nbsp; Was your mother a victim of domestic violence?&nbsp; Was your sister or your wife?&nbsp; Were they &#8212; were they victims?&#8221;&nbsp; I swear to God.&nbsp; That was the most oft-asked question of me.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And I&#8217;d say, &#8220;No, that&#8217;s not the answer.&#8221;&nbsp; I happened to be raised by a gentle, decent man, who taught all of his children &#8212; and I mean this from the bottom of my heart &#8212; Lisa, you know this; you knew my dad.&nbsp; My dad would say the greatest sin of all that anyone could commit was the abuse of power, and the cardinal sin was for a man to raise his hand to a woman or a child.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>That’s what this law has always been about: the abuse of power.&nbsp; Whether it ends in a rape or just the physical be- &#8212; it&#8217;s about the abuse of power. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So, I believed, as many of you in this room did, that &#8212; that I believe that too.&nbsp; And the only way we could change the culture was by shining an ugly, bright light on it and speaking its name.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>You can make all the speeches you wanted, but until those women had the courage &#8212; and I remember &#8212; I remember in a backroom hold and they said, &#8220;It&#8217;s going to be okay.&nbsp; It&#8217;s going to be okay.&#8221;&nbsp; Can you imagine being among the first to stand before the whole damn world and millions of people hear you recite how you were abused?<br>&nbsp;<br>It took enormous courage.&nbsp; And at the time, the Majority Leader may remember, we both got criticized for wanting to make it public.&nbsp; &#8220;We don’t want to do that.&nbsp; We don’t want to do that.&#8221;&nbsp; That’s why we held public hearings for this law when there were senators and others who said it was too salacious for this to be public, for people to see.<br>&nbsp;<br>You know, we &#8212; but I believed &#8212; and a lot of us did &#8212; that we had to let America know what was going on.&nbsp; Take the blinders off.&nbsp; Make them look at it square in the eye.&nbsp; All the ugly side of it.<br>&nbsp;<br>Because I believed, as all of you did, that Americans are basically decent and honorable people.&nbsp; But they didn’t want to get involved.&nbsp; Didn’t want to get involved.<br>&nbsp;<br>How many times have you been in a crowded airport or in a circumstance where you see a man not physically beating but abusing a woman &#8212; and you just say, &#8220;You know, I don’t want to hear that.&nbsp; I don’t want to &#8212; I don’t know what to do.&#8221;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Well, I believe that if they could see the truth as to what was going on, we could begin slowly to make change.&nbsp; And that’s exactly what you all did and that’s what happened.<br>&nbsp;<br>This law broke the dam of congressional resistance and cultural resistance.&nbsp; And it brought this hidden epidemic out of the shadows.&nbsp; You know, its introduction &#8212; it introduced our nation to so many brave survivors who those stories changed the way America saw the issue.&nbsp; I mean, in the literal sense, it&#8217;s hard to believe &#8212; even when I go back and think of when &#8212; how it started and where it was.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>As a practical matter, things began to shift &#8212; the legal and social burdens &#8212; away from survivors and onto perpetrators and where they belonged.&nbsp; It made addressing general &#8212; excuse me &#8212; gender violence a shared priority with a determined, coordinated response.&nbsp; It created a hotline, as I said, for millions of women who have used the hotline.&nbsp; And again, I&#8217;ll never forget being told the first time &#8212; I said, &#8220;What did you do?&#8221;&nbsp; She said, &#8220;I got behind the drapes and I held the phone.&nbsp; And I prayed to God &#8212; prayed to God &#8212; don’t let him hear this.&nbsp; Pray God.&nbsp; Pray God.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;<br>It supported shelters and rape crisis centers, housing and legal assistance, creating lifesaving options for women and children all across the country.&nbsp; And it helped train police officers, advocates, prosecutors, judges, court personnel to make the entire justice system fair and more responsive to the needs of survivors.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>I’ll never forget, Chris, I went to the family court when I was writing this &#8212; and the family court in my state is like many of yours.&nbsp; And I watched &#8212; because I was told this would happen &#8212; I watched a woman come up to the desk and say, &#8220;I want to report that my husband is beating me up.&#8221;&nbsp; &#8220;Well, why don’t you have a seat over there.&#8221;&nbsp; Not a joke.&nbsp; Go back and check your family courts back in the day.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp; That&#8217;s what happened.&nbsp; &#8220;That’s okay.&nbsp; You go over here.&nbsp; We&#8217;ll get to that.&#8221;&nbsp; &#8220;No, no, I &#8212; I need help now.&nbsp; Now.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;<br>You know, the law has saved lives.&nbsp; It&#8217;s helped women rebuild their lives.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The hardest thing to get done was arrest on information.&nbsp; Because what used to happen is a cop may be in the street and see a husband or a boyfriend or a man &#8212; anyone &#8212; smack his wife.&nbsp; And he&#8217;d come over and say, &#8220;Do you want to bring charges?&#8221;&nbsp; What the hell is she going to say? &nbsp;&#8220;Yeah, I want to bring…&#8221;&nbsp; We got the law changed to say the cop can arrest on information.&nbsp; He saw it happen.&nbsp; He saw it happen.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And all of these bad &#8212; these tough guys.&nbsp; (Laughter.)<br>&nbsp;<br>Even in 1994, we knew that there was much more we had to do &#8212; you know, that it was only the beginning.&nbsp; That’s why, because of all of you in this room, every time we’ve reauthorized this law, it&#8217;s been improved.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not like we didn’t know we wanted to do these other things in the beginning.&nbsp; It&#8217;s we did as much as we could and keep trying to add to it.&nbsp; You remember.&nbsp; You sat at my desk &#8212; a lot of time with me on this.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Broadening from domestic violence to include stalking and sexual assault in 2000. &nbsp;That was the change made.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Expanding access to services for immigrants and communities of color in 2005. &nbsp;That was a change.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Restoring jurisdiction of Tribal courts &#8212; (applause) &#8212; over non-Native domestic violence offenders who abuse women in Indian Country. &nbsp;We did that in 2013.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Extending protections to everyone, regardless of sexual orientation and gender identity, in 2013.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And I&#8217;m sorry to go on, but you all should &#8212; the country owes you &#8212; all of you.&nbsp; I really mean it.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; The law kept growing stronger.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not like we didn’t know in 2005 we should be dealing with the things we dealt with in 2013.&nbsp; It was getting it done.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Each link in the chain that we&#8217;re building made a difference &#8212; makes a difference.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Yesterday, I signed the Bipartisan Government Funding Bill.&nbsp; Thank you very much for that.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; And, consequentially, we forged the next link in the chain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not only &#8212; not only did we reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act through 2027 &#8212; and I have to wonder why the hell we can’t reauthorize it.&nbsp; It&#8217;s like the Voting Rights Act.&nbsp; I thought we had won when I got Strom Thurmond to vote for it and extend it for 25 years, and then the Court came along.&nbsp; But at any rate, that’s another issue.&nbsp; (Laughter.)<br>&nbsp;<br>But look, you know, I don&#8217;t &#8212; just think about this.&nbsp; If this affected manhood &#8212; men &#8212; I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;d have a problem, you know, doing it for even longer, making it permanent.&nbsp; But at any rate, that&#8217;s a different thing.<br>&nbsp;<br>Look, we delivered more help to survivors in rural areas &#8212; we understand &#8212; and in underserved communities for a simple reason: There is no place to go.<br>&nbsp;<br>You know, whether it&#8217;s Arizona or whether it&#8217;s Michigan, wherever it is, you&#8217;re in a rural area, you call, you get help, and you do get help, and then they leave.&nbsp; And the next nearest &#8212; and the next nearest town is 20 miles.&nbsp; How long does it take for the cop to get there?<br>&nbsp;<br>Tribal courts will now be able to exercise jurisdiction over non-Native perpetrators of sexual assault, child abuse, sex trafficking, and so much more.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br>&nbsp;<br>You have all added new services and resources for folks in most underserved communities &#8212; the LGBTQ community, survivors of those rural communities &#8212; providing more support and legal services, for law enforcement to get training they need to help handle the trauma of &#8212; survivors are experiencing.<br>&nbsp;<br>And, by the way, it&#8217;s not a criticism of the police.&nbsp; We &#8212; for all the mistakes police make and all the things they do wrong &#8212; we expect them to be everything from a counselor to a expert on sexual violence to an expert on all these things.&nbsp; But, you know, these are vast majority people with, you know, degrees that are two-year degrees after school.&nbsp; I mean, they’re the smart, but they &#8212; I mean, we expect them to be psychologists; we expect them to be everything.<br>&nbsp;<br>So we established a new civil rights &#8212; a new civil rights cause of action for those whose intimate images were shared on the public screen.&nbsp; How many times have you heard &#8212; I’ll bet everybody knows somebody somewhere along the line that in an intimate relationship, what happened was the guy takes a revealing picture of his naked friend, or whatever, in a compromising position, and then literally, in a sense, blackmails or mortifies that person &#8212; sends it out, put it online.<br>&nbsp;<br>We’re giving survivors real resources against abuse now.&nbsp; Ex-partners and stalkers who seek to humiliate and hurt them.<br>&nbsp;<br>We&#8217;ve created &#8212; you created new programs to help end the backlog of the rape kits.&nbsp; And those rape kits, by the way, I don&#8217;t know &#8212; you ought to go to your major cities, those of you in the House and Senate &#8212; this group probably has &#8212; which I have done.&nbsp; And this backlog is so significant.&nbsp; You could solve literally a significant portion of &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>Look, the only thing I learned that’s worse than &#8212; for a woman &#8212; worse than a woman who is abused or raped and says, “It&#8217;s Charlie who did it,” and no one believes her &#8212; him against her.&nbsp; And when &#8212; you can take a look.&nbsp; If you take a look at those rape kits and you went through them all, you could identify and arrest probably 40, 50 percent of the rapists in America.&nbsp; They&#8217;re all there.&nbsp; Their DNAs are there.&nbsp; It’s all in line.&nbsp; And run it against the whole panoply.&nbsp; Very few rapists rape only once.<br>&nbsp;<br>So, look, that &#8212; you know, there&#8217;s a lot that goes unprocessed.&nbsp; And we have to make sure survivors get compensation, and if there have been delays in their cases &#8212; you know, we&#8217;ve made improvements in the National Criminal Background Check System to help states investigate and prosecute cases when abuses &#8212; when abusers who are barred from purchasing firearms attempt to do so.&nbsp; That, we’ve done federally.&nbsp; Quite frankly, this held &#8212; that&#8217;s one of the things that held up this bill for much too long.&nbsp; Much too long.<br>&nbsp;<br>Those are just a few of the ways we’ve strengthened &#8212; you, not we &#8212; you’ve strengthened the law.&nbsp; Because I just came on the &#8212; back on the &#8212; on the range again.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; I haven’t been &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>But look, it comes on top of the work we&#8217;ve done together over the last years to make progress.&nbsp; We know the pandemic only exacerbated instances of domestic violence and sexual violence.&nbsp; It&#8217;s shot up like a Roman candle.<br>&nbsp;<br>And through the American Rescue Plan, the administration<br>directed $1 billion in supplemental funding for domestic violence and sexual assault services &#8212; (applause) &#8212; because they’re badly needed.<br>&nbsp;<br>And we’ve worked with local public housing authorities to make sure that survivors trapped in a bad situation can find safe new housing options in public housing.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Because they don’t have (inaudible) to go.&nbsp; You.<br>&nbsp;<br>And we also made landmark reforms in military justice to help end the epidemic of sexual violence and harassment in our armed forces &#8212; (applause) &#8212; fundamentally changing how the military investigates, prosecutes sexual assault, domestic violence, and other related crimes.<br>&nbsp;<br>Thank you, Kirsten Gillibrand.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Thank you, Jackie Speier.&nbsp; Is Jackie here?&nbsp; Stand up, please.&nbsp; Stand up.&nbsp; You did an incredible job.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Thank you, thank you, thank you. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Earlier this month, I signed a bar- &#8212; bipartisan bill that ends what we know as forced arbitration.&nbsp; That&#8217;s wonderful, isn’t it?&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; No, no, but I mean the small print to sign a contract, and the small print says you can&#8217;t do anything if your boss, male or female &#8212; if you end up getting abused and if you end up doing something &#8212; you know, you can&#8217;t &#8212; you have to do it internally.&nbsp; No more.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; No more.&nbsp; Really.<br>&nbsp;<br>And 80 percent of the people who sign those don&#8217;t even know what&#8217;s in the &#8212; in the contract.<br>&nbsp;<br>The mechanism has prevented too many survivors of abuse and harassment in the workplace from having the choice to get their day in court.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Look, these are just a few of the steps you&#8217;ve all taken and how much you&#8217;ve improved this legislation.&nbsp; But as everyone in this room knows, this work is not going to stop.&nbsp; It never stops.<br>&nbsp;<br>Today, one year since a gunman killed eight people in Atlanta, six of whom were women of Asian descent, these horrific murders are a reminder that we still have work to do to put an end to misogyny and racism and all forms of hate we have.<br>&nbsp;<br>We&#8217;re never going to get it all done, but we can&#8217;t ever stop trying.&nbsp; As long as there are women in this country and around the world who live in fear of violence, there&#8217;s more we have to do to fulfill this sacred commitment.&nbsp; No one &#8212; no one, regardless of gender or sexual orientation, should experience abuse.&nbsp; Period.&nbsp; And if they do, they should have the services and support they need to get through it.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re not going to rest.<br>&nbsp;<br>But in the meantime, all of you should be enormously proud of what you&#8217;ve accomplished.&nbsp; This reauthorization is testament to the power of your voices and your tireless dedication to changing things for the better.<br>&nbsp;<br>And one last thing: Some of you in here helped me work on the International Violence Against Women Act.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; I&#8217;m coming back.&nbsp; Seriously.<br>&nbsp;<br>And I&#8217;ll tell you a very short concluding story.<br>&nbsp;<br>When I was Vice President &#8212; I can&#8217;t remember, probably the seventh year in or thereabouts &#8212; I was in India, and I met &#8212; at the home where Mahatma Gandhi was able to be hidden for a long while.&nbsp; And &#8212; and &#8212; and I met with two of the daughters of India&#8217;s most serious liberators.&nbsp; And, you know, I thought they were going to ask me questions about, you know, U.S.-India relations.&nbsp; They said, “Can you help us write a Violence Against Women Act?”&nbsp; Not a joke.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Just by some of you speaking out &#8212; Republicans and Democrats &#8212; just by your speaking out about how we abhor those nations that do, in fact, call for &#8212; and go through the list &#8212; it’s changing behaviors.&nbsp; I think we have to even be stronger than that, but that’s another &#8212; that’s another boring speech.&nbsp; (Laughter.)<br>&nbsp;<br>But, look, let’s keep going.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you all.&nbsp; May God bless you all, and may God protect our troops.&nbsp; Thank you, thank you, thank you.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br>&nbsp;<br>2:34 P.M. EDT<br>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">South Court Auditorium<br>Eisenhower Executive Office Building</p>



<p>1:01 P.M. EDT</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Good afternoon.&nbsp; I want to begin by thanking President Zelenskyy for his passionate message this morning.&nbsp; I listened to it in the private residence, and he was convincing.&nbsp; And &#8212; significant speech.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He speaks for a people who have shown remarkable courage and strength in the face of brutal aggression &#8212; courage and strength that has inspired not only Ukrainians but the entire world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Putin is inflicting appalling &#8212; appalling devastation and horror on Ukraine &#8212; bombing apartment buildings, maternity wards, hospitals.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean, it’s &#8212; it’s God awful.&nbsp; I was speaking about this with the &#8212; our &#8212; our Commander, behind me here &#8212; General Milley.&nbsp; I mean, it just is amazing.</p>



<p>Yesterday, we saw reports that Russian forces were holding hundreds of doctors and patients hostage in the largest hospital in Mariupol.&nbsp; These are atrocities.&nbsp; They’re an outrage to the world.&nbsp; And the world is united in our support for Ukraine and our determination to make Putin pay a very heavy price.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; America is leading this effort, together with our Allies and partners, providing enormous levels of security and humanitarian assistance that we’re adding to today and we’re going to continue to do more in the days and weeks ahead.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are crippling Putin’s economy with punishing sanctions that’s going to only grow more painful over time with the entire NATO and EU behind us, and many other countries.</p>



<p>What’s at stake here are the principles that the United States and the united nations across the world stand for.&nbsp; It’s about freedom.&nbsp; It’s about the right of people to determine their own future.&nbsp; It’s about making sure Ukraine never &#8212; will never be a victory for Putin, no matter what advances he makes on the battlefield.</p>



<p>The American people are answering President Zelenskyy’s call for more help, more weapons for Ukraine to defend itself, more tools to fight Russian aggression.&nbsp; And that’s what we’re doing.</p>



<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, we started our assistance to Ukraine before this war began, as they started to do exercises along the Ukrainian border &#8212; the Russians &#8212; starting in March of last year.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We took the threat of Putin invading very seriously, and we acted on it.&nbsp; We sent Ukraine more security assistance last year &#8212; $650 million in weapons, including anti-air and anti-armor equipment before the invasion &#8212; more than we had ever provided before.&nbsp; So when the invasion began, they already had in their hands the kinds of weapons they needed to counter Russian advances.</p>



<p>And once the war started, we immediately rushed $350 million in additional aid to further address their needs: hundreds of anti-air systems, thousands of anti-tank weapons, transport helicopters, armed patrol boats, and other high-mobility vehicles, radar systems that help track incoming artillery and unmanned drones, secure communications equipment and tactical gear, satellite imagery and &#8212; and analysis capacity.&nbsp; And it’s clearly helped Ukraine inflict dramatic losses on Russian forces.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>On Saturday, my administration authorized another $200 million to keep a steady flow of weapons and ammunition moving to Ukraine.&nbsp; Now I’m once again using my presidential authority to activate &#8212; to activate additional security assistance to continue to help Ukraine fend off Russia’s assault &#8212; an additional $800 million in assistance.&nbsp;&nbsp;That brings the total of new U.S. security assistance to Ukraine to $1 billion just this week.&nbsp; These are the lar- &#8212; these are direct transfers of equipment from our Department of Defense to the Ukrainian military to help them as they fight against this invasion.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I thank the Congress for appropriating these funds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This new package on its own is going to provide unprecedented assistance to Ukraine.&nbsp; It includes 800 anti-aircraft systems to make sure the Ukrainian military can continue to &#8212; can continue to stop the planes and helicopters that have been attacking their people and to defend their Ukrainian airspace.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>And at the request of President Zelenskyy, we have identified and are helping Ukraine acquire additional longer-range anti-aircraft systems and the munitions for those systems.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our new assistance package also includes 9,000 anti-armor systems.&nbsp; These are portable, high &#8212; high-accurate &#8212; high accurately &#8212; high-accuracy shoulder-mounted missiles that the Ukrainian forces have been using with great effect to destroy invading tanks and armored vehicles.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’ll include 7,000 small arms &#8212; machine guns, shotguns, grenade launchers &#8212; to equip the Ukrainians, including the brave women and men who are defending their cities as civilians, and they’re on the countryside as well.&nbsp; And we’re &#8212; and we &#8212; and as well as the ammunition, artillery, and mortar rounds to go with small arms &#8212; 20 million rounds in total.&nbsp; Twenty million rounds.&nbsp; And this will include drones, which &#8212; which demonstrates our commitment to sending our most cutting-edge systems to Ukraine for its defense.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And we’re not doing this alone.&nbsp; Our Allies and partners have stepped up to provide significant shipments of security assistance and will continue to help facilitate these deliveries as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The United States and our Allies and partners are fully committed to surging weapons of assistance to the Ukrainians.&nbsp;&nbsp;And more will be coming as we source additional stocks of equipment that are &#8212; that we’re ready to transfer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now &#8212; now, I want to be honest with you: This could be a long and difficult battle.&nbsp; But the American people will be steadfast in our support of the people of Ukraine in the face of Putin’s immoral, unethical attacks on civilian populations.&nbsp; We are united in our abhorrence of Putin’s depraved onslaught, and we’re going to continue to have their back as they fight for their freedom, their democracy, their very survival.&nbsp; And we’re going to give Ukraine the arms to fight and defend themselves through all the difficult days ahead.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re going to continue to mobilize humanitarian relief to support people within Ukraine and those who have been forced to flee Ukraine.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In just the past few weeks, we’ve provided $300 million in humanitarian assistance to the people in Ukraine and in neighboring countries.&nbsp; Tens of thousands of tons of food, water, medicine, and other basic supplies to support the people in need.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our experts on the ground in Poland and Moldova and other neighboring countries are there to make real-time assessments of the rapidly evolving crisis and get urgently needed humanitarian supplies to the people in need when they need it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>And we will support Ukraine’s economy with direct financial assistance as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>And together with our Allies and partners, we will keep up the pressure on Putin’s crumbling economy, isolating him on the global stage.&nbsp; That’s our goal: make Putin pay the price, weaken his position while strengthening the hand of the Ukrainians on the battlefield and at the negotiating table.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Together with our Allies and partners, we&#8217;re going to stay the course.&nbsp; And we&#8217;ll do everything we can to push for and end this tragic, unnecessary war.&nbsp; This is a struggle that pits the appetites of an autocrat against humankind’s desire to be free.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And let there be no doubt, no uncertainty, no question:&nbsp;America stands with the forces of freedom.&nbsp; We always have and we always will.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I want to thank you all.&nbsp; And God bless you.&nbsp; And now I&#8217;m going to walk over and sign this legisla- &#8212; sign this bill to allow the drawdown of those materials.</p>



<p>And may God protect the young Ukrainians who are out there defending their country.</p>



<p>What I&#8217;m signing here is the Delegation of Authority Under Section 506(a)(1) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961.&nbsp; Translated into plain English: a total of $800 million in defense articles.</p>



<p>(The Delegation of Authority is signed.)</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. President, what will it take for you to send the Polish MiGs that President Zelenskyy is asking for?</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; I&#8217;m not going to comment on that right now.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not going to comment on anything other than what I told you (inaudible).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thank you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>This week, President Biden signed into law the Violence Against Women Act Reauthorization Act of 2022, bipartisan legislation passed by Congress as part of the Omnibus appropriations package.</p>



<p>One of the driving forces of President Biden’s career has been fighting back against abuses of power.&nbsp; That force led him to write and champion the groundbreaking Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) as a U.S. Senator, landmark legislation that first passed in 1994.&nbsp; In the nearly three decades since, he has worked with Members of Congress from both parties to pass legislation to renew and strengthen VAWA three times: in 2000, 2005, and 2013. &nbsp;Each time, he worked to expand access to safety and support for all survivors and increase prevention efforts.&nbsp; Preventing and responding to gender-based violence wherever it occurs, and in all of its forms, has remained a cornerstone of the President’s career in public service—from VAWA reauthorization to a national campaign to combat campus sexual assault to reforms to address sexual assault and harassment in the military. &nbsp;</p>



<p>While incidents of domestic violence and sexual assault have declined significantly since VAWA first took effect—and efforts to increase access to services, healing, and justice for survivors have improved with each iteration of VAWA—much work remains.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>The 2022 reauthorization of VAWA strengthens this landmark law, including by:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Reauthorizing all current VAWA grant programs until 2027 and, in many cases, increasing authorization levels.&nbsp;</li><li>Expanding special criminal jurisdiction of Tribal courts to cover non-Native perpetrators of sexual assault, child abuse, stalking, sex trafficking, and assaults on tribal law enforcement officers on tribal lands; and supporting the development of a pilot project to enhance access to safety for survivors in Alaska Native villages.</li><li>Increasing services and support for survivors from underserved and marginalized communities—including for LGBTQ+ survivors of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault and stalking; funding survivor-centered, community-based restorative practice services; and increasing support for culturally specific services and services in rural communities.</li><li>Establishing a federal civil cause of action for individuals whose intimate visual images are disclosed without their consent, allowing a victim to recover damages and legal fees; creating a new National Resource Center on Cybercrimes Against Individuals; and supporting State, Tribal, and local government efforts to prevent and prosecute cybercrimes, including cyberstalking and the nonconsensual distribution of intimate images.</li><li>Improving prevention and response to sexual violence, including through increased support for the Rape Prevention and Education Program and Sexual Assault Services Program; expansion of prevention education for students in institutions of higher education; and enactment of the Fairness for Rape Kit Backlog Survivors Act, which requires state victim compensation programs to allow sexual assault survivors to file for compensation without being unfairly penalized due to rape kit backlogs.</li><li>Strengthening the application of evidence-based practices by law enforcement in responding to gender-based violence, including by promoting the use of trauma-informed, victim-centered training and improving homicide reduction initiatives.</li><li>Improving the healthcare system’s response to domestic violence and sexual assault, including through enhanced training for sexual assault forensic examiners.</li><li>Updating the SMART Prevention Program and the CHOOSE Youth Program to reduce dating violence, help children who have been exposed to domestic violence, and engage men in preventing violence.</li><li>Enacting the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) Denial Notification Act to help state law enforcement investigate and prosecute cases against individuals legally prohibited from purchasing firearms who try to do so.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Over the past year, the Biden-Harris Administration has taken significant steps to prevent and respond to gender-based violence at home and abroad:</strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>Increased funding for domestic violence and sexual assault services.&nbsp; </strong>Directed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2021/10/25/hhs-announces-nearly-800-million-american-rescue-plan-funds-support-domestic-violence-sexual-assault-survivors-their-children.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$1 billion in supplemental funding</a>&nbsp;for&nbsp;domestic violence and sexual assault services&nbsp;through the American Rescue Plan (ARP) in response to the pandemic, including&nbsp;<a href="https://www.acf.hhs.gov/fysb/grant-funding/2021-fvpsa-american-rescue-plan-culturally-specific-program-instruction-guidance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$49.5 million for culturally-specific community-based organizations</a>&nbsp;that help survivors from historically marginalized communities access the services and support they need. The ARP also provided approximately 70,000 housing choice vouchers to local Public Housing Authorities in order to assist individuals and families, including those who are fleeing, or attempting to flee, from domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, stalking, or human trafficking.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Reformed the military justice system to address sexual assault, harassment, and related crimes. </strong>Signed into law&nbsp;the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/12/27/statement-by-the-president-on-s-1605-the-national-defense-authorization-act-for-fiscal-year-2022/">National Defense Authorization Act</a>, which included&nbsp;sweeping reforms to the military justice system—the most significant since the Uniform Code of Military Justice was established more than seventy years ago—and implemented the President’s campaign promise to address the scourge of sexual assault in our armed forces.&nbsp;In conjunction with the President’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2022/01/26/executive-order-on-2022-amendments-to-the-manual-for-courts-martial-united-states/">Executive Order</a>&nbsp;on military justice reform, this bipartisan, historic law adopts core recommendations of&nbsp;the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/02/statement-of-president-joe-biden-on-the-results-of-the-independent-review-commission-on-military-sexual-assault/">Independent Review Commission on Sexual Assault</a>, as called for by President Biden, and fundamentally shifts how the military prosecutes and investigates sexual assault, domestic violence, sexual harassment, and other serious crimes, and increases prevention initiatives and support for survivors.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Ended forced arbitration for sexual assault and harassment.&nbsp; </strong>Signed into law the&nbsp;Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act&nbsp;of 2021—bipartisan legislation that empowers survivors of sexual assault and harassment by giving them a choice to go to court instead of being forced into arbitration.</li><li><strong>Directed action to protect students from campus sexual assault.&nbsp; </strong>Directed the Department of Education to&nbsp;review Title IX regulations&nbsp;and other agency actions to ensure that all students have an educational environment that is free from discrimination on the basis of sex. &nbsp;The Department is developing a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking currently under review that will address the need for protection for students who experience campus sexual assault while treating all students fairly.</li><li><strong>Increased resources for survivors of crime, including gender-based violence.&nbsp; </strong>Signed into law the&nbsp;Amendments to the Victims of Crime Act&nbsp;(VOCA), which passed Congress with strong bipartisan support and expands the allocation of resources for the Crime Victims Fund. This has already resulted in an increase of hundreds of millions of dollars of non-taxpayer funding for essential and lifesaving services to crime victims around the country, including survivors of gender-based violence.</li><li><strong>Led multinational effort to address online harassment and abuse.&nbsp; </strong>Launched the Global Partnership for Action on Gender-Based Online Harassment and Abuse during the 2022 meeting of the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women, together with the governments of Denmark, Australia, the United Kingdom, and Sweden. This multinational initiative will align countries, international organizations, and civil society to better prioritize, understand, and address the growing scourge of technology-facilitated gender-based violence.</li><li><strong>Prioritized the crisis of Missing or Murdered Indigenous People, including gender-based violence.</strong> &nbsp;Issued an executive order directing the Departments of Justice, Interior, Homeland Security and Health and Human Services to create a strategy to improve public safety and justice for Native Americans and to address the epidemic of missing or murdered Indigenous peoples, which disproportionately affect Native women, girls, and LGBTQI+ individuals; the Department of the Interior established the Missing and Murdered Unit to pursue justice for missing or murdered American Indians and Alaska Natives.</li><li><strong>Strengthened regional leadership on violence against Indigenous women and girls.&nbsp; </strong>Re-launched the United States’ leadership and participation in the&nbsp;Trilateral Working Group on Violence Against Indigenous Women and Girls&nbsp;with the Governments of Mexico and Canada. The White House will host the Fourth Convening of the Trilateral Working Group this summer to improve and reaffirm our respective national and regional commitments to prevent and respond to violence against Indigenous women and girls through increased access to justice and prevention services.</li></ul>



<p>On International Women’s Day in 2021, President Biden signed an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/03/08/executive-order-on-establishment-of-the-white-house-gender-policy-council/">Executive Order</a> creating the White House Gender Policy Council and calling for the development of the first-ever government-wide National Action Plan to End Gender-Based Violence, as well as an update to the 2016 United States Strategy to Prevent and Respond to Gender-Based Violence Globally. These strategies will provide a roadmap to guide the Biden-Harris Administration’s whole-of-government effort to end gender-based violence—and in so doing, create a society where survivors are supported and all people can live free from abuse.</p>

<p>President Biden today announced an additional $800 million in security assistance to Ukraine, bringing the total U.S. security assistance committed to Ukraine to $1 billion in just the past week, and a total of $2 billion since the start of the Biden Administration. The assistance will take the form of direct transfers of equipment from the Department of Defense to the Ukrainian military to help them defend their country against Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified invasion.<br><br>The new $800 million assistance package includes:</p>



<ul><li>800 Stinger anti-aircraft systems;</li><li>2,000 Javelin, 1,000 light anti-armor weapons, and 6,000 AT-4 anti-armor systems;</li><li>100 Tactical Unmanned Aerial Systems;</li><li>100 grenade launchers, 5,000 rifles, 1,000 pistols, 400 machine guns, and 400 shotguns;</li><li>Over 20 million rounds of small arms ammunition and grenade launcher and mortar rounds;</li><li>25,000 sets of body armor; and</li><li>25,000 helmets.</li></ul>



<p>In addition to the weapons listed above, previous United States assistance committed to Ukraine includes:</p>



<ul><li>Over 600 Stinger anti-aircraft systems;</li><li>Approximately 2,600 Javelin anti-armor systems;</li><li>Five Mi-17 helicopters;</li><li>Three patrol boats;</li><li>Four counter-artillery and counter-unmanned aerial system tracking radars;</li><li>Four counter-mortar radar systems;</li><li>200 grenade launchers and ammunition;</li><li>200 shotguns and 200 machine guns;</li><li>Nearly 40 million rounds of small arms ammunition and over 1 million grenade, mortar, and artillery rounds;</li><li>70 High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles (HMMWVs) and other vehicles;</li><li>Secure communications, electronic warfare detection systems, body armor, helmets, and other tactical gear;</li><li>Military medical equipment to support treatment and combat evacuation;</li><li>Explosive ordnance disposal and demining equipment; and</li><li>Satellite imagery and analysis capability.</li></ul>



<p>In addition to the U.S.-produced short-range air defense systems the Ukrainians have been using to great effect, the United States has also identified and is helping the Ukrainians acquire additional, longer-range systems on which Ukraine’s forces are already trained, as well as additional munitions for those systems.</p>



<p>The United States continues to expedite the authorization and facilitation of additional assistance to Ukraine from our Allies. At least 30 countries have provided security assistance to Ukraine since the Russian invasion began. In 2022, the Department of State authorized third-party transfers of defensive equipment from more than 14 countries, a number that continues to grow as Allies and Partners increase support to Ukraine.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Vice President Harris To Make Announcement During White House Event</em> <em>March 16<sup>th</sup>, 2022</em></p>



<p>In the last three months, more than one-third of our country’s Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) have received bomb threats. While, thankfully, no explosive devices were found on any of these campuses, significant and lasting damage has been done by threatening the safety and security of the students, faculty, and staff at these institutions. As a result of these threats, learning has been disrupted, critical resources have been diverted to emergency response, and there has been an increased burden on already overwhelmed campus mental health systems. HBCU students – already experiencing negative impacts from the pandemic such as lingering effects of illness, trauma, and basic needs insecurities – are now experiencing additional stress and anxiety because of these bomb threats that can negatively affect their academic success.</p>



<p>It is important to view these recent and repeated threats through both the lens of the present day as well as our country’s history. HBCUs were founded to educate Black people in an America that refused to accept them as full human beings and prevented them – because of racial discrimination – from attending other colleges. Threats to the education and well-being of Black Americans and HBCUs are an unfortunate part of American history. The bomb threats that we witnessed in January, each week in February – Black History Month, and this month are reminiscent of the attempts during the Civil Rights Era to intimidate and provoke fear in Black Americans.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Biden-Harris Administration is taking a whole-of-government approach in responding to these threats and ensuring the safety and well-being of students, staff, and faculty. Immediately following the first reports of the threats, Education Secretary Cardona and Homeland Security Secretary Mayorkas hosted a briefing with more than 40 presidents of HBCUs from across the nation to share information on grant programs, training resources, and other tools available to HBCUs to strengthen campus safety and security. Leaders from the Department of Education (ED) and other federal agencies have visited HBCU campuses. During these visits, federal officials heard firsthand about the need to modernize and update their operations, including campus safety and security, as well as the need for more resources to help bolster mental health services due to increased apprehension across the campus community.</p>



<p>Today, in response to these needs, Vice President Kamala Harris is announcing that HBCUs that have recently experienced a bomb threat resulting in a disruption to the campus learning environment are eligible for grant funds. These grant funds are from the Project School Emergency Response to Violence (Project SERV) program at ED. Project SERV provides short-term, immediate funding for local educational agencies and institutions of higher education that have experienced a violent or traumatic incident to assist in restoring a safe environment conducive to learning.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ED will work with the HBCUs that have received recent bomb threats to determine if Project SERV can help get funds to their campuses for immediate needs, such as targeted mental health resources or enhanced security, to restore the learning environment on their campuses. ED is able to provide this funding to HBCUs to ensure students feel safe on their campuses. ED staff will work with each HBCU to help determine their specific immediate needs. Awards typically range from $50,000 to $150,000 per school.</p>



<p>In addition to the short-term funds provided through Project SERV, the Biden-Harris Administration is providing HBCUs a compendium of resources that are available across the federal government – from ED, Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Homeland Security, and Department of Justice – to help with long-term improvements to campus mental health programs, campus safety, and emergency management planning and response. The resource guide offers a centralized source of information on grant programs and technical assistance activities across federal agencies.</p>



<p>These announcements today build off the historic investments and support the Biden-Harris Administration has already delivered to HBCUs – $5.8 billion in total to date, including more than $2.7 billion in American Rescue Plan funding – to ameliorate chronic underfunding and help address critical needs brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>



<p>Educational opportunity is a fundamental element of the American promise and HBCUs have played an outsized role in securing that opportunity for Black people. As President Biden indicated in Executive Order 14041 – which re-established the White House Initiative on HBCUs – HBCUs have a proud history and legacy of achievement. That legacy continues, with more than 100 HBCUs, located in 19 states, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. Virgin Islands that serve nearly 300,000 students annually. These storied institutions have excelled, in the face of discrimination, and their strength and convictions will not be compromised by these violent bomb threats.<br></p>

<p>One year ago today, eight people, six of them women of Asian descent, were tragically killed by a gunman who attacked three Asian-run businesses. These horrific murders shook communities across America and underscored how far we have to go in this country to fight racism, misogyny, and all forms of hate—and the epidemic of gun violence that enables these extremists.<br><br>In the aftermath of these senseless deaths, the Vice President and I traveled to Atlanta to meet with leaders of the Asian American community. We heard about the terror and anguish that too many Asian Americans have felt since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, when anti-Asian xenophobia, harassment, and violence skyrocketed to alarming levels. Grandparents afraid to leave their homes. Small business owners targeted and gunned down. Families living in fear for their lives just walking down the street in America. It was a stark reminder that anti-Asian violence and discrimination have deep roots in our nation, with Asian American women experiencing the compounded harms of being targeted on account of their race as well as their gender.<br><br>Today, we honor the victims, their families, and the Atlanta community that has shown extraordinary resilience in the face of tragedy. While nothing we do can bring the victims back, their loss has compelled us to reckon with our nation’s long legacy of anti-Asian sentiment and gender-based violence, and recommit ourselves to delivering the full measure of justice, safety, and dignity the Asian American and Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander community and all communities deserve. I was proud to sign the bipartisan COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act into law last May, which dedicated new tools and resources across government and law enforcement to help prevent, track, and respond to acts of hate, along with new Department of Justice grants and other measures to enhance community engagement, empowerment, and education.<br><br>This tragedy is also yet another reminder of the gun violence epidemic. My Administration has taken more executive action to reduce gun violence than any other Administration it its first year. But there is more to do—and Congress must act.<br><br>On this somber anniversary, my Administration remains fully committed to advancing safety, inclusion, and belonging for all Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders—especially the women and girls who disproportionately bear the burdens of hate—and to reducing the gun violence that terrorizes our communities. Together, we must build a future where no one fears violence.</p>
