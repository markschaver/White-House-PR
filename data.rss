										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>1.  On January 11, 2018, the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) transmitted to the President a report on the Secretary&#8217;s investigation into the effect of imports of steel mill articles (steel articles) on the national security of the United States under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1862).  The Secretary found and advised the President of his opinion that steel articles are being imported into the United States in such quantities and under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the United States.<br><br>2.  In Proclamation 9705 of March 8, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Steel Into the United States), the President concurred in the Secretary&#8217;s finding that steel articles, as defined in clause 1 of Proclamation 9705, as amended by clause 8 of Proclamation 9711 of March 22, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Steel Into the United States), are being imported into the United States in such quantities and under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the United States, and decided to adjust the imports of those steel articles by imposing a 25 percent ad valorem tariff on such articles imported from all countries except Canada and Mexico.  The proclamation further stated that any country with which we have a security relationship is welcome to discuss with the United States alternative ways to address the threatened impairment to the national security caused by imports from that country, and noted that, should the United States and any such country arrive at a satisfactory alternative means to address the threat to the national security such that the President determines that imports from that country no longer threaten to impair the national security, the President may remove or modify the restriction on steel articles imports from that country and, if necessary, adjust the tariff as it applies to other countries, as the national security interests of the United States require.<br><br>3.  The United States has successfully concluded discussions with Japan on satisfactory alternative means to address the threatened impairment to the national security posed by imports of steel articles and derivative steel articles from Japan.  The United States and Japan have agreed to expand coordination involving trade remedies and customs matters, monitor bilateral steel and aluminum trade, cooperate on addressing non-market excess capacity and carbon intensity in these sectors, and annually review their arrangement and their ongoing cooperation.<br><br>4.  The United States will implement a number of actions, including a tariff-rate quota that restricts the quantity of steel articles imported into the United States from Japan without the application of the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9705.  Under the arrangement, steel articles that are melted and poured in Japan are eligible for in-quota treatment.  In my judgment, these measures will provide an effective, long-term alternative means to address any contribution by Japanese steel articles imports to the threatened impairment to the national security by restraining steel articles imports to the United States from Japan, limiting transshipment, discouraging excess steel capacity and production, and strengthening the United States-Japan partnership.  In light of this agreement, I have determined that imports of specified volumes of eligible steel articles from Japan will no longer threaten to impair the national security and have decided to exclude such imports from Japan up to a designated quota from the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9705.  The United States will monitor the implementation and effectiveness of the tariff-rate quota and other measures agreed upon with Japan in addressing our national security needs, and I may revisit this determination, as appropriate.<br><br>5.  The alternative means, including the tariff-rate quota, advance the recommendations contained in the Secretary&#8217;s January 2018 report.  The agreed-upon aggregate tariff-rate quota volume specified in the agreement between the United States and Japan, totaling 1.25 million metric tons, is consistent with the objective of reaching and maintaining a sufficient capacity utilization rate in the domestic steel industry.<br><br>6.  In light of my determination to adjust the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9705 as applied to eligible steel articles imported from Japan, I have considered whether it is necessary and appropriate in light of our national security interests to make any corresponding adjustments to such tariff as it applies to other countries.  I have determined that it is necessary and appropriate, at this time, to maintain the current tariff level as it applies to other countries.<br><br>7.  Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, authorizes the President to adjust the imports of an article and its derivatives that are being imported into the United States in such quantities or under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security.<br><br>8.  Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), authorizes the President to embody in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) the substance of statutes affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction.<br><br>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, including section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, section 301 of title 3, United States Code, and section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, do hereby proclaim as follows:<br><br>(1)  To establish a tariff-rate quota on imports of steel articles from Japan as set forth in paragraph 4 of this proclamation, U.S. Note 16 of subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTSUS is amended as provided for in the Annex to this proclamation.  Imports of steel articles from Japan in excess of the tariff-rate quota quantities shall remain subject to the duties imposed by clause 2 of Proclamation 9705, as amended.  The Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security and the United States Trade Representative, shall recommend to the President, as warranted, updates to the in-quota volumes contained in the Annex to this proclamation.  Steel articles from Japan imported under an exclusion granted pursuant to clause 3 of Proclamation 9705, as amended, shall count against the in-quota volume of the tariff-rate quota established in clause 1 of this proclamation.<br><br>(2)  Clause 2 of Proclamation 9705, as amended, is revised to read as follows:  <br>     &#8220;(2)(a) In order to establish certain modifications to the duty rate on imports of steel articles, subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTSUS is modified as provided in the Annex to this proclamation and any subsequent proclamations regarding such steel articles.<br>     (b) Except as otherwise provided in this proclamation, or in notices published pursuant to clause 3 of this proclamation, all steel articles imports covered by heading 9903.80.01, in subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTSUS, shall be subject to an additional 25 percent ad valorem rate of duty with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, as follows:  (i) on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on March 23, 2018, from all countries except Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, South Korea, and the member countries of the European Union;

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>April marks Second Chance Month, when we reaffirm the importance of helping people who were formerly incarcerated reenter society.&nbsp; America is a Nation of second chances, and it is critical that our criminal and juvenile justice systems provide meaningful opportunities for rehabilitation and redemption. &nbsp;It is also vital that we address both the root causes of crime and the underlying needs of returning citizens using resources devoted to prevention, diversion, reentry, trauma-informed care, culturally-specific services, and social support. &nbsp;By supporting people who are committed to rectifying their mistakes, redefining themselves, and making meaningful contributions to society, we help reduce recidivism and build safer communities.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every year, over 640,000 people are released from State and Federal prisons. &nbsp;More than 70 million Americans have a criminal record that creates significant barriers to employment, economic stability, and successful reentry into society. &nbsp;Thousands of legal and regulatory restrictions prevent these individuals from accessing employment, housing, voting, education, business licensing, and other basic opportunities. &nbsp;Because of these barriers, nearly 75 percent of people who were formerly incarcerated are still unemployed a year after being released.</p>



<p>     We must rethink the existing criminal justice system and whom we send to prison and for how long; how unaddressed trauma and abuse create pipelines to incarceration; how people are treated while incarcerated; how prepared they are to reenter society once they have served their time; and how the racial inequities that lead to disproportionate numbers of incarcerated people of color and other underserved groups.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My Administration recognizes that making the criminal and juvenile justice systems more equitable, just, and effective requires a holistic approach.&nbsp; It requires eliminating exceedingly long sentences and mandatory minimums that keep people incarcerated longer than they should be. &nbsp;It requires quality job training and educational opportunities during incarceration. &nbsp;It requires providing formerly incarcerated individuals with opportunities to enter the workforce, reunite with their families, find stable and safe homes, and access health care.&nbsp; It requires expunging and sealing certain criminal records so that people&#8217;s futures are not defined by their past.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is why my Administration is working across Federal agencies to eliminate barriers to reentry. &nbsp;We are expanding avenues for employment, housing, education, health services, civic engagement, and other benefits. &nbsp;Last fall, the Department of Justice convened the Reentry Coordination Council in collaboration with the Departments of Housing and Urban Development, Agriculture, Education, Health and Human Services, Veterans Affairs, and Labor. &nbsp;I am confident that our collective efforts will help make our communities safer and stronger by reducing crime, recidivism, mass incarceration, and elements of the justice system that foster harmful disparate impacts on people of color and other historically disadvantaged communities.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But despite our progress, much more work remains.&nbsp; Our&nbsp;Federal, State, local, territorial, and Tribal governments, private employers, philanthropies, and community leaders play a significant role in preparing individuals returning to our communities for success.&nbsp; Together, let us recommit to empower Americans who have paid their debt to society and to provide them with a second chance to participate, contribute, and succeed.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United&nbsp;States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United&nbsp;States, do hereby proclaim April&nbsp;2022 as Second Chance Month.&nbsp; I call upon all government officials, educators, volunteers, and all the people of the United States to observe the month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.</p>



<p>     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-sixth.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-right">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; I was raised to believe that one of the greatest sins is the abuse of power –- whether it is economic, psychological, or physical. &#160;The cruel fact is that people of every age, ability, race, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, national origin, socioeconomic background, and religion suffer the pain and trauma of the abuse&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was raised to believe that one of the greatest sins is the abuse of power –- whether it is economic, psychological, or physical. &nbsp;The cruel fact is that people of every age, ability, race, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, national origin, socioeconomic background, and religion suffer the pain and trauma of the abuse of power that is sexual assault. &nbsp;Sexual violence can occur anywhere &#8212; and millions of assaults occur each year at the workplace, in the home, at school, and online. &nbsp;These assaults are an intolerable affront to our shared humanity.&nbsp; During National Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month, we renew our commitment to ensuring that every person can live a life free from sexual violence.&nbsp; We continue in our commitment to stand with survivors, hold perpetrators accountable, and dismantle a culture that is complicit in allowing sexual violence to continue.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sexual assault is also a public health crisis.&nbsp; According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nearly 1 in 5 women in America experiences a rape or attempted rape, and nearly 44 percent of women and about 25 percent of all men experience some form of sexual violence in their lifetime.&nbsp; Tragically, many of those assaulted are young, and research shows that these assaults can have lifelong effects on health and are linked to chronic illnesses. &nbsp;Too often, this trauma is compounded by lost productivity, the challenge of seeking accountability, and the ensuing costs of medical and mental health care.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My Administration is committed to supporting survivors and alleviating the public health crisis of sexual assault.&nbsp; That is&nbsp;why we included $450 million in the American Rescue Plan to&nbsp;provide funding for domestic violence and sexual assault services, including rape crisis centers.&nbsp; We also included a historic commitment to funding culturally-specific community-based organizations to address the needs of survivors who face systemic barriers to accessing support and resources, including survivors of color, survivors with disabilities, and LGBTQI+ survivors.&nbsp; My Administration continues to fund innovative programs to support sexual assault survivors in rural and remote communities.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am committed to addressing sexual violence wherever it occurs.&nbsp; Last year, I issued an Executive Order directing the Department of Education to review Title IX regulations and other agency actions to ensure that all students have an educational environment that is free from discrimination on the basis of sex.&nbsp; Because 1 in 3 women under the age of 35 has experienced sexual harassment online, I have made addressing online forms of sexual violence, harassment, and abuse a priority, and my Administration recently launched a new Global Partnership for Action on Gender-Based Online Harassment and Abuse.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sexual violence is also a matter of national security and military readiness.&nbsp; To advance the goal of eliminating sexual assault in our Armed Forces, I signed the 2022 National Defense Authorization Act, which includes the historic shift of legal decisions in cases of sexual assault from commanders to independent, specialized military prosecutors. &nbsp;To implement the I Am Vanessa Guillén Act, I also issued an Executive Order to add sexual harassment as a specific offense under the Uniform Code of Military Justice.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was proud to support and sign into law the Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act of 2021.&nbsp; This law advances efforts to prevent and address sexual harassment and sexual assault and promotes access to justice by guaranteeing that people who have experienced sexual assault and sexual harassment in the workplace are not forced into binding arbitration and are instead allowed to choose whether to go to court.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ending violence against women and eliminating sexual assault has been a priority for me throughout my life.&nbsp; It is why I wrote and championed the original Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), a law that has transformed how we respond to sexual assault and which I count as one of my proudest legislative accomplishments.&nbsp; I am proud to have recently signed into law the reauthorization of VAWA, which expands prevention efforts and protections for survivors of sexual assault and other forms of gender-based violence. &nbsp;The law will provide increased resources and training so that our law enforcement and our judicial systems are better able to appropriately handle these cases.&nbsp; It&nbsp;includes a new focus on addressing technology-facilitated abuse and establishes a Federal civil cause of action for victims of non-consensual distribution of intimate images.&nbsp; The&nbsp;Act will strengthen rape prevention and education efforts, support rape crisis centers, improve the training of sexual assault forensic examiners, reduce the backlog of untested DNA kits, and broaden access to legal services for all survivors.&nbsp; It will also expand recognition of the special criminal jurisdiction of Tribal courts to cover non-Native perpetrators of sexual assault, sex trafficking, child abuse, and stalking.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This month, we honor the bravery and leadership of survivors by rededicating ourselves to eliminating sexual violence.&nbsp; It will require care and commitment from each of us to realize an America where everyone is free from the threat and impact of sexual violence.</p>



<p>     NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 2022 as National Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month.  I urge all Americans to support sexual assault survivors including when survivors reach out and disclose abuse.</p>



<p>     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-sixth.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-right">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>Every child deserves to live in a safe and loving household; yet, for hundreds of thousands of children across our Nation, abuse and neglect are a tragic reality.&nbsp; During National Child Abuse Prevention Month, our country stands as one to condemn and combat child abuse in all of its forms &#8212; including physical, emotional, and sexual abuse, as well as online sexual exploitation; we raise awareness about the risk factors that can lead to child abuse and neglect; and we highlight the importance of supporting families to prevent child maltreatment.&nbsp; As a Nation, we must work together to prevent and address child abuse and ensure that every child can grow up in a safe environment and live a happy, prosperous life.</p>



<p><strong>   </strong>  Child abuse crosses all socioeconomic and educational levels, religions, and ethnic and cultural backgrounds.  We know that abuse and neglect negatively impact every aspect and stage of a child&#8217;s life.  Child abuse impacts the ability of students to succeed in school and often hinders their ability to forge healthy relationships with their loved ones and peers.  It is associated with involvement in the juvenile justice system, especially for girls who have experienced sexual abuse.  One of the most important tools to break the cycle and eliminate the tragedy of child abuse and neglect is prevention.  This requires that we support and uplift our communities, families, and individuals so that our children can be raised in safe, loving, and healthy environments.  For those children and adolescents who do experience abuse, it is important to ensure access to trauma-informed services and healing.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to help prevent child abuse and neglect, my Administration is committed to providing high-quality and equitable support to all families that need it.&nbsp; The American Rescue Plan provided cash assistance to millions of working families and expanded the Child Tax Credit &#8212; which lifted millions of children and families out of poverty.&nbsp; It supplied critical funding to support State and community child abuse prevention and response efforts and authorized an additional $250 million for community-based child abuse prevention programs. &nbsp;This additional funding has allowed communities to address the complex structural issues that contribute to families becoming involved in the child welfare system.&nbsp; At a&nbsp;time when families are experiencing elevated hardships, especially vulnerable families that have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19, this extra support is more important than ever. &nbsp;Also, I was proud to sign into law a bill to help sustain the Crime Victims Fund, which provides assistance for child advocacy centers and other programs to address child abuse.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was raised to believe that one of the greatest sins is the abuse of power, and there is no greater abuse of power than the abuse of a child. &nbsp;National Child Abuse Prevention Month is an opportunity to take bold action to better support parents and caregivers with access to resources to cope during challenging times.&nbsp; It is also a time to identify and take the necessary steps to address inequities experienced by those who have been historically underserved and adversely affected by continuous poverty and inequality.&nbsp; Reducing child poverty is critical to&nbsp;reducing the disproportional representation of low-income children and families &#8212; especially communities of color &#8212; in&nbsp;the child welfare system and foster care.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Nation is also witnessing a cynical and dangerous campaign waged by some elected leaders who are attempting to weaponize the child welfare system against families just because they love and affirm their transgender children. &nbsp;These leaders have sought to direct child abuse investigations into families simply because they have provided access to affirming care for their children. &nbsp;These discriminatory actions threaten to hurt our Nation&#8217;s children and must stop.&nbsp; Affirming a transgender child&#8217;s identity is one of the best things that a parent, teacher, or doctor can do to keep children from harm. &nbsp;My Administration will continue to take actions to keep transgender children and their families safe. &nbsp;That is why the Department of Health and Human Services recently released new guidance to State child welfare agencies on how they can support and affirm LGBTQI+ children who are in foster care.</p>



<p>     During National Child Abuse Prevention Month and throughout the year, I call upon everyone to stand together against child abuse and neglect and show our appreciation of the hardworking child-welfare workforce and allies who are steadfast in their commitment to strengthening families, protecting children, and combating systemic inequities.  For more information on how professionals and communities are supporting families and to learn strategies to advance equity in child abuse prevention programs, please view the 2021/2022 Prevention Resource Guide, available at childwelfare.gov.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in&nbsp;me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do&nbsp;hereby proclaim April 2022 as National Child Abuse Prevention Month.&nbsp; I call upon all Americans to observe this month by joining together as a Nation to promote the safety and well-being of all children and families and to recognize the child-welfare workforce and allies who work tirelessly to protect our children. &nbsp;And we honor the strength and resilience of adult survivors of child abuse.</p>



<p>     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-sixth.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-right">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.</p>

<p>    Since the Congress passed the landmark National Cancer Act in 1971, our Nation has made tremendous strides in preventing, detecting, and treating cancer.  But nearly all families &#8211;including my own and that of the Vice President&#8217;s &#8212; still know the pain a cancer diagnosis brings.  Despite our Nation&#8217;s progress over the last 50 years, cancer in its many forms is still the second leading cause of death in the United States, with more than 600,000 deaths and nearly 1.9 million new cancer diagnoses each year.  A cancer diagnosis remains a crushing blow to those diagnosed, as well as their loved ones.  In the name of all those we have lost and for all those still fighting, I believe we can end cancer as we know it.  <br><br>     During National Cancer Control Month, we renew our commitments to improve cancer prevention, promote early detection, enhance treatment, and support the needs of cancer patients, survivors, and caregivers.  We recognize that while the fight against cancer is often personal, the desire to make cancer more preventable, detectable, and treatable is one that has the potential to unite us as a Nation, inspiring us to stand together and work together.  <br><br>     In 2016, as Vice President, I led the Cancer Moonshot to accelerate our progress against cancer and take advantage of 21st century science and technology &#8212; an effort that has catalyzed change across the cancer community.  As President, I have reignited the Cancer Moonshot and set ambitious new goals to reduce the death rate from cancer by 50 percent over the next 25 years and to improve the experience of people and their families living with and surviving cancer.  We are creating the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H), with the singular purpose of expediting breakthroughs in the prevention, detection, and treatment of cancer and other deadly diseases.  <br><br>     As part of a recommitment to the Cancer Moonshot, the First Lady and I announced a call to action on cancer screening and early detection.  Our goal is to drive progress on potentially life-saving screenings that so many Americans have missed as a result of the pandemic and to help ensure that everyone in the United States benefits equitably from the technology we have to detect, diagnose, and treat cancer.  We urge every American to get back on track with their recommended screenings, and we implore the public and private sectors to increase access to early detection for individuals and communities.  To learn more about which cancer screenings are appropriate for you, talk to your healthcare provider, visit <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/dcpc/prevention/screening.htm">cdc.gov/cancerscreening</a> or <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/screening/screening-tests">cancer.gov/screeningtests</a>, or call 1-800-4-CANCER. <br><br>     We also encourage Americans to take the proven steps to lower their risk for many forms of cancer.  Experts agree that reducing tobacco use, eating healthily, engaging in regular physical activity and exercise, limiting alcohol consumption, and reducing exposure to the sun when it is at its peak can help reduce the risk of a cancer diagnosis.  Given that cigarette smoking is responsible for 30 percent of all cancer deaths, helping people quit smoking and limiting exposure to secondhand smoke can save lives.  Resources are available at <a href="http://www.smokefree.gov/">SmokeFree.gov</a>, by calling 1-800-QUIT-NOW, or by texting QUITNOW to 333888. <br><br>     Access to health coverage is critical to the fight against cancer, and we were proud to expand access to quality, affordable coverage through the American Rescue Plan.  Most health insurance plans are required to cover recommended cancer screenings with no out-of-pocket costs.  But for millions of Americans, the care they need is not within reach.  That is why I am committed to reducing prescription drug costs and health insurance premiums for millions of Americans and closing the Medicaid coverage gap in States that refuse to expand Medicaid.  This would allow millions more of our fellow Americans to access cancer screenings and tobacco cessation services.  <br><br>     We also thank the doctors, nurses, researchers, caregivers, and advocates who are dedicated to finding treatments and cures and reducing the pain and burden of cancer.  Our Nation&#8217;s health care workers continued to provide care and support to cancer patients and their loved ones, even as a global pandemic made their jobs more difficult and demanding, and our Nation is forever grateful.  <br><br>    During Cancer Control Month, we reaffirm our national commitment to meet the scourge of cancer with urgency and with all the tools and talent we can bring to bear.  For survivors and caregivers who carry the physical and mental scars of cancer treatment and recovery, for those who we have lost, and for those who we can save &#8212; let us end cancer as we know it. <br><br>     NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim April 2022 as National Cancer Control Month.  I encourage citizens, government agencies, private businesses, nonprofit organizations, and other interested groups to join in activities that will increase awareness of what Americans can do to prevent, detect, treat, and control cancer.<br><br>     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-sixth.<br></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>Today, more than 100,000 men, women, and children in the United States need a life-saving organ transplant.  In many cases, an organ donation provides another chance to live a full life.  For those waiting for that gift of life &#8212; the uncertainty can be excruciating, exacting a physical and emotional toll on the potential recipient and their loved ones.  During National Donate Life Month, we give thanks to the families and friends of donors who have supported their loved one&#8217;s decision to save lives by donating; we show our appreciation for the professionals who serve the transplantation community; and we encourage Americans who can to become organ, eye, tissue, marrow, and blood donors.  In so doing, we honor those who have given this most extraordinary of gifts.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last year, because of the charity and generosity of the American people, our Nation&#8217;s transplant experts performed more than 41,000 organ transplants &#8212; a record number. &nbsp;We saw organ donations from deceased donors set an annual record for the 11th consecutive year. &nbsp;Living donor transplants, which decreased significantly in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, increased with over 6,500 living donor transplants performed.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite our progress, our Nation continues to face a critical shortage of organ donors, and the number of people in need of a transplant is high, with 17 people dying every day while waiting for a transplant.&nbsp; Today&#8217;s transplant waitlist also includes more than 1,900 children under the age of 18 awaiting the gift of life.&nbsp; That is why during National Donate Life Month, we also recognize National Pediatric Transplant Week&nbsp;from April 24-30, a period dedicated to ending the pediatric transplant waiting list.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Waitlist data shows that people of color make up nearly 60&nbsp;percent of individuals awaiting an organ transplant. &nbsp;To increase access to transplantation for everyone, we recommit to promoting greater diversity in organ donation, as we continue to advance health equity for all communities, including those that have gone underserved, across our Nation.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every year, nearly 18,000 people in America are diagnosed with life-threatening blood cancers or other diseases for which a blood stem cell transplant may be their best or only hope for a cure.&nbsp; Approximately 70 percent of these individuals need donors from outside their families. &nbsp;Although nearly 23 million adults in the United States are currently registered as blood stem cell donors, we need more registrants to help the many individuals who still have difficulty finding a suitably matched donor.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During National Donate Life Month, we thank the millions of&nbsp;individuals across America who are living or registered organ donors.&nbsp; We recognize and commend the researchers, advocates, volunteers, and medical professionals working to reduce the number of people awaiting vital organ transplants.&nbsp; Our Nation applauds the therapeutic innovations that have decreased rates of organ rejection and have extended the lifespan of transplanted organs.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While transplantation continues to increase substantially and meet the needs of many people with organ failure, we must continue our efforts to shorten the waiting list and encourage organ donation. &nbsp;If you have not signed up as an organ donor, we&nbsp;can use your help.&nbsp; I encourage every American to help people in&nbsp;need by visiting <a href="https://www.organdonor.gov/sign-up">organdonor.gov</a> for organ, eye, and tissue donation, and <a href="https://bloodstemcell.hrsa.gov/">bloodstemcell.hrsa.gov</a> for marrow and blood donation.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the&nbsp;United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the&nbsp;Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 2022 as National Donate Life Month.&nbsp; I call upon every person who can to share the gift of life and hope by becoming organ, eye, tissue, marrow, and blood donors.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this</p>



<p>thirty-first day of March, in the year of our Lord two&nbsp;thousand&nbsp;twenty-two, and of the Independence of the United&nbsp;States of&nbsp;America the two&nbsp;hundred and forty-sixth.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.</p>

<p>Each April, the Month of the Military Child provides a chance for us to recognize and thank the children of our service members and veterans. &nbsp;I have always believed that America has a sacred obligation to prepare our troops when we send them into harm&#8217;s way and to support them and their families both while they are deployed and after they return home.&nbsp; The First Lady and I recognize that it is not only those who wear the uniform that serve our country &#8212; it is also their loved ones, and especially their children.&nbsp; In the timeless words of the poet John Milton, &#8220;They also serve who only stand and wait.&#8221;<br><br>Military-connected children shoulder the burdens of service, facing unique challenges from a young age. &nbsp;They move frequently with their families &#8212; leaving friends, schools, and communities behind. &nbsp;They say goodbye to deploying family members, not knowing when they will see them again.&nbsp; Some of these young people endure deployments and separations, spending months or even years away from their beloved parent. &nbsp;Birthdays, holidays, graduations, and other important milestones are celebrated with just a phone call or virtual hug. &nbsp;The First Lady and I witnessed these sacrifices firsthand, when our grandchildren experienced their father&#8217;s deployment to Iraq.<br><br>Even after their parent has left the military, children can continue to face challenges as their parent transitions to civilian life and they may be called on to care for wounds or injuries their parent suffered during their service. &nbsp;Too many live with the pain and loss of a parent or family member who made the ultimate sacrifice in service to our country.<br><br>This month &#8212; and every month &#8212; we share our gratitude for these children. &nbsp;We recognize the hardships they face and commit to supporting the physical, social, and emotional health and safety of their families. &nbsp;That is why the White House&#8217;s Joining Forces initiative, guided by the First Lady, is focused on supporting the military and veteran families, caregivers, and survivors. &nbsp;<br><br>As a symbol of our support and gratitude to our military children, during the Month of the Military Child, the Department of Defense uses the color purple &#8212; representing all services in the military community. &nbsp;I encourage Americans everywhere to find ways to support our military-connected children, including by wearing purple to honor their service.&nbsp; Let us recommit ourselves to our sacred obligation to provide our military children and their families with the full support of our communities and our Government.<br><br>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 2022 as the Month of the Military Child. &nbsp;I call upon the people of the United States to honor military children with appropriate ceremonies and activities.<br><br>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of March, in the year of our Lord two&nbsp;thousand&nbsp;twenty-two, and of the Independence of the United&nbsp;States of&nbsp;America the two&nbsp;hundred and forty-sixth.<br>&nbsp;<br></p>

<p>MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF ENERGY<br> <br>SUBJECT:        Finding of a Severe Energy Supply Interruption</p>



<p>The Russian Federation&#8217;s unjustified, unprovoked, and unconscionable war against Ukraine, including its further invasion in violation of international law and its ongoing destructive military campaign across Ukraine, has had a profound impact on global oil markets.  On March 1, 2022, the International Energy Agency Governing Board agreed to a collective release of petroleum reserves and the United States committed to a drawdown and sale of 30 million barrels from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.  Since that time, the Russian Federation has escalated its attacks across broad swaths of Ukrainian territory and has devastated the civilian population.  The United States and its allies have imposed sanctions on the Russian Federation&#8217;s economy and financial system.  Public recognition of the gravity of the Russian Federation&#8217;s actions has precipitated a significant reduction in international economic engagement with Russian businesses, including with respect to transactions not currently subject to sanctions.<br><br>Based on information from and advice of the Secretary of Energy (Secretary) and on other information, I find and determine, in accordance with section 161(d) of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA), 42 U.S.C. 6241(d), that a drawdown and sale of petroleum from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) is required by a severe energy supply interruption, as defined in 42 U.S.C. 6202(8), on the basis that there is a national energy supply shortage that:<br><br>     (A)  is, or is likely to be, of significant scope and duration, and of an emergency nature;<br><br>     (B)  may cause major adverse impact on national safety or the national economy; and<br><br>     (C)  results, or is likely to result, from an interruption in the supply of imported petroleum products.<br><br>For these reasons, the Secretary is authorized and directed to draw down and sell petroleum from the SPR at public sale to the highest qualified bidder at a rate the Secretary may determine, in accordance with section 161 of EPCA and the SPR competitive sales procedures in 10 CFR Part 625.  If the Secretary determines the circumstances leading to this finding no longer support initiation or continuation of a drawdown and sale of petroleum from the SPR, the Secretary is authorized to cancel in whole or in part any offer to sell petroleum as a part of any drawdown and sale pursuant to this finding. <br></p>

<p class="has-text-align-right">Presidential Determination<br>No.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2022-11</p>



<p>MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE<br><br>SUBJECT:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Presidential Determination Pursuant to Section 303 of the Defense Production Act&nbsp;of 1950, as amended<br><br>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section&nbsp;303 of the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended (the &#8220;Act&#8221;) (50 U.S.C. 4533), it is hereby ordered:<br><br>Section 1.&nbsp; Policy.&nbsp; It is the policy of my Administration that ensuring a robust, resilient, sustainable, and environmentally responsible domestic industrial base to meet the requirements of the clean energy economy, such as the production of large-capacity batteries, is essential to our national security and the development and preservation of domestic critical infrastructure.<br><br>The United States depends on unreliable foreign sources for many of the strategic and critical materials necessary for the clean energy transition &#8212; such as lithium, nickel, cobalt, graphite, and manganese for large-capacity batteries.&nbsp; Demand for such materials is projected to increase exponentially as the world transitions to a clean energy economy.<br><br>To promote the national defense, the United States must secure a reliable and sustainable supply of such strategic and critical materials. &nbsp;The United States shall, to the extent consistent with the promotion of the national defense, secure the supply of such materials through environmentally responsible domestic mining and processing; recycling and reuse; and recovery from unconventional and secondary sources, such as mine waste.</p>



<p>These actions shall be conducted, to the extent consistent with the promotion of the national defense and applicable law, with strong environmental, sustainability, safety, labor, Tribal consultation, and impacted community engagement standards, to rebuild and maintain American expertise and productive capacity in these critical sectors.<br><br>Sec. 2.&nbsp; Determination.&nbsp; (a) &nbsp;I hereby determine, pursuant to section 303(a)(5) of the Act, that:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(1) &nbsp;sustainable and responsible domestic mining, beneficiation, and value-added processing of strategic and critical materials for the production of large-capacity batteries for the automotive, e-mobility, and stationary storage sectors are essential to the national defense;<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(2) &nbsp;without Presidential action under section 303 of the Act, United States industry cannot reasonably be expected to provide the capability for these needed industrial resources, materials, or critical technology items in a timely manner; and<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(3) &nbsp;purchases, purchase commitments, or other action pursuant to section 303 of the Act are the most cost-effective, expedient, and practical alternative method for meeting the need.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(b) &nbsp;Consistent with section 303(a)(1) of the Act, the Secretary of Defense shall create, maintain, protect, expand, or restore sustainable and responsible domestic production capabilities of such strategic and critical materials by supporting feasibility studies for mature mining, beneficiation, and value-added processing projects; by-product and co-product production at existing mining, mine waste reclamation, and other industrial facilities; mining, beneficiation, and value-added processing modernization to increase productivity, environmental sustainability, and workforce safety; and any other such activities authorized under section 303(a)(1) of the Act.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(c) &nbsp;In the execution of projects to create, maintain, protect, expand, or restore sustainable and responsible domestic production capabilities of such strategic and critical materials consistent with section 303(a)(1) of the Act, the Secretary of Defense shall consult with the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary of Energy, and the heads of other executive departments and agencies (agencies) as appropriate.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(d) &nbsp;Further, pursuant to section 303(a)(7)(B) of the Act, I find that action to expand the domestic production capabilities for such strategic and critical materials is necessary to avert an industrial resource or critical technology item shortfall that would severely impair the national defense capability. &nbsp;Therefore, I waive the requirements of section&nbsp;303(a)(1)–(a)(6) of the Act for the purpose of expanding the sustainable and responsible domestic mining, beneficiation, and value-added processing of strategic and critical materials necessary for the production of large-capacity batteries for the automotive, e-mobility, and stationary storage sectors.<br><br>Sec. 3. &nbsp;Annual Report to the President and the Congress by the Secretary of Defense. &nbsp;(a)&nbsp; The Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the heads of other agencies as appropriate, shall conduct a survey of the domestic industrial base for the mining, beneficiation, and value-added processing of strategic and critical materials for the production of large-capacity batteries for the automotive, e-mobility, and stationary storage sectors. &nbsp;Such survey shall assess whether conditions continue to warrant the use of the authority under section 303 of the Act.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(b)&nbsp; Consistent with the designation under section 309 of Executive Order 13603 of March 16, 2012 (National Defense Resources Preparedness), the Secretary of Defense shall include the survey stated in section 3(a) of this determination in the annual report to the Congress required by section 304(f) of the Act, and also shall submit such report to the President.<br><br>Sec. 4.&nbsp; Limitations.&nbsp; Nothing in this determination shall be construed to waive or supersede the requirement for mines or other industrial facilities to comply with all Federal and State permitting requirements and environmental health and safety laws.<br><br>Sec. 5.&nbsp; General Provisions.&nbsp; (a)&nbsp; Nothing in this determination shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp; the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(ii)&nbsp; the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(b)&nbsp; This determination shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(c)&nbsp; This determination is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United&nbsp;States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(d)&nbsp; You are authorized and directed to publish this determination in the <em>Federal Register</em>.</p>
