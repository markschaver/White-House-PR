<p>Today, President Biden announced actions that his Administration is taking to protect women who will face the grave consequences of today’s Supreme Court decision. This decision expressly took away a Constitutional right from the American people that it had recognized for nearly 50 years – a woman’s right to choose, free from government interference.</p>



<p>This decision will have devastating consequences in the lives of women around the country.</p>



<p>The President made clear that the only way to secure a woman’s right to choose is for Congress to restore the protections of <em>Roe</em> as federal law. Until then, he has announced two actions the Administration is taking to protect women.</p>



<p><strong>Protecting the Right to Seek Medical Care</strong></p>



<p>As the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-merrick-b-garland-statement-supreme-court-ruling-dobbs-v-jackson-women-s#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThe%20Justice%20Department%20will%20use,civil%20rights%20of%20all%20Americans.%E2%80%9D">Attorney General made clear,</a> women must remain free to travel safely to another state to seek the care they need.</p>



<p>A person has the right to travel between states for whatever reason they want – it is no one else’s business – especially the government’s. If a woman lives in a state that restricts abortion, the Supreme Court’s decision does not prevent her from traveling from her home to a state that allows it.</p>



<p>If any state or local official tries to interfere with women exercising this basic right, the Biden Administration will fight that deeply un-American attack.</p>



<p><strong>Protecting Access to Medication</strong></p>



<p>The President directed the Secretary of Health and Human Services to protect women’s access to critical medications for reproductive health care that are approved by the Food and Drug Administration—including essential preventive health care like contraception and medication abortion.</p>



<p>More than 20 years ago, the FDA approved mifepristone to safely end an early pregnancy; this drug is also commonly used to treat miscarriages. The American Medical Association and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists wrote to President Biden and Vice President Harris, asking the federal government to protect access to this care. In the face of threats from state officials saying they will try to ban or severely restrict access to medication for reproductive health care, the President directed the Secretary of Health and Human Services to identify all ways to ensure that mifepristone is as widely accessible as possible in light of the FDA’s determination that the drug is safe and effective—including when prescribed through telehealth and sent by mail.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Cross Hall</p>



<p>12:37 P.M. EDT</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Today is a &#8212; it’s not hyperbole to suggest a very solemn moment.&nbsp; Today, the Supreme Court of the United States expressly took away a constitutional right from the American people that it had already recognized.</p>



<p>They didn’t limit it.&nbsp; They simply took it away.&nbsp; That’s never been done to a right so important to so many Americans.</p>



<p>But they did it.&nbsp; And it’s a sad day for the Court and for the country.</p>



<p>Fifty years ago, Roe v. Wade was decided and has been the law of the land since then.</p>



<p>This landmark case protected a woman’s right to choose, her right to make intensely personal decisions with her doctor, free from the inter- &#8212; from interference of politics.</p>



<p>It reaffirmed basic principles of equality &#8212; that women have the power to control their own destiny.&nbsp; And it reinforced the fundamental right of privacy &#8212; the right of each of us to choose how to live our lives.</p>



<p>Now, with Roe gone, let’s be very clear: The health and life of women in this nation are now at risk.</p>



<p>As Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, as Vice President and now as President of the United States, I’ve studied this case carefully.&nbsp; I’ve overseen more Supreme Court confirmations than anyone today, where this case was always discussed.</p>



<p>I believe Roe v. Wade was the correct decision as a matter of constitutional law, an application of the fundamental right to privacy and liberty in matters of family and personal autonomy.</p>



<p>It was a decision on a complex matter that drew a careful balance between a woman’s right to choose earlier in her pregnancy and the state’s ability to regulate later in her pregnancy.&nbsp; A decision with broad national consensus that most Americans of faiths and backgrounds found acceptable and that had been the law of the land for most of the lifetime of Americans today.</p>



<p>And it was a constitutional principle upheld by justices appointed by Democrat and Republican Presidents alike.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Roe v. Wade was a 7 to 2 decision written by a justice appointed by a Republican President, Richard Nixon.  In the five decades that followed Roe v. Wade, justices appointed by Republican Presidents &#8212; from Eisenhower, Nixon, Reagan, George <s>W.</s> [H.W.] Bush &#8212; were among the justices who voted to uphold the principles set forth in Roe v. Wade.</p>



<p>It was three justices named by one President &#8212; Donald Trump &#8212; who were the core of today’s decision to upend the scales of justice and eliminate a fundamental right for women in this country.</p>



<p>Make no mistake: This decision is the culmination of a deliberate effort over decades to upset the balance of our law.&nbsp; It’s a realization of an extreme ideology and a tragic error by the Supreme Court, in my view.</p>



<p>The Court has done what it has never done before: expressly take away a constitutional right that is so fundamental to so many Americans that had already been recognized.</p>



<p>The Court’s decision to do so will have real and immediate consequences.&nbsp; State laws banning abortion are automatically taking effect today, jeopardizing the health of millions of women, some without exceptions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So extreme that women could be punished for protecting their health.</p>



<p>So extreme that women and girls who are forced to bear their rapist’s child &#8212; of the child of consequence.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s a &#8212; it just &#8212; it just stuns me.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So extreme that doctors will be criminalized for fulfilling their duty to care.</p>



<p>Imagine having &#8212; a young woman having to ch- &#8212; carry the child of incest &#8212; as a consequence of incest.&nbsp; No option.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Too often the case that poor women are going to be hit the hardest.&nbsp; It’s cruel.</p>



<p>In fact, the Court laid out state laws criminalizing abortion that go back to the 1800s as rationale &#8212; the Court literally taking America back 150 years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This a sad day for the country, in my view, but it doesn’t mean the fight is over.</p>



<p>Let me be very clear and unambiguous:&nbsp;The only way we can secure a woman’s right to choose and the balance that existed is for Congress to restore the protections of Roe v. Wade as federal law.</p>



<p>No executive action from the President can do that.&nbsp; And if Congress, as it appears, lacks the vote &#8212; votes to do that now, voters need to make their voices heard.</p>



<p>This fall, we must elect more senators and representatives who will codify a woman’s right to choose into federal law once again, elect more state leaders to protect this right at the local level.</p>



<p>We need to restore the protections of Roe as law of the land.&nbsp; We need to elect officials who will do that.</p>



<p>This fall, Roe is on the ballot.&nbsp; Personal freedoms are on the ballot.&nbsp; The right to privacy, liberty, equality, they&#8217;re all on the ballot.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Until then, I will do all in my power to protect a woman’s right in states where they will face the consequences of today’s decision.</p>



<p>While the Court’s decision casts a dark shadow over a large swath of the land, many states in this country still recognize a woman’s right to choose.</p>



<p>So if a woman lives in a state that restricts abortion, the Supreme Court’s decision does not prevent her from traveling from her home state to the state that allows it.&nbsp; It does not prevent a doctor in that state &#8212; in that state from treating her.</p>



<p>As the Attorney General has made clear, women must remain free to travel safely to another state to seek the care they need.&nbsp; And my administration will defend that bedrock right.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If any state or local official, high or low, tries to interfere with a woman’s ex- &#8212; exercising her basic right to travel, I will do everything in my power to fight that deeply un-American attack.</p>



<p>My administration will also protect a woman’s access to medications that are approved by the Food and Drug Administration &#8212; the FDA &#8212; like contraception, which is essential for preventative healthcare; mifepristone, which the FDA approved 20 years ago to safely end early pregnancies and is commonly used to treat miscarriages.</p>



<p>Some states are saying that they’ll try to ban or severely restrict access to these medications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But extremist governors and state legislators who are looking to block the mail or search a person’s medicine cabinet or control a woman’s actions by tracking data on her apps she uses are wrong and extreme and out of touch with the majority of Americans.</p>



<p>The American Medical Association and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists wrote to me and Vice President Harris stressing that these laws are not based on &#8212; are not based on evidence and asking us to act to protect access to care.&nbsp; They say by limiting access to these medicines, maternal mortality will climb in America.&nbsp; That’s what they say.</p>



<p>Today, I’m directing the Department of Health and Human Services to take steps to ensure that these critical medications are available to the fullest extent possible and that politicians cannot interfere in the decisions that should be made between a woman and her doctor.&nbsp; And my administration will remain vigilant as the implications of this decision play out.</p>



<p>I’ve warned about how this decision risks the broader right to privacy for everyone.&nbsp; That’s because Roe recognized the fundamental right to privacy that has served as the basis for so many more rights that we have come to take &#8212; we’ve come to take for granted that are ingrained in the fabric of this country: the right to make the best decisions for your health; the right to use birth control &#8212; a married couple &#8212; in the privacy of their bedroom, for God’s sake; the right to marry the person you love.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, Justice Thomas said as much today.&nbsp; He explicitly called to reconsider the right of marriage equality, the right of couples to make their choices on contraception.&nbsp; This is an extreme and dangerous path the Court is now taking us on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let me close with two points.&nbsp;</p>



<p>First, I call on everyone, no matter how deeply they care about this decision, to keep all protests peaceful.&nbsp; Peaceful, peaceful, peaceful.&nbsp; No intimidation.&nbsp; Violence is never acceptable.&nbsp; Threats and intimidation are not speech.&nbsp; We must stand against violence in any form regardless of your rationale.</p>



<p>Second, I know so many of us are frustrated and disillusioned that the Court has taken something away that’s so fundamental.&nbsp; I know so many women are now going to face incredibly difficult situations.&nbsp; I hear you.&nbsp; I support you.&nbsp; I stand with you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The consequences and the consensus of the American people &#8212; core principles of equality, liberty, dignity, and the stability of the rule of law &#8212; demand that Roe should not have been overturned.</p>



<p>With this decision, the conservative majority of the Supreme Court shows how extreme it is, how far removed they are from the majority of this country.&nbsp; They have made the United States an outlier among developed nations in the world.&nbsp; But this decision must not be the final word.</p>



<p>My administration will use all of its appropriate lawful powers.&nbsp; But Congress must act.&nbsp; And with your vote, you can act.&nbsp; You can have the final word.&nbsp; This is not over.</p>



<p>Thank you very much.&nbsp; I’ll have more to say on this in weeks to come.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>Today, the White House released the Biden-Harris Administration’s  <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Maternal-Health-Blueprint.pdf">Blueprint for Addressing the Maternal Health Crisis</a>, a whole-of-government approach to combatting maternal mortality and morbidity. For far too many mothers, complications related to pregnancy, childbirth, and postpartum can lead to devastating health outcomes — including hundreds of deaths each year. This maternal health crisis is particularly devastating for Black women, Native women, and women in rural communities who all experience maternal mortality and morbidity at significantly higher rates than their white and urban counterparts.</p>



<p>Under President Biden and Vice President Harris’s leadership, this Administration is now taking the next step towards a future where the United States will be the best country in the world to have a baby. The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to cutting the rates of maternal mortality and morbidity, reducing the disparities in maternal health outcomes, and improving the overall experience during and after pregnancy for people across the country. This commitment will require bold, unprecedented action through a whole-of-government strategy.</p>



<p>To start, the Administration is calling on Congress to improve and expand coverage by closing the Medicaid coverage gap and requiring continuous Medicaid coverage for 12 months postpartum, as well as making the significant investments included in the President’s FY23 budget to reduce maternal morbidity and mortality.</p>



<p>The Administration also recognizes that addressing the maternal health crisis in the United States requires immediate action. That is why, in addition to urging Congressional action, the White House has mobilized over a dozen federal agencies to develop the White House Blueprint for Addressing the Maternal Health Crisis. The Blueprint outlines five priorities to improve maternal health and outcomes in the United States:</p>



<p>• Increasing access to and coverage of comprehensive high-quality maternal health services, including behavioral health services.<br>• Ensuring women giving birth are heard and are decisionmakers in accountable systems of care.<br>• Advancing data collection, standardization, harmonization, transparency, and research<br>• Expanding and diversifying the perinatal workforce.<br>• Strengthening economic and social supports for people before, during, and after pregnancy.</p>



<p><strong>For women who are pregnant, postpartum, or hoping to become pregnant, the actions in the Blueprint mean:</strong></p>



<p>• <strong>Extended Postpartum Coverage: </strong>States are encouraged to extend Medicaid coverage from two months to one year postpartum, so that women do not lose or have changes in their coverage during or soon after pregnancy.<br>• <strong>Investments in Rural Maternal Care: </strong>Rural health care facilities will have more staff and capabilities to provide maternal care through increased funding from the expanding the Rural Maternity and Obstetrics Management Strategies Program and more robust training for rural health care providers.<br>• <strong>A Maternal Mental Health Hotline: </strong>Providers will be trained on mental health during pregnancy, and women will have access to a national, confidential, 24-hour, toll-free hotline if they are experiencing mental health challenges.<br>• <strong>Substance Use Services: </strong>Federal agencies will partner with community-based organizations to ensure that addiction services and people trained in substance use disorder during pregnancy are more available.<br>• <strong>No More Surprise Bills: </strong>Through the No Surprises Act, women are now protected from certain unexpected medical bills, which may occur during pregnancy, postpartum care, and/or delivery.<br>• <strong>Better Trained Providers: </strong>More providers will be trained on implicit biases as well as culturally and linguistically appropriate care, so that more women are listened to, respected, and empowered as a decisionmaker in their own care.<br>• <strong>Improved Maternal Health Data: </strong>Through enhanced federal partnerships with state and local maternal health data collection entities, communities, hospitals, and researchers will have access to better data to they can analyze poor outcomes during pregnancy and make improvements to support healthy pregnancies.<br>• <strong>A More Diverse Maternal Care Workforce:</strong> Federal agencies will invest more in hiring, training, and deploying more physicians, certified nurse midwives, doulas, and community health workers to support women during pregnancy, delivery, and postpartum. The federal government will work to ensure these providers come from diverse communities and backgrounds.<br>• <strong>Better Access to Doulas and Midwives: </strong>The Administration will work with states to expand access to doulas and midwives, and encourage insurance companies to cover their services.<br>• <strong>Expanded Social Services: </strong>Stronger partnerships between the Departments of Housing and Urban Development, Agriculture, and Health and Human Services will help make it easier to enroll in federal programs for housing, food, childcare, and income assistance, as we know health care is only one part of what makes for a healthy pregnancy.<br>• <strong>Stronger Workplace Protections for Mothers: </strong>Federal agencies will promote greater awareness of workplace protections and accommodations for new parents, like access to a private lactation room and break time to pump.</p>



<p>The actions outlined in the Blueprint are just the latest in this Administration’s multi-year effort to combat maternal mortality and morbidity. Since taking office, the Biden-Harris Administration has taken significant steps to address the maternal health crisis in the United States, including:</p>



<p>• <strong>Extending Postpartum Medicaid Coverage. </strong>Through the American Rescue Plan, states now have an easier pathway to extend Medicaid coverage from two to twelve months postpartum. Currently, 14 states and the District of Columbia have availed themselves of this opportunity, extending coverage for more than 250,000 women.<br>• <strong>Announcing the New “Birthing Friendly” Hospitals Initiative. </strong>During the December Call to Action, the Vice President announced that, through the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, the Administration will be deploying a “Birthing Friendly” hospitals designation—the first federal hospital quality designation with a focus on maternal health.<br>• <strong>Hosting the First-Ever Meeting of Cabinet Officials on Maternal Health.</strong> In April of this year, Vice President Harris hosted the first-ever meeting of Cabinet officials to discuss maternal health. This meeting brought together twelve agency leaders including leaders from the Departments of Health and Human Services, Defense, Veterans Affairs, Agriculture, and Housing and Urban Development to discuss ways that this Administration could deploy the resources of the federal government to tackle maternal mortality and morbidity.<br>• <strong>Leading the White House’s First-Ever Maternal Health Day of Action. </strong>In December 2021, the Vice President issued a nationwide Call to Action for federal agencies, businesses, and non-profits to collaboratively solve the maternal health crisis. During that event, the Vice President announced that this Administration had secured millions of dollars in private sector commitments aimed at improving maternal health.</p>



<p>As we continue taking bold action to confront the maternal mortality and morbidity crisis, we will continue to listen to people who are pregnant and new mothers and ensure their feedback informs our approach to improve maternal health and strengthen our health care system. With the support of all parts of government and society, we can make this vision a reality.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Surfside, Florida</p>



<p>Good morning. Hidden in crowds—scattered throughout workplaces, and grocery stores, and parks—there is a fellowship of loss. <br><br>To the uninitiated, we look normal, average, whole. But like a secret handshake, I can spot them—by the sadness that rests at the corner of their smile. By the curve of their shoulders, as if they can still feel the small arms of a child wrapping around their neck. <br><br>And though we are strangers, we know untellable truths about one another: That we will spend the rest of our lives longing for a face that’s gone forever—and that when they left our world, they took a light inside of us with them. <br><br>There are some who might say that the hurt fades over time. But we know that’s not true. There is a collapsed star spinning inside of us, and we will forever live in its gravity. <br><br>The things we carry are heavier now. And one year later—or many years later—our knees sometimes buckle beneath the weight of our grief. <br><br>Still, we have discovered moments of grace too. Somehow, and against all odds, we rise from the floor. We find a fortitude that we didn’t know we had—and we reach out for help. We realize that we’re not alone. <br><br>Today, we gather to remember the 98 people lost. <br><br>On behalf of my husband, President Biden, whose heart and prayers have never left this community, we stand with you today and always. And as we gather, we express gratitude for this community: <br><br>The fire fighters and other first responders who bound up wounds and spent weeks working to recover your loved ones.<br><br>The members of Surfside who came together to embrace you—who prayed for you every night, and wrapped their arms around you.<br><br>The Americans from across our country who donated and found ways to spread kindness.<br><br>We honor the light you found in each other—a fellowship you never wanted to be a part of, but draw strength from just the same. <br><br>If there is something strong enough to help us carry the burden of grief forward—something able to break its gravitational pull—it’s love. <br><br>The love that makes us tell that story one more time, that makes us laugh with tears in our eyes, and knows a part of them is still inside of us, even though they left before we were done needing them. <br><br>The love of the friends and family who refuse to leave us alone, who remind us that joy can be found even in sorrow. <br><br>The love of a community that lifts us when we’re weak—that carries us. <br><br>Take it one breath at a time. We are praying for you and grieving with you. <br><br>God bless you. </p>

<p>This bipartisan legislation will help protect Americans. Kids in schools and communities will be safer because of it. The House of Representatives should promptly vote on this bipartisan bill and send it to my desk.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">West Palm Beach, Florida</p>



<p><br>Thank you,&nbsp;Liliana.</p>



<p>No one should have to fight so hard just to get the treatments they need. No one should have to lose so much to save their own life.</p>



<p>We’ve made incredible progress to get people care—but your work ensures women don’t have to face this alone. Thank you. </p>



<p>Nancy, you’ve&nbsp;changed&nbsp;lives and you’ve&nbsp;saved&nbsp;them.&nbsp;And&nbsp;I’m so grateful for your partnership and friendship.&nbsp;It’s wonderful&nbsp;to learn more about the Promise&nbsp;Fund of Florida&nbsp;program.</p>



<p>Deputy Secretary Palm, thank you for your leadership at HHS.</p>



<p>And Representative Frankel—and all the elected officials with us today—we’re so glad to have you here. </p>



<p>Certain words have the power to make time stop.&nbsp;Malignant.&nbsp;Aggressive.&nbsp;Terminal.&nbsp;Cancer.</p>



<p>Like a spell,&nbsp;they&nbsp;still&nbsp;the air around us—frozen in place,&nbsp;we feel&nbsp;the&nbsp;world&nbsp;we knew slipping&nbsp;away.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And when the&nbsp;hands of the&nbsp;clock&nbsp;begin to move once again,&nbsp;we are not the person we once were,&nbsp;but someone&nbsp;changed:</p>



<p>A mother imagining all of the things she might not be there to teach her daughters.</p>



<p>A husband wondering how he will&nbsp;juggle chemotherapy appointments with work and child care.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A&nbsp;son trying to be strong for the parents who&nbsp;could&nbsp;outlive him.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cancer&nbsp;changes&nbsp;everyone it touches.&nbsp;And in some ways,&nbsp;it&nbsp;touches us all.</p>



<p>Like Nancy, I&nbsp;was drawn to this work because I lost someone to breast cancer&nbsp;almost thirty years ago—a&nbsp;dear friend&nbsp;named Winnie.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And in the decades since, I’ve met countless families who have faced this loss. </p>



<p>Before they say a word, I know exactly what they’ve been through—the ache of sitting bedside and watching someone you love seem to fade away, the shattering devastation of having your prayers go unanswered.</p>



<p>Or I see those who have walked through the fire and come out on the other side. </p>



<p>It’s subtle—the way they carry their shoulders, the lift of a chin—but it’s there: the hard-won strength of a survivor.  </p>



<p>They don’t come from one state or area.&nbsp;This disease doesn’t care who you vote for.</p>



<p>It’s not a red or blue issue.&nbsp;It’s an&nbsp;American&nbsp;issue.&nbsp;It’s a global issue.&nbsp;And it will take&nbsp;all of us&nbsp;to end cancer as we know it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have to bring to the table the brightest minds and fiercest hearts&nbsp;to learn,&nbsp;and collaborate,&nbsp;and discover&nbsp;together.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s why Joe and I reignited the Cancer Moonshot—and why it’s a key pillar of his Unity Agenda.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have an ambitious goal to reduce the death rate&nbsp;from cancer by at least half over the next 25 years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’re making sure that all Americans—no matter their background—have equal access to cancer diagnostics,&nbsp;therapeutics,&nbsp;clinical trials.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’ve created a cancer cabinet to bring our entire&nbsp;government together around this cause.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And we’re investing in the newest treatments and therapies.</p>



<p>While those who are touched by cancer come from all walks of life,&nbsp;they often share a similar story.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Survivors&nbsp;tell me&nbsp;that&nbsp;they wish they had found their diagnosis sooner.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Families say how difficult it can be to understand&nbsp;treatment plans or advocate for their loved ones.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And those are the issues where I’m focusing my efforts:&nbsp;increasing&nbsp;early detection and screenings,&nbsp;and&nbsp;improving the&nbsp;patient,&nbsp;family,&nbsp;and caregiver&nbsp;experience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over the last year and a half,&nbsp;I’ve traveled across the country—and even the world—to learn about innovative programs and partnerships that are making progress in these areas.&nbsp;And there is so much hope to be found.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Promise Fund is&nbsp;an incredible&nbsp;example&nbsp;of that hope.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We just came from&nbsp;FoundCare—a clinic up the road.&nbsp;With&nbsp;the Promise Fund’s help, they have&nbsp;made mammograms not only affordable and accessible,&nbsp;but easy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And as Nancy said,&nbsp;so many other clinics in this area are&nbsp;finding new ways to serve women,&nbsp;thanks to the Promise Fund’s help.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You know, Nancy, you’ve been a pioneer in this field for decades. </p>



<p>But one of the things I admire most about you is how you listen to women and adapt your strategy. </p>



<p>You saw a need here—where women weren’t able to get care because they struggled to find child care or transportation. </p>



<p>And you found a way to meet that need. So thank you once again for your leadership. </p>



<p>And thank you to all of the patient navigators who do that critical work. </p>



<p>Because of all of you, patients and their families know that they don’t have to do this alone. </p>



<p>Yes, cancer&nbsp;has the power to&nbsp;change us.&nbsp;But it connects us as well.&nbsp;It forces us to reach out—for answers,&nbsp;for help,&nbsp;for healing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It tears away the things that divide us—reminding us that we need to fight this disease,&nbsp;not each other.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It inspires us to come together and find the common ground on which our future can be built.</p>



<p>For Joe and me,&nbsp;this is the mission of our lives.&nbsp;And we are ready and proud to work beside you.</p>



<p>And now, I’d like to ask Nancy and our patient navigators to come join us on stage.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-left">Today, Vice President Kamala Harris convened Attorneys General from seven states to discuss the fight for reproductive rights. The roundtable followed recent meetings about reproductive rights that the Vice President held with health care providers, faith leaders, and constitutional law, privacy, and technology experts, and was part of the Administration’s work to build coalitions and preparedness in response to the attack on reproductive rights.<br>&nbsp;<br>The Vice President told the Attorneys General that they play a pivotal role in defending a woman’s right to make decisions about her own body. She spoke about how Attorneys General have a role in protecting the health, safety, and wellbeing of the women in their state — and as a result, can consider the various authorities they have to defend reproductive rights and freedoms, including access to abortion. The officials shared the steps they have taken so far to protect access to reproductive health care in their states, and they discussed their powers under their authority as their state’s chief legal officers.<br>&nbsp;<br>The Vice President thanked the Attorneys General for their leadership in safeguarding our nation’s most fundamental rights and freedoms.

<p class="has-text-align-center">Roosevelt Room</p>



<p>3:24 P.M. EDT</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; I want to say to the press: We have an impressive group of governors, labor leaders, and business leaders in the room here, but I&#8217;m not going to take the time to introduce everybody right now.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let me just say that &#8212; at the outset here &#8212; that &#8212; you know, Cabinet members, as well &#8212; that I think we&#8217;re at a place where we&#8217;re reaching an exciting point where it seems like there&#8217;s been a coalescence of notion that, you know, alternative energy makes sense, and wind is a gigantic piece of it.</p>



<p>I was in Colorado, and I actually &#8212; I never thought I&#8217;d see a blade for a windmill that was 102 yards long.&nbsp; And you could literally pick up the end of it, it was &#8212; I mean, the technology is changing so incredibly.</p>



<p>But look, you know, we&#8217;re going to deepen our partnership on offshore wind as well as climate overall, and create jobs &#8212; good jobs, union jobs.</p>



<p>And I apologize, I&#8217;m always talking about unions, but the reason I talk about it, not a joke, is because they have the single-most qualified workers in the world.&nbsp; I mean, they&#8217;re the best trained.&nbsp; They &#8212; it&#8217;s like going to college.&nbsp; You got a four-year apprenticeship.&nbsp; You know, you&#8217;re getting paid a little bit when you&#8217;re doing it, but it&#8217;s a lot of work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I just think it&#8217;s really, you know &#8212; you know, building trade jobs, steel jobs, manufacturing jobs.&nbsp; And, you know, it&#8217;s not just about the future, it&#8217;s about right now.</p>



<p>Listen, we&#8217;re &#8212; I think we&#8217;re &#8212; we&#8217;ve gone beyond &#8212; we&#8217;ve been talking about this a long time.&nbsp; We talked about this a long time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And in &#8212; the last administration tried to block offshore wind because they thought it might cause cancer.&nbsp; Not a joke. But they actually &#8212; that’s what the last guy said.&nbsp; But it had nothing to do with that.&nbsp; What it had to do with is they just didn&#8217;t want to invest in alternative energy.</p>



<p>And &#8212; and I might add &#8212; and I mean this sincerely &#8212; about labor: Before I &#8212; when I was running, I made sure to go to all the major labor unions and tell them what my environmental plan was and why.&nbsp; And when I think “climate,” when I think “environment,” I think “jobs.”&nbsp; Jobs.&nbsp; And this &#8212; these are good-paying jobs, and they&#8217;re making a big, big difference.</p>



<p>And my administration set bold targets to start with: 30 gigawatts by 2030.&nbsp; That’s 10 million homes.&nbsp; Ten million homes with offshore wind.&nbsp; Ports turned back into economic engines, being in a position where foundries and factories are up and running &#8212; again, creating jobs.&nbsp; And a more resilient grid, harnessing technologies like battery storage.<br><br>And, by the way, I know you all know it, but I &#8212; I’m not sure everybody in the country knows it: The technology is changing so rapidly on battery technology.&nbsp; It&#8217;s just astounding what I predict you&#8217;re going to see in the next 2 to 10 years &#8212; I mean, in terms of technological changes.<br><br>And this is a real boost for energy security.&nbsp; It really changes the creation of &#8212; and jobs, and it cuts consumer costs.<br><br>And we&#8217;ve approved more project, we&#8217;ve had record-setting lease sales, and we pushed the community investment project labor agreements and domestic in &#8212; and the domestic supply chains in ways that hasn&#8217;t occurred before.<br><br>We&#8217;ve shown that we’re both open for business and as &#8212; millions of private &#8212; have spent billions in private capital, like companies that are here around this table as well.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s been states who are doubling down, like the governors in this room and on the screen.&nbsp; And &#8212; and, together, you know, we&#8217;re stepping up, like union workers are in this room as well.<br><br>And, you know, I don&#8217;t think we could have had this meeting four years ago, fi- &#8212; not because of previous &#8212; I mean, it’s just so much has changed.&nbsp; There&#8217;s business, labor, governors, all coming together in ways that we weren&#8217;t before.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And &#8212; and so I just think that it&#8217;s meant workers and communities stepping up.&nbsp; And together, we&#8217;re about to build a better America.&nbsp; I really mean that &#8212; an even better America.<br><br>And I just wanted to stop by and thank everybody.&nbsp; And I might note what one of my staff members said earlier, before I &#8212; when I was, earlier in the afternoon, talking about this.&nbsp; And that is that we&#8217;re in a position where, you know, if you take a &#8212; do you have that &#8212; where is the staff that has that &#8212; that printout of the size of these &#8212; would you mind bringing it up to me?<br><br>(A document is handed to the President.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>This I show everybody I can, and you&#8217;ve all seen it.&nbsp; You &#8212; this table knows.&nbsp; When we’re talking about &#8212; this is the rendering of the Empire State Building.&nbsp; This is the Eiffel Tower.&nbsp; This is the average onshore turbine &#8212; 460 feet.&nbsp; This is the tallest onshore turbine &#8212; 540 feet.&nbsp; This is the new GE Haliade-X 835-foot offshore wind project on Block Island.&nbsp; Look how tall it is.&nbsp; Almost up &#8212; 853 feet.</p>



<p>And there&#8217;s a reason why this is important, as you all know, but I want the press to know &#8212; is that the wind that far out in the ocean is always blowing.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not like it&#8217;s just every once in a while, like you&#8217;d wait on shore, where we have to deal with battery storage, storing technology, et cetera.&nbsp; It&#8217;s always blowing.&nbsp; And it can produce as much energy as a coalmine, as much energy as an oil, you know, well &#8212; wells.&nbsp; I mean, it&#8217;s just &#8212; and it&#8217;s &#8212; and it&#8217;s clean, and it&#8217;s real, and it&#8217;s continuous.</p>



<p>And so I just want to thank you all for all you&#8217;re willing to do, and particularly the private companies who are stepping up here.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s big time.&nbsp; We’re stepping up, and we&#8217;re talking billions of dollars.&nbsp; We&#8217;re not just talking a little bit of money; we&#8217;re talking billions of dollars.&nbsp; And I think we&#8217;re going to get a lot done.</p>



<p>And I can&#8217;t tell you the last time I&#8217;ve been this excited about something we&#8217;re about to do, because I think we can change &#8212; literally begin to change the nature of how we generate industry &#8212; excuse me &#8212; generate energy.&nbsp; And the industry is stepping up.</p>



<p>And, by the way, I’m not &#8212; I’m going to get going too much.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Because I’m a little &#8212; I’m a little excited about it.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. President, are you disappointed in the gun decision?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Am I disappointed in the &#8212; well, I’ll answer this one question.&nbsp; And I was just talking to the Governor of New York about this.</p>



<p>I am disappointed in the Supreme Court gun decision.&nbsp; There is one little bit of solace.&nbsp; And the &#8212; the minority making up the majority opinion has laid out that it affects not every state; it affects only 40 states.&nbsp; A lot of states it affects.</p>



<p>And the phrase that I found noticeable was: There&#8217;s a difference between states that say “may” and say “shall.”&nbsp; If you have to say you “shall” give, you “shall” do ABC, they’re the ones that are going to have problems.&nbsp; But most say “may.”&nbsp; I mean, “may” &#8212; I got it reversed &#8212; “may” and “shall.”</p>



<p>And so there are &#8212; the gun laws in 40 of these states are still in place based on the decision.&nbsp; Not good enough, but it&#8217;s &#8212; I think it&#8217;s a bad decision.&nbsp; I think it&#8217;s &#8212; and I think it&#8217;s not reasoned accurately.&nbsp; But I&#8217;m disappointed.</p>



<p>Thank you. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Via Teleconference</p>



<p>2:40 P.M. EDT<br><br>DR. JHA:&nbsp; Good afternoon, everybody.&nbsp; My name is Ashish Jha, and I am the COVID-19 Response Coordinator for the White House.&nbsp;</p>



<p>First of all, apologies for the technical delays getting us started, but I am excited and delighted to get going this afternoon with two familiar faces, two colleagues who have been tirelessly battling the pandemic since the beginning of this pandemic more than two years ago.&nbsp; You know them both well: Dr. Rochelle Walensky and Tony Fauci.</p>



<p>Today, we want to update you on a really important topic, one that many parents and, really, America has waited for for a long time: the first COVID-19 vaccines for our youngest kids.&nbsp; You know, it&#8217;s been nearly 18 months since the first set of vaccines became available for adults.&nbsp; And just over the last week, we saw the FDA authorize and CDC recommend vaccines for children six months and above, for the first time.</p>



<p>Now, this is an important moment for families of kids under five, but it&#8217;s a historic moment for our nation, because essentially, every American, from our oldest to our youngest, is now eligible for the protection that vaccines provide.</p>



<p>Now, we know that these vaccines are extraordinarily safe and highly effective.&nbsp; Remember, after an extensive review by career FDA and CDC scientists, they were unanimously approved by an independent group of expert scientists.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, I like to remind people it&#8217;s hard to get a group of independent scientists agree on anything, and yet 21 independent scientists who serve on VRBPAC unanimously voted in agreement that the benefits of these vaccines clearly outweigh the risks.&nbsp; And then, 12 independent scientists that make up the a ACIP agreed, recommending these vaccines for kids six months and above.</p>



<p>Now, we have been, at HHS and in the administration, have been planning and preparing for this moment for a long time.&nbsp; When the President took office, he made a commitment that &#8212; to keep all families safe from COVID-19 across America.&nbsp; The availability of these vaccines brings us that much closer to that goal.</p>



<p>Now, to make sure that these vaccines get to the families that want them, we have launched a comprehensive effort with trusted partners.&nbsp; These partners include states, local health departments, pediatricians, family physicians, rural and community health centers, and pharmacies.&nbsp; In fact, our largest federal pharmacy partners &#8212; Walgreens, CVS, and Walmart &#8212; are stepping up and are already vaccinating children, as are many pediatricians across the country.</p>



<p>Now, as I have said to all of you on many occasions, we know this vaccination program will ramp up over time.&nbsp; Remember, vaccines could not be shipped until they were authorized by the FDA on Friday.&nbsp; As of today, I can report that more than 4 million doses have been delivered within days of authorization to approximately 13,000 sites across the country.&nbsp; And as more doses are received and more sites make those doses available, that information will also become available on Vaccines.gov.</p>



<p>Now, when you look at this vaccination program for our littlest Americans, it will feel a little different than the vaccination programs we&#8217;ve run before.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s because we know parents will be turning to their pediatricians and their family physicians.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have been guided in our approach by very clear data that says that most parents want to vaccinate their littlest ones in familiar settings.&nbsp; We also know that many parents have questions.&nbsp; And we want to encourage every physici- &#8212; I&#8217;m sorry &#8212; every parent to talk to their physician, to talk to the pediatrician, to talk to the family physician.</p>



<p>We also know that confidence in vaccines builds over time.&nbsp; And I remind people that at the start of the adult vaccination program back in December of 2020, only one in three adults said they were eager to get the shot.&nbsp; Today, nearly 90 percent of adults have gotten at least one shot.</p>



<p>We know the importance of working with trusted voices and community leaders, and we&#8217;re doing just that.&nbsp; HHS has partnered with over a thousand organizations, many of which work in minority and rural communities, organizations like the National Parent Teacher Association and the Cobb Institute of the National Medical Association.&nbsp; Both of them have been great partners.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve also started the COVID-19 Community Corps, an effort that has grown to include 17,000 members across healthcare, sports, rural, and faith organizations &#8212; organizations like Black Doctors for the COVID-19 Consortium and the National Indian Health Board.</p>



<p>Now, I want to address one issue that&#8217;s very important, and that is the issue of misinformation about vaccines and about kids and COVID in this pandemic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So let&#8217;s set the record straight, because the data here is actually quite clear: Kids are better protected if they are vaccinated.&nbsp; If they are vaccinated, they are far less likely to get seriously ill.&nbsp; They&#8217;re far less likely to end up in the hospital, far less likely to end up in the ICU.</p>



<p>Tens of millions of children in the U.S. and around the world have already been vaccinated against COVID.&nbsp; And the safety profile of these vaccines is extraordinary.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I have three children, all of whom have been vaccinated.&nbsp; In fact, every physician I know, including and particularly pediatricians, have all vaccinated their eligible children.</p>



<p>Now, we&#8217;ve come a long way in our fight against COVID-19, with vaccines and treatments and other tools, like testing that have become widely available.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I&#8217;m pleased to make another announcement today: The Biden-Harris administration is making more accessible tests available for individuals who are blind or visually impaired.&nbsp; These tests are available for free through COVIDTest.gov.</p>



<p>We developed this plan in close partnership with members of the disability community.&nbsp; An issue raised consistently was that individuals who are blind or low vision are often unable to utilize rapid self-tests on their own.&nbsp; The President has made clear he is committed to addressing the needs of individuals with disabilities regardless of where they live or the level of community transmission.&nbsp; Ensuring everyone has equitable access to COVID-19 testing and all other critical missio- &#8212; all other critical mitigation strategies is of the utmost importance.</p>



<p>So, in closing, the numbers in our fight against COVID-19 speak for themselves.&nbsp; Nearly three months after cases began to rise in the U.S., the deaths are actually down, and down 90 percent since the day the President took office.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; This has not happened randomly.&nbsp; Deaths are down because two out of three Americans are fully vaccinated, and half of them are boosted, because we have widespread availability of therapeutics like Paxlovid.<br><br>So, yes, we&#8217;ve made a lot of progress, but our job is not done.&nbsp; The pandemic is not over.&nbsp; And while we still have a lot of worth to &#8212; work to do, it is worth celebrating milestones.&nbsp;<br><br>And this week, as the littlest members of our society begin to get vaccinated, we need to take a moment and reflect on the good news that is.<br><br>All right, with that, I&#8217;m going to turn it over to Dr. Rochelle Walensky who will update us on the state of the pandemic and the importance of getting vaccinated &#8212; getting children vaccinated.<br><br>Over to you, Rochelle.</p>



<p>DR. WALENSKY:&nbsp; Thank you, Ashish.&nbsp; And good afternoon, everyone.&nbsp; As per my usual, I’d like to start by walking through the latest data.<br><br>So, our current seven-day daily average of cases is about 99,400.&nbsp; And that represents a decrease of about 4 percent over the prior week.<br><br>The seven-day average of hospital admissions is about 4,400 cases per day, which is an increase of about 2 percent over the prior week.<br><br>And as Dr. Jha noted, the seven-day average of daily deaths is about 250 per day, which is a decrease of about 16 percent over the prior week.<br><br>CDC does follow COVID-19 community levels, and that allows individuals and communities to take action to protect themselves and others based on their local community level.&nbsp; This also allows us to focus our efforts on protecting those who are most at risk of severe COVID-19 illness.<br><br>Last week, CDC reported 21 percent of the U.S. population was living in a high COVID-19 community level, and nearly 40 percent was living in a medium community level, and 39 percent was living in a low community level.<br><br>We will have updated COVID-19 community levels posted tonight, and we do anticipate things shifting among our communities across the country.&nbsp; So please go to CDC.gov where you can find your COVID-19 community level online.<br><br>As Dr. Jha noted, this past week, we&#8217;ve taken another important step forward in our fight against COVID-19.&nbsp; Following rigorous scientific review and a transparent and comprehensive discussion by ACIP on their immune response, safety, and ability of vaccines to protect children against disease, CDC expanded its COVID-19 vaccine recommendations to all children six months through five years of age.&nbsp; This makes nearly 20 million additional children eligible for vaccines.<br><br>I know there&#8217;s been a great deal of anticipation for parents surrounding the authorization and recommendation of COVID-19 vaccines for our youngest children.&nbsp; And for many, the opportunity to vaccinate their children comes as a welcome relief.<br><br>For those who may still be hesitant, I want to emphasize that COVID-19 vaccines have and continue to undergo the most intense safety monitoring in our history.<br><br>Parents, it is, of course, okay if you still have questions.&nbsp; And if you do, I encourage you to talk to your child&#8217;s provider or your local pharmacist to learn more about the benefits and, of course, the safety of these vaccines.<br><br>In the meantime, I&#8217;d like to outline why COVID-19 vaccinations for our children are particularly important.<br><br>We do know that COVID-19 illness can be serious for children and that, as parents, we are always looking to do what&#8217;s right to protect them against harm.<br><br>While we want to prevent severe outcomes for every age, it&#8217;s exper- &#8212; it&#8217;s especially concerning to see severe outcomes in our youngest children &#8212; the hospitalizations and deaths.&nbsp;<br><br>Children should not need to be hospitalized.&nbsp; They should not need to go to the ICU, to be on a ventilator, and they certainly should not lose their life to this virus at such a young age.<br><br>During the Omicron wave, we saw a huge spike in COVID-19 cases in children and the highest hospitalization rates in children than at any other point during this pandemic, especially among our youngest, ages six months through four years, who had the highest rate of hospitalization among any age group under the age of 17.<br><br>Since January 2020, we&#8217;ve lost 215 children &#8212; each six months to four years &#8212; to COVID-19.<br><br>To put that in perspective, during March 2020 through April 2022, COVID-19 was among the top five leading causes of death in every age group of children under the age of 19 and the number one infectious cause of death in children.<br><br>No parent should have to face the stress of having a child who&#8217;s severely ill.&nbsp; Protecting &#8212; protection gained from COVID-19 vaccination could be the difference between a hospitalization, a hospital &#8212; a hospital visit, or even che- &#8212; saving a child&#8217;s life.&nbsp;&nbsp; And that&#8217;s unequivocally great news for parents.<br><br>We all want to do what&#8217;s best for our children.&nbsp; And for the safest vaccine and protection against COVID-19, do go and get your child COVID-19 vaccinated.<br><br>Young children do not need to have an underlying condition to be at risk of severe disease.&nbsp; In fact, over half of children hospitalized with COVID-19 were otherwise healthy and had no underlying medical condition.&nbsp; And children who have previously had COVID-19 can also still benefit from a COVID-19 vaccine.&nbsp;<br><br>Evidence has shown that vaccine immunity results in a broader neutralizing antibody response that has broader protection against variants compared with infection-induced immunity alone.<br><br>So as a parent, as a physician, and as your CDC director, I strongly encourage all parents to get their child vaccinated.&nbsp;<br><br>Our fight against COVID-19 is not over, as Dr. Jha mentioned.&nbsp; But we are in a much better place.&nbsp; And we are now armed with vaccines for our very youngest, and we have the armamentarium in our toolbox to face this virus head on.<br><br>Thank you.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll now turn things over to Dr. Fauci.</p>



<p><br>DR. FAUCI:&nbsp; Thank you very much, Dr. Walensky.&nbsp; What I&#8217;d like to do over the next minute or two is to just underscore and answer preemptively some of the questions that Dr. Walensky and Dr. Jha and I have received over the last few days since the announcement was made.<br><br>Let&#8217;s just take a very quick review of the questions that people ask.&nbsp; For example, parents ask: How did they come to this conclusion?&nbsp; What was the data that led to the approval and recommendation of these drugs?&nbsp; Well, as you know &#8212; of these vaccines.<br><br>As you know, we have two in question &#8212; Moderna and Pfizer.&nbsp; Both of those have gone under extensive placebo, blinded control trials, which is the gold standard of determining efficacy and safety.<br><br>If we go first to the Moderna trial, it involves 6,400 children and infants.&nbsp; The important point to emphasize is that this is a vaccine which is two doses four weeks apart.&nbsp;<br><br>Importantly, the immune responses that were elicited by the vaccines were comparable to those responses in younger adults and in adults that were receiving a higher dose that unequivocally, in a clinical trial, led to a clinical benefit.&nbsp;<br><br>So even though this is mostly an immunological bridging study, the fact remains that it is highly correlated with a good clinical effect.<br><br>What about the safety of the Moderna?&nbsp; When you do vaccines, one of the things you address is what&#8217;s called reactogenicity.&nbsp; Namely, what&#8217;s the immediate local or systemic effect?<br><br>So in summary, and very briefly, the reactogenicity of this vaccine was essentially the same &#8212; no better or worse than what we’ve seen with any of a number of childhood vaccines that we regularly administer to our children.<br><br>There was no incidence of myocarditis or multisystem inflammatory syndrome of children.<br><br>Very quickly, moving on to the Pfizer, which was a bit different &#8212; it was in three doses.&nbsp; First doses separated by three weeks, second dose by eight weeks.<br><br>Again, the bridging immunological situation indicated that the responses that were elicited by this vaccine was equivalent to the responses in other studies, including young adults and in adults which were clearly associated with a beneficial clinical response.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With regard to the safety data of Pfizer BioNTech, the same thing: The reactogenicity &#8212; for example, fevers, pain at the site &#8212; were really quite comparable to what we&#8217;ve seen in vaccines that all of us have been administering to our children over years and years.</p>



<p>The bottom line of all of this is that the FDA evaluation and analysis of the safety, effectiveness, and manufacturing data were very rigorously and comprehensively looked at to support the EUA.&nbsp; The known and potential benefits clearly outweigh the known and potential risks in this pediatric population.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And we want to make sure you understand, parents, that prior to making the decision to authorize and recommend these vaccines, the FDA&#8217;s and CDC&#8217;s independent advisory committees, as you heard, were consulted and voted unanimously in support of the authorization and the recommendation.&nbsp; Therefore, we are all very enthusiastic about getting your children vaccinated with these now available products.</p>



<p>Back to you, Dr. Jha.</p>



<p>DR. JHA:&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; Thank you, Drs. Fauci and Walensky.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s go ahead and go to questions.&nbsp; And I&#8217;m going to ask my colleague, Kevin Munoz, to get us get us going on that.&nbsp; Kevin?</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Thanks, Dr. Jha.&nbsp; I say this a lot, but we have to keep to one question per person.&nbsp; So, please do that so we can get through as many as we can.</p>



<p>Sheryl Stolberg, New York Times.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, thanks for doing this call.&nbsp; I&#8217;m going to immediately violate your admonition and ask two questions.&nbsp; The first is about the kids’ vaccines.&nbsp; I noticed on the Vaccines.gov that a lot of these pharmacies say they&#8217;ll vaccinate ages three and up, and I wondered why that is and if there&#8217;s a problem with getting vaccines to the youngest children.</p>



<p>And then &#8212; so this is for Dr. Fauci.&nbsp; Dr. Fauci, I think a lot of Americans are just wondering how you&#8217;re feeling and what your experience with COVID was and how you got infected.&nbsp; And I just wondered if you could share a little bit of that.</p>



<p>DR. JHA:&nbsp; Well, why don&#8217;t we start there?&nbsp; Tony, give us an update on how you&#8217;re feeling.</p>



<p>DR. FAUCI:&nbsp; Well, I&#8217;m actually &#8212; Sheryl, thank you for asking &#8212; I&#8217;m feeling really fine.&nbsp; I had some mild symptoms last Tuesday.&nbsp; I checked my antigen test on Wednesday.&nbsp; It was positive.&nbsp; I had one day of symptomatology.&nbsp; I started on Wednesday on Paxlovid.&nbsp; And I was on Paxlovid for five days, and I have now finished Paxlovid and I&#8217;m still feeling really quite fine.</p>



<p>I think I&#8217;m an example, given my age, of what we&#8217;re all talking about today.&nbsp; I&#8217;m vaccinated.&nbsp; I&#8217;m doubly boosted.&nbsp; And I believe if that were not the case, I very likely would not be talking to you looking as well as I look, I think, right now.&nbsp; So, all is well with Fauci, and thank you for asking.</p>



<p>DR. JHA:&nbsp; You look great, Tony.&nbsp; So, indeed, thank goodness for vaccines and Paxlovid.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the issue of kids under three, this is &#8212; and vaccinating kids under three, this is really about the PREP Act. And, Rochelle, I don&#8217;t know if you know more about the details behind this to comment about why it is that some places will vaccinate kids under three and other places on won&#8217;t.</p>



<p>DR. WALENSKY:&nbsp; Yeah, no, I would say much of this may be related to the PREP Act, but also ability of pharmacies to handle younger kids and also the willingness of parents to potentially want to take their younger kids to where they routinely get vaccinated, whether it&#8217;s their local community health center or their local pediatrician.</p>



<p>DR. JHA:&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; Next question.</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Let&#8217;s go to Tamara Keith at NPR.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks for taking my question.&nbsp; President Biden was recently asked if there is enough supply of vaccines for these children, and he said that, &#8220;We&#8217;ll get through at least this year,&#8221; with the current level of funding.&nbsp; I&#8217;m hoping you could verify whether that is the case and also expand out.&nbsp; Is there enough funding for every American who needs a bivalent vaccine, if one of those is developed, to be able to get that?</p>



<p>DR. JHA:&nbsp; Yeah, so he was asked &#8212; I think I was there when he was asked this question.&nbsp; He was largely being asked about the current campaign for kids.&nbsp; And so, let me be very clear on that.&nbsp; We have more than enough Moderna and Pfizer for every child who wants one or every parent of a child who wants one for this pediatric vaccine campaign.</p>



<p>As you all know, we&#8217;ve been very open that we have moved money from other critical programs at HHS to an effort to buy some vaccines.&nbsp; We do not believe we have actually, just based on &#8212; again, without getting into the details of the contracting, which has not happened yet &#8212; we will not have enough vaccines for every American who wants one this fall and winter.&nbsp; So, that&#8217;s, of course, the bivalent vaccines that we&#8217;re talking about.&nbsp; We should have enough for potentially high-risk individuals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But one of the reasons we&#8217;ve been asking for additional funding from Congress is we need funding to make sure that every American who wants a bivalent vaccine, should one be authorized by the FDA, has the ability to do that.</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Let&#8217;s go to MJ Lee at CNN.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; This question is for Dr. Jha.&nbsp; Just revisiting the warning that you had made last month that the U.S. could potentially see 100 million new COVID infections if Congress doesn&#8217;t approve more funding.&nbsp; Given that that was based on preliminary and early data from modelers and experts, I&#8217;m just wondering whether now, more than a month later, you have an update or a revision on the forecast for the fall and winter, or does the 100 million new infections still fall somewhere in the middle of the projections that you have been studying.</p>



<p>DR. JHA:&nbsp; Yeah, so, MJ, as I &#8212; as I said about a month ago, we are constantly looking at a whole range of data, both internal models developed by government scientists, as well as external models.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re planning for a range of scenarios. And that&#8217;s &#8212; of course, one of the range of scenarios we have is that we could see a substantial wave of infections.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re expecting new models and new data in the upcoming weeks.&nbsp; Again, it&#8217;s always hard to make longer-term projections.&nbsp; As we get closer to the date, you get more modeling data coming out.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, you know, my feeling is that we&#8217;re going to update people with kind of both what we&#8217;re seeing in the modeling data, but also what kinds of different scenarios we&#8217;re planning for. At the end of the day &#8212; and I&#8217;ve said this before &#8212; we try not to be in the prediction business and we try to be in the planning business.&nbsp; And we have to plan for a range of scenarios, obviously always hoping that we get a very mild winter that we have very few infections.&nbsp; But hoping is not a strategy.&nbsp; We are planning for a range of different scenarios.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So is the 100 million still somewhere in the ra- &#8212; the middle of the range of the projections that you&#8217;ve been seeing, since that was a warning you had made last month?</p>



<p>DR. JHA:&nbsp; Yeah, so it was a couple of months ago, and I said it was one of the many things that we were seeing.&nbsp; And we have not gotten any updated numbers that I can report back on today.</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Let’s go to Tom Howell at the Washington Times.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey, thanks for doing this.&nbsp; Just real quick, do you know how many of these pediatric shots have been administered this week, not just delivered?&nbsp; And can you talk about how or why the U.S. became the first country in the world to offer these vaccines to zero to four years old?&nbsp; It seems like places like the UK or Israel sometimes beat the U.S. to the punch.&nbsp; I’m just wondering why that was not the case this time.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>



<p>DR. JHA:&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; So let me start on the second.&nbsp; And then the first question of when we will have data on vaccines administered, I&#8217;m going to turn it over to Dr. Walensky, since CDC tracks that very closely.</p>



<p>You know, we had been among the first on getting vaccines authorized for almost every age group.&nbsp; Certainly on mRNA vaccines, we were the first to do that for adults.&nbsp; And then we have moved very quickly on getting authorizations for kids 12 to 17, then 5 to 11, and now zero to 4.</p>



<p>I think it is a combination of really vigorous scientific work that&#8217;s been done by the companies in close partnership with FDA, who has been very transparent and open about the standards required to get these authorizations.&nbsp; So I think it&#8217;s been a lot of very proactive work on these vaccines that has actually made America pretty consistently a leader, certainly on the mRNA vaccines, in terms of authorizing it for different populations.</p>



<p>On the issue of how many kids have gotten vaccinated, administered doses, I&#8217;m going to turn it over to Rochelle.&nbsp; Rochelle, when are we going to be able to see data coming in on that?</p>



<p>DR. WALENSKY:&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; Thank you, Ashish.&nbsp; We intend &#8212; we plan to be very transparent in terms of the administration numbers, as we have been for all of our cohorts of children and adults getting vaccinated and boosted.&nbsp; Right now, we&#8217;re doing the work of delivering and then, of course, the administration.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re working with our immunization partners in our jurisdictions to receive the administration data.&nbsp; When we have those in a more complete fashion, we&#8217;ll be able to report those publicly.</p>



<p>DR. JHA:&nbsp; All right, next question.</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Let&#8217;s go to Meg Tirrell at CNBC.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, thank you.&nbsp; Just one quick one, and then another one.&nbsp; The clinical guidelines from the CDC say that the doses can be spaced for the primary series for the littlest kids from you know, four or three, depending if it&#8217;s Moderna or Pfizer, up to eight weeks.&nbsp; Just wondering how you&#8217;d advise parents to think about how far they should space out those doses.</p>



<p>And then, just more broadly, you talked about the individual protection against severe disease from these vaccines.&nbsp; What will some of the social effects be of having this vaccine available?&nbsp; Will it mean things like you won&#8217;t have to quarantine if you&#8217;re in daycare, things like that?&nbsp; What will be &#8212; what will be the effect on parents and families?</p>



<p>DR. JHA:&nbsp; Rochelle, why don’t I have you handle both those?</p>



<p>DR. WALENSKY:&nbsp; Yeah, so I would say part of the reason for the range is to just recognize that it may be hard to keep &#8212; especially during summertime, with travel and with kids in camp, it may be hard to be strict to do the three or four weeks.</p>



<p>But I would say if you&#8217;re at risk of severe outcomes, if you’re &#8212; certainly if you&#8217;re immunocompromised, you want to be able to be fully protected as soon as possible.&nbsp; So I would err on the earlier side of that administration course.</p>



<p>With regard to guidance for families and for updated guidance, you know, we are actively &#8212; always continuously looking at our guidance.&nbsp; I would say the most important thing to do is to get your child vaccinated and get your family vaccinated, and that will deliver the most protection to you and your family and allow you to not be at risk of severe disease.</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Let&#8217;s go to Cheyenne Haslett at ABC News.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you for doing this.&nbsp; To follow up on the issue of COVID funding, can you say how many vaccines you&#8217;ve been able to purchase with that money that you diverted, or when you might be able to announce that, if it&#8217;s still in negotiations?</p>



<p>And what is the plan, if that&#8217;s not going to cover all Americans &#8212; since COVID funding seems off the table &#8212; to get people vaccines, you know, even if they&#8217;re not free from the government?</p>



<p>DR. JHA:&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; Two good questions.&nbsp; So we can&#8217;t talk about numbers because the negotiations have just gotten started, so there are no numbers to report.</p>



<p>Again, just to be very clear, we&#8217;re talking about bivalent vaccines that would be purchased for this fall and winter.&nbsp; Those bivalent vaccines have not even been authorized by the FDA.&nbsp; We think the FDA is going to authorize bivalent vaccines, but we&#8217;re not sure.</p>



<p>So, first of all, we&#8217;re going to hear more from the FDA next week.&nbsp; Then, negotiators &#8212; kind of, contract negotiators on behalf of U.S. government are going to enter into contract negotiations with Moderna and Pfizer, with the resources that we&#8217;ve been able to pull together, cobble together for vaccines for the fall.&nbsp; It&#8217;s very clear we&#8217;re not going to have enough vaccines for every adult who wants one.<br><br>But &#8212; and then we continue to have conversations, and we&#8217;ll continue to have conversations, with both Republicans and Democrats on the &#8212; on the Hill.<br><br>You know, look, I &#8212; I&#8217;m an eternal optimist.&nbsp; I remain convinced that Congress is not going to walk away at this point in the pandemic, when we have made so much progress and as we are looking into a fall and winter, with a new generation of vaccines.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t believe Congress will walk away and say, “We&#8217;re not going to make sure that every American who wants a vaccine is able to get one.”<br><br>There isn&#8217;t &#8212; there is not a commercialization plan that somehow would be &#8212; would be ready in time for this fall and winter.&nbsp; So we really have to make sure we have the resources we need so that people who want a vaccine this fall and winter from, you know, again, this new generation of vaccines &#8212; which we&#8217;ll hear more about from the FDA in the next week or so &#8211;we&#8217;ve got to make sure that that&#8217;s available to every American.</p>



<p><br>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Last question.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s go to Zeke Miller at the AP.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks for doing this.&nbsp; Just to follow up on the last question: Is there a &#8212; has any country cut in front of the U.S. on the contracting front?&nbsp; Last month, when you were &#8212; Dr. Jha, when you were saying the U.S. needed the money now to start the contracting process, it was to prevent other countries from moving in front of the line.&nbsp; So if you can clarify, is the U.S. still at the front of the line?<br><br>And, relatedly, just on your last point there, you said there&#8217;s no commercialization plan in place for the fall.&nbsp; So if the U.S. doesn&#8217;t have money to provide free vaccines for populations that aren&#8217;t high risk &#8212; other adults, they won&#8217;t even be able to buy those vaccines out of their own pocket?&nbsp; They&#8217;re just out of luck?&nbsp; Is that the administration&#8217;s message to them right now?</p>



<p>DR. JHA:&nbsp; So, first of all, on the issue of countries, I can talk about what&#8217;s public.&nbsp; I know Germany has signed contracts for a next generation of vaccines, these bivalent vaccines.&nbsp; I believe, both with Moderna and Pfizer &#8212; although I&#8217;m not 100 percent sure &#8212; but they certainly have &#8212; what we know is that many European countries are far along in their &#8212; in their contract negotiations with these companies.<br><br>We have not entered into those negotiations.&nbsp; We&#8217;re about to, because we&#8217;ve pulled these resources together.<br><br>So, you know, this is a problem, right?&nbsp; And we want to make sure that when these vaccines get authorized by the FDA and they get produced, that Americans are able to get them in time, before we see any kind of a fall or winter surge where we just see one.<br><br>So the &#8212; one of the reasons we pulled resources from other critical programs was we just felt like we couldn&#8217;t wait any longer.&nbsp; And if we waited much longer, we would not be able to get these vaccines &#8212; certainly for our high-risk individuals &#8212; in time to protect them.&nbsp; Certainly, if we got an early surge of infections, we would be &#8212; we would really not have the vaccines we needed.<br><br>In terms of, you know, what to do for people who are not high risk for whom we may not be able to purchase vaccines &#8212; look, this is a huge challenge.&nbsp; As I said, there is not an obvious way to get these things commercialized.<br><br>If you think about it from the perspective of these companies, they&#8217;re negotiating with countries around the world.&nbsp; They have certain limitations to their &#8212; to their production capacity.&nbsp; And &#8212; and it&#8217;s &#8212; there&#8217;s not an easy way to make sure that the commercial purchasers somehow get in and beat out other countries to have product available.<br><br>So, we don&#8217;t &#8212; we&#8217;re &#8212; we&#8217;re looking at all the contingencies.&nbsp; We don&#8217;t get to walk away, right?&nbsp; And it&#8217;s one thing for Congress to say, “We&#8217;re not going to support this.”&nbsp; The administration doesn&#8217;t get to do that.&nbsp; We are in this.&nbsp; We&#8217;re going to figure out solutions.&nbsp; But it would be a whole lot easier to make sure every American who wants a vaccine can get one and be protected if we can get funding from Congress.</p>



<p><br>MODERATOR:  We are done, Dr. Jha.<br><br>DR. JHA:  Thank you very much, Kevin.  Thank you, everybody, for joining us.  Huge thanks to my colleagues, Drs. Walensky and Fauci.  Great to see Dr. Fauci fully recovered and doing better. <br><br>Thank you for &#8212; all of you for joining us this afternoon.  We will be back again to give you more updates, but really appreciate people taking the time.  And thank you for your patience in the beginning when we had some technical issues.  And have a great day.  Thank you.<br><br>3:12 P.M.
