<p>As President Biden considers a range of deeply qualified potential nominees for the Supreme Court and seeks the advice of lawmakers in both parties as well as legal experts across the country, he is adding three new advisors for the nomination and confirmation process.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">East Room, The White House </p>



<p>1:49 P.M. EST</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE FIRST LADY:&nbsp; Hi &#8212; well, hello.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; (Laughs.)&nbsp; Thank you very much.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Please be seated.</p>



<p>Gosh, so many friends here.&nbsp; It&#8217;s so nice to see all of you.&nbsp; And you&#8217;re getting me so emotional before I have to speak about cancer.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, anyway, welcome to the White House.</p>



<p>And, you know, certain words have the power to make time stop: Malignant.&nbsp; Aggressive.&nbsp; Terminal.&nbsp; Cancer.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like a spell, they still the air around us.&nbsp; Frozen in place, we feel the world we knew slipping away.&nbsp; In the span of a breath, a thousand questions fill our minds.&nbsp; &#8220;What can I do?&nbsp; How do I tell people?&nbsp; Why did this happen?&#8221;</p>



<p>And when the hands of the clock begin to move once again, we are not the person we once were, but someone changed: a mother imagining all of the things she might not be there to teach her daughters, a husband wondering how he will juggle chemotherapy appointments with work and childcare, a son trying to be strong for the parents who could outlive him.</p>



<p>It’s not just patients; cancer changes everyone it touches.&nbsp; And in some ways, it touches us all.</p>



<p>For Joe and me, it has stolen our joy.&nbsp; It left us broken in our grief.&nbsp; But through that pain, we found purpose, strengthening our fortitude for this fight to end cancer as we know it.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Almost 30 years ago, four of my friends were diagnosed with breast cancer in one year.&nbsp; And one of my dear friends, Winnie, lost her battle.&nbsp; Winnie inspired me to take up the cause of prevention and education.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And since then, I’ve seen the darkness of this disease: financial devastation, confusion over care, and far too many families mourning loved ones.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet, I’ve also seen hope.</p>



<p>In just this last year, I met a woman whose life was saved by determined nurses who just wouldn’t let her skip her screening.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I met a doctor who was inspired to become a cancer researcher because she survived her own diagnosis as a child.</p>



<p>I’ve seen people come together from rival companies or opposite political parties, sharing knowledge and finding common cause, united by the chance to save lives.</p>



<p>A cancer diagnosis today may still leave us feeling hopeless, but we are not hopeless and we are not helpless.</p>



<p>We are living in a golden age of research and discovery.&nbsp; We can end this terror, and all of us have a role to play.</p>



<p>Because this isn’t just about hoping that one person will decipher the answers alone; it’s about listening to patients and survivors and their families, and easing the burden they face.</p>



<p>It’s about the individual choices we can make to stop this disease before it’s too late: to get screenings, to be vigilant with our health.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It’s about federal and state governments, the business community, and non-profit organizations all helping to make those screenings more available and accessible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s about bringing the brightest minds and the fiercest hearts to the table to learn and to collaborate and to discover together.</p>



<p>Yes, cancer has the power to rewrite our lives.&nbsp; But we have the power too &#8212; more than we even know.&nbsp; We can stop it in its tracks.&nbsp; We can comfort and discover and dream our way past its paralysis.&nbsp; We can come together and rewrite the story that cancer tells.</p>



<p>Now, as your First Lady, I’m deeply proud to be a partner in the commitments we’re making to the Cancer Moonshot today.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We’re ensuring that all of our government is ready to get to work.&nbsp; We’re going to break down the walls that hold research back.&nbsp; We’re going to bring the best of our nation together &#8212; patients, survivors, caregivers, researchers, doctors, and advocates &#8212; all of you &#8212; so that we can get this done.</p>



<p>And I want you to know that I’ll be there working right beside you.</p>



<p>So, I’m so honored to welcome all of you here to the White House today to take this next step.</p>



<p>Together, we will give Americans a reason to hope.&nbsp; We will use this power of this White House to make your life better.&nbsp; And we will build a future where the word &#8220;cancer&#8221; forever loses its power.</p>



<p>Thank you.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, it’s my pleasure to welcome out next speaker.</p>



<p>Vice President Harris knows the heartache of cancer, but she also knows how much hope can be found in our scientific community.&nbsp; She knows it because she saw it firsthand in her brilliant mother who dedicated her life to researching breast cancer.</p>



<p>Kamala, you honor your mom’s memory every single day, but I believe she’s especially proud of you today.</p>



<p>Please welcome the Vice President of the United States, Kamala Harris.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; END&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1:57 P.M. EST</p>

<p>The President is announcing a judicial nominee, who is extraordinarily qualified, experienced, and devoted to the rule of law and our Constitution. This choice continues to fulfill the President’s promise to ensure that the nation’s courts reflect the diversity that is one of our greatest assets as a country — both in terms of personal and professional backgrounds.</p>



<p>Stephanie Dawkins Davis is the President’s nominee to the Sixth Circuit of the U.S. Court of Appeals.&nbsp; Judge Davis would be the first Black woman to serve on the Sixth Circuit from Michigan and only the second Black woman to serve on the Sixth Circuit.</p>



<p>This is President Biden’s fourteenth announcement of nominees for federal judicial positions, bringing the number of announced federal judicial nominees to 84.</p>



<p>President Biden has spent decades committed to strengthening the federal bench, which is why he continues to move rapidly to fill judicial vacancies.</p>



<p>CIRCUIT COURT<br><strong><u>Stephanie Dawkins Davis: Nominee for the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit</u></strong></p>



<p>Judge Stephanie Dawkins Davis has served as a federal judge on the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan since December 2019. Judge Davis previously served as a Magistrate Judge for the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan from 2016 to 2019. From 1997 to 2016, Judge Davis served in the United States Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Michigan as Executive Assistant United States Attorney from 2010 to 2015 and as an Assistant United States Attorney from 1997 to 2010. During her tenure, she also served as Deputy Chief of the Controlled Substances Unit from 2007 to 2010. Judge Davis began her career as an associate at Dickinson, Wright PLLC in Detroit, Michigan, from 1992 to 1997. Judge Davis received her J.D. from Washington University School of Law in 1992 and her B.S. from Wichita State University in 1989.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"> Via Teleconference</p>



<p>6:32 P.M. EST</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. MUNOZ:&nbsp; Hey, everybody.&nbsp; Thank you for joining tonight’s call on how the President plans to reignite the Cancer Moonshot to end cancer as we know it.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a reminder, this call will be attributable to “senior administration officials” and be embargoed until tomorrow a.m. &#8212; at 5:00 a.m.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Joining us on tonight’s call is [senior administration official].&nbsp; Also joining us is [senior administration official].&nbsp; We have some remarks at the top from both of them, and we’ll have time for questions at the end.&nbsp; And we ask that you keep questions relevant to the Cancer Moonshot.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And with that, I will turn it to [senior administration official].<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Thank you so much.&nbsp; Welcome, everybody.&nbsp; I’m [redacted].&nbsp; I’m joined by [senior administration official, who [redacted].&nbsp; [Redacted] and will have lots to say, and we’ll both speak back and forth on the effort.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, today, we’re going to preview this announcement that the President will be making tomorrow.&nbsp; You’ve got the factsheet.&nbsp; And just to confirm, we’ll be speaking on background, and the news is under embargo until 5:00 a.m. Eastern tomorrow.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, just to set the stage, you will all recall that as Vice President, in 2016, Joe Biden led the Cancer Moonshot with the mission of accelerating the rate of progress against cancer.&nbsp;&nbsp;And the cancer community and the patient community and medical researchers responded with tremendous energy and ingenuity.&nbsp;&nbsp;And there’s been a lot of progress that has come since then.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And because of that and because of the amazing possibilities ahead, tomorrow, in remarks here at the White House, President Biden is going to reignite the Cancer Moonshot.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, [senior administration official]?<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I’ll give a little bit of a preview of what the event will look like.&nbsp;&nbsp;It will take place in the East Room of the White House.&nbsp;&nbsp;The First Lady and the Vice President will also give remarks.&nbsp;&nbsp;And we will lay out, as [senior administration official] said, the President’s plan, this administration’s plan around the Cancer Moonshot.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In attendance in the room will be about 100 members of the cancer community, from patients and survivors, their caregivers and families, advocacy organizations, research organizations and individual researchers, and those from the healthcare community, representatives from industry, members of Congress, members of the Cabinet, and beyond.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So we’ll have a big event, really setting the stage for this announcement.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; So, why is the President reigniting the Cancer Moonshot?&nbsp; Well, because a lot has changed that makes it possible to set really ambitious goals right now.<br><br>The Cancer Moonshot was launched five years ago, and lots has happened.&nbsp; In addition, I have to say that the scientific advances that we saw from the COVID-19 pandemic, from the response to it, also points to things that are possible today.<br><br>So, for all those reasons, the President is going to set some very ambitious goals: Number one, to reduce the death rate from cancer by at least 50 percent over the next 25 years &#8212; I’ll put that in context in a moment of what that means &#8212; and to really substantially improve the experience of people and their families living and surviving with cancer.&nbsp; And by doing these things and more &#8212; two, as the President likes to say and will say: to end cancer as we know it today.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, the President and the First Lady are also going to announce, very importantly, a call to action on cancer screening to jumpstart progress on screenings that were missed as a result of the pandemic, and help ensure that everybody equitably benefits from the tools that we already have to prevent and detect and diagnose cancer, which are extremely valuable and we need to get everybody to be able to take full advantage of those.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, let me &#8212; let me review, just very briefly, how we got here, what’s come before.&nbsp; And then I will turn it a little bit, after [senior administration official] leaves (inaudible), to what exactly we mean by “end cancer as we know it.”<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So &#8212; but let’s go back.&nbsp; You know, 50 years ago, the National Cancer Institu- &#8212; the National Cancer Act was passed.&nbsp; And, you know, for the first 25 years or so, you really didn’t see much change in the death rate from cancer &#8212; this age-adjusted death rate that gets measured.&nbsp; It was pretty flat for a long time.&nbsp; And then we began to see a decrease.<br><br>And over the last 20 or so years, the age-adjusted death rate from cancer has fallen by about 25 percent.&nbsp; And that is really remarkable.&nbsp; It had been flat, and now it fell by 25 percent, which means many more people are surviving cancer, living longer after being diagnosed with cancer.&nbsp;<br><br>And it wasn’t one thing; it was progress on multiple fronts.&nbsp; It includes:</p>



<ul><li>Treatments that target specific mutations; it used to be all the cancer drugs were just cellular poisons.&nbsp; But, specifically, targeted mutation drugs became developed about 20 or so years ago.</li><li>Therapies that use our immune system to detect and kill cancer cells; this was a new idea that really came into full force within the last 10 years or so.</li><li>Cancer vaccines, like the HPV vaccine, that go to the heart of protecting you against those cancers &#8212; at least seven of them &#8212; that are caused by a specific virus.</li><li>And then, new tools, like low-dose CT scans and more refined uses of&nbsp;colonoscopies, and pretty impressive progress against tobacco use through public health campaigns.</li></ul>



<p>All these things together led to this decrease and led to the point that we see even more on the horizon, and the President is prepared to set pretty exciting and ambitious goals.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; And we want to kind of place tomorrow’s announcement in what the administration has already done.&nbsp; This is not the first time that the administration has policies or budgets were focused on cancer.&nbsp;<br><br>In the last year, the Biden-Harris Administration has maintained our commitment to ending cancer as we know it.&nbsp; For example, in the President’s first budget, he sustained strong funding for biomedical and health research with increased funding for the National Institutes of Health and the National Cancer Institute, and full funding for the 21st Century Cures Act, including the funding for cancer research at the NCI, named the Beau Biden Cancer Moonshot Initiative.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The President also proposed a bold, new vision for biomedical and health research in the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health, or ARPA-H. &nbsp;Its goal is to improve the U.S. government’s capabilities to speed research that can improve human health, to improve our ability to prevent, detect, and treat a range of diseases including cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, and other.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;President Biden committed to a bilateral effort in the spring of last year with the United Kingdom to take on the challenges of cancer together.&nbsp;&nbsp;This has already resulted in a November 2021 U.S.-UK Cancer Scientific Meeting of leadership, patient advocates, and oncology research experts which produced recommendations for how the two nations can work together in partnership to make even more urgent progress on cancer.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First Lady Jill Biden’s advocacy for cancer education and prevention began decades ago, in 1993, when four of her friends were diagnosed with breast cancer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following that year, she launched the Biden Breast Health Initiative to educate Delaware high school girls about the importance of cancer prevention.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As First Lady, she continues her work emphasizing early detection efforts and the patient, family, and caregiver experience with cancer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She will also stress the importance of cancer screenings, especially those delayed or put off due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and will urge government partners, the business community, and non-profit sectors to help make screenings more accessible and available to all.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we just really wanted to reiterate the Biden-Harris administration has prioritized this from the beginning, in addition to prioritizing strengthening healthcare for the American people in a number of other ways, by lowering healthcare costs and expanding coverage.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp;&nbsp;So, let me turn to what the President is going to lay out as goals and to what they mean.<br><br>So, President Biden tomorrow is going to set national goals for the Cancer Moonshot, as I said, by working together over the next 25 years to cut today’s age-adjusted death rate from cancer by at least 50 percent from where we are today, and to improve the experience of people and their families living with and surviving cancer.&nbsp;&nbsp;And again, taken together with these and other actions, it would drive us to ending cancer as we know it.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, how do we know cancer?&nbsp;&nbsp;To explain what we mean by that, we have to ask, &#8220;How do we know cancer today?&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I&#8217;m going to give you seven ways we know cancer today that we think we can make really substantial progress in changing pretty dramatically.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Number one, you know, we know cancer is a disease where we have too few effective ways to prevent it.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some: Don&#8217;t smoke, for example.&nbsp;&nbsp;But we don&#8217;t have lots of effective ways right now to prevent cancer.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Number two, this is a disease where we just usually diagnose it too late.&nbsp;&nbsp;Early diagnosis is so important.&nbsp;&nbsp;But way too often, we diagnose it too late.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Number three, it&#8217;s a disease where we know too little about why treatments work well for some patients and fail to work for other patients.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Number four, we still have too many cancer types for which we still lack good strategies for developing treatments.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Number five, we still have stark inequities in diagnosis, access to treatments and clinical trials, and inequities in patient outcomes based on race, on region, on resources.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Number six, a disease where we leave most patients and families to have to navigate the disease and its aftermath on their own.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And number seven, we know cancer today is a disease where we just don&#8217;t learn from most patients&#8217; experiences.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are seven concrete ways in which we know cancer today.&nbsp; And every one of them, there is a lot to do to change.&nbsp; Some of them are about science; there&#8217;s new scientific opportunities that are possible.&nbsp; Some of them are about policy.&nbsp; And some of them are just about being absolutely determined to work some of these problems until they get solved.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, let me elaborate on some of these seven ways which we cancer.&nbsp; I said we have few effective ways to prevent it.&nbsp; Well, there&#8217;s everything from expanding screening for inherited cancer risk, figuring out who&#8217;s inherited a cancer gene.&nbsp; We do that in some cases, but it&#8217;s not really broadly done.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But at a scientific end, we can also take lessons from the mRNA vaccines that were developed against the COVID-19 &#8212; the virus that causes COVID-19 &#8212; by asking, &#8220;Can we make mRNA vaccines that teach your immune system to recognize the distinctive mutations that occur in cancer cells?&#8221;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There&#8217;s a lot of thinking right now that things like that could cause your body to be able to recognize and attack those early cancer cells before there&#8217;s even any tumor to see and could decrease the overall incidence.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We diagnose too late.&nbsp; What can you do about that?&nbsp; Well, there&#8217;s a lot of &#8212; a lot of work going on right now about ideas like maybe an annual blood test to detect dozens of cancers simultaneously based on free-floating DNA in the blood.&nbsp; You know, ideas like that will take a lot of work.&nbsp; They&#8217;re going to have to be clinically tested to prove that they really save lives and they&#8217;re going to have to be affordable enough to roll out to the American people.&nbsp; But there is real, concrete work to do that could lead to prevention, that can lead to early diagnosis,<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You know, stark inequities.&nbsp; We really have to target prevention and early detection to those who need it most and those who just can&#8217;t take advantage of it usually, for lots of reasons.&nbsp; There are all sorts of reasons that people can&#8217;t, say, participate in clinical trials if it means having to go to a major academic medical center.&nbsp; But, well, you even learned from the pandemic that clinical trials can happen out in community hospitals, and telehealth and local sample collection can make a big difference.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And there are people who can&#8217;t take advantage of diagnosis and treatment because just the out-of-pocket costs can be a real barrier &#8212; just transportation, time off from work, childcare.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So taking on those inequities which affect &#8212; you know, which are associated with higher mortality rates in different populations &#8212; in the Black population for certain cancers, in rural populations for certain cancers.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You know, I said where we know too little about why they work in some patients and not others &#8212; there are ways now to figure out, if we really apply our tools, which treatments work for which patients, but we&#8217;ve got to collect that data and we&#8217;ve got to share those data.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Strategies for developing treatments against some kinds of cancers &#8212; the President is very committed to his proposal of an ARPA-H agency at the NIH to take on bold, transformative projects for hard problems like this.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I mentioned patients and their families having to navigate cancer on their own.&nbsp; We need to consider navigation services &#8212; equitable navigation services, navigation services that meet the needs of patients &#8212; as really part of cancer care.&nbsp; They&#8217;re very important.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then last of all, failing to learn from most patients&#8217; experiences.&nbsp; I got to say &#8212; and I know this personally and the President knows it even better: Most patients want their experiences to be of value to future patients.&nbsp; Most &#8212; not every one of them &#8212; but most of them want to share that information, and we got to make sure patients have the right and the ability to contribute their information and data to help others if they choose to do that.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I could go into details on that, and we will in the coming weeks, and we&#8217;re going to gather the community together to flesh this out far better than the ideas we&#8217;ve already put down.&nbsp; But we are convinced that under each of these seven headings, there is a lot that can be done.&nbsp; And by reigniting the Moonshot, it&#8217;s going to bring people together &#8212; patients, advocates, researchers, physicians, companies, and many, many others &#8212; to really make sure that we make each of these things no longer the barriers that they are today.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, [senior administration official], let&#8217;s talk about some of the actions that will take place.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Yeah, thanks, [senior administration official].&nbsp; So, [senior administration official] just laid out some of the promise and opportunity in these areas that we&#8217;re defining under ending cancer as we know it.&nbsp; And what we&#8217;re really talking about, from the administration side, is mobilizing the entire government behind this effort as a presidential priority.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the Biden-Harris administration, the Cancer Moonshot specifically will reestablish White House leadership with a focused White House Cancer Moonshot Coordinator in the Office of the President.&nbsp; This will demonstrate the President and First Lady&#8217;s personal commitment to making progress and to really leverage this whole-of-government approach and national response that the challenge of cancer demands.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will form a Cancer Cabinet, which will be convened by the White House, bringing together departments and agencies across government to deliver &#8212; to address cancer on multiple fronts.&nbsp; This includes, for example, the Departments of Health and Human Services, Veterans Affairs, Defense, Energy, the Department of Agriculture, EPA, and many others, including the Office of the Vice President, Office of the First Lady, and Office of Science and Technology Policy, and Domestic Policy Council here at the White House.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The President and First Lady will issue a call to action on cancer screening and early detection.&nbsp; As [senior administration official] touched on, we need to get back on track after more than nine and a half million missed cancer screenings in the United States as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With regular recommended screenings, we can often catch cancer when there may be even more effective treatment options or prevent it from developing by removing precancerous tissue.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To help ensure equitable access to screening and prevention, we will promote at-home screening where it&#8217;s possible, especially with tools for colon cancer and HPV, with mobile screening and communities without easy access to a clinic, through the community health networks that have been so important and have built and strengthened during the COVID-19 pandemic, and other ways to really bring screening and early detection to people where they are.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also as a part of this screening call to action, NCI will organize &#8212; the National Cancer Institute, NCI &#8212; will organize the collective efforts of their cancer centers and other networks, such as their Community Oncology Research Network, to offer new access points to compensate for these millions of delayed cancer screening and with a focus on reaching the individuals most at risk.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Federal agencies will develop a focused program &#8212; as [senior administration official] said, the promise in studying multi-cancer detection tests, and really understanding the promise for patients and in extending life there.&nbsp; We’ll develop a focused program to expeditiously study and evaluate multi-cancer detection tests, like we&#8217;ve done for COVID-19 diagnostics.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Department of Health and Human Services will accelerate efforts to nearly eliminate cervical cancer through cervical cancer screening and HPV vaccinations &#8212; again, with a particular focus on reaching those communities outside of the reach currently and most at risk.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the President&#8217;s Cancer Panel, tomorrow, will release a report entitled “Closing Gaps in Cancer Screening,” laying out recommendations focused on connecting people, community, and systems to increase equity and access.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, that&#8217;s on the call to action on cancer screening and early detection.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Additionally, among the specific commitments from this administration on the Cancer Moonshot, we will host a White House Cancer Moonshot Summit, bringing together agency leadership; patient organizations; biopharmaceutical companies; the research, public health, and healthcare communities; and others to highlight innovation and progress and new commitments towards ending cancer as we know it.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will build on an already existing White House Coun- &#8212; White House Cancer Roundtable Series that we&#8217;ve hosted over the last six months.&nbsp; And we&#8217;ll expand the topics to the seven pillars that [senior administration official] outlined for us, and include additional communities and perspectives to make sure that this mission and this agenda is being built by those most impacted by this disease and with the most experience and knowledge to help us identify priorities.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And finally, the President will call for an all-hands-on-deck approach, calling on the private sector, foundations, academic institutions, healthcare providers, and all Americans to take on the mission of reducing the deadly impact of cancer and improving patient experiences in the diagnosis, treatment, and survival of cancer.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I said, progress will be informed by people directly experiencing this disease &#8212; cancer patients, caregivers, and families &#8212; and contributed by all parts of the oncology community and beyond.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tomorrow, we&#8217;ll be launching a website where people can engage and interact with the Cancer Moonshot.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; So, I will wrap up so we can take questions.&nbsp; But let me just say: You&#8217;ve heard what the President is going to lay out tomorrow.&nbsp; You know that for the President and the First Lady, it&#8217;s very personal.&nbsp; Both will speak tomorrow.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It&#8217;s also personal for the Vice President.&nbsp; The Vice President&#8217;s mother, as I&#8217;m sure many of you know, was a breast cancer researcher.&nbsp; She taught at public universities, worked at a national laboratory, published research papers, and collaborated with NIH and scientists around the world.&nbsp; And in 2008, after a lifetime of researching cancer, she was diagnosed with colon cancer and died of the disease the following year.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I could say it&#8217;s personal for me and it&#8217;s personal for [senior administration official] and, I don&#8217;t know, even on a call with 65 journalists, I&#8217;m going to say I bet it&#8217;s personal for the majority of you too &#8212; that all of us come to this less in our official jobs than as people whose lives have been touched by cancer.&nbsp; So, that&#8217;s why the administration is lifting up cancer with such a bold goal.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And we&#8217;re happy to take your questions now.&nbsp; And then I know we&#8217;re only to be able to take a handful of questions, but if you have specific questions after the President&#8217;s remarks tomorrow or want to request an interview, we&#8217;re happy to do that.&nbsp; But the way to do it would be to email us at Press@OSTP.EOP.Gov.&nbsp; And we&#8217;ll be glad to talk more about it.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, with that, let&#8217;s turn back to the White House Communications staff to figure out how we&#8217;re going to take questions.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, thank you for doing this call.&nbsp; I have a couple of questions.&nbsp; First, when President Obama announced the Cancer Moonshot in 2016, his goal was to make a decade&#8217;s worth of advancements in five years.&nbsp; And I&#8217;m wondering: Has that goal been achieved, and do you think the new goal is more ambitious?&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then secondly, on money, Congress authorized $1.8 billion over seven years in 2016 and about $400 million is left.&nbsp; So, is there any new money over and above that behind this Cancer Moonshot?<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Thank you so much for those questions.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, look, I think the Cancer Moonshot that was launched in 2016 was tremendously successful.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve seen all sorts of new possibilities be created &#8212; those kinds of research advances.&nbsp; I would say it&#8217;s fair to say that we saw a decade&#8217;s worth of research advances occur in those past five years.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And it&#8217;s precisely because of that that I think we can talk about setting goals like actually decreasing death rates from cancer over the next 25 years.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It&#8217;s clear now that all sorts of possibilities, like I was talking about &#8212; vaccines &#8212; prophylactic preventative vaccines against cancer &#8212; not something we could have thought of five years ago.&nbsp; And now, you can sit down and write out a plan for how you’d do it and how you might do a clinical trial to observe that you are really preventing.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not easy, but you can do that today.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can &#8212; five years ago, it was not plausible to think about doing these annual blood tests that might screen for cancer.&nbsp; There&#8217;s a lot of work that&#8217;s become possible; now we actually have to do it.&nbsp; We got to reduce this to practice and get it out there.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think the same is true for many of these other areas where we&#8217;ve gotten a really clear understanding of the need to share data and ways to do it that are effective.&nbsp; I think the issues around equity are really clear and urgent right now.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, I think that did its work.&nbsp; And it would not have been possible, not have been plausible to have set out these kinds of goals of decreasing the death rate by 50 percent and taking on these specific categories before, and it is possible now.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, yeah.&nbsp; And I am very confident that there will be robust funding going forward because, I got to say, in these times of disagreements, there&#8217;s certainly one thing on which we all agree on across party, across everything, which is the effect of cancer on their lives.&nbsp; I know of nothing that unites us more and that is more bipartisan.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, Sheryl, thank you so much for that really great question.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. MUNOZ:&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; Next, let&#8217;s try Josh one more time.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All right.&nbsp; [Senior administration official], the questions that Josh had are if there are any new funding commitments to be announced, and what the start date for the 50 percent reduction over 25 years is.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Well, we&#8217;re not going to have a funding commitment tomorrow.&nbsp; I think we&#8217;re going to announce what the plan is, because it&#8217;s pretty important to bring together the Cancer Cabinet, bring together the community.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We&#8217;ve laid out a set of ideas.&nbsp; I want to make sure that we have got everybody at the table contributing those ideas and a plan.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But so, that&#8217;s the answer there.&nbsp; But again, I am very confident there&#8217;s robust support for it.&nbsp; But I’m also very certain that we want to start this by listening and expanding the circle for ideas on these important seven pillars and more.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And when does that start?&nbsp; It starts about now.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know &#8212; you know, I guess this year, let&#8217;s say, for the 25; we’ll start with 2022 and measure 25 years from now.&nbsp; I think that&#8217;s probably precise enough.&nbsp; We don&#8217;t &#8212; it won&#8217;t get down to the day, but they measure this in years.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s see where we are at the end of this year, and that&#8217;s a target for us to really decrease from.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I believe that&#8217;s possible.&nbsp; We cut it by 25 percent &#8212; research and patient-driven solutions and medicine cut it by 25 percent.&nbsp; I think this will make a huge difference if we can achieve this.&nbsp; And it is going to be a shared bipartisan effort over time.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; And one thing to add, [senior administration official]: Setting the goal 25 years out doesn&#8217;t mean that we can&#8217;t start measuring our progress soon.&nbsp; So, taking the death rate by cancer down 50 percent in 25 years is going to take work now, and we&#8217;re going to start to see the results in that year-over-year decrease that we have to keep at the level it is now and even accelerate it.&nbsp; So, it&#8217;s not pushing the measurement out; it&#8217;s just setting a really ambitious goal in the future that we can work really hard now towards making progress on.&nbsp;<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; That&#8217;s a really &#8212; it&#8217;s a really great point.&nbsp; The curve is not going to be a cliff in the 24th year.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s be really clear: It&#8217;s going to be steady decline over this period &#8212; targeting that.&nbsp;<br><br>So, you know, we&#8217;re all going to be looking at that accountably and saying, &#8220;Are we making the quantitative progress to land there?&#8221;&nbsp; So, even though Josh has had trouble connecting, you know, verbally, I appreciate the question being delivered in absentia.&nbsp; So, thank you, Josh, for the great question.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey, thanks, Kevin.&nbsp; And thank you, [senior administration officials], for doing the call.&nbsp; So, President Obama and Vice President Biden &#8212; in 2015, they both used the word “cure” and the phrase “cure cancer” when they rolled out the original Cancer Moonshot.&nbsp; And then-candidate Biden, I think, was criticized for doing the same in 2019 and 2020.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve heard either of you use that word or that phrase in this call.&nbsp; And I&#8217;m wondering whether it&#8217;s fair to read into that as kind of a &#8212; you know, taking a more measured approach using existing interventions and technologies as opposed to making pledges, promises about really remarkable scientific progress that we all hope for but is hard to guarantee.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Well, no, I wouldn&#8217;t read that into it, because I think the words “cure cancer” needs to be understood in the following way: When they talked then about curing cancer, they recognized that the way we decreased the death rate in cancer is we have to start curing cancers for some patients.&nbsp; We have immunotherapies right now that it&#8217;s fair to say are cures; we do not have a recurrence in 5 years, in 10 years.&nbsp; You know, you never want to use the word “cure,” but those are cures.&nbsp;<br><br>We are going to bite off piece by piece &#8212; I don&#8217;t think they said, “We&#8217;re going to cure all cancer all at once.”&nbsp; But you cure cancer by curing them one at a time, a patient at the time, a hundred patients at a time.&nbsp;<br><br>So, I think the idea of &#8212; and we&#8217;re not using the words “cure cancer” because it could be misunderstood by some people as just “get a cure for cancer.”&nbsp; But, Lev, as you know, there&#8217;s 200 types of cancer we need to get therapies for and therapies that extend life long enough to turn into cures for.&nbsp; But we’ve focused on this very measurable thing of decreasing that death rate 50 percent.&nbsp;<br><br>But, no, I would not think that he&#8217;s walking back the words; I think we&#8217;re speaking with a precision.&nbsp; But along that way, the 50 percent is going to be a lot of cures along the way.&nbsp;<br><br>And so, anyway, that&#8217;s &#8212; that&#8217;s it.&nbsp; No walking back, but using words carefully and precisely so that we can hold ourselves accountable.<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; And I think, as you heard [senior administration official] detail how we got to where we are, some of the big things &#8212; some of the big advancements that delivered a change in the death rate by cancer weren&#8217;t on the treatment side; they were on the prevention side, on the early detection side.&nbsp; So, by opening up the frame and talking about “ending cancer as we know it,” it gives us the leverage and the place to really make progress in those areas.&nbsp;<br><br>Because I know having a treatment for cancer &#8212; I was dia- &#8212; if I was diagnosed with cancer, I&#8217;d want to know there was a treatment.&nbsp; But even better is not ending up being diagnosed with that cancer in the first place.&nbsp;<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Right.&nbsp; If we end up with vaccines that can help prevent cancers from ever occurring in the first place &#8212; I guess [senior administration official] is right, that&#8217;s not curing anything, but, boy, it would have a huge impact.&nbsp; So, I think we&#8217;re just trying to use words carefully because we want to be open to the whole portfolio of approaches.&nbsp;<br><br>It’s a great question, Lev.&nbsp; I appreciate your clarifying that.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, thanks for taking my question.&nbsp; You had mentioned ARPA-H and I think had said “in NIH.”&nbsp; Is that decided that that&#8217;s where that agency would be &#8212; inside the NIH instead of its own independent agency?<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Well, when the President first described ARPA-H in the spring as part of &#8212; well, I mean, he’s described it in speeches.&nbsp; But in the speeches and in the budget, he has requested that and proposed that to be a new kind of division within the NIH &#8212; something independent and autonomous, something that has different authorities and different cultures and things like that, but connected to and part of the broader NIH community there.&nbsp;<br><br>So, yes, that&#8217;s how the President has proposed it for sure.&nbsp;<br><br>Thanks.&nbsp; Thank you, Rachel, for the question.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, thanks for taking my question.&nbsp; [Senior administration official], for the new goals you just announced, do you expect the Cancer Cabinet &#8212; to charge it with the agenda?&nbsp; Or will NCI continue to provide central leadership for these efforts &#8212; for the Moonshot &#8212; as the institute has been since 2016?&nbsp; And if so, are there efforts in the works to request funds to support these goals?<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; So, the answer is both.&nbsp; Some of these things, squarely are in the remit of the NCI, but there’ll be other things.&nbsp; Some of the things that need to be done, other agencies have a critical role in.&nbsp; If we&#8217;re going to be deploying &#8212; oh, let&#8217;s say, vaccines that can prevent cervical cancer, and head and neck cancer, these HPV vaccines, that&#8217;s going to be other agencies that will be playing that &#8212; the CDC, for example.&nbsp;<br><br>Some of these questions about, “How do we make sure everybody has access to clinical trials and they can be reimbursed for their out-of-pocket costs and other things?”&nbsp; That might involve CMS.&nbsp;<br><br>So, I think NCI could not be more central.&nbsp; But the idea that this is just limited to cancer research, rather than all of the agencies &#8212; and not just the agencies in HHS.&nbsp; I think VA, DOD, DOE all have contributions to make.&nbsp;<br><br>So, there will obviously be huge work at NCI, but we&#8217;re pulling together a Cancer Cabinet to make sure that we get the benefit of all the levers that might be pulled.<br><br>[Senior administration official], do you want to?<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; I think it&#8217;s important to emphasize that [senior administration official] had just added VA and DOD.&nbsp; And not only do they have important research programs and research goals, but they also run health systems.&nbsp; And so, they&#8217;re very much a part of the work here, as they were in 2016.&nbsp;<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; I mean, the VA has health information systems that we&#8217;ve learned tremendous amounts from.&nbsp; There are medical records from which you can learn a tremendous amount.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll just note, I saw a study on multiple sclerosis.&nbsp; It just underscores that we can learn a lot in a lot of places, and we want no stone unturned in this effort.&nbsp;<br><br>Thank you, Matt, for the question.&nbsp; Really good question.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey, guys, thanks for doing this call.&nbsp; Can you guys go into a little more detail about how you see the First Lady&#8217;s role?&nbsp; Obviously, for the vaccine efforts, she&#8217;s traveled around the country.&nbsp; Do you see her doing that, sort of, same kind of work?&nbsp; And will she be, sort of, the face of a piece of this initiative?&nbsp; Thank you.<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Yes, the First Lady has &#8212; is very much a part of this.&nbsp; She&#8217;s a part of the event tomorrow.&nbsp; And as you mentioned, she has been out there with public health messages since the start of the administration.&nbsp; She has spent some time in the last year doing work specifically on cancer, especially around cancer screening and early detection.&nbsp; And we expect &#8212; not only in that area, but we expect her to have some leadership role there with more to come. &nbsp;<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp;

<p>The United States Government is proud to be the largest donor for global health. As we work to end the COVID-19 pandemic, we remain committed to strengthening health systems and institutions; advancing global health security; combatting HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis; advancing sexual and reproductive health and rights, and maternal, neonatal, and child health; closing gaps in nutrition and non-communicable diseases; and accelerating efforts towards universal health coverage and the Sustainable Development Agenda. In Fiscal Year (FY) 2021, the United States appropriated over $9 billion in global health programs, in addition to almost $16 billion in emergency supplemental funding for COVID-19.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>We continue to lead the global community toward a safer, more equitable future. Over the last year, the Biden-Harris Administration has renewed the U.S. leadership in global health, and taken decisive steps to advance global health priorities, including:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Supporting and strengthening the WHO.</strong> Among his first acts in office one year ago, President Biden declared the United States would reengage with the World Health Organization (WHO), highlighting our nation’s commitment to advancing multilateral cooperation in a time of international health crisis. Last week, the United States once again demonstrated that commitment, by leading a successful decision at the WHO Executive Board meeting to strengthen the International Health Regulations (2005). This strengthening will enhance the world’s ability to prevent, detect, and rapidly respond to infectious disease outbreaks in the future. Beyond COVID-19, the United States is collaborating with global partners through WHO on a wide range of global health challenges such as childhood immunization, nutrition, polio eradication, strengthening the global health workforce to achieve universal health coverage, and tackling the threat that climate change poses to health. These and other issues remain critical priorities, especially in the wake of COVID-19, and demonstrate the importance of strong, equitable health systems that serve those most at risk.<br></li><li><strong>Leading the global COVID-19 response. </strong>Under President Biden’s leadership, the United States has committed to donate 1.2 billion doses of safe and effective vaccine to the world, more than any other nation. To date, we have shipped over 400 million of those vaccines to 112 countries around the world, all for free, with no strings attached or promises extracted. We were the first nation to purchase doses solely for the purpose of donation, with the historic purchase of 1 billion doses of Pfizer vaccine. We were the first nation to step out of the queue for Moderna vaccines, allowing the African Union quicker access to tens of millions of doses. We were the first to broker access to doses for individuals in humanitarian crises. And now, we are leading the push to turn vaccines into vaccinations, with the creation of the Global Vaccine Initiative. To date, the United States is providing nearly $16 billion for life-saving health, economic, and humanitarian COVID-19 assistance to our partners to fight this virus and its impacts. These funds are delivering shots in arms, lifesaving supplies to hospitals, and support that reaches the most vulnerable communities.<br></li><li><strong>Advancing sexual and reproductive health and rights. </strong>One of President Biden’s first actions was issuing a Presidential Memorandum on Protecting Women’s Health at Home and Abroad, which revoked the expanded Mexico City Policy and directed agencies to resume funding to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) in support of its essential work to prevent maternal deaths, expand access to voluntary family planning, and prevent and respond to gender-based violence around the world. The Administration continues to advance sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) for all in the face of continued threats. The White House Gender Policy Council released the first-ever <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/National-Strategy-on-Gender-Equity-and-Equality.pdf">National Strategy on Gender Equity and Equality</a>, which emphasizes the core role of advancing SRHR to achieve gender equality. As the largest bilateral donor to family planning, the United States also leads globally by advancing SRHR in multilateral fora and with bilateral partners. As we address the indirect impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on health systems and vulnerable populations, the United States has supported increased access to SRHR services, particularly in emergency contexts.<br></li><li><strong>Continued global leadership on addressing HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis.</strong> Last week, the U.S. President&#8217;s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) celebrated its nineteen-year anniversary. Since its inception and with bilateral support, the U.S. Government has invested $100 billion to transform the global AIDS response. PEPFAR has saved more than 21 million lives, prevented millions of HIV infections, and helped countries build a strong foundation to prevent, detect, and respond to other health threats, including COVID-19. Across 55 countries, PEPFAR invests over $1 billion annually in local health systems strengthening to respond to HIV. At the end of FY21, PEPFAR supported 63.4 million people with HIV testing services, and 18.96 million people with antiretroviral treatment. With $250 million in funding through the American Rescue Plan Act, PEPFAR has continued to advance HIV gains and supported the global COVID-19 response. The U.S. President’s Malaria Initiative invested $770 million in 2020 to forge forward in the fight against malaria, despite the COVID-19 pandemic, reaching almost 60 million people with malaria medicine and protecting more than 7.5 million pregnant women with preventive treatment for malaria. Through the most recent five-year U.S. Government Global TB Strategy, U.S. government investments led to the treatment of 15.7 million people with TB, starting 438,000 individuals with drug resistant TB on second-line drug therapy, and accomplished a treatment success rate of almost 90 percent.<br></li><li><strong>Building health security capacities.</strong> The United States continues to work with partners across the globe, including 19 intensive support partner countries, to provide assistance to better prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease threats and to meet the target of the multilateral Global Health Security Agenda. The need for these capacities has never been more clear, and robust interagency efforts helped address numerous outbreaks including Ebola, Anthrax, Influenza, Rabies, Polio, Cholera, and more. The U.S. Government’s global health security programs also pivoted to support critical COVID-19 response activities.<br></li><li><strong>Sustaining commitments in maternal and child health. </strong>The United States’ sustained commitment, financial investment, and adaptability has ensured that critical health services continue reaching women, children, and families. In 2020, the United States helped more than 92 million women and children access essential—and often lifesaving—care. The U.S. Government’s investments towards polio eradication have also helped ensure over 400 million children are vaccinated against polio each year; last year was a significant milestone as Africa was declared wild polio free.</li></ul>



<p>In the coming year, the Administration will take the following steps to continue to advance global health priorities:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Continue supporting and strengthening the World Health Organization</strong>. The United States looks forward to rejoining the WHO Executive Board in May 2022, and will launch a Strategic Dialogue with WHO to ensure our mutual priorities are fully aligned. The United States will continue to work closely with WHO and partners around the world, to ensure that the prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse, and support for victims and survivors, remain priority issues.<br></li><li><strong>Accelerate global COVID-19 response efforts. </strong>The U.S. Government will continue to roll out the Initiative for Global Vaccine Access (Global VAX) to accelerate global efforts to get COVID-19 shots into arms and enhance international coordination. This whole of government effort will bolster cold chain supply and logistics, service delivery, vaccine confidence and demand, human resources, data and analytics, local planning, and vaccine safety and effectiveness. The United States has committed more than $1.6 billion in funding to help get shots into arms around the world.<br></li><li><strong>Advance health security and pandemic preparedness. </strong>The United States will continue to advance health security and pandemic preparedness abroad, including through strengthening WHO, working with partners towards targeted IHR amendments and a new pandemic instrument, building country capacities towards the Global Health Security Agenda target, strengthening sustained financing including establishing a new financial intermediary fund at the World Bank, building back better biosafety and biosecurity norms and mitigating biotechnological risks, innovating our science and technological capabilities to shorten the cycle for development of safe, effect, and affordable vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics, and more.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Continue investments to strengthen health systems.</strong> The United States will continue to advance the newly launched <a href="https://www.usaid.gov/global-health/health-systems-innovation/health-systems/Vision-HSS-2030">Vision for Health System Strengthening</a> and will work to align global partners toward shared commitments for the health workforce. The United States has committed to supporting and protecting health workers, and affirmed support for WHO’s Gender Equal Health and Care Workforce Initiative, which aim to address gender inequities and inequalities health workers face globally. The United States will continue to invest resources and provide assistance to strengthen countries’ disease surveillance and laboratory detection capacities, continue to lead efforts to eradicate polio, and also strengthen immunization systems and vaccine delivery to ensure a world where people live healthier, safer lives.<br></li><li><strong>Continue championing and expanding sexual and reproductive health and rights. </strong>In addition to maintaining strong financial support, the United States will continue to collaborate with allies and partners through multilateral, bilateral and civil society partnerships to expand progress and leadership to advance sexual and reproductive health and rights. Federal agencies are developing SRHR implementation plans and the National Security Council will continue to elevate and expand SRHR as a core component of our global health policy.<br></li><li><strong>Continue the fight against HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis.</strong> This year, President Biden will host the Global Fund’s Seventh Replenishment Conference, advancing global efforts to address HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis, alongside the U.S. government’s programs.&nbsp; PEPFAR is saving lives and curbing new HIV infections while supporting the health systems infrastructure in countries that continue to serve as a backbone of the COVID-19 response. PEPFAR’s assets can be further leveraged to support the COVID-19 response, while protecting and expanding HIV services and serving the most vulnerable populations around the world. PMI is reshaping its fight against malaria, focusing on reaching the unreached, further building community health systems, and increasing the impact of community health workers as part of its new “<a href="https://www.pmi.gov/home/pmis-strategy/">End Malaria Faster</a>” Strategy. Current investments are building countries’ capacities to respond to both tuberculosis and COVID-19 with support for bi-directional testing approaches for both diseases, joint contact investigations and community screenings, stigma reduction and community empowerment, and expanding infection prevention and control measures—providing vital platforms to address both diseases and respond to future airborne pandemics.<br></li><li><strong>Continue demonstrating strong global leadership on nutrition.</strong> At the 2021 Tokyo Nutrition for Growth Summit, the United States announced a financial commitment of up to $11 billion over three years to combat global malnutrition. The United States also launched the <a href="https://www.usaid.gov/global-health/health-areas/nutrition/usgplan">Global Nutrition Coordination Plan</a>, which will guide the collaborative work of seven U.S. government agencies engaged in scaling up proven approaches to better nutrition.</li></ul>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Biden-Harris Administration Sets Goal of Reducing Cancer Death Rate by at least 50 Percent Over the Next 25 Years, and Improving the Experience of Living with and Surviving Cancer</em></p>



<p>As Vice President, in 2016, Joe Biden launched the Cancer Moonshot with the mission to accelerate the rate of progress against cancer. The cancer and patient community and medical researchers responded with tremendous energy and ingenuity.</p>



<p>Today, President Biden is <strong>reigniting the Cancer Moonshot with renewed White House leadership of this effort</strong>. Because of recent progress in cancer therapeutics, diagnostics, and patient-driven care, as well as the scientific advances and public health lessons of the COVID-19 pandemic, it’s now possible to set ambitious goals: to <strong>reduce the death rate from cancer by at least 50 percent over the next 25 years, </strong>and <strong>improve the experience of people and their families living with and surviving cancer</strong>—&nbsp;and, by doing this and more<strong>, end cancer as we know it today.<br></strong><br>The President and First Lady Jill Biden are also announcing a <strong>call to action on cancer screening </strong>to jumpstart progress on screenings that were missed as a result of the pandemic, and help ensure that everyone in the United States equitably benefits from the tools we have to prevent, detect, and diagnose cancer.<br><br><strong>Building on a Quarter Century of Bipartisan Support, Public Health Progress, and Scientific Advances</strong><br>Over the first 20 years of this century, the age-adjusted death rate from cancer has fallen by about 25 percent, which means more people are surviving cancer and living longer after being diagnosed with cancer. That was enabled by progress on multiple fronts.</p>



<ul><li>Science brought us <strong>treatments that target specific mutations</strong> in many types of cancer –for example, in certain types of lung cancer, leukemia, and skin cancers.</li><li>It has also provided therapies that use our immune system to detect and kill cancer cells and these <strong>immunotherapies</strong> are making a big difference in certain skin cancers, blood cancers, and others.</li><li>We also have <strong>cancer vaccines</strong> – like the HPV vaccine –which prevents the cause of up to seven kinds of cancer.&nbsp;</li><li>We developed <strong>tools, like low-dose CT scans and refined use of colonoscopies</strong>, which help us detect lung cancer and colorectal cancers early when there are better treatment options.</li><li>Starting in the early 1990s, we also made progress against tobacco use through targeted public health education campaigns as well as <strong>new, more effective approaches to smoking cessation</strong>. We have seen a 50 percent decrease in adult long-term cigarette smoking and a 68 percent drop in smoking rates among youth.</li></ul>



<p>Five years ago, with the bipartisan passage and enactment of the <strong>21st Century Cures Act, Congress invested $1.8 billion</strong>, providing seven years of new funding for cancer research in many areas including studies on cancer disparities, new clinical trial networks to drive drug discovery, and innovative projects examining childhood cancer. The law streamlined cancer-related decision-making at the FDA through the formation of an Oncology Center of Excellence, so that effective treatments can be approved faster and patients can have more direct access to information about the regulatory process.</p>



<p>First Lady Jill Biden’s advocacy for cancer education and prevention began in 1993, when four of her friends were diagnosed with breast cancer. Following that year, she launched the Biden Breast Health Initiative to educate Delaware high school girls about the importance of cancer prevention.&nbsp; As First Lady she continues her work emphasizing early detection efforts and the patient, family and caregiver experience with cancer. &nbsp; She will also stress the importance of cancer screenings, especially those delayed or put off due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and will urge government partners, the business community, and non-profit sectors to help make screenings more accessible and available to all.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the White House, then-Vice President Biden brought together a task force and challenged the public and private sectors to join together in making progress. Companies, patient groups, universities, and foundations worked together to forge new partnerships and launch new programs.</p>



<p><strong>The Biden-Harris Administration Has Maintained This Commitment</strong><br>In the President’s first budget, he sustained strong funding for biomedical and health research with <strong>increased funding for the NIH </strong>and <strong>NCI, </strong>and full funding for the<strong> 21st Century Cures Act </strong>and the<strong> Beau Biden Cancer Moonshot Initiative</strong> at the NCI<strong>.<br></strong><br>President Biden proposed a bold new vision for biomedical and health research in the <strong>Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H).</strong> The goal of this entity is to improve the U.S. government’s capabilities to speed research that can improve human health — to improve our ability to prevent, detect, and treat a range of diseases including cancer, infectious diseases, Alzheimer’s disease, and many others. ARPA-H funding has already been included in appropriation and authorization bills pending in Congress.</p>



<p>President Biden committed to<strong> a bilateral effort with the United Kingdom </strong>to take on the challenges of cancer together. This has already resulted in a November 2021 US-UK Cancer Scientific Meeting of leadership, patient advocates, and oncology research experts which produced recommendations for how the two nations can work in partnership to make even more urgent progress on cancer.</p>



<p><strong>The Biden-Harris Administration has also prioritized strengthening health care for the American people</strong> by lowering health care costs and expanding coverage. The President’s health care agenda is the biggest expansion of affordable health care in a decade, and includes cutting prescription drug costs by letting Medicare negotiate prices; strengthening the Affordable Care Act and reducing premiums for 9 million Americans; improving Medicare benefits by capping out-of-pocket costs on drugs, including cancer drugs, purchased at a pharmacy; and covering millions of uninsured Americans in states that have failed to expand Medicaid.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>New Goals for the Cancer Moonshot</strong><br>Based on the progress made and the possibility before us, President Biden today set new national goals for the Cancer Moonshot:</p>



<ul><li>Working together over the next 25 years, <strong>we will cut today’s age-adjusted death rate from cancer by at least 50 percent.</strong></li><li>We will <strong>improve the experience of people and their families living with and surviving cancer.</strong></li></ul>



<p>Taken together, these actions will drive us toward <strong>ending cancer as we know it today.</strong></p>



<p>There’s so much that can be done.</p>



<ul><li><strong>To diagnose cancer sooner</strong> — Today, we know cancer as a disease we often diagnose too late. We must increase access to existing ways to screen for cancer, and support patients through the process of diagnosis. We can also greatly expand the cancers we can screen for. Five years ago, detecting many cancers at once through blood tests was a dream. Now new technologies and rigorous clinical trials could put this within our reach. Detecting and diagnosing cancers earlier means there may be more effective treatment options. <br></li><li><strong>To prevent cancer</strong> — Today, we know cancer as a disease we have few good ways to prevent. But now, scientists are asking if mRNA technology, used in the safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines to teach your body to fight off the virus, could be used to stop cancer cells when they first appear. And we know we can address environmental exposures to cancer, including by cleaning up polluted sites and delivering clean water to American homes, for example, through the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/11/16/the-bipartisan-infrastructure-law-advances-environmental-justice/">Bipartisan Infrastructure Law</a>.<br></li><li><strong>To address inequities </strong>— Today, we know cancer as a disease for which there are stark inequities in access to cancer screening, diagnostics and treatment across race, gender, region, and resources. We can ensure that every community in America – rural, urban, Tribal, and everywhere else – has access to cutting-edge cancer diagnostics, therapeutics, and clinical trials.<br></li><li><strong>To target the right treatments to the right patients</strong> — Today, we know cancer as a disease for which we understand too little about why treatments work for some patients, but not for others. We are learning more about how to use information about genetics, immune responses, and other factors to tell which combinations of treatments are likely to work best in an individual patient.<br></li><li><strong>To speed progress against the most deadly and rare cancers, including childhood cancers</strong> — Today, we know cancer as a disease for which we lack good strategies for developing treatments against many of the more than 200 distinct types. We can invest in a robust pipeline for new treatments, and the COVID-19 pandemic response has demonstrated we can accelerate clinical trials without compromising safety and effectiveness. <br></li><li><strong>To support patients, caregivers, and survivors</strong> — Today, we know cancer as a disease in which we do not do enough to help people and families navigate cancer and its aftermath. We can help people overcome the medical, financial, and emotional burdens that cancer brings by providing support to navigate cancer diagnosis, treatment, and survivorship.<br></li><li><strong>To learn from all patients </strong>— Today, we know cancer as a disease in which we don’t learn from the experiences of most patients. We can turn our cancer care system into a learning system. When asked, most people with cancer are glad to make their data available for research to help future patients, if it can be done easily while respecting their privacy. Additionally, the diverse personal experiences of patients and their families make their input essential in developing approaches to end cancer as we know it.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Mobilizing the Entire Government</strong><br>Under the Biden-Harris Administration, the Cancer Moonshot will specifically:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Re-establish White House Leadership</strong>, with a White House Cancer Moonshot coordinator in the Executive Office of the President, to demonstrate the President and First Lady’s personal commitment to making progress and to leverage the whole-of-government approach and national response that the challenge of cancer demands.<br></li><li><strong>Form a Cancer Cabinet</strong>, which will be convened by the White House, bringing together departments and agencies across government to address cancer on multiple fronts. These include the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Department of Defense (DOD), Department of Energy (DOE), Department of Agriculture (USDA), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), Domestic Policy Council (DPC), Gender Policy Council (GPC), Office of the First Lady (OFL), Office of the Vice President (OVP), Office of Management and Budget (OMB), Office of Legislative Affairs (OLA), Office of Public Engagement (OPE), along with additional members, as needed, to help establish and make progress on Cancer Moonshot goals. <br></li><li><strong>Issue a Call to Action on Cancer Screening and Early Detection</strong>:<ul><li>To deliver the message of urgency and increased access to <strong>get back on track after more than 9.5 million missed cancer screenings in the United States as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic</strong>. With regular recommended screenings, we can often catch cancer when there may be more effective treatment options or even prevent it from developing by removing pre-cancerous tissue.</li><li>To help ensure equitable access to screening and prevention through <strong>at-home screening</strong> (especially for colon cancer and HPV, the virus that causes cervical, head, neck and other cancers), <strong>mobile screening</strong> in communities without easy access to a clinic, through the <strong>community health networks</strong> we have built and strengthened during the COVID-19 pandemic, and other ways to reduce barriers to cancer screening.</li><li>NCI will organize the collective efforts of the NCI cancer centers, and other networks such as the NCI Community Oncology Research Network (NCORP), to <strong>offer new access points to compensate for millions of delayed cancer screenings </strong>due to the pandemic, with a focus on reaching those individuals most at risk.</li><li>Federal agencies, led by the NCI, will develop a focused program to expeditiously<strong> study and evaluate multicancer detection tests</strong>, like we did for COVID-19 diagnostics, which could help detect cancers when there may be more effective treatment options.</li><li>The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) commits to<strong> accelerating efforts to nearly eliminate cervical cancer through screening and HPV vaccination</strong>, with a particular focus on reaching people who are most at risk.</li><li>The <strong>President’s Cancer panel this week released a report <a>“</a></strong><a href="https://prescancerpanel.cancer.gov/report/cancerscreening"><strong>Closing Gaps in Cancer Screening</strong></a><strong>”</strong> laying out recommendations focused on connecting people, communities, and systems to increase equity and access.<br></li></ul></li><li><strong>Host a White House Cancer Moonshot Summit</strong>, bringing together agency leadership, patient organizations, biopharmaceutical companies, the research, public health, and healthcare communities and more to highlight innovation, progress, and new commitments toward ending cancer as we know it. <br></li><li><strong>Build on a White House Cancer Roundtable Conversation Series</strong> hosted over the last six months, with experts, including people living with cancer, caregivers, and survivors. These discussions focused on cancer prevention, early detection, clinical trial design and access, patient support and navigation, childhood cancer, learning from all patients and issues relating to equity in access and outcomes. Going forward, this will include discussions on additional topics and the knowledge gained will continue to inform this whole-of-government approach on cancer.<br></li><li><strong>Require an All-Hands-On-Deck Approach. President Biden calls on the private sector, foundations, academic institutions, healthcare providers, and all Americans</strong> to take on the mission of reducing the deadly impact of cancer and improving patient experiences in the diagnosis, treatment, and survival of cancer. Progress will be informed by people living with cancer, caregivers, and families and contributed by all parts of the oncology community and beyond. We invite all Americans to share perspectives and ideas, and organizations, companies, and institutions to share actions they plan to take as part of this mission at <a><strong>whitehouse.gov/cancermoonshot</strong></a>.</li></ul>

<p>We send our warmest greetings to everyone celebrating the Lunar New Year.</p>



<p>Across our country and around the world, families and friends are gathering together in person and in spirit to celebrate the possibility and hope of new beginnings.</p>



<p>As we enter this Year of the Tiger — representing strength and courage — let us continue doing the work of our time to beat this pandemic, rebuild our economy, and protect our very democracy, which includes standing up to the hate that continues to target Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders.</p>



<p>Every person — no matter their race, background, religion, or language – is created equal and deserves to be treated equally throughout their lives. That is the very idea of America and the heart of our Administration.</p>



<p>Each day, all of our communities are enriched by the diversity and talents of the people of this nation — from frontline workers and military families to business leaders and community activists to artists, entertainers, writers, and public servants.</p>



<p>Together, you show what it means to be the hope and light for better days ahead. From our family to yours, we wish you peace, prosperity, health, and a happy Lunar New Year.</p>
