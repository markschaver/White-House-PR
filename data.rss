<p>Today, the President announced that our Administration is pausing federal student loan repayments through August 31, 2022. This pause will help 41 million people keep up with their monthly bills and meet their basic needs. It will give borrowers some urgently needed time to prepare for a return to repayment.  <br><br>This is personal for me. I had student loans. Each month, I would sit at the kitchen table, fill out paperwork, and send a check to pay down my balance. Later, as California Attorney General, I took on predatory for-profit colleges and won $1 billion for defrauded veterans and students. President Biden and I understand that student loan debt adds stress for borrowers and their families.<br><br>We have made strong progress as a country in the face of a global pandemic and an economic downturn, but there is still work to do. Today’s announcement will make a meaningful difference as we continue moving forward. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Via Teleconference</p>



<p>10:05 A.M. EDT</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; And thanks, everyone, for joining us today.</p>



<p>So, as a quick reminder, this call is on background, attributable to a “senior administration official,” and the contents of this call are embargoed until the end of the call.</p>



<p>For your awareness and not for reporting, our speaker on the call today is [senior administration official].&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, with that, I&#8217;ll turn it over to you for some opening remarks.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Thank you, [moderator].&nbsp; Thanks, everybody, for joining.&nbsp; Yeah, I&#8217;ll say a few things at the top, and then happy to jump into your questions.</p>



<p>The sickening brutality in Bucha has made tragically clear the despicable nature of the Putin regime.&nbsp; And today, in alignment with G7 allies and partners, we’re intensifying the most severe sanctions ever levied on a major economy.</p>



<p>All of you have seen the factsheet, so I&#8217;m going to step back and just explain the rationale for choosing these actions in the context of the five pillars that underpin our sanctions strategy.</p>



<p>So, number one, as all of you know, we’ve sought to generate a financial shock by cutting off Russia’s largest banks and its central bank from doing any business with the U.S. and freezing any of its assets that touch the U.S. financial system or those of our allies.</p>



<p>And today, we’re dramatically escalating the financial shock by imposing full blocking sanctions on Russia’s largest financial institution, Sberbank, and its largest private bank, Alfa Bank.</p>



<p>Sberbank is the main artery in the Russian financial system.&nbsp; By itself, it holds nearly one third of Russia’s total banking sector assets; that&#8217;s over $500 billion.&nbsp; That’s roughly twice the size of the second-largest Russian bank, which we previously fully blocked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And in total, we’ve now fully blocked more than two thirds of the Russian banking sector, which, before the invasion, held $1.4 trillion in assets.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Number two, we said we would cut off cutting-edge exports to Russia to disable Putin’s military and deny him the ability to diversify and modernize his economy.</p>



<p>So, today, in alignment with the G7 and the EU, we&#8217;re announcing a ban on new investment in Russia, which President Biden will implement with an executive order.&nbsp; And this will make sure that the mass exodus from Russia that we’re seeing from the private sector, which is now over 600 multinational companies and growing &#8212; that it will endure.</p>



<p>And without investment from our private sector, Putin will lose private sector know-how and skills that travel with investment, and the knock-on effects to the ongoing brain drain from Russia will be profound.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Third, we&#8217;ve said we&#8217;re methodically ejecting Russia from the international economic order to deny the privileges and benefits it once enjoyed, such as its most-favored-nation trading status, its borrowing privileges from the IMF and the World Bank.</p>



<p>And in that spirit, on Monday we cut off Russia’s ability to use its frozen central bank funds to make debt payments.&nbsp; And so, Russia will now have to find new sources of dollars from outside the U.S. and to find a new payment route, other than U.S. banks, to avoid falling into default. &nbsp;And that&#8217;s Russia&#8217;s choice as to how it proceeds.</p>



<p>And of course, even if Russia taps into other sources of hard currency to remain current on its debt obligations, that will translate into fewer resources available to Putin to fund his war machine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fourth, we’ve said we’d degrade Russia’s status as a leading energy supplier and thereby cut off its largest source of export and budget revenue.&nbsp; We’ve done that previously by banning U.S. imports of Russian oil, gas, and coal; by working with the Germans and the EU to shut down Nord Stream 2; and by cutting off energy technologies that Russia needs to sustain its oil and gas production.</p>



<p>And today, just as a preview, you’ll hear more from the EU on their efforts to take this a step further.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lastly, we said we’d expose Russia’s kleptocracy and show that Putin and his cronies have been ripping off the Russian people for decades.&nbsp; Already, before today, we had sanctioned more than 140 oligarchs and their family members, and over 400 Russian government officials.&nbsp; These are the key architects of the war.</p>



<p>And today, we’re sanctioning Putin’s adult children, Minister Lavrov’s wife and his daughter, and members of Russia’s Security Council.</p>



<p>In terms of impact &#8212; and we can get into this in the questions if you&#8217;d like &#8212; I mean, as all of you have seen, these sanctions are generating the impact we warned Putin about for months prior to the invasion.&nbsp; Russia&#8217;s GDP is projected to shrink by double digits this year.&nbsp; And to put that in perspective, that’s more than twice the contraction it suffered after it defaulted in 1998.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But unlike then, when Russia was in the process of getting integrated into the global economy, it’s now in the process of being isolated as a pariah state.</p>



<p>The economic shock this year alone is projected by the IEF to wipe out the past 15 years of economic gains.  Russia used to be the 11th-largest economy in the world.  It&#8217;s now very likely to drop out of the top 20. </p>



<p>Inflation: The latest print this week was that inflation in Russia is already above 15 percent and projected to hit 20 percent or more.&nbsp; Interest rates in Russia are already 20 percent.</p>



<p>And so, this combination of sky-high inflation and interest rates will cripple Russia&#8217;s long-term growth potential and so will the exit of the more than 600 companies that I referenced earlier. &nbsp;</p>



<p>And the sad reality is Putin&#8217;s war will make it harder for Russians to travel abroad. &nbsp;It means their debit cards may not work. &nbsp;They may only have the option to buy knockoff phones and knockoff clothes.&nbsp; The shelves at stores may be empty. &nbsp;The reality is the country is descending into economic and financial and technological isolation. &nbsp;And at this rate, it will go back to Soviet-style living standards from the 1980s.</p>



<p>But look, don&#8217;t take my word for it: Putin himself has said the sanctions will require deep structural changes to the Russian economy to deal with the new realities, including inflation and unemployment.&nbsp; Minister Lavrov has said “no one could have predicted” the central bank actions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They simply weren&#8217;t prepared for their economic fortress to crumble. &nbsp;And that&#8217;s what&#8217;s happened.</p>



<p>Let me stop there and take your questions.</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Could we cue up the directions to ask a question please?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q    Thanks for doing this.  My question is about India.  You were [redacted], and that&#8217;s been reported on extensively.  Where does India stand on the second set of sanctions?  And how far have they come towards convergence on the U.S. view regarding the sanctions (inaudible) applied?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Thanks for the question.&nbsp; You know, India is our friend; India is our partner.&nbsp; And we share &#8212; we share interests, and we share core principles that are at stake in this conflict.&nbsp; And we&#8217;ve had extensive discussions about ways to further our cooperation on global food security, on global energy supplies, and certainly in terms of recognizing that Putin&#8217;s brutality affects all of us.&nbsp; And the geopolitical implications of Russia&#8217;s actions do have ripple effects.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, we &#8212; India is not part of the G7.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a guest country this year.&nbsp; So, we will certainly collaborate with India and share the details of our measures.&nbsp; And, of course, we remain hopeful that we can have alignment to the maximum extent possible.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, thanks.&nbsp; I&#8217;m just wondering if you could clarify on Putin&#8217;s adult children.&nbsp; Are you sanctioning his two daughters, Mariya Putina and Katerina Tikhonova?&nbsp; Or are there any additional children that you have identified that you are applying sanctions to?&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Yeah, you’ve got it right.&nbsp; Those are the two.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi there.&nbsp; Thank you for taking our questions.&nbsp; Can you speak a little bit more about these full blocking sanctions come on the major SOEs that are coming tomorrow?&nbsp; Is that, sort of like, all major SOEs or a certain major?&nbsp; Are there particular sectors?&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; So these are not all Russian SOEs.&nbsp; And they will not be energy &#8212; they will not be SOEs in the energy sector.&nbsp; You&#8217;ll hear more from Treasury tomorrow on the specific institutions, and that will likely come later today or tomorrow.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi there.&nbsp; Thanks for doing this call.&nbsp; I wanted to just ask if you could say whether you saw, currently, that China is complying with sanctions that you&#8217;ve implemented so far, and what the thinking is on applying secondary sanctions to Chinese or other foreign companies or entities.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; So as I think everyone is aware, we&#8217;ve had a series of private consultations, going up to the highest level of our government and China&#8217;s government, about the importance of respecting the sanctions regime that we’ve put in place as well as the export controls.&nbsp; And I don&#8217;t have anything new to tell you, other than we&#8217;ve been really clear about the consequences of any efforts to circumvent or backfill those sanctions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And you&#8217;ve seen, I think, in the public rhetoric from China that they&#8217;re not, openly at least, indicating any intention to do so.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re watching that very closely.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you very much for doing this call.&nbsp; Can you tell us whether you think these sanctions and all the impact on Russia will actually stop Russia&#8217;s military advances given the projection to Congress yesterday from General Milley that this war could last years?&nbsp; And Vladimir Putin &#8212; it doesn&#8217;t seem signs of slowing down.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; I think &#8212; yeah, thanks, Andrea.&nbsp; I mean, I&#8217;ll say it this way: I mean, sanctions are never a standalone solution.&nbsp; We don&#8217;t impose these costs as an end to themselves.&nbsp; And, you know, in our judgment, sanctions work when they&#8217;re embedded in a broader strategy, and you referenced this.&nbsp; It has to &#8212; these sanctions have to work alongside doing all we can to support Ukraine&#8217;s fight for freedom.&nbsp; They work alongside doing all we can to help the rest of the world deal with the spillovers of Putin&#8217;s war.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And that&#8217;s why we&#8217;ve surged supplies of energy.&nbsp; It&#8217;s why we&#8217;re coming together to welcome the millions of refugees that are fleeing Ukraine, and trying to come together with the rest of the world to deal with the disruptions to global food supply.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And if we execute on all those fronts &#8212; and that&#8217;s our that&#8217;s our plan; that&#8217;s our strategy &#8212; that&#8217;s how we create staying power in these sanctions.&nbsp; And staying the course is how we think we’ll create leverage for the outcome that we&#8217;re seeking.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I’ll &#8212; let me add one more point on the sanctions impact: I mean, even an autocrat like Putin has a social contract with the Russian people.&nbsp; He took away their freedom in exchange for promising stability.&nbsp; And so he&#8217;s not giving them stability at the moment; he&#8217;s giving them instability and insecurity, and he&#8217;s imposing that upon them.&nbsp; And at some point, that ought to matter to any leader if only because they care about staying in power.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So the question really is not so much, “What can we do and when will that have an effect?”&nbsp; I think it&#8217;s, “What&#8217;s the endgame here for Putin?&nbsp; What&#8217;s he playing for?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is very clearly becoming a failure for him.&nbsp; And at some point, he will have to recognize that reality.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hello.&nbsp; Hi, [senior administration official].&nbsp; Thank you for doing this.&nbsp; Earlier, you mentioned that you have worked with senior Chinese officials regarding those sanctions.&nbsp; Do you also find that China is also learning how United States and allies are using the financial sanctions right now and possibly find ways to counter those measures in the future if, one day, China has to face similar sanctions?&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; No, I think, you know, China has become &#8212; has gained an economic prominence by engaging with the world, by integrating itself with the global economy and with the global financial system.</p>



<p>And the United States &#8212; because of the quality of our financial markets, the transparency of our regulations, the effectiveness of our corporate governance, and really the soft power that we’ve enjoyed for decades and decades &#8212; is the central player in the global financial system.&nbsp; And so we will remain integrated with China as long as it continues to engage with the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so, you know, that’s the way in which we have leverage with financial sanctions.&nbsp; And we don’t use that leverage in an arbitrary way.&nbsp; We use that leverage when we’re defending a core international principle.&nbsp; And that’s certainly what’s going on in the crisis in Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’re using these sanctions because we want to demonstrate resolve and say, “You can’t redraw your neighbors’ borders at the barrel of a gun.&nbsp; You can’t subjugate their free will.&nbsp; Countries have the right to set their own course and choose their own destiny.”&nbsp; That’s &#8212; those are the conditions in which we use these sanctions.&nbsp; We know how severe they are.&nbsp; And our message to China is: We hope you respect those principles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi.&nbsp; Thank you guys for doing the call.&nbsp; I just had a more, sort of, technical question.&nbsp; Could you clarify specifically the sanctions that are being placed on Sberbank: how those differ or what is being done, compared to what had already been put on them earlier this month?&nbsp; I&#8217;m just unclear on that.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; And thanks for asking that, because previously we had imposed what are called “dollar-clearing prohibition” with Sberbank, which meant that any transactions that Sberbank tried to undertake with a U.S. financial institution using dollars would not be allowed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So now, this is a full blocking sanction, which means that any transaction in any currency with a U.S. person or a U.S. institution is prohibited, and also any of Sberbank’s assets that touch the U.S. financial system are now frozen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, it&#8217;s a &#8212; it&#8217;s a much more severe action.&nbsp; This is the most severe action we can take in terms of financial measures.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And in practice, the history of sanctions show us that when we impose a full blocking sanction on a financial institution, that the rest of the world, even in other jurisdictions that have not yet imposed a full blocking sanction, they respect the regime and so there tends to be a multiplier effect.&nbsp; That&#8217;s what we expect to happen here as well.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay, thank you.&nbsp; And to be clear, there&#8217;s no carve-outs there?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; I&#8217;m sorry, I should have said there is a carve-out for energy, yes.&nbsp; Just like the other full block &#8212; full blocking sanctions.&nbsp; It&#8217;s the same carve-out.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, thanks very much.&nbsp; I was wondering if there has been discussion of the downside effects of so detaching the Russians from the global economy that their investment in it over the long term basically becomes so diminished that they become more interested in disruptive action than any hope that they would get back in?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Well, I mean, I would say this, David &#8212; is the sanctions are designed to be quite flexible.&nbsp; We can escalate and we can de-escalate depending on the circumstances.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And &#8212; but really, the way to think of it, if you want a metaphor, it&#8217;s a negative feedback loop.&nbsp; So, we deny capital, we deny technology, we deny talent that can flow into Russia.&nbsp; And the combination of the steps that we&#8217;re taking create this downward spiral that accelerates the more that Putin escalates.</p>



<p>And if he were to change course, someday, that negative feedback loop would slow and could possibly reverse.&nbsp; None of this is permanent. &nbsp;The only aspect that&#8217;s permanent are the lives that he&#8217;s taken away, and he can never bring those back.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the sanctions &#8212; the sanctions are designed to be able to respond to the conditions on the ground and to create leverage for the outcome we seek.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi.&nbsp; Thanks again for doing the call.&nbsp; About the sanctions against Putin&#8217;s daughters: Are these symbolic sanctions or do you have reason to believe that they do have assets either in the U.S. or in Europe?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Well, we have reason to believe that Putin and many of his cronies and the oligarchs hide their wealth, hide their assets with family members, that place their assets and their wealth in the U.S. financial system but also many other parts of the world.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s why the coordination &#8212; the coordinated effort to freeze their assets and seize their physical luxury goods &#8212; their cars, their yachts, their homes, et cetera &#8212; that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so important that we act together.</p>



<p>But to answer your question directly: Yes, we believe that many of Putin&#8217;s assets are hidden with family members, and that&#8217;s why we&#8217;re targeting them.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; So, thanks, everyone, for joining.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Given the call is ending a little bit earlier than 10:30, we&#8217;re going to go ahead and lift the embargo on the factsheet as well.&nbsp; So, now that the call has ended, you know, both the content of the call and the factsheet embargo will lift.</p>



<p>And as a reminder, this call was on background, attributable to a “senior administration official.”&nbsp; So, thanks, everyone, for joining.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Thank you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>Today, the United States, with the G7 and the European Union, will continue to impose severe and immediate economic costs on the Putin regime for its atrocities in Ukraine, including in Bucha. We will document and share information on these atrocities and use all appropriate mechanisms to hold accountable those responsible. As one part of this effort, the United States is announcing devastating economic measures to ban new investment in Russia, and impose the most severe financial sanctions on Russia’s largest bank and several of its most critical state-owned enterprises and on Russian government officials and their family members. These sweeping financial sanctions follow our action earlier this week to cut off Russia’s frozen funds in the United States to make debt payments. Importantly, these measures are designed to reinforce each other to generate intensifying impact over time.</p>



<p>The United States and more than 30 allies and partners across the world have levied the most impactful, coordinated, and wide-ranging economic restrictions in history. Experts predict Russia’s GDP will contract up to 15 percent this year, wiping out the last fifteen years of economic gains. Inflation is already spiking above 15 percent and forecast to accelerate higher. More than 600 private sector companies have already left the Russian market. Supply chains in Russia have been severely disrupted. Russia will very likely lose its status as a major economy, and it will continue a long descent into economic, financial, and technological isolation. Compared to last year, U.S. exports to Russia of items subject to our new export controls have decreased 99 percent by value – and the power of these restrictions will compound over time as Russia draws down any remaining stockpiles of spare parts for certain planes, tanks, and other resources needed for Putin’s war machine.</p>



<p>As long as Russia continues its brutal assault on Ukraine, we will stand unified with our allies and partners in imposing additional costs on Russia for its actions. Today, the United States is announcing the following actions:</p>



<p><strong>Full blocking sanctions on Russia’s largest financial institution, Sberbank, and Russia’s largest private bank, Alfa Bank.</strong> This action will freeze any of Sberbank’s and Alfa Bank’s assets touching the U.S financial system and prohibit U.S. persons from doing business with them. Sberbank holds nearly one-third of the overall Russian banking sector’s assets and is systemically critical to the Russian economy. Alfa Bank is Russia’s largest privately-owned financial institution and Russia’s fourth largest financial institution overall.</p>



<p><strong>Prohibiting new investment in the Russian Federation. </strong>President Biden will sign a new Executive Order (E.O.) that includes a prohibition on new investment in Russia by U.S. persons wherever located, which will further isolate Russia from the global economy. This action builds on the decision made by more than 600 multinational businesses to exit from Russia. The exodus of the private sector includes manufacturers, energy companies, large retailers, financial institutions, as well as other service providers such as law and consulting firms. Today’s E.O. will ensure the enduring weakening of the Russian Federation’s global competitiveness.</p>



<p><strong>Full blocking sanctions on critical major Russian state-owned enterprises.</strong>&nbsp;This will prohibit any U.S. person from transacting with these entities and freeze any of their assets subject to U.S. jurisdiction, thereby damaging the Kremlin’s ability to use these entities it depends on to enable and fund its war in Ukraine. The Department of Treasury will announce these entities tomorrow.</p>



<p><strong>Full blocking sanctions on Russian elites and their family members, including sanctions on: President Putin’s adult children, Foreign Minister Lavrov’s wife and daughter, and members of Russia’s Security Council including former President and Prime Minister of Russia Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin.</strong> These individuals have enriched themselves at the expense of the Russian people. &nbsp;Some of them are responsible for providing the support necessary to underpin Putin’s war on Ukraine. This action cuts them off from the U.S. financial system and freezes any assets they hold in the United States.</p>



<p><strong>The U.S. Treasury prohibited Russia from making debt payments with funds subject to U.S. jurisdiction.</strong> Sanctions do not preclude payments on Russian sovereign debt at this time, provided Russia uses funds outside of U.S. jurisdiction. However, Russia is a global financial pariah — and it will now need to choose between draining its available funds to make debt payments or default.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Commitment to supporting sectors essential to humanitarian activities.</strong> As we continue escalating our sanctions and other economic measures against Russia for its brutal war against Ukraine, we reiterate our commitment to exempting essential humanitarian and related activities that benefit the Russian people and people around the world: ensuring the availability of basic foodstuffs and agricultural commodities, safeguarding access to medicine and medical devices, and enabling telecommunications services to support the flow of information and access to the internet which provides outside perspectives to the Russian people. These activities are not the target of our efforts, and U.S. and Western companies can continue to operate in these sectors in Russia. When necessary, relevant departments and agencies will issue appropriate exemptions and carveouts to ensure such activity is not disrupted.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>In January 2021, on my first day in office, I directed the Department of Education to pause federal student loan repayments through September of that year. At the time, our economy was barely growing. Fewer than 1 percent of Americans were fully vaccinated. Millions of Americans were struggling to stay afloat. Because of that pause in repayments, 41 million Americans were able to breathe a little easier during some of the toughest days of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>



<p>Today, America is stronger than we were a year ago—and we will be stronger a year from now than we are today. Thanks to our plan to build the economy from the bottom up and the middle out, the economy has created 7.9 million jobs since I took office—the greatest year of job growth on record. We’ve seen the fastest economic growth in nearly 40 years. More than 217 million Americans are now fully vaccinated, and 2 out of 3 eligible adults are boosted. We have the tools we need to move forward safely and return to more normal routines.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, as I recognized in recently extending the COVID-19 national emergency, we are still recovering from the pandemic and the unprecedented economic disruption it caused. If loan payments were to resume on schedule in May, analysis of recent data from the Federal Reserve suggests that millions of student loan borrowers would face significant economic hardship, and delinquencies and defaults could threaten Americans’ financial stability.</p>



<p>Accordingly, to enable Americans to continue to get back on their feet after two of the hardest years this nation has ever faced, my Administration is extending the pause on federal student loan repayments through August 31<sup>st</sup>, 2022. That additional time will assist borrowers in achieving greater financial security and support the Department of Education’s efforts to continue improving student loan programs. As part of this transition, the Department of Education will offer additional flexibilities and support for all borrowers.</p>



<p>I’m asking all student loan borrowers to work with the Department of Education to prepare for a return to repayment, look into Public Service Loan Forgiveness, and explore other options to lower their payments. Vice President Harris and I are focused on supporting borrowers in need, and believe that this pause will provide a continued lifeline as we recover and rebuild from the pandemic.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Via Teleconference</p>



<p>3:06 P.M. EDT</p>



<p>MR. ZIENTS:  Good afternoon.  Thanks for joining us.  Today, Dr. Walensky will share the latest on the state of the pandemic, Dr. Fauci will discuss the effectiveness of additional booster shots, and Secretary Becerra will provide an update on our work to address the long-term impacts of COVID.</p>



<p>First, I want to discuss where we stand on funding for the COVID-19 response.</p>



<p>We’ve made tremendous progress in our fight against the virus.&nbsp; We have 217 million Americans fully vaccinated, two out of three eligible adults boosted, a medicine cabinet full of highly-effective treatments, and convenient tests.</p>



<p>But, as we’ve made clear for months, there’s more work to do.&nbsp; The country urgently needs additional funding from Congress to continue our fight against COVID.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The administration requested emergency funds to ensure our medical tools like vaccines, treatments, and tests remain readily available to the American people and, importantly, funding for our global response so we can get more shots in arms around the world.</p>



<p>We are encouraged by the Senate’s work on a bipartisan plan to help meet some of our most immediate domestic needs.&nbsp; But, as we’ve made clear, we need more for our domestic response: to stay up to date on vaccines, to procure monoclonal antibody treatments and antiviral pills, to provide protection for the immunocompromised, and to sustain our testing capacity.</p>



<p>And it is a real disappointment that there is no global funding in this bill.&nbsp; This virus knows no borders, and it’s in our national interest to vaccinate the world and protect against possible new variants.</p>



<p>Without additional funding for our global response, we won’t have resources to help get more shots in arms in countries in need.&nbsp; We will lack funding to provide oxygen and other lifesaving supplies.&nbsp; And our global genomic sequencing capabilities will fall off and undermine our ability to detect any emerging variants around the world.</p>



<p>As we know, this virus is unpredictable.&nbsp; Time is of the essence, so we urge Congress to move promptly on the $10 billion emergency funding package developed in the Senate.</p>



<p>This bill is a start.&nbsp; It should pass immediately.&nbsp; But it’s exactly that: just a start.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Congress must keep working to immediately provide additional funding for our remaining domestic needs so that we’re prepared for whatever comes, and, importantly, to act with urgency to fund our global COVID-19 response so that we can accelerate our efforts to turn vaccines into vaccinations around the world.</p>



<p>As we work with Congress to fund our global response, we will continue doing all we can to vaccinate the world.</p>



<p>At President Biden’s direction, we have done more than just lead the global vaccination effort: We have pioneered the global vaccination effort.</p>



<p>The U.S. was the first country in the world to donate a significant amount of our own vaccine supply, creating the model for other countries to do the same.</p>



<p>The U.S. was the first country to strike a deal with a major vaccine manufacturer to purchase doses solely to donate to other countries in need &#8212; 1 billion Pfizer vaccine doses.</p>



<p>We were the first, and remain the only, country to broker a deal with a U.S. manufacturer and COVAX to get vaccines into humanitarian zones to reach people displaced by war, famine, and other crises.</p>



<p>And we were the first, and are still the only, country to give up our place in line for delivery of doses, enabling the African Union to more quickly access over 100 million Moderna vaccine doses.</p>



<p>Today, we’re adding to our list of firsts, announcing that we will be the first nation to donate tens of millions of pediatric COVID-19 vaccines to low- and lower-middle income countries for free, with no strings attached.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These countries around the world are eager to get these doses.&nbsp; In fact, more than 20 low- and lower-middle income countries have approached the U.S., asking us to provide vaccines for their young children.</p>



<p>We’re now ready to answer their call.&nbsp; It’s the right thing to do.</p>



<p>The U.S. has now delivered over a half-billion adult vaccines to 114 different countries.&nbsp; And because of President Biden’s leadership, vaccine supply is no longer the constraint to getting shots in arms around the world.</p>



<p>In fact, countries need funding and assistance to turn vaccines into vaccinations.&nbsp; That’s why Congress must step up and provide critical funding to help countries in need get shots into arms.</p>



<p>In the meantime, any low- and lower-middle income country that wants adult doses from the U.S. can get those doses, again, for free with no strings attached.</p>



<p>And now with more than enough supply for adults, we’re working with Pfizer to make pediatric doses available to donate as part of our ongoing commitment to donate 1.2 billion vaccines.</p>



<p>Thanks to this historic action, children in countries most in need will soon have access to safe, effective vaccines and parents will gain the peace of mind that their children are protected.</p>



<p>Again, this virus knows no borders, so getting more people vaccinated is one of the best ways to protect people here at home and around the world.</p>



<p>And today, we’re making clear that the U.S. will continue to lead and pioneer the global effort to get both adults and children vaccinated.</p>



<p>With that, I’ll turn it over to Dr. Walensky.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. Walensky.</p>



<p>DR. WALENSKY:&nbsp; Thank you, Jeff.&nbsp; And good afternoon, everyone.&nbsp; Let’s walk &#8212; start by walking through today’s data.&nbsp; The current seven-day daily average of cases is about 25,000 cases per day, a decrease nationally of about 4 percent over the previous week and remains relatively stable over the past few weeks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The seven-day average of hospital admissions is about 14,000 per day, a decrease of about 17 percent over the previous week.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And the seven-day average daily deaths are about 570 per day, which is a decrease of nearly 16 percent over the prior week.</p>



<p>New national estimates released today show the Omicron sublineage, BA.2 &#8212; indicated by light pink in this U.S. map by HHS regions &#8212; is now projected to account for 72 percent of circulating variants nationally, with all regions of the country reporting that BA.2 is now the dominant variant.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As we’ve previously shared about the BA.2 variant, there is no evidence that BA.2 results in more severe disease compared with the BA.1 variant, nor does it appear to be more likely to evade immune protection than BA.1.&nbsp; But BA.2 does appear to be more transmissible than BA.1.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The high level of immunity in the population from vaccines, boosters, and previous infection will provide some level of protection against BA.2.&nbsp; However, we strongly encourage everyone to be up to date on their COVID-19 vaccines.</p>



<p>Looking across the country, we see that 95 percent of counties are reporting low COVID-19 community levels, which represent over 97 percent of the U.S. population.</p>



<p>If we look more closely at the local level, we find a handful of counties where we are seeing increases in both cases and markers of more severe disease, like hospitalizations and in-patient bed capacity, which have resulted in an increased COVID-19 community level in some areas.</p>



<p>While on the national level cases remain relatively low compared to prior points in the pandemic, we continue to look to COVID-19 community levels which were developed to work locally at the county level.</p>



<p>As we move forward, we encourage local jurisdictions to closely monitor their own COVID-19 community levels and to follow additional metrics that are &#8212; that they may have available as leading indicators of disease, for example, wastewater and syndromic surveillance.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s important for communities and health officials to use these measures to help inform prevention strategies for their local area &#8212; like masking, testing, and plans for treatment &#8212; should they move into higher COVID-19 community levels.</p>



<p>Now as we continue to closely monitor COVID-19 in the United States, we&#8217;re reminded of the critical need to have a sustainable and resilient public health workforce in place that can effectively respond to both emerging threats and ongoing public health needs.</p>



<p>During the decade prior to COVID-19, the public health workforce lost an estimated 60,000 jobs nationwide, despite the continued demands to respond to multiple chronic public health threats, like H1N1, Zika, and Ebola.</p>



<p>As we look to building back this much-needed workforce, we must prioritize a public health workforce that is as diverse as the communities they serve, culturally competent, and equipped with skills to meet the public health needs of communities across the nation.</p>



<p>One way we&#8217;re working to build this workforce is through Public Health AmeriCorps &#8212; a groundbreaking initiative that supports the recruitment, training, and development of our nation&#8217;s next generation of public health leaders.&nbsp; Public Health AmeriCorps is supported through investments from the American Rescue Plan and is anticipated to fund up to 5,000 positions over the next five years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This week, AmeriCorps will award over 80 grants to the first round of Public Health AmeriCorps programs across 32 states and territories that will allow the recruitment of nearly 3,000 Public Health AmeriCorps members.</p>



<p>The work of these initial members will help to address public health needs in our nation&#8217;s inner cities, to build Tribal public health capacity, to address health disparities in rural America, and to bolster public health resources in our U.S. territories.</p>



<p>Recruitment, training, and development of public health personnel is a key part of building our nation&#8217;s public health workforce, allowing us to better respond to current and future public health threats.</p>



<p>And now I will turn it over to Dr. Fauci.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. Fauci.</p>



<p>DR. FAUCI:&nbsp; Thank you very much, Dr. Walensky.&nbsp; I would like to now discuss the COVID-19 boosters, particularly in the context of the fourth dose of an mRNA boost.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s take a very quick update and an overview of the situation that we&#8217;re in right now.&nbsp; So, several studies have shown that COVID-19 vaccine booster shots protect against serious illness, hospitalizations, and even death.&nbsp; That&#8217;s a well-established fact now.&nbsp; And the CDC recommends everyone aged 12 and older to receive a COVID-19 vaccine booster after completing their primary vaccination series.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And certain individuals can now receive two booster doses: people who are moderately or severely immune compromised, as well as adults 50 years of age or older.</p>



<p>Next slide.</p>



<p>And as we know, on March 29th, the FDA authorized second booster doses of two COVID-19 vaccines for older and immunocompromised individuals.&nbsp; And the CDC recommended, that same day, that additional boosters can now be used for certain individuals.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at the data behind those decisions.&nbsp; So, the first doost- &#8212; the first booster doses restore the waning vaccine effectiveness of a primary vaccine series, including against severe disease.&nbsp; The effectiveness of the first booster dose, we know, wanes over time.&nbsp; And growing evidence indicates that a second COVID-19 dose can restore vaccine effectiveness for certain populations and, albeit, the data now &#8212; at least for the short term.&nbsp; And we look forward to longer-term data.</p>



<p>Next slide.</p>



<p>So, let&#8217;s take a look at some of the Israeli studies.&nbsp; There are a few of them that are really quite telling.&nbsp; One from Bar-On, looking at more than 1 million people who are age 60 or older and eligible for the fourth dose.&nbsp; And in that look at &#8211;in that study, an additional booster dose of the Pfizer product at four months resulted in a 2-fold lower rate of confirmed infection and a 4.3-fold lower rate of severe illness.</p>



<p>In another study &#8212; next slide &#8212; again, from Israel by &#8212; there it is &#8212; by Arbel, about a half a million members of a health services group, again age &#8212; 60 years of age or older.&nbsp; And now during an Omicron surge, individuals who received a second booster dose of the Pfizer product at four months had a 78 percent reduction in death compared to those who received only the first boost.</p>



<p>And on the next slide, this is rather dramatically shown by this Kaplan-Meier shot, where you see here in the pink-red, the first booster &#8212; namely, a third dose.&nbsp; And then in the lighter blue color, you look at the mortality rate of individuals who receive the second booster or the fourth dose.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Next slide.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And yet again, in another study by Gazit, in almost 100,000 people at a different healthcare service, when you looked at the fourth dose and compared it to the third dose, there was an 86 percent vaccine effectiveness against severe disease.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Next slide.</p>



<p>Now, what we&#8217;re doing at the NIH &#8212; looking forward &#8212; about fourth doses that might be available for people in the longer range: We want to do better than just what we have.&nbsp; So there is now a new study that we just recently launched called COVAIL.&nbsp; And what we&#8217;ll be doing is assessing different fourth doses that are either ancestral strain or variant specific &#8212; in the first phase of the study.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the second phase of the study, we&#8217;re planning on looking at different vaccine platforms for the purpose of getting a great durability than we currently have.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Next slide. &nbsp;</p>



<p>And let me close by, again, just bringing to the attention of the audience: Covid.gov, where we can get one-stop shopping of all the information that you will need to help you navigate decisions about vaccines and about testings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With that, I&#8217;ll hand it over now to Secretary Becerra.</p>



<p>SECRETARY BECERRA:&nbsp; Thank you, Dr. Fauci.&nbsp; When it comes to COVID, we have more tools than ever before to stay safe, from vaccines and boosters, to treatments and tests.&nbsp; All widely available at no cost to the American people thanks to our national COVID response over the past year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But we also know that many people continue to feel the physical and the mental burden of this pandemic.&nbsp; We have to ensure that people with disabilities, older Americans, and people who are immunocompromised aren&#8217;t left behind, and that they continue to have the tools and resources that they need to stay safe.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just yesterday, we expanded coverage of free over-the-counter COVID tests to the tens of millions of Medicare beneficiaries.&nbsp; People with Medicare now have access each month to up to eight easy-to-use, at-home COVID-19 tests at no cost.&nbsp; This is all a part of our overall strategy to ensure access to tests free of charge.</p>



<p>In the past year, we have more than tripled the number of sites where people can get COVID-19 tests for free and delivered close to 250 million free at-home, rapid tests to Americans who have ordered them.</p>



<p>President Biden has been clear, we must ensure that no one is left behind as we work to move forward in the fight against COVID-19.&nbsp; That also means taking on big and complex physical and mental health challenges caused by COVID.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Americans of every age and background are experiencing Long COVID.&nbsp; Americans have experienced the loss of a loved one due to COVID, including over 200,000 children who&#8217;ve lost a parent or caregiver.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And Americans nationwide are grappling with mental health and substance-use challenges caused by or exacerbated by the pandemic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s be clear, we are going to use every tool we have to be there for these Americans.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve made significant investments in mental healthcare, as well as substance-use prevention, treatment, and recovery support.&nbsp; That is especially important for people dealing with COVID and COVID-related loss.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve launched efforts across the NIH, the CDC, and the Veterans Administration, including the landmark $1.1 billion recovery initiative, to better understand Long COVID and accelerate scientific progress.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And we are providing Americans experiencing Long COVID information about where they can access the resources and support they need, as well as helping them understand, if they have a disability, and educating them on their rights.</p>



<p>Long COVID is real, and there is still so much we don&#8217;t know about it.&nbsp; Millions of Americans may be struggling with lingering health effects, ranging from things that are easier to notice, like troubling &#8212; trouble breathing or irregular heartbeat, to less apparent but potentially serious conditions related to the brain or mental health.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the President&#8217;s direction, the Department of Health and Human Services will be leading a government-wide response to Long COVID focused on three main goals: improving care services and other support for individuals with Long COVID; enhancing education and outreach among the public-private sector and the medical community; and advancing research to support both goals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, of course, we&#8217;ll collaborate with academic, industry, and state and local partners to better understand Long COVID.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Through it all, we’ll continue to assess and highlight the long-term effects of COVID-19 on our hardest-hit and highest-risk communities, and make sure they receive the support they need.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To do this, we&#8217;re launching the first-ever interagency national research agenda on Long COVID &#8212; a National Research Action Plan.&nbsp;</p>



<p>HHS will lead a government-wide interagency coordinating council, which will involve experts from the Department of Defense, Veterans Administration, the Labor Department, and many entities across government to coordinate both public- and private-sector work to advance our understanding of Long COVID and to accelerate efforts to prevent, detect, and treat it.</p>



<p>In real time, we will share lessons on how to prevent, detect, and treat Long COVID.&nbsp; And this coordinated effort will help ensure our research is being directed toward the people who need care the most.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We continue to focus on improving care.&nbsp; If we receive additional financial support for it from Congress, we will launch new centers of excellence in communities across the country to provide high-quality care to individuals experiencing Long COVID and to get best practices out there to physicians across the country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We&#8217;re determined as a nation, as the President has said, to not leave anyone behind.&nbsp; And that includes our loved ones suffering from Long COVID and related conditions.&nbsp; We see you.&nbsp; We&#8217;re focused on you.&nbsp; And we are committed to advancing our nation&#8217;s capacity to understand and treat your conditions.</p>



<p>And I&#8217;ll end with this: We know the best way to prevent Long COVID is to prevent you from getting COVID in the first place.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so critical to get vaccinated and boosted, which is our best tools that we have to prevent COVID-19.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So I continue to encourage everyone eligible to get vaccinated and boosted to go do it so we can all move forward safely together.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>



<p>Back to you, Jeff.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Well, thanks, Secretary.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With that, Kevin, let&#8217;s open it up for some questions.&nbsp; Kevin?</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Thanks, Jeff.&nbsp; We only have time for a few questions today.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s go to Sabrina Siddiqui at Wall Street Journal.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, as always, for doing the briefing.&nbsp; I wanted to ask about COVID funding.&nbsp; Republicans are trying to insert an amendment into the COVID deal to reinstate Title 42.&nbsp; There are even some Democrats, such as Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, who have said that they&#8217;re open to considering such an amendment.&nbsp; Is the administration concerned that the decision to lift Title 42 could now threaten COVID funding?</p>



<p>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Thanks for the question.&nbsp; Look, Title 42 is a public health authority.&nbsp; And therefore, it&#8217;s always been a decision made by the scientists and public health experts at the CDC.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s based on the public health conditions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And it should remain independent of the urgently needed funding that we talked about today to sustain our COVID response here domestically and our global response.&nbsp; So this should not be included on any funding bill.&nbsp; The decision should be made by CDC, which it has been.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s where it belongs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Next question, please.</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Let’s go to Erin Billups at Spectrum News.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi.&nbsp; Thanks so much for taking my question.&nbsp; For Dr. Walensky and Secretary Becerra &#8212; just wondering, with this increased focus on Long COVID, if Type 2 diabetes is being considered a part of the Long COVID problem.&nbsp; There was a new study published in The Lancet last month that finds a link between COVID infections and an increased risk of being diagnosed with diabetes.&nbsp; And experts I&#8217;ve spoken to say there&#8217;s an urgent need to aggressively screen the U.S. population for diabetes and get more people into diabetes management programs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Are you looking for funding for that as well?&nbsp; Have there&#8217;s been any discussions about that?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Dr. Walensky, why don’t you go first here?&nbsp;</p>



<p>DR. WALENSKY:&nbsp; Yeah, thank you for that question.&nbsp; First, let me say we &#8212; the science is definitely starting to demonstrate this link between people who previously had COVID and increasing rates of new diabetes diagnoses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Certainly, public health infrastructure will assist in not only screening for diabetes, but also for nutrition and diabetes care.&nbsp; And I think as we consider the menu of many things that could incorporate &#8212; be incorporated into post-COVID conditions, diabetes certainly should be one of those conditions considered.</p>



<p>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Secretary Becerra?</p>



<p>SECRETARY BECERRA:&nbsp; And I’ll simply add, based on what Dr. Walensky has said and our scientists are telling us, we need to work as aggressively as we can to make sure that no American is left behind.&nbsp; So that means that if we need more funding to address Long COVID, we&#8217;re going to fight to get that from Congress because we understand that COVID is having effects long after the actual virus has escaped us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Next question, please.</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Go to Tamara Keith at NPR.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you for taking my question.&nbsp; By my very rudimentary math, you&#8217;re getting about 60 percent of the money that you asked for, for domestic COVID programs.&nbsp; So what takes the hit?&nbsp; How &#8212; what do you do with only 60 percent of the money?</p>



<p>Additionally, is there any thought of changing the requirements of testing for international travel and masks on planes?&nbsp; If we could get an update on that.</p>



<p>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Okay, on your second question: No, there are no plans to change the international travel requirements at this point.</p>



<p>We asked &#8212; your math is good math here.&nbsp; We asked for $22.5 billion, and Congress is working to pass $10 billion &#8212; only a fraction of the immediate need.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And that immediate need is immediate.&nbsp; It&#8217;s for vaccines, therapeutics, and tests.&nbsp; The $10 billion for domestic efforts funds some of these urgent needs, but we still need additional funding for both our domestic effort and our global efforts where there&#8217;s no additional funding in the $10 billion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, every dollar we requested is critical to both our domestic and global response.&nbsp; HHS, under the Secretary, will work through how to best deploy these very limited resources to satisfy the most urgent of the urgent needs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, yes, we need Congress to pass the $10 billion and then get immediately back to work to get more money for domestic and get money for our global response.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Next question, please.</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Let&#8217;s go to Zeke Miller at the AP.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; Two questions.&nbsp; First, with the lack of the COVID funding for international vaccine sharing, what impact will that have on the U.S. capacity to (inaudible) the number of doses and meet its international commitments through the end of the year?</p>



<p>And then, for the doctors, do you have any update on plans and timeline for pediatric vaccines for kids under five?&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; So I&#8217;ll go first.&nbsp; On the &#8212; on the globe &#8212; on then impact on not having any funding &#8212; additional funding at this point for the global response.&nbsp; Look, the lack of global funding has real implications on our efforts to vaccinate the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Without the additional global funding, USAID does not have the resources it needs to help countries get more shots in arms.&nbsp; We&#8217;ll be forced to scale back the work that we do to provide oxygen and other lifesaving supplies to countries that need them.&nbsp; Our global genomic sequencing capabilities will fall off, and that undermines our ability to detect emerging variants beyond our borders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And speaking of borders, as I&#8217;ve said, you know, the virus knows no borders, and it&#8217;s in our national interest to vaccinate the world and protect against any possible future variants.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So it&#8217;s a real disappointment to not have any global funding in this bill.&nbsp; It has real implications.&nbsp; We need funding as quickly as possible. Congress needs to act with urgency to fund our global response so that we can accelerate our efforts to turn vaccines &#8212; we do have vaccine supply &#8212; we need to turn those vaccines into vaccinations around the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. Fauci.</p>



<p>DR. FAUCI:&nbsp; Yeah, with regard to the vaccines for children, I believe you&#8217;re referring to where are we with the six months to five-year vaccine approval or emergency use authorization.</p>



<p>As you well know, two companies have submitted or are submitting data to the FDA regarding children of various ages, including within that cohort of six months up to five years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The data are being analyzed right now.&nbsp; And I &#8212; we&#8217;re very sensitive to the fact that many parents out there are waiting for a decision on this.&nbsp; And the message we have to them is that we want to make sure that when you&#8217;re dealing with vaccines for anyone, particularly for children, that we get the data, we look at the data &#8212; and when I say “we,” I&#8217;m talking first the FDA for the authorization and then the CDC for the recommendation &#8212; so that we know that they&#8217;re safe.&nbsp; And thus far, there has to be &#8212; appears to be no safety signal whatsoever that would get anyone worried.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And the question is: What &#8212; what is the right dose and the dose regimen?&nbsp; And that would likely be different for the two companies that are now involved in putting their data in.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So we ask people to please be patient, because when a decision is be made, you can be sure that it’s a decision based on the good science that&#8217;s being collected and analyzed by the agencies involved.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thank you.</p>



<p>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Kevin.&nbsp; Next question.</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; A couple more questions.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s go to Sharon LaFraniere at New York Times.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you very much.&nbsp; This is a question for Dr. Walensky, please.&nbsp; So last week, you said that the option of a second booster was especially important for those 65 and up and 50 and up with underlying medical conditions.&nbsp; So does that &#8212; does “especially important” mean that you recommend it or you encourage it for those population groups, and you do not recommend it or encourage it for, say, healthy people 50 to 65?&nbsp;</p>



<p>And if &#8212; if it doesn&#8217;t mean that, can you give people some clearer sense of how they should decide whether to get the second booster since many people don&#8217;t have doctors to consult with?</p>



<p>DR. WALENSKY:&nbsp; Yeah, thank you for that question.&nbsp; So we have made the fourth shot &#8212; the second booster &#8212; available to everyone over the age of 50 because everybody does have individual, you know, risk assessment as to how they&#8217;re approaching this vaccine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But we really would encourage people who are over 50 who have underlying medical conditions, those over the age of 65, to go ahead and get that next shot.&nbsp; And also, to recognize that they may very well need another shot come the fall, and that will be the subject of an FDA meeting discussion tomorrow.</p>



<p>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Kevin, last question.</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Let&#8217;s go to Josh Wingrove at Bloomberg.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you very much.&nbsp; Can you talk a little bit more about the announcement on the pediatric vaccines?&nbsp; Are you able to provide a number?&nbsp;</p>



<p>And is the fact that they&#8217;re essentially sort of subbing in for adult vaccines is &#8212; we&#8217;ve seen Jen Psaki speak to this, but also COVAX &#8212; that demand is waning in developing countries for the adult vaccines.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Is that the reason why you&#8217;re essentially swapping?&nbsp; Or is it more a case of you wanting to hold back a little bit more adult vaccine just in case we need, more widely, fourth shots in the U.S. and just in case Congress doesn&#8217;t deliver more funding?&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Yeah. &nbsp;So, Josh, good questions.&nbsp; I mean, these donations are part of the billion Pfizer doses that we previously secured.&nbsp; So this is international supply.&nbsp; This has nothing to do with our domestic supply, where we do have enough vaccine supply for the booster doses &#8212; the fourth doses that Dr. Fauci and Dr. Walensky just talked about that have been recently authorized both for immunocompromised people and for people over 50.</p>



<p>On the domestic front, we do not have sufficient supply if the science dictates that all Americans get boosted sometime later in the year or if we were to need a vaccine-specific variant &#8212; I&#8217;m sorry, I&#8217;m sorry, a variant-specific vaccine &#8212; a different formulation than what we have today.&nbsp; We do not have the funding for that.</p>



<p>So on the pediatric international, there are plenty of doses available for adults, which gives us the opportunity to provide 100 million or more doses of Pfizer&#8217;s vaccine for 5-to-11-year-olds to donate in the upcoming months.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As I mentioned, 20 countries have already asked, including Pakistan and Vietnam &#8212; have made requests to vaccinate their children and to get vaccines to do so.&nbsp; None of this will undermine the position that we have right now, which is that we have plenty of supply in the U.S. to send abroad and other countries around the world to do the same to make sure that we have plenty of vaccines for adults across the world.</p>



<p>So we are now able to help lead the world in vaccinating both adults and children in those countries that are in need.</p>



<p>So before we close, this is likely my last briefing.&nbsp; I just want to say it&#8217;s been the honor of a lifetime to serve in this role.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As we enter this new moment in the pandemic, I can&#8217;t think of a better person to hand the baton to than Dr. Jha.&nbsp; I want to thank the Secretary, Dr. Fauci, Dr. Walensky for your partnership and continued leadership.&nbsp; And I want to thank the COVID-19 Response Team here at the White House, everyone inside and outside of government who has worked together tirelessly in our fight against the virus.</p>



<p>And finally, and importantly, to the members of the press: As always, thank you for joining these briefings, asking the questions you ask.&nbsp; And most importantly, thank you for all the important, critical work you do to provide information to the public.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So bottom line, thank you.</p>
