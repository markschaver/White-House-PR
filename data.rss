<p>The United States strongly condemns the attack on the United Nations compound in Herat, Afghanistan that resulted in the death of an Afghan guard. The United Nations in Afghanistan is a civilian entity focused on supporting peace efforts, promoting the rights of all Afghans and providing humanitarian and development assistance. Attacks against civilian UN personnel and facilities are prohibited under international law.<br><br>We reiterate our call for an immediate reduction in violence in Afghanistan, and for all regional actors to encourage the parties to return to negotiations without delay so that the Afghan people can achieve a durable and just political settlement that brings the peace and security they deserve.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Via Teleconference<br>South Court Auditorium</p>



<p>&nbsp;<br>12:03 P.M. EDT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Jay, you’re beginning to convince the American people there is a thing called “climate crisis.”&nbsp; About time.&nbsp; (Laughs.)<br>&nbsp;<br>GOVERNOR INSLEE:&nbsp; Indeed.<br>&nbsp;<br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Well, thank you all for being here.&nbsp; I’m going to make a brief statement here and then we’ll get to ask the Vice President to say a few words, get to some questions, and we’ll get down to business, if that’s okay with you all.<br>&nbsp;<br>You know, one month ago, we convened the first of what will be a regular presidential briefing on wildfire preparedness.&nbsp; And we’re joined by many of the governors who &#8212; we were joined by many of the governors who are with us today, as well as experts from across the administration and leaders from the electric utility sector.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>I said then that the threat of Western wildfires this year was as severe as it’s ever been.&nbsp; And in the past month, we’ve sadly seen the truth of that being played out.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Since our &#8212; our last meeting, the number of large, uncontained wildfires has nearly doubled to 66 &#8212; 66 of those fires.&nbsp; And the number of firefighters on the job to battle them has tripled.&nbsp; Over 3.4 million acres have already burned.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>In Oregon, the Bootleg Fire has destroyed more than 400 structures, including more than 160 homes.&nbsp; In California, the Dixie Fire has grown to over 220,000 acres and our firefighters are working in really rugged and dangerous conditions and terrain.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The number of states are experiencing the impacts of smoke from these fires, degrading their air quality, not just where the fires are burning, but all the states moving east &#8212; not all, but most.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>In short, we’ve got big, complex wildfires burning across multiple areas.&nbsp; And despite the incredible &#8212; and I’m not &#8212; this is not being solicitous &#8212; the incredible bravery and heroism of our firefighters, our resources are already being stretched to keep up.&nbsp; We need more help, particularly when we also factor in the additional nationwide challenges of pandemic-related supply chain disruptions and our ongoing efforts to fight COVID.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>We’ve had a few COVID clusters at our fire camps, which further limits resources.&nbsp; It’s just one more reason why it’s so darn important that everyone get vaccinated, I might add.<br>&nbsp;<br>Sadly, we’ve also lost two brave firefighters in the last month in a plane crash in Arizona, and five were seriously injured last week battling the Devil’s Creek fire in Montana.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>It’s &#8212; to state the obvious, and you governors know it better than anybody &#8212; it is really, really dangerous work, and it takes incredible bravery to do it.&nbsp; And these heroes deserve to be paid &#8212; and paid well &#8212; for their work.&nbsp; That’s why, last month, I was able to announce &#8212; and it’s not paying that well, in my view, to be honest with you &#8212; immediate action to make all federal firefighters making at least $15 an hour.&nbsp; I think they deserve more than that.<br>&nbsp;<br>We’re also working with Congress to make sure that our firefighters are paid better permanently.&nbsp; Permanently.&nbsp; So far, FEMA has approved 20 Fire Management Assistance Grants totaling up to $100 million to help states pay for the cost of fighting these fires.<br>&nbsp;<br>We’re also working with FEMA and the Defense Logistical Agency to get ahead of this emergency supply chain challenges.&nbsp; And we still have some supply chain challenges relating to hoses and a number of other things.<br>&nbsp;<br>We’re trapped &#8212; we’ve tapped additional aircraft from the Department of Defense to aid in the fire detection and firefighting.&nbsp; We also welcome the support of our allies, from Australia, for example, sending a large air tanker to which it’s going to begin flying missions this week.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And last month, I also noted that the EPA would be launching an upgrade app for mobile phones to easily share location-specific information with the public about the effects of fire and smoke on air quality for them.&nbsp; It’s now even more important, because smoke from many of these fires burning in the West and along the Canadian border is affecting air quality in states across the country.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>As of today, the upgrade app &#8212; the upgrade AirNow app is live and ready for use.&nbsp; Folks in affected areas should download this important tool as quickly as possible.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>I also encourage our states and county leaders to continue partnering with FEMA, as many of the leaders on the scene today are leveraging our Public Alert and Warning systems to communicate information directly and quickly about &#8212; to the public about wildfires, evacuations, power outages, and more.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>I know several of the governors’ states have used this system recently and send &#8212; to send warnings of evacuation orders, and it has undoubtedly helped people and, we don’t know for certain, but likely saved some lives.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>But we’re in for a long fight yet this year, and the only way we’re going to meet those challenges is by working together.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Wildfires are a problem for all of us and we have to stay closely coordinated in doing everything we can for our people.&nbsp; That’s why I asked the governors to join us &#8212; Democrats and Republicans alike &#8212; so they can update me and the Vice President directly on what they need and what we can possibly do more of.&nbsp; And so we can discuss what’s needed today &#8212; we have to meet an urgent danger at hand &#8212; a plan for what we can do to make sure we’re better prepared next time.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>One of the important aspects of the &#8212; of the bipartisan infrastructure deal that is before the Senate now is it includes billions of dollars &#8212; billions of dollars &#8212; to strengthen wildfire preparedness, resilience, and response.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>It includes funding for prevention efforts, like forest management, and to restore millions of acres of high-risk areas to protect homes and public water sources for drinking.&nbsp; And &#8212; you know, and overlaying all of this is the necessity to successfully confront climate change.<br>&nbsp;<br>We may &#8212; we have some significant changes we’re making in these two pieces of legislation that, God willing, will pass in the next month or so.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>But we can’t ignore how the overlapping and intertwined factors of extreme heat, prolonged drought, and supercharged wildfire conditions are affecting the country.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And so, this is a challenge that demands our urgent, urgent action, both today and, as you all know better than anyone else in the country, not just today, but tomorrow, next year, and the year after.<br>&nbsp;<br>And so, I want to thank you, Governors, for your leadership during what is an incredibly challenging period for all of you.&nbsp; God, love you.&nbsp; You&#8217;re going through &#8212; anyway.&nbsp; It&#8217;s &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>And I’d like to ask, now, the Vice President to make a few comments.&nbsp; And then, I have some questions for all and we get in a discussion, with your permission.&nbsp; Thank you.<br>&nbsp;<br>Vice President.<br>&nbsp;<br>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Thank you, Mr. President.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>We stand with you.&nbsp; We stand with you, and this is a commitment from our administration that we will not only stand with you, but stay in touch with you, mostly to hear from you.&nbsp; We know that the way that we can help you manage and expand your capacity is through the partnership that we have &#8212; the federal and state government, along with local governments.<br>&nbsp;<br>This &#8212; this issue is ongoing.&nbsp; Each year, as we have discussed, it gets worse.&nbsp; It affects real people &#8212; everything from children who are breathing the smoke to parents who are up at night, concerned that they may get an evacuation order at any &#8212; at any moment.&nbsp; So, know that we are here to maximize the federal capacity to support the states.<br>&nbsp;<br>I&#8217;m in D.C., but, of course, I&#8217;m a California girl and I care deeply about this.&nbsp; We &#8212; as I think I&#8217;ve shared with many of you, our family has been under evacuation orders in the last couple of years.&nbsp; And &#8212; and our folks should not have to fear that they are &#8212; they are going to lose their home, everything they have, much less risk their lives in these moments.<br>&nbsp;<br>So, thank you all for your courage, for your leadership, and I look forward to staying in touch with you.<br>&nbsp;<br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Thank you.<br>&nbsp;<br>Folks, I asked the staff &#8212; because I think it&#8217;s &#8212; I&#8217;ve had the great honor of being, over the last 15 years, in your states and in the wilderness areas and the national parks.&nbsp; And I asked my staff to put together maps where exactly where the fires are and the areas they&#8217;re in and what they&#8217;re affecting.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And so, I want to start off with you, Governor Gianforte, up in Montana.&nbsp; You have your hands full, man.&nbsp; And I &#8212; looking at &#8212; at the map, all away from, you know, Poverty Flats and Crooked Creek, all the way up into Ruby and Hay Creek, and the other end of the state.&nbsp; But the big fires look like they&#8217;re in Trail Creek and Alder Creek &#8212; in those areas that are significant.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And I got &#8212; I have a simple question, and it&#8217;s a complicated one, but what can we do for you that &#8212; that we&#8217;re just not getting done now?&nbsp; What additional help can we give you now that &#8212; that is not &#8212; not there yet?<br>&nbsp;<br>I mean, cut through all the &#8212; all the jargon about, you know, all that we policy wonks are talking about various programs.&nbsp; Bottom line: What do you need and can we help &#8212; you know, that we haven&#8217;t?<br>&nbsp;<br>GOVERNOR GIANFORTE:&nbsp; Good morning, Mr. President, Madam Vice President.&nbsp; I want to thank you for the opportunity to join you, and I want to answer your question because there are some things we can do to collaborate and work closer together.<br>&nbsp;<br>Just to give a moment of background: As we meet this morning, our heroic firefighters are confronting 19 largescale fires in Montana alone.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And to put that in perspective: Just since January 1st, we&#8217;ve had 1,600 fires start in Montana and we&#8217;ve burned about 220,000 acres.&nbsp; These wildfires threaten the safety of our communities.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>That Poverty Flats fire that you mentioned, in the last week, burned from initial start to 65,000 acres currently threatening 1,200 households out in the Big Horn County area, our first responders.&nbsp; These devastate our local communities and the costs keep mounting.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve spent &#8212; the state has spent $13 million since July 1st alone.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>It could have been much worse.&nbsp; And this gets to your question, Mr. President.&nbsp; Without our state&#8217;s commitment &#8212; and we&#8217;ve shared this with Forest Service and BLM, and they&#8217;ve been very cooperative &#8212; to aggressive initial attack, Montana &#8212; without that commitment, we would have had many more largescale fires.&nbsp; And we ask that our federal partners join us in applying this operating principle.&nbsp; Whether it&#8217;s a fire that starts on private, state, or federal land &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Yeah.<br>&nbsp;<br>GOVERNOR GIANFORTE: &#8212; fires are easier to manage when they&#8217;re smaller.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Mm-hmm.<br>&nbsp;<br>GOVERNOR GIANFORTE:&nbsp; And when we get after them, we do much better.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>As we continue to confront this wildfire season, we&#8217;re also focused on addressing Montana&#8217;s forest health crisis.&nbsp; We published, earlier this year, the Montana Forest Action Plan, which identifies 9 million acres of forest land with significant forest health issues and an elevated risk of wildfire.&nbsp; Of those acres at risk, we found about 4 million acres that would benefit most from cross-bounty [sic] &#8212; boundary forest management.<br>&nbsp;<br>Given the need to actively manage our forests, I&#8217;ve charged our Department of Natural Resources and Conservation to double the number of acres it treats with active forest management this year at 25,000 acres.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>But this is just a starting point.&nbsp; We&#8217;ll actively manage private, state, and federal land with a variety of treatment types, including thinning, logging, and prescribed burn.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>We&#8217;ve also invested in 14 different cross-boundary projects in Montana this year.&nbsp; These projects demonstrate the importance of working together across ownership &#8212; ownership boundaries to create meaningful, landscape-scale change.&nbsp; And using funds from the state&#8217;s fire suppression account and the Forest Service State and Private Forestry Division, we&#8217;ll expand existing work and jumpstart new activities.<br>&nbsp;<br>But it&#8217;s not up, totally, to us.&nbsp; We ask that our federal partners join us in doing what needs to be done year-round to reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfires.<br>&nbsp;<br>Of the 9 million acres at high risk, 60 percent of those are on federal land.&nbsp; This makes tools like the Good Neighbor Authority and stewardship contracting more important than ever.<br>&nbsp;<br>The benefits are really clear: We have healthier forests, improved wildlife habitats, more recreational opportunities, and more good-paying jobs, and, most importantly, less severe wildfires.&nbsp; Without active forest management, we can&#8217;t be successful in our forest health improvements.<br>&nbsp;<br>In closing, I just want to say &#8212; I want to thank our federal partners.&nbsp; We have good collaborative relationships here in Montana with the Forest Service and BLM.&nbsp; I also want to thank Governor Newsom and Governor Cox for sending crews to help us deal with these fires that are currently burning.&nbsp; We have thousands of first responders on the frontlines, right now, protecting our communities, natural resources, and livelihoods across Montana, across the western United States.<br>&nbsp;<br>So many people have sacrificed, and I can&#8217;t thank them enough.&nbsp; We can&#8217;t measure it in dollars spent or acres burns &#8212; burned.&nbsp; We have to keep them and their loved ones in our thoughts and our prayers.<br>&nbsp;<br>I agree with you, Mr. President.&nbsp; Now is the time to act.&nbsp; I think it&#8217;s all about aggressive initial attack and getting more proactive in our forest management.<br>&nbsp;<br>Again, Mr. President, Vice President Harris, I want to thank you for letting me join you today.<br>&nbsp;<br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Greg, let me ask you another question, if I may.&nbsp; There&#8217;s press in the room, and lots of times, I know I do and we all do, use terms which those of us who are in public office &#8212; whether it&#8217;s President, Senator, Governor, et cetera &#8212; use, and I don&#8217;t think &#8212; understandably, the American people don&#8217;t fully understand what they mean.&nbsp; And &#8212; and even I &#8212; sometimes the press has so much to cover, I&#8217;m not sure they &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>You talked about the Forest Health Plan.&nbsp; And talk about, as I say to my staff all the time, in plain English, what’s that mean.&nbsp; Explain a little bit what that means.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>GOVERNOR GIANFORTE:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; So, we have many forests in Montana that have not had good stewardship.&nbsp; The growth has gotten to the point &#8212; I can take you 10 miles west to the state capital in Helena and show you a federal forest where 90 percent of the trees are standing dead.&nbsp; They&#8217;ve been killed by beetle when &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>THE PRESIDENT: &nbsp;Right.&nbsp; Right.<br>&nbsp;<br>GOVERNOR GIANFORTE:&nbsp; And this really creates a tinderbox situation.&nbsp; It reduces habitat.&nbsp; So. very &#8212; very little wildlife lives there.&nbsp; And when we get a lightning strike or a campfire out of control and a fire starts in a forest like that, we put firefighters at risk.&nbsp; They&#8217;re very hard to control.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The state has been very proactive.&nbsp; We &#8212; the state has about 5 million acres.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve been very active in being stewards of those grounds.&nbsp; And when we thin a forest &#8212; this is not clear cuts &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Right.<br>&nbsp;<br>GOVERNOR GIANFORTE:&nbsp; &#8212; but when we thin, when we remove excess fuels, water comes back into surface streams, wildlife comes back into that community.&nbsp; And when wildfire goes through a managed forest, it doesn’t then get into the crown.&nbsp; It doesn&#8217;t burn as hot.&nbsp; We don&#8217;t have the devastation.&nbsp; And structures aren&#8217;t threatened.&nbsp; So everybody wins when we have good stewardship of the forest.<br>&nbsp;<br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; That&#8217;s really important.&nbsp; I &#8212; believe it or not, I knew that.&nbsp; But that’s really important for people to get it.&nbsp; Because we talk about thinning out the forest.&nbsp; We&#8217;re talking about a lot of trees, because of climate change as well, where you have bugs, insects, eating up the trees as well, making things that &#8212; that are changing and killing the forest themselves, and they become real tinder.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s like, you know, dropping a match in a &#8212; you know, in &#8212; almost like in a pool of fuel.<br>&nbsp;<br>And so going in and cutting all that out is not the same as going in &#8212; I&#8217;m glad you made the point of clear cutting &#8212; going in and just &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>So I &#8212; look, we do have, and we&#8217;re &#8212; I&#8217;m hopeful that we&#8217;re going to get a lot of the infrastructure plan passed and the Recovery Act that has a lot of money in here to help you all manage these forests and to have much more money in there for the &#8212; for the Bureau of Land Management &#8212; anyway &#8212; to be able to give you the help you need.&nbsp; Because your state, which I&#8217;ve been through, is a magnificently beautiful state.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>It&#8217;s &#8212; and, I mean &#8212; and the thing &#8212; you know, you &#8212; I come from the state of Delaware.&nbsp; And, you know, you had &#8212; we had more acreage burned last year than the state of Delaware and Maryland combined &#8212; combined.&nbsp; For you all out in Montana, that ain’t (inaudible).&nbsp; (Laughs.)&nbsp; But I want people to get a sense of how massive &#8212; how massive these fires are and how they affect water systems and &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>Anyway, but that&#8217;s &#8212; I&#8217;m sorry to take your time, but I wanted you to be able to explain that so people understand that are listening to this.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Let me ask you &#8212; let me ask you, Governor Inslee: You know, you&#8217;ve been talking about the impacts of environmental change for a long, long time.&nbsp; And one of the things &#8212; and I asked him to show me &#8212; to get me a map of where all your fires are in your state.&nbsp; And when you have Delancy and Cub Creek 2 and Cedar Creek &#8212; I mean, they&#8217;re massive fires.&nbsp; Massive.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And what are &#8212; you know, as you look at what&#8217;s transpired over the past month and you look at the road ahead of this wildfire scene, what is your biggest concern, Jay?&nbsp; What is your biggest concern?&nbsp; And again, I ask you the same question: What is the thing we can do most?&nbsp; I mean, you go all the way from Delancy down to “Lil’ Crick,” as they say &#8212; in the Creek &#8212; you know down in the southwest &#8212; southeast part of your state.&nbsp; What are &#8212; what are your biggest concerns?<br>&nbsp;<br>GOVERNOR INSLEE:&nbsp; Well, first off, thanks for your leadership, Mr. President.&nbsp; It is so refreshing to have a President who really cares about the Western Forest.<br>&nbsp;<br>My biggest concern might surprise you because all of the governors share these immediate concerns.&nbsp; We have a huge need for additional aerial assets, additional dozer bosses so we can get our dozers into fire lines.&nbsp; We need new tra- &#8212; more trained people.&nbsp; We do have an emerging concern about our fuel supply for our aerial assets.&nbsp; Everything we need to fight forest fires is in dire need across the Western United States, not just in Washington State.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve had a thousand fires.&nbsp; It&#8217;s burned four times more at this time of year than normal.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve had two and a half times more acreage burn in the last decade than the previous.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So those are the obvious concerns.&nbsp; And everything you need to fight a fire, we &#8212; we could use your help on.&nbsp; And I think you&#8217;ve been totally on top of this, and so I thank you for your leadership on all of these things, including management issues.&nbsp; There&#8217;s unanimity, there&#8217;s bipartisan acceptance of the need for active management.&nbsp; We&#8217;re acti- &#8212; we&#8217;re managing our forests, just like Montana is, to try to get in and reduce fuel.<br>&nbsp;<br>But here&#8217;s the surprising thing, when you asked me this question, or the thing that I worry most about: The thing I worry most about is if, for some reason, the Congress did not follow your leadership in this reconciliation and infrastructure bills that allowed you to realize your vision of creating millions of jobs while fighting climate change.&nbsp; That&#8217;s my biggest worry right now.&nbsp; Because the fact of the matter is there is nothing in human intervention against these fires while climate continues to ravage our forest.<br>&nbsp;<br>You know, we used to think of these things are forests.&nbsp; They really, now, just fields of fuel, and they&#8217;re fields of fire with just one spark because they&#8217;re so dry.&nbsp; And that aridity creates something like gasoline on the floor of our forest.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>There is only one way to prevent these forests from being gone in the la- &#8212; in the next century effectively, to be totally unrecognizable, and that is to succeed in following your vision in the reconciliation bill for a clean energy standard, for a huge transition to the electrification of our transportation fleet, to a civilian climate corps.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And so, I want to tell you we are going to be with you, as you stand tall, while you negotiate this reconciliation bill to say, “Look, we have to have those climate investments.&nbsp; There is only one way to save these forests from the ravages of climate.”&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Our own federal scientists have said that if we accept a one-degree centigrade change, we&#8217;ll have 600 percent increase in these fires on a regular basis.&nbsp; We won&#8217;t recognize these forests as forests anymore unless we succeed with your vision.<br>&nbsp;<br>So when you start having those discussions with Mr. Klain and Steve Ricchetti and everyone else at the end of the reconciliation process, you got to know you&#8217;re going to have an army behind you standing tall for those things.<br>&nbsp;<br>Now, there&#8217;s some other small things that I&#8217;m talking to your staff about, about having better independent assistance for towns like Malden that burned down.&nbsp; There&#8217;s some other coordination.<br>&nbsp;<br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Yeah.<br>&nbsp;<br>GOVERNOR INSLEE:&nbsp; But that&#8217;s the thing that&#8217;s going to ultimately decide whether these forests survive in the next century.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Thanks for your leadership, Mr. President.<br>&nbsp;<br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Well, thank you for saying that.&nbsp; But, you know, one of the things that I say to all your colleagues: When I &#8212; when it was proposed to me by some folks that we should have a Civilian Climate Corps of thousands of young people trained to do these things and &#8212; at first, it didn&#8217;t &#8212; you know, I said, &#8220;Yeah, yeah, that sounds good.&#8221;&nbsp; And then I started looking at it.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And the truth of it is, it&#8217;s not fundamentally different, in terms of the help it can provide across the board training a lot of these &#8212; I&#8217;m talking about thousands of young people getting paid to be trained and trained well for a very &#8212; it&#8217;s not &#8212; it&#8217;s not fundamentally different than the Civilian Corps put together in the Depression that was &#8212; had a different purpose.&nbsp; They were building a building.&nbsp; They were doing a whole range of things.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>But I just think I&#8217;d encourage &#8212; and also, we&#8217;ll send it to all of you.&nbsp; But all you governors &#8212; Democrat, Republican &#8212; take a look at it and see if you think I&#8217;m &#8212; you know, I may have &#8212; you know, as my mother would say, my eyes are bigger than my stomach.&nbsp; You know that I may have a bigger appetite.<br>&nbsp;<br>But I &#8212; I really think it can &#8212; can be helpful.&nbsp; And there &#8212; again, I say to your colleagues, there&#8217;s a lot of money in here to be able to deal with your immediate needs as well.<br>&nbsp;<br>But, anyway.&nbsp; Thanks, Jay.&nbsp; And I&#8217;ll get &#8212; I know you have this, but I want to get &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>GOVERNOR INSLEE:&nbsp; Thank you.<br>&nbsp;<br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; &#8212; more of it to you.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And, Gavin, I &#8212; or, Governor, you know, I applaud your your &#8212; your establishing the Wildfire and Forest Resilience Task Force, which I&#8217;ve learned is co-chaired by your Secretary of Natural Resources. &nbsp;I think it&#8217;s a great example of being able to coordinate federal, state, local because this is getting real &#8212; this is &#8212; this is getting &#8212; this is &#8212; this needs a lot of coordination.<br>&nbsp;<br>And I understand that PG&amp;E, which provides electric to 17 million of your folks &#8212; I understand they recently announced underground 10,000 miles of power lines.&nbsp; Is that &#8212; is that true?&nbsp; And what&#8217;s that going to do to the cost of energy in your state?&nbsp; And &#8212; I mean, because that&#8217;s expensive stuff.<br>&nbsp;<br>GOVERNOR NEWSOM:&nbsp; It&#8217;s a million to three and a half million dollars a mile to &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Yeah.<br>&nbsp;<br>GOVERNOR NEWSOM:&nbsp; &#8212; underground in California.&nbsp; Do the math on 10,000 miles.<br>&nbsp;<br>Of course, do the math on decades of neglect.&nbsp; Ten thousand miles is a drop in the bucket.&nbsp; They have 106,000 miles of distribution line.&nbsp; Twenty-five thousand just in high-risk, fire-prone areas which will only grow.&nbsp; That&#8217;s a 10-year commitment.&nbsp; It&#8217;s important, but I want to put it in perspective.<br>&nbsp;<br>I also want to put something else in perspective.&nbsp; Your eyes, Mr. President, are not wider than your stomach.&nbsp; California is proving your theory.&nbsp; Over a year and a half ago we established the Climate Corps in this state.&nbsp; It&#8217;s inspiring beyond words.&nbsp; It&#8217;s also inspired the philanthropic sector &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; It really is, isn&#8217;t it?&nbsp; I mean, it&#8217;s not a joke.&nbsp; It is inspiring when you see it.&nbsp; I mean, it&#8217;s incredible, I think.&nbsp; But &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>GOVERNOR NEWSOM:&nbsp; Absolutely.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s the one thing this country needs more than anything else, and that&#8217;s common experiences and to focus on the things that bind us together, not just divide us.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>This transcends politics.&nbsp; We have kids from urban and rural parts of the state, across every conceivable difference, and they&#8217;re advancing together in ways that truly are awe-inspiring.<br>&nbsp;<br>So, Mr. President, that&#8217;s &#8212; that&#8217;s a vision we can manifest.&nbsp; We&#8217;re not asserting it; we&#8217;re proving it.<br>&nbsp;<br>In a small way, you have the opportunity to do it in &#8212; at scale.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Look, I just want to briefly &#8212; because there&#8217;s so many of us &#8212; a quick update.&nbsp; We&#8217;re blowing past every record, and not in a good way.&nbsp; We&#8217;re at over 5,700 fires year-to-date.&nbsp; We suppressed 59 just yesterday with some initial attacks.&nbsp; Over half a million acres already burned in California.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>To put in perspective &#8212; a record-breaking year.&nbsp; Last year, we were at 130,000 acres burned.&nbsp; We&#8217;re at 504,000 as I speak to you today.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Here&#8217;s the answer to your question.&nbsp; And forgive me for being so pointed again, respecting your time, but I want to be a little bit more specific.<br>&nbsp;<br>Jay referenced it obliquely.&nbsp; Please pay attention to this fuels issue.&nbsp; We had to get our National Guard to get some emergency fuel supplies for our aerial fleet a week ago.&nbsp; This is a major issue, and it&#8217;s not just impacting our aerial suppression strategies on the West Coast.&nbsp; It&#8217;s increasingly, as you may know, impacting commercial aviation.&nbsp; It is a major issue.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Number two, we just simply need more boots on the ground.&nbsp; We can&#8217;t do without you.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve got 7,400 people &#8212; 7,400 already.&nbsp; We&#8217;re not in fire season.&nbsp; Fire season in California is late September, October, into November.&nbsp; We&#8217;re in July.&nbsp; We already have 7,400 personnel actively working to suppress fires.<br>&nbsp;<br>Last year, the federal government asked us for over 5,000 mutual aid support that we could not provide.&nbsp; That gives you a sense of what the federal government wanted from California last year to send to other states.&nbsp; That should give you a sense of how far behind we are with federal support.<br>&nbsp;<br>We have four DC-10s, Mr. President.&nbsp; Four.&nbsp; Now, DC-10s aren&#8217;t the answer to every problem.&nbsp; They don&#8217;t fly over 35 knots.&nbsp; They have restrictions; there are legendary restrictions.&nbsp; But the reality is there is four for the country, and we&#8217;re competing.&nbsp; They&#8217;re all contracted.&nbsp; We compete with you.&nbsp; We compete with other states.&nbsp; We don&#8217;t even have access right now to DC-10s.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>We lost that 747 &#8212; that iconic 747 &#8212; that now has been converted to a cargo plane.&nbsp; You&#8217;ve seen that in Australia, not just across the West Coast.&nbsp; That&#8217;s now been grounded by a private contractor.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>We are the largest civil aviation fleet for firefighting in the world &#8212; California.&nbsp; We do not come close to having the tools in the air that we need.&nbsp; We need your support to su- &#8212; to dramatically increase the aerial support, in addition to boots on the ground.<br>&nbsp;<br>Final two quick points: Every year, we&#8217;re competing &#8212; and you have a lot of legislators that have been doing heroic work in Democratic states, governors &#8212; and Republican states &#8212; trying to get access to the Pentagon satellite technology for early detection.&nbsp; It&#8217;s been a game changer for us.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re getting it on a year-to-year basis, but it&#8217;s hard.&nbsp; Every year, we fight to get a one-year extension on that access to a critical tool of technology.<br>&nbsp;<br>I&#8217;d encourage you to help us so we&#8217;re not just fighting every year for something that I think you would support and the Pentagon, at the end of the day, final analysis will approve.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>But here&#8217;s the final thing, and it&#8217;s the elephant in the room.&nbsp; I was with Governor Sisolak two days ago in his state of Nevada.&nbsp; The reason why is we had a fire that was on federal property.&nbsp; Fifty-seven percent of the forest property in California is federal, just three percent under California jurisdiction.&nbsp; Three percent.&nbsp; Fifty-seven percent under U.S. Forest Service.&nbsp; U.S. Forest Service is spectacular.&nbsp; We have deep admiration and respect, but there&#8217;s a culture that, too often, is, &#8220;Wait and see.&#8221;&nbsp; We can&#8217;t afford that any longer.&nbsp; This was a federal fire.&nbsp; They waited.&nbsp; And what we saw is the fire took off because we didn&#8217;t put enough initial assets.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Greg was making an oblique point here.&nbsp; I want to be a little bit more explicit: We need your help to change the culture, in terms of the suppression strategies, in this climate, literally and figuratively, to be more aggressive on these federal fires.<br>&nbsp;<br>That fire bled into Nevada and, obviously, impacted not just our two states, but deeply impacted the redundancy of this concern that comes out every year around jurisdictions and incident command and the imperative that we&#8217;re all on the same page, in terms of those initial attack strategies.<br>&nbsp;<br>So, forgive me for being longwinded, but I wanted to get those clear &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; No, no that&#8217;s &#8212; that&#8217;s why we&#8217;re doing this.&nbsp; I want to find out what &#8212; what&#8217;s the greatest concerns you have.<br>&nbsp;<br>And I will &#8212; when this meeting is over, I will be on the phone with the Department of Defense and talking about the access to satellite capability.<br>&nbsp;<br>And &#8212; but &#8212; I&#8217;m looking down the list here.&nbsp; All right, I will follow up with you, Gov &#8212; or the Vice President will; she has a mild interest in California &#8212; with all the points you just raised, and I &#8212; and I do appreciate it.<br>&nbsp;<br>Now, I want to get to each one of you, but we&#8217;re going to ask the &#8212; I think now is the time the press is going to leave the room.&nbsp; Am I correct?<br>&nbsp;<br>(Press is ushered out.)<br>&nbsp;<br>12:34 P.M. EDT</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>WASHINGTON – Today, President Biden announced his intent to nominate and appoint individuals to serve in key roles at the U.S. Department of State and the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom:</p>



<ul><li>Rashad Hussain, Nominee for Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious Freedom</li><li>Deborah Lipstadt, Nominee for Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism with the Rank of Ambassador</li><li>Khizr Khan, Appointee for Commissioner of the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom</li><li>Sharon Kleinbaum, Appointee for Commissioner of the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom</li></ul>



<p>Today’s announcement underscores the President’s commitment to build an Administration that looks like America and reflects people of all faiths. Hussain is the first Muslim to be nominated to serve as the Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious Freedom, and Lipstadt is a renowned scholar of the Holocaust and antisemitism.</p>



<p><strong><u>Rashad Hussain, Nominee for Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious Freedom</u></strong></p>



<p>Rashad Hussain is Director for Partnerships and Global Engagement at the National Security Council.&nbsp;He previously served as Senior Counsel at the Department of Justice’s National Security Division.&nbsp;During the Obama Administration, Rashad served as U.S. Special Envoy to the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), U.S. Special Envoy for Strategic Counterterrorism Communications, and Deputy Associate White House Counsel. In his roles as Envoy, Hussain worked with multilateral organizations such as the OIC and UN, foreign governments, and civil society organizations to expand partnerships in education, entrepreneurship, health, international security, science and technology, and other areas.&nbsp;Rashad also spearheaded efforts on countering antisemitism and protecting religious minorities in Muslim-majority countries. Prior to joining the Obama Administration, Rashad worked on the House Judiciary Committee, served as a judicial law clerk to the Hon. Damon Keith on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, and was an Associate Counsel to the Obama-Biden Transition Project.&nbsp;Rashad received his J.D. from Yale Law School, where he served as an editor of the Yale Law Journal, and Master’s degrees in Public Administration (Kennedy School of Government) and Arabic and Islamic Studies from Harvard University.&nbsp;He has also taught as Adjunct Professor of Law at Georgetown Law Center and the Georgetown School of Foreign Service.&nbsp;He speaks Urdu, Arabic, and Spanish.</p>



<p><strong><u>Deborah Lipstadt, Nominee for Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism with the Rank of Ambassador</u></strong></p>



<p>Deborah&nbsp;E.&nbsp;Lipstadt is&nbsp;Dorot Professor of Modern Jewish History and Holocaust Studies at Emory University, where she was the founding director of the Institute for Jewish Studies. She&nbsp;is&nbsp;the author of&nbsp;<em>Beyond Belief: the American Press</em>&nbsp;<em>and the Coming of the Holocaust 1933-1945</em>;&nbsp;<em>History on Trial: My Day in Court with a Holocaust Denier</em>;&nbsp;<em>The Eichmann Trial</em>;&nbsp;<em>Holocaust: An American Understanding&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Antisemitism: Here and Now</em>.&nbsp;After the British writer and Holocaust denier David Irving sued her for libel, a&nbsp;ten-week trial in London in 2000 resulted&nbsp;in an overwhelming victory for Lipstadt. Lipstadt&nbsp;is currently on the Boards of the Jewish Forward Advisory Committee&nbsp;and&nbsp;the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee and serves as a judge for the Rohr Prize in Jewish Literature. She has also served in several roles at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, including&nbsp;twice as a Presidential Appointee to the Museum’s Council, and was asked by President George W. Bush to represent the White House at the 60th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz.&nbsp;Lipstadt was previously a member of the U.S. Department of State’s Advisory Committee on Religious Persecution Abroad and&nbsp;was a Board Member of Hillel International, The Defiant Requiem, and The Covenant Foundation.&nbsp;She&nbsp;has received numerous awards for her research and writing and is the recipient of nine honorary degrees.

<p>For thirty years, Carl Levin and I served together in the United States Senate. He was one of the most honorable and decent people I have ever known.<br><br>Brilliant, humble, and principled, Carl earned the trust of his constituents and colleagues by doing the work. He studied the issues in detail. He forged consensus across the aisle. He built coalitions across his beloved Michigan. With his head tilted down, his eyes peering over his glasses – Carl always looked people straight into their own eyes, listened with an open mind, and responded the way he saw it with respect.<br><br>Over the course of his thirty-six years in the Senate, the longest serving Senator in Michigan history, he showed how democracy – and our institutions – can deliver and work for the people.<br><br>As chairman and ranking member of the Armed Services Committee during my time leading the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I saw how he built consensus to protect our national security, uphold our values, and honor the service of every patriot in uniform. He led on critical issues ranging from the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons, ending the use of torture, and recognizing the dignity of every American and allowing them to serve regardless of who they are and who they love.<br><br>A son of Detroit who never forgot where he came from, Carl always stood up for the American worker and the iconic American auto industry. In the midst of the Great Recession in 2009, with Detroit on its back and the industry on the brink, we worked together to do everything we could to get them back up. And they did because of Carl.<br><br>On education, gun safety, on holding corporate America accountable for abuse and greed, and so much more – Carl always looked out for the people.<br><br>Each time I traveled to Michigan with Carl over the years was special. We would talk about how we both got first involved in public life because of issues of civil rights and first got started in elected office – he on the Detroit City Council and I on the New Castle County Council. We would talk about the beauty of the Great Lakes and the Detroit RiverWalk. Most of all, we would talk about family.<br><br>Jill and I send our love to his beloved Barbara, their children, and grandchildren. Despite the full life he lived, we know the void his loss leaves. We know despite his courageous fight against cancer, it still leaves behind a heavy toll. We’re also thinking of our dear friends, his brother and former Congressman Sandy Levin, and his nephew Congressman Andy Levin, who share Carl’s commitment to service and country.<br><br>Carl Levin embodied the character of the people of Michigan he served throughout his remarkable career. Above all, he embodied the best of who we are as Americans.<br><br>May God bless a great American, a dear friend, and a good man.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Via Teleconference</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"> (July 29, 2021)</p>



<p>10:01 A.M. EDT<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. HORNE: Good morning, everyone.&nbsp; Thanks for joining us today.&nbsp; Today’s call will be on the record, and its contents will be embargoed until 5:00 a.m. Eastern Time tomorrow &#8212; that’s Friday, July 30th.<br>&nbsp;<br>Our speakers today are going to be Senior Deputy Homeland Security Advisor Russ Travers from the National Security Council and Ambassador Tracey Jacobson from the State Department Afghanistan Coordination Task Force.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Russ, we’ll turn it over to you to get started.&nbsp; Thank you.<br>&nbsp;<br>MR. TRAVERS:&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Thanks, Emily.&nbsp; And thanks all for joining.&nbsp; As Emily said, my name is Russ Travers.&nbsp; I&#8217;m the Senior Deputy Homeland Security Advisor at the NSC.<br>&nbsp;<br>So I think you know, on the 14th of July, the White House announced Operation Allies Refuge that would support relocations of interested and eligible Afghan nationals and their families who have supported the government and are in the SIV application pipeline.&nbsp; This is not a new program.&nbsp; Helping the brave Afghans who have supported our work in Afghanistan has been a long bipartisan priority in Washington.<br>&nbsp;<br>The original NDAA authorization for Special Immigrant Visas from Iraq and Afghanistan &#8212; it was actually passed under the second Bush administration; it was re-upped in both the Obama and the Trump administrations; and we welcome strong bipartisan support for SIVs in Congress today, including the recent passage in the House of legislation in support of streamlining the application process and increasing the overall numbers of visas authorized.<br>&nbsp;<br>Since President Biden&#8217;s announcement this April that U.S. forces would be leaving Afghanistan, the administration&#8217;s immediate focus has been on interested and eligible Afghan nationals and their families who have supported the U.S. and our partners in Afghanistan and are in the SIV application pipeline.<br>&nbsp;<br>I am immensely proud to announce our first group of Afghan special immigrants to be relocated under Operation Allies Refuge is now on their way to America.&nbsp; This flight represents a fulfillment of the U.S. commitment and honors these Afghans’ brave service in helping support our mission in Afghanistan, in turn helping to keep our country safe.<br>&nbsp;<br>America has a longstanding tradition of welcoming refugees and others to the United States.&nbsp; We, alongside our civil society partners and tens of thousands of volunteers across our nation, look forward to welcoming these friends and partners to their new communities in the United States.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>They have all completed rigorous security background checks conducted by the intelligence community and the Departments of State and Homeland Security.&nbsp; And they now join the over 70,000 Afghans who have received SIVs and started new lives in the U.S. since 2008.<br>&nbsp;<br>Their arrival is the culmination of an enormous effort across the U.S. government and one that is a high moment of our careers.&nbsp; So many of us have deep, personal connections here, whether we served at Embassy Kabul, worked alongside these Afghans as diplomats or servicemembers, or worked to advance the Afghan peace process.<br>&nbsp;<br>It is important to emphasize that our first priority is relocating to the United States about 700 Afghan principal SIV applicants and their immediate families who have completed the majority of the process including a thorough background check.<br>&nbsp;<br>Including family members, we estimate there will be approximately 2,500 Afghans in this group, and we have something over 200 people on this first flight, principal applicants and their families.<br>Once these Afghan special immigrants are paroled into the U.S. and complete a medical exam as required by law, they will be resettled to cities across the country with assistance through the United States Refugee Admissions Program.&nbsp; We expect to continue relocating applicants and their families over the course of a few weeks.<br>&nbsp;<br>In closing, I want to emphasize that the safety and privacy of these brave individuals and their families has been the North Star during this entire process.&nbsp; Accordingly, we are not going to speak to any details about the routes or timing of their transit.&nbsp; You can appreciate that they are in the midst of a long, very grueling journey, and our focus right now is on welcoming them safely and protecting details that may impact the travel of future SIV arrivals.<br>&nbsp;<br>And, with that, I&#8217;ll turn thing over to Ambassador Jacobson for more detail on the State-Department-headed interagency task force.<br>&nbsp;<br>AMBASSADOR JACOBSON:&nbsp; Good morning everyone.&nbsp; On behalf of all the members of the task force, I want to say how honored and privileged we are to be working as part of the overall interagency effort on this important process.<br>&nbsp;<br>We launched this task force last Monday to bring together the expertise and the individuals from across the interagency to meet the President&#8217;s initial instruction to start relocating Afghans &#8212; Special Immigrant Visa applicants &#8212; before the end of July, but also to work together to find efficiencies to innovate, to streamline the process going forward to maximize the number of people that we will be able to relocate.<br>&nbsp;<br>And on our team, it&#8217;s not just the State Department.&nbsp; We also have Department of Homeland Security, Health and Human Services, and, of course, the Department of Defense.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>I think Russ has said most of what we have on the process, but just so you know, this initial group that we&#8217;re talking about of 700-plus principal applicants and their families that we&#8217;re bringing through, through this process, have undergone extensive screening.&nbsp; They are at the very end of the immigrant visa process, lacking only a couple of steps that we will be performing at Fort Lee.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>They have all been COVID tested.&nbsp; They&#8217;ve had a fitness-to-fly exam.&nbsp; And we have offered vaccines in Kabul to those who are interested in having them, and we will also be offering those vaccines at Fort Lee.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So, at Fort Lee, they will need a medical clearance, as required by DHS, to grant them immigrant status.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s what will be happening at Fort Lee &#8212; is that medical and the DHS processing.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And then we&#8217;re working with our partner, IOM, which will relocate people around the country.&nbsp; They&#8217;ll be taking information from them &#8212; the travelers.&nbsp; When they have particular connections in the United States &#8212; family or other connections &#8212; IOM will look to resettle them in those locations.&nbsp; And otherwise, they will go where IOM has capacity, with assistance through the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program under the State Department Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>We&#8217;re going to continue to work on this.&nbsp; We will continue to relocate eligible SIV applicants and their families who have our gratitude for their service.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>I also want to underscore that the U.S. partnership with Afghanistan is continuing.&nbsp; As Secretary Blinken said, &#8220;even as we&#8217;re withdrawing our forces, we&#8217;re remaining very much engaged in Afghanistan: supporting the government, economic assistance, development assistance, assistance for the security forces, and diplomacy to try to bring the parties together for a peaceful resolution of the conflict.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;<br>Our Consular Section in Kabul is going to continue processing SIVs.&nbsp; So we&#8217;re very much looking forward to our Afghan colleagues taking their first steps as new immigrants in our country and very pleased to join today on this call.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. HORNE: Thank you.&nbsp; Operator, we&#8217;re ready for some questions now.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you very much. &nbsp;&nbsp;A question about the other Afghans &#8212; womens leaders, human rights leaders, educators.&nbsp; Is there any plan being considered to evacuate other people who are being targeted and can be targeted by the Taliban if they want to leave beyond the SIV program?<br>&nbsp;<br>MR. TRAVERS:&nbsp; Well, as you suggest, Andrea, the SIV program is statutory.&nbsp; It has very specific requirements and would not cover many of these individuals.&nbsp; However, U.S. Embassy Kabul can make referrals to the U.S. Refugee Admission Program for any Afghans who are well known to the embassy and have both imminent and compelling protection concerns.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And this would, by definition, include women&#8217;s leaders, activists, human rights defenders, civil society, and journalists.&nbsp; So, there is that program available.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, I&#8217;d like to follow up on Andrea&#8217;s question.&nbsp; The administration has been considering doing or creating an equivalent of what &#8212; of the programs for Iraqis that has been suspended.&nbsp; It was for, I guess &#8212; I can&#8217;t remember the exact term, but it&#8217;s a special visa; it’s not an SIV.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The Iraqi program was suspended because of a fraud investigation that is still going on.&nbsp; I&#8217;m wondering if the administration is still considering creating the second category of visas for Afghans who do not meet the SIV requirements, but are U.S affiliated and under threat or other Afghans who are also under threat from the Taliban, particularly women, women pilots &#8212; that kind of person.<br>&nbsp;<br>MR. TRAVERS:&nbsp; Do you want to answer, Tracey?&nbsp; Want me to?<br>&nbsp;<br>AMBASSADOR JACOBSON:&nbsp; Sure, just to say that it&#8217;s true the administration is considering a variety of different options, and we&#8217;ll have more on that for you in the future.&nbsp; Nothing on that today.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q &nbsp;Hi. &nbsp;Thanks very much for doing the call. &nbsp;(Inaudible) kind of a logistical question. &nbsp;How long will (inaudible) the refugee program? &nbsp;I mean, obviously, we would very much like to speak with them and do stories, which I gather isn&#8217;t going to happen at Fort Lee. &nbsp;But I&#8217;d like any information you can provide about access &#8212; media access (inaudible) these folks in the coming weeks.<br>&nbsp;<br>AMBASSADOR JACOBSON:&nbsp; So, excuse me, you cut out during that call a little bit, but I think what you were asking is how long do we expect them to be at Fort Lee and can you speak to the applicants afterwards.&nbsp; So, that&#8217;s the question I&#8217;m going to answer, and if it was a different question, I apologize.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; No, no, that’s it.&nbsp; Thank you.<br>&nbsp;<br>AMBASSADOR JACOBSON:&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; So, this is the first time we&#8217;re doing this, and it&#8217;s a sort of big lift for State PRM, for DHS, and for the NGO colleagues that are working with us to process these medical exams and the DHS adjustment of status.&nbsp; We&#8217;re looking at about seven days.&nbsp; We hope, over time, to shorten that.&nbsp; But that is our planning horizon for this first flight, and we&#8217;ll see how it goes, and we will learn from the experience of this first flight and apply it to future flights.<br>&nbsp;<br>In terms of engaging with these individuals, you know, they&#8217;re entitled to their privacy.&nbsp; If any of them express an interest in speaking to the media &#8212; and some of them may &#8212; we will work to hook you up.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>But we&#8217;re not going to ask them to speak to the media given that these folks have, in recent days, left their entire lives behind and immigrated to the United States with just their luggage.&nbsp; So, we&#8217;re going to let them settle in and resettle.&nbsp; But if any of them are keen to talk to you, we&#8217;ll let you know.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, there.&nbsp; Yeah, thanks for holding the call.&nbsp; A couple of questions about the folks who are still left behind in Afghanistan.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve spoken with people in the process who say that they have a dangerous road between where they live and getting to Kabul.&nbsp; They don&#8217;t know, if they go to Kabul, how many &#8212; how long they&#8217;ll have to wait, if they&#8217;ll have to go back to their dangerous home province.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Is there any support being offered for them once they get to Kabul so they can stay there?&nbsp; And are you still considering an option of just expediting all of these applicants out to Guam or another safe area where the processing can continue and they won’t be in danger from the Taliban advances?<br>&nbsp;<br>AMBASSADOR JACOBSON:&nbsp; I’ll take that one, Russ, if you like.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>MR. TRAVERS:&nbsp; Sure, go ahead.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>AMBASSADOR JACOBSON:&nbsp; We&#8217;re going be moving folks as fast as we logistically can.&nbsp; We do lack the capacity to bring people to Kabul from other parts of the country or to house them in Kabul itself.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>While we&#8217;re focused on this initial group of applicants who are very far along in their SIV process, bringing them to the United States, we are also looking, in the coming weeks, to start moving people who are less farther along to a third-country location so that they can be safe while their visa processing continues.&nbsp; And those individuals, when they finish that processing, will be brought to the United States.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>That&#8217;s what I have for you now on that.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you so much for holding this call and for taking my question.&nbsp; What advice do you have for SIVs in Afghanistan who haven’t heard anything yet?&nbsp; Is there someone they can contact?&nbsp; Should they be reaching out to the embassy?<br>&nbsp;<br>And I have two follow-ups.&nbsp; One is: Did you say there are 750 or 250 on the flight?&nbsp; And then how long after the pullout of troops will you continue with this program?<br>&nbsp;<br>AMBASSADOR JACOBSON:&nbsp; So, I do apologize &#8212; there were three questions there.&nbsp; As to the exact number on the flight, it is just over 200.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not 250.&nbsp; We don’t want to get into exact details, but, you know, we initially manifest the flight, and then, of course, some people who test positive for COVID are not allowed to fly, and they will have to quarantine and isolate in accordance with CDC guidelines before we will put them on another flight.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>We absolutely intend to continue this program after the pullout of troops.&nbsp; In terms of who people can contact, it&#8217;s the same organization that they contact with regards to their SIV.&nbsp; It&#8217;s &#8212; the National Visa Center is the organization that fields inquiries from applicants.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>MR. TRAVERS:&nbsp; And I would just add that the 700-plus is the cohort that we&#8217;re talking about of SIVs who are at this relevant stage &#8212; have had all their security vetting &#8212; so it&#8217;s they and their families that will be looking to relocate over the coming days and weeks.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. HORNE:&nbsp; All right, thank you, everyone.&nbsp; That concludes our call.&nbsp; Reminder that the contents are embargoed until 5:00 a.m., tomorrow, Friday morning.&nbsp; And we are on the record today.<br>&nbsp;<br>Thanks all.<br>&nbsp;<br>10:17 A.M. EDT</p>

<p>Today is an important milestone as we continue to fulfill our promise to the thousands of Afghan nationals who served shoulder-to-shoulder with American troops and diplomats over the last 20 years in Afghanistan. This morning, the first flight of Operation Allies Refuge has arrived in the United States, carrying Afghans who are eligible for Special Immigrant Visas (SIV) and their families. These arrivals are just the first of many as we work quickly to relocate SIV-eligible Afghans out of harm’s way—to the United States, to U.S. facilities abroad, or to third countries—so that they can wait in safety while they finish their visa applications.<br><br>These first Afghans are able to come directly to the United States because they have already completed extensive background checks and security screening by the Intelligence Community and the Departments of State and Homeland Security. They will complete the final steps of their visa applications and required medical checks at Fort Lee, in Virginia, before traveling onward to begin their new lives in the United States.<br><br>I want to honor all those in the United States who have spoken out on behalf of these brave Afghans, including the proud community of veterans, who have consistently advocated for the Afghans who were by their side in the field in Afghanistan, often serving as translators and interpreters. And I want to thank the diplomats and public servants across our government and around the world who are working tirelessly as part of Operation Allies Refuge.<br><br>Although U.S. troops are leaving, we will continue to support Afghanistan through security assistance to Afghan forces, as well as humanitarian and development aid to the Afghan people to help them sustain their achievements of the past 20 years.&nbsp; We will also continue our diplomatic support for the peace process.&nbsp; We call for an immediate reduction in violence in Afghanistan, and for all regional actors to encourage the parties to return to negotiations without delay so that the Afghan people can achieve a durable and just political settlement that brings the peace and security they deserve.<br><br>Most of all, I want to thank these brave Afghans for standing with the United States, and today, I am proud to say to them: “Welcome home.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">East Room</p>



<p>4:23 P.M. EDT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Good afternoon.&nbsp; Today, I want to talk with you about COVID-19.<br><br>Maybe the best way to start is: In a significant part of the country, you wouldn&#8217;t have to take one of these off, you don&#8217;t have to put one on &#8212; like in my home state of Delaware, where I lived in New Castle County, where I was yesterday in Pennsylvania &#8212; because people got vaccinated.&nbsp; They got vaccinated.&nbsp; They don&#8217;t need a mask when the majority &#8212; the vast majority of people got vaccinated.&nbsp;<br><br>Now, look, I want to talk about what&#8217;s really happening &#8212; what it means, what it doesn&#8217;t mean, and what we need to do this week and the months ahead.&nbsp;<br><br>From the moment I was elected, I said I&#8217;d always give it to you straight from the shoulder, and we need some straight talk right now.&nbsp; Because there’s a lot of fear and misinformation in the country, and we need to cut through it with facts, with science, with the truth.<br><br>So, what’s really happening today?<br><br>After months and months of cases going down, we’re seeing a spike in COVID cases.&nbsp; They&#8217;re going up.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because of this new form, this new variant called the “Delta variant.&#8221;<br><br>This is a much different variant than the one we dealt with previously.&nbsp; It’s highly transmissible, and it’s causing a new wave of cases in those who are not vaccinated.<br><br>Our experts tell me that cases will go up further<br>before they start to come back down.&nbsp; But while cases are on the rise, they&#8217;re not &#8212; we’re not likely to see, according to experts, a comparable rise in hospitalizations or deaths in most areas of the country.<br><br>So, you have to ask yourself: Why is that?&nbsp; Because 164 million Americans are fully vaccinated, including 80 percent of those most vulnerable &#8212; our seniors.<br><br>So, there’s a challenge, as we knew there could be.&nbsp; But there&#8217;s also good news.<br><br>We&#8217;ve spent the last six months preparing for this possibility.&nbsp; The vaccines are highly effective.&nbsp; We have enough vaccine for everyone to get vaccinated.<br><br>And thanks to the American Rescue Plan and the hard work of the American people, we&#8217;ve administered over 325 million vaccination doses in the past six months.<br><br>We have the tools to prevent this new wave of COVID from shutting down our businesses, our schools, our society, as we saw happen last year.<br><br>I’ve said from the beginning that we will be guided by the science.&nbsp; So here’s what the science tells us:<br><br>On Tuesday, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention &#8212; the CDC &#8212; announced its new mask recommendation in parts of the country where COVID cases are substantially high, where people didn’t get vaccinated &#8212; which they define as 50 new cases for every 100,000 people in a week.<br><br>The CDC recommends you wear a mask when you’re in public and indoors, like work or in a grocery store.&nbsp; That’s true for both the vaccinated and the unvaccinated.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because even if you’ve been fully vaccinated and protected from severe illness from COVID-19, you could have the Delta variant in your system<br>and spread it to someone who isn’t vaccinated.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>We need to wear masks to protect each other and to stop the rapid spread of this virus as we work to get more people vaccinated.<br><br>And I hope all Americans who live in areas with substantial or high case rates will follow the mask guidance that’s being laid down by the CDC.&nbsp; I certainly will.&nbsp; And I have &#8212; because this is one of those areas, in Washington.&nbsp;<br><br>And at my decision &#8212; at my direction, all federal personnel and visitors to federal buildings will have to do the same thing.<br><br>As I’ve said from the beginning, a mask is not a political statement; it’s about protecting yourself and protecting others.&nbsp; Masking is one defense against the spread of COVID-19.<br><br>But make no mistake: Vaccines are the best defense against you getting severely ill from COVID-19 &#8212; the very best defense.<br><br>And you want to know how we put this virus behind us?&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, I’ll tell you how: We need to get more people vaccinated.<br><br>Look, and it&#8217;s important to understand what vaccines do and what they don&#8217;t do.&nbsp; Put simply, the vaccines are designed to save lives and prevent severe illness.&nbsp; They&#8217;re highly effective at both.&nbsp;<br><br>A hundred and ninety million Americans have had at least one shot.&nbsp; Of that group, about 90 percent are done now, and 10 percent are waiting for the second shot.&nbsp;<br><br>To those folks who have one shot but not the second: Go get the second shot.&nbsp; Even if you&#8217;re overdue for the second shot, it is not too late.&nbsp; Go get the second shot now.&nbsp; Now.&nbsp;<br><br>The bottom line is: If you&#8217;re fully vaccinated, you&#8217;re highly protected from COVID-19.&nbsp; But I also know that many of you who are vaccinated are concerned about what&#8217;s called &#8220;breakthrough cases.&#8221;&nbsp; Yes, some fully vaccinated people will still test positive, and some will show some symptoms of COVID-19.&nbsp; That&#8217;s expected with almost every vaccine there is for other diseases.&nbsp;<br><br>But breakthrough cases remain rare and almost all are mild cases.&nbsp; In fact, virtually all hospitalizations and deaths are among the unvaccinated.&nbsp;<br><br>I also know many of you are wondering if you&#8217;ll need a booster shot to add another layer of protection.&nbsp; As of now, my medical advisors say the answer is no.&nbsp; No American needs a booster now.&nbsp;<br><br>But if the science tells us there&#8217;s a need for boosters, then that&#8217;s something we&#8217;ll do.&nbsp; And we have purchased the supply &#8212; all the supply we need to be ready if that was called for.<br><br>Folks, the truth is, as more people get vaccinated, we are better protected as a nation to continue reopening safely and responsibly.&nbsp;<br><br>But we are not fully out of the woods yet, because what is happening in America right now is a pandemic &#8212; a pandemic of the unvaccinated.&nbsp; Let me say that again: It&#8217;s a pandemic of the unvaccinated.&nbsp;<br><br>There are about 90 million Americans who are eligible to get the shot but haven&#8217;t gotten it yet.&nbsp; As I just mentioned, nearly all of the cases, hospitalizations, and deaths due to COVID-19 today are from unvaccinated people.&nbsp;<br><br>Last month, a study showed that over 99 percent of COVID-19 deaths had been among the unvaccinated &#8212; 99 percent.&nbsp; This is an American tragedy.&nbsp; People are dying and will die who don&#8217;t have to die.&nbsp; If you&#8217;re out there unvaccinated, you don&#8217;t have to die.&nbsp;<br><br>Read the news and you&#8217;ll see stories about unvaccinated patients in hospitals.&nbsp; As they&#8217;re lying in bed, dying from COVID-19, they&#8217;re asking, &#8220;Doc, can I get the vaccine?&#8221;&nbsp; And the doctors have to say, &#8220;Sorry, it&#8217;s too late.&#8221;<br><br>Right now, too many people are dying or watching someone they love dying and saying, &#8220;If I just got vaccinated, if I just…&#8221;&nbsp; It&#8217;s heartbreaking.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s complicated even more because it&#8217;s preventable.&nbsp;<br><br>America is divided between the majority of eligible people who are vaccinated and those who are not.&nbsp; And I understand that many of you in the majority are frustrated with the consequences of the failure of the minority to get vaccinated.&nbsp;<br><br>But I want you to know that I&#8217;m going to continue to do everything I can to encourage the unvaccinated to get vaccinated.&nbsp; That includes addressing hesitancy and misinformation head on.&nbsp;<br><br>For example, I know some of you are &#8212; who are unvaccinated think, &#8220;The development of vaccine was rushed, therefore I&#8217;m not going to take a chance.&nbsp; As a result, I think it&#8217;s not safe because it was rushed.&#8221;&nbsp; I understand.&nbsp;<br><br>But let me explain.&nbsp; Our top scientists at the National Institute of Health &#8212; the NIH &#8212; and across the country got to work applying decades of research &#8212; decades of research &#8212; let me repeat that: decades &#8212; that have already been done &#8212; the research &#8212; to develop the COVID-19 vaccine when it hit.<br><br>In the last six months, more than 325 million doses of the vaccine have been administered in the United States and billions of doses administered around the world.&nbsp; The vaccine was developed and authorized under a Republican administration, and has been distributed and administered under a Democratic administration.&nbsp;<br><br>The vaccines are safe, highly effective.&nbsp; There&#8217;s nothing political about them.&nbsp; Look at all the people who took a shot at it.&nbsp; They later &#8212; we learned a lot of them have already been vaccinated.<br><br>From the start, I have to compliment Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.&nbsp; He hadn&#8217;t made it political.&nbsp; He&#8217;s encouraged people to get vaccinated and is continuing to do so, and his state is in pretty good shape.&nbsp;<br><br>Alabama Republican Governor Kay Ivey recently spoke out to encourage vaccination.<br><br>And even the commentators on Fox who have been belittling this for a long time &#8212; some haven&#8217;t, but many have &#8212; are arguing, &#8220;Get vaccinated.&#8221;&nbsp;<br><br>Look, this is not about red states and blue states.&nbsp; It&#8217;s literally about life and death.&nbsp; It&#8217;s about life and death.&nbsp; That&#8217;s what it&#8217;s about.&nbsp;<br><br>You know &#8212; and I know people talk about freedom.&nbsp; But I learned, growing up at school and from my parents, with freedom comes responsibility.&nbsp; Your decision to be unvaccinated impacts someone else.&nbsp;<br><br>Unvaccinated people spread the virus.&nbsp; They get sick and fill up our hospitals.&nbsp; And that means if someone else has a heart attack or breaks a hip, there may not be a hospital bed for them.</p>



<p>If you’re unvaccinated, you put your doctor and nurses at risk &#8212; the same frontline, essential workers who put their lives on the line over the past year and have gone through hell.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Again, with freedom comes responsibility.&nbsp; So, please, exercise responsible judgement.&nbsp; Get vaccinated &#8212; for yourself, for the people you love, for your country.</p>



<p>&nbsp;I’m being literal when I say this: As I travel the world, almost every day a foreign leader calls me, asking can I provide his or her country more vaccines.&nbsp;&nbsp;Their people are desperate for vaccines.</p>



<p>I’m doing everything to answer those calls.&nbsp;&nbsp;We’re sending millions of vaccines to people around the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;But, folks, it’s an American blessing that we have vaccines for each and every American.&nbsp;&nbsp;We’ve made it our first and top priority to have available vaccines for every eligible American and that’s never going to change as long as I’m here.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And it’s a shame &#8212; it’s just such a shame to squander that blessing.&nbsp;&nbsp;That’s why after six months of extraordinary work and effort, today I’m laying out additional steps we should be taking to deliver these lifesaving vaccines to more Americans.</p>



<p>First, we’re going to provide more incentives to encourage unvaccinated Americans to get vaccinated.&nbsp; That starts with paid leave to get the shot.&nbsp; We&#8217;re still hearing that people are unable to get time off from their employer to get vaccinated.&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, this is unacceptable.</p>



<p>For some time now, I’ve said you should be able to get the shot and still get paid.&nbsp; Thanks to the American Rescue Plan, the federal government is fully reimbursing any small- or medium-sized business that provides workers with paid time off to get vaccinated.</p>



<p>Employers, this costs you nothing.&nbsp; If you haven’t given employees paid time off, do it now, please.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, I’m announcing that we’re taking this a step further.&nbsp;&nbsp; The federal government will now reimburse those employers to give their staffs &#8212; who give their staffs time off not only to get themselves vaccinated, but also to get their family members vaccinated.</p>



<p>That means employers can get reimbursed if they give parents time off &#8212; with paid time, paid leave &#8212; to take their kids or their own parents to get vaccinated.&nbsp; So, I’m calling on all <s>employees</s> [employers] across the country to give paid time off to get the shot or to help a family member do so.&nbsp; I promise you: It will cost you, the employer, nothing.&nbsp; You’ll be reimbursed.</p>



<p>Secondly, I’m announcing that we’ll continue the work &#8212; to work with states to encourage unvaccinated people to get vaccinated.&nbsp; In February, the grocery store chain Kroger’s offered $100 to their associates if they’d get vaccinated.&nbsp; And it worked.&nbsp; Vaccination rates moved up from 50 cent [sic] &#8212; 50 percent to 75 percent among their employees.&nbsp;</p>



<p>States like New Mexico, Ohio, and Colorado are offering similar incentive programs that have helped increase vaccination rates.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, today, I’m calling on all states and local governments&nbsp;to use funding they have received, including from the American Rescue Plan, to give $100 to anyone who gets fully vaccinated. &nbsp;</p>



<p>I know that paying people to get vaccinated might sound unfair to folks who’ve gotten vaccinated already, but here’s the deal: If incentives help us beat this virus, I believe we should use them.&nbsp; We all benefit if we can get more people vaccinated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But in addition to providing incentives to encourage vaccination, it’s time to impose requirements on key groups to make sure they’re vaccinated.&nbsp; (Clears throat.)&nbsp; Excuse me.</p>



<p>Just this week, we took an important step to protect our veterans.&nbsp; Like many civilian hospital systems are doing, the Department of Veterans Affairs will now require COVID-19 vaccines for doctors and nurses and other healthcare workers who provide medical care for our veterans.</p>



<p>We must do everything possible to protect our veterans from getting COVID when they come to get medical care they so richly earned serving their country.&nbsp; We owe them.</p>



<p>Next, since many vaccinations are required for active duty military today, I’m asking the Defense Department to look into&nbsp;how and when they will add COVID-19 to the list of vaccinations our armed forces must get.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our men and women in uniform who protect this country from grave threats should be protected as much as possible from getting COVID-19.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think this is particularly important because our troops serve in places throughout the world, many where vaccination rates are low and disease is prevalent.</p>



<p>Next, every federal government employee will be asked to attest to their vaccination status.&nbsp; Anyone who does not attest or is not vaccinated will be required to mask no matter where they work; test one or two times a week to see if they have a &#8212; they have acquired COVID; socially distance; and generally will not be allowed to travel for work.<br><br>Likewise, today, I’m directing my administration to take steps to apply similar standards to all federal contractors.&nbsp; If you want to do business with the federal government, get your workers vaccinated.<br><br>Look at the Chamber of Commerce representing tens of thousands of American businesses.&nbsp; The National Association of Manufacturers.&nbsp; The Business Roundtable, which is comprised of the largest and biggest corporations in America.&nbsp; They’re all applauding the actions the federal government is taking, and I urge them to follow suit.&nbsp;<br><br>I also commend the National Football League that has announced that if there are outbreaks among unvaccinated players and personnel, then the team risks forfeiting games.&nbsp; I urge other sport leagues at every level to take every step they can.<br><br>Every day, more businesses are implementing their own vaccine mandates.&nbsp; And the Justice Department has made it clear that it is legal to require COVID-19 vaccines.<br><br>We all want our lives to get back to normal, and fully vaccinated work places will &#8212; will make that happen more quickly and more successfully.&nbsp; We all know that in our gut.&nbsp; With incentives and mandates, we can make a huge difference and save a lot of lives.&nbsp;<br><br>I also want to speak to families with children in school.&nbsp; We can and we must open schools this fall full time.&nbsp; It’s better for our children’s mental and emotional wellbeing, and we can’t afford another year out of the classroom.&nbsp; Every school should be open, and we’re giving them the tools to be able to do so safely.&nbsp; Even in those areas where they have a higher vaccination &#8212; they have a higher rate of COVID.&nbsp;<br><br>Through the American Rescue Plan, we’ve provided schools billions of dollars to implement safety measures: better ventilation, social distancing, and other measures.<br><br>In March, when vaccinations were scarce, I prioritized teachers and school workers by utilizing our Federal Pharmacy Program.&nbsp; Almost 90 percent of educators and school staff are now vaccinated.&nbsp;<br><br>Additionally, the CDC has provided clear guidance on how all schools can safely protect the kids and bring them back to the classroom: every student wear a mask.&nbsp; It’s that simple.<br><br>So, we’ve funded safety measures at schools, we’ve vaccinated teachers and staff, and we can mask up our kids for further protection.<br><br>But once again, there’s one more thing we need to do: Get more adolescents, ages 12 and up, vaccinated now that they’ve been cleared.&nbsp; In the past week, the good news is we’re seeing the average number of 12- to 17-year-olds getting vaccinated go &#8212; increase 22 percent per day.&nbsp;<br><br>Today, I’m asking school districts to host one last pop-up vaccination clinic over the coming weeks for kids ages 12 and up.&nbsp; We’re directing the Federal Pharmacy Program to help make that happen.<br><br>Parents, get your children vaccinated.&nbsp; You do it for so many other things right now.&nbsp;<br><br>And for kids under 12, if and when the vaccines are deemed safe for them, we’ll be prepared to get the vaccines administered as quickly and as safely as possible.<br><br>Look &#8212; and as we work to vaccinate more Americans, we’re prepared for outbreaks in areas of &#8212; where there are unvaccinated people.&nbsp;<br><br>My administration has made it clear to every governor that more federal resources are available to them.&nbsp; This includes the deployment of surge teams composed of ex- &#8212; experts from the CDC and the Federal Emergency Management Agency &#8212; the FEMA.<br><br>We’re going to continue to provide states with more testing, treatments, protective equipment, personnel, mobile vaccination clinics to stem the surge of the virus among the unvac- &#8212; unvaccinated.<br><br>The pictures of hospitals in several states overloaded with patients is unnecessary, avoidable, and tragic.&nbsp; You know, we’ll help any health system overloaded and unable to cope with a spike in cases.&nbsp; We’re ready to do that.<br><br>Let me close with this:&nbsp;If you’re at home and vaccinated but anxious or even angry, or if you’re at home and unvaccinated, unbothered and unconvinced, let’s step back and see where we are.&nbsp;<br><br>Just remember how we’ve emerged from a dark winter into a hopeful spring and summer.&nbsp; But really remember just how dark that winter was.<br><br>Over 3,600 Americans were dying each and every day.&nbsp; And now, even with the surge among the unvaccinated, we’re down to that &#8212; 300 Americans a day.&nbsp; Significant.&nbsp;<br><br>Millions of people were out of work, out of homes, out of hope, and going hungry.&nbsp; Remember those long lines of people in their automobiles waiting for a box of food to be put in their trunk?<br><br>Experts and pundits said we couldn&#8217;t get the vaccines.&nbsp; And even if we could get the vaccines, we couldn&#8217;t get them in people&#8217;s arms and couldn&#8217;t get them vaccinated.&nbsp; They predicted our economy would collapse.&nbsp; But remember how we stayed focused and how we went to work?&nbsp;<br><br>In six months, we got 164 million Americans fully vaccinated.&nbsp; And because we vaccinated so many people, put in place so many safety measures, and got economic help to businesses and people most in need, our economy is recovering.&nbsp;<br><br>More than 3 million Americans are back to work since I was sworn in &#8212; a faster job growth than any previous administration.&nbsp; Any.&nbsp;<br><br>We&#8217;re experiencing the fastest economic growth in nearly four decades.&nbsp; The best in the world as of now.&nbsp;<br><br>In fact, today&#8217;s GDP numbers show that in the first half of the year, our economy grew faster than any point in nearly 40 years.&nbsp; Our economy grew more in six months than most Wall Street forecasters expected for the entire year before we implemented our plan.&nbsp;<br><br>And just yesterday, we announced a bipartisan infrastructure deal that&#8217;s going to continue this momentum over the long term by making the most significant investment to rebuild America in nearly a century.&nbsp;<br><br>But we still have to face many challenges.&nbsp; We still have a lot of work to do as we readjust to a post-pandemic economy.&nbsp; But we have the right plan.&nbsp; We&#8217;re coming back.&nbsp; We just have to stay ahead of this virus.&nbsp;<br><br>I know this is hard to hear.&nbsp; I know it&#8217;s frustrating.&nbsp; I know it&#8217;s exhausting to think we&#8217;re still in this fight.&nbsp; And I know we hoped this would be a simple, straightforward line, without problems or new challenges.&nbsp; But that isn&#8217;t real life.&nbsp; We&#8217;re coming out of the worst public health crisis in 100 years, the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.&nbsp;<br><br>As I told you before, I carry a card in my pocket &#8212; I hope I have it with me &#8212; I have &#8212; carry a card in my pocket with the number of Americans dead from COVID-19.&nbsp; As of today &#8212; this morning &#8212; the total deaths in the United States were 609,441.&nbsp; Granted, the death rate per day is way down; it&#8217;s down to 400, about, dead.&nbsp;<br><br>But that&#8217;s more deaths than World War One, World War Two, Vietnam, 9/11, Iraq, and Afghanistan wars combined. &nbsp;This is as tough as it gets.&nbsp;<br><br>We’re Americans.&nbsp; When we get knocked down, we get back up.&nbsp; That&#8217;s who we are.&nbsp; That&#8217;s what we do.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why there&#8217;s no nation on Earth like us.<br><br>And we&#8217;re prepared like never before.&nbsp; We have the tools to save lives, to keep our economy growing and growing and going.<br><br>After the past six months, following the science, we know we can dramatically lower the cases in this country.&nbsp; We can do this.&nbsp; We brought our economy back to life, and we kept it going.&nbsp; We know we can send our kids back to school.&nbsp; We know we can beat this virus.&nbsp; We can do this.&nbsp; We all just have to do our part.&nbsp;<br><br>My fellow Americans, this nation has never failed when we have come together as the United States of America.&nbsp; So I say to all those who are unvaccinated: Please &#8212; please get vaccinated.&nbsp;<br><br>And to the rest of America: This is no time to be despondent or let our guard &#8212; our guard down.&nbsp; We just need to finish the job with science, with facts, with the truth.&nbsp; And together, as Americans, we&#8217;re going to be able to beat this.<br><br>May God bless you all.&nbsp; May God protect our troops.&nbsp; Thank you.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. President, how long do you think it might be necessary to wear masks?&nbsp; And at what point do you think people might have to have a booster shot?&nbsp; Thank you.<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; I said it in my talk: The booster shot is not needed now.&nbsp; It is possible that it will be needed later.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know &#8212; they don&#8217;t &#8212; the science hasn&#8217;t dictated that yet.&nbsp; And the fir- &#8212; first part of your question?<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How long do you think people might have to wear a mask again?&nbsp;<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Well, if you notice, a lot of places, people don&#8217;t have to wear masks.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s get that straight.&nbsp; The places where people have gotten vaccinated, where we have a high vaccination rate, people do not have to wear a mask at all.&nbsp;<br><br>Like some of you were with me yesterday when I was up in Lehigh Valley.&nbsp; Didn&#8217;t have to wear a mask there.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t have to mask if you come home to Delaware with me &#8212; I know you love doing that.&nbsp; But you don&#8217;t have to wear a mask.&nbsp; The places people are probably going to have to wear masks: in those communities where the high rate of unvaccinated stays high and they don&#8217;t move &#8212; they don&#8217;t move to getting vaccinated.&nbsp;<br><br>But I think you&#8217;re going to find the patience of businesses and the patience of a lot of other people running thin.&nbsp; Because the fact is, if you had high vaccination rates, you &#8212; we wouldn&#8217;t be in the spot right now.<br><br>Yes.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. President, will this set up a &#8212; an American workplace for federal workers and private sector that really is the vaccinated versus the unvaccinated?&nbsp; And is that a pressure you&#8217;re trying to harness now?&nbsp;<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Well, no, I&#8217;m not &#8212; look, what I&#8217;m trying to do is keep people safe.&nbsp; I mean that sincerely.&nbsp;<br><br>So, if in fact you&#8217;re unvaccinated, you present a problem to yourself, to your family, and to those with whom you work.&nbsp; Because as pointed out &#8212; I was asked the question about, &#8220;Why would people who have already been vaccinated get it?&#8221;&nbsp; Well, you got anywhere from 2 to 3 percent, on average &#8212; the last study done &#8212; that can still get COVID.&nbsp; They don&#8217;t get very sick.&nbsp; They don&#8217;t get hospitalized.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not serious, but they can catch it.&nbsp;<br><br>And the concern is they may be able to pass it on.&nbsp; And so, that&#8217;s all being studied right now.&nbsp; But it&#8217;s important &#8212; thing is, if people are vaccinated, the transmission rate drops through the floor.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s all we&#8217;re trying to do.&nbsp;<br><br>Yes.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. President, thank you.&nbsp; Why not push for vaccine mandates in states, private companies, schools?&nbsp; Do you want to see those entities pass vaccine mandates?&nbsp;<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Well, I &#8212; I&#8217;d like to see them continue to move in that direction, and that&#8217;s why I point it out.&nbsp; I had asked the Justice Department to determine whether that is &#8212; they&#8217;re able to do that legally, and they can.&nbsp; Local communities can do that.&nbsp; Local businesses can do that.&nbsp;<br><br>It&#8217;s still a question whether the federal government can mandate the whole country.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know that yet.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. President, you said, earlier this week, that we are not headed back towards lockdowns.&nbsp; But if the science is evolving, how can you be so confident in that?&nbsp; You heard &#8212; we heard you saying, weeks ago, that &#8220;the virus [was] on the run,&#8221; but Dr. Fauci has also indicated that we are headed in the wrong direction.&nbsp;<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Well, look, you&#8217;re take &#8212; you&#8217;re literally correct on everything you said, but it doesn&#8217;t make &#8212; come to the conclusion you&#8217;re implying.&nbsp;<br><br>It is clear that if everybody is vaccinated, the existing vaccines work to prevent death, serious illness, hospitalization.&nbsp; Okay?&nbsp; If every &#8212; so, if tomorrow I can wave a wand and every American was vaccinated, then in fact we&#8217;d be out of the woods.&nbsp;<br><br>Now, can something else happen a year from now?&nbsp; Can there be a different virus?&nbsp; Can there be something?&nbsp; It&#8217;s possible.&nbsp; But I&#8217;m talking about COVID and the existing variants that have come forward so far.&nbsp;<br><br>So, it makes a &#8212; it&#8217;s a simple proposition: If you&#8217;re vaccinated, you find yourself in a situation where you are &#8212; highly unlikely, even if you somehow get the virus; very small percentage do &#8212; that you are not going to be hospitalized, you&#8217;re not going to be on a ventilator, you&#8217;re not going to be sick, but you could be in a position to possibly spread it to someone who wasn&#8217;t if you have it in you.&nbsp;<br><br>Yes.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. President, thank you.&nbsp; I wanted to ask: Why not require that the people show proof that they&#8217;re vaccinated?&nbsp; And also, if you could just &#8212; with the 4 million, how much of an impact do you think this will have?&nbsp; Do you have a projection, sir?<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; A projection on what?<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On how many people will get vaccinated by putting in this system?<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; No, I can&#8217;t &#8212; I&#8217;m not going to get in business of projecting &#8212; I &#8212; exactly how many people are likely.&nbsp; All I know is that we go through these periods, then we run up against a wall, then something happens where people realize, &#8220;Oh, my lord, this is really a problem,&#8221; and they begin to see things.&nbsp;<br><br>Look, the fact that a lot of your friends are now saying, &#8220;Get vaccinated,&#8221; who were &#8212; before were saying, &#8220;This is not a problem.&nbsp; This is all a Democratic thing.&#8221;&nbsp; With a small &#8220;d&#8221; and a capital &#8220;D.&#8221;&nbsp; I mean, there&#8217;s a lot changing.&nbsp; People are becoming aware.&nbsp; The more aware they become, then we have these surges of people going out and getting vaccinated &#8212;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But what about requiring proof &#8212;<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; &#8212; and it just keeps building.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#8217;m sorry, sir.<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; What about what?<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What about requiring proof, sir?<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Well, that is &#8212; there&#8217;s two ways to do it, and I think you&#8217;re going to see some institutions doing that.&nbsp; Like you&#8217;re going to fly abroad, you got to &#8212; you&#8217;re going to have to have proof.&nbsp; You&#8217;re not just going to be able to say, &#8220;Yeah, I got tested.&#8221;&nbsp; You got to pri- &#8212; provide proof.&nbsp;<br><br>My guess is: If we don’t start to make more progress, a lot of businesses and a lot of enterprises are going to require proof for you to be able to participate.<br><br>In the back.&nbsp; And then I&#8217;m going to take off, shortly here.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What further actions are you going to take to encourage private businesses to follow this type of model to either require vaccines or require testing or other preventative procedures?&nbsp;<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; I just did.&nbsp; And I&#8217;m going to keep at it.&nbsp; I&#8217;m going to be talking about it around the country.&nbsp; I&#8217;m &#8212;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are you &#8212; but are you going to reach out to private businesses, meet with them, try and actively encourage them to follow this model?<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Well, I have.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why we have folks from the &#8212; everyone from the Chamber of Commerce to the manufacturers, et cetera.&nbsp; So, you know, I am &#8212; am I going to call a meeting of every, you know, business in the country to come to Washington?&nbsp; And &#8212; or go on &#8212;<br><br>I have made the case repeatedly.&nbsp; I doubt whether there&#8217;s a single, solitary business that doesn’t understand that I think I think it&#8217;s smart for them to require testing, require &#8212; and if you &#8212; if you can&#8217;t demonstrate, you can&#8217;t prove you&#8217;ve been vaccinated, you have to be tested.<br><br>Q &nbsp;Secretary Austin said he was already considering mandating &#8212;<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Yep.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; the vaccine after it was fully approved.&nbsp; Would you like to see the mandate go into effect before full approval?&nbsp; And do you think he&#8217;s open to that?<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; I know he&#8217;s open to it.&nbsp; And the question is: When is the right time to get the most bang for the buck when you do it?&nbsp; A lot of this is timing.&nbsp; And so, I think it&#8217;s going to happen, but I &#8212; look, the one thing that you all are politely and appropriately referencing is that it&#8217;s still a temporary approval.&nbsp; So when does the final approval come?&nbsp; It usually takes a lot of &#8212; a lot of work to get &#8212; to get there.<br><br>I made a commitment I would not tell anyone in the Justice Department who they should prosecute and I would not tell the health industry that they &#8212; excuse me, the government health entities what they should say and do.&nbsp; But my expectation is they&#8217;re going to reach that conclusion in the early fall.&nbsp;<br><br>Thank you very much.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. President, one more.&nbsp; Mr. President, you said &#8212; Mr. President, you said &#8212; Mr. President, you said, &#8220;If you are fully vaccinated, you no longer need to wear a mask.&#8221;&nbsp; And it seems &#8212;<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; No, I didn&#8217;t say that.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You did.&nbsp; I have the quote.<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; I said if you&#8217;re fully vaccinated in an area where you do not have &#8212; well, let me clarify it.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In May, you made it sound like a vaccine was &#8212;<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Well, in May, that&#8217;s true.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; the ticket to losing the mask forever, and it &#8212;<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; That &#8212; that is true at the time, because I thought there were people who were going to understand that getting vaccinated made a gigantic difference.&nbsp; And what happen was: A new variant came along, they didn&#8217;t get vaccinated, it was spread more rapidly, and people &#8212; more people were getting sick.&nbsp; That&#8217;s the difference.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How is the First Lady, sir?<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; I&#8217;m going to find out in a minute.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m leaving.&nbsp;<br><br>5:01 P.M. EDT</p>
