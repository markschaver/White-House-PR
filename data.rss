<p class="has-text-align-center">James S. Brady Press Briefing Room</p>



<p>12:42 P.M. EDT<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Hi, everyone.<br><br>Q    Hello.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Happy Thursday.  (Laughter.)  Is it Thursday?<br><br>Q    (Inaudible) “Happy Birthday”?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  I said, &#8220;Happy Thursday.&#8221;  Well, I was going to say &#8212; I did hear it was Steve Holland&#8217;s 29th birthday.  (Laughter.)  So, happy 29th birthday.  I am a terrible singer, but I am willing to lead a song here if you are all game.  (Laughter.)<br><br>Q    Is this a good day to ask for an interview with the President?  (Laughter.) <br><br>MS. PSAKI:  It may be.  It may be.<br><br>Q    You got to at least give him the first question.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Who&#8217;s with me?  Someone here has a good voice.<br><br>(&#8220;Happy Birthday&#8221; is sung to Steve Holland.)  (Applause.)<br><br>All right.  I will also note: Brian Karem, excellent voice.  I don&#8217;t know what you do with that, but that&#8217;s one thing I learned today.  (Laughter.)<br><br>Okay, a couple of items for you.  Today, as you all know, the President and Vice President will meet with Black leaders from top civil rights organizations.  We are about to put out the list of these names if they are not already in your inbox.  But that is happening this afternoon.  We&#8217;ll have a readout.  We also expect a number of them will go out to the stakeout after the meeting.<br><br>Later today, Vice President Harris will also deliver remarks at Howard University on how the Democratic National Committee is expanding their “I Will Vote” campaign, for which the DNC can give you additional specifics.<br><br>As the President has been emphatic since taking of- &#8212; before taking office, our constitutional rights are on the line because state legislatures have forced through a wave of anti-voter laws based on the same repeatedly disproven lies that led to an assault on our nation’s Capitol in one of the darkest days in the history of American democracy. <br><br>So the meeting today, the Vice President&#8217;s event are a part of our ongoing effort to elevate this issue, to work with every lever of the federal government.<br><br>I also wanted to note, as you may have noticed, we&#8217;ve been doing kind of a daily announcement about our competition executive order.  So the new announcement that went out today will &#8212; focuses on saving American businesses money on shipping costs.  In turn, that will lower prices for American consumers.<br><br>A lot of American companies rely on railroads to ship their goods domestically and ocean carriers to ship their goods internationally.  Both of these industries have grown more concentrated over time.  Many freight routes are monopolized because they’re served by a single railroad.  Three foreign-owned shipping alliances now control more than 80 percent of the market.  I did not know that.  I&#8217;m learning something new every day with the competition EOs, which I appreciate.<br><br>That concentration has contributed to a spike in shipping costs and fees during the pandemic.  For example, the index price to ship one container has gone up eightfold.  And shipping container companies have charged companies massive fees while their goods sit at ports.<br><br>So, this executive order takes several steps to address these problems.  On international shipping, the executive order calls on the Federal Maritime Commission to crack down on unjust and unreasonable fees and work with the Justice Department to investigate and punish anticompetitive conduct.</p>



<p>And on domestic freight railroad, the executive order urges the Surface Transportation Board to allow more shippers &#8212; allow shippers to more easily challenge inflated rates when there is no competition between routes.<br><br>Finally, today we also have more doses that are going out to the world.&nbsp; We will ship 500,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine to Uruguay and 1.4 million doses of Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine to Afghanistan. In the coming days, we will complete the entire 3 million shipment of J&amp;J doses to Afghanistan &#8212; something the President will also mention in his remarks today.</p>



<p>Zeke, why don&#8217;t you kick us off.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; Yesterday, the President said he would know more today about what he would do in response to Russian ransomware attacks on U.S. entities.&nbsp; What does he plan on doing?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, first, Zeke, I think what he intended to convey is that he&#8217;s continuing to be updated by his team on a regular and near-daily basis.&nbsp; And certainly, when they have new information to provide, they provide that to him.&nbsp;<br><br>So, we are continuing to gather details on if this incident occurred with the knowledge or approval of the Russian government.&nbsp; That&#8217;s what we&#8217;re really digging into at this point in time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And while the intelligence community has not yet attributed the attack and we still don&#8217;t have new information on the attribution as of today, the cyber community &#8212; security community agrees that the criminal group, REvil, that we&#8217;ve talked about a bit in here, operates out of Russia with affiliates around the world.&nbsp;<br><br>We&#8217;ve been in touch at a high level, as you all know, with Russian &#8212; high-level Russian authorities &#8212; counterparts, I should say &#8212; regarding this incident.&nbsp; And we&#8217;ve continued to send a clear message: If the Russian government cannot or will not act against criminal actors residing in Russia, we will act.</p>



<p>In terms of what we will do, I&#8217;m not in a position, of course, to discuss operations.&nbsp; That&#8217;s not in our interest to preview those.&nbsp; But the President sent a clear message to President Putin; we&#8217;re continuing to send that clear message in our engagements as well.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, on Afghanistan, on the SIV process, any updates on the administration&#8217;s efforts to find a third country to host processing of those visas, as well as can you confirm the administration is adding additional staff to help vet those applicants?&nbsp; And how long will that take, and how is the administration going to address security concerns among those who are applying for visas here?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; Well, one of the areas the President will talk about in his remarks this afternoon is certainly ensuring that we are taking care of Afghan nationals who worked side by side with U.S. forces, and the SIV applicants, as you noted, including interpreters and translators.<br><br>So we have already dramatically accelerated the processing time for Special Immigrant Visas to bring them to the United States.&nbsp; We&#8217;re working closely with Congress &#8212; we&#8217;re continuing to work closely with Congress to change the authorizing legislation so that we can streamline the process for approving visas, even when they are in a third country.&nbsp; And we have stood up an operation to physically relocate thousands of these Afghans and their families before the U.S. military mission concludes so that they can wait safely outside of Afghanistan.</p>



<p>That operation has identified U.S. facilities outside of the continental United States, as well as third countries.&nbsp; Because of security reasons, we&#8217;re not going to outline in detail at this point where those are.&nbsp; But I can confirm that we will be conducting flights of our Afghan allies to these locations in August, so, of course, in advance of the timeline of bringing our troops home.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, we&#8217;re going to hear from the President later, but is it an acceptable outcome to the President if Kabul were to fall to the Taliban?&nbsp; I mean, that&#8217;s widely been predicted by experts, including in the U.S. mil- &#8212; in the U.S. government as a potential outcome here of the U.S. withdrawal.&nbsp; Is that an acceptable outcome to the President?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, first, Zeke, let me say what &#8212; the reason the President is speaking to all of you and the American public today is because he views this as an opportunity to once again communicate to the American people the security challenges he inherited in Afghanistan and affirm why he made the decision he made in April to withdraw our troops and end our involvement in the war.<br><br>And the question fundamentally facing him was: After 20 years, was he going to commit more American troops to a civil war in Afghanistan?&nbsp; And if we look back 20 years ago, which many people in this room covered when Steve was 9 years old &#8212; I&#8217;ll just &#8212; by math &#8212; (laughter) &#8212; we &#8212; we did what we wanted to do, which was we got the terrorists who attacked us on 9/11, we delivered justice to Osama bin Laden, we degraded al Qaeda&#8217;s capacity to the point they did not present an active threat to our homeland.<br><br>He made the decision after a clear-eyed assessment, in part because he’s never seen there to be a military end to this war, and also because, as we came into office, we had an agreed-to timeline.&nbsp; After May 1st, the uptick in violence was coming this summer; the status quo was not sustainable.&nbsp;<br><br>And we are still continuing to support diplomatically &#8212; through security assistance, humanitarian assistance &#8212; the ongoing efforts in Afghanistan, including a political negotiation process that&#8217;s ongoing that we expect the ambassador to continue to return to.&nbsp;<br><br>So, we have always anticipated, Zeke &#8212; and the President was very clear about this when he made his speech in April &#8212; that there would be an uptick in violence, that there would be an uptick in turmoil on the ground.&nbsp; We knew that, and we knew the security situation would become more difficult.&nbsp;<br><br>But he made the decision in part because, if you look back at recent history: In 2011, the NATO Allies and partners agreed that we would end our combat mission by 2014.&nbsp; In 2014, some argued for more &#8212; for one more year.&nbsp; So we kept fighting, kept taking casualties.&nbsp;<br><br>If we did not make the decision we did, there would have been severe consequences.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why he made it.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you believe it&#8217;s still &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Go ahead.&nbsp; Oh, go ahead, Steve.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you believe it&#8217;s still possible that the Afghan Security Forces can repel the Taliban?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, certainly, under &#8212; as we expected, the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces are now under real pressure, and that was certainly a part of the discussion the President had with Afghan leaders just two weeks ago.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re going to continue to provide funding and ensure they have capacity to maintain the Air Force.<br><br>And I would remind you that even since we were &#8212; since we engaged, together with our NATO Allies and partners, we have trained and equipped nearly 300,000 currently-serving members of the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces.<br><br>And one of the clear messages that the President sent directly in the meeting he had and he will continue to convey is that it is now time for them to be in the lead.&nbsp; They are in the lead as we pull our troops back, and we will continue to support them with security assistance and ongoing training.&nbsp; And we have &#8212; continue to have the authorities that we&#8217;ve long had through our withdrawal later this summer.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, separately, do you have an update on Haiti &#8212; the search for the killers of the president there?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have a &#8212; an extensive update, I will say, Steve.&nbsp; We continue to be engaged; of course, in touch through a range of channels, but we don&#8217;t have updates at this point.<br><br>The Haitian authorities are, of course, leading the investigation, which is, of course, in its early stages.&nbsp; We&#8217;re ready and willing to support Haitian authorities, but we&#8217;re going to let the investigation play out.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A follow-up on Haiti, please.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Go ahead, April.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is this administration doing, in the midst of this assassination, to stand up the Haitian democracy in the midst of this?&nbsp; What is this administration doing?&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, first, I would say that it is still &#8212; it is our view and we continue to call for elections to happen this year.&nbsp; And we believe they should proceed.&nbsp;<br><br>We know that free and fair elections will facilitate a peaceful transfer of power to a newly elected President, and we certainly continue to support Haiti&#8217;s democratic institutions.&nbsp; We will call on all political parties, civil society, and stakeholders to work together in the wake of the tragedy and echo acting &#8212; the acting prime minister&#8217;s call for calm.<br><br>We have not re- &#8212; offi- &#8212; received an official request for assistance, a formal request, but we stand ready to receive that when it comes in.<br><br>I&#8217;ve got to move on, April, because we have limited time.&nbsp;<br><br>Go ahead, Jeff.&nbsp;&nbsp;Go ahead, Jeff.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; Is this speech this afternoon by the President considered the final word by the White House, at least, as America&#8217;s longest war draws down?&nbsp; Or does the President plan to mark this in some other way when all of the troops are out?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, Jeff, I would say that we &#8212; we are &#8212; the President will continue to update the American people, as Commander-in-Chief, why he&#8217;s making choices to &#8212; that are in our national security interests.&nbsp; Today is an example of that.&nbsp; And today is an opportunity to communicate again why he made the decision he made and communicate again why it&#8217;s in our interests.&nbsp;<br><br>So, I&#8217;m not going to rule out when &#8212; if he will or won’t speak on Afghanistan in the future.&nbsp;<br><br>In terms of plans for the end &#8212; for our men and women coming back, I don&#8217;t have anything to preview, but we don&#8217;t &#8212; we&#8217;re not going to have a “Mission Accomplished” moment in this regard.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a 20-year war that has not been won militarily.&nbsp;<br><br>We are proud of the men and women who have served &#8212; incredibly grateful.&nbsp; The President will note that in his remarks today &#8212; how grateful he is for their service and the families who have sacrificed over the last 20 years.&nbsp; And we will continue to press for a political outcome and a political solution.&nbsp;<br><br>But beyond that, I think we&#8217;re going to continue to look for ways to communicate why we make the choices we make.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You mentioned “Mission Accomplished.”&nbsp; Has this mission not been accomplished?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would say, we did exactly what we wanted to do.&nbsp; What I was referring to, Jeff, is we&#8217;re not having a moment of celebration.&nbsp; We&#8217;re having a moment where we feel is in our national security interests to bring our men and women serving home.&nbsp; And we feel it&#8217;s in our national security interests for Afghan forces to be in the lead.&nbsp;<br><br>We did exactly what we intended to do, and certainly that is something, thanks to the leadership of our military, we have achieved.&nbsp; However, there is not benefit, in our view, in continuing to fight this war militarily.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.&nbsp; If the military withdrawal is 90 percent complete at this point, why wait until August to finish that?&nbsp; Is there an effort to stall because of this situation &#8212; because of the conditions that are worsening?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I would say, Rachel, that that is under the purview of the Department of Defense, and they&#8217;re doing &#8212; bringing our troops home in a way that is &#8212; keeps them safe.&nbsp; We have not had a single casualty, as I &#8212; as, I think, everyone has noted, and we will continue to keep that as our priority.&nbsp;<br><br>But in terms of the operational timeline, speed is safety, but we also want to manage our withdrawal in a way that protects our service members, makes sure that we are conducting our drawdown in a way that keeps that as the top priority.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And just a quick follow-up: Is the administration considering granting visas to vulnerable women in the region, including prominent activists, politicians, or journalists?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We maintain a range of contingencies and plan for a range of operational options, but I don&#8217;t have anything to preview on that front.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, thank you.&nbsp; If it turns out that the Afghan forces are not equipped and the Taliban has a complete takeover, would the President consider sending U.S. troops back into Afghanistan?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I&#8217;m not going to get into a hypothetical.<br><br>Go ahead.&nbsp; Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I had a question on something you briefly mentioned yesterday.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The President said he would deliver a message to Putin, which he already did last month.&nbsp; So, when he said that yesterday, did he mean he has a new message for Putin?&nbsp; And under what circumstances will he deliver that?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I think, in the context of the Q&amp;A, he meant, “I&#8217;m not going to provide to you an update of the briefing I just received.”&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But he said he had a message to deliver.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; But that was the context of how he answered that question.<br><br>Go ahead.&nbsp; Go ahead, Jacqui.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; On ransomware, in terms of the Kaseya hack, does the administration consider this to be an escalation, given that it didn&#8217;t attack one entity but hundreds of entities?&nbsp; And does the U.S. consider it to be critical infrastructure in any way, given how it hampered transactions for grocery stores and that kind of thing?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; Well, first, I would say, critical infrastructure, broadly speaking, would perhaps take out an entire se- &#8212; economic sector in the country.&nbsp; But that doesn&#8217;t mean we don&#8217;t take every cyberattack, every ransom attack incredibly seriously.<br><br>And as it relates to the impact here &#8212; or how we&#8217;re evaluating it, I should say &#8212; there has been an escalation of ransomware attacks over the course of the last several years.&nbsp; It&#8217;s been a growing &#8212; an escalating problem that even predates President Biden.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s not just the United States; it&#8217;s something that&#8217;s happening around the world.&nbsp;<br><br>So, we know it&#8217;s not going to be turned off with a light switch.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not an up and down.&nbsp; We know that this needs to be ongoing engagement, and we&#8217;ll have to assess, over 6 months and 12 months, what our success looks like.&nbsp; So that&#8217;s how we&#8217;re looking at our impact as it relates to the cyber threats.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, in the conversation with Russia about, you know, enforcing this red line that the President drew at the summit, what concrete asks have we made of Russia in terms of cracking down on actors that are within that state and clearly are attacking our companies here?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; I would say the President hasn&#8217;t minced words.&nbsp; And should he speak with President Putin again &#8212; to Weijia’s question &#8212; he will convey the same message, which is: We &#8212; if you do not take action to crack down on criminal actors in your country, even if the government didn&#8217;t know, we will.&nbsp; We reserve that option too.&nbsp; And that is &#8212; continues to be his clear message.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there a timeline, though, on that?&nbsp; Is &#8212; have we given Russia, you know, two weeks to do something?&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I&#8217;m not going to preview that for you all.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I want to go to the meeting yesterday between the Chicago mayor &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; and the President.&nbsp; Can you talk at all about the request that she made of the administration in order to crack down on crime in that city?&nbsp; There was a report that she requested federal support.&nbsp; Did that involve troop presence in any way?&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t &#8212; I don&#8217;t have any summary of the conversation in that regard.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s something they&#8217;ve read out from their ends.&nbsp;<br><br>From our end, what the President conveyed to Mayor Lightfoot is that he will continue to work with her, in partnership, and work with cities around the country to address the rise of cri- &#8212; of violence and, specifically, the rise of gun violence was &#8212; is predominantly the driver in Chicago.&nbsp;<br><br>He also reiterated that, as the Department of Justice had announced just a few weeks ago, Chicago is one of the cities that will be a beneficiary of these groups that will go and help them &#8212; help directly crack down on combating drug violence and drug traffic- &#8212; I mean, sorry, gun violence and gun trafficking &#8212; something that we&#8217;re doing in about a half a dozen cities across the country.&nbsp; And he also reiterated his continued efforts at the federal level to crack down on the illegal passing of guns.<br><br>So there has been a great deal of funding that has been provided already to the city of Chicago &#8212; Cook County, specifically &#8212; and certainly some of that can be used to address crime as well.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How is the DOJ’s strike force going to specifically interrupt the networks that are trafficking these guns?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; They&#8217;re work &#8212; going to work directly with the city.&nbsp; They&#8217;re doing them &#8212; we&#8217;re doing these strike forces in about five cities around the country, and they want to work directly with them to use legal authorities to crack down on illegal gun trafficking and work in partnership with law enforcement authorities in the cities and add that additional heft and &#8212; and resources.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And lastly, is there any push to, you know, fund more efforts to equip police departments?&nbsp; There&#8217;s &#8212; you know, the White House position was that Republicans defunded police. Obviously, the Biden administration has talked a lot about the budget proposal for the COPS program, but there&#8217;s been some pressure that the administration hasn&#8217;t vocally enough talked about this spike in crime.&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would say the President gave an entire speech on it and will continue to speak about what he&#8217;s doing.&nbsp; A big driver of the rise in crime is gun violence &#8212; a personal passion of his for decades.&nbsp;<br><br>I will say that there are a number of components &#8212; I know you referenced the budget &#8212; but the President called &#8212; called for a $300 million increase in funding for the COPS program.&nbsp; That&#8217;s up from two hun- &#8212; from $237 million in the last budget passed by President Trump to $537 million.&nbsp; And he also calls for an increase of $753 million over 2021 levels to federal law enforcement agencies.&nbsp; It includes ATF &#8212; the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives.&nbsp; It also includes a $10.2 billion &#8212; an increase of $465 million over 2021 &#8212; enacted for the FBI.<br><br>Go ahead, Steve.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah, back on Haiti, just for a second, Jen.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are you in a position to describe or detail some of the assistance the U.S. is standing ready to offer Haiti if asked?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I think we have to wait to see what their formal request is.&nbsp; And we stand ready to respond rapidly to whatever they &#8212; their needs are on the ground, but they&#8217;re the best equipped to assess that.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you describe how the President views security and stability in Haiti vis-à-vis American interests today?&nbsp; I mean, I ask that because there&#8217;s a clip of the President in 1994, when he was a senator, comparing the situation in Haiti to the then-ongoing Bosnian War, in which he said something to the effect of &#8212; you know, he called it a godawful thing to say, but he said, “Haiti could sink into the Caribbean Sea or rise 300 feet in the air, and it wouldn&#8217;t matter to American interests.”&nbsp; Does he stand by that view today, or has he changed his view on Haiti?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would say: First, the fact that he is now sitting as President of the United States &#8212; he issued a statement in his voice yesterday about the horrific killing of the President &#8212; and he has made clear to the administration and administration officials that we are &#8212; stand ready to assist in any way they need, whether it&#8217;s in the investigation or other federal assistance we can offer from here &#8212; sends you a clear message about his care and concern for the people of Haiti.<br><br>Go ahead, Kelly.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The administration and the President has, in some way, included in the calculus on Afghanistan the American public&#8217;s view that it&#8217;s time to bring U.S. forces home.&nbsp; Is the President believing that the American people would be satisfied with Kabul falling, with the threat to women and children there, and with some ill-defined numbers about how many of the Afghan interpreters, translators, support are able to be removed safely from the country? &nbsp;Does the President feel the American people factored those risks into that judgement about bringing troops home?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Look, I think at the end of the day, Kelly, the President feels that the American people elected him to serve as Commander-in-Chief, make decisions that are in our national interests.&nbsp; It doesn&#8217;t mean they&#8217;re always easy, and it doesn&#8217;t mean there aren&#8217;t drawbacks to the decisions that he makes.&nbsp; But he is not going to ask another generation of kids to go and serve in Afghanistan in a war that he does not feel can be won militarily, and that is the core driver of his decision here.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On REvil, quickly: You mentioned that it&#8217;s now the assessment of the administration that they were responsible and that part of their criminal enterprise is working outside of Russia.&nbsp; You mentioned that the U.S. is in touch with high-level Russian entities.&nbsp; Is there also outreach to specific locations where our cyber resources know their actors are at work?&nbsp; Is that happening as well?&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I used that context because I think it&#8217;s important for people to understand that even though the cybersecurity community has assessed it was REvil, we know they operate in different parts of the world.&nbsp; So even as we&#8217;re directing and we&#8217;re having a conversation largely about Russia&#8217;s knowledge, we &#8212; as we assess and before we make an official assessment by the United States government, we look at that.<br><br>But, certainly, as concerns arise, we&#8217;d certainly be in touch with countries as relevant.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Inaudible.)<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Of course, yeah.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, thanks.&nbsp; On voting rights, the Supreme Court has upheld the voting laws in Arizona.&nbsp; Democrats don&#8217;t have the votes to pass the latest voting rights bill.&nbsp; What specifically can the President and the White House do to increase voting access without filibuster reform?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, first, I would say that, one, there are a number of announcements being made by the Democratic National Committee today &#8212; which is most appropriate for them to address &#8212; that the Vice President will be elevating.&nbsp;<br><br>You&#8217;ve also seen that we&#8217;ve taken steps from our Department of Justice to use legal action, where relevant and where legal &#8212; where the law allows for, to push back on and take action in states where it is &#8212; where legislation is making it more difficult or where laws are making it more difficult for people to vote.&nbsp;<br><br>We also believe very much that empowering and engaging activists and creating grassroots movements &#8212; something that the Vice President is continuing to play a very prominent and prevalent role in doing &#8212; is also a part of how we&#8217;re going to work to fight legislation and fight actions to suppress voters around the country.&nbsp;<br><br>So, certainly, the President would love to sign a piece of voting rights legislation into law.&nbsp; He is &#8212; looks forward to doing that.&nbsp; But he also knows that there are a number of levers from the federal government that we should continue to use, and he&#8217;s not waiting to have the legislation on his desk.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And one more on the Olympics.&nbsp; You know, fans have been banned from attending the Summer Games.&nbsp; Is it your assessment this is still safe for U.S. athletes?&nbsp; And has there been a determination on whether the First Lady will be attending?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure, well, I would say the President supports the Tokyo Olympic Games and the public health measures necessary to protect athletes, staff, and spectators.&nbsp; He has pride in the U.S. athletes who have trained for the Tokyo Games and will be competing in the best traditions of the Olympic spirit.&nbsp;<br><br>The government of Japan has stressed that public health remains a central priority as they host the Games &#8212; or they prepare to host the Games.&nbsp; And we&#8217;ve stayed in close contact with the Japanese government throughout the planning process and on related public health measures.&nbsp;<br><br>So we&#8217;re well aware of the careful preparations, including the public health measures necessary to protect athletes, staff, and spectators that the government and international committee has undertaken, which is why, as we&#8217;ve said, we support the Games moving forward.<br><br>In terms of the First Lady, we&#8217;re still assessing the feasibility of the First Lady attending.&nbsp; And our advance team arrives in Tokyo later this week.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, can you clarify one point, please?&nbsp; Just one &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; on Afghanistan.&nbsp; And I guess it&#8217;s off of Kelly&#8217;s question.&nbsp; But you said that you all met many times and there was a decision process in drawing down the &#8212; our presence in Afghanistan.&nbsp; Yes?&nbsp; That&#8217;s the &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; That we met many times?<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I&#8217;m not sure what you mean by that.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, that &#8212; well, you have discussed this; there is a plan in place.&nbsp; So, the question naturally is whether or not, at the end of the day, you&#8217;re accepting the fact or the possibility that the Taliban could indeed take over Afghanistan?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, Brian, I, again, will refer you to intelligence assessments and the fact that the President asked for a cleared-eye assessment &#8212; a clear-eyed assessment at the beginning of this process.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; And what I can convey to you clearly is why he made the decision.&nbsp; That&#8217;s also what he&#8217;ll be delivering an entire speech on &#8212;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; &#8212; just this afternoon.&nbsp;<br><br>Okay, we got to go on.&nbsp; Go ahead, Mike.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, Afghanistan.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You and I and a lot of the people in this room will remember early 2009, when the Vice President, you know, expressed his &#8212; his opposition to the way that that war was being conducted and his efforts to try to pull back then.&nbsp; He largely hasn&#8217;t changed his position over the time &#8212; if anything, gotten more opposed to it.<br><br>I guess, at the end of the day, does the President think this war was worth it?&nbsp; And will he tell the American people that today, whether he &#8212; what he thinks about the worth of having conducted this two-decade war?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I think what you can hear &#8212; what you&#8217;ll hear the President talk about today is one, of course, that he is proud of the men and women who served, and he is grateful to the sacrifices that have been made over the last 20 years.<br><br>He will also reiterate, as I&#8217;ve talked about a little bit, the fact that he believes the United States did what we went to Afghanistan to do: get the terrorists attacked &#8212; who attacked us on 9/11, deliver justice to Osama bin Laden, root out the terrorist threat so that Afghanistan can never be used as a base from which to attack the United States and our allies.<br><br>And he also will talk about what he&#8217;s done &#8212; what we&#8217;ve done, as a country, to help prepare and assist and provide security assistance and humanitarian assistance to the military in Afghanistan, but also to the people of Afghanistan.&nbsp;<br><br>But we&#8217;ll &#8212; what you&#8217;ll also hear him say &#8212; which I think is important for the American people to hear &#8212; is that there would have been significant consequences had we chosen not to bring our troops home.&nbsp;<br><br>In April, if he had instead announced that the U.S. &#8212; the United States was going back on this agreement made &#8212; the U.S. and allied forces remaining in Afghanistan for the foreseeable future &#8212; the Taliban would have begun to target our forces.&nbsp; The status quo was not an option.&nbsp; Those are difficult decisions you make as Commander-in-Chief.&nbsp;<br><br>So, you are right.&nbsp; His view has been, for a decade or more consistently, that he does not feel this is a military &#8212; a war that can be won militarily.&nbsp;<br><br>He does still believe and support the people of Afghanistan, the future of the government of Afghanistan.&nbsp; He supports a political process &#8212; something that our ambassador is continuing to engage in.&nbsp; And he will continue to provide and advocate for providing &#8212; and he could make this decision as President &#8212; humanitarian and security assistance to the people there.&nbsp;<br><br>So it&#8217;s &#8212; this is not a speech that is going to give a grade.&nbsp; This is a speech that&#8217;s going to explain clearly to the American people why he made the decision, what the consequences would have been, what assistance we&#8217;re going to continue to provide, how we&#8217;re going to help the brave interpreters and translators who served alongside our forces, and also what the counterterrorism factors are here, including the changing threat from Afghanistan, but including the need to take our CT resources &#8212; counterterrorism resources &#8212; and put them in parts of the world where we have the largest threat.&nbsp;<br><br>That is no longer Afghanistan.&nbsp; That is other parts of the world, whether it is, Syria, Yemen, Somalia, North Africa.&nbsp; That is where al Qaeda and ISIS is greater, and that&#8217;s where, as Commander-in-Chief, he needs to put our resources.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But &#8212; but fair to say he &#8212; fair to say that he thinks this should have been done a decade ago?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I think his view has &#8212; is well publicly known.&nbsp; But again, he has made the decision because he is now President and he assessed what is in our national security interests.&nbsp;<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah, shifting gears to a different topic: A USA Today investigation published yesterday revealed that the FBI played a role in locating Princess Latifa of Dubai just before a yacht was raided in the Indian Ocean in 2018.&nbsp; The capture of the princess has outraged human rights activists, given the accounts that she was trying to flee her father&#8217;s oppressive rule.&nbsp;<br><br>Two questions: Was the FBI assistance appropriate?&nbsp; And does it raise concerns that the assistance, even if provided unwittingly, forced Latifa&#8217;s return to the family she sought to flee?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I understand your question.&nbsp; I&#8217;m certainly &#8212; I&#8217;m just not going to have anything to offer you from here, so I&#8217;d refer you to the FBI.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And one other question.&nbsp; Multiple media outlets, including Politico and ABC, reported yesterday that the White House is seeking to have bi- &#8212; have the bipartisan infrastructure plan on the Senate floor as early as next week.&nbsp; Can you confirm that timeline as being the one sought by the White House right now?&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; Well, as Leader Schumer has said, he wants to move on both the bipartisan plan and the budget reconciliation resolution &#8212; or we&#8217;re now calling the Build Back Better plan &#8212; during the upcoming July/August Senate session.&nbsp;<br><br>So our understanding is that the process could begin as early as the week of July 19th, given that committees are still finalizing legislative text for both the budget resolution and the bipartisan bill.&nbsp; We, of course, support and would like to see it move forward as quickly as possible, but it would be a mistake to think of July 19th as anything more than the opening of a window, not a deadline.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; Two questions.&nbsp; One, Al Sharpton said earlier this morning that he and other civil rights leaders would press President Biden to do more than just put boots on the ground for voting rights &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Mm-hmm.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; that he’d pushed for a legislative solution and one that works through or around the filibuster.&nbsp; What does the President plan to say in response?&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well &#8212; well, we&#8217;ll wait for the meeting to take place and then they&#8217;ll come out to the stakeout.&nbsp;<br><br>But I will tell you the President agrees that a federal legislation is an important part of protecting voting rights and people&#8217;s right to vote, which is a fundamental right in this country.&nbsp; He agrees with that.&nbsp;<br><br>He also believes there&#8217;s a range of levers that can be used from the federal government concurrently and that he&#8217;s not going to wait either, even as federal legislation &#8212; even as we&#8217;re determining what the path forward looks like.&nbsp; But we&#8217;ll see how the meeting goes, and certainly that will be the &#8212; a central topic.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One more question.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does the White House wonder that &#8212; worry that elevating voting rights to a Democratic issue &#8212; a Democratic platform issue will give Republicans more fodder to make partisan attacks against voting rights?&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; No.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I could piggyback off Michael’s question.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the benefit of hindsight, does the President feel that the war with Afghanistan was worth it?&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Again, I think it&#8217;s important for people to know &#8212; understand that as President of the United States, he&#8217;s not here to give grades.&nbsp; He&#8217;s here to provide context to the American people on why he made the decision he made to bring men and women home from serving; why it&#8217;s in our national interest, our counterterrorism interest, and the interest of our &#8212; of our positions around the world.&nbsp;<br><br>I understand why you all are asking the question, but I think this issue, the complexity of this issue over 20 years deserves more context than that.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And one quick follow-up.&nbsp; Will there or are there consequences for the Taliban in terms of just the encroachments that they have been making in the country?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Consequences from the United States?&nbsp; Well, I would say that right now what we&#8217;re supporting is a political process and one where we are hopeful that that can move forward to have a more lasting solution and bring peace and prosperity to the country over the long term.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so that means engaging with the Taliban as sort of (inaudible)?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, as you know, we have an ambassador who is engaging &#8212; or playing a role in these negotiations.&nbsp; Ultimately, it&#8217;s, of course, between the Afghans and members of the Taliban, but we are engaged and supportive of those political &#8212; that political process.<br><br>Go ahead.&nbsp; Oh, go ahead, Nancy.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, thanks.&nbsp; Shortly after the company DiDi was listed on the New York Stock Exchange, China blocked the app, resulting in it plummeting in value and American investors losing money.&nbsp; Does this concern the President?&nbsp; And more broadly, does the President agree that regulators should block companies that do not adhere to U.S. auditing regulations from IPOs?&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I&#8217;m not going to speak &#8212; comment on this specific company from here or speak to actions that could be taken independently by the SEC.&nbsp;<br><br>Broadly, the U.S. will continue to ensure we remain the destination of choice for investors and companies seeking investments around the world, and always protecting Americans’ data and our national security.&nbsp;<br><br>We do think it&#8217;s essential that all companies that list in the U.S. adhere to high standards of transparency and disclosure, and welcome companies that meet those standards.&nbsp;<br><br>But beyond that, I&#8217;m not going to have additional &#8212;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just one more question, Jen.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah, go ahead.&nbsp; Go ahead, Nancy.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On COVID: When will the White House make a decision on reopening travel to certain nations?&nbsp; And what will it be based on?&nbsp; Will it be based on vaccine thresholds, or is there a certain country that you want to open travel to first?&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, as you know, Nancy, there are working groups that are currently engaged and in touch about the criteria that will need to be met in order to reopen.&nbsp; We certainly understand and know that this is a point of frustration for a lot of people around the world, including people who are separated from their family members.&nbsp; And we put these working groups together so they could work together directly to assess what the criteria should be on when the travel can be reopened.&nbsp;<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the United States now recognizing Claude Joseph as the leader of Haiti?&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We recognize the democratic institutions of Haiti, and we are going to continue to work with them directly.&nbsp; But we have long call- &#8212; we have been calling for elections this year, and we support those proceeding.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you think that those elections should be delayed from September?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We believe they should proceed this year.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Has the President reached out to the interim prime minister?&nbsp; Has he reached out or does he plan to reach out?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have any calls that &#8212; he has not reached out.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have any calls to preview for you, no.&nbsp;<br><br>Go ahead.&nbsp; Go ahead, Rachel.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The President’s reference to door-to-door campaigns for vaccines sparked kind of a backlash.&nbsp; You know, Missouri’s governor is saying he doesn&#8217;t want that.&nbsp; The Republican lawmakers saying, basically, “Stay off our lawns.”&nbsp; Can you say who is doing the door knocking and where?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; Well, let me first say that this has been ongoing since April, and the best people to talk about vaccinations are local, trusted messengers: doctors, faith leaders, community leaders &#8212;<br><br>Do you have something, April, you want to share with the group?&nbsp; (Laughs.)&nbsp; Okay.<br><br>So, those are the people who are the trusted messengers around the country.&nbsp; And we believe that we need to empower these individuals to continue to work in communities to make sure people know that these vaccines are safe, that they can save lives.&nbsp; And so these are grassroots voices across the country.&nbsp;<br><br>They are not members of the government.&nbsp; They are not federal government employees.&nbsp; They are volunteers.&nbsp; They are clergy.&nbsp; They are trusted voices in communities who are playing this role and door knocking.&nbsp;<br><br>And this is one of the tactics that we&#8217;ve used over the last couple of months, but we&#8217;ve seen &#8212; so, it&#8217;s not the only factor &#8212; but I would say that we&#8217;ve seen, in some states &#8212; Alabama: the adult vaccination rate increased by 3.9 percent; 149,000 additional adults got their first dose in June.</p>



<p>In Florida, the adult vaccination rate increased by 4.4 &#8212; 4.4 percent.&nbsp; In Georgia, the adult vaccination rate increased by 3.5 percent.&nbsp;<br><br>So, in our view, this is a &#8212; this is a way to engage and empower local activists, trusted members of the community.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, the follow-up would be: Is it working? &nbsp;And who are &#8212; who are these volunteers reaching other than, say, shut-ins?&nbsp; Because people don&#8217;t even have to get off their couches to see who&#8217;s at their door these days.&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, that&#8217;s fair &#8212; depending on the technology in your house, I guess, I suppose.&nbsp; But I think what&#8217;s important for people to know &#8212; and I appreciate you asking the question &#8212; is that the federal government does not have a database of who&#8217;s been vaccinated.&nbsp; That is not our role.&nbsp; We don&#8217;t maintain a database along those lines, and we have no plans to.<br><br>We do know where there are rates of vaccination across the country, and we know &#8212; as I just listed in some of the data &#8212; that there are tactics that are powerful and impactful.&nbsp;<br><br>And so, I will say, the thing that is a bit frustrating to us is that when &#8212; when people are critical of these tactics, it&#8217;s really a disservice to the country and to the doctors, faith leaders, community leaders, and others who are working to get people vaccinated.&nbsp; This is about saving lives and ending this pandemic.&nbsp;<br><br>Go ahead.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was that me?&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Oh, go ahead, Yamiche.&nbsp; Yeah, go ahead.&nbsp; I’m sorry.&nbsp; And then I’ll go to you, right in front of her.&nbsp; Go ahead, Yamiche.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So my &#8212; I have two questions.&nbsp; The first is: You’ve said over and over again that the United States believes elections should happen in Haiti this year.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People in Haiti are so scared they can&#8217;t leave their homes; they can&#8217;t go to the grocery store.&nbsp; How does the United States think elections can happen when people are too afraid to even go to their front doors?&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, Yamiche, first, we understand and see the trauma that obviously the horrific killing of just thirty- &#8212;<br><br>&nbsp;Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It’s happening for months.&nbsp; So, yes?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I understand that.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t say anything otherwise.&nbsp; But I&#8217;m saying what&#8217;s happened over the last 36 hours.&nbsp; We, again, stand ready to provide support, provide assistance in any way that is formally requested by the government there.&nbsp;<br><br>We&#8217;re &#8212; we’re looking forward to hearing from them on what they would request and how we can help them through this period of time.&nbsp; And we called for an election this year &#8212; or we&#8217;re continuing to call for one because we feel that supporting democratic institutions, the democratic process, is something that would be in the interest of the people of Haiti.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re advocating for it.&nbsp;<br><br>We stand by to provide assistance, to provide help in any way possible, as we long have, even before yesterday.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the people of Haiti, including human rights activists, clergy members on the ground, they&#8217;ve been saying over and over again for months now that elections aren&#8217;t possible.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve talked to people specifically who say that they&#8217;re disappointed in the President’s stance on Haiti, that they see him as continuing failed policies that go back to his predecessor, former President Trump.&nbsp;<br><br>What&#8217;s the President&#8217;s response to Haitians who say they are disappointed in him and they don&#8217;t think that he&#8217;s really listening to their cries, which are saying that elections cannot happen?&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I would say that the message to the people of Haiti is: We stand with you.&nbsp; We want to provide assistance, whether that is assistance requested by the government or assistance that is needed for the people of the country to prosper in the future.&nbsp; And that is the President&#8217;s view.&nbsp;<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the President &#8212;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Go ahead.&nbsp; We&#8217;re going to have to keep going.&nbsp; Go ahead.&nbsp; Go ahead.&nbsp; Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah, right now, on Haiti &#8212; right now &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Oh, I&#8217;m sorry.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll come back to you, I apologize.&nbsp; Go ahead.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah, right now there are two politicians who are claiming, in Haiti, the role of prime minister: Claude Joseph and Ariel Henry.&nbsp; How does the U.S. think that this impasse should be resolved?&nbsp; And are you worried that it could lead to further instability?&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, first, we continue to support Haiti&#8217;s democratic institutions.&nbsp; And we have been in touch with the acting prime minister, and we echo his call for calm.&nbsp; But I would again reiterate that&#8217;s one of the reasons we have called for elections this year, and we believe that they should proceed.&nbsp;<br><br>Of course, we are worried about and closely monitoring the security situation, the stability in Haiti, and understand that &#8212; even before yesterday, but certainly as a result of yesterday &#8212; that is even more of a concern for the people who are living in the country.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But right now, you are not backing any one of the two?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We are calling &#8212; we support the institutions, and we are continuing to call for elections this year.<br><br>Go ahead, Monica.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, on voting rights: The President indicated he may tour the nation and talk about that, give a major speech on the topic.&nbsp; That hasn&#8217;t happened yet.&nbsp; Should we expect it still to take place?&nbsp; Or what can you tell us about that?&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; Well, I would say, first, that the President felt it was important to meet directly with civil rights leaders and talk to them about how we can work together to continue to push for federal legislation, continue to use every lever in the federal government to make voting more accessible across the country.&nbsp;But certainly, he conveyed he wants to speak to the country about voting rights and how he&#8217;s going to address it moving forward.<br><br>I don&#8217;t have any scheduling updates for you today, but he certainly plans to continue &#8212; continues to plan to do that, I should say.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That’s still the plan.&nbsp; Okay.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yep.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Oh, I’m sorry.&nbsp; Go ahead, go ahead.&nbsp; I apologize.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; There are hurt feelings among government officials in Taipei after the White House COVID team posted and then deleted a tweet that had an image of Taiwan&#8217;s flag along those of other nations getting vaccine doses from the United States.&nbsp; Was this tweet a mistake in the first place?&nbsp; And if not, then why was the tweet deleted?&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; So, this was an honest mistake that was made by the team handling graphics and social media, and should not in any way be viewed as a shift in official U.S. policy.&nbsp; When we recognized the mistake, we removed the tweet.&nbsp; So we did exactly as you said.<br><br>We remain committed to our One-China Policy based on the Taiwan Relations Act, the three joint communiqués, and the six assurances.<br><br>Go ahead, in the middle.&nbsp; Go ahead, Eugene.&nbsp; Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; It seems pretty clear on &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; And you just got engaged, I think.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I did.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Random aside.&nbsp; But congratulations.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; We’re just a lot of news you can use in here.&nbsp; (Laughter.)<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It seems pretty clear that, on voting rights, a legislative fix isn&#8217;t going to happen, right?&nbsp; Like, the Republicans have made it clear they&#8217;re probably not going to get on board; you&#8217;re not going to get 10 votes.&nbsp; And the President has talked about being open to filibuster reform if it&#8217;s used, kind of, too much.&nbsp; And, I guess, advocates keep asking us to ask you guys: What does that look like?&nbsp; Is there a time period?&nbsp; Because we&#8217;re &#8212; they feel like they&#8217;re running out of time, that they&#8217;re not seeing a lot of urgency on the President’s part.&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would say the President is meeting with civil rights leaders today because he feels there is urgency on determining how we can most effectively work together to move voting rights forward &#8212; access to voting rights, I guess I should say, forward.&nbsp;<br><br>And he&#8217;s an optimist by nature; otherwise, he wouldn&#8217;t be President of the United States.&nbsp; So he continues to believe that there should be a pathway forward for federal legislation.&nbsp; He did say, as you just quoted, he has made comments in that regard.&nbsp; And certainly obstruction and the fact that there is an unwillingness to move forward in making voting more accessible to people across the country is something that he&#8217;s mindful of and he believes and has said &#8212; and we have said before &#8212; could change the conversation in the Senate.&nbsp;<br><br>We&#8217;ll see what happens, but he will continue to press for federal legislation moving forward.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Inaudible) one more.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Oh, yeah, go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I’ve talked to Reverend Sharpton quite a bit, and one thing that he is really interested in seeing and hearing from the President is a carve-out for voting rights and police reform for the filibuster.&nbsp; Is that something that the White House is going to be pushing for?&nbsp; Is the President calling Joe Manchin and other holdouts on filibuster reform?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; The President&#8217;s position hasn&#8217;t changed.&nbsp; We certainly understand the position of Reverend Sharpton and others.&nbsp; And the President, though, shares their desire, commitment, interest in moving forward on voting rights legislation and moving forward on initiatives across the country that can help make voting more accessible to people across the country.&nbsp; I&#8217;m sure they will have a robust discussion today.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a question about the executive order &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; on non-compete mandates.&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yep.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Businesses use those mandates because it helps protect their investment in employees; it also helps protect their intellectual property.&nbsp; So will there be any kind of carve-out or anything in this executive order to protect businesses?&nbsp; And what is the White House message to businesses that are concerned about this executive order?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I&#8217;m happy to follow up with our team and see if there&#8217;s anything specifically to your very good question.&nbsp;<br><br>I will say that the overarching objective with the executive order is to make sure the President is encouraging competition in industries around the country.&nbsp; It doesn&#8217;t sound right to most people that there are three shipping companies that are dominating the market, and upping and increasing costs for suppliers, small businesses, people across the country.&nbsp; That doesn&#8217;t sound right or fair, because it isn&#8217;t.&nbsp; So that&#8217;s what the President is trying to address.<br><br>In terms of the specific carve-out you&#8217;re asking about, I&#8217;m happy to ask our team if there&#8217;s anything more.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.&nbsp; Just on voting rights: Vice President Harris, as we speak, is announcing a $25 million expansion of the DNC’s &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yep.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; “I Will Vote” initiative.&nbsp; This is just one of the examples that voter &#8212; that Democratic committees are launching in terms of voter protection.&nbsp; Can you speak about the White House&#8217;s collaboration with these committees on the strategy?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, again, I referred specifically to the DNC because it&#8217;s most appropriate for them.&nbsp; I know the Vice President is making this speech to &#8212; but to outline the specific details given they’re the political arm here, so they can get into all the specific details.<br><br>But it&#8217;s just an example of how every lever of the Democratic Party and the federal government is working and looking for ways that we can make voting more accessible around the country.&nbsp; But they&#8217;d be the most appropriate entity to outline details.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But is the White House specifically involved?&nbsp; Were they aware of this strategy?&nbsp; I mean, what was the collaboration between the two?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yes, we&#8217;re aware of it.&nbsp; But again, they&#8217;re the political arm, so they&#8217;re the most appropriate body to outline details.<br><br>Go ahead.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, Jen.&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; I wanted to ask you about the global tax negotiations.&nbsp; I know that Secretary Yellen is supposed to be in Italy tomorrow about it.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Mm-hmm.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can the White House credibly guarantee to its counterparties in that agreement that you can get something through the Senate and the U.S. will actually be able to enact the legislation that the deal requires?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, that&#8217;s something we&#8217;ve proposed and we&#8217;re going to continue to press on.&nbsp; And this agreement wouldn&#8217;t be the case &#8212; wouldn&#8217;t be happening without the leadership of the United States, of Secretary Yellen and others in the government.&nbsp; So certainly, it is very much our desire, our interest, and our commitment to deliver on that promise.&nbsp;<br><br>I think you&#8217;re going to have to gather in a moment here.&nbsp; Go ahead.&nbsp; One more.&nbsp; One more.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.&nbsp; You may have seen yesterday the former President filed a class-action lawsuit against three social media companies, and one of the targets as part of that lawsuit is Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.&nbsp; He would like to see that particular aspect of the law ruled unconstitutional.<br><br>In January of last year, Joe Biden, when he was running for President, spoke to the New York Times, and he said Section 230 should be revoked &#8212; revoked immediately.&nbsp; Does he stand by the comments that he made to the New York Times last year?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I have not spoken with him about Section 230.&nbsp; I remember those comments, and I remember the New York Times article.&nbsp; I&#8217;m happy to venture to do exactly that.&nbsp;<br><br>I will say that, as it relates to these lawsuits, it&#8217;s certainly a decision for the platforms to make.&nbsp; I think it&#8217;s safe to say that the President spends a lot less time obsessing over social media than the former President.&nbsp;<br><br>With that, thank you, everyone.&nbsp; Happy birthday, Steve!<br><br>1:29 P.M.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>Today, despite the fact that rural and Tribal communities across the country are asset-rich, they make up a disproportionate number of persistent poverty communities. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework invests in rural and Tribal communities, creating jobs in rural America and wealth that stays in rural America. The Framework delivers 100% broadband coverage, rebuilds crumbling infrastructure like roads and bridges, eliminates lead pipes and service lines, builds resilience to climate change and extreme weather events, and puts Americans to work cleaning up pollution that has impacted fossil fuel communities in rural America.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to being the largest-long term investment in our infrastructure in nearly a century – four times the infrastructure investment in the 2009 Recovery Act – the Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework is a generational investment in rural America.</p>



<p>Investments in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework to strengthen and create jobs in rural communities include:</p>



<p><strong>Provide high speed internet to every home. </strong>More than 35 percent of rural Americans and Tribal communities lack wired access to broadband at acceptable speeds. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Frameworkinvests $65 billion, including through USDA rural broadband programs, to make high-speed internet available to all Americans, bring down high-speed internet prices across the board, and provide technical assistance to communities seeking to expand broadband. With the 1936 Rural Electrification Act, the Federal government made a historic investment in bringing electricity to nearly every home and farm in America, and millions of families and our economy reaped the benefits. Broadband internet is the new electricity. It is necessary for Americans to do their jobs, to accelerate precision agriculture, to participate equally in school learning and health care, and to stay connected.<br><br><strong>Ensure clean drinking water in every home. </strong>Across the country, including in rural and Tribal communities, pipes and treatment plants are aging and polluted drinking water endanger public health. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework invests $55 billion in clean drinking water. It will replace 100 percent of the nation’s lead pipes and service lines, benefiting up to 10 million American households and 400,000 schools and child care centers. The Framework invests in water infrastructure across America, including in Tribal Nations and disadvantaged communities that need it most.</p>



<p><strong>Fix Rural Roads and Bridges. </strong>As part of a $110 billion investment to repair America’s crumbling infrastructure, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework invests in fixing 10,000 off-system bridges, many in rural areas, that provide critical linkages for communities to economic opportunity.</p>



<p><strong>Build Drought, Fire and Flood Resilience. </strong>Last year, the United States faced 22 extreme weather and climate-related disaster events with losses over $1 billion – a cumulative price tag of nearly $100 billion. These included damaging floods, fires, and wind storms across rural America. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework invests $52 billion to help communities build resilience to wildfires and floods through investments in forest management and upgrades to critical infrastructure &#8212; such as elevating buildings, roads, and bridges, hardening physical infrastructure, and winterizing the power grid. And, it will fund state and local infrastructure improvements and emergency response strategies, such as planning grants to support the development of evacuation routes or upgrades community shelters.</p>



<p>The Framework also helps Western farmers, ranchers, Tribes, families, and communities better prepare for future droughts. It invests in ecosystem restoration, such as the restoration of wetlands that can reduce flood risk for communities.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Plug Orphan Wells, Clean Up Abandoned Mines, and Remediate Idle Rural Property. </strong>In rural and Tribal communities around the country, former industrial and energy sites are now idle and sources of blight and pollution. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework provides the full American Jobs Plan funding level &#8212; $21 billion – to create good-paying union jobs plugging orphan oil and gas wells, cleaning up abandoned mines, and remediating Brownfield and Superfund sites in rural areas and on Tribal lands. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework will create jobs and build wealth in communities across the country that powered our economic growth for decades and have been affected most by the impacts of climate change and pollution, including rural communities and communities of color.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Connect Rural Communities Through Rail. </strong>U.S. passenger rail lags behind the rest of the world in reliability, speed, and coverage. China already has 22,000 miles of high-speed rail, and is planning to double that by 2035. The lack of rail options affects rural communities in particular. This the largest investment in passenger rail since the creation of Amtrak 50 years ago. The Framework invests $66 billion in passenger and freight rail, including to bring world-class rail service to areas outside the northeast and mid-Atlantic.</p>



<p><strong>Build and Upgrade Airports, Ports, and Waterways in Rural America. </strong>While the United States pioneered the modern aviation industry, today, U.S. airports lag far behind and many rural airports need repair.&nbsp; Only 9 percent of roads outside ports are in good or very good condition and the American Society of Civil Engineers gives America’s Inland Waterways infrastructure a D+. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework meets this challenge by investing $16.3 billion in port infrastructure and $25 billion in airports to address repair and maintenance backlogs, reduce congestion and emissions near ports and airports, and drive electrification and other low-carbon technologies. Modern, resilient, and sustainable port, airport, and freight infrastructure will help American farmers and ranchers sell their goods around the nation and world by removing bottlenecks and expediting commerce and reduce the environmental impact on neighboring communities.</p>



<p><strong>Build Electric Transmission Infrastructure in Rural America. </strong>Power outages cost the U.S. economy up to $70 billion annually. For example, the recent Texas power outages caused estimated losses of up to $90 billion for the state. At times, rural communities can be without power for days during these outages. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework meets this challenge by making the single largest investment in transmission in American history.&nbsp; It creates a Grid Development Authority at the Department of Energy to enable a national, clean energy power grid and funds to support activities that reduce the impacts to the electric grid and communities from extreme weather, wildfire, and natural disasters. It deploys long distance, high voltage transmission to enhance reliability and resilience, lower costs, and integrate the highest value clean energy resources. It invests in research and development for advanced transmission and electricity distribution technologies, and smart grid technologies that deliver flexibility and resilience. And, it invests more than $22 billion in demonstration projects and research hubs for next generation technologies like advanced nuclear reactors, carbon capture for industrial plants, and green hydrogen.</p>

<p>Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, within 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President publishes in the <em>Federal Register</em> and transmits to the Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the anniversary date.&nbsp; In accordance with this provision, I have sent to the <em>Federal Register</em> for publication the enclosed notice stating that the national emergency with respect to significant transnational criminal organizations declared in Executive Order 13581 of July&nbsp;24, 2011, under which additional steps were taken in Executive Order 13863 of March 15, 2019, is to continue in effect beyond July 24, 2021.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The activities of significant transnational criminal organizations have reached such scope and gravity that they threaten the stability of international political and economic systems.&nbsp; Such organizations are becoming increasingly sophisticated and dangerous to the United States; they are increasingly entrenched in the operations of foreign governments and the international financial system, thereby weakening democratic institutions, degrading the rule of law, and undermining economic markets.&nbsp; These organizations facilitate and aggravate violent civil conflicts and increasingly facilitate the activities of other dangerous persons.</p>



<p>The activities of significant transnational criminal organizations continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.  For these reasons, I have determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency with respect to significant transnational criminal organizations declared in Executive Order 13581, under which additional steps were taken in Executive Order 13863.</p>

<p>On July 24, 2011, by Executive Order 13581, the President declared a national emergency with respect to transnational criminal organizations pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 <em>et seq</em>.) to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States constituted by the activities of significant transnational criminal organizations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On March 15, 2019, by Executive Order 13863, the President took additional steps to deal with the national emergency with respect to significant transnational criminal organizations in view of the evolution of these organizations as well as the increasing sophistication of their activities, which threaten international political and economic systems and pose a direct threat to the safety and welfare of the United States and its citizens, and given the ability of these organizations to derive revenue through widespread illegal conduct, including acts of violence and abuse that exhibit a wanton disregard for human life as well as many other crimes enriching and empowering these organizations.</p>



<p>The activities of significant transnational criminal organizations continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of&nbsp;the United States.&nbsp; For these reasons, the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13581 of July 24, 2011, under which additional steps were taken in Executive Order 13863 of March&nbsp;15, 2019, must continue in effect beyond July 24, 2021.&nbsp; Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1&nbsp;year the national emergency with respect to significant transnational criminal organizations declared in Executive Order 13581.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">McHenry County College<br>Crystal Lake, Illinois</p>



<p>1:46 P.M. CDT<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Edith.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.  (Applause.)  Please.  Please, be seated.<br><br>Mr. President &#8212; what he hadn’t told you today: He had to delay his vacation to be here today.  (Laughter.)  He heard Biden is coming.  He goes, “Oh, my God, when is he coming?”  (Laughter.)  But &#8212; (laughs) &#8212; so he could show me around McHenry County College.<br><br>I’m glad to be here with great Illinois leaders.  I want you all to &#8212; you know, America is back.  America is back.  (Applause.)  And in no small part because of the men and women that I serve with. <br><br>Governor Pritzker, stand up, man.  Stand up.  (Applause.)  This is a good man. <br><br>If you really want someone in a foxhole with you when you’re in trouble, you want Senator Tammy Duckworth.  Tammy.  (Applause.)<br><br>And the guy I rely on more than anyone else in the United States Senate &#8212; and I’ve served with him for years; we have a lot in common in terms of losses as well as gains &#8212; is Dick Durbin.  Dick.  (Applause.)<br><br>And Congresswoman Underwood, who got me a passport to her town.  (Applause.)  Her mom and dad are mildly proud with good reason.  (Laughter.)  Good reason.  Actually, her mom looks like her sister.  (Laughter.) <br><br>Last week, I was up in Wisconsin to talk about a bipartisan agreement to modernize American infrastructure and, in the process, create millions of good-paying jobs.  That’s not my estimate &#8212; that’s Wall Street estimates; that’s everybody’s estimate.  Millions of good-paying jobs.  Not $7, not $8, not $10, not even $15 an hour.  Good prevailing-wage jobs.  (Applause.)<br><br>And here’s what it means for Illinois: You’ve got, like many states &#8212; all states &#8212; you’ve got 230- &#8212; 2,374 bridges and over 6,200 miles of highway that are in disrepair.<br><br>As a result, every driver in this state pays a hidden tax<br>of about $600 per year in wasted time and wasted fuel because of the nature of the roads and bridges &#8212; and, by the way, you’re better than a lot of states &#8212; not to mention the challenge of getting to work or getting to the daycare center on time to avoid that late fee when you pick up your child.<br><br>Your governor has an ambitious infrastructure plan, and under a bipartisan infrastructure agreement, we’re going to make the biggest investment in roads and bridges since the construction of the Interstate Highway System, literally creating millions of good-paying jobs.  (Applause.)<br><br>And God willing, we’re not going to have 40 &#8212; 40 weeks of “This is Infrastructure Week.”  (Laughter.)  Remember those?<br><br>Think what it will mean to McHenry’s entrepreneurial agricultural program if we can get products more easily to Chicago.  Think about how much easier life will be when it’s quicker to drive on Randall Road.  (Laughter.)<br><br>Look, this agreement also allows us to replace every lead pipe and service line in America, benefitting 10 million homes.  (Applause.)  It’s going to address &#8212; it’s going to address lead exposure to 400,000 of our schools and daycare facilities where children drink that water.  This would be the largest investment in clean drinking water in American history when we pass it.<br><br>In every &#8212; 1 in every 10 people in Illinois lacks access to high-speed Internet.  The bipartisan agreement that Dick and others have made sure we’re getting &#8212; the agreement allows us to connect every American to reliable, high-speed, affordable Internet &#8212; every single American, rural and urban.  And, by the way, those of you who are parents, who had kids at home, tell me what Internet means this last year.  (Laughter.)  If they’re school age.  <br><br>Well, from 2010 to 2020, Illinois experienced 49 extreme weather events &#8212; although I heard today from the senator north of here that there &#8212; a Republican senator &#8212; there is no global warming.  Just so you know, there’s no such thing.  (Laughter.) <br><br>But those weather events cost this state roughly $50 billion in damages.  And we’re going to up upgrade the electric grid to make it more resilient to extreme weather and other threats.<br><br>There’s a lot more the agreement is going to do to encourage the physical and ensure &#8212; the physical infrastructure lays the foundation for a strong, durable, and sustainable competitive economy.<br><br>But what I want to talk to you about today is human infrastructure.  It’s essential to that foundation, as well.  To truly win the 21st century and once again lead the world, to truly build an economy from the bottom up and the middle out, to truly deal everybody in this time, we need to invest in our people.  We need to invest in our people.<br><br>That’s why, in addition to the bipartisan infrastructure agreement that I believe we’re going to get done, I’m here to make the case for the second critical part of my domestic agenda.  It’s a combination of parts of my American Jobs Plan that were essential and not included in the bipartisan infrastructure plan, as well as my American Families Plan. <br><br>In Washington, they call it a “reconciliation bill.”  That’s a fancy way of saying, with a filibuster that our friends on the other side use constantly &#8212; more than ever been used in history &#8212; it means you got to get 60 votes to get anything done.  We’re 50-50 Senate with a Vice President who happens to be a Democrat.<br><br>And back in the campaign, you know, I said we’re going to build back, and we’re going to build back better.  Not just &#8212; we can’t just build back; we got to build back better.<br><br>And today, I want to outline some of the key pieces of this Build Back Better agenda and what’s it going to do for the people of Illinois and the people of the United States.<br><br>It’s about a country, once again, that inspires and leads the world with the opportunities we provide, the cures we discovery, the technolog- &#8212; that we discover &#8212; the technologies we pioneer, and industries we create.  You know, and a nation that leads the world in combatting the existential threat of climate change.<br><br>The Build Back Better plan &#8212; agenda starts with education.  You know, one of the reasons why we were the leading country in the world for so long, and still on the edge, is because we’re the first nation &#8212; industrial nation in the world to require &#8212; to allow 12 years of free education back at the turn of the 20th century.  But everybody is caught up.<br><br>At the time, they were debating what should be education in America.  The argument was there should be 12 years of free education.  And that’s what’s got us ahead.  That’s what had us leap ahead of the rest of the world.<br><br>But as (inaudible) today, everybody is caught up.  Does anybody think, in the 21st century, with the change that’s taking place in technology and across the board, that 12 years of education is enough to be able to live a middle-class life?  I don’t think so.<br><br>And so, the fact of the matter is we’ve decided &#8212; I’ve decided we should have a minimum of 14 years of education.  Fourteen years of education &#8212; which I’ll explain in a second.<br><br>You know, as the First Lady &#8212; I’m Jill Biden’s husband, but &#8212; (laughter) &#8212; but as Jill would say &#8212; and she’s a full-time community college professor while being the First Lady &#8212; she often says, &#8220;Any nation that out-educates us is going to out-compete us.&#8221;  Any nation that out-educates us is going to out compete us. <br><br>That’s why I want to guarantee an additional four additional years of public education for every person in America, starting with providing two years of universal, high-quality preschool for three- and four-year-olds, building &#8212; (applause) &#8212; building on what the governor has been doing here in Illinois.  (Applause.)<br><br>In the last 10 years, studies out of the great universities &#8212; study of a high-quality program here in Chicago &#8212; found that low-income children participating in preschool were 47 percent more likely to earn an associate’s degree or higher, and get through school without any difficulty.  We have to build on that foundation for future success.  And then I want to add two years of free community college for everyone.  (Applause.) <br><br>And we can afford it.  I’ll tell you how. <br><br>That can boost the earnings of a high school graduate with low-wage jobs by nearly $6,000 a year on average.<br><br>The average annual cost of a two-year degree in Illinois is $4,200.  Under my proposal, that cost would be zero.  (Applause.)<br><br>But it’s not just tuition that’s expensive; as was pointed out, living expenses, housing, meals, transportation.  And that’s why I propose to increase a maximum Pell Grant &#8212; which, if you are below a certain income, you qualify for a Pell Grant &#8212; from about $6,500 to $8,000 a year.  (Applause.)  And that will fill it out. <br><br>I know &#8212; I know that here at McHenry, you have a dual enrollment program so students from places like Woodstock High School and other high schools, you get credit for taking college classes here.  Well, my plan will &#8212; will provide resources to expand programs like the one you have here.<br><br>My plan will also do more to invest in high-quality job training and apprenticeships in fast-growing sectors like public health, childcare, manufacturing, information technology, clean energy so that all Americans can get the skills that employers want that lead to good middle-class and &#8212; I was &#8212; I make no apology &#8212; union jobs.  (Applause.)<br><br>It would also &#8212; it would also make strategic investments in teachers &#8212; in the teacher pipeline.  Because even before the pandemic, our school system was 100,000 teachers short here in America, particularly in high-demand areas.<br><br>Our children are the kite strings that lift our national ambitions aloft, and our teachers are the ones that help them<br>believe they can do anything.  I bet every one of your success can name the teacher that helped change your life.  I bet every one &#8212; every one of us.  There’s somebody who came along and made us believe in ourselves.  That’s the really sec- &#8212; the secret of teachers.<br><br>My plan will reduce student debt for future teachers, double the size of the annual federal scholarships for future teachers.<br><br>We’ll also support $100 billion in school infrastructure improvements, including community college, to make sure that they are safe and healthy places for learning, and that all students &#8212; with the labs and technology they need to be able to compete in the 21st century.<br><br>Of course, an ability to take these jobs often depends on the availability of childcare.  As a single father, when I was first got to the Senate, I had two young boys who had just lost their mom and their sister in an automobile accident.  If I hadn’t had the family I have &#8212; my sister, best &#8212; my younger sister, my best friend, and my brother, and my mom help out &#8212; I couldn’t have done it.  But not everybody has that kind of support.   <br><br>I just toured your Children’s Learning Center.  It’s an amazing resource.  Students and faculty can have their children cared for.  Students can earn their associate degrees in early childhood education as well.  High-quality childcare options should be the rule, not the exception.<br><br>So, on my way in here, I met with Mike Sayre, who wrote me a letter about his struggle to find affordable childcare, and he wanted me to &#8212; he wanted to know what my plans were.  Well, Mike, I hope you know now.  Here we are.<br><br>My plan is to provide access to quality, affordable childcare with more childcare centers in community college campuses with new and upgraded childcare facilities all across the country. (Applause.)<br><br>Businesses &#8212; businesses will get a full tax credit to build on-site facilities.  And the reason they want to do that is not just to be nice.  Business &#8212; because studies show when there’s an on-site childcare center, businesses have less employee turnover, less absenteeism, and higher productivity.  It’s overwhelmingly in their interest to do it.<br><br>Middle-class families will pay no more than 7 percent of their income for high-quality childcare for children up to age five.  And the most hard-pressed working families won’t have to pay a dime.<br><br>My plan will also invest in childcare workforce with better wages, benefits, and training opportunities.<br><br>Look, we’re also going to give parents the option to take up to an $8,000 tax credit to cover childcare expenses, if that’s the preferred route.  That’s good for families and it’s good for our economy, and it will create more jobs.<br><br>My plan will also provide up to 12 weeks of paid family leave for medical &#8212; (applause) &#8212; up to 12 weeks of paid family leave.  Look, we’re one of the few major economies in the world that doesn’t cover paid family and medical leave. <br><br>And the most difficult moments some will ever face:<br>No one should have to choose between a job and a paycheck and take caring of someone you love &#8212; a parent, a spouse, a child.<br><br>Look, we will tackle the maternal mortality crisis, as well, that impacts on Black and Native American mothers disproportionately.  And what &#8212; and I want to thank Congresswoman Underwood for her leadership in this area.  (Applause.)  For real.<br><br>As I’ve said again and again, people who really need a tax break in this country are America’s working families.  It’s time they get a tax break.<br><br>So, my Build Back Better agenda would extend the expanded Child Tax Credit we passed under my American Rescue Plan.  Those of you who have children under the age of seven [six], you’re going to get &#8212; and depending on your income &#8212; your income taxes &#8212; you’re going to get a cash payment back.  Up to now, guess what?  You get $2,000 to declare a dependent.  If you have two children, you get $4,000 off a $10,000 tax bill.  It’s important.<br><br>But if you don’t have enough &#8212; you don’t have enough &#8212; you don’t make enough money to be able to have &#8212; to owe that kind of tax, you don’t get a tax credit, you don’t get anything.  Well, under this proposal, guess what?  You’re in a situation where if you have a child under the age of <s>seven</s> [six], you get back $3,600 in cash.  In addition to that, those of you who are in that situation are going to start to see that coming in by the end of this month, on a monthly basis.  It can change the lives of people. <br><br>Starting next week, families will begin to receive one of the largest-ever single-year tax cuts aimed to families with children.  And every child under age 6 is $3,600; every child between 6 and 17 is $3,000.  It’s not as a credit against your taxes, but a direct payment.  You’ll get cash.  Cash.  That’s what you’ll get.<br><br>For example, a middle-class family with two children can expect to receive $7,200.  You’ll get the first half &#8212; the $3,600 &#8212; paid out at $600 a month between July and December, and you’ll get the rest between January and Tax Day.<br><br>With this one tax cut, every study shows that childcare &#8212; childcare is cutting poverty in ha- &#8212; by 40 percent.  Families with children who qualify for this, it cuts poverty by 40 percent.<br><br>So, let’s extend the tax cut at least through 2025, and let’s expand &#8212; (applause) &#8212; let&#8217;s expand free meals for millions more children in schools, with the assistance during the summer months when they don’t have access to those school meals. <br><br>We support families with children.  We also need to provide greater dignity for our nation’s senior citizens who care for them. <br><br>Look, there are hundreds of thousands of older adults<br>and people with disabilities who need home- and community-based care services.  They qualify for it under Medicaid, but there&#8217;s a backlog of thousands of people.  But one study showed that $3,000 spent helping a senior stay in their home by providing &#8212; it saves the country more than $20,000 a year in medical costs. <br><br>At the same time, more than 1.5 million Americans work in homecare.  They&#8217;re disproportionately women, women of color, and immigrants, and those jobs are among the lowest paid in our economy.  One in six homecare workers lives in poverty.  We need to do better on both sides of the equation. <br><br>My plan expands homecare for older and disabled Americans,<br>while improving jobs and pay for homecare workers who care for them.<br><br>And here&#8217;s the deal: You save a lot of money if you don’t have to go to a home.  Keeping people in their own home, mentally and every other way, is a benefit &#8212; a significant benefit for the community, as well as cost. <br><br>We also need to continue to make healthcare more affordable.  When we lowered premiums and expanded coverage for the American Re- &#8212; in my American Rescue Plan, more than 1.5 million people signed up for what used to be called &#8220;Obamacare.&#8221;  I want to make these premium reductions permanent so we can get even more people covered.<br><br>We need to deal with the shortage of affordable housing in America.  Over 10 million renters in this country pay more than half their income for the rent on their apartment, and the lack of affordable housing prevents people from moving to communities where there are more opportunities.<br><br>So we’re going to make historic investment in affordable housing, increasing and improving the housing supply by building and rehabilitating more than 2 million homes, especially in places that need more housing.<br><br>And we need to invest not just in the physical and human infrastructure of today, we need to invest in the jobs and industries of tomorrow.<br><br>Three decades ago &#8212; and this always disturbs me, even just repeating it &#8212; three decades ago, the United States was number one in the world for a share of their GDP being invested in research and development.  We were number one in the world.  We&#8217;re now number eight [nine] in the world.  Number eight [nine] in the world.  China was number &#8212; or &#8212; excuse me, we’re &#8212; China was number nine [eight] in the world; now they’re number two in the world.<br><br>Folks, Democrats and Republicans agree we can’t afford to lose this race.  They came together in the Senate on an Innovation and Competition Act &#8212; that Dick was very much a part of &#8212; to help us grow the industries that win the jobs of the future.<br><br>We need to lay the foundation for the next generation of American jobs and American leadership in manufacturing and technology.<br><br>We&#8217;re going to invest in Historically Black Colleges and Universities and other Minority-Serving Institutions because while these schools may not have the endowments or the labs needed to generate these jobs, these students are just as capable of learning about all of the things that are going to provide the jobs of the future.  <br><br>And, of course, no challenge is as urgent as climate change.  Last week, I met with eight governors for a better part of an hour, all from the western states, Republicans and Democrats.  They’re facing extreme heat, record drought,<br>and a fire season that threatens to be much longer and more dangerous and more destructive than ever. <br><br>Last year, for example, more than 10 million acres burned in the West &#8212; 10 million acres &#8212; not counting the lives lost and homes lost.  More land than exists in my home state of Delaware and my neighboring state of Maryland combined.  So if a fire swept through and took out every single thing in the state of Delaware and Maryland.  The drought conditions, this year, are twice as bad.  You&#8217;ve seen the pictures.  Reservoirs that are 40 feet down, 50 feet down. <br><br>The extreme weather isn’t just in the West.  In Illinois, farmers downstate are dealing with more frequent droughts.  And two weeks ago, just south of here, you just had a nearly unprecedented tornado. <br><br>We can&#8217;t wait any longer to deal with the climate crisis.  We see it with our own eyes, and it&#8217;s time to act.<br><br>The bipartisan agreement we reached makes some major strides.  It&#8217;s going to allow the transition of thousands of old, for example, of diesel school buses and buses &#8212; city buses.  We&#8217;re going to change them to electric buses.  There are roughly a half a million of these iconic yellow school buses on the road today.  Ninety-five percent of them run on diesel, for example.   And diesel pollutes the air and is linked to asthma and other health problems, and it hurts our communities and it causes our students to miss school.<br><br>I&#8217;ll put Americans to work capping tens of thousands of abandoned oil and gas wells that are leaking methane.  It&#8217;s devastating.  And the wages to fill these &#8212; cap these wells are the same wages that it took to dig the wells, making people earn &#8212; be able to earn a prevailing wage to do it.  There’s thousands of them.<br><br>But we need to go further.<br><br>I want to provide tax cuts for businesses and consumers who invest in clean energy technologies like renewables, battery storage, next-generation aviation fuels, electric vehicles. <br>I want to set the clean electricity standard that moves us to a fully clean and reliable grid.<br><br>These steps are going to create good-paying union jobs and spur demand for domestic manufacturing, accelerating clean energy and clean cars, growing our capacity to build those technologies on factory floors with union workers, here in the United States.<br><br>And we create a new generation of jobs in clean energy and manufacturing.  And I also want to enlist a new generation of climate, conservation, and reliance workers &#8212; excuse me, resilience workers &#8212; like FDR did when the American work plan &#8212; preserving our landscape with a Civilian Conservation Corps.  It’s a similar thing.<br><br>We can put Americans to work strengthening public lands and waters, and making our communities &#8212; rural and urban &#8212; more resilient against extreme weather.  And we can take on the long-overdue work of advancing environmental justice by addressing pollution.<br><br>My plan is also going to give grants to spur innovative policies and land projects &#8212; lo- &#8212; excuse me, local projects, like installing community solar and storage and disadvanta- &#8212; in disadvantaged communities; replacing streetlights that are made in America with LED bulbs that cost a whole lot less and last a whole lot longer; making upgrades in homes and schools<br>and community centers to boost energy efficiency and cut electric bills.<br><br>Folks, I’ve laid out a lot of plans here, but that’s because it’s time, and we have to think bigger, and we have to act bolder, and we have to build back better.<br><br>When we passed the American Rescue Plan, the naysayers and the doubters said it wouldn’t work.  Well, we’ve created over 3 million jobs since I took office &#8212; more jobs in the first months of a presidential administration than any time in American history. <br><br>And last week, the Congressional Budget Office<br>doubled their projections of the 2021 economic growth from 3.2 percent to 7.4 percent, and the OECD thinks it could be higher.  That puts the America Rescue Plan &#8212; and our work is going to move forward to do a lot of things, including &#8212; we’re close to defeating the virus. <br><br>The last time energy &#8212; the economy grew at this rate was in 1984 and Ronald Reagan was telling us it was an American morning.  Well, this is going to be an American century.  (Applause.)<br><br>With my American Families Plan and the other elements of the Build Back Better agenda, experts and Wall Street analysts have said that we’ll create millions of good-paying jobs for years and decades to come, not just in the near term.<br><br>So, I’m going to be making the case to the American people until the job is done, until we bring this bipartisan deal home, until we meet the needs of families today and the economy of tomorrow.  And we can pay for it. <br><br>Let me give you a rough example.  This isn’t &#8212; you know, and by the way, the American &#8212; the &#8212; the plan for infrastructure is paid for.  It’s paid for.  And this plan that I&#8217;m talking about &#8212; which is really expensive if you add it all up &#8212; well, guess what?  The fact is that it’s paid for as well.  And let me tell you how we’re going to pay for it.<br><br>Some of the ways to pay for the rest of it is: The last couple of years, for example, 55 of the Fortune 500 companies making billions of dollars did not pay a single penny in taxes &#8212; not one single cent.<br><br>Well, I don’t want to punish anybody, but everybody &#8212; and I hope someday my grandchildren grow up to be billionaires.  That&#8217;d be wonderful, especially for a guy who for 36 years was listed as the poorest man in United States Congress.  (Laughter.) <br><br>But having said that, all kidding aside, everybody has to pay their fair share.  I&#8217;m not trying to gouge anybody, but, I mean, just get in the game. <br><br>If we put in place a minimum 15 percent tax on the profits of corporations, the ones that didn&#8217;t pay any tax, that would raise a quarter of a trillion dollars &#8212; $240 billion. <br><br>But there&#8217;s a loophole in the system called “stepped-up basis.”  That loophole goes: If I made a capital gains and I was a wealthy person, and I was going to cash in my stock, and I was going to have to pay a tax, I was going to make, you know, $400,000, and I was going to pay X amount of taxes &#8212; if, on the way to cash it in I get hit by a truck, God forbid, and died, and it was left to my daughter, there would be no tax paid.  It’s not an inheritance tax.  It was a tax due 10 seconds earlier. <br><br>We closed that loophole, and that saves us $400 billion a year &#8212; not a year &#8212; $400 billion over this period, which is enough to pay for the Child &#8212; Child <s>Care</s> Tax Credit. <br><br>If we end tax breaks for fossil fuels, and make polluters pay to clean up the messes they&#8217;ve made, that would raise $90 billion.  We’re not asking them to do anything that &#8212; that is unfair; we’re just not going to subsidize them anymore.  They&#8217;re doing well, thank &#8212; thank you.  And the messes they made, they should clean up. <br><br>Well, if we ask the top 1 percent &#8212; and I hope many of you are in the top 1 percent &#8212; maybe.  (Laughter.)<br><br>You know, that tax cut that was passed in 2017 was all &#8212; it raised the deficit by over $2 trillion &#8212; not a penny paid for, and it didn&#8217;t come back with anything.  That &#8212; that, in fact &#8212; that entire $2 trillion &#8212; the vast majority went to the top one-tenth of 1 percent of the American people. <br><br>One percent &#8212; you know, if we just &#8212; 1 percent &#8212; the folks in the top 1 percent, if they just paid their personal income state tax, the same as it was under President George Bush &#8212; George W. Bush &#8212; that would generate $13 billion a year.  It would raise the tax from what it is now, 35, to 39 percent.  It’s what it &#8212; I mean, it&#8217;s not like this idea where you’d listen to the guy that used to have his job that somehow we’re gouging people.<br><br>The fact of the matter is, a lot of you, if you&#8217;re &#8212; if you&#8217;re a plumber or a teacher, you&#8217;re probably paying 25, 26 percent.  Some of you be paying higher. <br><br>But, here, look: It&#8217;s enough to provide for &#8212; that one change &#8212; enough to provide for two years free community college for every student in America. <br><br>Now &#8212; (applause) &#8212; now, people say that one of the purposes of taxes is to also generate growth along with making sure that we can pay for our basic needs. <br><br>Well, let me ask you, what is more likely to grow the economy and enhance us: continuing the tax cut at 37 percent, or spending &#8212; having to pay 39-point &#8212; and a half percent, generating economic growth?  Because now you have a tax system that will allow millions of students to go to community college. <br><br>When I was with Barack as Vice President, he asked me to do a study.  And I spent &#8212; and I &#8212; your sister, Penny Pritzker, was part of my effort to taking care of it.  And the effort was simple.  It came along, and we said, “Okay, what do we…” &#8212; and we (inaudible) three hundred and, I think, forty-seven &#8212; don’t hold me to the exact number &#8212; of the CEOs of the Fortune 500 companies.  Said, “What do you need most?”  You know what they said to almost &#8212; to a person?  “I need a better-educated workforce.”  They&#8217;re not prepared to pay for it. <br><br>Imagine if we present the world a nation with a better educated workforce.  It helps everybody.  The point is, we can pay for our entire plan and make the tax system fairer for all Americans.  It&#8217;s about time.<br><br>There&#8217;s a lot of work ahead of us to finish the job, but we’re going to get it done.  We’re going to reimagine what our economy and our future could be, and show the world &#8212; just as importantly, we’ll show ourselves &#8212; that democracy &#8212; democracy can deliver for the people of Illinois and the people of America, and the world can lead again.  (Applause.) <br><br>Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.  I know that&#8217;s a boring speech, but it&#8217;s an important speech. <br><br>God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. <br><br>Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Appreciate it. <br><br>And excuse my back.  I apologize.  I apologize.  Thank you.  (Applause.) <br><br>2:17 P.M. CDT</p>

<p>Q Mr. President, Mitch McConnell says you&#8217;re in for a heck of a fight on this one.</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT: Mitch McConnell loves our programs. Did you see what Mitch McConnel said? He told me he wasn’t going to get a single vote in order to allow me to get, with the help of everybody here, that $1.9 trillion tax cut &#8212; I mean, excuse me, program to &#8212; for economic growth.</p>



<p>Look it up, man. He&#8217;s bragging about in Kentucky: “It&#8217;s a great thing for Kentucky. It&#8217;s getting $4 billion to help poor.” It&#8217;s amazing. Check out Mitch McConnell. You can even see it on TV.</p>



<p>Anyway, thanks. Thank you.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Aboard Air Force One<br>En Route Crystal Lake, Illinois</p>



<p>11:13 A.M. CDT</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Hi, everyone.&nbsp; Welcome to our trip to Crystal Lake, Illinois.&nbsp; In Crystal Lake, the President will make the case for generational investments in human infrastructure and other critical priorities like clean energy that form his Build Back Better agenda, a combination of the American Families Plan, and policies from the American Jobs Plan that aren’t included in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework.</p>



<p>At McHenry County College, which has workforce development programs and a childcare center, the President will underline the specific game-changing impacts of the Buil- &#8212; his Build Back Better agenda.</p>



<p>He will argue that to build an economy from the bottom up and the middle out, we need to invest in our people by providing four additional years of public education to every student, increasing Pell Grants and investing in job training.</p>



<p>You’ll also hear him talk about the fact that, as a former single father, he will &#8212; he will stress that his plan is to help boost childcare affordability by building new childcare centers and ensuring that no middle-class family pays more than 7 percent of their income on high-quality care for children up to age five.</p>



<p>He will also note that the Build Back Better plan will invest in the childcaring workforce, provide parents with an up to $8,000 tax credit to cover their childcare expenses, institute 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave, and extand [sic] &#8212; and extend the expanded Child Tax Credit from the Rescue Plan.</p>



<p>Finally, with over 10 million Americans currently paying over half of what they earn in rent, the President will cover how the Build Back Better agenda includes a historic investment in affordable housing &#8212; something I think you all haven’t heard him talk about that much yet &#8212; to address supply and building or rehabilitating more than 2 million homes.</p>



<p>One other item for all of you: Today we also announced three initiatives as part of the President’s forthcoming executive order, fulfilling his campaign promise to promote competition in labor markets in order to raise wages and make it easier for workers to change jobs and to move between states.&nbsp;</p>



<p>First, roughly half of private sector businesses require at least some employees to enter non-compete agreements, affecting over 30 million people.&nbsp; This affects construction workers, hotel workers, many blue-collar jobs, not just high-level executives.&nbsp; He believes that if someone offers you a better job, you should be able to take it.&nbsp; It makes sense.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, in keeping with his campaign promise, the executive order will call on the FTC to adopt rules that curtail non- compete agreements.&nbsp; His executive order will also call on the Federal Trade Commission to adopt rules that ban unnecessary occupational licensing requirements.&nbsp; Today, almost 30 percent of jobs in the U.S. require a license from attorneys and accountants to interior designers and hairdressers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While occupational licensing can serve important health and safety concerns, unnecessary or overly burdensome licensing can lock people out of jobs.&nbsp; This hugely affects military families in particular, over one third of whom work in a field requiring a license and who are subject to military-directed moves every year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Finally, a little update for you on vaccine doses.&nbsp; Today we&#8217;re announcing we are sharing more doses with Latin America.&nbsp; One million Johnson &amp; Johnson doses will be headed to Bolivia on Thursday.&nbsp; One million doses of Pfizer will be sent to Paraguay.</p>



<p>Sorry, actual last thing: The Department of Education also released today nearly $6 billion in American Rescue Plan funds to six states and Washington, D.C., to support the safe reopening of K-through-12 schools.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lots going on.&nbsp; Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A couple of questions.&nbsp; Off the top, I know the midterms are a while away, but they come quicker than you expect, so can we talk politics a little bit, partly because the President has visited three top targeted congressional districts in the past week.&nbsp; Obviously, today is one of them.&nbsp; So, considering the party in power typically loses seats in a midterm, is part of the strategy right now to mitigate those potential losses?&nbsp; And does the White House see the President&#8217;s policies as swaying voters in the upcoming midterms?</p>



<p>Well, first, I would say that the President is visiting this district in Illinois today because Congresswoman &#8212; in part because Congresswoman Lauren Underwood has &#8212; is a registered nurse.&nbsp; She&#8217;s a champion for healthcare and expanding access to affordable healthcare.&nbsp; And that certainly is part of what&#8217;s under discussion and what is part of his Build Back Better agenda.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I will say that when the President put together his economic plans &#8212; his Build Back Better agenda, the American Rescue Plan, the American Jobs Plan, the American Families Plan &#8212; what he had in mind was governing for all Americans &#8212; Democrats, Republicans &#8212; and making clear that he was going to be the President for everyone, not just the people who voted for him.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And certainly the most effective role he can play as President, as Commander-in-Chief, and certainly as leader of the party, is to go out there and do what he does best, which is to be the “explainer-in-chief” and make &#8212; and lay out the specific plans and specific ways his plans, his proposals, and the agenda of the Democratic Party, but also his administration, are going to help people across the country.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, on these cyberattacks, the RNC was just attacked by a likely Russian actor.&nbsp; And so, considering that reining in these cyberattacks was a central focus of the Putin summit, does the President still believe that that summit was a success considering we&#8217;ve seen two new Russia-linked cyberattacks in the last week?</p>



<p>And then, coming out of this interagency meeting that just happened, can you tell us a little bit more about what went on there and if there were any sort of clear retaliatory actions that the U.S. is considering in response to these attacks?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; First, on the RNC report &#8212; because I think some of the reporting got a little ahead of where the administration is and where actual attribution is.&nbsp; I&#8217;d also note that the RNC put out a statement conveying this was a third-party vendor and that none of their data was accessed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So we, of course, are investigating.&nbsp; The FBI, CISA are in touch with the RNC, and when &#8212; we will determine attribution and make a decision accordingly.</p>



<p>As it relates to the meeting that the President had earlier today, he met &#8212; the President and the Vice President, I should say, met this morning with our national security team as a part of an internal update briefing on our across-whole-of-government effort to address ransomware attacks.</p>



<p>Now, I would remind all of you that ransomware attacks are not new; they long predated this administration.&nbsp; What is new is this level of engagement at the &#8212; at a high level &#8212; at the highest level, ongoing high-level engagement from our national security officials with the Russian government, and expert-level talks about the cyber and ransomware attacks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, in this meeting, they provided an update on their ongoing work: surge capacity, resilience and reporting, addressing payment systems, and our ongoing efforts to combat ransomware.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We don&#8217;t have anything new to report in terms of attribution, nor do we have anything to preview in terms of operational actions or considerations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What we do continue &#8212; what we did &#8212; they did discuss is the fact that the President reserves the right to respond against any ransomware networks and those that harbor them.&nbsp; That continues to be his policy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But what did the President mean today when he said, at departure, that he would “deliver” this message to Putin?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I think the question was &#8212; I can&#8217;t remember what the context &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The question was, “What’s your message to Putin?”&nbsp; And he said, “I’ll deliver it to him.”</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I think he wasn&#8217;t going to share with all of you what he just discussed in a private briefing.&nbsp; (Inaudible.)</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Has the RNC asked the administration for assistance at all?&nbsp; Have you been in &#8212; has the administration &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; The FBI and CISA have been in touch with the RNC, yes.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, can I ask for an update on OPEC?&nbsp; Do you have any new details about outreach from the administration &#8212; who&#8217;s been doing that?&nbsp; Do you still feel encouraged, like you did yesterday, as the talks continue to drag out?&nbsp; And just a general kind of status check on how things are going.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I certainly understand your question.&nbsp; We don&#8217;t have any update from yesterday.&nbsp; Just to reiterate: While we&#8217;re not a party of OPEC, we are in touch with key participants in these discussions.&nbsp; We&#8217;re encouraged that they&#8217;re continuing, but we don&#8217;t have any update on the status.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still don&#8217;t expect the President to get involved directly at any point?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have any expectation of that at this point, or prediction (inaudible).</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I go back to cyber just for one second?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You mentioned payment systems, and I know that you’re looking into whether &#8212; you know, how to approach this &#8212; how ransoms are paid, and whether they should be paid in that entire question.&nbsp; But given the role that cryptocurrencies are playing in that, is that an area that you&#8217;re looking into for further investigations?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah, that’s a part of ransom payments.&nbsp; And I should just say that part of this is there&#8217;s been ongoing work led by Deputy National Security Advisor Anne Neuberger and others across the government to consider what has long been a range of issues as it relates to ransomware attacks.&nbsp; And certainly cryptocurrency, the role of cryptocurrency, the role of payment systems is a part of that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Surge capacity &#8212; the importance of partnering but also encouraging the private sector to harden their own protections &#8212; that&#8217;s all part of it.&nbsp; And this was a internal, you know, somewhat standard update, but one with an across-the-government representation.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then one more on that.&nbsp; So, sanctions are one of the tools that you&#8217;ve used against Russia.&nbsp; You used them in response to election interference issues.&nbsp; And I&#8217;m wondering, if this is something that we see happening with the RNC &#8212; another leg of Russia attempting to interfere in the political process here &#8212; do you still see sanctions as a viable tool for dealing with that?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, first, I would say, on the RNC piece, I think it&#8217;s really important to asse- &#8212; to speak to where we are in this moment, which is the RNC has put out a statement conveying this was a third-party vendor.&nbsp; They&#8217;ve said none of their data was accessed.&nbsp; So it&#8217;s not that at this point.&nbsp; We&#8217;re investigating.&nbsp; We&#8217;ll conclude the investigation and make an assessment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In terms of operational considerations, obviously it&#8217;s not in our interest to preview those or preview our punches, as I like to say.&nbsp; The President has a range of options should he determine to take action.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Afghanistan: How is the U.S. going to continue its civilian &#8212; its civil and humanitarian support for the country if the Taliban continues its march?&nbsp; Is there a plan to work with the Taliban?&nbsp; Is there &#8212; how do you do it?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, first, there are ongoing political negotia- &#8212;</p>



<p>(Turbulence on the plane.)</p>



<p>Ooh, okay.&nbsp; Oh, okay, let&#8217;s see how this happens here.&nbsp; Everyone is okay on the plane &#8212; happy to report &#8212; currently.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Alex has been teaching me.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve flown a little, but everyone seems fine.</p>



<p>Okay.&nbsp; Okay, sorry.&nbsp; To get back to your question: So, there are a number of efforts that will be underway; one are political negotiations.&nbsp; Certainly, the State Department would provide an update of when those will reconvene, but we certainly expect and hope and are supportive of the continuation of those political discussions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the reasons that the President made the decision he did is because he does not feel there&#8217;s a military solution for a 20-year war.&nbsp; Has &#8212; has long felt there was not a military solution.&nbsp; Diplomatic negotiations.</p>



<p>Two, as he reiterated when Afghan leaders were here just a couple of weeks ago, we will continue to provide, as you said, humanitarian assistance, security assistance.&nbsp; We intend to continue to have a diplomatic presence on the ground in Kabul, even after we bring the servicemen and women home at the end of August.&nbsp; So, that is a mechanism for that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I would say, three, obviously, as you know, we&#8217;re going to continue to work with partners in the region to plan for our own CT preparations.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On vaccination: Yesterday, you talked about door knocking, which is a pretty standard thing, and it was picked up in the far-right sphere as, you know, “the government is going to come to your door and make you get a vaccine.”&nbsp; I am wondering your reaction to that and what that type of messaging does for the efforts to, you know, convince people who might be hesitant to get vaccinated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I appreciate the question.&nbsp; Well, let me tell you what this is and what it is not.&nbsp; What this effort is is a continuation of what we have seen as an impactful effort that we&#8217;ve had by local public health officials and volunteers in a range of communities over the last month of action.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve actually seen an impact &#8212; a positive impact of a range of steps we’ve taken in states like Florida, Mississippi, others where there have been lower vaccination rates.&nbsp; There&#8217;s been actually an increase by over 4 percent in Florida, over the last month, of adults.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But what we&#8217;re doing is local officials are going to areas where there are lower vaccination rates and providing information on where people can get access to a vaccine, where they can go, that it&#8217;s free, that they can take time off of work.&nbsp; It&#8217;s up to individuals to decide whether they want to get vaccinated or not.</p>



<p>But what we&#8217;ve seen as a barrier all along, for months, has been access and information, and so we’re going to continue to deploy the tactic &#8212; tactics that we&#8217;ve seen effective over the last few months.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And a lot of folks in the public health world have said that while they appreciate the voluntary nature, that you guys are &#8212; you know, what you just said, that it&#8217;s up to the individual to get vaccinated &#8212; they also think that the only way to get to, sort of, much larger numbers of vaccinated people is if there are mandates &#8212; whether those be mandates by private companies for their employees or universities or public schools or states that mandate for different kinds of, you know, healthcare workers or others.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yesterday, when I asked you the question, you said you had no interest in the government &#8212; that the administration has no interest in encouraging that.&nbsp; I mean, is that really the position of the federal government, is that you do not want to encourage the kind of mandates that public health officials say would work?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I think, for clarity, that&#8217;s not currently the role of the federal government.&nbsp; And our role is to provide supply, provide information, provide public health experts.&nbsp; As &#8212; to your point, there are a number of private sector entities, universities, institutions that are starting to mandate, and that&#8217;s an innovative step that they will take and they should take.&nbsp; That&#8217;s not &#8212; and we&#8217;re not taking issue with that.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But public health officials say that you guys are in a &#8212; and the President of the United States, with his bully pulpit and, you know, obviously taking not the kind of hands-off approach that Donald Trump took to federal (inaudible) &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I would say first &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; they want you to &#8212; they want you to be part of pushing these institutions to do that.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; But, Mike, I think the important thing to remind everyone of is that, one, we have reduced the rate of COVID by 90 percent.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve reduced the death rate by 90 percent.&nbsp; Almost 70 percent of the adult population is vaccinated, and we&#8217;re continuing to press further.</p>



<p><a>There are institutions, there are private sector entities that will take this step.&nbsp; We&#8217;re not standing in their way.&nbsp; Those are innovative steps.&nbsp; Go forward and take steps that you feel are appropriate.&nbsp; We&#8217;re just talking about what the steps are, what the role is of the federal government.</a></p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You had said to me that you&#8217;re sort of trapped between &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Inaudible) on the violence in Chicago?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The administration is sort of trapped between the people who are saying, “You need to do more; you need to mandate or you&#8217;re just not going to reach people,” and the people who are saying, “Oh, my God.&nbsp; The government is going to mandate this.”&nbsp; It seems like you&#8217;re kind of stuck in the middle.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; But I think what we continue to remember is what constructive role we can play as the federal government, and that includes continuing to use resources to get out into communities; to empower public health officials; to get accurate information out; to ensure people understand, as the CDC put out information earlier today or overnight, that 50 percent of the indivi- &#8212; of the cases are now, as a result of the Delta variant, higher in areas where there are lower vaccination rates.</p>



<p>That is the role where we&#8217;re going to spend our energy and our resources.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can we get the White House reaction to the violence in Chicago &#8212; those three officers shot overnight, one of whom was an ATF agent?&nbsp; There&#8217;s an alderman in Chicago who is asking that the President come in the wake of what happened.&nbsp; He says, quote, “Our communities and police officers are under siege.”&nbsp; What&#8217;s the President&#8217;s message as we’re about to land there and he&#8217;s about to meet with the mayor of that city?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; Well, let me first say that we are closely monitoring the situation in coordination with the Department of Justice and ATF.&nbsp; We stand ready to provide any assistance needed.&nbsp; Our thoughts go out to the two ATF agents and the Chicago Police Department officer who were wounded, as well as their families and fellow agents and officers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As the President has said many times, every time a law enforcement officer pins on their shield and walks out the door, they&#8217;re carrying a sacred responsibility.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I will note that, in terms of the efforts the President has underway to address the rise in violence we&#8217;ve seen over the last 18 months, including in Chicago, there are a number of steps that impact Chicago directly and specifically, including &#8212; his Rescue Plan is giving cities like Chicago &#8212; alone is getting almost $1.9 billion through the Rescue Plan.&nbsp; Cook County is getting over $1 billion.&nbsp; And the state government of Illinois is receiving an additional $8.13 billion.</p>



<p>As a part of our gun crime reduction strategy, Chicago is also taking part in a community violence intervention collaborative with 15 jurisdictions nationwide to help them invest in proven evidence-based, community-based strategies.</p>



<p>And Chicago is also one of the five cities we announced recently that&#8217;s going to be &#8212; we&#8217;re going to be working with &#8212; the Department of Justice is going to be working with in launching a gun trafficking strike force &#8212; there&#8217;s four other cities, I should say, nationwide &#8212; to help interrupt gun trafficking corridors that send crime into Chicago from across the city and state lines.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will he visit?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Will he visit &#8212; our plans today have not changed in terms of our travel plans.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Has the President spoken to Governor Pritzker or Mayor Lightfoot this week, following the extremely violent weekends?&nbsp; Has he &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; He&#8217;s going to see both of them today.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, on the bipartisan infrastructure plan &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; we still haven&#8217;t seen congressional scoring or legislative language, especially on the payfors.&nbsp; Is that a signal that, you know, they’re still in that, kind of, “coffee, late-night” area that you discussed before?&nbsp; Or might we a- &#8212; the alternate solution is that there&#8217;s been a problem with the scoring and it doesn&#8217;t quite add up?&nbsp; Is there a possibility that the payfors change in any way at this point?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I think the order of events here, as I think you&#8217;re alluding to, is they need to write the legislation first, which they&#8217;re working on over the coming days.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One on Haiti.&nbsp; I believe that you sent out a tweet &#8212; and I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s happened in the past hour and a half, but I believe the U.S. Embassy in Haiti has not tweeted any form of tweet about what happened, and a lot of the Western embassies have.&nbsp; So I&#8217;m just checking to see if there&#8217;s any sort of, like, friction or &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, we put out a statement from the President.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you think the U.S. Embassy in Haiti should be putting out &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I would ask the State Department that question.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t &#8212; I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s an issue.&nbsp; We put out a statement from the President on it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We’re about to land.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Has the U.S. been asked to help in Haiti?&nbsp; I mean, I know that you guys are providing whatever &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We stand prepared to assist.&nbsp; We&#8217;re certainly in touch, but obviously this is &#8212; this is still developing, and so we&#8217;ll assess what their needs are.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re ready to provide needs &#8212;&nbsp;you know, respond to the needs they ask for.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp;</p>
