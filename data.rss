<p class="has-text-align-center">James S. Brady Press Briefing Room</p>



<p>2:38 P.M. EDT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:  Hi, everyone.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Happy Friday.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Happy Friday.&nbsp; Is there more to say on this historic day?&nbsp; (Laughter.)</p>



<p>Okay.&nbsp; So, I want to first start by outlining our security assistance to Ukraine, and there&#8217;s been a lot of good questions about this, and we thought this would be a helpful rundown for all of you.&nbsp; It&#8217;s &#8212; the Department of Defense also put out a factsheet that has this detailed as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The security assistance the Biden administration is providing to Ukraine is enabling critical success on the battlefield against the Russian-invading force.&nbsp; The number one reason that they&#8217;re able to fight back is their bravery and courage.&nbsp; The number two reason is the security assistance that we are providing and we are providing in coordination with our allies and partners.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We&#8217;re working around the clock to fulfill Ukraine&#8217;s priority security assistance requests, delivering weapons from U.S. stocks when they are available, and facilitating the delivery of weapons by allies and partners when their systems better suit Ukraine&#8217;s needs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All of the anti-armor and anti-air systems from the two packages of security assistance the President approved in March have been delivered.&nbsp; We are continuing work with allies and partners to identify additional weapons systems to help the Ukrainian military defend its country.&nbsp; Obviously, there was the announcement about the S-300s earlier today, and our efforts to work to backfill that.</p>



<p>At President Zelenskyy’s request, this includes helping Ukraine acquire long-range anti-aircraft systems and munitions that they are trained to use.&nbsp; More than 30 nations have sent Ukraine security assistance, thanks in part to the leadership of President Biden and diplomacy that he has been implementing for months now.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On April 5th, we announced an additional $100 million in security assistance to Ukraine through a presidential drawdown authority.&nbsp; We also announced $300 million in security assistance on April 1st under authorities provided by the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative.&nbsp; These announcements bring the U.S. commitment to more than $1.7 billion in security assistance since Russia&#8217;s February 24th invasion, and $2.4 billion since the beginning of the administration.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I will not read through all of this for you.&nbsp; You can all, of course, read it yourself.&nbsp; And we will provide all of the list to all of you should &#8212; if you did not receive the Department of Defense factsheet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I also wanted to note that, today, according to a new independent study, the Biden administration&#8217;s historic vaccination program saved 2.3 million lives in the United States, prevented 17 million hospitalizations and 66 million cases, and avoided $900 billion in healthcare costs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over the past 15 months, the President has mounted a successful nationwide vaccination effort while executing a comprehensive strategy on treatments, testing, and more.&nbsp; As a result, schools are open, our economy is booming.&nbsp; And importantly, today&#8217;s report shows we&#8217;ve spared millions of families the immeasurable loss that too many others have suffered.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And because of the President&#8217;s comprehensive response, we&#8217;ve entered a new moment in our fight against the virus.&nbsp; While COVID isn&#8217;t over, Americans now have more tools than ever before to protect themselves and this country is moving forward safely, back to many of our more normal routines.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unfortunately, Republicans in Congress are holding up critical funding we need to make even more progress to save even more lives and to stay prepared against any potential surges or variants.&nbsp; Inaction will leave our nation less prepared for future surges and variants.&nbsp; It will mean fewer vaccines, treatments, and tests for the American people.&nbsp; This is deeply disappointing, and it should be unacceptable to every American.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I also wanted to give you a sense of the week ahead.&nbsp; Just one trip next week that we announced earlier today &#8212; at this point.&nbsp; There could be more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On Thursday, the President will travel to Greensboro, North Carolina, to discuss his administration&#8217;s efforts to make more in America, rebuild our supply chains here at home, and bring down costs for the American people as part of building a better America.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Following that trip, he will travel to Camp David, where he will remain over the Easter weekend.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And then, finally, as I&#8217;ve been doing a little bit this week, I just want to shout out some amazing colleagues I have: Lewis, who we have stolen from FEMA &#8212; not really stolen; he&#8217;s a detailee.&nbsp; Well, he&#8217;s a fellow, actually.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve had him since November.&nbsp; Soon, they will steal him back.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And Lewis has been remarkable.&nbsp; Lewis has been reading Russian media, which comes in use &#8212; in great use.&nbsp; He has been tracking down a range of coverage about the war in Ukraine.&nbsp; He has been relentless in giving us updates and providing us information.&nbsp; And we’re incredibly grateful to Lewis, and we’ll be sad to see you go back to FEMA to do very important work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many of you know Amanda Finney.&nbsp; I call her “the mayor” because she knows every person, seemingly, who works in the building and on the complex, which is about 2,000 people.&nbsp; I would not survive this job without Amanda Finney.&nbsp; You probably would all not have received all the help you have received about a range of things without Amanda Finney.&nbsp; She is smart, sassy, levelheaded, stable.&nbsp; She&#8217;s remarkable.&nbsp; And we may all work for her one day in some capacity.&nbsp; I certainly may.&nbsp; But I&#8217;m very grateful to her.&nbsp; So, I just wanted to shout that out.&nbsp; And her yellow suit is very joyful for a joyful day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Okay, with that &#8212; it&#8217;s a Friday!&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It’s Friday.&nbsp; Thanks so much.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve got a couple things.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First on this &#8212; the missile attack at this train station.&nbsp; Does the administration think that Russia might have intentionally targeted the train station, knowing that there will be a lot of civilians there?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, what we&#8217;ve seen over the course of the last six weeks &#8212; or more than that &#8212; has been what the President himself has characterized as war crimes, which is the intentional targeting of civilians.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is yet another horrific atrocity committed by Russia, striking civilians who were trying to evacuate and reach safety.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Where we are now is we&#8217;re going to support efforts to investigate this attack as we document Russia&#8217;s actions, hold them accountable.&nbsp; And we will continue to surge security assistance and weapons deliveries to help Ukraine defend their country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Obviously, the targeting of civilians would certainly be a war crime. &nbsp;And we&#8217;ve already called a range of the actions we&#8217;ve seen to date a war crime, but we&#8217;re going to be supporting efforts to investigate exactly what happened here.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Changing topics.&nbsp; Senior administration officials have said publicly on TV, suggesting it&#8217;s possible the President could get COVID.&nbsp; I&#8217;m wondering: Is the administration attempting to prepare the public for the possibility of the President getting the &#8212; testing positive?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, what we&#8217;re trying to do is be as transparent and direct with the American people as possible about the fact that while the President is &#8212; takes a range of protocols, we have a range of protocols in place here that are aligned and even beyond the CDC requirements.&nbsp; Those include, as we&#8217;ve outlined here many times in the past, testing before you see the President, testing before you travel with him, social distancing when possible.</p>



<p>We believe we have the tools and protocol to address this point we are in the virus.&nbsp; But like anyone else, the President may at some point test positive for COVID.&nbsp; And while we have seen an increase in recent &#8212; I would just note: While we have seen an increase in cases around people, I should just say, that some of us may know, I would also note that cases remain down 95 percent since the height of Omicron.&nbsp; That is fact, that is data, even as we&#8217;ve seen cases of people we know.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But what is important for the American people to know is that he has taken a range of precautions, as we all have.&nbsp; But he&#8217;s also taken steps &#8212; like getting the second booster, as he did last week in public.&nbsp; And his doctors are comfortable that he could continue to carry out his duties because of all these steps and precautions and protections he&#8217;s taken.&nbsp; And we &#8212; certainly, that&#8217;s one of the reasons we encourage the rest of the American public to do the same.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you &#8212; this is the first time that we&#8217;ve heard a White House official sort of describe it as a certain possibility that the President could get COVID.&nbsp; Are you saying that you think it&#8217;s more possible now, given sort of the little outbreak that we&#8217;re seeing in D.C. right now?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; No.&nbsp; We&#8217;re just saying that it is a possibility.&nbsp; Again, we are &#8212; cases are down 95 percent across the country since the height of Omicron.&nbsp; While cases are up in Washington, D.C., they&#8217;re also far below the height of the cases and where they were in Omicron.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But it is also the case that despite all the precautions we take.&nbsp; And even with the President being double boosted, he could still test positive for COVID, just as people in the &#8212; many people in the White House have, many people in the press corps have.&nbsp; That is a possibility.&nbsp; And we want to be transparent with the American public about that.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By our rough count here, you have at least 18 politicians and people close to the President who have now tested positive this week, though.&nbsp; And you&#8217;ve reiterated all the extra precautions that you are taking to try and keep him safe &#8212; some of the extra masking and testing protocol.&nbsp; But just to be safe, have you considered maybe cutting down some of the big indoor events or scaling back any &#8212; or changing, sort of, your tactic with some of these events?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, clearly, we did the event &#8212; the historic event today outside.&nbsp; That was, in part, to ensure that we could have a huge number of people on the South Lawn celebrating the confirmation of Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson.&nbsp; But also, we know that having events outside is better for safety protocols.&nbsp; There&#8217;s no question about that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But what&#8217;s important for the American people to know and understand is that because of all the steps we&#8217;ve taken, because the President is double boosted, because of &#8212; you know, obviously he has access to the best healthcare in the world, but his doctors have assessed that these are risks that can be taken.&nbsp; We risk-assess just like everybody out in the country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And it&#8217;s important for him to be able to continue his presidential duties now and even if he tests positive in the future, just like Americans out there in the country are taking their kids to school, they go to the grocery store, maybe they&#8217;re making a decision to go to dinner.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a time where we are certainly living with the virus, but we have a range of tools at our disposal to do that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; A couple of quick questions on oil, and then one on the French election.&nbsp; We have some reporting showing that the administration is considering easing sanctions to allow some oil imports from Venezuela as a way to replace banned energy shipments from Russia.&nbsp; Can you talk a little bit about any such considerations?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I&#8217;m not aware of that being under consideration.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; At the moment, is it &#8212; is it going to perhaps be considered for &#8212; going forward?&nbsp; Or &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; It has not been, so I&#8217;m not aware of it being under consideration.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; And one other one on when Daleep was in India.&nbsp; He delivered this warning to India to not raise purchases of Russian oil.&nbsp; And we were wondering if perhaps sanctions along similar lines are being considered for other nations, asking them to keep purchases of Russian oil only limited to previous levels and, perhaps, not raise (inaudible).</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; First, I wouldn&#8217;t characterize it as a warning, nor did we at the time.&nbsp; He went and had a constructive conversation and made clear that while it&#8217;s the decision of each individual country, including India, to determine whether they&#8217;re going to import Russian oil, it is only 1 to 2 percent of their imports.&nbsp; About 10 percent of their imports is from the United States.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so he conveyed, of course, they should abide by sanctions, which are not related to that decision, but also, we would be here to help them diversify and move towards even reducing further beyond the 1 to 2 percent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is that decision, perhaps, being relayed also to other countries, asking them to perhaps follow the same guidelines?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, we convey to every country to abide by sanctions.&nbsp; And we&#8217;ve conveyed to a range of European countries, as you know and as we&#8217;ve talked about, that as they work to diversify their energy sources, that we are here to assist in those efforts.</p>



<p>And there are a range of steps we&#8217;ve taken, including efforts on LNG &#8212; I mean, that&#8217;s natural gas, of course &#8212; but efforts on LNG and moving some resources from Asia and other places, and ensuring that there are options to &#8212; for any country that wants to, to diversify their energy sources.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; And one on the French elections.&nbsp; Are you watching the French elections coming up this Sunday, perhaps, with any concerns &#8212; especially with the rise of Le Pen, who is a far-right candidate, running against Macron?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We are certainly watching the elections, but I don&#8217;t have any prediction of what the outcome will be.&nbsp; And once there is an outcome, I&#8217;m sure we will speak to it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Understanding it’s a fluid situation, but I think the atrocities in Bucha serve as an accelerant towards the latest sanctions package, the coordination between the G7 &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; That we announced two days ago?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yes.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there any sense that the strike that we saw this morning will also accelerate talks on additional sanctions between the coordinated allies?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would say just go &#8212; to go back to a couple of days ago, that obviously the sanctions package we announced on Wednesday, with some &#8212; the biggest bank in Russia, Sberbank, certainly that was augmented as a result of the atrocities that we were seeing in Bucha.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And what we have done to date and we will continue to do is look at, unfortunately, the continued atrocities that we&#8217;re seeing in the country and assess how that&#8217;s going to impact sanctions, consequences, and, obviously, additional security assistance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So that&#8217;s how we&#8217;ve been evaluating and working with our allies to date.&nbsp; And I&#8217;m certain, given the video footage we&#8217;ve seen on airwaves across the world and photos, that this will be a part of the discussion that our national security officials are having with their counterparts moving forward.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; On the S-300 &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Mm-hmm.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; it&#8217;s been fairly apparent for the last several weeks that that was a process that you guys were engaged in.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know you are deliberately ambiguous as to some of the other processes that may be taking place, but is it fair to say that there are multiple other tracks that are similarly far down the line for other weapons systems?&nbsp; Or how can you characterize how far along you are, compared to where you are now with the S-300, on other systems?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; So &#8212; well, one, I mean, part of our objective here &#8212; and the S-300s are an example of that &#8212; is to see that we can get defensive equipment that Ukrainians are trained on and that we know can be effective moved to Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So we are, of course, grateful to Slovakia and we work closely with Slovakia to also meet their defense needs.&nbsp; And part of our considerations here as we&#8217;re looking at the list of requests that the Ukrainians have is: What do we have access to here in the United States?&nbsp; What military equipment do we have access to?&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are systems we may not have access &#8212; access to or we may not even have those systems.&nbsp; So how can we work with countries around the world, like Slovakia, to meet those needs?</p>



<p>So there are a range of those conversations happening with our partners and allies at the same time.&nbsp; I will tell you that often it is the preference of these partners and allies not to be public about these conversations.&nbsp; And at times, it is the preference of the Ukrainians.&nbsp; And we certainly respect that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And just one final one.&nbsp; It&#8217;s been a pretty historic 24 hours &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; for the history of the Supreme Court, for the country.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve seen the President speak publicly.&nbsp; Can you talk about &#8212; do you have any color in terms of what he&#8217;s been like behind the scenes, delivering on a campaign pledge &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; putting the first African American woman on the Court &#8212; how he&#8217;s been with staff, with the justice, all that?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; I&#8217;m going to try not to ugly cry about this day, because &#8212; which we were all &#8212; we were all doing on the South Lawn.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Look, I was with the President before he went out.&nbsp; I was there on time; I didn&#8217;t run out, as you would have seen.&nbsp; I was with him before, when he was reviewing his &#8212; doing his final review of his remarks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And what he was reflecting on is &#8212; and you saw some of this in his speech &#8212; were the number of people, whether it is people who work at the White House; people who are part of his every day; you know, stewards or others who have commented to him how significant this moment is and how &#8212; you know, in a place where you are just trying to &#8212; trying to make it through every day &#8212; and every day is history, in many ways.</p>



<p>History can be heartbreaking.&nbsp; And many days, it has been.&nbsp; History can be exhausting.&nbsp; And many days, it has been.&nbsp; And history can be joyful.&nbsp; And today was a joyful day in history.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And that is certainly how the President was.&nbsp; You saw his granddaughter, Naomi, who he talked about in the speech, come out.&nbsp; She was there also for a brief greet with &#8212; with Justice Jackson beforehand.&nbsp; And he made a &#8212; made an effort to also introduce the new associate justice to some members of his close staff who just were inspired by the significance of today as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So I would say there was a deep recognition of this moment of history, a joy in reaching it.&nbsp; And I think we&#8217;ve all been saying to each other in the hallways, &#8220;No one can speal [sic] our &#8212; steal our sunshine today,&#8221; because that&#8217;s how everybody is feeling.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.&nbsp; To follow up on that, did the President spend any time with the Jackson family before the formal event or afterward (inaudible)?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I think, as we confirmed, she signed her commission &#8212; or he signed her commission, and her family was with her for that.&nbsp; So, it was briefly before he came out to do the remarks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay, got it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And to follow up on a question from Katie earlier this week about other precautions that the President may or may not be taking, do you know or he is taking any monoclonal antibodies to help prevent catching COVID?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, Evusheld is for immunocompromised.&nbsp; That would be the preemptive step.&nbsp; And he&#8217;s not immunocompromised, so he&#8217;s not taking Evusheld.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is taking any other medication that might help?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Like what?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, I don&#8217;t actually know.&nbsp; (Laughs.)&nbsp; That&#8217;s a great question.&nbsp; Other than the booster &#8212; you know, we&#8217;ve heard other people taking other kinds of prophylactics to prevent it.&nbsp; Is he taking anything, that you know of?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; There are not other &#8212; this is why I asked.&nbsp; There are not other &#8212; Evusheld is obviously one that, if you’re immunocompromised, is something that has been approved and recommended.&nbsp; Since he is not categorized that way, he isn’t taking it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But other than that, the precautions we’re taking are &#8212; he obviously got the booster when he was eligible last week, and, you know, we take additional steps, including testing, socially distanced meetings when possible as well, in order to protect him as much as possible.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; And then just one more on something that Samantha Power shared.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She said that Russian forces have killed at least seven journalists in Ukraine in six weeks and that Putin soldiers are killing journalists at an unprecedented rate.&nbsp; Is there any intelligence, any information that Putin is targeting journalists?&nbsp; And do you have any warning that you&#8217;re sharing with American journalists covering the war?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, one, we &#8212; we value the role that American journalists and journalists from around the world &#8212; (cell phone disruption) &#8212; that felt like a direction to somewhere &#8212; have played in &#8212; in bringing light &#8212; bringing to light for a lot of people in this country this war: what&#8217;s happening, the devastation, the horrors.&nbsp; It has been a &#8212; had a direct impact on people&#8217;s emotional response in the United States.&nbsp; There&#8217;s no question about that.</p>



<p>We recognize the work of journalists in war zones, of course, and value it.&nbsp; And as you all know, we also work very closely with leaders of news organizations to ensure that they have up-to-date information to keep members of their media organization safe.</p>



<p>It is still a war zone &#8212; an active war zone, and we&#8217;re still conveying that Americans should not be there &#8212; right? &#8212; including journalists.</p>



<p>In terms of specific targeting, we knew from the beginning &#8212; and we&#8217;ve talked publicly about this, of course &#8212; that President Putin and the Russian military was going to target &#8212; was intending to target or could target civilians and others, including journalists could be part of that.&nbsp; But I don&#8217;t have anything &#8212; any new intelligence or anything beyond that.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Go ahead.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; Is there a carve-out in CDC regulations for COVID for the Vice President?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Tell me more, Peter.&nbsp; I&#8217;m sure this is going somewhere.&nbsp; Let’s see.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, you know, the &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; What do you got for me on a Friday?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The CDC says, for people exposed to COVID, up to date on their COVID-19 vaccinations: Do not go to places where you are unable to wear a well-fitting mask.&nbsp; So why is she here at the White House today giving the new Supreme Court justice a big hug with no mask?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; You mean when she gave her a ma- &#8212; a hug outside?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; She was outside.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does the CDC say that people who are close contact can give people hugs outside?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We know, Peter, that outside it is &#8212; it is &#8212; you are &#8212; you can benefit significantly being outside.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why we have &#8212; we had the event outside today.</p>



<p>I will tell you that the Vice President has been wearing a mask inside.&nbsp; When there was a private greet, they were all wearing masks, before they went out &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We saw she was wearing a mask yesterday at the Senate.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; She was playing an important role in confirming or overseeing the confirmation of the first Black woman to the Supreme Court.&nbsp; The vast majority, as was on camera, Peter &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there a public health carve-out for that?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;As was on camera.&nbsp; Let me finish my answer here.&nbsp; Because Fox and other &#8212; I don’t know actually that Fox carried it, but others did &#8212; saw that she was socially distanced from people for the vast, vast majority of her time overseeing that confirmation yesterday.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So this is not a case of rules for thee but not for VP?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; In fact, the Vice President wore a mask inside today when she was both with the President, with her staff, other people.&nbsp; She was outside at the event.&nbsp; She was socially distanced for 99.9 percent of the event today.&nbsp; And she had an emotional moment, which is understandable.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; And one other topic.&nbsp; Following up on the smartphones that are being given to border crossers with technology so they can be tracked or so they can check in: Is there any plan to give free smartphones to U.S. citizens that want them?</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Should we not be tracking migrants who irregularly cross the border?</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I’m asking if the same &#8212;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Or do you have an alternative suggestion for how they should be tracked?</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I, unfortunately, have not been asked to make U.S. immigration policy.&nbsp; That’s not my &#8212;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Today’s your moment.&nbsp; (Laughter.)</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, it’d be great if anybody that wanted a free phone and a free monthly plan could get one.&nbsp; So, is that going to be an offer for everybody or just people that walk into the country illegally?</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, Peter, as &#8212; when we talked about this the other day, what I noted to you is that we have a range of means of tracking individuals who irregularly migrate to the country, as &#8212; in order to ensure that they are meeting their Notice to Appear obligations and that they are appearing in court when they should appear in court.&nbsp; Phones is one of them.&nbsp; There are also ankle devices and a range of tracking devices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Eighty percent of individuals have &#8212; of non-citizens released at the border from DHS custody under prosecutorial discretion have either received a Notice to Appear or are still within the window to report.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, yes, there is telephonic reporting.&nbsp; There is SmartLink, which enables participant monitoring via smartphone.&nbsp; There’s the Global Positioning System.&nbsp; These are the range of means with modern technology that we monitor.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last one on this: Does the President have any plans to figure out what these small towns who are bracing for a major influx in migrants next month need by making his first-ever trip to the border?</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I have nothing to predict for you in terms of additional trips.&nbsp; The President will be traveling the country, but I don’t have any more specifics for you at this point.&nbsp; Thanks for the question.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just for clarity: Earlier &#8212; earlier, you guys told us, via pool, that the President was tested &#8212; tested negative.&nbsp; That was today, for clarity?</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yup.&nbsp; Mm-hmm.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; So, the cadence has clearly changed.&nbsp; Right?&nbsp; We know there was one on Wednesday; he was negative.&nbsp; Today is Friday; he tested negative.&nbsp; Just for keeping track of his &#8212; is it now three times a week, two times a week?&nbsp; Is there a way to describe it?</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; His doctor makes an assessment on how many times he should be tested, and we do our best to provide that information to you as he’s tested.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And aside from the time he spent with Ketanji Brown Jackson and her family, there was no &#8212; because there’s precedent to this &#8212; there was no indoor reception, indoor ceremony that existed of some kind that the cameras didn’t see before?</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; No.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Let me &#8212; if I can, during his remarks today, the President said something that was a bit striking.&nbsp; He was condemning some of the conservative Republicans and their criticisms of Judge Jackson when she was testifying recently.&nbsp; He said: “There was verbal abuse.&nbsp; The anger.&nbsp; The constant interruptions.&nbsp; The most vile, baseless, [vile] assertions and accusations.”&nbsp; Whoo.&nbsp; Is that a preview of messaging that we’re going to hear from the President heading into the midterms?&nbsp; Was that &#8212; was that &#8212; is that a message that the White House wants to deliver and will be repeating?</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don’t believe that the conduct of senators at a hearing is going to be central to the President’s remarks when he’s out in &#8212; out traveling the country.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a>But I think what he was speaking to, on a historic day, is that while Judge Jackson was the picture &#8212; now Justice Jackson </a>&#8212; was the picture of dignity in her hearings, some others in the room decided to be the opposite.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And he is somebody who has more experience overseeing Supreme Court hearings than anyone living.&nbsp; He has overseen them during Republican and Democratic Presidents and expects a certain level of conduct, professionalism, and decorum.&nbsp; And that is not what we saw.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So that was more of a one-off for today, as opposed to, like, a central theme that we’ll see in terms of contrast?</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I would say that I think the American people can expect that he’ll continue to talk when he’s out in the country &#8212; for whatever reason &#8212; about how to bring down their costs, how to make sure that he is fighting for them, and bringing them relief, and how’s going to get the COVID pandemic under control &#8212; less about the conduct of senators at a hearing.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me ask a very quick question, then, on costs, if I can.&nbsp; Right now, the cost of gas in this country, on average, is $4.14. &nbsp;Does the White House want a gas tax holiday?</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Is it certainly on the table and certainly something we continue to consider.&nbsp; We have seen a number of states do that.&nbsp; And while, you know, it can have an impact &#8212; about 18 cents, I believe, if I remember correctly &#8212; one of the reasons why we’re considering it &#8212; our primary focus, to date, as you all know, has been taking steps to increase supply and get it &#8212; get more supply into the global marketplace.&nbsp; But it remains an option under consideration.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go ahead.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The U.N. today put out a report saying that global food prices in March reached a record high.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the U.S. doing, if anything, to mitigate possible additional increases here?</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Here in the United States?</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Correct.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, it is something that we are certainly watching very closely.&nbsp; While we continue to believe that the impact will largely be in the Middle East and in Africa, I believe, and a lot of, you know, other parts of the world &#8212; less in the United States &#8212; we are continuing to work &#8212; our Department of Agriculture is continuing to work with farmers and suppliers about any needs we have here.&nbsp; And the President is continuing to work to bring down costs in a range of areas for the American people, as we prepare for the impacts of this war.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was pretty widely reported yesterday, prior to her COVID diagnosis, that Speaker Pelosi was planning a trip to Taiwan.&nbsp; Beijing reacted very negatively to that.&nbsp; Is the U.S. &#8212; is the Biden administration comfortable if she were to do that &#8212; such a high-ranking U.S. official?</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don’t &#8212; I think we’ve understood her trip.&nbsp; I don’t have any further comment on it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; Two questions for you.&nbsp; The first: Today, my colleagues in the UK reported that the Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak had a U.S. green card, which he surrendered this past October.&nbsp; He&#8217;s been an MP since 2015.&nbsp; And USCIS manual says that serving in a foreign government while standing for election in a foreign government is not compatible with lawful permanent resident status.&nbsp; Why was this not flagged earlier?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I would point you to the State Department or the Department of Homeland Security.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have any more comment from here.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it &#8212; I mean, is it a problem?&nbsp; Does the President see it as a problem that &#8212; possible for someone to serve at high level in a foreign government and maintain lawful permanent resident status in the U.S?&nbsp; I mean, what if this were someone who was serving in the Russian Duma?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; It wasn&#8217;t.&nbsp; But I would also, again, point you to the portions of the government that oversee green cards and oversee, you know &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They haven’t responded.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; &#8212; the status of documents.&nbsp; I&#8217;m happy to bump it for them as well and see if there&#8217;s more we can provide.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That’s fine.&nbsp; The second question: There&#8217;s a death row inmate in Texas, Melissa Lucio.&nbsp; She&#8217;s set to be executed soon.&nbsp; Many experts believe her confession was coerced and is false.&nbsp; She has bipartisan support for clemency and support from the EU and many other foreign allies.&nbsp; Would the President consider asking Governor Abbott to intervene?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, you know the President&#8217;s position and view on the death penalty.&nbsp; And there&#8217;s an ongoing review at the Department of Justice at a federal level.&nbsp; This is obviously at a state level.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have anything to predict for you on that.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then a follow-up: Given his commitment to police reform, would he consider asking the DOJ to prohibit police departments that receive federal funds from using the Reid technique for interrogations?&nbsp; It&#8217;s considered to create a lot of false confessions.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, again, I know the Department of Justice has taken a number of steps, including on chokeholds and other actions that needed to be reformed in police departments across the country.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have anything to preview or predict in terms of additional steps.</p>



<p>The President supports their efforts to do more.&nbsp; Many of them have talked about their desire to do more.&nbsp; And obviously, we are continuing to consider an executive order on police reform here, given there has been an inability of Congress to move forward.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; There&#8217;s some pretty desperate images coming out of Shanghai right now, which is under lockdown for COVID &#8212; people begging for food and medicine.&nbsp; Is the White House monitoring that?&nbsp; Is there anything the U.S. can do to help the humanitarian situation there?&nbsp;</p>



<p>And also, on the supply chain front, is the administration aware of any further supply chain snags coming as a result of this?&nbsp; And how are you prepared to address them?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; Well, first, the &#8212; on the first part of your question, the State Department is closely monitoring the situation.&nbsp; They&#8217;re providing consistent updates of the situation on the ground.&nbsp; And we&#8217;ll certainly assess, with USAID and others, if there&#8217;s additional assistance that could be provided.</p>



<p>On the supply chain component: What we know is that the port is continuing to operate normally.&nbsp; And where we&#8217;re seeing the impacts &#8212; which still could have an impact over the course of time, of course &#8212; is factories, warehouses, and trucking, where we are seeing shutdowns within the region, which we know could cause delays, especially for air cargo, as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because this is just happening, we don&#8217;t have a prediction at this point on how that could impact bigger global supply chain issues.&nbsp; It depends on a lot of factors &#8212; how long, et cetera &#8212; but it is something we are closely monitoring, and it is something we will continue to work to &#8212; to address if it extends farther.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then just one more &#8212; housekeeping item.&nbsp; Do you have a timing update on when the President might sign the trade preference bill on Russia that passed?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;I don&#8217;t.&nbsp; And I know you and others have been looking for this.&nbsp; And let me see if I can get an answer before we all wrap up today.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, could you speak to the efficacy of sanctions?&nbsp; I know there was a new sanctions package rolled out this week.</p>



<p>And initially, we heard a lot from administration officials about this being a deterrent.&nbsp; I know that has changed.&nbsp; And so, can you speak to sort of the end goal and what is the efficacy of sanctions?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would say that it has &#8212; we have a couple of objectives at this point as it relates to the war in Ukraine.&nbsp; One is to impose severe consequences, send a marker for the world and for history about the horrific nature of these atrocities &#8212; these consequences.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And the second part of our objective is to ensure that these consequences are having a significant impact on the economy in Russia.&nbsp; We&#8217;re seeing an inflationary rate of about 15 percent &#8212; a projection of a contraction of 15 percent in the Russian economy.&nbsp; Six hundred private-sector companies have left Russia.&nbsp; We know it is having the impact that the world intended.&nbsp; This is the most significant coordinated set of sanctions ever done in history on this large of an economy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The third objective here is to make it much more difficult for President Putin to fund his war.&nbsp; And if you look back &#8212; say, earlier this week, at the example of the bond payments and how Russia has basically been put in a decision of &#8212; in a place where they either have to use their limited resources they have that are also being used to fund the war to prevent a default or default &#8212; that is the position they&#8217;re in at this point in time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But also, because we have cut them off, through export controls and a number of other means, from having access to materials and technology but also access to funds, it makes it more difficult for them to fund the war.&nbsp; That is part of it.</p>



<p>And the last objective is to continue to make it clear that this is a strategic blunder &#8212; their decision to invade Ukraine &#8212; and one that will make President Putin a pariah in the world.</p>



<p>So those are why and what we are hoping to achieve.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I ask one follow-up?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there anything being done in terms of either monitoring or actually just &#8212; I guess, monitoring to take a look at the effects of sanctions on ordinary Russians or anything the administration is thinking to just deal with that population of people who are being affected?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; The Russian people, you mean?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, correct.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Cert- &#8212; I mean, certainly, we are looking at how this is impacting the Russian economy writ large.&nbsp; And it is &#8212; certainly, as inflation is going up and as the economy is contracting, that means prices will go up.&nbsp; And we do know there will be a broad impact.&nbsp; That is the fault of President Putin, and the fault of President Putin invading a sovereign country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, it is important also for the Russian people to know and understand that.&nbsp; And we have been working through a range of means to communicate about the realities of the war and the facts of the war through Telegram, through YouTube, through a range of channels as well.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; General Milley, earlier this week, talked about the possibility of building permanent U.S. bases on NATO&#8217;s eastern flank.&nbsp; I wonder what seriousness the White House has given that &#8212; or, as you look long term at the war in Ukraine, whether shoring up the eastern flank with permanent bases is something that&#8217;s been considered.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; They&#8217;ll continue to be a range of discussions, but I have nothing beyond what General Milley said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I ask you one more question?&nbsp; I want to dig a little deeper on the French elections.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does the White House worry that the election of Le Pen could, you know, destabilize the NATO Alliance or make it difficult, being that she&#8217;s, you know, come up with pro-Russian statements?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I&#8217;m just not going to get ahead of an election in a foreign country.&nbsp; And obviously, we will watch it closely, and I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll have more to speak to once the results are concluded.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; What can you tell us about the multiple Secret Service agents who have been suspended or removed from the President, Vice President, and First Lady&#8217;s detail pending this investigation of two men impersonating officers of law enforcement?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Not much from here.&nbsp; I can point you to the Secret Service.&nbsp; And obviously, the FBI is overseeing the investigation.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there a broader concern in the administration that these principals &#8212; is there concern that they&#8217;re not being protected effectively?&nbsp; Is &#8212; can you speak at all to that?&nbsp; Or &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; As I said, yesterday, we &#8212; the President remains confident in the leader of the Secret Service.&nbsp; And beyond that, I would point you to the Secret Service and to the FBI.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, I guess, just on the invitations you issued to Republicans who voted to confirm Justice Jackson.&nbsp; I know one of them has COVID, but did you hear from the other two &#8212; Senator Murkowski and Romney?&nbsp; I know the President went a little further to talk about Senator Romney&#8217;s father today in his speech.&nbsp; Did the White House hear from the Republicans who were invited today?&nbsp; Why didn’t they come?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I would point you to their offices to speak to that.&nbsp; I mean, it doesn&#8217;t change the President&#8217;s gratitude to them for, you know, bucking the trend in their party of not supporting an <a></a></p>



<p>eminently qualified nominee.&nbsp; And they &#8212; they did that, and it was something he wanted to call out today and express his gratitude.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah, thank you, Jen.&nbsp; I&#8217;m wondering what the White House&#8217;s reaction is to yesterday&#8217;s U.N. vote to suspend Russia from the U.N. Human Rights Council &#8212; the fact that there were 58 nations that abstained from taking a vote and then on top of the other 24 nations that voted against it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although there was, you know, more &#8212; obviously, the majority of countries did vote to suspend Russia, do you think that this &#8212; you know, that many abstains &#8212; abstentions, that many people sitting on the sidelines of this shows that the entire world really isn&#8217;t unified around condemning these actions by Russia?<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, a win required two thirds present and voting, and that is exactly what happened, and far beyond that.&nbsp; And we know that there were abstentions.&nbsp; And only 24 countries, including North Korea, voted with Russia.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the outcome, which is what is most important to us, is what we wanted, which is Russia has been suspended from the U.N. Human Rights Council.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suspension &#8212; just so everybody knows; somebody asked me this question the other day &#8212; but it is the only method provided for in the U.N. resolution that established the Human Rights Council back in 2005 &#8212; is the most serious action available.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It&#8217;s only been applied once in history.&nbsp; This is only the second time in history that a country has been kicked out of the U.N. Human Rights Council.&nbsp; The last example was Libya.&nbsp; So that obviously speaks to the significance.&nbsp; And it also speaks to the fact that two thirds &#8212; more than two thirds of countries who are members are &#8212; believe that they should not have a leadership role on global human rights as they work to subvert and violate global human rights.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This also means that, once suspended, Russia will not be able to vote against future actions during subsequent Human Rights Council sessions.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so, to us, it is significant &#8212; only the secs [sic] time &#8212; second time in second time in history.&nbsp; And it speaks to the global outrage in response to these atrocities.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But are there any concerns that nearly 60 nations decided not to weigh in on this matter?<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Again, our focus is on the fact that it was a win.&nbsp; For only the second time in history was a country kicked out of &#8212; suspended from the U.N. Human Rights Council.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then one other question: Does President Biden still intend to attend the White House Correspondents Association dinner here later this month, in a couple of weeks?<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We haven&#8217;t announced his plans to attend or anything about his schedule, so I don&#8217;t have any update on that today.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All right.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Go ahead, Karen.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; Just some follow-ups to things that came up.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To follow up on Peter’s question about the testing cadence &#8212; you guys have told us about negative tests on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.&nbsp; Should we expect that the President would get tested on Sunday, two days later?<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I would say I don&#8217;t have a prediction of that.&nbsp; His doctor makes an assessment of when he should be tested and how often and what the cadence should be.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not always exactly the same.&nbsp; And &#8212; but we will provide information to you when he tests negative &#8212;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; &#8212; or either way, of course.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And to follow up on Katie&#8217;s question: Did the President talk to any of the senators &#8212; Romney, Murkowski, and Collins &#8212; after their vote yesterday on Ketanji Brown Jackson?<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have any update on that from here.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; And when he said he hoped he didn&#8217;t get them in trouble today when he referenced them, what did he mean by that?<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; He meant he recognizes that the vast majority of the other members of their party voted a different way.</p>



<p>Go ahead.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; On India: Next week, Secretary of State Blinken and Defense Secretary are hosting their Indian counterparts &#8212; External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh &#8212; for the first India-U.S. 2+2 dialogue under this administration.&nbsp; What is President’s message to the meeting?&nbsp; What is his expectations?&nbsp; Is he sending any concrete ideas to this meeting as well?<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; President Biden believes our partnership with India is one of the most important relationships we have in the world.&nbsp; As you know, he met with Presi- &#8212; Prime Minister Modi and other Quad leaders in March.&nbsp; He expects that at this 2+2, Secretary Blinken and Secretary Austin will continue driving forward our work with India and our shared goals in the Indo-Pacific region and around the world.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We also believe both sides will continue our close consultations on the consequences of President Putin&#8217;s brutal war against Ukraine and mitigating the impact by addressing energy and food prices.&nbsp; Obviously, it could cover a range of topics, but we expect that to be a central one.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And secondly, given the U.S.’s frustrating experience having the U.N. Security Council (inaudible) coming out and doing all they should do with Ukraine, what is President’s thoughts on the reforms to the U.N. Security Council itself?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I know a question has been asked about whether Russia could be kicked out of being a permanent member; we don&#8217;t anticipate that happening.&nbsp; But obviously, the step taken yesterday to suspend Russia from the U.N. Human Rights Council is an indication of the global response and horror at the atrocities we&#8217;ve seen happen on the ground in Ukraine.&nbsp; But beyond that, I don&#8217;t have any other predictions of reforms.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Should there be individual veto or group veto inside the Security Council?<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Again, I understand your questions, but I don&#8217;t have any predictions or calls for that at this point.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go ahead, Francesca.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Okay, we&#8217;ll just do a few more.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go ahead.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; Since his State of the Union Address, the President has only made a handful of domestic trips.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve talked in here before about how he&#8217;d like to get back into the community and have a chance to interact with the American people.&nbsp; Is the current COVID wave getting in the way of his travel plans?<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; No.&nbsp; I expect he&#8217;s going to travel a bunch in the next few weeks.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; And you had mentioned that you will be going to North Carolina and you didn&#8217;t have too much more to add on that.&nbsp; But might the President, while he&#8217;s in Greensboro, be visiting one of the area’s two Historically Black Colleges and Universities?<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have more details at this point in time.&nbsp; As they get finalized, I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll share them with all of you.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go ahead.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; I have a two-part question on student loans.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yep.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last year, President Biden directed the Department of Education to create a report on whether he has presidential authority to unilaterally do a broad cancellation of debt.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t believe that&#8217;s ever been made public.&nbsp; And as you&#8217;re looking at loan extensions &#8212; or loan pause extensions, will we &#8212; can we anticipate seeing a release of that report?<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And secondly, as &#8212; you&#8217;ve talked about how the President wants to lower costs for Americans.&nbsp; Borrowers have expressed stress, anxiety about these short-term extensions.&nbsp; What&#8217;s your message to them?<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I think our message to them is that not a single person has paid a dime on their student loans since the President took office.&nbsp; And he&#8217;s continued to evaluate and assess with the Department of Education and other policymakers in the administration what the needs are to lower costs for people, including people who have student loans and are &#8212; do feel stressed, even as the economy is continuing to recover but as we see costs too high in some areas.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the first question, I don&#8217;t have any update on that.&nbsp; I would tell you that if Congress were to send him a bill to cancel $10,000 in student loans &#8212; in student debt, he&#8217;d be happy to sign it.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go ahead.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last one.&nbsp; Last one.&nbsp; Last one.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go ahead.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Well, Rachel Wallace, who was the general counsel of the science office who the White House found had been bullied by Dr. Lander, has been told that she will not be getting her job back as general counsel.&nbsp; Why?<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I am not aware of this personnel update.&nbsp; I&#8217;d have to check on it.&nbsp; I&#8217;m happy to do that.&nbsp; And we will get you back a comment.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Then a follow-up: Yesterday, you said &#8212; when asked about Vice President Harris and the mask at the Senate &#8212; you said that she would follow CDC protocols at the event today.&nbsp; CDC protocols clearly say you should be wearing a mask.&nbsp; It doesn&#8217;t distinguish between outside and inside.&nbsp; So why didn&#8217;t she wear a mask?<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; And she was socially distanced for the vast majority of the event today.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was sitting &#8212; standing next to the President.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; About six feet away.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, everyone.&nbsp; Thank you, everyone.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">South Lawn</p>



<p>12:33 P.M. EDT</p>



<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Good morning.&nbsp; Good morning.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Good morning, America.&nbsp; (Laughs.)&nbsp; Have a seat, please.&nbsp;</p>



<p>President Joe Biden, First Lady Dr. Jill Biden, Second Gentleman Douglas Emhoff, members of Congress, members of the Cabinet, members of our administration, and friends and fellow Americans: Today is, indeed, a wonderful day &#8212; (applause) &#8212; as we gather to celebrate the confirmation of the next justice of the United States Supreme Court, Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>President George Washington once referred to America as a “great experiment” &#8212; a nation founded on the previously untested belief that the people &#8212; we, the people &#8212; could form a more perfect union.  And that belief has pushed our nation forward for generations.  And it is that belief that we reaffirmed yesterday &#8212; (applause) &#8212; through the confirmation of the first Black woman to the United States Supreme Court.  (Applause.)</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Whoa!&nbsp; It’s about time!&nbsp;</p>



<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; And, Judge Jackson, you will inspire generations of leaders.&nbsp; They will watch your confirmation hearings and read your decisions.</p>



<p>In the years to come, the Court will answer fundamental questions about who we are and what kind of country we live in: Will we expand opportunity or restrict it?&nbsp; Will we strengthen the foundations of our great democracy or let them crumble?&nbsp; Will we move forward or backward?</p>



<p>The young leaders of our nation will learn from the experience, the judgment, the wisdom that you, Judge Jackson, will apply in every case that comes before you.&nbsp; And they will see, for the first time, four women sitting on that Court at one time.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, as a point of personal privilege, I will share with you, Judge Jackson, that when I presided over the Senate confirmation vote yesterday, while I was sitting there, I drafted a note to my goddaughter.&nbsp; And I told her that I felt such a deep sense of pride and joy and about what this moment means for our nation and for her future.&nbsp; And I will tell you, her braids are just a little longer than yours.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>But as I wrote to her, I told her what I knew this would mean for her life and all that she has in terms of potential.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, indeed, the road toward our more perfect union is not always straight, and it is not always smooth.&nbsp; But sometimes it leads to a day like today &#8212; (applause) &#8212; a day that reminds us what is possible &#8212; what is possible when progress is made and that the journey &#8212; well, it will always be worth it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So let us not forget that, as we celebrate this day, we are also here in great part because of one President, Joe Biden &#8212; (applause) &#8212; and &#8212; (laughs) &#8212; and because of Joe Biden&#8217;s vision and leadership and commitment &#8212; a lifelong commitment &#8212; to building a better America.</p>



<p>And, of course, we are also here because of the voices and the support of so many others, many of whom are in this audience today.</p>



<p>And with that, it is now my extreme and great honor to introduce our President, Joe Biden.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Thank you, Kamala.&nbsp; Thank you, thank you, thank you.&nbsp; The first really smart decision I made in this administration.&nbsp; (Laughter.)</p>



<p>My name is Joe Biden.&nbsp; Please, sit down.&nbsp; I’m Jill’s husband &#8212; (laughter) &#8212;&nbsp;and Naomi Biden’s grandfather.</p>



<p>And, folks, you know, yesterday &#8212; this is not only a sunny day.&nbsp; I mean this from the bottom of my heart: This is going to let so much shine &#8212; sun shine on so many young women, so many young Black women &#8212; (applause) &#8212; so many minorities, that it’s real.&nbsp; It’s real.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’re going to look back &#8212; nothing to do with me &#8212; we’re going to look back and see this as a moment of real change in American history.</p>



<p>I was on the phone this morning, Jesse, with President Ramaphosa of South Africa.&nbsp; And he was talking about how &#8212; the time that I was so outspoken about what was going on and my meeting with Nelson Mandela here.&nbsp; And I said, “You know” &#8212; I said, “I’m shortly going to go out,” look- &#8212; I’m looking out the window &#8212; “I’m going to go out in this &#8212; what they call the South Lawn of the White House, and I’m going to introduce to the world &#8212; to the world &#8212; the first African American woman out of over 200 judges on the Supreme Court.”&nbsp; And he said to me &#8212; he said, “Keep it up.”&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; “Keep it up.”&nbsp; (Applause.) We’re going to keep it up.</p>



<p>And, folks, yesterday we all witnessed a truly historic moment presided over by the Vice President.&nbsp; There are moments, if people go back in history, and they&#8217;re literally historic, consequential, fundamental shifts in American policy.</p>



<p>Today, we’re joined by the First Lady, the Second Gentleman, and members of the Cabinet, the Senate Majority Leader.&nbsp; Where &#8212; there you are, Chuck.&nbsp; The Senate Majority Leader.&nbsp; And so many who made this possible.</p>



<p>But &#8212; and today is a good day, a day that history is going to remember.&nbsp; And in the years to come, they’re going to be proud of what we did, and which (inaudible) &#8212; Dick Durbin did as the chairman of the committee.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; I’m serious, Dick.&nbsp; I’m deadly earnest when I say that.</p>



<p>To turn to our children and grandchildren and say, “I was there.”&nbsp; “I was there.”&nbsp; That &#8212; this is one of those moments, in my view.</p>



<p>My fellow Americans, today I’m honored to officially introduce to you the next Associate Justice of the Supreme Court&nbsp;of the United States, Ketanji Brown Jackson.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>After more than 20 hours of questioning at her hearing and nearly 100 meetings &#8212; she made herself available to every single senator who wanted to speak to her and spoke for more than just a few minutes, answered their questions, in private as well as before the committee &#8212; we all saw the kind of justice she’ll be: Fair and impartial.&nbsp; Thoughtful.&nbsp; Careful.&nbsp; Precise.&nbsp; Precise.&nbsp; Brilliant. &nbsp;A brilliant legal mind with deep knowledge of the law.&nbsp; And a judicial temperament &#8212; which was equally important, in my view &#8212; that’s calm and in command.&nbsp; And a humility that allows so many Americans&nbsp;to see themselves in Ketanji Brown Jackson.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That brings a rare combination of expertise and qualifications to the Court.&nbsp; A federal judge who has served on the second most powerful court in America behind the Supreme Court.&nbsp; A former federal public defender with the &#8212; (applause) &#8212; with the ability to explain complicated issues in the law&nbsp;in ways everybody &#8212; all people &#8212; can understand.&nbsp; A new perspective.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When I made the commitment to nominate a Black woman to the Supreme Court, I could see this day.&nbsp; I literally could see this day, because I thought about it for a long, long time.&nbsp; As Jill and Naomi would tell you, I wasn’t going to run again.&nbsp; But when I decided to run, this was one of the first decisions I made.&nbsp; I could see it.&nbsp; I could see it as a day of hope, a day of promise, a day of progress; a day&nbsp;when, once again, the moral arc of the universe, as Barack used to quote all the time, bends just a little more toward justice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I knew it wouldn’t be easy, but I knew the person I nominated would be put through a painful and difficult confirmation process.&nbsp; But I have to tell you, what Judge Jackson was put through was well beyond that.&nbsp; There was verbal abuse.&nbsp; The anger.&nbsp; The constant interruptions.&nbsp; The most vile, baseless assertions and accusations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the face of it all, Judge Jackson showed the incredible character and integrity she possesses.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Poise.&nbsp; Poise and composure.&nbsp; Patience and restraint.&nbsp; And, yes, perseverance and even joy.&nbsp; (Applause.) &nbsp;Even joy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ketanji &#8212; or I can’t &#8212; I’m not going to be calling you that in public anymore.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Judge, you are the very definition of what we Irish refer to as dignity.&nbsp; You have enormous dignity.&nbsp; And it communicates to people.&nbsp; It’s contagious.&nbsp; And it matters.&nbsp; It matters a lot.</p>



<p>Maybe that’s not surprising if you looked to who sat behind her during those hearings &#8212; her husband Dr. Patrick Jackson and his family.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Patrick, stand up, man.&nbsp; Stand up.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Talia and Leila, stand up.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; I know it’s embarrassing the girls.&nbsp; I’m going to tell you what Talia said.&nbsp; I said to Talia, “It’s hard being the daughter or the son of a famous person.”&nbsp; I said, “Imagine what it’s like being President.”&nbsp; And he said &#8212; she said, “She may be.”&nbsp; (Laughter and applause.)&nbsp; I couldn’t agree more.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Thank you, thank you, thank you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And Ketajh, her brother, a former police officer and a veteran.&nbsp; Ketajh, stand up, man.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; This a man who looks like he can still play, buddy. &nbsp;He’s got biceps about as big as my calves.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Thank you, bud.&nbsp; Thank you, thank you, thank you.</p>



<p>And, of course, her parents: Johnny and Ellery Brown.&nbsp; Johnny and Ellery, stand up.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; I tell you what &#8212; as I told Mom: Moms rule in my house.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; No, you think I’m kidding.&nbsp; I’m not.&nbsp; My mom and my wife as well.</p>



<p>Look, people of deep faith, with a deep love of family and country &#8212; that’s what you represent; who know firsthand, Mom and Dad, the indignity of Jim Crow, the inhumanity of legal segregation, and you had overcome so much in your own lives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You saw the strength of parents in the strength of their daughter that is just worth celebrating.&nbsp; I can’t get over, Mom and Dad &#8212; you know, I mean, what &#8212; what you did, and your faith, and never giving up any hope.&nbsp; And both that wonderful son you have and your daughter.</p>



<p>You know, and that strength lifted up millions of Americans who watched you, Judge Jackson, especially women and women of color who have had to run the gauntlet in their own lives.&nbsp; So many of my Cabinet members are women &#8212; women of color, women that represent every sector of the community.&nbsp; And it matters.&nbsp; And you stood up for them as well.&nbsp; They know it &#8212; everybody out there, every woman out there, everyone &#8212; (applause) &#8212; am I correct?&nbsp; Just like they have.&nbsp; Just like they have.</p>



<p>And same with the women members of Congress, as well, across the board.</p>



<p>Look, it’s a powerful thing when people can see themselves in others.&nbsp; Think about that.&nbsp; What’s the most powerful thing &#8212; I’ll bet every one of you can go back and think of a time in your life where there was a teacher, a family member, a neighbor &#8212; somebody &#8212; somebody who made you believe that you could be whatever you wanted to be.&nbsp; It’s a powerful, powerful, powerful notion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And that’s one of the reasons I believed so strongly that we needed a Court that looks like America.&nbsp; Not just the Supreme Court.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s why I’m proud to say, with the great help of Dick Durbin, I’ve nominated more Black women judges to the federal appeal courts than all previous presidents combined.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Combined.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And that’s why I’m proud that Kamala Harris is our Vice President of the United States.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; A brilliant lawyer.&nbsp; The Attorney General of the State of California.&nbsp; Former member of the Senate Judiciary Committee.&nbsp; Kamala was invaluable during this entire process.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>And, Chuck, our Majority Leader, I want to thank you, pal.&nbsp; You did a masterful job in keeping the caucus together, &nbsp;getting this vote across the finish line in a timely and historic manner.&nbsp; Just watching it on television yesterday, watching when the vote was taken &#8212; and the Democratic side, they&#8217;re brave people &#8212; there was such enthusiasm, genuine.&nbsp; You can tell when it’s real.&nbsp; You can tell when it’s real.&nbsp; You did an incredible job, Chuck.&nbsp; Thank you so much.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Folks, because you’re all able to sit down and don’t have to stand, I’m going to go on a little longer here and tell you &#8212; (laughter) &#8212; I want to say something about Dick Durbin again.&nbsp; Dick, I’m telling you, overseeing the hearing, how you executed the strategy by the hour, every day, to keep the committee together.&nbsp; And you have a very divided committee with some of the most conservative members of the Senate on that committee.&nbsp; It was especially difficult with an evenly divided Senate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dick, I served as chairman of that committee for a number of years before I had this job and the job of Vice President.&nbsp; As did all the Democrats, you did an outstanding &#8212; I think all the Democrats in the committee did and every Democrat in the Senate, all of whom voted for Judge Jackson.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And notwithstanding the harassment and attacks in the hearings, I always believed that a bipartisan vote was possible.&nbsp; And I hope I don’t get him in trouble &#8212; I mean it sincerely &#8212; but I want to thank three Republicans who voted for Judge Jackson.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Senators Collins, who’s a woman of integrity.&nbsp; Senator Murkowski, the same way &#8212; in Alaska &#8212; and up for reelection.&nbsp; And Mitt Romney, whose dad stood up like he did.&nbsp; His dad stood up and made these decisions on civil rights.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They deserve enormous credit for setting aside partisanship and making a carefully considered judgment based on the Judge’s character, qualifications, and independence.&nbsp; And I truly admire the respect, diligence, and hard work they demonstrated in the course of the process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As someone who has overseen, they tell me, more Supreme Court nominations than anyone who’s alive today, I believe that respect for the process is important.&nbsp; And that’s why it was so important to me to meet the constitutional requirement&nbsp;to seek the advice and the consent of the Senate.&nbsp; The advice beforehand and the consent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Judge Jackson started the nominating process&nbsp;with an imper- &#8212; an impressive range of support: from the FOP to civil rights leaders; even Republican-appointed judges came forward.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In fact, Judge Jackson was introduced at the hearing by Judge Thomas Griffith, the distinguished retired judge appointed by George W. Bush.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She finished the hearing with among the highest levels of support of the American people of any nomination in recent memory.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>So, soon, Judge Jackson will join the United States Supreme Court.&nbsp; And like every justice, the decisions she makes will impact on the lives of America for a lot longer, in many cases, than any laws we all make.&nbsp; But the truth is: She’s already impacting the lives of so many Americans.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During the hearing, Dick spoke about a custodial worker who works the night shift at the Capitol.&nbsp; Her name is Verona Clemmons.&nbsp; Verona, where are you?&nbsp; Stand up, Verona.&nbsp; I want to &#8212; (applause) &#8212; if you don’t mind.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She told him what this nomination meant to her.&nbsp; So he invited Ms. Clemmons to attend the hearing because she wanted to see, hear, and stand by Judge Jackson.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thank you, Verona.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Thank you, thank you, thank you.</p>



<p>At her meeting with Judge Jackson, Senator Duckworth introduced her to 11-year-old &#8212; is it Vivian?&nbsp;</p>



<p>AUDIENCE MEMBER:&nbsp; Vivienne.</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; <em>Vi-vinne</em>?&nbsp;</p>



<p>AUDIENCE MEMBER:&nbsp; Vivienne.&nbsp;</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Vivienne.&nbsp; I&#8217;m sorry, Vivienne.&nbsp; There &#8212; that’s her &#8212; that’s your sister.&nbsp; He&#8217;s point- &#8212; (laughter) &#8212; who was so inspired by the hearing that she wants to be a Supreme Court justice&nbsp;when she grows up.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; God love you.&nbsp; Stand up, honey.&nbsp; Am I going to embarrass you if I just ask you to stand up?&nbsp; Come on, stand.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>There&#8217;s tens of thousands of Viviennes all through the entire United States.&nbsp; She met Judge Jackson and saw her future.&nbsp; Vivienne, you&#8217;re here today, and thank you for coming, honey.&nbsp; I know I embarrassed you by introducing you, but thank you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>People of every generation, of every race, of every background felt this moment, and they feel it now.&nbsp; They feel a sense of pride and hope, of belonging and believing, and knowing the promise of America includes everybody &#8212; all of us.&nbsp; And that’s the American experiment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Justice Breyer talked about it when he came to the White House in January to announce his retirement from the Court.  He used to technically work with me when I was on the Judiciary Committee, and that’s before he became a justice.  He&#8217;s a man of great integrity.  We’re going to miss Justice Breyer.  He’s a patriot, an extraordinary public <s>service</s> [servant], and a great justice of the Supreme Court.</p>



<p>And, folks &#8212; (applause) &#8212; let me close with what I’ve long said: America is a nation that can be defined in a single word.&nbsp; I was in the foothi- &#8212; foot- &#8212; excuse me, in the foothills of the Himalayas with Xi Jinping, traveling with him.&nbsp; (Inaudible) traveled 17,000 miles when I was Vice President at the time. &nbsp;I don&#8217;t know that for a fact.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And we were sitting alone.&nbsp; I had an interpreter and he had an interpreter.&nbsp; And he looked at me.&nbsp; In all seriousness, he said, “Can you define America for me?”&nbsp; And I said what many of you heard me say for a long time.&nbsp; I said, “Yes, I can, in one word: possibilities.”&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; “Possibilities.”&nbsp; That, in America, everyone should be able to go as far as their hard work and God-given talent will take them.&nbsp; And possibilities.&nbsp; We’re the only ones.&nbsp; That’s why we’re viewed as the “ugly Americans”: We think anything is possible.&nbsp; (Laughter.) &nbsp;</p>



<p>And the idea that a young girl who was dissuaded from even thinking you should apply to Harvard Law School &#8212; “Don’t raise your hopes so high.”&nbsp; Well, I don’t know who told you that, but I&#8217;d like to go back and invite her to the Supreme Court so she can see the interior.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Look, even Supreme Court of the United States of America.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, folks, it’s my honor &#8212; and it truly is an honor; I&#8217;ve been looking forward to it for a while &#8212; to introduce to you the next Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court, the Honorable Ketanji Brown Jackson.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>JUDGE JACKSON:&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Thank you all.&nbsp; Thank you, all, very much.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thank you so much, Mr. President.&nbsp; It is the greatest honor of my life to be here with you at this moment, standing before my wonderful family, many of my close friends, your distinguished staff and guests, and the American people.</p>



<p>Over these past few weeks, you’ve heard a lot from me and about me, so I hope to use this time primarily to do something that I have not had sufficient time to do, which is to extend my heartfelt thanks to the many, many people who have helped me as part of this incredible journey.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I have quite a few people to thank.&nbsp; And &#8212; and as I&#8217;m sure you can imagine, in this moment, it is hard to find the words to express the depth of my gratitude.&nbsp;</p>



<p>First, as always, I have to give thanks to God for delivering me as promised &#8212; (applause) &#8212; and for sustaining me throughout this nomination and confirmation process.&nbsp; As I said at the outset, I have come this far by faith, and I know that I am truly blessed.&nbsp; To the many people who have lifted me up in prayer since the nomination, thank you.&nbsp; I am very grateful.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thank you, as well, Mr. President, for believing in me and for honoring me with this extraordinary chance to serve our country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thank you also, Madam Vice President, for your wise counsel and steady guidance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And thank you to the First Lady and the Second Gentleman for the care and warmth that you have shown me and my family.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I would also like to extend my thanks to each member of the Senate.&nbsp; You have fulfilled the important constitutional role of providing advice and consent under the leadership of Majority Leader Schumer.&nbsp; And I&#8217;m especially grateful for the work of the members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, under Chairman Durbin&#8217;s skillful leadership.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>As you may have heard, during the confirmation process, I had the distinct honor of having 95 personal meetings with 97 sitting senators.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; And we had substantive and engaging conversations about my approach to judging and about the role of judges in the constitutional system we all love.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a brief aside, I will note that these are subjects about which I care deeply.&nbsp; I have dedicated my career to public service because I love this country and our Constitution and the rights that make us free.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I also understand from my many years of practice as a legal advocate, as a trial judge, and as a judge on a court of appeals that part of the genius of the constitutional framework of the United States is its design, and that the framers entrusted the judicial branch with the crucial but limited role.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve also spent the better part of the past decade hearing thousands of cases and writing hundreds of opinions.&nbsp; And in every instance, I have done my level best to stay in my lane and to reach a result that is consistent with my understanding of the law and with the obligation to rule independently without fear or favor.</p>



<p>I am humbled and honored to continue in this fashion as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, working with brilliant colleagues, supporting and defending the Constitution, and steadfastly upholding the rule of law.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>But today, at this podium, my mission is far more modest. I&#8217;m simply here to give my heartfelt thanks to the categories of folks who are largely responsible for me being here at this moment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>First, of course, there is my family.&nbsp; Mom and Dad, thank you not only for traveling back here on what seems like a mos- &#8212; moment’s notice, but for everything you’ve done and continue to do for me.&nbsp;</p>



<p>My brother, Ketajh, is here as well.&nbsp; You’ve always been an inspiration to me as a model of public service and bravery, and I thank you for that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I love you all very much.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>To my in-laws, Pamela and Gardner Jackson, who are here today, and my sisters-in-law and brothers-in-law, William and Dana, Gardie and Natalie: Thank you for your love and support.</p>



<p>To my daughters, Talia and Leila: I bet you never thought you’d get to skip school by spending a day at the White House.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; This is all pretty exciting for me as well.&nbsp; But nothing has brought me greater joy than being your mother.&nbsp; I love you very much.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>Patrick, thank you for everything you’ve done for me over these past 25 years of our marriage.&nbsp; You’ve done everything to support and encourage me.&nbsp; And it is you who’ve made this moment possible.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Your &#8212; your steadfast love gave me the courage to move in this direction.&nbsp; I don’t know that I believed you when you said that I could do this, but now I do.&nbsp; (Laughter and applause.)&nbsp; And for that, I am forever grateful.</p>



<p>In the family category, let me also briefly mention the huge extended family, both Patrick’s and my own, who are watching this from all over the country and the world. &nbsp;Thank you for supporting me.&nbsp; I hope to be able to connect with you personally in the coming weeks and months.</p>



<p>Moving on briefly to the second category of people that warrant special recognition: those who provided invaluable support to me professionally in the decades prior to my nomination, and the many, many friends I have been privileged to make throughout my life and career.</p>



<p>Now, I know that everyone who finds professional success thinks they have the best mentors, but I truly do.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; I have three inspiring jurists for whom I had the privilege of clerking: Judge Patti Saris, Judge Bruce Selya, and, of course, Justice Stephen Breyer. &nbsp;Each of them is an exceptional public servant, and I could not have had better role models for thoughtfulness, integrity, honor, and principle, both by word and deed.</p>



<p>My clerkship with Justice Breyer, in particular, was an extraordinary gift and one for which I&#8217;ve only become more grateful with each passing year.&nbsp; Justice Breyer’s commitment to an independent, impartial judiciary is unflagging.&nbsp; And, for him, the rule of law is not merely a duty, it is his passion.&nbsp; I am daunted by the prospect of having to follow in his footsteps.&nbsp; And I would count myself lucky, indeed, to be able to do so with even the smallest amount of his wisdom, grace, and joy.</p>



<p>The exceptional mentorship of the judges for whom I clerked has proven especially significant for me during this past decade of my service as a federal judge.&nbsp; And, of course, that service itself has been a unique opportunity.&nbsp; For that, I must also thank President Obama, who put his faith in me by nominating me to my first judicial role on the federal district court.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>This brings me to my colleagues and staff of the federal district court in Washington, D.C., and the D.C. Circuit: Thank you for everything.&nbsp; I am deeply grateful for your wisdom and your battle-tested friendship through the years.</p>



<p>I also want to extend a special thanks to all of my law clerks, many of whom are here today, who have carved out time and space to accompany me on this professional journey.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I&#8217;m especially grateful to Jennifer Gruda, who has been by my side since nearly the outset of my time on the bench &#8212; (applause) &#8212; and has promised &#8212; has promised not to leave me as we take this last big step.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To the many other friends that I have had the great, good fortune to have made throughout the years &#8212; from my neighborhood growing up; from Miami Palmetto Senior High School, and especially the debate team; from my days at Harvard College, where I met my indefatigable and beloved roommates, Lisa Fairfax, Nina Coleman Simmons, and Antoinette Sequeira Coakley &#8212; they are truly my sisters.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>To my time at Harvard Law School and the many professional experiences that I&#8217;ve been blessed to have since graduation: Thank you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I have too many friends to name, but please know how much you’ve meant to me and how much I have appreciated the smiles, the hugs, and the many “atta girls” that have propelled me forward to this day.</p>



<p>Finally, I&#8217;d like to give special thanks to the White House staff and the special assistants who provided invaluable assistance in helping me to navigate the confirmation process.</p>



<p>My trusted sherpa, Senator Doug Jones, was an absolute godsend.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; He was an absolute godsend.&nbsp; He&#8217;s not only the best storyteller you&#8217;d ever want to meet, but also unbelievably popular on the Hill, which helped a lot.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>I&#8217;m also standing here today in no small part due to the hard work of the brilliant folks who interact with the legislature and other stakeholders on behalf of the White House, including Louisa Terrell, Reema Dodin, and Tona Boyd, Minyon Moore, Ben LaBolt, and Andrew Bates.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>I am also particularly grateful for the awe-inspiring leadership of White House Counsel Dana Remus.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Of Paige Herwig. &nbsp;Where is Paige?&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; And Ron Klain.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>They led an extraordinarily talented team of White House staffers in the Herculean effort that was required to ensure that I was well prepared for the rigors of this process and in record time.&nbsp; Thank you all.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thank you, as well, to the many, many kind-hearted people from all over this country and around the world who’ve reached out to me directly in recent weeks with messages of support.</p>



<p>I have spent years toiling away in the relative solitude of my chambers, with just my law clerks, in isolation. &nbsp;So, it&#8217;s been somewhat overwhelming, in a good way, to recently be flooded with thousands of notes and cards and photos expressing just how much this moment means to so many people.</p>



<p>The notes that I&#8217;ve received from children are particularly cute and especially meaningful because, more than anything, they speak directly to the hope and promise of America.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It has taken 232 years and 115 prior appointments for a Black woman to be selected to serve on the Supreme Court of the United States.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>But we&#8217;ve made it.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; We&#8217;ve made it, all of us.&nbsp; All of us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And &#8212; and our children are telling me that they see now, more than ever, that, here in America, anything is possible.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>They also tell me that I&#8217;m a role model, which I take both as an opportunity and as a huge responsibility.&nbsp; I am feeling up to the task, primarily because I know that I am not alone.&nbsp; I am standing on the shoulders of my own role models, generations of Americans who never had anything close to this kind of opportunity but who got up every day and went to work believing in the promise of America, showing others through their determination and, yes, their perseverance that good &#8212; good things can be done in this great country &#8212; from my grandparents on both sides who had only a grade-school education but instilled in my parents the importance of learning, to my parents who went to racially segregated schools growing up and were the first in their families to have the chance to go to college.</p>



<p>I am also ever buoyed by the leadership of generations past who helped to light the way: Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Justice Thurgood Marshall, and my personal heroine, Judge Constance Baker Motley.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>They, and so many others, did the heavy lifting that made this day possible.&nbsp; And for all of the talk of this historic nomination and now confirmation, I think of them as the true pathbreakers.&nbsp; I am just the very lucky first inheritor of the dream of liberty and justice for all.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>To be sure, I have worked hard to get to this point in my career, and I have now achieved something far beyond anything my grandparents could’ve possibly ever imagined.&nbsp; But no one does this on their own.&nbsp; The path was cleared for me so that I might rise to this occasion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And in the poetic words of Dr. Maya Angelou, I do so now, while “bringing the gifts…my ancestors gave.” &nbsp;(Applause.)&nbsp; I &#8211;“I am the dream and the hope of the slave.”&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>So as I take on this new role, I strongly believe that this is a moment in which all Americans can take great pride.</p>



<p>We have come a long way toward perfecting our union.</p>



<p>In my family, it took just one generation to go from segregation to the Supreme Court of the United States.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>And it is an honor &#8212; the honor of a lifetime &#8212; for me to have this chance to join the Court, to promote the rule of law at the highest level, and to do my part to carry our shared project of democracy and equal justice under law forward, into the future.</p>



<p>Thank you, again, Mr. President and members of the Senate for this incredible honor.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;</p>

<p>Since the outset of my administration, the United States has placed the highest priority on delivering critical military capabilities to Ukraine so it can defend itself against Russian aggression. The entire world has now witnessed the effectiveness of those weapons, as courageous Ukrainian forces have used them to repel the Russian attack on Kyiv, keep the skies of Ukraine contested, and deliver severe blows to the Russian military.</p>



<p>In addition to U.S.-produced weapons, we have also worked to facilitate the transfer of capabilities from our Allies and partners around the world. I want to thank the Slovakian government for providing an S-300 air defense system to Ukraine, something President Zelenskyy has personally raised with me in our conversations. To enable this transfer and ensure the continued security of Slovakia, the United States will reposition a U.S. Patriot missile system to Slovakia.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now is no time for complacency. The Russian military may have&nbsp;failed in its objective of capturing Kyiv, but it continues to inflict horrific acts of brutality on the Ukrainian people. As the Russian military repositions for the next phase of this war, I have directed my Administration to continue to spare no effort to identify and provide to the Ukrainian military the advanced weapons capabilities it needs to defend its country.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On April 9, 1942, tens of thousands of American and Filipino prisoners of war began what would become known to history as the Bataan Death March.&nbsp; Thousands died during the march, but the indomitable spirit of those prisoners was never broken.&nbsp; Eighty years later, our Nation continues to honor their courage and recognize the more than half a million service members who sacrificed their own freedom as prisoners of war to&nbsp;ensure that our Nation and the values of freedom and democracy always prevail.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Former prisoners of war stand among the bravest of our Nation.&nbsp; They fought valiantly and served with honor &#8212; and under often agonizing conditions as prisoners, they demonstrated incredible personal courage, love of country, and devotion to duty.&nbsp; Through their extraordinary sacrifices and selflessness, they helped ensure freedom for millions of people.&nbsp; They are heroes.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I join all Americans in expressing our deepest gratitude to&nbsp;every service member who has endured being a prisoner of war and to their families, caregivers, and survivors. &nbsp;Their service &#8212; knowing all the risk and danger it could bring &#8212; is a credit to&nbsp;their character and to our Nation. &nbsp;On this day and every day, we remember the hardships of captivity they survived in service to our Nation. &nbsp;We also remember all the brave women and men who&nbsp;died as prisoners in foreign lands during our Nation&#8217;s past wars, and we grieve with those at home who prayed for their loved ones&#8217; return.&nbsp; Their faith, love of family, and devotion to our Nation inspire us all, and we will always remember their sacrifices.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, our brave men and women in uniform carry on the rich legacy of our former prisoners of war &#8212; unrelenting in battle, unwavering in loyalty, unmatched in decency, and prepared to&nbsp;make the ultimate sacrifice on behalf of our Nation.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May God bless our former prisoners of war and their families, and may God protect our troops.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 9, 2022, as National Former Prisoner of War Recognition Day.&nbsp; I call upon Americans to observe this day by honoring the service and sacrifice of all former prisoners of&nbsp;war as our Nation expresses its eternal gratitude for their sacrifice.&nbsp; I also call upon Federal, State, and local government officials and organizations to observe this day with&nbsp;appropriate ceremonies and activities.</p>



<p>     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighth day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-sixth.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-right">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.</p>

<p>Pregnancy and childbirth should be a dignified, safe, and joyful experience for all.&nbsp;&nbsp;For far too many mothers, however, complications related to pregnancy, childbirth, and postpartum can lead to devastating health outcomes &#8212; including hundreds of&nbsp;deaths each year.&nbsp;&nbsp;This maternal health crisis is particularly devastating for Black women, who are more than three times as likely to die from pregnancy-related complications as white women, regardless of their income or education.&nbsp;&nbsp;During Black Maternal Health Week, we renew our commitment to addressing the crisis of Black maternal mortality and morbidity across the country.<br><br>The Biden-Harris Administration remains fully committed to&nbsp;ameliorating these unacceptable disparities and building a&nbsp;health care system that is equitable and safe for Black families.&nbsp;&nbsp;The inequities that Black mothers face are not isolated incidents but, rather, the byproduct of systemic racism in our society that has festered for far too long.&nbsp;&nbsp;To root it out, and improve health outcomes, we must address a broad range of areas where unequal access persists along racial lines &#8212; including access to health care, adequate nutrition and housing, toxin-free environments, high-paying job sectors that provide paid leave, and workplaces free from harassment and discrimination.<br><br>That is why the American Rescue Plan gives States the opportunity to provide 12 months of extended postpartum coverage to pregnant people enrolled in Medicaid and the Children&#8217;s Health Insurance Program.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also why I signed the Protecting Moms Who Served Act &#8212; part of the Black Maternal Health &#8220;Momnibus&#8221; Act that Vice President Harris introduced in&nbsp;the Senate &#8212; to address the maternal challenges that women veterans face.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is why Vice President Harris hosted the first-ever White House Maternal Day of Action Summit and announced a nationwide call to action to reduce maternal mortality and morbidity.<br><br>To improve perinatal health outcomes and maternal health equity, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services intends to propose the first-ever hospital quality designation specifically focused on maternity care.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration recently accepted applications for the Services Grant Program for Residential Treatment for Pregnant and Postpartum Women &#8212; a program that provides pregnant and postpartum women and their children with comprehensive substance use treatment and recovery support services across residential and outpatient settings.&nbsp;&nbsp;This year, the program will also extend services to fathers, partners, and other family members.<br><br>In the year ahead, we must build on this work by further expanding access to maternal care, lowering health care costs, and making new investments to drive down mortality and improve maternal health.&nbsp;&nbsp;We are going to expand and diversify the maternal health workforce, improve maternal mental health treatment, bolster community-based programs, train providers, enhance research, and ensure that maternal care is better coordinated.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is more than just the right thing to do &#8212; it&nbsp;is also a strategic imperative that makes all of us healthier and all of us stronger.&nbsp;&nbsp;When women &#8212; regardless of race &#8212; do&nbsp;not receive the health care they need and deserve, it threatens the strength and stability of our families, our communities, and&nbsp;our entire Nation.<br><br>It is on all of us to ensure that no person&#8217;s race ever determines their health outcomes and that every person preparing to give birth is treated with dignity, safety, and respect in our health care system.&nbsp;&nbsp;During Black Maternal Health Week, we refocus on that effort and celebrate America&#8217;s extraordinary maternal health care workforce &#8212; including doulas and midwives, who offer crucial support for our Nation&#8217;s mothers throughout pregnancy, childbirth, and postpartum and whose work is essential to the health and well-being of all of our mothers and&nbsp;children.<br><br>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in&nbsp;me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do&nbsp;hereby proclaim April 11 through April 17, 2022, as Black Maternal Health Week.&nbsp;&nbsp;I call upon all Americans to raise awareness of the state of Black maternal health in the United&nbsp;States by&nbsp;understanding the consequences of systemic discrimination, recognizing the scope of this problem and the need for urgent solutions, amplifying the voices and experiences of Black women, families, and communities, and committing to building a world in which Black women do not have to fear for their safety, their well-being, their dignity, or their lives before, during, and after pregnancy.<br><br>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this<br>eighth day of April, in the year of our Lord two&nbsp;thousand&nbsp;twenty-two, and of the Independence of the United&nbsp;States of&nbsp;America the two&nbsp;hundred and forty-sixth.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-right">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.</p>

<p>On April 14, 1890, 18 nations of this hemisphere came together to form the International Union of American Republics &#8212; the oldest regional international organization in the world and the precursor to the modern-day Organization of American States.&nbsp; Today, the Organization of American States consists of&nbsp;35 independent States from North America, Central America, South&nbsp;America, and the Caribbean and is dedicated to the principles of&nbsp;advancing peace, prosperity, and democracy throughout the Western Hemisphere.&nbsp; On Pan American Day and during Pan American Week, we recognize the strength of this regional community and celebrate our unity and shared values. &nbsp;</p>



<p>This year, as the United States prepares to host the Ninth&nbsp;Summit of the Americas &#8212; my Administration reaffirms our commitment to collectively addressing the challenges and opportunities we share with our regional neighbors.&nbsp; The theme of this year&#8217;s summit, &#8220;Building a Sustainable, Resilient, and Equitable Future&#8221; focuses on working together with our partners to produce better outcomes and strengthen our ability to respond to critical issues that affect all our nations. &nbsp;We need to emerge from the pandemic and bolster global health security, build strong and inclusive democracies, advance a joint approach to regional migration management, ensure humanitarian protection, and root out the corruption that reduces our ability to make progress.&nbsp; We will seize opportunities to address the climate crisis and accelerate the green energy transition. &nbsp;We&nbsp;will foster a transformation that will expand access to digital technologies, support independent media and civil society organizations, and ensure that economic growth is equitable and&nbsp;inclusive.</p>



<p>My Administration&#8217;s Build Back Better World initiative will&nbsp;play an important role in the Pan American region&#8217;s recovery from the economic impact of the pandemic, promoting the&nbsp;highest labor, environmental, social, and technical standards. In addition, our Call to Action, a public-private partnership supporting long-term development in Central America, will continue to generate private sector interest and build upon its&nbsp;$1.2 billion investment in the region.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is in our economic and national security interest and the entire Pan American region for our nations to advance a&nbsp;secure, economically prosperous, healthy, and democratic hemisphere for all our people.&nbsp; We can reach that future if we&nbsp;unite around principled and democratic leadership, anchored in&nbsp;the rule of law.&nbsp; The people throughout the region want governments that are accountable to voters and deliver real benefits including jobs, education, security, equal opportunity, and fundamental human and political rights.&nbsp; Support for democracy and respect for human rights is at the heart of all of&nbsp;the United States&#8217; engagement with our neighbors throughout the Americas.&nbsp; Twenty years after approval of the Inter-American Democratic Charter &#8212; affirming a collective commitment to strengthen democracy in the region &#8212; there is more work to do&nbsp;to fortify democratic institutions and prevent democratic backsliding in this hemisphere.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We will continue to build on the commitments made at the 2021 Summit for Democracy, in which 26 governments in the Western Hemisphere participated, to forge a more inclusive and&nbsp;democratic future.&nbsp; We will work with hemispheric leaders &#8212; incorporating the recommendations of diverse voices from youth, marginalized communities, the private sector, independent media, and civil society &#8212; to fulfill our commitments and drive our momentum forward.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is the time to take bold collective action to address our shared challenges.&nbsp; Climate change, the pandemic, repression, corruption, and democratic backsliding have created migration and refugee flows unequaled in the modern history of the region.&nbsp; This is bigger than any one country and any one border.&nbsp; Coordinated regional efforts are essential to respond to urgent humanitarian needs, provide legal alternatives to irregular migration, address root causes, counter corruption, and crack down on human smuggling networks that exploit the most vulnerable.&nbsp; As we approach the Summit of the Americas, our goal is to chart a new regional approach to improve how we jointly manage migration across the region for the coming decade.&nbsp;</p>



<p>My Administration will continue to work tirelessly to address these and other challenges, and to achieve our shared goals in the Pan American region.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During this Pan American Day and Pan American Week, we celebrate our close ties and shared values with the region, and&nbsp;we come together in the spirit of unity and optimism for a&nbsp;resilient, sustainable, and equitable future for all people of&nbsp;the Americas. &nbsp;</p>



<p>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 14, 2022, as Pan American Day and April 10 through April 16, 2022, as Pan American Week.  I urge the Governors of the 50 States, the Governor of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the officials of the other areas under the flag of the United States of America to honor these observances with appropriate ceremonies and activities.</p>



<p>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighth day of April, in the year of our Lord two&nbsp;thousand&nbsp;twenty-two, and of the Independence of the United&nbsp;States of&nbsp;America the two&nbsp;hundred and forty-sixth.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.commonwealthfund.org/blog/2022/impact-us-covid-19-vaccination-efforts-march-update">new study</a> out today from the Commonwealth Fund shows that President Biden’s relentless efforts to get Americans vaccinated saved millions of American lives. Our vaccination campaign saved 2.2 million American lives, prevented 17 million hospitalizations, prevented 66 million COVID-19 cases, and avoided $900 billion in health care costs.</p>



<p>This is the result of the Biden Administration’s efforts to use every tool to make vaccinations easy and convenient for every American, Congress providing us the vital resources we needed, and the American people stepping up and doing their part.</p>



<p>We mounted a historic vaccination effort and invested in tests and treatments – empowering Americans with more tools than ever before to protect themselves. Together, we’ve spared millions of families the immeasurable loss that too many others have suffered, and turned unthinkable pain into extraordinary purpose and progress.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, Republicans in Congress are now holding up critical funding we need to make even more progress – to save even more lives. Make no mistake: Inaction will leave our nation less prepared for any future surges and variants. It will mean fewer vaccines, treatments, and tests for the American people. This is deeply disappointing – and it should be unacceptable to every American. We’ve worked too hard and come too far to leave ourselves and our economy vulnerable to an unpredictable virus. The virus is not waiting on Congress to negotiate. Congress must act with urgency.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">James S. Brady Press Briefing Room</p>



<p>2:35 P.M. EDT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:  Hi, everyone.  Okay.  A couple of items for you at the top.</p>



<p>Obviously, this is a tremendously historic day in the White House and in the country, and this is a fulfillment of a promise the President made to the country.&nbsp; His time on the Judiciary Committee was defining for him and gave him historically exceptional preparation for what we would consider a smooth process characterized by heavy engagement with both parties in the Senate during both the advice and consent phases.</p>



<p>He promised to choose a successor in the mold of Justice Breyer, as Republicans and Democrats called for, and after thorough consideration, as you know, chose Judge Jackson.</p>



<p>The President&#8217;s outreach &#8212; Justice Jackson, I guess we can now call her.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The President&#8217;s outreach continued at this stage, calling senators in both parties early about his choice.&nbsp; Out of the gate, he proved he had chosen someone in the tradition by immediately getting endorsed by the Fraterni- &#8212; Fraternal Order of Police and Judge Thomas Griffith, followed by a procession of leading conservative legal minds and additional law enforcement organizations.</p>



<p>As we&#8217;ve talked about in here a bit, she began her prep work immediately, starting the day after she was announced, and promised to meet with anyone who wanted to and honored it, meeting with 97 senators over the course of her consultations.</p>



<p>She further displayed her work ethic, extraordinary credentials, and character when she testified for over 20 hours and answered the most QFRs of any SCOTUS nominee ever.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We also functioned seamlessly with the Judiciary Committee and leadership, and we were conscientious about being a good resource to Republicans.&nbsp; Senator Jones and the additional staff brought on during the process made invaluable contributions essential to success.</p>



<p>I also wanted to highlight that on UI data that was released today, as you can see in here, the comparison between January of 2021 and March, now that we are in, of 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over the last four weeks, fewer Americans filed initial claims for unemployment insurance than any time in recorded history.&nbsp; Since President Oba- &#8212; Biden took office, our economy has added 7.9 million jobs; that&#8217;s more jobs created on average per month than any other President in history.&nbsp; And last month, the unemployment rate fell to 3.6 percent, down from 6.7 percent when the President took office about 15 months ago.</p>



<p>This historic job growth is a direct result of the American Rescue Plan, which funded our vaccination strategy, reopened schools, and helped grow the economy from the bottom up and the middle out.</p>



<p>Last item for you before we get to your questions: Across the country, as we&#8217;ve talked about a bit in here, Republican elected officials are engaging in a disturbing, cynical trend of attacking vulnerable transgender kids for purely partisan, political reasons.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today in Alabama, instead of focusing on critical kitchen-table issues like the economy, COVID, or addressing the country&#8217;s mental health crisis, Republican lawmakers are currently debating legislation that, among many things, would target trans youth with tactics that threatens to put pediatricians in prison if they provide medically necessary, lifesaving healthcare for the kids they serve.</p>



<p>Just like the extreme government overreach we&#8217;ve seen in Texas, where politicians have sent state officials into the homes of loving parents to investigate them for abuse &#8212; just to harass and intimidate the LGBTQI+ community &#8212; today&#8217;s vote in Alabama will only serve to harm kids.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But Alabama&#8217;s lawmakers and other legislators who are contemplating these discriminar- &#8212; discriminatory bills have been put on notice by the Department of Justice and the Department of Health and Human Services that laws and policies preventing care that healthcare professionals recommend for transgender minors may violate the Constitution and federal law.</p>



<p>To be clear, every major medical association agrees that gender-affirming healthcare for transgender kids is a best practice and potentially lifesaving.</p>



<p>All of this begs an important question: What are these policies actually trying to solve for?&nbsp; LGBTQI+ people can&#8217;t be erased or forced back into any closets, and kids across our nation should be allowed to be who they are without the threat that their parents or their doctor could be imprisoned simply for helping them and loving them.</p>



<p>President Biden has committed in both words and actions to fight for all Americans and will not hesitate to hold these states accountable.</p>



<p>I would also note, since I&#8217;ve had a rotation of fabulous colleagues in here today: Today we have Vedant Patel here.&nbsp; You may all know him.&nbsp; Any of you who work on immigration and climate issues know him very well.&nbsp; I often joke with him that we give him the easy assignments.&nbsp; We did not.&nbsp; It&#8217;s just because he&#8217;s super talented.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vedant &#8212; I’ll say about him: He&#8217;s a beautiful writer.&nbsp; He&#8217;s a fast writer.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know if that means he could be a wire reporter.&nbsp; I think he has a very promising career in government ahead of him.&nbsp; But I just wanted to highlight Vedant and his amazing contributions and everything he does to help me, help all of us, help the President every day.</p>



<p>With that &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perfect.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve got &#8212; I’ve got three things.&nbsp; Thanks so much.&nbsp; Ukraine&#8217;s foreign minister at NATO made very clear that his country needs more weapons and needs them fast.&nbsp; I&#8217;m wondering if it&#8217;s time for the U.S. and other allies to not just provide defensive weaponry but actually provide offensive weapons.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, let me give you a sense of where we are.&nbsp; As of now, we have provided &#8212; committed to providing $1.7 billion of weapons, of security assistance to Ukraine since the beginning of this conflict; more than $2 billion since the President took office.&nbsp; There are transfers of systems nearly every single day.</p>



<p>I would note we just announced, two days ago, $100 million in Javelins, which are a critical weapon that the Ukrainians have been using effectively to fight the Russians, push back the Russians, and defend their country.</p>



<p>I would also note that as it relates to the type of systems and materiel we are providing: For every Russian tank in Ukraine, the United States will have or has provided 10 anti-tank systems.&nbsp; If you factor in contributions from allies, we&#8217;re almost at 90 to 1.&nbsp; That means one tank &#8212; Russian tank, 10 anti-tank systems to fight them back.&nbsp; For every Russian armored vehicle in Ukraine, the United States will have provided about three anti-armor systems.&nbsp; If you factor in contributions from allies, it&#8217;s about 25 to 1.</p>



<p>The way this works &#8212; and it’s the last thing I&#8217;ll say and get to your next question &#8212; the way that it works is that the Ukrainian leaders request a range of assistance.&nbsp; They often provide us lists.&nbsp; We go through that list; we determine what we can provide.&nbsp; We provide a vast, vast majority of what they&#8217;re requesting.&nbsp; If we don&#8217;t have access to it &#8212; sometimes it&#8217;s Russian-made military equipment &#8212; we work with our allies and partners to see what they can provide.</p>



<p>And our focus as our &#8212; as Department of Defense officials have conveyed on the Hill when they&#8217;ve testified this week, has been providing &#8212; providing what they are trained on and what we know is effective in fighting this war.&nbsp; And we&#8217;ve already seen, to date, that the use of this security assistance has been central and essential in effectively fighting the war as they have done.</p>



<p>Go ahead, Mara.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are you saying that that’s sufficient, that you feel that you&#8217;ve given them enough?&nbsp; I mean, what do you mean by those metrics?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I provided them because I think it&#8217;s interesting or compelling &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; &#8212; to understand &#8212; right? &#8212; the range and the significance and the totality of the type of assistance we&#8217;ve provided.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have not stopped nor are we stopping providing additional security assistance.&nbsp; We have announcements nearly every couple of days.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I just think that, to me, was interesting and compelling to better understand the significance and the broad scope of the assistance we’ve provided.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But you’re saying there&#8217;ll be no letup in your efforts to provide them with more?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; No, I don&#8217;t think I conveyed that in any &#8212; in any way.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All right.&nbsp; That’s fine.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yep, go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just to kind of follow up on that: The Secretary of State yesterday, in a Russian-language Telegram channel, said, quote, “[W]e&#8217;re looking at other systems &#8212; some of them larger, more sophisticated &#8212; that may be useful going forward…”&nbsp; Is he talking about the systems that allies might have that we&#8217;re trying to backfill?&nbsp; What was, for clarity’s perspective, was he trying to say there?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, partly, yes, because there are systems, of course, we have access to.&nbsp; We have the best military in the world.&nbsp; We have a range of systems we have access to that we have been providing and we will continue to provide.</p>



<p>There are certain systems, as you&#8217;ve noted &#8212; the S-300 is one of them, of course &#8212; where they have requested.&nbsp; We have to continue to work with allies and partners on what systems and equipment they have access to and they would have the capacity to provide.&nbsp; Sometimes that means backfilling systems.&nbsp; And there is also systems and &#8212; weapons systems that they may request that we may not talk about because, for operational reasons and their own process, it wouldn&#8217;t be to their benefit to do that.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So he’s potentially talking about U.S. systems that we just aren&#8217;t necessarily aware of at this point?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; He&#8217;s &#8212; he&#8217;s talking about &#8212; we&#8217;re not going to detail always every type of system or every type of weapon we&#8217;re going to work with allies to provide or provide.&nbsp; We have provi- &#8212; we have detailed it quite extensively from here, but we&#8217;re not going to detail everything &#8212; we haven&#8217;t &#8212; over the course of time for operational purposes.&nbsp; But what he was conveying is that we&#8217;ll continue to work with our partners and allies in meeting the needs and the requests that the Ukrainians have put forward.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; And then, Germany&#8217;s foreign intelligence service briefed a parliamentary committee over there that it had intercepted radio communications of Russian soldiers talking about killing civilians.&nbsp; Is the U.S. either aware of that intelligence, or does it have any intercepts of its own that show something similar?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I have seen the reports, but I don&#8217;t have anything more on those reports or the intelligence.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; I guess the President obviously tested negative today.&nbsp; And according to CDC guidelines &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yesterday.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#8217;m sorry, yesterday.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yes.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speaker Pelosi was not considered a close contact, but it seems like a very close call.&nbsp; I know you said that he had a second booster and that he&#8217;s following CDC guidelines.&nbsp; But given the importance of his role and his age, is the White House considering any stricter measures to keep him safe: more mask wearing, fewer big venue events, more outdoor events?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, when you say it&#8217;s a “close call,” I&#8217;m not sure what you mean by that.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Close call in the sense that they were in two events at the White House together; within two days, she tested positive.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure, sure.&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Well, for clarity purposes, what &#8212; the way a “close contact” is defined &#8212; it&#8217;s not arbitrary.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not something made up by the White House.&nbsp; It&#8217;s CDC guidelines.&nbsp; And how they define it is being within six feet for a cumulative total of 15 minutes over a 24-hour period.&nbsp; That &#8212; they were not.&nbsp; All of their interactions were publicly available; I think you saw them.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s how that assessment is made.</p>



<p>In terms of additional testing or anything along those lines, those assessments would be made by the President&#8217;s doctor.&nbsp; He was tested last evening and tested negative.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have incredibly stringent protocols here at the White House that we keep in place to keep the President safe, to keep everybody safe.&nbsp; Those go over and above CDC guidelines, and that includes ensuring that anyone who is going to be around the President is tested.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Every member of the staff is on a regular testing protocol.&nbsp; If you&#8217;re going to see him in person, whether you&#8217;re traveling with him or you&#8217;re meeting in the Oval Office, you will be tested.&nbsp; If you &#8212; we try to do socially distanced meetings when necessary.&nbsp; For those employees who test positive, they are required to isolate, of course, in alignment with CDC guidance, and must test negative before returning to work.&nbsp; That is also a step that goes over and above.</p>



<p>But we are going to continue to follow the protocols.&nbsp; And I would remind you and reiterate that we also put out a plan just a month ago that made clear that while COVID-19 will continue to be with us and we will see cases rise and fall, as we are seeing them rise now &#8212; to be expected, given the transmissibility of BA.2 &#8212; we can now &#8212; we now have steps to go back to many of our normal routines in alignment with what the CDC continues to recommend.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And given the fact that there has been this uptick among, you know, people who have been following CDC guidelines, are there plans to revisit those guidelines or edit them in some way, given the uptick?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; That would be up to the CDC.&nbsp; But again, I think when they put out these guidelines, they made clear that it was about looking at data on hospitalizations and even deaths.&nbsp; And what we have a plan to address, and I would note &#8212; I have it with me, because we really like COVID props this week &#8212; right here.&nbsp; We have copies for anyone who would like a copy.</p>



<p>And this is a 100-page preparedness plan that we put out that &#8212; meant to protect against and treat COVID, prepare for new variants, prevent shutdowns, vaccinate the world.</p>



<p>We expected there to be ups and downs and increases.&nbsp; And with a transmissible &#8212; a variant that’s as transmissible as BA.2, that’s what we&#8217;re seeing at this point in time in the White House, in &#8212; among the press corps, among the general public.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And the most important message we&#8217;re sending to the public is that we have steps in place that we can take to continue to address it.&nbsp; And even as we&#8217;re continuing to fight COVID, we can, for the most part, return to our normal routines.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And quickly, on another topic.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Congress voted to remove most-favored-nation trade status for Russia and Belarus and ban oil imports.&nbsp; Does President Biden plan to sign &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; A hundred to zero.&nbsp; Right?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exactly.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Yes, this is something the President supports, had called for, and certainly plans to sign it.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Back on COVID, you just said that anyone who is around the President is tested.&nbsp; Does that apply just to Executive Office employees, or is that true also of any members of Congress or invited guests who are here at the White House meeting with the President?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; If they are individuals who have a meeting with the President.&nbsp; That&#8217;s what I was referring to: our own protocols.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, if you&#8217;re at an event, obviously there are assessments made on a case by case.&nbsp; But if somebody is going to be in close proximity, standing next to him, sitting next to him on a stage, that would be obviously different than a broad group of attendees.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And given, sort of, the uptick in cases that we&#8217;ve seen here at the White House, on the Hill &#8212; there seems to be, you know, cases going around within the political world here in Washington &#8212; and the fact that sometimes you do go beyond the CDC-recommended guidelines, is there any plan just to test the President daily for the next few days or week or so?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; That would be a decision made by his doctor, but that is not deemed to be necessary at this point.</p>



<p>Q    And on another topic: A Service agent from the First Lady&#8217;s detail was placed on administrative leave after they associated with and were provided gifts from two men who were pretending to be Homeland Security Investigations agents.  Is the First Lady aware of this?  Is the President aware of this? How concerned are they?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have any comment from here.&nbsp; I&#8217;d point you to the Secret Service and others investigating.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, just &#8212; do you have any further guidance on what these two men were after or who they may have been working with?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; It’s being investigated, and I would point you to the proper agencies for any further comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; Back on COVID, it&#8217;s pretty clear that vaccines and boosters are not going to prevent you from getting COVID, but we know from science that masking does.&nbsp; Given you yourself saying, you know, how transmissible BA.2 is, are there any conversations happening here on campus, at the White House, to reinstate a mask mandate?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We would continue to follow CDC guidance.&nbsp; That&#8217;s not what they&#8217;re recommending, given we are in a yellow zone at this point in time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are individuals who are masked because they are close contact, and that is part of our protocols &#8212; they have had a close contact.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s part of our protocols.&nbsp; And individuals who may decide to mask because they have health issues in their family, personally.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s something we also certainly support.&nbsp; But we would always abide by CDC guidance and go beyond it if necessary.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And given what you&#8217;ve said about the plan in place and about living with COVID, is the end goal not to stop the spread anymore?&nbsp; Is it just to stop severe cases?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, again &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or are you still trying to stop the spread?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Of course, we&#8217;re trying to stop the spread, and we have the means to address that.&nbsp; We&#8217;re also, though &#8212; I would point you to the 100-page plan we put out just a month ago, where it made clear that we will continue to see COVID &#8212; COVID will continue to be with us; we will see cases rise and fall.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We now know how to protect ourselves from hospitalization and death, which is hugely important.&nbsp; We know how &#8212; how much getting vaccinated, getting boosted can protect you.&nbsp; And we know, here in the White House, of course, 99 percent of people are vaccinated; many, many people are boosted.&nbsp; And so, we have policies that also go even beyond.</p>



<p>What is most important right now, as we&#8217;re looking broadly to the country, is the fact that we are very concerned about the failure of Congress to continue to fund our COVID response &#8212; the fact that we have needed to, therefore, end our program for the uninsured.&nbsp; We are not going to be able to make purchases of a broad scope of boosters; of Evusheld, which is a treatment for immunocompromised &#8212; or preventative treatment for immunocompromised.&nbsp; That when we get to the end of June, our testing capacity will be at risk of collapsing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And as we&#8217;re looking broadly beyond the White House of how we&#8217;re planning, that is our greatest, biggest concern at this point in time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; And just one more on the news of the day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You just talked about how historic today was for Judge Jackson to be confirmed, but no reporters were allowed in the room, no TV cameras were allowed in the room to help record that history.&nbsp; Can you help us understand that decision?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, today was meant to be a private moment between the President and Judge Jackson.&nbsp; And we made a decision late in the process that we would have some photographers &#8212; some of your colleagues in the news media &#8212; in the room to capture it for history.&nbsp; Those photos have been used by networks &#8212; including, likely, your network &#8212; over the course of the last hour.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But this was meant to be a private moment.&nbsp; Tomorrow, as we&#8217;ve announced, we have an event &#8212; a moment in history &#8212; where, certainly, the President will be speaking.&nbsp; We will have a range of guests.&nbsp; It will be an outside event.&nbsp; And we&#8217;ll be marking it in that way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; How can you guys say that President Biden was not a close contact with Speaker Pelosi when there is video of the Speaker kissing him?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, Peter, the way that it is defined is by the Center for Disease Control &#8212; the CDC.&nbsp; And their definition of it is 15 minutes of contact within a set period of time within six feet.&nbsp; It did not meet that bar.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It does not mean that no one will get COVID around the world who does not have a close contact.&nbsp; It just means we are defining, for all of you, whether the President and their interaction met the definition of the CDC of a close contact.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Half the Cabinet was there on Tuesday.&nbsp; At least two additional Cabinet members &#8212; Raimondo and Garland &#8212; already have COVID.&nbsp; Is there a threat that this is going to be a national security problem if the Cabinet comes to the White House and starts getting infected with COVID?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I don&#8217;t think, Peter, we can assess where they &#8212; where they got COVID or where they &#8212; where they acquired COVID &#8212; or whatever the right way to say that is.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know that it was Tuesday.&nbsp; There are other events obviously that have happened over the course of the last week as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They are all boosted.&nbsp; They are all &#8212; many of them are able to work from home, as many staff and even reporters are, who are &#8212; who are vaccinated and boosted.&nbsp; And they all have a talented and experienced team who is stepping into their shoes where needed in the office.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the last President wanted to host a big event for a Supreme Court nominee here at the White House, some folks got COVID and then-former Vice President Biden called it a “super spreader event.”&nbsp; So is there any risk that this event tomorrow for a Biden Supreme Court, now, Justice is going to be a super spreader event?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, one, at that point in time, vaccines weren&#8217;t available.&nbsp; People were not vaccinated.&nbsp; It certainly puts us in a different space.&nbsp; This event is also going to be outside tomorrow.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, on a different topic, when Title 42 expires next month, what is the plan for the 18,000 migrants a day that are going to cross?&nbsp; Do you want them to get jobs here?&nbsp; Is there something else that you want these 18,000 a day to be doing?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know where you&#8217;re basing your specific numbers on, Peter.&nbsp; But what I would tell you &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eighteen thousand &#8212; I&#8217;ve got it right here: “Earlier this week, the Department gave reporters an estimate that up to 18,000 migrants could be apprehended at the border each day if Title 42 were to be lifted.”&nbsp; That’s from ABC News.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, “up to.”&nbsp; And we’ll see what happens.&nbsp; And, obviously, we&#8217;re taking steps to convey that this is not the time to come.&nbsp; Individuals who come to the border &#8212; this is what would happen: CBP and ICE would work together to ensure that anyone who enters the country without authorization is put into immigration proceedings as quickly as possible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>CBP has been working with ICE to ensure individuals awaiting processing in the interior of the country monitor und- &#8212; would be monitored under the Alternatives to Detention program.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We know that, to date, nearly 80 percent of non-citizens waiting in the interior under prosecut- &#8212; prosecutorial discretion have either received a notice to appear or are still within their window to report.&nbsp; That is what would happen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition, I would note the Department of Homeland Security also put together a preparedness plan to continue addressing irregular migration that involves surging personnel and resources to the border, improving border processing, implementing mitigation measures, and working with other countries in the hemisphere to manage migration.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Those are all steps that they&#8217;re working to do in order to implement when we get to that point in time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the last one on this: Now that the Texas governor is saying that he&#8217;s going to start busing border crossers to Washington, D.C., when they get here, are you guys going to help them find a place to stay and something for them to do?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I&#8217;m not aware of what authority the governor would be doing that under.&nbsp; I think it&#8217;s pretty clear this is a publicity stunt.&nbsp; His own office admits that a migrant would need to voluntarily be transported and that he can&#8217;t compel them to.&nbsp; Because again, enforcement of our country&#8217;s immigration laws lies with the federal government, not a state.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You don’t think people want to visit Washington, D.C.?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, listen, I don&#8217;t know, but I know that the governor of Texas or any state does not have the legal authority to compel anyone to get on a bus.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, is there pressure to avoid saying that President Biden has a &#8212; had a close contact given his position and the demands of his schedule?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; No.&nbsp; We announced yesterday the Vice President had a close contact.&nbsp; And if there is 15 minutes that he spends with somebody in person within six feet and they test positive for COVID, then that would be a close contact.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, given, you said, it’s not &#8212; it doesn’t necessarily take 15 minutes to get COVID &#8212; right?&nbsp; So it could take less than that.&nbsp; Obviously, he was around Nancy Pelosi and many others.&nbsp; Are you doing anything differently?&nbsp; Is there anything being done differently, given that circumstance for the President?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; He was tested last night and tested negative.&nbsp; And if his doctor deems he should be tested more frequently, he certainly could do that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But if just, for example &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; But, again, the CDC guidelines are in place. And the CDC specifics on what a close contact and how it&#8217;s defined are in place for a reason: to give everybody clear, data-driven guidance.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is clear, but it&#8217;s not always accurate, right? Because it doesn&#8217;t take 15 minutes to get COVID, and this is more transmissible &#8212; this latest variant &#8212; than other variants in the past.&nbsp; It doesn&#8217;t necessarily require that much time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, yesterday we were in the State Dining Room.&nbsp; The President was face to face with many individuals, right up in their mugs, for extended periods of time because he was enjoying this moment &#8212; a chance to visit with folks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, for clarity, not everybody in that room was tested in advance of arriving.&nbsp; Correct?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Correct.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, some of those people who may have been further back but ultimately had, I don’t know, five minutes &#8212; we watched for an hour, literally &#8212; in the room may not have been with him for 15 minutes, but could have been in his face having not been tested for an extended period of time.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, again, if individuals are within six feet of him for 15 minutes or more, that&#8217;s considered a close contact.&nbsp; No one in there was, that I&#8217;m aware of.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ketanji Brown Jackson tested negative before her visit today, I trust.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have any more details on Ketanji Brown Jackson’s testing protocols.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me ask you about the Secret Service very quickly, if I can.&nbsp; Does the President maintain confidence in the Director of the Secret Service, James Murray?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen?&nbsp; Jen?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me just get some clarity.&nbsp; Is it your sense that Judge Jackson will ascend to the bench sooner than the end of the term?&nbsp; Because our understanding was that Justice Breyer was going to retire at the end of the term.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have any updates on that, but &#8212; or any changes to that, no.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; I want to give you a chance to respond.&nbsp; Jonathan Swan did an interview with Mitch McConnell this morning, in which he &#8212; Swan asked McConnell whether, if the Republicans should take the Senate in the midterm elections and another vacancy should occur while this President is still in office, whether a Republican-controlled Senate would hold a hearing on another Biden nominee.&nbsp; He refused to answer that question.&nbsp; Do you have a response to that?&nbsp; And what do you think it says about the health of our constitutional system?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I think given it&#8217;s a day where, with bipartisan support, we have a new &#8212; we are about to have a new member of the Supreme Court &#8212; a historic and eminently qualified member of the Supreme Court &#8212; and she did get three Republicans supporting her &#8212; that is a good sign and something we should take a moment to celebrate.</p>



<p>Certainly, we don&#8217;t anticipate or predict &#8212; I have no prediction of an additional opening, but we would certainly expect and call for all members of the Senate to operate as professionally as the President and our team did in this case, which is ensuring that there was advice and consent, that she met &#8212; that the &#8212; our nominee met with 97 senators.&nbsp; That&#8217;s obviously a great number from the other party.&nbsp; That is how we would conduct ourselves, and we would expect the same in response.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The CDC aside, and distance, et cetera &#8212; has the President expressed any surprise or amazement that there&#8217;s a number of cases around him?&nbsp; And has he asked for people to stay away?&nbsp; What&#8217;s his &#8212; just his kind of human-level response to what&#8217;s going on?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; No.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not at all?&nbsp; (Laughter.)</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; No, he&#8217;s &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He&#8217;s completely &#8212; he&#8217;s completely nonplussed by the fact that a growing number of people around him are getting COVID?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We have anticipated that there would be rising numbers of COVID cases.&nbsp; It is not the numbers, in here, where it was around Omicron.&nbsp; And I don&#8217;t know if it was among the press corps.&nbsp; It certainly wasn&#8217;t among the general public.</p>



<p>He knows there are a number of steps and precautions that we put in place and we take to protect him and protect the Vice President and other senior members of the team.&nbsp; That includes testing for anybody who goes to see him.&nbsp; That includes social distancing in meetings whenever possible &#8212; a step we take &#8212; an additional precautionary step we take in order to protect him and protect other senior members of the White House.</p>



<p>Q    And just a second question, if I can.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there any ongoing or future &#8212; near-future conversations with China on the Russia situation?&nbsp; Or has the U.S. just concluded China is not going to budge on its position, which is to not really get involved and try to push them off?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; There will be ongoing conversations with China, I would expect, including our expectation that they abide by sanctions and that they not provide material support to Russia.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t have anything to predict in terms of which channel it will happen through next, but certainly I would expect there will be ongoing and continued conversations.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, a follow-up on &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, can I ask whether it&#8217;s the view of the President&#8217;s position that if he gets COVID, he&#8217;ll have a mild case because he has the second booster, given his age and given his health profile?&nbsp; Do you expect it not to be a serious case if he were to get it?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I think that is what we see statistically and through &#8212; as we look at health analysis and data.&nbsp; But, obviously, you know, we would &#8212; he would be treated by his doctor.&nbsp; And I&#8217;m not going to make a prediction of that at this point in time.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And is it fair for us to conclude that the event tomorrow &#8212; was a factor in it being outside and being tomorrow, given outside it’s raining today &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; It&#8217;s supposed to be a beautiful day.&nbsp; That is a big factor.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it fair to say COVID risk was part of the calculus in deciding how to mark this confirmation?&nbsp; Did you &#8212; is that part of the reason it&#8217;s outside?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would tell you that the biggest factors are actually that &#8212; and we would’ve had events outside earlier in the week too, had the weather allowed.</p>



<p>It is that time of year, and certainly we do know that it is better to have events outside when you can have them outside.&nbsp; It is meant to be &#8212; it is supposed to be a beautiful day.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not a weatherperson, but that is what everything is telling us.&nbsp; And also, we want to be able to invite a large number of people, and this would enable us to do that.&nbsp; So, those are the biggest factors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But there&#8217;s no question, Josh, that that also is true statistically, or (inaudible).</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the CDC is actually a little less clear on the link between the two clauses that you&#8217;re linking. &nbsp;And they talked about, &#8220;Was this person less than six feet away from someone?&#8221; &nbsp;Yes, in President Biden&#8217;s case.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And then they asked &#8212; they say to consider the time spent with someone starting two days before. &nbsp;So that includes both the ACA event and yesterday&#8217;s event.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And then, separately, they say, “Have they been in the presence of someone with confirmed or suspected COVID for a total of 15 minutes or more over a 24-hour period?”</p>



<p>As far as we know, Speaker Pelosi might&#8217;ve left right after the event.&nbsp; That was about 14 minutes yesterday.&nbsp; And they spent about 45 minutes the day before.&nbsp; So, is the White House position &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; But she wasn&#8217;t &#8212;</p>



<p>Q    &#8212; but she was, like, seven feet away.  She was, you know, as far as you.  So, is it the White House position that President Biden &#8212; 14 minutes, seven feet away from Speaker Pelosi &#8212; is not a close contact, but 15 minutes, six feet away would have been a close contact?</p>



<p>And I ask by way of saying: Was there a discussion of whether to treat him as a close contact to anybody?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, he is tested regularly.&nbsp; As you know, he was tested yesterday.&nbsp; He will be tested again soon.&nbsp; He&#8217;s tested typically a couple of times a week.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If he is a &#8212; if he were a close contact, the only difference &#8212; or I don&#8217;t even know that it would be a difference; it would be a five &#8212; a five-day te- &#8212; a test five days after your contact.&nbsp; So &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Inaudible) he&#8217;d have to wear a mask for 10 days in public.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; And if he is a close contact, that is what exactly he will do.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; And, Jen, sorry &#8212; on the broader COVID question:&nbsp;It looks like that bill has stalled now.&nbsp; What are the short-term consequences of not having new funding in place?&nbsp; Is there a risk that you can&#8217;t proceed with previously announced funding, namely of Pfizer&#8217;s pill, Paxlovid?&nbsp; And when do you think the shipments of the monoclonal antibodies will run out?&nbsp; They were supposed to run out in May, but you’ve been shipping fewer of them.&nbsp; How long will the cupboard last on the monoclonals without any money?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I may have to check on that specific component for you, Josh, and I&#8217;m happy to do that.&nbsp; I mean, what we do know is that, by the end of June, the testing capacity will be at risk.&nbsp; Our testing capacity will be at the risk of &#8212; risk of collapsing, at least from the federal government and what we can provide.</p>



<p>We know that we can&#8217;t buy any additional treatments beyond those that have already been paid for and contracted, of course, including preventative treatments for immunocompromised.&nbsp; Those treatments, as you know, often take six months to manufacture, so we&#8217;d also be losing out on supply that we intended to purchase for September through January. &nbsp;And, of course, the uninsured fund is already closed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But I can certainly check on the next purchase of monoclonals and if we &#8212; if we have any ability to purchase that as planned.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What&#8217;s the difference if a bill passes three weeks from now versus having &#8212; if it had passed this week?&nbsp; Do those three weeks matter?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, we would be able to have the funding, hopefully, to reopen some of our uninsured programming.&nbsp; We&#8217;d be able to get ahead and plan ahead for purchases of testing &#8212; to ensure we had testing capacity; to make sure we could place some orders for treatment &#8212; preventative treatments for the immunocompromised.&nbsp; It just delays the process.</p>



<p>And as we know, they&#8217;re going on a two-week recess right now.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey, Jen.&nbsp; Thanks. &nbsp;I appreciate it.&nbsp; I have a non-COVID question, I swear. &nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But first I want to &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; You can ask me a COVID question too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Go ahead.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; I appreciate it.&nbsp; I just want to be specific about tomorrow.&nbsp; Are folks who are attending going to be required to take any additional steps &#8212; you know, other than it being outside and all that stuff &#8212; but testing by senators for example, or, you know, distance kept by the President?&nbsp; Is there going to be anything above and beyond just being outside?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Not that I&#8217;m aware of.&nbsp; But it being outside is certainly an important component here.&nbsp; And typically, individuals who are going to be in close proximity, like on the stage or something, they would be tested.&nbsp; But there are protocols that are evaluated on a case by case as we have events.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And a question on Puerto Rico &#8212; non-COVID &#8212; I swore, right?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Okay.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There&#8217;s a million-people-plus without power there.&nbsp; A lot of people criticizing that the federal government has not done enough to fix the grid there &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; after recent hurricanes.&nbsp; I wonder what &#8212; you know, is the President read in on this?&nbsp; Are there any actions that the President is planning to do there?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; Let me check.&nbsp; I know we&#8217;ve provided a broad range and a significant amount of financial assistance, but let me &#8212; let me check and see where that &#8212; what the status is at this point in time.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I also ask you about the Amir Locke &#8212; the case involving Amir Locke &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; and the officers that are not charged in that case?&nbsp; Is the President read in on that?&nbsp; And is there any &#8212; does he have any thoughts on, like, the no-knock warrants?&nbsp; I think you addressed this in February a little bit, but I wonder if there&#8217;s been any action or movement or further conversation about it.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, let me give you &#8212; I mean, so, first, like so many across the nation &#8212; and obviously this news is a reminder of how we&#8217;ve all mourned the tragic death of Amir Locke.&nbsp; And our thoughts and prayers continue to be with his family.</p>



<p>The President is committed &#8212; and, of course, he is aware of.&nbsp; And I would point you to the Department of Justice for any specifics about next legal actions.&nbsp; But the President is committed to ensuring fair, impartial, and effective policing, keeping our communities safe.&nbsp; Those goals go hand-in-hand, and we can achieve them, in part, by building trust between the police and communities they serve.</p>



<p>So, to go to your other questions: In September, the Attorney General issued a new policy imposing restrictions on the use of no-knock warrants, chokeholds, and carotid restraints by federal agents.</p>



<p>President Biden also continues to call on Congress to pass comprehensive police reform legislation.&nbsp; But since Republicans refuse to support the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, we are looking at additional steps we can take.&nbsp; We are continuing to look at them on executive action to advance police reform, obviously something we put a pause on while that was being negotiated.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t have an update on the timing of that, but that is something we are continuing to look at to build on, of course, the actions taken by the Department of Justice.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, Jen.&nbsp; You noted that Vice President Kamala Harris is considered a close contact.&nbsp; CDC guidance says to wear a mask.&nbsp; Today, she was presiding over the vote for Ketanji Brown Jackson and didn’t wear a mask.&nbsp; I guess, does the White House have a response to that?&nbsp; Was that a breach of protocol?&nbsp; Or, I guess, what made it different that she didn&#8217;t have to wear a mask?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I haven&#8217;t seen &#8212; I obviously watched most parts of the vote, but I know that she was alone, up &#8212; kind of on the dais for the vast majority of that.&nbsp; And, of course, she has been wearing a mask otherwise.&nbsp; But beyond that, I haven&#8217;t &#8212; I haven&#8217;t done any further analysis.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then one more question, sort of on immigration.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are reports that there has been an increased number of Ukrainian refugees heading to this &#8212; that are at the southern border &#8212; around 2,000 in Tijuana.&nbsp; I guess I was wondering, what are the administration&#8217;s plans to kind of address a rise of Ukrainian refugees that might come to the southern border?</p>



<p>You know, the State Department hasn&#8217;t really outlined the specifics on how they want to, you know, address allowing 100,000 Ukrainian refugees to the U.S.&nbsp; So, I guess, is there any other preparations that are being made in addition to whatever expected rise of migrants coming to the border once Title 42 ends?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; Well, I would say that we are still working through the policy process that, hopefully, we&#8217;ll have more to say on soon about what specific mechanisms Ukrainians can apply who wish to come to the United States, even though we know the vast majority have made clear they would like to stay in neighboring countries, which is why we&#8217;re providing the most humanitarian assistance of any country in the world to support those efforts that neighboring countries are &#8212; have undertaken to host refugees.</p>



<p>There are very good questions, I&#8217;m sure you have, about family reunification, prioritization, and whether there will be prioritization for individuals who fear persecution and things along those lines.&nbsp; Those are all important questions that are being discussed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You know, we are still implementing Title 42 at the border for anyone who comes to the border.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re working toward implementation of the lifting of Title 42 next month. &nbsp;And we would apply the policy to everybody.&nbsp; But obviously &#8212; coming from any country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But, obviously, there would be these programs &#8212; and we&#8217;d have more details before then, for sure &#8212; that Ukrainians who are eligible would be able to apply for.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.&nbsp; I have two questions.&nbsp; The first one is: &#8220;Budget Day&#8221; in Ottawa today.&nbsp; And up to $8 billion in new money will go to defense purpose, which will be bring Canada&#8217;s defense contribution to approximately 1.5 percent of the GDP; not yet to the 2 percent.&nbsp; Does the administration wish Canada would do more, considering the actual war in Ukraine?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, we applaud that increase, and we applaud Canada&#8217;s efforts and support for &#8212; in standing up against the invasion of Ukraine by President Putin and the Russians.&nbsp; And they are an important partner and continue to be.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And my second question, it goes back to the aid &#8212; the aid you detailed at the beginning of the briefing to the Russian military, all sorts of &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Ukrainian military.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Ukrainian &#8212; yeah, Ukraine military, of course.&nbsp; Sorry.&nbsp; I just want to verify again: You referred to, you know, that they &#8212; there are requests coming to you, and you go through the list, and sometimes you need old Soviet equipment.&nbsp; Are the MiG-29s in &#8212; still in the list?&nbsp; And is the administration considering transferring those Polish planes to Ukraine (inaudible)?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Our policy has not changed, but other countries, of course, could make that determination and decide to do it, and we certainly wouldn&#8217;t stand in the way.&nbsp; But our policy has not changed.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, when &#8212; so when President Biden continued the pause on student loan payments &#8212; repayments, he said that that pause will provide a “continued lifeline as we recover and rebuild from the pandemic.”&nbsp; You said today you want to stop the spread of COVID.&nbsp; So, my question is: If we&#8217;re still recovering from the pandemic, why then is Title 42 going to be re-lifted?&nbsp; Is there a revis- &#8212; a revisit that you can look at that?&nbsp; And have we just recovered from the border, then &#8212; does that mean?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Let me see if I can unpack &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; &#8212; a few things in there.&nbsp; First, on the announcement about the extension of student loan pau- &#8212; the student loan pause: What I said yesterday is also that what we look at is the impact of the pandemic on the economic recovery.&nbsp; And even though the economy has &#8212; is very strong &#8212; look at the UI data from today; look at the jobs data from last Friday &#8212; we certainly know that costs are continuing to impact people across the country, including students who have &#8212; who have &#8212; or former students who have student loan payments they need to make.</p>



<p>And the President is going to look for every way he can lower costs for the American people, whether that is the “family <s>fix</s> [glitch]” that he announced with former President Obama earlier this week or the announcement about the pause on student loan payments. </p>



<p>The decision about Title 42 is a decision made by the CDC &#8212; a public health decision.&nbsp; It’s not immigration authority or policy, it&#8217;s a public health decision, and we respect the authority given to them by Congress to make that determination.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; And one more.&nbsp; The President said that sanctions were not a deterrent on Russia going into Ukraine.&nbsp; Yesterday, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is saying that the U.S. would use all its sanction tools should China move towards Taiwan.&nbsp; So, is that message a deterrent or not?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, we have sanctioned China in the past, as you know, for human rights abuses.&nbsp; And we have sanctioned a range of countries, certainly, around the world.&nbsp; I would say sanctions have a range of purposes, including putting consequences in place.&nbsp; And where we are, as it relates to the war in Ukraine, is also making it much more difficult for President Putin to fund this war, and that is a huge priority to us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t have any predictions about future sanctions.&nbsp; I would leave that at the comments of the Treasury Secretary.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But given how &#8212; given how intertwined our economies are, could we really do sanctions on China like we are on &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; That is assessment that the Department of Treasury would have to make, but I don&#8217;t have a prediction beyond what the Secretary of Treasury said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; This week, you’ve been critical of Republicans trying to add amendment votes onto the COVID funding bill, specifically regarding Title 42.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yesterday, you said they decided to move the goalposts and that the White House is questioning whether Republicans are acting in good faith or if they&#8217;re just playing politics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But Democratic senators Mark Kelly, Kyrsten Sinema, Joe Manchin, Maggie Hassan, and Jon Tester are joining Republicans in this effort.&nbsp; Does the White House have the same criticism we&#8217;ve heard about Republicans?&nbsp; Does that apply to these Democratic senators as well?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Look, regardless of who&#8217;s standing against this, our larger point here is: If we do not have treatments, vaccines, or tests that the American people need, Americans will die from COVID and &#8212; whether they support or oppose the administration on immigration or childcare, environt- &#8212; environmental rules &#8212; anybody.</p>



<p>And so, our point: It’s not political.&nbsp; The vast majority of people who are opposing this moving forward are Republicans; that is a fact.&nbsp; But our point here is that there is an urgency to move forward.&nbsp; We can have a range of debates about a range of issues we have disagreements on; that&#8217;s fine &#8212; immigration, childcare, environmental rules. &nbsp;We welcome that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By the way, the President put forward an immigration bill his first day in office.&nbsp; If Republicans want to work on immigration, come on down to the White House; we&#8217;re happy to work with you on it.</p>



<p>But right now, this is a game of politics, and we need to get this funding, otherwise people in the country are going to die.&nbsp; That&#8217;s our larger point.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And a quick follow-up on Vice President Harris.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was a close contact.&nbsp; Tomorrow, during the event or if there&#8217;s any reception behind the scenes, will she be required to wear a mask indoors?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; She&#8217;ll follow CDC protocols in any of her events.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; The congressional approval from the confirmation vote today tells us that Senator Rand Paul cast his vote from the GOP cloakroom.&nbsp; He was in casual clothes, without a suit jacket or tie, so he was unable to come onto the floor. There are reports, I think, two other Republican senators may have done similar.&nbsp; Is that an appropriate way to vote on a historic occasion like this?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I will tell you, I&#8217;m not spending a lot of time, nor is the President, thinking about the dress code of Rand Paul today.&nbsp; We&#8217;re thinking about the historic confirmation of an eminently qualified Black woman to serve on the Supreme Court.&nbsp; Not really worried about his khakis.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And if I &#8212; if I may as well: We&#8217;ve enjoyed your shout-outs to members of your team.&nbsp; I wonder if this means you&#8217;re now working on notice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I&#8217;m &#8212; I&#8217;m sorry, what?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether you&#8217;re now &#8212; is that an American phrase? &#8212; whether you&#8217;re now working on notice, on your &#8212; on your way out.&nbsp; Is it underway?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp;&nbsp; I think I&#8217;m &#8212; I &#8212; it’s &#8212; I don&#8217;t know that it&#8217;s an American phrase.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; I &#8212; I have &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Excuse my Briticism.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; No, no, I &#8212; I love the Britishness and the accent, not to put you on notice of sorts.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Look, I think it is simply a reflection of my appreciation for the incredible people on my team that I get to work with every day.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve shouted them out in the past before.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve ma- &#8212; I&#8217;ve presented them with sashes to wear &#8212; all sorts of embarrassing things.&nbsp; And I think working in the White House, just like being a reporter &#8212; people think you have glamorous se- &#8212; glamorous setups back there.&nbsp; I&#8217;m here to confirm that is not the case.&nbsp; But our team works their tails off.&nbsp; There&#8217;s a lot going on.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s just simply an effort to recognize that.</p>



<p>(Cross-talk by reporters.)</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I have nothing to announce about &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Final question, Jen.&nbsp; Jen, final question.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; Yes.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And that is: What is this administration’s response to Israel for their role as mediator in this Russia-Ukraine crisis?&nbsp; And I have a follow-up question.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Well, we certainly support the efforts of a range of leaders to &#8212; that &#8212; who are hoping to play a diplomatic role here.&nbsp; And there are a number of leaders around the world who have also had engagements with Russians and engagements with the Ukrainians, and we just ask that they all engage closely with Ukrainians as well.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; To help Europe develop energy independence from Russia, would the Biden administration drop its opposition to the EU EastMed pipeline being developed by Israel, Cyprus, and Greece?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Look, I think there&#8217;s going to be decisions made by European leaders about how to reduce their &#8212; any level of dependence they have on Russian oil.&nbsp; You&#8217;ve seen a number of leaders this week announce their intention to ban oil imports from Russia.&nbsp; But I would remind you that pipelines are a means of moving oil; it&#8217;s not a means of production.&nbsp; But I’d point you to the European leader to speak to that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thanks so much, everyone.</p>
