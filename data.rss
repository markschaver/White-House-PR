<p>This week, as President Biden showcased America’s leadership on the world stage, Biden-Harris Cabinet members and administration officials led a nationwide economic travel blitz to highlight how the President’s economic agenda is delivering results for communities here in the states. &nbsp;<br><br>Biden-Harris officials fanned out across the country – from Alabama to Alaska – and spoke directly to the American people about the actions the Biden-Harris Administration is taking to tackle inflation, lower costs for families, create good-paying union jobs, and how the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Bipartisan Innovation Act will help America win the competition for the 21<sup>st</sup> century.<br><br>See below for a sampling of what Americans are reading in the states following this week’s economic travel blitz.</p>

<p><strong><em>Transportation Secretary Buttigieg, Office of Management &amp; Budget Director Young, EPA Administrator Regan and Infrastructure Coordinator Landrieu in Louisiana</em></strong><br><br><strong>New Orleans Advocate: <a href="https://www.nola.com/news/politics/article_83d6abe6-f98f-11ec-9ba5-d752156fe333.html">Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg has list of projects from Louisiana to consider</a></strong><br>Louisiana will get its share of the more than $1 trillion in infrastructure spending that President Joe Biden and Congress are sending to states, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said Friday. “A lot of the opportunities for passenger rail are in Louisiana and the Gulf Coast,” Buttigieg said. “Part of it is funding, but part of it is having the right support for passenger rail when it’s running on lines that are owned by the freight railways. Freight railroads have a business responsibility, but they also have a legal responsibility to be good hosts to passenger rail when it’s on their metal.”</p>



<p><strong>Times Picayune: <a href="https://www.nola.com/news/politics/article_efe86b06-f98c-11ec-a560-036948ffb803.html">Shalanda Young found her way from Clinton, via Loyola and Tulane, to head federal budget office</a></strong><br>“This” was to become in March the first Black woman to serve as director of the Office of Management and Budget, a federal agency that’s little known outside of Washington but that makes spending and regulatory decisions that affect all Americans. Young was speaking Friday after appearing on a panel at the Essence Festival with two other Biden administration cabinet officials – Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Environmental Protection Agency administrator Michael Regan. [….] Asked about the one Louisiana issue that captures her attention at OMB, Young replied, “Disaster, disaster, disaster response. It is something personal to me. After Katrina, I got to work on aid as an Appropriations baby staffer. I’ve kept that interest all through my career and have worked with the Louisiana delegation to make sure Louisiana has the resources.” [….] Noting that President Biden visited Lake Charles in May 2021, in the wake of hurricanes Laura and Delta, Young said, “I get to work with someone who wants to deliver for everybody. There shouldn’t be any partisan politics in disaster response.”<br><br><strong>NOLA.com: <a href="https://www.nola.com/news/environment/article_d61a1818-f965-11ec-a9d1-9bfca44a6115.html">EPA chief says Supreme Court ruling won&#8217;t block efforts to curb climate change</a></strong><br>With the EPA taking a lead role, President Joe Biden’s administration had aimed to slash carbon emissions in half by 2030 and eventually steer the power sector toward an emissions-free goal before 2040. Regan says that goal is still achievable. The EPA is still assessing the full impact of the decision on its ability to regulate power plants, but Regan said the agency can take an even more aggressive approach against other emitters, including vehicles and the oil and gas industry. “We’ve already (enacted) the most stringent emission standards on light-duty cars, and we’re proposing more for heavy duty vehicles,” he said. “And we’ve proposed rules for methane emissions for the oil and gas industry that are the most stringent in history.” The agency is also curbing the use of hydrofluorocarbons, the climate-warming chemicals used in air-conditioners and refrigerators.<br><br><strong><em>Commerce Secretary Raimondo at SelectUSA Summit in Maryland</em></strong><br><br><strong>Reuters: <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-commerce-secretary-presses-lawmakers-greenlight-52-bln-chipmaking-2022-06-27/">U.S. commerce secretary presses lawmakers to greenlight $52 bln for chipmaking</a></strong><br><br>US Commerce Department Secretary Gina Raimondo on Monday stepped up pressure on Congress to approve US$52 billion in funding for chip makers to expand operations, warning that firms would abandon American expansion plans without the legislation … Raimondo’s warning came after Taiwan’s GlobalWafers announced plans earlier on Monday to build a US$5 billion plant in Sherman, Texas to produce the silicon wafers needed for manufacturing chips. Raimondo said the company’s CEO told her the investment was contingent on Congress approving the funding.<br><br><strong>Bloomberg: <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-06-27/taiwan-s-globalwafers-plans-to-build-chip-wafer-factory-in-texas#xj4y7vzkg">Taiwan’s GlobalWafers to Build $5 Billion Chip Plant in Texas</a></strong><br>Speaking at an investment summit Monday, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said the US currently produces 10% to 12% of the world’s microprocessor chips, down from nearly 40% in earlier years. “We took our eye off the ball,” the secretary said. “We stopped investing in chip manufacturing and chip R&amp;D. And, in search of cheap labor, we watched a lot of our manufacturing leave our shores.” The Biden administration has for months sought the passage of a bill that would appropriate $52 billion for domestic semiconductor manufacturing. The legislation would provide billions of dollars to boost research and development with an eye toward creating new technologies to help the US stay ahead of a rising China.<br><br><strong><em>Housing and Urban Development Secretary Fudge in Florida</em></strong><br><br><strong>WFOR (CBS Miami, FL): </strong><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/miami/news/us-hud-secretary-marcia-fudge-south-florida-affordable-housing/"><strong>HUD Secretary Marcia Fudge visits South Florida to get firsthand look at housing crisis</strong></a><br>Housing and Urban Development Secretary Marcia Fudge&#8217;s first stop was Lauderhill Point, a HUD apartment complex for 176 low-income families currently undergoing renovation. &#8220;It is so different when you see it for yourself, that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m here, it is important that we address the housing crisis,&#8221; she said…. The Biden administration has allocated $10 billion dollars for housing grants administered by HUD and has requested $30 billion more. Millions of dollars are headed to Florida….</p>



<p><strong>Florida Times-Union: </strong><a href="https://www.jacksonville.com/story/news/local/2022/06/27/hud-secretary-marcia-fudge-visits-jacksonville-apartments-homeless/7748240001/"><strong>HUD secretary calls Hilltop Village a &#8216;success story&#8217; following turnaround at Jacksonville apartments</strong></a><br>Local, state and federal officials convened in Jacksonville on Monday to tour several federally supported housing complexes and tout positive changes made at Hilltop Village apartments, a complex that has been rife with problems for years&#8230; During a news conference after the tours at St. Clair Evans Academy, Fudge said Hilltop has had a new management company for the last five months and work has continued on improving the complex and ridding it of a rodent infestation. Several residents of Hilltop also spoke and agreed that living conditions at the apartment complex have improved.</p>



<p><strong>Miami Herald: </strong><a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/article262956308.html"><strong>Biden’s housing chief calls Miami the ‘epicenter of the housing crisis in this country’</strong></a><br>The nation’s top housing official visited Miami on Tuesday and called the city the “epicenter” of a housing crisis in the United States. “I decided I was going to Miami, to the epicenter of the housing crisis in this country,” Marcia Fudge, secretary of Housing and Urban Development, said during a visit to Miami-Dade County’s Liberty Square complex. In Miami-Dade, HUD funding provides the bulk of the county’s $700 million budget for public housing, which includes complexes such as Liberty Square and rental vouchers under the federal Section 8 program, which subsidizes rents for low-income residents with requirements for stable rents and price caps.<br><br><strong><em>Energy Secretary Granholm in Pennsylvania &nbsp;</em></strong><br><br><strong>TribLive: </strong><a href="https://triblive.com/local/sewickley/energy-secretary-granholm-talks-western-pa-s-clean-energy-future-during-visit/"><strong>Officials say Western Pa. can lead way in clean energy industry</strong></a><br>On Tuesday, U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm visited the Pittsburgh region to meet regional leaders to discuss the Southwestern Pennsylvania’s future in the clean energy sector…First, Granholm toured a former steel factory in Leetsdale that has been converted into a solar manufacturing facility with U.S. Sen.

Buttigieg was in the city to support the $20 million project funded through the ‘Reconnecting Communities’ Pilot Program that’s part of the bipartisan infrastructure law passed last year. “It’s a major milestone that we have been working on throughout this administration,” Buttigieg said.</p>

In total, $50.6 million of the federal funding — Pathway Home grants — will “provide training and employment services to adults reentering the workforce following incarceration in a local jail or state correctional facility,” according to a press release. “These grants will help people who are working for second chances,” Walsh said. “They’re about reducing crime. They’re also about meeting the needs of the local labor markets, like here, in Little Rock.”</p>

The state also does not have a Department of Labor, and Secretary Marty Walsh with the US. Department of Labor says that places his office as the closest governing body. He is speaking with workers&#8217; rights groups across the state about the hurdles facing Mississippi’s workforce. “Hopefully, working supporting people, continuing to fight for wage equity, gender equity, pay equity, and other issue pay equity,” says Walsh. “In this country, the fact that we pay women less than men, and make excuses for whey we do that, that’s just wrong. It’s 2022, it’s time to whatever job a man has and a woman does the same exact job, she would be paid the same exact rate.”<br><br><strong><em>Agriculture Secretary Vilsack in Iowa</em></strong><br><br><strong>Iowa Capital Dispatch: </strong><a href="https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/2022/06/28/vilsack-usda-grant-program-agricultural-waste/"><strong>Vilsack announces $10 million grant program to develop new uses for ag waste</strong></a><br>U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack, during an eastern Iowa visit Tuesday, announced a $10 million initiative to help farms and businesses find uses for waste byproducts.

<p><strong>Cedar Rapids Gazette: </strong><a href="https://www.thegazette.com/government-politics/vilsack-announces-10m-grant-program-to-find-uses-for-ag-waste/"><strong>Vilsack announces $10M grant program to find uses for ag waste</strong></a><br>For U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack, infrastructure is not just about investing in roads and bridges and broadband internet. It’s also about investing in the future and inspiring innovation, he says… At an event Tuesday at Dan and Debbie’s Creamery in Ely, the head of the U.S. Department of Agriculture and former Iowa governor announced funding for a program created under the $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill signed into law by President Joe Biden.</p>

After stops in Little Rock, Arkansas, and Greenville, Walsh, the former mayor of Boston, spoke to a room of nearly 100 people on the struggles many in the Mid-South and across the nation are facing regarding workplace rights, compensation and conditions. He made note of the H-2A Visa Program, which is meant to help employers find workers where there aren’t enough workers. Instead, in the Mississippi Delta, Walsh said farmers are using the program to bring in foreign workers at a lower wage to replace Black farm workers who have been in place for many years. Walsh said that in his role as Labor Secretary, he wants to help make life better for people and hopes honest dialogue will help educate people in the South and the rest of the country. “I am taking much of this back with me to Washington, D.C., and see how we can make a difference,” Walsh said.</p>

Wade &#8212; a terrible, extreme decision, in my view, upending the lives and impacting on the health and safety of millions of women. <br> <br>And I share the public outrage at this extremist Court that’s committed to moving America backwards with fewer rights, less autonomy, and politicians invading the most personal of decisions of not only women but we’ll find, if they expend &#8212; expand on this decision, men as well.<br> <br>But as I said last week, this is not over.  Last week, I announced two specific actions.  First, if extremist governors try to block a woman from traveling from her state that prohibits her from seeking the medical help she needs to a state that provides that care, the federal government will act to protect her bedrock right through the Attorneys General’s Office.<br> <br>Second, if states try to block a woman from getting medication the FDA has already approved and has been available for more than 20 years, my administration will act and protect that woman’s right to that medication. <br> <br>And there are many other unlawful actions, in my view, that states are preparing to take that will have &#8212; we’ll have to address as well. <br> <br>But ultimately, Congress is going to have to act to codify Roe into federal law.  And as I said yesterday, the filibuster should not stand in the way of us being able to do that.<br> <br>But right now, we don’t have the votes in the Senate to change the filibuster on &#8212; on &#8212; at the moment.  That means we need two more votes now &#8212; not now &#8212; when we vote, probably after November &#8212; more senators and House majority &#8212; and the House majority elected in November to get this bill to my desk.<br> <br>So, the choice is clear: We either elect federal Senators and Representatives who will codify Roe, or Republicans who will elect the House and Senate will try to ban abortions nationwide.  Nationwide.  This is going to go one way or the other after November. <br> <br>So let’s remember: The reasoning of this decision has an impact much beyond Roe and to the right to privacy more generally. <br> <br>Justice Thomas himself said that, under the reasoning of this decision, that the Court should reconsider marriage equality and contraception. <br> <br>And there’s a lot at stake. <br> <br>In the meantime, I want to hear what the governors are doing, talk about my plans, and discuss what we can do as &#8212; until Congress acts. <br> <br>This is not over.  This is not over. <br> <br>Now I’m going to turn it over to Jen Klein, the head of the White House Gender Policy Council.  And we’ll proceed with the discussions.<br> <br>Jen?<br> <br>MS. KLEIN:  Thank you.  Thank you, Mr. President.  And I’d like to add my thanks to each of you for joining and for your leadership.<br> <br>We’d, as the President just said, really like to hear from you about both what you&#8217;ve done and further action that you&#8217;re planning to take.  So we&#8217;re going to start with you, Governor Hochul, from New York.  Over to you.<br> <br>GOVERNOR HOCHUL:  Thank you, Jen.  And thank you, Mr. President, for convening us with the sense of urgency that I feel that you are conveying, because this is a frightening time for women all across our nation.  A lot of fear and anxiety out there.  And I hear it from women all across the state, or they come up to me at subway stops in New York City, at farmers’ markets.  Literally, young women who never even had to think about this right are coming up and putting their arms around my neck and sobbing.<br> <br>So there is such stress out there.  So we &#8212; in the state of New York, this came the day after the Supreme Court also told us that we did not have the right to protect our citizens from people carrying concealed weapons in places like subways, in Times Square, et cetera.  So what I had to do is convene an extraordinary session &#8212; because they weren&#8217;t due back until January. <br> <br>I brought them back and, literally at 2:00 a.m. this morning, while we&#8217;re still working on the gun legislation, I changed my proclamation to say we&#8217;ll also include to give further protections for women in the state &#8212; what we call the Equality Agenda.  This will prohibit discrimination on the basis of pregnancy and pregnancy outcomes and reproductive healthcare and autonomy.<br> <br>So we&#8217;re one step closer as of this afternoon &#8212; I think it&#8217;s going to be passed by both houses &#8212; to enshrine abortion rights in our state constitution.  So as long as I&#8217;m Governor, these rights will not be rolled back.<br> <br>But we also are prepared to serve as a destination for women who will be looking to a place like New York and other states &#8212; some of my colleagues on the call &#8212; as a safe harbor.<br> <br>So even before the Supreme Court decision, I knew I had to beef up our opportunities for women to come from other states.  We allocated $35 million right off the bat to go to providers so they could hire more people, expand their space, and make sure that they can keep their staff safe from violence as well.<br> <br>And we also decided to mandate: All insurance companies doing business in the state of New York now have to cover abortion.  And I signed six bills related to protecting our providers after the decision came down.  We&#8217;ll stop the extradition of any &#8212; any search for &#8212; when our providers or a woman who&#8217;s in our state who are wanted under criminal charges.  That&#8217;s not happening in New York.  And we&#8217;re also defending our abortion providers from malpractice and other lawsuits.<br> <br>We also launched a public awareness campaign, because there&#8217;s a lot of misinformation.  Women in New York are seeing the national news; they don&#8217;t know whether their rights are protected here in New York. <br> <br>So we&#8217;re going to continue to be leaders in this fight, protect our providers &#8212; protect them from the vigilante justice, which has been unleashed by the states that are going to allow these private rights of action where they&#8217;re going to hunt down women and providers. <br> <br>This is, you know, chaos.  It&#8217;s frightening.  But also, we&#8217;re doing what we can to make sure that, you know, we are protected.<br> <br>What&#8217;s happening now: The rights of millions of women across this country are now falling on the shourder [sic] &#8212; shoulders of just a handful of states.  Just a handful of states are now going to have to take care of the healthcare of women from other states.<br> <br>So we believe as you do, Mr. President, that what&#8217;s available to New Yorkers and the other enlightened states should be available to all Americans.  And no one should have to travel.<br> <br>And that&#8217;s why, as you agree with us, Congress has to act.  And we sent a letter way back, to Congress, saying, “Please pass the Women&#8217;s Health Protection Act.  Let&#8217;s get it through the Senate.”<br> <br>So what we&#8217;re doing at the state level is key.  But I completely agree with you and I commend you, Mr. President, for standing up and talking about the fact that it is the filibuster that&#8217;s preventing the majority of senators, and it is the majority of senators who want to speak on behalf of the majority of Americans.<br> <br>But we understand our options are limited until next January, with a new Senate.  And we&#8217;re all going to be focusing very hard on that outcome because it is a matter of life and death for American women, because we do not want to go back to the days, anywhere in this country, of the back-alley abortions, which are real.  I talked to one of my neighbors down the hall who use- &#8212; whose husband used to perform these abortions before abortion was legal in New York State in 1970. <br> <br>And so this is not just hyperbole, it is real.<br> <br>So what we&#8217;re asking to help continue at the federal level: We believe that more can be done to fund family planning services more broadly to allow the providers and their clinics to have sta- &#8212; federal resources for these services, and<br>they can focus on private dollars for abortion services.<br> <br>And I&#8217;m really grateful that you&#8217;re putting an emphasis on what&#8217;s going to happen for women to be able to continue to receive abortion services by mail.  I mean, this is going to be a battle that when &#8212; that people would not have foreseen.  We want to make sure that there&#8217;s no unlawful interference.  And we have to do that to ease public concerns.<br> <br>And also, Mr. President, we&#8217;d ask that you consider your ability to use federal facilities.  What am I talking about?  Veterans’ hospitals, military bases, and other places where the federal government controls the jurisdiction in some of the states that are hostile to women&#8217;s rights, and make sure that those services can be available to other women. <br> <br>So those are just a few of the ideas that we encourage you to look at &#8212; an idea of what we&#8217;re doing at the New York State level.  But literally before close of business today, we will have the first step toward a process of changing our Constitution, which is the boldest step we can take.  And we just started that today.<br> <br>So &#8212; so thank you for convening us.  We are there to stand with you to do something that &#8212; protect a right that my mother&#8217;s generation had to fight for, I fought for, my daughter who&#8217;s in her 30s had to fight for, and now, Mr. President, I have a grand-new [sic] &#8212; brand-new granddaughter, and thank you for your note acknowledging that.<br> <br>I didn&#8217;t think we&#8217;d have to fight this battle for her generation as well, but apparently we do.  But we are ready to take on that fight. <br> <br>So, thank you.<br> <br>THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I didn&#8217;t think we would either.  I was worried we would.  But, you know, I think that a lot of the folks don&#8217;t understand what this decision means.  It means if &#8212; if you got a 11-year-old child who&#8217;s a victim of incest and finds herself pregnant, which occurs, that, you know, she can&#8217;t get choice, she &#8212; she can&#8217;t &#8212; her health can&#8217;t be protected.  You find, you know, if you&#8217;re raped, there&#8217;s no exception.<br> <br>I mean, there&#8217;s so many things that people really haven&#8217;t focused on yet, beyond the fundamental right of a woman to be able to choose. <br> <br>And so I just think that, as you pointed out, Kathy, we&#8217;re going to &#8212; it&#8217;s going to be a big deal that we get people out to vote, because here’s what&#8217;s going to happen, I predict: If we don&#8217;t &#8212; if we don&#8217;t take this &#8212; keep the Senate, increase it in the House, we&#8217;re going to be in a situation where the Republicans are going to pass a nationwide prohibition consistent with what the Supreme Court ruled.<br> <br>And so, there&#8217;s a lot at stake here.  But I&#8217;m sure glad you&#8217;re leading New York.  For real. <br> <br>GOVERNOR HOCHUL:  Thank you, Mr. President.<br> <br>THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.<br> <br>MS. KLEIN:  Thank you, Governor Hochul.  I&#8217;m now going to turn to Governor Cooper.<br> <br>GOVERNOR COOPER:  Thanks, Jen.  Thanks, Mr. President, for convening this call and for your leadership, particularly on the filibuster.<br> <br>And unlike Governor Hochul in New York, our Republican legislature is not going to amend the Constitution, but this Democratic governor is going to hold the line to protect women&#8217;s reproductive freedom in our state.<br> <br>It has really been devastating for so many, as reproductive care really has been halted in its tracks in many places across the country.  That constitutional right that women have relied on for five decades has been ripped away.  And for now, at least, where you live will determine your rights. <br> <br>So, for now, it&#8217;s up to the states to determine whether can &#8212; women can get reproductive healthcare.  And in North Carolina, they still can.  And I&#8217;m determined to keep it that way. <br> <br>Because of our location in the southeast, Mr. President, North Carolina is already seeing an influx of patients coming to our state for safe care.  According to Planned Parenthood of the South Atlantic, their clinics in North Carolina have scheduled 192 patients from out of state for the next week alone.  That means about 10,000 extra patients from out of state coming to North Carolina in the next year, mostly from states that have bans and tighter restrictions. <br> <br>And those, Mr. President, are just the numbers from Planned Parenthood.  That doesn&#8217;t include our state&#8217;s other trusted providers, so we know those numbers will be a lot higher.<br> <br>Your ZIP code should not determine your rights.  North Carolina has a law that&#8217;s going to prevent obstructing access to these clinics.  And we&#8217;re working with law enforcement to make sure that that law is enforced. <br> <br>Women and doctors should not have these politicians in the exam room with them looking over their shoulders.  And I&#8217;m going to continue to trust women to make their own medical decisions.<br> <br>Now, a large part of that, at least for North Carolina, Mr. President, is keeping enough Democratic state legislators in our state to sustain my vetoes, as they have a time and again before. <br> <br>And it also means keeping and electing more Democratic governors across the country this November.  And that is my mission as Chair of the Democratic Governors Association this year.  Because, Mr. President, governors &#8212; right now, governors really are the last line of defense.  And they&#8217;re also the first chance at progress, which you&#8217;re going to hear today, especially with this Supreme Court on such a destructive path.<br> <br>Mr. President, the stakes are high, but they have never been clearer.  We are not &#8212; we are not backing down.  We are ready to do what is needed to protect women&#8217;s health.  And, Mr. President, I urge you to do everything you can on the federal level while we work hard in the states. <br> <br>Thanks.  Thanks for this opportunity.<br> <br>THE PRESIDENT:  Well, Gov &#8212; look, Roy, you&#8217;re doing a heck of a job, and a lot of your colleagues on this call are as well.  I &#8212; I assure you that &#8212; I got off the phone today with the Attorney General before I came in.  Matter of fact, it was one of the reasons I was &#8212; excuse me &#8212; a few minutes late.  And we&#8217;re going to do everything within the power of the federal government to make sure that any attempt to obstruct &#8212; obstruct anything from travel to access to &#8212; to medicine is just not &#8212; it does not occur. <br> <br>We also, by the way &#8212; I think we’re going to have to see &#8212; and this relates to Governor Hochul as well &#8212; that funding for family planning, not &#8212; not &#8212; not for abortion, but for family planning. <br> <br>And there&#8217;s a lot we have to do, because a lot of women are &#8212; for example, a lot of the family planning has to do with whether or not a woman gets access &#8212; poor women get access to &#8212; to cancer care or things unrelated to choice. <br> <br>And so there&#8217;s a lot we have to do.  I think we can get it done.  I think the American people are with us.  And &#8212; and again, I thank you for your &#8212; for your leadership.  And I&#8217;m not being solicitous.  But you&#8217;re always there.  So, thanks, pal.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.<br> <br>GOVERNOR COOPER:  Thank you, Mr. President.  Grateful for you. <br> <br>MS. KLEIN:  And now we&#8217;re going to turn to Governor Lujan Grisham. <br> <br>GOVERNOR LUJAN GRISHAM:  Thank you, Jen.  And thank you, Mr. President.  And I&#8217;m delighted, frankly, to join the fight with my incredible Democratic gubernatorial colleagues; that we are, in fact, that brick wall against this horrific Supreme Court decision. <br> <br>And I also, Mr. President, really appreciate that you&#8217;ve continued to lean in, that this privacy rights debate extends far beyond choice.<br> <br>And we &#8212; what we do today in the space for protecting reproductive rights absolutely should move in the direction to prepare to protect everyone&#8217;s additional privacy rights, including making sure that we don&#8217;t roll backwards on same-sex marriage and other related issues.<br> <br>So, New Mexico certainly saw this coming as a potential.  We quickly &#8212; a year ago, I signed into law repealing an antiquated, unconstitutional law that criminalized &#8212; that could criminalize abortion care and abortion providers.  That is now repealed.  We did that last year. <br> <br>And in doing that, we also increased resources for family planning, contraceptives, reproductive care, abortion, abortion care services through all of our network of providers and through state funds.  We&#8217;ll continue to do that.<br> <br>Most recently, we signed an executive order following the same kinds of efforts you&#8217;re seeing now across the country, joining Massachusetts, as an example, but now New York: this is not a place where the draconian efforts by neighboring states, such as Texas, who have stated that they will, in fact, criminalize providers.  They’re looking for providers that have multiple state operations and licenses.  And this whole notion that you can criminalize the patient, including asking your neighbors and churches to turn your &#8212; your loved ones, family members, and neighbors in.<br> <br>We will not cooperate as a state in any of those efforts or investigations.  We will not extradite.  We will provide coverage and protection for all our providers and any individual seeking abortion care and abortion services in the state of New Mexico.<br> <br>Like my colleagues, we are seeing an increase, and we are working diligently to make sure that when we say and we mean that abortion is “legal, safe, and accessible,” that, in fact, it is.<br> <br>So, as you talk about what we can do, given this Supreme Court decision and given that my colleague, like Chairman Governor Roy Cooper, not every state has a democratically led legislature.<br> <br>We are going to need the feds to think about ways &#8212; not just the FDA protection &#8212; for making sure that telemedicine is available for contraceptives and abortion care.  But, in fact, we&#8217;re going to need to make sure that through a public health vehicle, that we are, in fact, doing family planning.  We should educate people; that should be a national campaign.  We should talk about access points.  We should be using school-based health centers.  There&#8217;s a number of things that we could use your assistance and your leadership. <br> <br>And you&#8217;re already leaning in that direction, not just on preventing the criminalization, but making sure we&#8217;re talking about where resources can, in fact, go that would protect women in states that have signaled that they have no interest &#8212; in their wholesale bans &#8212; in protecting women and other populations and keeping government out of their personal, autonomous decision-making.<br> <br>Two, I agree wholeheartedly with Governor Hochul that there are more federal opportunities, and she mentioned several.  I think that our Indian Health Service Clinics could be another effective vehicle.  I will tell you that there &#8212; I&#8217;ve been reached out by a number of sovereign nations who I think would be very supportive and interested.<br> <br>I certainly can&#8217;t speak to that across the country, but they&#8217;re clear that even a new recent Supreme Court decision limiting sovereignty has the same draconian, absolute &#8212; right? &#8212; unfairness that is looking at being applied through the Supreme Court to them.<br> <br>So I think that may be yet another vehicle that we could expand that would protect women and particularly minority populations all across the country.<br> <br>We stand ready to fight hard across the country and making sure that you have what you need in Congress so that we can codify Roe v. Wade, so that your states that stand as that safe haven and brick wall will continue to do that, and support us as many women and their families all across America who are going to need us as we fight to win this battle.<br> <br>THE PRESIDENT:  Well, Michelle, you&#8217;re already standing up for folks on your neighboring states.  It matters.  It matters a lot. <br> <br>And one of the things that I&#8217;m finding is that we are looking &#8212; beginning the process &#8212; or in the process of looking at all the alternatives, including the sovereign nation question.  And &#8212; but there&#8217;s going to be a lot more that&#8217;s going to come through.<br> <br>I mean, I think people are going to be shocked when the first state &#8212; the first state that tries to arrest a woman for crossing a state line to get health services, and they’re &#8212; I don&#8217;t think people believe that&#8217;s going to happen.  But it&#8217;s going to happen and it&#8217;s going to &#8212; it&#8217;s going to telegraph to the whole country that this is &#8212; this is a gigantic deal that goes beyond.  I mean, it affects all your basic rights. <br> <br>And &#8212; so at any rate, I thank you for all you’re &#8212; all you&#8217;re already doing.  And we&#8217;re going to take a quick little hesitation here.  The press is about to leave so we can continue.  If you all have a few more minutes, I want to talk to all of you, if you can. <br> <br>And while we&#8217;re waiting, think about what you think I should be doing, if you were sitting in my seat, that I should be considering that we haven&#8217;t already considered and could be useful.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>Today, on the first annual National Wildland Firefighter Day, I join Americans across the country in expressing deep gratitude for our wildland firefighters who heroically protect our communities and natural resources from wildfires.&nbsp;<br><br>Recognizing their service and sacrifice on this day is especially important because we continue to ask more of them year after year. In the past year and a half, I’ve met firefighters in Idaho, California, Colorado, and New Mexico who work night and day to keep people safe, all while fires are getting larger, more intense, and more difficult to control because of climate change, the accumulation of hazardous fuels in our forests, and evolving land development patterns.&nbsp;<br><br>Firefighters can spend months away from their loved ones, courageously working to save lives, homes, schools, businesses, natural resources, and wilderness areas.&nbsp; Beyond fighting fires, these dedicated women and men also work year-round to protect us from wildfires before they start by doing the important fuels management work needed to reduce the likelihood of catastrophic fire. This work is tough and extremely dangerous.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s why my Administration continues to make supporting this workforce a top priority.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/30/fact-sheet-the-biden-harris-administration-acts-to-address-the-growing-wildfire-threat/">Building on what I initiated last year</a>, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law authorized historic new initiatives and resources for wildland firefighters that we are implementing now. <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/06/21/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-new-pay-raises-supports-for-wildland-firefighter-workforce-from-bipartisan-infrastructure-law/">This includes a substantial pay</a> increase, new programs to support wildland firefighter mental and physical health, and the creation of a wildland firefighter job series that will improve recruitment, retention, and opportunities for professional growth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We are also building our firefighting workforce, including converting more temporary firefighting positions to permanent jobs.  And we’re further supporting our brave firefighters by doing everything we can to help reduce the risk of catastrophic fires, including proposing a nearly 60 percent increase in hazardous fuels management funds in my Fiscal Year 2023 Budget Request, and investing another $2.5 billion in this work over the next five years through my Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.<br><br>National Wildland Firefighter Day will occur annually during the previously established wildland firefighter Week of Remembrance.  I’ve attended too many memorial services for the fallen, including almost nine years to the day, honoring 19 Granite Mountain Hotshot firefighters who died fighting the Yarnell Hill Fire in Arizona.  They were some of the strongest, most disciplined, tenacious, physically fit firefighters in the world.  So, this week we will also reflect on those firefighters who have fallen in the line of duty and renew our commitment to wildland firefighter safety.  We pause to remember them, commemorate their selfless service, and thank their loved ones for their service and many sacrifices.<br><br>May God bless firefighters and their families across our Nation. <br> </p>

<p>Yesterday, in response to the Supreme Court’s ruling in <em>West Virginia v. EPA</em>, President Biden issued a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/06/30/statement-by-president-joe-biden-on-supreme-court-ruling-on-west-virginia-v-epa/">statement</a> on his unwavering commitment to “continue using lawful executive authority, including the EPA’s legally-upheld authorities, to keep our air clean, protect public health, and tackle the climate crisis” and “tackle environmental injustice, create good-paying jobs, and lower costs for families building the clean energy economy.”<br><br>Vice President Harris <a href="https://twitter.com/VP/status/1542631060789293058">emphasized</a> that while “the Supreme Court’s misguided ruling aims to take our country backward,” through “executive authority, legislation, and state and local action, we must charge forward.” National Climate Advisor Gina McCarthy <a href="https://twitter.com/ginamccarthy46">stressed</a> that even though the Supreme Court is “siding with extreme special interests that want to dismantle our right to clean air,” President Biden will “keep moving us forward, using every tool we can to tackle the climate crisis,” and EPA Administrator Michael Regan <a href="https://twitter.com/EPAMichaelRegan/status/1542656005644902401">made clear</a> that the agency “will move forward using our Clean Air Act authority, consistent with the law, to set greenhouse gas standards for power plants.”<br><br><em>Read more about how the Biden-Harris Administration is pressing ahead:</em><br><br><strong>Time: </strong><a href="https://time.com/6192857/biden-climate-scotus-west-virginia/">&#8216;We Have to Be Creative.&#8217; How the Biden Administration Is Responding to the SCOTUS Climate Setback</a><br>[Justin Worland, 6/30/22]<br><br>Gina McCarthy, President Joe Biden’s national climate advisor . . . was surprisingly optimistic—not that the ruling would go the Administration’s way, but rather that the White House could chart a path to slash emissions even if it didn’t. <strong>“We’ve set very solid goals, we’re making significant progress on the transition to clean energy,” she told TIME on June 28. “And that is not going to live and die by the Supreme Court’s decision.”</strong> To meet the White House’s goals, she said, the Administration needs to get “creative” and find novel ways to galvanize the energy transition. That includes . . . the Administration’s engagement with the private sector, use of its own purchasing power, and use of the Defense Production Act to accelerate the production of domestic clean energy technology, she says.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>PBS NewsHour:</strong><a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/amp/show/epa-administrator-michael-regan-discusses-supreme-court-ruling-on-climate-change">EPA Administrator Michael Regan discusses Supreme Court ruling on climate change</a><br>[Interview, 6/30/22]</p>



<p>EPA Administrator Michael Regan: “Let me be clear. It doesn&#8217;t take us out of the game. <strong>We still will be able to regulate climate pollution. And we&#8217;re going to use all of the tools in our toolbox to do so </strong>. . . One tool that we will continue to look at is the authority that was in question with the Supreme Court. Again, that tool is still available. We have just lost some flexibility there . . . But it does not prevent us from continuing to make progress. And so we will have to be vigilant in terms of focusing on climate change pollution . . . We&#8217;re going to use every tool in the toolbox that we have to set and implement environmental standards that meet our obligation to protect all people and all communities from environmental harm.”<br><br><strong>Gina McCarthy on CNN:</strong><a href="https://twitter.com/TheLeadCNN/status/1542642048016293889">The Lead with Jake Tapper</a><br>[Interview, 6/30/22]</p>



<p>National Climate Advisor Gina McCarthy: “We are not giving up, we’re actually going to double down. And we know that <strong>we have the legal authority, and frankly we have the mandate of the people in the United States and across the world</strong> who want to address this challenge of climate change and do it in a way that makes positive improvements in our lives.”<br><br><strong>Gina McCarthy on NPR:</strong><a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/07/01/1109275642/has-the-supreme-court-tied-the-biden-administrations-hands-on-climate-change">Morning Edition</a><br>[Interview, 7/01/22]</p>



<p>National Climate Advisor Gina McCarthy: “The Court hasn’t tied our hands on climate change . . . <strong>it was a very disappointing decision, but it did not strip away the ability for EPA to regulate greenhouse gases</strong> . . . and more broadly, people should understand that this President didn’t come into office thinking that EPA was the sole way in which we could move forward on climate change . . . He recognized that special interests for decades have been funded by fossil fuel companies to really wage a long-term campaign to strip away all these environmental protections that keep our water and our air clean . . . but that’s why the President said we’re not just going to rely on EPA, we’re going to have a whole-of-government approach . . . we’re leaving no stone unturned . . . to invest in a clean energy future.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Richmond, VA</p>



<p>We’re here in Richmond because the President and I—and the entire Administration—care about this community. We care about your families and we want to make sure that everyone has the information they need to stay safe. So, I want to speak to the moms and dads for just a moment. </p>



<p>You know, when you become a parent, there’s a moment that we all go through: You look at that baby, with eyes like saucers and the tiniest fingers. And you feel an overwhelming sense of love, deep in your bones, and absolute terror.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because you know that this fragile life is depending on you. And from that moment on, you see dangers that you never even noticed before.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, we buy baby gates and cover our electrical outlets. We wrestle them into car seats no matter how much they complain. We make them eat their vegetables and slather them in sunscreen while they fight us with the strength of a linebacker! And after bedtime, when we’re exhausted from the day, we carefully close their bedroom door and feel a pang of gratitude.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because in that rare quiet, we know that everything is OK. That they are healthy and growing—that we are OK.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Parents, we do absolutely everything to protect our kids. And in this pandemic, you did.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many of you had to go through birth without your own parents there to help you recover. You had to quarantine with your newborn and without the friends and neighbors who could come over and give you a few hours to yourself. You wrestled tiny masks onto children who couldn’t understand them; you weighed the risk of going to crowded areas or traveling to see loved ones.</p>



<p>And you waited. You waited to feel the same relief you saw in families of older children. &nbsp;</p>



<p>I know it’s been hard. But you’ve done an amazing job. You’ve protected your baby and carried your family through this.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And now, that relief is finally here: a vaccine for our youngest children.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s been thoroughly reviewed and rigorously tested. It’s safe and effective. It’s free. And it’s available for every child in this country, as young as six months old. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, even though so many parents have been waiting for this day, I know you may have questions. So talk to your pediatrician. Get the answers that you need.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And if you decide that this vaccine is right for your child, go to vaccines.gov to find a vaccine site near you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Parents, this is your choice—and we want you to have all of the information you need to make it.</p>



<p>Parenthood and worrying go hand-in-hand. And I can’t promise you that the dangers of the world are going to become any less frightening—just wait until your kids start driving!&nbsp;</p>



<p>But with this vaccine, we can take away at least one of those worries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From the day your sweet, fragile, little baby was born, you have made the choice, again and again, to keep your child safe. This is your choice too. So, make the decision to protect your children with the same vaccine that has already saved millions of lives. Because nothing is more important than our children’s health.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s up to us to keep them safe—and with this vaccine, we can.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thank you.</p>
