<p>President Biden will host the Leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in Washington, DC&nbsp;on May 12&nbsp;and 13 for a U.S.-ASEAN Special Summit.</p>

It will build on President Biden’s participation in the October 2021 U.S.-ASEAN Summit, where the President announced $102 million in new initiatives to expand our engagement with ASEAN on COVID-19 recovery and health security, fighting the climate crisis, stimulating broad-based economic growth, promoting gender equality, and deepening people-to-people ties.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is a top priority for the Biden-Harris Administration to serve as a strong, reliable partner in Southeast Asia. Our shared aspirations for the region will continue to underpin our common commitment to advance an Indo-Pacific that is free and open, secure, connected, and resilient.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Vice President’s Ceremonial Office</em></p>



<p>10:44 A.M. EDT&nbsp;<br><br>VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: &nbsp;Okay, good morning, everyone. &nbsp;It is my great honor and pleasure to welcome President Hassan. &nbsp;I bring you greetings, of course, from President Biden as well. &nbsp;And we welcome you for this trip.&nbsp;<br><br>As, Madam President, you know, the United States feels very strongly that Tanzania is a very important partner. &nbsp;And we know, of course, and many Americans have appreciated the incredible natural wonders of Tanzania &#8212; be it the Serengeti or Mount Kilimanjaro, where many Americans have traveled and come back with stories that have lasted a lifetime in terms of the memories.&nbsp;<br><br>You, of course, in Tanzania have a vibrant multicultural society, stretching from the savanna of the mainland to the beaches of Zanzibar.&nbsp;<br><br>So, we do appreciate all that Tanzania represents, both historically and in terms of just the natural beauty of your country.&nbsp;<br><br>And over 60 years ago, we, the United States, sent some of our first Peace Corps volunteers to Tanzania. &nbsp;And the relationship, of course, has grown stronger and warmer ever since. &nbsp;And we&#8217;ve seen great progress during this time, but we also recognize there is more to do.&nbsp;<br><br>I&#8217;m looking forward to our discussion today. &nbsp;There are three areas that I know we will focus on in particular. &nbsp;One is with regard to what we will do together to strengthen democracy. &nbsp;And we welcome the progress that you have made during the course of your leadership and, in particular, the work you have done to empower women leaders in Tanzania and the work you have done to support human rights.&nbsp;<br><br>Our conversation will also cover the importance of the economic growth of Tanzania, which I know is one of your highest priorities and a main purpose for your visit to the United States. &nbsp;We welcome, of course, the attention you are giving to that and that the focus of this trip includes, in the United States, focusing on the investment opportunities as it relates to the economy as a general matter, but also in the area of tourism.&nbsp;<br><br>And your trip has also generated nearly $1 billion in new investments from companies in the United States. &nbsp;And that has and will contribute, no doubt, to the economic growth of Tanzania but, in that way, will contribute to the growth &#8212; the economic growth and jobs in the United States as well.&nbsp;<br><br>The third matter that we will discuss that has been a priority for our two nations and for the world is the issue of public health, global health, and, in particular, COVID-19 and other health issues. &nbsp;We will discuss today what we will do together to address those needs and those issues.&nbsp;<br><br>It is our strong belief that as COVID is an issue for any country, it is an issue for all of us. &nbsp;And it is with that spirit that we approach this discussion and our role, as it relates to Tanzania and the work that you are doing to address the issue of COVID, but also the work that you have prioritized around the health of women and children in Tanzania. &nbsp;So, I look forward to our conversation on that.&nbsp;<br><br>And I&#8217;ll conclude these comments by saying that our administration is deeply committed to strengthening the ties to Tanzania and to African countries in general. &nbsp;This has been an area of intentional focus and priority for both the President and for me.&nbsp;<br><br>And with that, again, welcome, Madam President. &nbsp;And I look forward to our discussion.&nbsp;<br><br>PRESIDENT HASSAN: &nbsp;Thank you. &nbsp;Thank you. &nbsp;Thank you, Madam Vice President. &nbsp;And I must say that I&#8217;m pleased to be here at the White House. &nbsp;And I thank you, Madam Vice President &#8212; I thank you, Madam Vice President, for having me here.&nbsp;<br><br>It makes more exciting to be here for obvious reason: that we&#8217;ll be able to exchange a lot of experiences in what we are doing, as you have also mentioned. &nbsp;And on that note, I bring goodwill message of friendship from &#8212; and solidarity from the government and the people of the United Republic of Tanzania.&nbsp;<br><br>And as this is the first time we are meeting in person since assumption of office, I would like to congratulate President Joe Biden and yourself, of course, Madam Kamala, and the Democratic Party for their resounding victory during the presidential election in 2020.&nbsp;<br><br>We, in Tanzania, have been following very closely that election because there &#8212; for the first time, there was a woman contesting for the vice president position. &nbsp;So, we were very inspired.&nbsp;<br><br>So, let me say that the United States and Tanzania have enjoyed excellent relation for the last 60 years. &nbsp;My government would like to see our relation grow further and strengthened to greater heights.&nbsp;<br><br>I would like to express my government&#8217;s appreciation to the U.S. government for their invaluable development assistance and great work the USAID has been doing in Tanzania over the years, particularly for socioeconomic development and in uplifting the lives of many Tanzanians through various programs and initiatives, including PEPFAR, the Presidential Malaria Initiative, Feed for Future &#8212; or Feed the Future for food security, just to mention a few of them.&nbsp;<br><br>Talking on COVID-19, my country is indeed grateful to the U.S. support in its donation of COVID-19 vaccines through the COVAX facility. &nbsp;To date, the U.S. has so far contributed close to 5 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines to my country.&nbsp;<br><br>It was just last month I had a virtual meeting with the USAID Administrator, Madam Samantha Power. &nbsp;And during our conversation, she revealed that Tanzania was one of the 11 beneficiaries of the Global Vaccine Initiative launched by President Joe Biden. &nbsp;Yeah.<br><br>So, talking on human rights and rule of law and democracy, Tanzania have made commendable strides in these areas, as you have mentioned, and we are committed to taking deliberate measures to ensure inclusion, cooperation, unity, and respect for all Tanzanians.&nbsp;<br><br>And in so doing, the political parties and stakeholders convened meetings to deliberate on collective and productive ways of running political activities in our country while, at the same time, safeguarding country’s interest. &nbsp;So, these meetings have been instrumental in contributing positively to enhancing democracy and strengthening multiparty system in our country, in Tanzania.&nbsp;<br><br>Now, talking on trade and investment, I must say that I&#8217;m excited about the prospects of promoting further trade and investment ties of mutual &#8212; for mutual benefits. &nbsp;And in &#8212; cognizant of that, we need to create an &#8212; an ease of doing business. &nbsp;And my government, in close collaboration with the private sector, has put in place better conditions and favorable environment for the private sector to thrive.&nbsp;<br><br>So, my only request here is to &#8212; for the U.S. government to encourage more the private sector from the U.S. to work with us in Tanzania. &nbsp;There&#8217;s a lot to be offered. &nbsp;We have a lot of potential. &nbsp;So, you are welcome.&nbsp;<br><br>Moreover, the government is collaboration &#8212; with the collaboration with the private sector, is in the process of enacting the Tanzania Investment Act, expected to set the tone for creating the safe lending for investors. &nbsp;So, we are creating &#8212; we are doing all what we can to make the private sector working comfortably in Tanzania.&nbsp;<br><br>Finally, Madam Vice President, I wish to inform you that while I&#8217;m here in the United States, I&#8217;ll also launch “The Royal Tour” program. &nbsp;This program is created to showcase Tanzania&#8217;s touristic and investment potentials.&nbsp;<br><br>The selection of United States, the place for launching, was not by accident. &nbsp;We are aware that &#8212; and we did it intentionally, knowing that this is where the lovers and shakers of entertainment and leisure reside. &nbsp;(Laughter.)&nbsp;<br><br>VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: &nbsp;Indeed.<br><br>PRESIDENT HASSAN: &nbsp;And that&#8217;s creating an excellent platform for the visibili- &#8212; visibility of the program across the globe. &nbsp;<br><br>Indeed, it is my hope that the launch of this program will inspire so many people to visit our wonderous country in the not-so-distant future.&nbsp;<br><br>Madam President, I once again thank you for having me here &#8212; for having me here in the statehouse, and looking forward to fruitful discussion.&nbsp;<br><br>Thank you, Madam Vice President. &nbsp;Thank you.<br><br>VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: &nbsp;Thank you, Madam President. &nbsp;Thank you, Madam President. &nbsp;Thank you.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;END &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 10:54 A.M.

<p>Together again, we will commemorate the Exodus of the enslaved Israelites from Egypt. And we will retell a timeless story about that most human quest for freedom. Redemption. Faith. Hope. And, ultimately, deliverance. A story that has brought solace and a sense of promise to Jewish communities throughout their history as they endured acts of persecution, pogroms, and even genocide. And one that inspired and empowered oppressed peoples everywhere who, even in their deepest despair, sensed that their own liberation was not beyond reach.</p>



<p>This Passover, we hold in our hearts the people of Ukraine and those around the world whose heroic stand against tyranny inspires us all. The enduring spirit of this holiday&nbsp;continues to teach us that with faith, the driest desert can be crossed, the mightiest sea can be split, and hope never stops marching towards the promised land.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To all those celebrating this Festival of Freedom, Jill and I wish you and your loved ones a Happy Passover. <em>Chag Sameach</em>!</p>

<p>Americans are getting back to work in every corner of the country in record numbers. Right now, 17 states are at or tied with the lowest unemployment rate they’ve ever had – and 20 states have jobless rates below 3%. Over the last year, the unemployment rate dropped in every state and many states have reached historic lows.&nbsp;These aren’t just numbers on a page: these are millions of Americans back at work and able to support themselves and their families with good-paying jobs and enjoy the dignity a job provides.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This wasn’t an accident: this was the direct result of my economic plan to grow the economy from the bottom up and middle out. There’s still more work to do to build on this recovery and bring down costs for working families – and my Administration is working on that every day – but we can’t lose sight of how far, and how quickly, we’ve come.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the Great Smoky Mountains in North Carolina and Tennessee, to the wonderous sights of the Grand Canyon in Arizona, to the vast hidden treasures of the Channel Islands in&nbsp;California, our cherished national parks are home to so many of those most beautiful places on Earth, places that astonish us, inspire us, and fill us with a sense of pride and belonging. &nbsp;During National Park Week, we celebrate the natural splendor of our national parks and show our appreciation for the Department of the Interior and National Park Service&#8217;s dedicated stewardship of them.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last month, our Nation celebrated the 150th&nbsp;anniversary of Yellowstone National Park &#8212; the world&#8217;s first national park and a place that holds many treasured memories for me. &nbsp;The desire to protect&nbsp;and share the indescribable beauty, bountiful wildlife,&nbsp;and natural resources of Yellowstone laid the foundation for what would become America&#8217;s national parks system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To protect our Nation&#8217;s outdoors and all of its marvels, I was proud to launch the &#8220;America the Beautiful&#8221; initiative &#8212; the first-ever voluntary national conservation effort with a goal to conserve 30 percent of our country&#8217;s lands and waters by&nbsp;2030.&nbsp; I have called for a whole-of-government approach that supports locally-led efforts to conserve and restore lands and waters across the country.&nbsp; In doing so, we will address the interconnected climate and biodiversity crises that our planet faces and also allow more people in more communities to have access to nature and the physical and spiritual nourishment it provides.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Historic investments through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Great American Outdoors Act are also allowing us to revitalize our national parks and public lands by modernizing facilities and addressing the extensive&nbsp;deferred maintenance and&nbsp;repair backlog. &nbsp;These laws also allow us to make progress on pollution clean-up, environmental sustainability, climate resiliency,&nbsp;and green energy initiatives.&nbsp; Through these important upgrades and restoration efforts, we will make it possible for more people to enjoy our national parks, today and&nbsp;for generations to come.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My Administration is working to fully engage with Tribal Nations by acknowledging their history and learning from their ancestral and modern connections to our national parks.&nbsp; By recognizing Native American Tribes&#8217; connection to this land since time immemorial and finding opportunities to collaborate on managing our shared lands and waters, we can preserve Native American Tribes&#8217; rich histories while safeguarding America&#8217;s national parks for future generations.&nbsp; The National Park Service is also working with stakeholders to connect more Americans to our national parks, incorporating the experiences, backgrounds, and history of every community that these sites represent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As part of my Administration&#8217;s efforts to advance equity, diversity,&nbsp;and inclusion,&nbsp;we have made a priority of creating equitable access to our shared natural resources.&nbsp; Through programs funded by the Land&nbsp;and&nbsp;Water Conservation Fund, such as&nbsp;the Outdoor Recreation Legacy Partnership,&nbsp;we are working with communities to develop and preserve&nbsp;green space, reinvigorating existing national parks, and expanding opportunities to forge connections between people and the outdoors, particularly in economically underserved areas. &nbsp;By&nbsp;tackling the intersecting challenges of environmental and racial justice, we will create a future where all Americans can&nbsp;enjoy everything that our national parks have to offer.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we have learned throughout the COVID-19 pandemic,&nbsp;providing easy and equitable&nbsp;access to the great outdoors is vital for our physical, mental,&nbsp;and social health. &nbsp;National parks, trails,&nbsp;and other close-to-home public spaces create opportunities for us to get outdoors, enjoy fresh air,&nbsp;and socialize or find sanctuary.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our national parks serve as a source of recreation, inspiration, and spirit.&nbsp; They are, indeed, America&#8217;s best idea. &nbsp;I encourage all Americans to take some time during National Park Week to connect with our national parks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 16 through April 24, 2022, as National Park Week. &nbsp; I encourage all Americans to find their park, recreate responsibly, and enjoy the benefits that come from spending time in the natural world.</p>



<p>     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-sixth.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-right">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.</p>

<p>Over the past year, we have seen that the American spirit of service is alive and well. &nbsp;Every day, Americans are giving their love and labor to care for seniors, help communities rebuild after disasters, support veterans and military families, tackle climate change, guide and mentor our youth, serve and strengthen the democratic process, feed the hungry, and keep communities healthy and safe. &nbsp;Tens of millions of Americans collectively volunteer billions of hours of their time each year. &nbsp;This commitment to service represents the best of who we&nbsp;are as Americans.&nbsp; During National Volunteer Week, we recognize the contributions that our Nation&#8217;s volunteers make every day and encourage all Americans to discover their path to&nbsp;making a&nbsp;difference.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We also need to call on that spirit more than ever as we&nbsp;help our Nation recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. &nbsp;For example, we need volunteers in education to help students get back on track, and I encourage Americans to support our youth by&nbsp;serving as tutors and mentors or in other critical roles. As&nbsp;we tackle the pandemic and so many other challenges, government has a&nbsp;role to play, but our Nation is stronger, more connected, and best prepared for the future when government, nonprofits, community organizations, the private sector, and the American people work together.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Volunteering also benefits the volunteers. &nbsp;People who volunteer develop new skills, build their personal and professional networks, forge a deeper connection with their communities and service organizations, and experience the joy of&nbsp;serving a larger cause.&nbsp; The opportunities to volunteer are seemingly limitless.&nbsp; Students gain real world experience, workers apply their skills to organizations that benefit from their experience and often develop new skills in the process, and older Americans improve their health and longevity. &nbsp;At&nbsp;every age and stage in life, volunteers experience the profound joy of giving back. &nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Volunteerism is also a reinforcing cycle. &nbsp;Volunteers are more likely to become further involved in volunteer groups, participate in civic organizations, attend public meetings, and&nbsp;lend a helping hand to their neighbors.&nbsp; Serving together in common purpose has the power to unite us across the lines that sometimes divide. &nbsp;As I pursue a unity agenda in the Congress, volunteering serves as a unity agenda for our national life. &nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vice President Harris and I salute all of our fellow Americans who take time to help others in need and the faith-based, nonprofit, national service, military service, and community organizations that make their service possible.&nbsp; My&nbsp;Administration is committed to encouraging and advancing volunteer service throughout our Nation and the world. &nbsp;Through AmeriCorps &#8212; a network of service programs across our country that helps meet community needs &#8212; we are removing barriers to service, expanding volunteer opportunities, and focusing on our Nation&#8217;s toughest challenges. &nbsp;AmeriCorps increased the living allowance for national service members through funding from the American Rescue Plan and is working with partners to recruit volunteers in underserved communities so that service opportunities are more accessible. &nbsp;To serve communities abroad in their response and recovery efforts from the pandemic, the Peace Corps has developed criteria and processes to return volunteers around the world.&nbsp; I encourage all Americans to learn&nbsp;how get involved by visiting AmeriCorps.gov and peacecorps.gov/volunteer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in&nbsp;me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 17 through April 23, 2022, as National Volunteer Week. &nbsp;I call upon all Americans to observe this week by volunteering in service projects across the country and pledging to make service a part of their daily lives.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this</p>



<p>fifteenth day of April, in the year of our Lord two&nbsp;thousand&nbsp;twenty-two, and of the Independence of the United&nbsp;States of&nbsp;America the two&nbsp;hundred and forty-sixth.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-right">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.</p>
