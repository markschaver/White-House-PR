<p class="has-text-align-center">The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, NY</p>



<p>No matter the words we choose or the speeches we give, the world sees the totality of who we are. The way we carry ourselves, how we put our shoulders back when times are hard, or offer a friendly smile even when we don’t agree. How we choose to show up for our communities—the small acts of kindness that are remembered long after they are offered.</p>



<p>And that includes what we wear.</p>



<p>Beautiful or dissonant, finely-crafted or thrown together—our style helps us express things that can’t be put in words. We reveal and conceal who we are with symbols and shapes, colors and cuts—and who creates them.</p>



<p>The history of American design is rich and deep. It is a story of innovation and ingenuity, of rebellion and renewal. It has often been written by those in the shadows, not recognized for their influence and art.</p>



<p>But here at the Met, their stories are told. Their voices are raised and their work can shine.</p>



<p>And that’s why I was so excited to accept Anna’s invitation to join you to celebrate this incredible exhibit and the education that is such a critical part of your mission.</p>



<p>As an English teacher, I have always believed in the power of language. But since I’ve become First Lady, I’ve been reminded that it’s only one way we communicate.</p>



<p>A few months ago, as the President was preparing for the State of the Union address, my mind was a world away. Like so many Americans, I was transfixed by the news of Ukraine, the bombings, the parents weeping over their children’s broken bodies in the streets.</p>



<p>As the State of the Union approached, I knew the only thing that would be reported about me was what I was wearing. So, I ordered sunflower appliqués—the flower of Ukraine and a symbol of hope and solidarity—and had one sewn on the cuff of my dress. It was small—but it shined against the deep cobalt-blue of my sleeve. And that night, sitting next to the Ukrainian ambassador, I knew I was sending a message without saying a word: that Ukraine was in our hearts—and that we stood with them.</p>



<p>Earlier today, I announced that, at the end of this week, I’ll be headed to Romania and Slovakia to visit our troops and spend Mother’s Day with Ukrainian families who’ve been displaced by Putin’s war. As a mother myself, I can only imagine the grief families are feeling. I know that we might not share a language, but I hope that I can convey—in ways so much greater than words—that their resilience inspires me, that they are not forgotten, and that all Americans stand with them still.</p>



<p>As we celebrate the designers and the fashion that has shaped the very identity of America, I hope it will inspire all of us to keep learning. I hope it will help us to see the beauty and art that surrounds us every day. And most importantly, I hope it will remind us to be bold and brave.</p>



<p>Thank you all for what you do and enjoy the exhibit!</p>



<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>2:44 P.M. CDT<br>&nbsp;<br>THE PRESIDENT: &nbsp;Thank you.&nbsp; Thank you, Amy.&nbsp; What Fritz is really saying looking down is, “Joe, hide your Irish Catholic enthusiasm a little bit and be more Norwegian.”&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>A generous introduction.&nbsp; You know, we got a chance to talk with the family a little bit earlier and trying to console them, and I got emotional.&nbsp; But as my Grandfather Finnegan would say, “That&#8217;s the Irish of it.”<br>&nbsp;<br>You know, I served with Fritz a long time.&nbsp; He became a good and close friend.&nbsp; I was a kid when I got elected.&nbsp; I wasn’t even old to be sworn in.&nbsp; I was only 29 years old.&nbsp; And because everything is based on seniority in the Senate, I got to hang out with folks like Fritz and Hubert long before you&#8217;d ordinarily at my age &#8212; because by the time I was there a second term, I was chairman of some major committees.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And so, I&#8217;m going to talk more today about Fritz and what he pretend didn&#8217;t exist but Fritz’s &#8212; Fritz’s sense of empathy.&nbsp; Fritz had a special way about him that I don&#8217;t think he would talk about.&nbsp; I could be wrong, but I never heard him talk about it.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>You know, there was a question that Fritz famously asked staffers who came to work for him.&nbsp; He&#8217;d say, “On the breakfast plate, what’s the difference between the eggs and the bacon?”&nbsp; Senator Smith and Klobuchar know the answer.&nbsp; (Laughter.)<br>&nbsp;<br>By supplying the eggs, the chicken made a contribution.&nbsp; The hog was fully committed.&nbsp; (Laughter and applause.)<br>&nbsp;<br>And it always surprised Fritz I knew a little about agriculture.&nbsp; Delaware, my state, has a &#8212; and the Delmarva Peninsula has a $5 billion industry: chickens.&nbsp; A lot of chickens.&nbsp; A hell of a lot more chickens than people.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s the biggest industry.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>But Fritz was always committed not merely to the work of his lifetime, which all of you are familiar with.&nbsp; Most people know, most of all, everybody was blessed to know him in this state.<br>&nbsp;<br>You know, Reverend Hart-Andersen, members of Congress and our military, distinguished guests; most of all, the Mondale family &#8212; Ted and William, and Rebecca and Chan; all the grandchildren &#8212; Louis, Amanda, Berit, Charlotte, Cassandra, Danielle; and all the dear friends of the family that are here as well, because he always talked about you all as family: I&#8217;m &#8212; I&#8217;m moved to be with you here today as an &#8212; honor one of the great giants in American history.&nbsp; And that’s not hyperbole.&nbsp; Fritz was a giant in American political history.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>You know, a great American who &#8212; but he also had a lot of great Americans write about him and write things that related to him without them even knowing it.<br>&nbsp;<br>The great American novelist Edith Wharton wrote, “There are two ways of spreading light: to be a candle or the mirror that reflects it.”&nbsp; Fritz was both the candle and the mirror, in my view &#8212; a candle spreading light and the mirror reflecting it.<br>&nbsp;<br>And today, I speak of a friend of five decades, about that light &#8212; the light of friendship and what it meant to me personally, to my family.<br>&nbsp;<br>Fritz and I first met in one of the darkest moments of my life.&nbsp; I had not intended to run for the United States Senate.&nbsp; I was involved &#8212; my state, it was a great shame, was segregated by law.&nbsp; We have the eighth-largest Black population in America as a percent of population in Delaware.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>I got involved in politics indirectly by getting involved in the Civil Rights Movement as a kid, being the only white employee in east side of Wilmington, an area called “The Bucket,” for years.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And I was asked by a group of senior Democrats would I &#8212; I was a young lawyer when I came back from law school.&nbsp; And we were the only city in America occupied by the National Guard for 10 months, with every corner being occupied by National Guard members with a drawn bayonet because of Dr. King&#8217;s assassination and the riots that took place in my home state.<br>&nbsp;<br>And I had a job with one of the oldest law firms in the state &#8212; a “white shoe,” as they used to call the law firm.&nbsp; And after being home for six months, I couldn&#8217;t do it anymore.&nbsp; And I left and tried to &#8212; sought a job as a public defender to represent the people I used to work with in the &#8212; as a kid in high school and college.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And so, I came to the United States Senate with a passion to do something about civil rights.&nbsp; And when I was elected, I ran initially for the group &#8212; with a group I joined, a group of senior members of the United States of the Delaware Democratic establishment to reform the Democratic Party, because we were more a southern Democratic Party than a northeastern Democratic Party.&nbsp; You used to be able to be joined &#8212; the Southern Governors’ Conference with the Mid-Atlantic Conference.&nbsp; And Democratic governors joined the Southern Governors’ Conference.<br>&nbsp;<br>But I couldn&#8217;t bring myself to be a Republican, even though they were more progressive because of Richard Nixon when I registered.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>But I was asked to head up a committee of younger people to try to get someone to run for the United States Senate against a guy who was a decent guy, actually.&nbsp; A little too conservative, but a decent guy.&nbsp; And one thing led to another, and I ended up being asked to run for the Senate.&nbsp; I had no intention of running for the Senate.<br>&nbsp;<br>But two years earlier, I had been elected to the county council.&nbsp; And Delaware is like a miniature Illinois.&nbsp; One county is 60 percent of the state&#8217;s population.&nbsp; So, the councilperson &#8212; I represented a district seven times as large as a state representative and three times as large as a state senator.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And I ran and won.&nbsp; I ran only to be a good soldier to try to get out Democrats voting.&nbsp; And I wasn&#8217;t supposed to win.&nbsp; The only reason I ran &#8212; I was certain I wasn&#8217;t going to rin [sic] &#8212; win &#8212; because I didn&#8217;t want to be a county councilman.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; I wanted &#8212; I was just setting up a law firm as a young senator &#8212; as a young man, I should say.<br>&nbsp;<br>And so, what happened was I won in a district that was like 55, 56 percent Republican.&nbsp; No Democrat had ever won.&nbsp; Republicans saw something in me I didn&#8217;t see: They saw someone who may want to go on and run for office beyond that, so they reapportioned me from a four-year term to a two-year term (inaudible) 65 percent district.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And I was put in a position of up or out.&nbsp; And a group of senior members &#8212; a former governor, a former United States Senator, a former congressman, and the chief justice of the &#8212; retired chief justice of the Supreme Court, whose family had more senators than any family in American history.&nbsp; And they came to me &#8212; an off-year convention.<br>&nbsp;<br>I&#8217;ll never forget I was &#8212; how classic it was. &nbsp;I was &#8212; there was a break in the convention in Dover, Delaware. &nbsp;I was at a little motel nearby. &nbsp;Had to &#8212; to go back and change with the younger people I was with. &nbsp;And I had my own room. &nbsp;And, you know, the typical kind of &#8212; you drive up to the front door, two headboards nailed on the wall, a desk nailed to the other wall, and an 8 by 10 bathroom.<br>&nbsp;<br>So I was in, shaving.&nbsp; I had my towel around.&nbsp; Man, I just got a shower and shaving, and I &#8212; there&#8217;s banging at the door. And I thought it was one of those &#8212; a guy named Bob Cunningham was with me.&nbsp; I said, “All right, all right, all right.”&nbsp; I went to the door and opened the door.&nbsp; There was a former two-term governor named Elbert –- Elbert Carvel, a former congressman named Harrison, and the state chairman, and a former chief justice.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And I&#8217;m standing in a towel, shaving, and my &#8212; (laughter) &#8212; and the rest of me stark naked.&nbsp; And I said &#8212; they said, “We want to talk to you, Joe.”&nbsp; So I said, “Well, come in, gentlemen.”&nbsp; I ran into the bathroom, take off the shaving cream, hoping I can find something to put on.&nbsp; I had nothing to put on.&nbsp; (Laughter.)<br>&nbsp;<br>So I came back out and I leaned against that desk and with a towel around me.&nbsp; I said, “Yes, gentlemen?”&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; And they said, “Joe, we just had dinner.&nbsp; We think you should run for the Senate.”&nbsp; And I said, “But…”&nbsp; And the chief justice &#8212; former Chief Justice (inaudible) said that.&nbsp; I said, “Sir.”&nbsp; I said, “I&#8217;m &#8212; I&#8217;m not old enough.”&nbsp; He said, “Joe, you obviously didn&#8217;t do very well on constitutional law.”&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; I&#8217;m thinking, “Holy God, what did I do now?”&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; And he said, “You only have to be 30 to be sworn in.&nbsp; They can elect you whenever you want.&nbsp; You’ll be 30 seventeen days later.<br>&nbsp;<br>Well, I ran, and, to the shock and surprise of everybody, I won by a staggering 3,100 votes.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>But here&#8217;s the point: I showed up on December 18th to hire staff.&nbsp; I hadn&#8217;t been sworn in yet.&nbsp; And what happened was that I had gotten a phone call that day from my fire department in Delaware.&nbsp; And they put a poor young woman on the phone who said, “You got to come home.&nbsp; There&#8217;s been an accident.”&nbsp; And she went on to tell me &#8212; the poor kid had to tell me there was an accident.&nbsp; I asked, “What happened?”&nbsp; She said, “Your wife and daughter are dead, and your two boys may not make it.”&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And, you know, the last thing I wanted to do was go to the United States Senate after that.&nbsp; We had elected a governor &#8212; a Democrat.&nbsp; He could appoint a Democrat.&nbsp; And I had my brother talking to him about who we&#8217;d appoint.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>But there was Fritz and Joan.&nbsp; They embraced me, cont- &#8212; contacted me.&nbsp; And it’s not just being nice, but bringing me in.&nbsp; They came to the hospital to see my boys.&nbsp; They helped me find my purpose in a sea of darkness and pain.<br>&nbsp;<br>And along &#8212; I was with Fritz, along with Mike Mansfield and Teddy Kennedy and a few others who all came to see me and said, “Just come six months.&nbsp; You can go home after that.&nbsp; We need you.”&nbsp; We had 58 Democrats; they didn’t need me for a damn thing.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; No, I&#8217;m serious.&nbsp; But I was so &#8212; such a rookie I thought, “Maybe they need me to organize.”&nbsp; (Laughter.)<br>&nbsp;<br>And they said, “Then you can leave.”&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And I used to show up every Tuesday at three o&#8217;clock in the Senate chamber to get an assignment from Senator Mansfield.&nbsp; Many times, Fritz would walk me over.&nbsp; And I thought all freshmen got assignments.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t know that nobody gets an assignment in the Senate.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; It wasn’t until about five months or three months in that I realized that was the case.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>But they kept me engaged.&nbsp; They helped me get up when it was easy to give up.<br>&nbsp;<br>My life changed again five years later.&nbsp; No man deserves one great love in his life, let alone two, but I met and married Jill Biden.&nbsp; I had to ask her five times.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; True.&nbsp; But being a spouse of a Senator who was relatively well known, because of the celebrity of how I got there and the accident, and inheriting two beautiful young boys wasn&#8217;t easy.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Once again, Fritz and Joan were there &#8212; were there spreading the light.&nbsp; Joan was one of the first people to reach out to Jill, and it meant the world to us.&nbsp; It meant the world.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>You just heard from my friend, Jon Meacham, Fritz was a master legislator who shone a light on those who needed it most.&nbsp; The desire to lift up others stemmed from his youth, from his service as a corporal in the U.S. Army, and those early days organizing for Hubert Humphrey in parts of Minnesota that Democrats didn’t win.<br>&nbsp;<br>Fritz learned early the power of bringing people together.&nbsp; And I know that Fritz &#8212; for Fritz, no moment was brighter than when he joined forces &#8212; because I was with him; I was just a bit player &#8212; with an African American senator from &#8212; Massachusetts Senator Edward Brooke and they passed the Fair Housing Act.<br>&nbsp;<br>I was on the same side &#8212; the same side of the chamber in the back where Fritz was.&nbsp; I remember the look on his face &#8212; literally remember the look on his face.&nbsp; Opened up neighborhoods diminished by segregation for so long.&nbsp; When the act passed, Fritz spoke on the Senate floor.&nbsp; And he said that, quote, “The words ‘justice’ and ‘fairness’ will mean more to millions of our fellow Americans than they do &#8212; will never &#8212; meant more to our fellow Americans than they do today.”<br>&nbsp;<br>That was Fritz spreading light, the light of our country, to families who had never truly known its warmth.<br>&nbsp;<br>At every stage of our lives, at every inflection point, Fritz and Joan &#8212; I apologize, as we say in the Senate, for the, you know, point of personal privilege here &#8212; but they were there for Jill and me and my family &#8212; not on a political level, but on a personal level.&nbsp; It was true that my &#8212; first days in the Senate when I needed help very badly, and it was true in my last days in the Senate as well.<br>&nbsp;<br>In 2008 &#8212; and Fritz and I had become close friends, and I sought his counsel many times &#8212; I was asked to join the ticket with Barack Obama.<br>&nbsp;<br>I was, as I usually was, on Amtrak going home.&nbsp; I commuted every day.&nbsp; They later told me over 1,200,000 miles on Amtrak.&nbsp; They should name a station or something after me.&nbsp; (Laughter.)<br>&nbsp;<br>But all kidding aside, he called me after it was clear he was the de facto nominee.&nbsp; And he said he&#8217;d liked me to join him on the ticket, at least consider it; could he do a background check on me.&nbsp; You know, we have to do that background check.&nbsp; And I said, “No thanks, Barack.”&nbsp; I thought he was just dragging that bloody (inaudible) through the Senate like president &#8212; presidential nominees do to get everybody excited and involved.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And Barack told me, “No, no, no, there&#8217;s only one other person I&#8217;m considering.”&nbsp; I said, “Barack, I don&#8217;t want to be Vice President.”&nbsp; He said, “Why?”&nbsp; I said, “Because you’re basically just standby equipment.”&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; I said, “What I want to do &#8212; I&#8217;m &#8212; I&#8217;m…”&nbsp; And by that time, I had chaired two major committees.&nbsp; I was fairly influential in the Senate.&nbsp; I said, “I can help you a lot more as a senator.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll do everything I can.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll campaign throughout the country for you.”&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Barack to- &#8212; asked me &#8212; he said, “Look, would you go home and talk it over with your family?&nbsp; Just talk it over.”&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So I did.&nbsp; I called Jill from the train on my cell phone. And when I got home &#8212; I was about halfway home when I had gotten the call.&nbsp; And when I got home, I went in.&nbsp; And the first person I called was Fritz before the family gathered in the back porch.&nbsp; And I asked &#8212; I said, “Fritz, what should I do?”&nbsp; And he went into great detail.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; I&#8217;m serious.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, he sent me a long memorandum he prepared for President Carter when they were deciding how the relationship would work.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>He told me, in essence, that the vice presidency holds no inherent power.&nbsp; None.&nbsp; Zero.&nbsp; The Vice President is merely &#8212; and it’s true &#8212; a reflection of your relationship with the President of the United States.<br>&nbsp;<br>About seven years ago, I joined Fritz at a forum in his honor at George Washington University.&nbsp; Fritz recounted that his greatest strength wasn&#8217;t his expertise in a particular policy area; it was the genuine personal relationship he built with President Jimmy Carter &#8212; a relationship built on real affection and trust.<br>&nbsp;<br>They sat down for lunch together every week.&nbsp; Fritz said, “Make sure you get a commitment from Barack: Once a week, you have lunch to discuss whatever is on either of your minds.”&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>He was the first Vice President to have an office in the West Wing, just a few steps away from the Oval Office.&nbsp; That never happened before.&nbsp; They were over in the Executive Office Building across the street.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>That was the true strength of the vice presidency he said, a strength that Barack and I replicated in our time in office and what I&#8217;m &#8212; Kamala and I are doing today.&nbsp; And she sends her regards to the whole family.&nbsp; She called me before I got in the plane. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>It was Fritz who lit the way.&nbsp; His core &#8212; at his core, Fritz embraced everybody with a belief that everyone is entitled to be treated with dignity &#8212; everybody.&nbsp; Dignity.&nbsp; Not just the right to vote, dignity.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>He was loved by the American people because he reflected the goodness of the American people, especially the people of Minnesota.<br>&nbsp;<br>You know, every senator wears on his or her sleeve the state they serve.&nbsp; But the love Fritz had for the people of Minnesota ran deeper than that.&nbsp; He loved you all, and you loved him back &#8212; it was obvious &#8212; because Fritz reflected the very best qualities of this state: the warmth and optimism that you reflect.<br>&nbsp;<br>At every turn, Fritz reflected the light of this nation, who we are and what we can be.&nbsp; He called me when I had said in the inauguration that we&#8217;re the most unique nation in all of history.&nbsp; We&#8217;re the only nation founded on an idea.&nbsp; Every other nation in the world is based on geography, ethnicity, religion, race.&nbsp; We’re founded on an idea.&nbsp; “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men and women are created equal, endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, including the right to life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness.”&nbsp; And it goes on.<br>&nbsp;<br>Fritz believed that in his gut.&nbsp; I watched him every day for over 35 years in the Senate and when he was Vice President.&nbsp; He united people, sharing the same light, the same hopes.&nbsp; Even when we disagree, he thought that was important.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>I&#8217;ll never forget, on a personal level, what it meant to have a friend like Fritz.&nbsp; Less than four years after losing Eleanor to brain cancer and just a year after losing Joan, Fritz was there to help me again when Jill and I lost our son Beau to brain cancer after a year in Iraq.<br>&nbsp;<br>I&#8217;ll never forget how Fritz reflected so much love and light into our family &#8212; again, at our darkest moments &#8212; nor will I forget coming here to Minneapolis eight years ago to say goodbye to Joan.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Most of you remember that Fritz went to the Mayo Clinic for quadruple bypass the very next day.&nbsp; He had delayed the surgery so he could be with all of us to reflect her light.&nbsp; And he put off treating his own heart because, as all you know, his heart belonged to Joan.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>As I&#8217;ve said many times &#8212; I say to the family, seeing your mom and dad together reminded me of that great line from Christopher Marlowe’s poem: “Come live with me and be my love, and we shall all the pleasures prove.”<br>&nbsp;<br>You can tell when a couple has been together a long time.&nbsp; So looks at each other with love &#8212; deep love.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>It’s been said that memory is the power to gather roses in winter.&nbsp; Well, Ted and William, your dad blessed you with an endless garden of those memories and, most of all, the memory of two extraordinary loves: a love of more than 58 years he spent together with your mom, and a love of 51 years with your sister, Eleanor.<br>&nbsp;<br>In his farewell letter, Fritz wrote that he was eager to rejoin Joan and Eleanor, two unbreakable loves.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>You know, Jill Biden wanted to do a garden at the Vice President&#8217;s Residence &#8212; a picture of which shows on the screen outside here that I&#8217;m standing in front of the Residence &#8212; so that every family that ever had lived there, there was a garden with stones and engraving on each of the stones with the name of the &#8212; the couple and the children.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>When I called Fritz to tell him about it, he came over to the house.&nbsp; And it was a summer day.&nbsp; And he wanted &#8212; he said, “Can we go in the house?”&nbsp; I said, “Of course.”&nbsp; He wanted to walk up to the third floor.&nbsp; He walked up to the third floor and then, to the end, there are bedrooms in the third floor.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And he stopped in front of a door and opened it and just stared.&nbsp; And I knew he was thinking something deep, and I went down the hallway.&nbsp; And a few minutes &#8212; a few minutes went by and he came down.&nbsp; And he said, “That was Eleanor’s room.&nbsp; I so miss her.”&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Well, they&#8217;re all together now, for all time.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, “An institution is the lengthened shadow of one man.”<br>&nbsp;<br>There is no doubt that the institution of the Senate and the institution &#8212; the institution of the Vice President reflect the profound legacy of Fritz Mondale.<br>&nbsp;<br>But it’s not a lengthened shadow we see in those places; it’s his light.&nbsp; And it’s up to each of us now to reflect that light that Fritz was all about, to reflect Fritz’s goodness and grace, the way he made people feel no matter who you were.<br>&nbsp;<br>Just imagine what our nation could achieve if we followed Fritz’s example of honor, decency, integrity, literally just the service to the common good.&nbsp; There would be nothing &#8212; nothing, nothing, nothing beyond our reach.<br>&nbsp;<br>I hope we all can be Fritz’s mirror, continue to spread his light.&nbsp; Because you know he was one of the finest men you’ve ever known, one of the most decent people I ever dealt with, and one of the toughest, smartest men I&#8217;ve ever worked with.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>You were lucky to have had him.&nbsp; (Inaudible) look at things, he was lucky to have had you.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>God bless you, my dear friend.&nbsp; Among the greatest of all Americans.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The highest compliment, my Grandfather Finnegan used to say, you can give a man or a woman &#8212; he was &#8212; the Irish of it is to say, “He&#8217;s a good man.”&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Fritz Mondale was a good man.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>3:12 P.M. CDT</p>

<p>As Muslims in the United States and around the world conclude the month of Ramadan and celebrate Eid al-Fitr, Jill and I extend our warmest wishes to all who are celebrating this joyous occasion.<br><br>Eid marks the completion of a holy month dedicated to devotion and reflection, when families and communities come together to celebrate their blessings. And Eid is also an occasion for Muslims to remember all those who are struggling or impacted by poverty, hunger, conflict, and disease, and to recommit to building a better future for all.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br>This year, as we mark Eid al-Fitr, we hold in our hearts the millions of displaced persons and refugees around the globe who are spending this sacred holiday separated from their families and unsure of their future, but still hoping for a brighter tomorrow. As a nation we must always keep faith with those seeking a better life, and uphold our commitment to serving as a beacon of hope for oppressed people around the world. And, Muslims across the United States celebrate Eid, let us renew our dedication to our foundational commitment to respecting all faiths and beliefs.<br><br>The Holy Qur’an urges people to stand firmly for justice and reminds us that we were created as nations and tribes so that we may get to know one another. &nbsp;The tradition of religious freedom for all strengthens our country, and we will continue to work with Americans of all beliefs and backgrounds to safeguard and deepen our collective commitment to this fundamental principle. This year, we will resume the tradition of celebrating Eid at the White House, and of honoring the inspiring Muslim Americans who are leading efforts to build greater understanding and unity across our nation.&nbsp;<br><br>To all those celebrating, Jill and I wish you and your loved ones a Happy Eid.&nbsp; May the spirit of community, compassion, and service we have witnessed over the last month continue throughout the year. <em>Eid Mubarak</em>!</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Washington Hilton<br>Washington, D.C.<br>&nbsp;<br>(April 30, 2022)</p>



<p>10:07 P.M. EDT<br> <br>THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.  Thank you, Steve, for that introduction.  And a special thanks to the 42 percent of you who actually applauded.  (Laughter.)<br> <br>I’m really excited to be here tonight with the only group of Americans with a lower approval rating than I have.  (Laughter.)  That’s hard to say after what we just saw.  (Laughter.)<br> <br>This is the first time a President attended this dinner in six years.  (Applause.)  It’s understandable.  We had a horrible plague followed by two years of COVID.  (Laughter and applause.)<br> <br>Just imagine if my predecessor came to this dinner this year.  Now, that would really have been a real coup if that occurred.  (Laughter.)  A little tough, huh?  (Laughter.)<br> <br>But I’m honored to be here at such an event with so much history.<br> <br>As already referenced, the very first President to attend the White House Correspondents’ Dinner was Calvin Coolidge in 1924.  I had just been elected to the United States Senate.  (Laughter.)  And I reme- &#8212; I remember telling him, “Cal, just be yourself.  Get up there and speak from the heart.  You&#8217;re going to be great, kid.  You&#8217;re going to do it well.”  (Laughter.)<br> <br>Of course, Jill is with me tonight.  Jilly, how are you, kid?  (Applause.)  I think &#8212; I think she&#8217;s doing an incredible job as First Lady.  (Applause.)  The First Lady to continue working full-time, and she does as a professor.<br> <br>She doesn’t pay much attention to the polls, though she did say the other day: Instead of introducing myself as Jill Biden’s husband, maybe I should introduce myself as her roommate.  (Laughter.)<br> <br>I&#8217;ve attended this dinner many times, but this is my first time as President.  And the organizers had &#8212; had it hard &#8212; made it pretty hard for me tonight.  Although the good news is, if all goes well, I have a real shot at replacing James Corden.  (Laughter.)<br> <br>It was great having him over at the White House the other day, just as he announced he’s leaving the show.  A great performer is going out on top after eight years in the job.  Sounds just about right to me.  (Laughter and applause.)<br> <br>And it’s tough to follow pros like James and Billy Eichner.   Billy, where are you again?  Do you &#8212; where is he? <br> <br>Well, Billy, you&#8217;re famous for interviewing &#8212; your interviewing skills.  Billy, you should know what you’re doing, pal.  You know it &#8212; you know it well.  And you should &#8212; I think you should host “Meet the Press.”  Maybe they’ll start to watch it again.  (Laughter.) <br> <br>I&#8217;ve never had &#8212; (laughs) &#8212; never had to &#8212; (laughs) &#8212; I&#8217;ve never had to open &#8212; I’ll never be &#8212; I’ll never be invited to “Meet the Press” again.  Anyway.  (Laughter.)<br> <br>I’ve never had to open before Trevor Noah.  Trevor is great.  When I was elected, he did a show and he called me “America’s new dad.”  (Laughter.)  Let me tell you something, pal: I’m flattered anybody would call me a “new” anything.  (Laughter.)  You&#8217;re my guy.<br> <br>And, folks, it’s been a tough few years for the country.  That’s one reason why it’s great to be here again.<br> <br>Everyone at the White House is so excited.  I told my grandkids and Pete Buttigieg they could stay up late and watch this show tonight.  (Laughter and applause.) <br> <br>Tonight &#8212; tonight we come here and answer a very important question on everybody’s mind: Why in the hell are we still doing this?  (Laughter.)<br> <br>I know there are &#8212; I know there are questions about whether we should gather here tonight because of COVID.  Well, we’re here to show the country that we’re getting through this pandemic.  Plus, everyone had to prove they were fully vaccinated and boosted.  (Applause.) <br> <br>So, if you’re at home watching this and you&#8217;re wondering how to do that, just contact your favorite Fox News reporter.  They’re all here, vaccinated and boosted &#8212; all of them.   (Laughter and applause.)<br> <br>And, look, Fox &#8212; Fox News, I’m &#8212; I&#8217;m really sorry your preferred candidate lost the last election.  To make it up to you, I’m happy to give my Chief of Staff to you all so he can tell Sean Hannity what to say every day.  (Laughter.)<br> <br>In fact, Ron Klain is here at the CBS table, which hired Mick Mulvaney.  Mick, on CBS?  I was stunned.  I figured he’d end up on “The Masked Singer” with Rudy.  (Laughter.)<br> <br>Amazing hire, guys.  Really quite amazing. <br> <br>Look, I know this is a tough town.  I came to office with an ambitious agenda, and I expected it to face stiff opposition in the Senate.  I just hoped it would be from Republicans.  (Laughter.)<br> <br>But I’m not worried about the midterms.  I&#8217;m not worried about them.  We may end up with more partisan gridlock, but I’m confident we can work it out during my remaining six years in the presidency.  (Applause.)<br> <br>And, folks, I’m not really here to roast the GOP.  That’s not my style.  Besides, there’s nothing I can say about the GOP that Kevin McCarthy hasn’t already put on tape.  (Laughter.)<br> <br>And, you know, at the same &#8212; at the same time, a lot of people say the Republican Party is too extreme, too divisive, too controlled by one person.  They say, “It’s not your father’s Republican Party.”<br> <br>Ronald Reagan said, “Mr. Gorbachev, tear this wall down.”  Today’s Republicans say, “Tear down Mickey Mouse’s house.”  (Laughter.)   And pretty soon, they’ll be storming Cinderella’s Castle, you can be sure of it.<br> <br>But Republicans seem to support one fella &#8212; some guy named Brandon.  (Laughter.)  He’s having a really good year, and I’m kind of happy for him.  (Laughter and applause.)<br> <br>Let me conclude with a serious word. <br> <br>We live in serious times.  We’re coming through a devastating pandemic, and we have to stay vigilant.  I know Kamala wanted to be here, for example, and thankfully she’s doing well.  You should all know she sends her best.  (Applause.)<br> <br>We’re in a time when what we so long have taken for granted is facing the gravest of threats.  And I&#8217;m being deadly earnest.<br> <br>Oversear [sic] &#8212; overseas, the liberal world order that laid the foundation for global peace, stability, and prosperity since World War Two is genuinely, seriously under assault.<br> <br>And at home, a poison is running through our democracy of all &#8212; all of this taking place with disinformation massively on the rise, where the truth is buried by lies and the lies live on as truth.<br> <br>What’s clear &#8212; and I mean this from the bottom of my heart &#8212; that you, the free press, matter more than you ever did in the last century.  (Applause.)  No, I really mean it. <br> <br>I’ve always believed that good journalism holds up a mirror to ourselves to reflect on the good, the bad, and the true.  Tonight, I want to congratulate the awardees and the scholarship winners who carry on that sacred tradition.<br> <br>We’ve all seen the courage of the Ukrainian people because of the courage of American reporters in this room and your colleagues across the world who are on the ground, taking their lives in their own hands.  (Applause.)<br> <br>And although it’s not in Ukraine, it’s <s>Russia</s> [Syria] &#8212; Mom, I&#8217;d like to meet you and Dad to talk about your son. <br> <br>We just &#8212; we just saw a heartbreaking video: Nine have been killed reporting from Kyiv &#8212; struck by a kamikaze drone strike after a shopping mall attack; shot in the neck while decounci- [sic] &#8212; while &#8212; while documenting Ukrainians fleeing; killed when Russian missiles hit the television tower in a residential neighborhood.  One journalist from Radio Liberty just killed days ago.<br> <br>So many of you telling the stories and taking the photos and recording the videos of what&#8217;s happening there, the unvarnished truth shown &#8212; showing the &#8212; the destruction and the devastation and, yes, the war crimes.<br> <br>Tonight, we also honor the legacy of two historic reporters, and that is Alice Dunnigan and Ethel Payne.  I&#8217;m glad you saw that tonight.  (Applause.)  I didn’t know you were doing that.  These are the first Black women to be White House reporters who shattered convention to cover a segregated nation.<br> <br>We honor journalists killed, missing, imprisoned, detained, and tortured; covering war, exposing corruption, and holding leaders accountable.<br> <br>We honor members of the press, both national and local, covering a once-in-a-century pandemic where we lost a million Americans, a generation reckoning on race, and the existential threat of climate change.<br> <br>The free press is not the enemy of the people &#8212; far from it.  At your best, you’re guardians of the truth.<br> <br>President Kennedy once said, and I quote, “Without debate, without criticism, no administration, no country can succeed,<br>and no republic can survive.”<br> <br>The First Amendment grants a free press extraordinary protection, but with it comes, as many of you know, a very heavy obligation: to seek the truth as best you can &#8212; not to inflame or entertain, but to illuminate and educate.<br> <br>I know it’s tough.  And I&#8217;m not being solicitous.  The industry is changing significantly.<br> <br>There’s incredible pressure on you all to deliver heat instead of shed light, because the technology is changing so much, the system is changing.  But it matters.  No kidding.  It matters.  The truth matters. <br> <br>American democracy is not a reality show.  (Applause.)  It’s not a reality show.  (Applause.)  It’s reality itself.  And the reality is that we are a great country.<br> <br>Our future is bright.  It’s not guaranteed, because democracy is never guaranteed.  It has to be earned.  It has to be defended.  It has to be protected.<br> <br>As you’ve heard me say many times: There&#8217;s not a damn thing this country can&#8217;t do when we stand united and do it together.  And I know we can do anything we want to do that’s right. <br> <br>I’ve been around a long time, as has been pointed out many times tonight.  (Laughter.)  But I give you my word as a Biden: I’ve never been more optimistic about America than I am today.  I really mean it. <br> <br>At times of enormous change, it presents enormous opportunities.  For despite all the crises, all the partisanship, all the shouting and the showmanship,<br>I really know this and you know it too: We are a great nation because we’re basically a good people.<br> <br>And here in America, good journalism, good satire about our leaders, about our society is quintessentially an American thing.  It demonstrates the power of our example.<br> <br>And I, honest to God, believe it reveals our soul &#8212; the soul of our nation.  And that’s what I’d like to toast tonight, if I may.<br> <br>(The President offers a toast.)<br> <br>To the journalists and their families, to the people and their elected representatives, to the United States of America.  (Applause.)<br> <br>And by the way, Madeleine Albright was right: We are the indispensable nation.  (Applause.)<br> <br>Ladies and gentlemen, I&#8217;m going to turn this over to Trevor now, strap myself into my seat.  (Laughter.)<br> <br>And, Trevor, the really good news is: Now you get to roast the President of the United States and, unlike in Moscow, you won’t go to jail.  (Laughter.)<br> <br>The podium is yours.  (Applause.)</p>

<p>President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. spoke today with President Andrés Manuel López Obrador to reaffirm the vision they laid out in the November 2021 North American Leaders’ Summit of a North America that remains the most competitive and dynamic region in the world.</p>



<p>At a time of immense global challenges, from Russia’s further invasion of Ukraine to economic volatility, the Leaders pledged to work together across the breadth and depth of the relationship between our nations.&nbsp; President Biden and President López Obrador discussed how our countries can continue to advance our shared economic, climate, energy, and migration management goals in line with the <a href="https://trade.gov/HLED">High-Level Economic Dialogue</a>, with a special focus on shoring up North American supply chains.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They discussed their visions for the Summit of the Americas and emphasized ongoing cooperation on <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/04/19/fact-sheet-update-on-the-u-s-strategy-for-addressing-the-root-causes-of-migration-in-central-america/">development in Central America</a> and southern Mexico, strengthening North American supply chains, and modernizing our shared border to further strengthen our agricultural and commercial trade.&nbsp; They also recognized the importance of joint efforts underway to fast-track the development and implementation of key infrastructure projects on both sides of the 2,000 mile U.S.-Mexico border.</p>



<p>In view of the unprecedented flows of migrants from throughout the hemisphere to our two countries, the Presidents reiterated the need to build stronger tools for managing regional migration surges.  To that end, they agreed to enhance our collaboration to support just, humane and effective efforts to reduce irregular migration and to advance our shared goal that countries throughout the region improve their ability to manage their borders in furtherance of humanitarian and security objectives.  They discussed the importance of working together with countries throughout the hemisphere to ensure safe and sustainable livelihoods for their respective citizens and migrant populations, to advance our partnership to create jobs in Central America, and support efforts to expand legal pathways for migrants and refugees.</p>



<p>As President Biden and President López Obrador celebrate that December 12, 2022 marks the 200<sup>th</sup> anniversary of official U.S.-Mexico diplomatic relations, they both recognized that our shared history and shared communities create the strong foundation for friendship and cooperation into the future.  They looked forward to meeting again at the June Summit of the Americas.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">State Dining Room</p>



<p>3:34 P.M. EDT</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Well, look, you know, I want to thank you all for being here and for your updates.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When you’re &#8212; these are some of the &#8212; the Recovery Act was about $900 billion and the President used to always &#8212; President Obama used to like to always kid with me when he did the State of the Union message.&nbsp; He’d never tell me what he was going to say because I presided over the &#8212; the joint session as Vice President.&nbsp; And when we &#8212; it was a big gamble to decide we were going to spend $900 billion trying to get the economy back on its feet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And the President said, “And, by the way, we’re going to make sure I’m turning it over to Joe.”&nbsp; And he started calling me “Sheriff Joe.”&nbsp; Well, the first thing I did was go to Earl Devaney and other inspectors general and said, “Look, we’re going to need a lot of work here.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because, look, the one thing I’ve learned &#8212; and you did when you were the mayor &#8212; and &#8212; is that people expect us to do what we say, and they don’t always get what they expect from elected officials.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, for example, when the CARES Act was passed in the last administration, it was &#8212; it was a very meaningful piece of legislation.&nbsp; But the first thing the President did in the time &#8212; I was hollering a lot about it &#8212; was he fired the inspector general.&nbsp; There was one put in who was just fired.&nbsp; No inspector general had independent access.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What the hell happened?&nbsp; They found out an awful lot of people were getting employment checks that didn&#8217;t deserve unemployment checks.&nbsp; They were making money, and an awful lot of people &#8212; and the list went on.&nbsp; There was a lot of fraud.</p>



<p>And so &#8212; and I should acknowledge that &#8212; Earl Devaney.&nbsp; Earl was a stand-up guy.&nbsp; And I would meet with Earl once a week.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t &#8212; I did not tell Earl what to do.&nbsp; But I found out from Earl what was happening, because he had carte blanche to know how every penny was being spent.</p>



<p>And &#8212; and when we came along with the two large pieces of legislation that tried to keep us &#8212; get us through the pandemic as well as bringing the economy back on its feet, it was clear to me that we were going to need the kind of oversight, and that&#8217;s why I called Gene.&nbsp; And I asked Gene to come in and be a coordinator of this.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, you know, the &#8212; an example &#8212; his example &#8212; I think, Earl’s example is a reminder that the end result of independent analysis of whether it was waste and fraud in the effort to distribute that money through the $900 billion in the Recovery Act was independent analysis indicated that there were less than two tenths of 1 percent of waste, fraud, or abuse &#8212; less than two tenths.</p>



<p>It was heralded as one of the most well-run programs in American history, in terms of size, scope, and did it do what it said it was going to do.</p>



<p>And &#8212; unfortunately, I earned the name from the &#8212; from the President when he said from the podium that I’m &#8212; you know, that “Sheriff Joe is going to be in charge.”&nbsp; I never thought of myself as a sheriff.</p>



<p>But it’s not the way to get things done not having really serious oversight.&nbsp; These programs are large.&nbsp; They’re consequential.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, you know, in my administration, the watchdogs are back.&nbsp; You’re looking at them all here.&nbsp; All of you.&nbsp; And I really mean it.&nbsp; Look.</p>



<p>And it&#8217;s not just whether or not there is fraud going on or wasteful spending.&nbsp; I think I told Gene when I asked him to come in &#8212; was that I&#8217;d get phone calls &#8212; I get inspector generals telling me that the way they were going to spend the money that was in the recovery plan was that they were going to build a frisbee park in such and such a place.</p>



<p>And I said, “No, you&#8217;re not.”&nbsp; I’d call &#8212; I’d pick up &#8212; as the Vice President, pick up the phone and call the governor, the mayor, whomever it was.&nbsp; And I’d say, “You’re not going to do that.”&nbsp; And he’d say, “Well, we can.&nbsp; You can’t stop me.&nbsp; Under the law, I’m able to do it.”</p>



<p>And I’d say, “No, you’re right.&nbsp; I can’t.&nbsp; But I’m going to call &#8212; come out to your city and I’m going to call a press conference and say you’re wasting money on a frisbee park.”&nbsp; Well, son a gun, they didn’t build a frisbee park.</p>



<p>No, I’m not joking.&nbsp; I &#8212; I really mean it.</p>



<p>For example, one of the things that’s going to come up, we &#8212; I think this infrastructure &#8212; Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill is extremely consequential because we&#8217;ve been in a situation where we used to have the number-one infrastructure in the world.&nbsp; We now rank 13th in the world or thereabouts.&nbsp; And we can&#8217;t &#8212; we can&#8217;t be the world leader, absent having the best infrastructure in the world.&nbsp; For real.</p>



<p>And so there&#8217;s &#8212; for example, there’s a lot of money for bridges &#8212; and particularly bridges that are in disrepair, that need help.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, if there&#8217;s a bridge that&#8217;s really in trouble and it may collapse like the one in Pittsburgh did &#8212; and we knew that was going to be &#8212; it was in trouble; didn’t expect it to collapse &#8212; you know, and yet the money is being spent on a bridge that is not particularly needed but it works for the Democrat or Republican governor and mayor because it gets them to an area that they want to make sure their constituents are happy with &#8212; that their supporters are, I want to know that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I want to know where the &#8212; where the money is &#8212; technically, it can can be spent, but it may be the lowest priority in terms of safety for the bridges.&nbsp; And it goes across the board in everything we&#8217;re doing here.</p>



<p>And so, you know, the strong oversight is in how we&#8217;re going to deliver for the American people on time and on budget and making sure the investments we get to where they&#8217;re supposed to go.</p>



<p>I’ll give another example.&nbsp; There was a Midwestern state that had serious, serious problems with access off their interstate into the city.&nbsp; And they needed help, and it was clear the ramps had to be rebuilt to get into the city.&nbsp; But this particular governor decided that he was &#8212; his constituency was a rural constituency.&nbsp; He was going to put two lanes in the western part of the state to do it.&nbsp; So, I called and said, “What are you doing that for?&nbsp; You need &#8212; you badly need &#8212; you&#8217;re having accidents on this…”</p>



<p>Well, they &#8212; you know, he technically could do it, but practically it didn&#8217;t make a lot of sense.&nbsp; Now, that&#8217;s not your job as inspector generals, but your job as inspector generals is not only to remove waste and fraud, but &#8212; is the purpose of the law, from your perspective, being followed?&nbsp; Is it being wasted?&nbsp; Is it being wasted &#8212; not just the fraud, but is it a waste?</p>



<p>And, you know, your work is really essential.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s all about building trust from &#8212; in the American people that we&#8217;re going to spend their money well, that we&#8217;re going to do what we say we&#8217;re going to do.</p>



<p>And so, you know, your work is essential.&nbsp; And &#8212; and one of the things that we tried to do in both these pieces of legislation that are very large &#8212; not just to become &#8212; not just the infrastructure bill, but what we&#8217;re spending &#8212; is we tried to make sure that we demonstrate to the American people that we’re spending the money well, that we&#8217;re doing what we said we were going to do.</p>



<p>And that&#8217;s why, if you notice, I tried to make sure that the legislation was written in such a way that it would bypass general assemblies and go straight to where it’s needed.&nbsp; Because the last thing &#8212; I&#8217;ve learned over the years that if you have something &#8212; you have X billion, 100 million dollars going to a state and how its allocated has to be &#8212; gone through the state legislature, well, guess what?&nbsp; Everybody is going to get a piece of it.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not going to go where it&#8217;s most badly needed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, what we do, we&#8217;ve had funding go directly to cities, directly to the county, and directly to &#8212; be able to pass &#8212; and some of it to the state legislature.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, all of this is about the American people being able to look at what we&#8217;re doing and say, “Hm, they did that pretty well, I guess.&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; I get it.&nbsp; They didn’t waste it.”</p>



<p>And so, you know, I &#8212; I think the work you&#8217;re doing is really important.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I want to make it clear to the press that’s here: Nobody in my administration is telling the inspector generals what they have to do.&nbsp; They&#8217;re totally independent.&nbsp; They make a judgment.&nbsp; If they want to investigate something, do it.&nbsp; If we &#8212; period.&nbsp; So, let&#8217;s find out what&#8217;s going wrong and what’s going right and what help you need in order to determine if you&#8217;re not getting the information you need.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so, because I know there’s a &#8212; I’ll conclude by saying there&#8217;s a lack of &#8212; for the last 10 years &#8212; and we got to change it &#8212; a lack of, sort of, faith in government doing exactly what it says it’s going to do.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We&#8217;re going to do what we say we’re going to do, and it’s because of all of you.</p>



<p>And I’m going to turn it back to you, Mitch.&nbsp; And then we’re going to go into &#8212;</p>



<p>MR. LANDRIEU:&nbsp; Yes, sir.</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; &#8212; more detail.&nbsp; I guess.</p>



<p>MR. LANDRIEU:&nbsp; Thank you, Mr. President.&nbsp; Thank you, guys.</p>



<p>(Cross-talk by reporters.)</p>



<p>Q &nbsp;&nbsp; Your reaction to the American killed in Ukraine, sir?</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; It’s very sad.&nbsp; He left a little infant baby behind.</p>
