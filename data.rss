<p class="has-text-align-center">South Court Auditorium</p>



<p>1:29 P.M. EST</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; What Johnny didn&#8217;t tell you: He&#8217;s a breakdancer.&nbsp; (Laughs) But he&#8217;s not going to do it on the stage right now.&nbsp; (Laughter.)<br><br>Before I begin officially today, I want to thank the Made in America Director, Celeste Drake.&nbsp; I also want to acknowledge it’s her birthday today.&nbsp; And it’s really tough turning 30, so be nice to her.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;<br><br>Happy birthday, kid. (Applause.)<br><br>MS. DRAKE:&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp;<br><br>THE PRESIDENT: (Laughs.)<br><br>And, Johnny, thank you.&nbsp; Thanks to all your coworkers I just had a chance to meet before you all came in.<br><br>And I want to thank Barbara &#8212; Barbara Humpton, Siemens.&nbsp; Lonnie Stephenson, President of the IBEW &#8212; one of my closest buddies, and he&#8217;s been my friend for a long, long time.<br><br>Earlier this week, in my State of the Union Address,<br>I said there was something happening in America, starting with a historic economic recovery that we’re seeing right now.&nbsp;<br><br>Today, we&#8217;ve learned that in February, our economy created 678,000 new jobs.&nbsp; Six hundred and seventy-eight thousand new jobs.&nbsp;<br><br>And over the course of my presidency, our economy has now created 7.4 million jobs &#8212; more jobs created in a 13-month period than at any time ever before in our history.<br><br>And we&#8217;ve learned that, in February, the unemployment rate fell to 3.8 percent &#8212; down from 6.4 percent the day I took office, beginning in 2021 &#8212; which is the fastest decline in the unemployment rate in recorded history because of all of you.<br><br>And, by the way, before the American Rescue Plan passed,<br>the Congressional Budget Office didn’t project our unemployment rate to hit 3.8 percent at any time over the entire decade.<br><br>Americans are back to work.<br><br>Yes, family budgets are still tight, but a lot of Americans are getting paychecks this year more than they got last year.&nbsp; And restoring the dignity of work so they can show up at work with some pride.<br><br>You know, job gains in February were broad based across sectors, from construction to retail to manufacturing to leisure and hospitality.<br><br>The decline in the unemployment rate was broad based as well.&nbsp; In fact, the unemployment rate among workers without high school degrees fell to 4.3 percent &#8212; the lowest on recorded &#8212; that was &#8212; since we&#8217;ve been keeping records.&nbsp; 4.3 percent.&nbsp;&nbsp; It’s amazing.<br><br>Workers’ weekly earnings rose in February.&nbsp; The people in working-class sectors like transportation and warehousing saw some of the strongest wage gains.<br><br>This is what it looks like to grow an economy from the bottom up and the middle out.<br><br>Because of the progress we’ve made in fighting COVID, Americans can not only get back to work but they can going to the office and safely fill our great downtown cities again and &#8212; creating more commerce.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>With 75 percent of adult Americans fully vaccinated and hospitalizations down by 77 percent, most Americans can remove their masks, return to work, and move forward safely.<br><br>Today’s news is a welcome reminder that we’re coming back stronger as a country and as a people.<br><br>You know, we&#8217;ve been through two of the hardest years this nation has ever faced.&nbsp; The pandemic has been punishing, as many of you know.&nbsp; And some of you may know it from a personal standpoint.&nbsp; Maybe you lost someone in this process; you got up this morning and looked at an empty chair.&nbsp; Well, it’s been punishing, but we’re coming back.&nbsp;<br><br>And so many families are still struggling, though, to make ends meet because of inflation.<br><br>I understand.&nbsp; Our top priority must be getting prices under control.<br><br>Look, our economy roared back faster than most predicted,&nbsp;<br>but the pandemic meant that businesses had a hard time hiring enough workers to keep up and &#8212; production in their factories.<br><br>The pandemic also dir- &#8212; disrupted the global supply chains.<br><br>Factories &#8212; when factories close, it takes longer to make goods and to get them to the warehouse and to get them to the store, and prices go up.<br><br>Just take a look at cars.&nbsp; Last year, there weren’t enough semiconductors to make all the automobiles people wanted to buy.&nbsp; They had a lot more money in their savings accounts and in their paychecks, but they weren’t able to go out and to spend it on leisure because of COVID.&nbsp;<br><br>So, what happened?&nbsp; They decided to &#8212; they were purchasing products like everything from homes to automobiles to hard products.&nbsp;<br><br>And the price of automobiles, for example, went way up &#8212; more people seeking them and fewer being made.<br><br>And we have a choice.&nbsp; We have a choice.&nbsp; The way to fight inflation is to drive down wages and make Americans poorer or have a better plan to fight inflation: Lower costs and not your wages.&nbsp;<br><br>The more semiconductors we make in America &#8212; and, by the way, they were invented here in America.&nbsp; The semiconductor was invented in America when we went to the Moon.&nbsp;<br><br>And when we do that, when we focus on making sure that we make those again in the Unites States of America &#8212; so few are being made &#8212; we make &#8212; we make a heck of a lot more cars and you bring prices down; the supply chain is filled.&nbsp;<br><br>Investment in America &#8212; rebuilding roads, bridges, airports, ports.&nbsp; We invest in innovation in America.&nbsp; That’s exactly what we’re doing.&nbsp;<br><br>Look, as a result, we’re seeing more jobs, more hope, and we’re also seeing something else: the rebirth of pride &#8212; the rebirth of pride that comes from stamping products “Made in America.”<br><br>And we’re seeing the revitalization of American manufacturing.&nbsp; And that’s what I want to talk a little bit about for the next few minutes.<br><br>Today, companies are choosing to build new factories when, just a few years ago, they would’ve built them overseas.&nbsp; They&#8217;re investing right here in America.&nbsp;<br><br>On this very stage, we were standing before &#8212; Intel &#8212; the chairman of the board of Intel was here.&nbsp; He announced a $20 billion investment to build a sumicondecter [sic] &#8212; semiconductor mega site outside of Columbus, Ohio, creating 10,000 new good-paying jobs.&nbsp; A portion of that went to construction jobs, but the full-time jobs &#8212; the average salary in those places is going to be $135,000 a year.&nbsp;<br><br>And if Congress passes the Bipartisan Innovation Act, Intel is ready to increase their investment from $20 billion to $100 billion.<br><br>You know, as I said, we invented the semiconductor, but we haven’t been making them in America for a long time.&nbsp; We had to import them.&nbsp; We had to wait.&nbsp; It costs more.&nbsp; And that’s what I mean when I say “dealing with the supply chains”<br><br>Since I took office, companies have announced investments<br>totaling more than $100 billion in electric vehicle industry for the future, from the iconic companies like Ford, GM &#8212; new electric vehicle production; Tesla &#8212; our nation’s largest electric vehicle manufacturer; to innovate and &#8212; and inspire younger companies &#8212; like Rivian, building electric trucks; Proterra, building electric buses.<br><br>Last month, the &#8212; MP Materials, which operates only rare earth &#8212; the only rare earth mine in the United States, announced a $700 million investment by 2025 that will have fully dome- &#8212; it will have &#8212; have a fully domestic end-to-end supply chain for the magnets that are used in electric vehicle motors, wind turbines, and defense systems.&nbsp; They&#8217;re investing that money here in the United States.<br><br>And the Union Pacific Railroad announced the largest purchase of American-made battery-electric locomotives in history.&nbsp; And guess what?&nbsp; They’re built in Western Pennsylvania.<br><br>All told, the economy created 423,000 new manufacturing jobs in America, paying decent salaries, just since I entered office.<br><br>There’s also a reason this &#8212; another reason this is happening.&nbsp; We’re not waiting for others to manufacture the products we invented.&nbsp; We know what to do.&nbsp; We know how to manufacture things in America.<br><br>And today, that progress continues.<br><br>I just had a chance to visit &#8212; have a&nbsp;<s>viral</s>&nbsp;[virtual] tour of both the Siemens faci- &#8212; facilities &#8212; one in Pomona and the other in Grand Prairie, Texas &#8212; a chance to talk with some of the IBEW members working there.<br><br>Because our Infrastructure Law provides $7.5 billion &#8212; $7.5 billion &#8212; to build a national network of 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations across America.&nbsp; And it also provides $16.5 billion to modernize our power grid, how we move electricity across America.&nbsp; Companies like Siemens are investing here in the United States of America.<br><br>And you just heard from Barbara, Siemens is announcing a $54 million investment to upgrade and expand those facilities in Texas and California that develop the high-tech, high-value electrical equipment that is used in electric circuitry,&nbsp;<br>switchboards, electric vehicles, chargers out on the highways, and data centers.&nbsp; This announcement alone is going to create 300 new good-paying, cutting-edge manufacturing jobs.<br><br>Folks, America is coming back.&nbsp; It really is.<br><br>In addition to Siemens &#8212; in addition, Siemens will be building an entirely new facility to make charging equipment for electric vehicles.&nbsp; The location of that facility will be announced later this year.&nbsp; I don’t know where it is, so don’t ask.&nbsp; (Laughter.) &nbsp;A lot of my colleagues in the Congress are going to be saying, “Joe, where is going to go?”&nbsp; I don’t know.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; But it’s going to be in America and help us continue to grow our clean-energy economy.<br><br>Look, folks, when I ran and got elected, I said I wanted to&nbsp;rebuild America.&nbsp; This is what I was talking about.&nbsp; And we want to see a lot more stories like this one.<br><br>So when &#8212; with the taxpayers&#8217; dollars to rebuild America &#8212; when they’re &#8212; and that’s what they are: taxpayers’ dollars &#8212;&nbsp; we’re going to buy American.&nbsp; Buying American products to support American jobs.&nbsp; And by the way, these are the best products in the world.<br><br>The federal government spends about $600 billion a year<br>in goods and services to fulfill its responsibilities to the American people &#8212; from the Defense Department, to healthcare, to education, and beyond.<br><br>The fact &#8212; in fact, what’s happening is the federal government is Siemens’ largest customer, for example.<br><br>Most people don’t know there’s been a law on the books<br>for almost a century to make sure your tax dollars support American jobs and American businesses.&nbsp; Every administration says they’re going to use that &#8212; that law.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>But when it comes time to make these purchases &#8212; whether that’s the deck of an aircraft carrier or a ventilation system in a school &#8212; the response is often is from the &#8212; from the government: “We can’t find an American company, so we need to issue a waiver and buy the product that was made overseas” &#8212; not by an American worker &#8212; so, “Buy American” became a hollow promise.&nbsp;<br><br>Well, in my administration, “Buy American” is a reality.&nbsp; We’ve created a “Made in America” Office in the White House to oversee our efforts.&nbsp; And you just heard from Celeste who runs that office.<br><br>In my first Cabinet meeting, I told everyone that if their agency wants to issue a waiver to purchase something for their agency and what they have a responsibility for, they don’t have to use an &#8212; and they think they don’t have to use an American company, well, guess what?&nbsp; They have to come to the White House office and set up and explain to me why they have to post that request &#8212; why they have to do that.&nbsp; And they’re going to have to post the request publicly on our sites so American manufacturers and businesses have a chance to raise their hand and say: “No, no, I can do that.&nbsp; Here &#8212; here &#8212; I can do that in my shop, in my town.”<br><br>Today, we’re going even further.&nbsp; I’m announcing the biggest change in the Buy American Act in 70 years.&nbsp; Right now, if you’re manufacturing a product that gets purchased by the federal government, the law says that it has to be “substantially all”&nbsp;of that product should be made in the United States.&nbsp;<br><br>But because of loopholes over time, you know what “substantially all” means when I took office?&nbsp; If 55 percent is made in America, it’s “substantially all.”&nbsp; To me, 55 percent isn’t “substantially all;” it’s slightly over half.&nbsp;<br><br>Today, we’re issuing a rule to raise the amount of domestic content required to be considered Made in America from 55 percent to 75 percent.&nbsp; “Substantially all” is going to start meaning substantially all.<br><br>And, today, we’re also announcing a new framework for critical products where we know we need stronger, more resilient, domestic supply chains.&nbsp;<br><br>We saw it during the pandemic that supply chain disruptions<br>can put American lives and livelihoods at risk.&nbsp;<br><br>You know, when we &#8212; what &#8212; when we needed them most, we were short of masks, gowns, gloves, ventilation, and other essential health products we had to buy abroad.&nbsp;<br><br>So, we’re creating a new “price preference.”&nbsp; What this means is that if we’re identifying some product that is so critical to our national security, health, or resilience, that we’re going to create rules to allow us to pay a little more for them if they’re made in America.<br><br>We’re talking about things like semiconductors, some pharmaceutical ingredients, advanced batteries &#8212; among other things.<br><br>It’s worth it for us to ensure we have a domestic capacity to protect us from shortages and price spikes in the future.<br><br>And, yes, we’re going to keep trading with our allies and friends, and we’re going to work with them to ensure every single country can create global chokepoints for critical goods &#8212; can’t have those chokepoints.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>But we also need a resilient supply chains of our own so that we’re never at the mercy of other countries for critical goods ever again.<br><br>And by the way, when I say “Buy American,” I mean buy all &#8212; all American.&nbsp; I want to increase the share of federal spending on goods and services that goes to small businesses in America &#8212; the backbone of our country.<br><br>Last year, I released a plan to increase the number of&nbsp;<s>contacts</s>&nbsp;[contracts] that go to small disadvantaged businesses by 50 percent by 2025.&nbsp;<br><br>This means more contracts will go to Black, Brown, Native American, women-owned, veteran-owned small businesses in every state and territory, in every industry &#8212; from services to manufacturing to agriculture.<br><br>Already, we’re seeing success.&nbsp; Woman-owned businesses have won contracts to provide masks for the government, clothing for the Marines.<br><br>Veteran-owned small business are now producing specialty trucks and trailers for the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Army.<br><br>And we’re seeing other “Buy American” successes, which will allow us to make synthetic rubber gloves in Alabama, fibers that go into N95 masks in New Hampshire, shipping containers in Maryland &#8212; the list goes on.<br><br>And here’s what it all adds up to: Today, I’m placing a bet on America.&nbsp; Everyone here is going to make sure that it pays off &#8212; everyone on this stage.<br><br>What I say today &#8212; what I’ve &#8212; what we’ve seen in the past months is more reason why we need to reject the defeatist view that the forces of automation and globalization mean we can’t have good-paying union jobs &#8212; manufacturing &#8212; here in America.<br><br>Our manufacturing future, our economic future, our solutions to the climate crisis: They’re all going to be made in America.&nbsp;<br><br>And what that means to build a better America &#8212; well, it does.&nbsp; We’re going to build a better America as a consequence.&nbsp;<br><br>So, thank you all very much.&nbsp; And I thank my colleagues for being here.&nbsp; And I understand a lot of the Siemens folks are in the front row there too &#8212; welcome.&nbsp; And you thank you all in California and in Texas.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Thank you.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br><br>1:46 P.M. EST</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>As our Nation recovers and our economy continues its historic growth following a global pandemic, it is important that consumers are fully informed about their rights and the potential risks in the marketplace.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hardworking American families deserve to feel secure in the knowledge that, as we&nbsp;build back better, we are building an economy based on principles of fairness, privacy, and equity.&nbsp;&nbsp;During National Consumer Protection Week, we recommit ourselves to those basic rights, to protecting consumers, to raising awareness about bad&nbsp;actors and deceptive practices in the marketplace, and to empowering people to make informed financial decisions so that&nbsp;our economy works for everyone.</p>



<p>My Administration has zero tolerance for criminals who steal Americans&#8217; hard-earned dollars or abuse their personal information.  Particularly in moments of crisis, like this pandemic, unscrupulous individuals have tried to take advantage of struggling Americans by price gouging, stealing money, harvesting personal information, and offering false hope for economic assistance, jobs, treatments, and cures.  We are committed to halting these practices and protecting all consumers, including small businesses and gig workers, from fraud and unlawful business practices.  Our Nation&#8217;s consumer protection agencies &#8212; including the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and Consumer Product Safety Commission &#8212; work with the Department of Justice and law enforcement agencies nationwide to fight fraud, predatory practices, and data exploitation by abusers large and small.  These agencies work every day to protect consumers and ensure product safety through investigations, law enforcement actions, and free, actionable, plain-language consumer education resources.</p>



<p>Abusive practices have an especially harmful impact on communities of color, who are often targeted by bad actors.  A report from the FTC &#8212; <em>Serving Communities of Color</em> &#8212; found that people living in majority-Black and Latino communities were more likely to experience problems with credit bureaus, banks and lenders, and used car issues than those living in majority-white communities.  That is why my Administration is reviving the Government&#8217;s top consumer watchdog, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, to address racial disparities in access to loans, capital, and credit, while protecting consumers in historically underserved communities. </p>

<p>Last night, the Florida Senate passed House Bill 5, which effectively bans access to abortions after 15 weeks. This bill is extreme by any standard.  <br><br>The right of women to make decisions about their own bodies is non-negotiable. If signed into law, Florida’s bill would violate the constitutional right to abortion that the Supreme Court has recognized for nearly 50 years. It will block access to crucial reproductive health care for Floridians, with a particular impact on low-income communities, communities of color, and rural communities.<br><br>Unconstitutional abortion bans and other bills that will dramatically reduce access to reproductive care are pending in state legislatures across the country. These efforts only strengthen our resolve: The Biden-Harris Administration will continue to do everything in our power to protect access to healthcare and defend a woman’s right to make decisions about her body and determine her future.<br></p>

<p>Today’s report shows that my plan to build an economy from the bottom up and the middle out is working to get America back to work.&nbsp;Since I took office, the economy has created 7.4 million jobs. That’s 7.4 million jobs providing families with dignity and a little more breathing room. We are building a better America.<br><br>In February, the economy created 678,000 jobs, following the greatest year of job growth in American history and the fastest economic growth in almost 40 years. The unemployment rate ticked down to 3.8 percent. And, at the same time, more people are rejoining the labor force and finding jobs as we recover from the pandemic. And&nbsp;people went back to work in February across a wide ranges of industries—with jobs gained in leisure and hospitality, construction, retail, and manufacturing. In fact,&nbsp;last year has been the best year for manufacturing jobs and trucking jobs since 1994. We are making more and moving goods faster in America.<br><br>This progress is the result of the new economic approach I talked about in the State of the Union—grow the economy from the bottom up and middle out. And it’s a result of our success combatting COVID-19 and moving forward safely. While we must tackle head on the challenge families are facing with rising costs, today’s report underscores that the United States is uniquely well positioned to deal with the challenge that inflation has posed across the world as we recover from the pandemic.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Investments in U.S. Manufacturing, Historic Buy American Update Fuel a Recovery That Is Made in America</em></p>



<p>Since his first day in office, President Biden relentlessly focused on an industrial strategy to revitalize our manufacturing base, strengthen critical supply chains, and position U.S. workers and businesses to compete and lead globally in the 21<sup>st</sup> century. This whole-of-government effort is leading to an historic recovery in domestic manufacturing—since President Biden took office, the economy added <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MANEMP">375,000 manufacturing jobs</a> – the most in nearly 30 years. The U.S. economy grew at the fastest pace in nearly 40 years in 2021, and manufacturing as a share of U.S. GDP has <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/VAPGDPMA#0">returned to pre-pandemic levels</a>.<br><br>The Biden-Harris <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/commentary/transcript/brian-deese-on-bidens-vision-for-a-twenty-first-century-american-industrial-strategy/">21<sup>st</sup> Century industrial strategy</a>, Made in America policies, and transformational investments such as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law have catalyzed historic domestic investments by the private sector to bring good-paying manufacturing jobs back home. This includes nearly $80 billion in planned investments in semiconductor manufacturing and more than $100 billion in announced investments in electric vehicles, batteries, and critical minerals since 2021.<br><br>Echoing President Biden’s call in this week’s State of the Union speech, Congress must build on this historic progress by passing the Bipartisan Innovation Act. This legislation will make record investments in emerging technologies, critical supply chains, and American manufacturing to level the playing field for American workers and businesses and outcompete China and the rest of the world in the 21<sup>st</sup> Century.<br><br><strong>Today, President Biden and Barbara Humpton, President and CEO of Siemens USA, will announce that Siemens will invest $54 million in expanded domestic production and create 300 jobs manufacturing critical electrical infrastructure that supports everything from electric vehicle chargers to data centers to industrial sites.</strong><br><br><strong>Lonnie Stephenson, International President of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) will also speak to how the Biden-Harris Administration’s Made in America policies support good-paying, union jobs across the country.</strong><br><br><strong>This builds on announcements from major companies bringing production back home:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Intel announced a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/01/20/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-bringing-semiconductor-manufacturing-back-to-america/">$20 billion</a> semiconductor manufacturing fab outside Columbus, Ohio that will create 7,000 construction jobs and another 3,000 permanent jobs.<br></li><li>General Motors announced its largest-ever <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/01/25/statement-by-president-biden-on-general-motors-investment-in-michigan/">$7 billion</a> investment to create 4,000 new EV manufacturing jobs at sites across Michigan.<br></li><li>Boeing and the Qatar Airways Group announced a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/01/31/readout-of-president-bidens-meeting-with-amir-sheikh-tamim-bin-hamad-al-thani-of-qatar/">$20 billion</a> deal, including $6.8 billion to supply aircraft that will support tens of thousands of U.S. manufacturing jobs.<br></li><li>MP Materials, who operate the only rare earth mine in the U.S., announced a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/02/22/fact-sheet-securing-a-made-in-america-supply-chain-for-critical-minerals/">$700 million</a> investment to establish a fully domestic end-to-end supply chain for permanent magnets by 2025, which are used in electric vehicle motors, wind turbines, and defense systems.</li></ul>



<p><strong>President Biden will also announce the most robust updates to the implementation of the Buy American Act in nearly 70 years to ensure taxpayer dollars create good-paying jobs here at home, strengthen critical supply chains, and position U.S. businesses to compete in strategic industries.</strong><br><br>The Federal government spends more than $600 billion each year buying goods and services.<br><br>President Biden believes that when taxpayers foot the bill, that spending should invest in American workers, manufacturers, and small businesses. In his first week in office, he signed <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/25/executive-order-on-ensuring-the-future-is-made-in-all-of-america-by-all-of-americas-workers/">Executive Order 1400</a>5, <em>Ensuring the Future Is Made in All of America by All of America&#8217;s Workers</em>, initiating a review of Buy American policy and establishing the first-ever Made in America Office in the Office of Management and Budget.<br><br>Since January 2021, the Made in America Office, codified by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, has already helped agencies implement Made in America requirements, launched a new website designed to provide transparency into exceptions from Made in America laws, and created a new Made in America Council to ensure we identify the best ideas and practices from across the Federal government to implement Made in America initiatives. The actions to date implement a whole-of-government agenda designed to maximize the use of taxpayer dollars on domestic products and services, strengthen our industrial base, and create good-paying, union jobs for Americans.<br><br>This rule is also consistent with international trade laws and will bring the U.S. in line with the domestic procurement practices of peer countries. It will allow the U.S. to use its purchasing power to seed and grow new and strategic industries, while continuing our work with allies and partners to diversify and strengthen international supply chains to mitigate the global disruptions we’ve seen from COVID-19, climate change, and geopolitical conflict. &nbsp;<br><br><strong>Today’s final rule will deliver on President Biden’s commitment to “Make Buy American Real” by:</strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>Raising the domestic content threshold to 75 percent.</strong>&nbsp;Today, products qualify as Made in America for federal procurement if 55 percent of the value of their component parts are manufactured here. This final rule will increase that threshold to 60 percent this year, 65 percent in 2024, and 75 percent in 2029. This will close loopholes in the current regulation while allowing businesses to onshore manufacturing and adjust their supply chains to increase the use of American-made components. This change will create more opportunities for small- and medium-sized manufacturers and their employees, including small and disadvantaged enterprises, from all parts of the country.<br><br>To support this work, the Small Business Administration has created a new manufacturing office in its federal contracting division and agencies will work with the Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership to find and develop American sources for government needs.<br></li><li><strong>Strengthening domestic supply chains for critical goods with new price preferences.</strong>&nbsp;When President Biden took office, he signed an executive order to fortify our critical supply chains. Building off the release of the first-of-their-kind one-year industrial base reviews last week, this rule creates a framework to allow the government to apply enhanced price preferences to select critical products and components identified in a subsequent rulemaking. These preferences, once in place, will support the development and expansion of domestic supply chains for critical products by providing a source of stable demand for domestically-produced critical products.</li></ul>



<p><strong>The President’s Made in America policies are already supporting U.S. manufacturing, including small businesses, minority-owned businesses, and woman-owned businesses.</strong><br><br>Last year, the Biden-Harris Administration announced <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/12/02/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-reforms-to-increase-equity-and-level-the-playing-field-for-underserved-small-business-owners/">new reforms</a> to increase equity in Federal procurement, including increasing goals for Federal procurement, increasing transparency, and supporting new entrants to the Federal marketplace.<br><br><strong>In just the last year:</strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>American Fashion Network</strong>, a U.S.-based SBA certified woman-owned small business, pivoted from strictly commercial work to manufacturing masks for the government during COVID. Building on that experience, AFN won its first major federal contract in 2021, for $46 million in Made in America apparel for the U.S. Marine Corps and is assisting in the pioneering of gender size inclusivity with the DOD across services, including maternity.&nbsp; The apparel is manufactured Garden Grove, California which employs workers 70 workers and Rochester, New York which employs 56 workers.<br></li><li><strong>Ferrara Manufacturing</strong>, a family-owned New York City business, began making PPE for city hospitals in spring 2020. After winning their first federal contract to make millions of Made in America PPE, they later won multiple contracts with the Defense Logistics Agency to produce coats for the U.S. Air Force, Coast Guard,&nbsp;Navy, and Military District of Washington. Their apparel is manufactured in New York City’s Garment District, where they employ over 100 workers who are SEIU-affiliated Workers United Union members. In 2022, the family hopes to add 150 new manufacturing jobs in their newly&nbsp;built factory in Queens,&nbsp;New York City.<br></li><li><strong>Brothers Body and Equipment</strong>, a service-disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB) and a HUBZone certified company operates a 30,000-square foot manufacturing facility in Galion, OH. It is executing on more than $300,000 in contracts to produce equipment for the Departments of Veterans Affairs and the Army, allowing the 12-person firm to keep its doors open and recover from a 90% revenue decrease in 2021 as a result of COVID.<br></li><li><strong>Garrett Container Systems </strong>in Accident, Maryland manufactures aluminum storage and shipping containers. Awarded more than $500,000 in contracts for the Department of the Navy and the Defense Logistics Agency, the HUBZone-located business now expects to increase its workforce to more than 120 workers to deliver on contracts through FY23.<br></li><li><strong>Alkegen</strong>, a manufacturer of meltblown fiber filtration media (the critical component in NIOSH N95 respirators), recently completed expansion of its plant in Rochester, New Hampshire where its 125 employees manufacture Berry-compliant (100% Made in America) components for NIOSH N95 and surgical masks. The Make PPE in America Act, included in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, is catalyzing domestic investments like this one to make America’s health supply chain stronger and more resilient.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></li><li><strong>Showa Best Glove, Inc</strong> was awarded two contracts totaling $81.3 million by the Department of Defense on behalf of and in coordination with the Department of Health and Human Services for the industrial base expansion of 1.6 billion nitrile exam gloves per year. The production capacity is being added to Showa’s Fayette, Alabama facility to increase domestic production of nitrile gloves. Showa Best Glove, Inc. has 265 employees at its Alabama location.<br></li><li><strong>Astrobotic Technology</strong> (AB) was awarded a $236M Task Order from NASA to deliver NASA’s Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover (VIPER) to the Moon’s South Pole in late 2023.&nbsp;VIPER’s flight to the Moon is part of NASA’s&nbsp;Commercial Lunar Payload Services&nbsp;(CLPS) initiative, which leverages the capabilities of industry partners to quickly deliver scientific instruments and technology demonstrations to the Moon. As part of its award, AB is responsible for the delivery of VIPER, including integration with its Griffin lander, launch from Earth, and landing on the Moon. AB is a 160-employee certified small business firm in Pittsburgh, PA, that builds and operates space technologies.</li></ul>
