<p class="has-text-align-center">San Antonio, TX</p>



<p>Good afternoon, Unidos. It’s incredibly special to be here with you in San Antonio.<br><br>Earlier today, the White House celebrated the signing of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act—the most significant gun safety law in 30 years.<br><br>You know, when Joe and I visited Uvalde, I stood in front of those 21 crosses, and touched the pictures of the bright, beautiful faces that would never again laugh, or open birthday presents, or tell their parents that they loved them. And I knew that a piece of Uvalde would always be a part of me. <br><br>Like all of you, Joe and I think about those families—and all who carry that grief—every day.  <br><br>When we were leaving the school, someone shouted “Do something!” And I’m proud that Joe has. He will continue to do everything he can and to call on Congress to act, including on measures that ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. <br><br>We are committed to building a safer, healthier, more prosperous, and fair America. <br><br>And I know that Unidos is as well—and has been since the very start. <br><br>In fact, I was reminded of the transformational power of this organization when Joe awarded your longtime leader, Raul Yzaguirre, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, our country’s highest civilian honor. <br><br>Raul has dedicated his life to working for so many civil liberties: from fighting poverty to improving education to advancing voting rights. But one of the most powerful things that he did through this organization was to bring the Latino community together. Because he understood that unity is powerful. And he challenges us to be just as brave and bold.<br><br>It’s a reminder that we all need—now more than ever.   <br><br>A little over a month ago, I had the opportunity to give a commencement to Los Angeles City College students. The crowd was a majority Latino, but the students didn’t share one story. <br><br>There were immigrants, and first-generation Americans, and Angelenos whose families have lived on this land since long before it was called the United States. There were engineers and artists, veterans and students who are going on to four-year colleges. <br><br>They didn’t share one path or dream. But as I saw the joy in their faces, I could see that they did have one thing in common: Each of them will bring exceptional gifts and talents to their corner of our country—and will make their community stronger by being a part of it.</p>



<p>Yes, the Latino community is unique. But what I’ve heard from you again and again is that you want what all families want. Good schools. Good jobs. Safe neighborhoods. <br><br>You want justice and equality—the opportunity to build a better life for your families.<br><br>It’s not only what all families want; it’s what all families deserve. But we can’t get those things on our own.<br><br>Raul helped build this organization with the understanding that the diversity of this community—as distinct as the bodegas of the Bronx, as beautiful as the blossoms of Miami, and as unique as the breakfast tacos here in San Antonio—is your strength. <br><br>And yet, it’s when you speak with one voice—unidos—that you find your power.   <br><br>Thanks to the hard work of you and advocates across the country, we have torn down so many of the barriers that kept Latinos out of our seats of power. But your voice hasn’t always been listened to, has it? <br><br>A few years ago, I met with a group of bright, ambitious young Latino leaders. <br><br>And they told me that there were times when they didn’t feel heard. They asked me: How can our leaders work for us if they don’t work with us?<br><br>It’s an idea that’s always been at the heart of Joe’s work. If you want to know what a community needs—ask them. Give them a seat at the table and then listen to what they have to say. <br><br>And he’s done just that. He’s appointed Latinos to the highest offices in his cabinet. He made sure that legislation like the American Rescue Plan focused on equity. His team worked with all of you—Unidos and so many of the affiliates here today—to get Latinos vaccinated, fight hunger, and invest in your small businesses.  <br><br>And let me say how grateful we are to everyone who has been a partner in that work. It’s because you are on the frontlines that our team can meet Latinos and all Americans where they are. <br><br>We’ve made progress together. And I’m so proud of what Joe has done to pass bipartisan legislation, like the infrastructure and gun bills. I’m proud that he recovered all private sector jobs lost during the pandemic, reopened schools, and cut child poverty in half. <br><br>You were right to put your faith in him two years ago. But I also know that we need to do so much more. We will never make the changes we need when so many of our leaders refuse to work together. When politicians block legislation that the majority of Americans want: A ban on guns that only belong on a battle field. The right to make our own decisions about our own bodies. Universal child care, and community college, and ending child poverty. <br><br>Congress is supposed to represent the will of the people. And that’s why we the people need to speak up. All of us—united. <br><br>We need to vote—in races at every single level. And we need to remember that voting is the bare minimum. We have to get involved in the local governments that decide how cities plan their budgets and protect their students. We have to speak up for justice and equity. We have to demand that we the people be heard—to follow the example you have set.  <br><br>For decades, this organization has brought people together. You’ve built coalitions and helped this community raise its voice. You’ve envisioned a better world and done the difficult work to make it real. <br><br>You do your part every day—and Joe and I are committed to doing the same. The road ahead won’t be easy, but we’re with you in this fight—now and always. <br><br>Your longtime leader, Raul, once said: “When things aren’t going your way, you have to have something to sustain you, and having a love for your community is one thing that will sustain you.” <br><br>I see that love here today. A love that gives us the strength to speak up, even when we’re tired. That helps us come together, to cross any divide. That believes in the best of who we are—and knows that justice is within our reach as long as we never give up on each other.<br><br>Your fight is our fight and we will stand with you—in unity, equity, and love. <br><br>Thank you.   <br></p>

<p>11:08 A.M. EDT<br> <br>     THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Good morning. <br> <br>Thank you, Dr. Guerrero, for the introduction and for your courage and your compassion.  You have been such a source of strength to the families of Uvalde, and I know that is not without personal sacrifice.  Thank you for your leadership.  (Applause.)<br> <br>To our President, Joe Biden; members of Congress &#8212; (applause); members of our administration; friends and fellow Americans: Today is indeed an historic day. <br> <br>For 30 years, our nation has failed to pass meaningful gun violence legislation.  Again and again, the American people have called for commonsense action to protect our communities. <br> <br> Last month, their call was finally answered when President Joe Biden signed the bipartisan Safer Communities Act.  (Applause.)<br> <br>Because of our President&#8217;s leadership and because of so many of you, we have passed a law that will make communities around our nation safer.<br> <br>For my whole career, addressing gun violence has been one of my top priorities.  First, as a courtroom prosecutor.  Then as District Attorney of San Francisco, where we created a gun specialist unit to go after violent offenders.  Then, of course, as Attorney General, where our office worked closely with the California Bureau of Firearms to investigate and seize firearms from those who unlawfully possessed them.  As a United States senator, together with my former colleagues in the Senate, we supported various pieces of legislation to address this crisis. <br> <br>So, I knew and I know now, as so many of you do, that we are overdue in getting this work done.  And I know it will save lives. <br> <br>Together, we gather with many of the leaders who made this law a reality.  To the friends and family members of the victims of gun violence: In the face of so much pain, you have shown incredible strength, and it is a profound honor to stand with you today. <br> <br>To the members of Congress who are here with us: In the face of so much pessimism, you passed a bipartisan law.  You worked across the aisle, and the product of that work will make our communities safer.  And that deserves applause.  (Applause.)<br> <br>But as all of us know, gathered here today, we would not be here were it not for the vision, the courage, the unwavering determination of one particular individual: Joe Biden.  (Applause.)<br> <br>Our President, Joe Biden, has fought for decades to end the terror of gun violence.  He has taken on the gun lobby and won.  As a senator, Joe helped pass &#8212; then I would have called him “Joe”; now I call “Mr. President” &#8212; (laughter) &#8212; the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act &#8212; (applause) &#8212; which, as we know, is a background check system that has prevented more than 3 million firearms from falling into dangerous hands.  (Applause.) <br> <br>And he passed a 10-year ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.  (Applause.)<br> <br>As Vice President, Joe Biden led the Obama-Biden administration&#8217;s efforts to reduce gun violence. <br> <br>President Joe Biden knows the tremendous pain of gun violence.  He has seen it up close.  He has held hands with parents who lost children and with children who lost parents. <br> <br>President Biden knows the urgency of this fight, and he will continue to do all in his power to protect the people of our nation. <br> <br>And now, it is my honor to welcome Garnell Whitfield, Jr., who I spent time with and his family mourning the loss of his beloved mother.<br> <br>     Mr. Whitfield.  (Applause.)<br> <br>                               END                 11:13 A.M. EDT</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>President&nbsp;Biden has made historic progress on actions to reduce gun violence.&nbsp;To implement his comprehensive&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/23/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-comprehensive-strategy-to-prevent-and-respond-to-gun-crime-and-ensure-public-safety/">strategy</a>&nbsp;to reduce gun crime,&nbsp;the Biden&nbsp;Administrationhas taken more executive action to reduce gun violence than any other president’s&nbsp;at this point in their&nbsp;Administration.&nbsp;Today, the President is celebrating&nbsp;the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, the most significant gun violence reduction legislation&nbsp;to pass&nbsp;Congress&nbsp;in&nbsp;30 years.</p>



<p>The&nbsp;Biden Administration&nbsp;will continue to use all of the tools at&nbsp;its&nbsp;disposal&nbsp;to address the epidemic of gun violence.&nbsp;The President’s FY 2023 budget proposes $32 billion in additional funding to fight crime, including $20.6 billion in discretionary funding for federal law enforcement and state and local law enforcement and crime prevention programs, an increase of 11% over FY22 enacted ($18.6 billion) and 18% over FY21 enacted ($17.5 billion).&nbsp;</p>



<p>But there&nbsp;is so much more that can and must be done to save lives.&nbsp;The President&nbsp;will continue to urge&nbsp;Congress to&nbsp;take further legislative action to&nbsp;keep dangerous guns out of dangerous hands, including a ban on assault weapons and&nbsp;high-capacity&nbsp;magazines, strengthening background checks, and enacting safe storage laws.</p>



<p>Below are&nbsp;21 ways&nbsp;the Biden Administration&nbsp;has already used executive action to make our communities safer:</p>



<p><strong>Keeping Especially Dangerous Weapons and Repeat Shooters Off Our Streets</strong></p>



<p>1.&nbsp;The Justice Department issued a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-new-rule-modernize-firearm-definitions">final rule</a>&nbsp;to rein in the proliferation of ghost guns, which are unserialized, privately made firearms that are increasingly being recovered at crime scenes.</p>



<p>2.&nbsp;The Attorney General&nbsp;<a href="https://www.justice.gov/ag/page/file/1468291/download">directed every U.S. Attorney’s Office</a>&nbsp;nationwide to increase resources dedicated to district specific violent crime strategies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>3.&nbsp;The Justice Department issued a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-issues-proposed-rule-and-model-legislation-reduce-gun-violence">proposed rule</a>&nbsp;to better regulate when devices marketed as firearm stabilizing braces effectively turn pistols into short-barreled rifles subject to the National Firearms Act.</p>



<p><strong>Keeping Guns Out of the Wrong Hands</strong></p>



<p>4.&nbsp;The Justice Department&nbsp;published&nbsp;<a href="https://www.justice.gov/doj/reducing-gun-violence/commentary-extreme-risk-protection-order-model-legislation">model extreme risk protection order legislation</a>&nbsp;to make it easier for states that want to adopt these red flag laws to do so.&nbsp;</p>



<p>5. The Justice Department issued&nbsp;<a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-publication-first-volume-national-firearms-commerce-and">the first volume</a>&nbsp;of its new, comprehensive report on firearms commerce and trafficking.</p>



<p>6.&nbsp;The Justice Department announced a new policy to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/attorney-general-merrick-b-garland-delivers-remarks-biden-administration-s-gun-crime">underscore zero tolerance</a>&nbsp;for willful violations of the law by federally licensed firearms dealers that put public safety at risk.</p>



<p>7.&nbsp;The Justice Department launched five&nbsp;<a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-launches-firearms-trafficking-strike-forces-address-violent-crime-crack">new law enforcement strike forces</a>&nbsp;focused on addressing significant firearms trafficking corridors that have diverted guns to New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, the Bay Area, and Washington, D.C.&nbsp;</p>



<p>8.&nbsp;The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) launched a new paid media&nbsp;<a href="https://www.keepitsecure.net/">campaign</a>&nbsp;featuring a series of public service announcements to reinforce the key message that a simple gun lock can save lives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>9.&nbsp;The Departments of Defense (DOD), Health and Human Services (HHS), Homeland Security (DHS), Justice (DOJ), and Veterans Affairs (VA), as well as the Office of Emergency Medical Services within the Department of Transportation (DOT), announced that they will&nbsp;jointly create a plan&nbsp;for addressing&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Military-and-Veteran-Suicide-Prevention-Strategy.pdf">lethal means safety awareness</a>, education, training, and program evaluation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>10.&nbsp;ATF&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/01/04/2021-28398/secure-gun-storage-and-definition-of-antique-firearm">issued</a>&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-new-rule-help-enhance-safe-and-secure-storage-firearms-publishes">final rule</a>&nbsp;clarifying firearms dealers’ statutory obligations to make available for purchase compatible secure gun storage or safety devices.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Making Additional&nbsp;Progress to Reduce Community Violence</strong></p>



<p>11.&nbsp;The President called for cities and states to use American Rescue Plan funding to reduce gun crime and other violent crime, including by investing in community violence interventions and prevention.&nbsp;Through May 2022,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/05/13/fact-sheet-president-biden-issues-call-for-state-and-local-leaders-to-dedicate-more-american-rescue-plan-funding-to-make-our-communities-safer-and-deploy-these-dollars-quickly/">$10 billion</a>&nbsp;in American Rescue Plan funds had been committed to public safety and violence prevention&nbsp;– including at least $6.5 billion in State and Local funds committed by more than half of states and more than 300 communities across the country</p>



<p>12.&nbsp;Five federal agencies made changes to 26 different programs to direct vital support to community violence intervention programs as quickly as possible.&nbsp;For example</p>



<p>•&nbsp;The National Institutes of Health announced funding through its Firearm Injury and Mortality Prevention Research grants for&nbsp;<a href="https://obssr.od.nih.gov/news-and-events/news/director-voice/nih-awards-10-grants-addressing-firearm-violence-prevention">four community violence programs</a>&nbsp;– including a place-based strategy involving repurposing vacant lots in Detroit, an evaluation of READI Chicago, a burnout prevention program for violence interrupters in Chicago, and a hospital-based violence intervention program focused on youth in Virginia.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>• The Justice Department announced <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-awards-nearly-187-million-support-community-safety">$187 million</a> for states and $85 million for localities through the Byrne JAG Program to support coordinated violence prevention and intervention; the Department explicitly encouraged the use of these funds for CVI. <br></p>



<p>•&nbsp;The Department of Housing and Urban Development published a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hudexchange.info/resource/6477/cdbg-cv-community-violence-intervention-quick-guide/">guide</a>&nbsp;explaining to localities how Community Development Block Grants&nbsp;–&nbsp;a $3.4 billion annual funding stream&nbsp;–can be used to fund CVI strategies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>• The Department of Education released a&nbsp;<a href="https://oese.ed.gov/files/2021/10/21-007415-OESE-CVI-DCL-os-approved.pdf">letter</a>&nbsp;to state school associations on how 21<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;Century Learning Centers funds and Student Support and Academic enrichment programs – both billion-dollar formula grant funding streams – can be used to fund CVI strategies in schools.</p>



<p>13. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services <a href="https://www.medicaid.gov/state-resource-center/downloads/allstatecall-20210427.pdf">hosted a webinar and published information to</a> educate states on how they can use Medicaid to reimburse certain community violence intervention programs, like Hospital-Based Violence Interventions. Last year, Connecticut and Illinois enacted legislation that allows Medicaid to reimburse providers for hospital-based violence prevention services – the first two states in the country to pursue this approach. According to reporting by <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/09/17/medicaid-funds-tapped-combat-rise-crime-gun-debate-stalls/8326102002/">USA Today</a>, “[t]he idea has been in the works for years, advocates say, but not until the Biden administration signaled that states could – and should – use Medicaid dollars to support these violence prevention programs have state lawmakers stepped up.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Gordon&#8217;s Pond Trail<br>Lewes, Delaware</p>



<p>11:12 A.M. EDT</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Good morning, Mr. President.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Good morning!</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; I want you to know an important thing: I took off the clamps on my (inaudible).&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q &nbsp;&nbsp; How you feeling?</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; I’m feeling good.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Good.&nbsp; That’s great.</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; I’m looking for the sun though.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have you made a decision on tariffs, sir?&nbsp; I know you had a meeting about that on Friday.&nbsp;</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Oh, we’re having further discussions on that.&nbsp; And &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And do you have a &#8212; do you have a message, Mr. President, for women who were protesting outside the White House yesterday?</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Keep protesting.&nbsp; Because &#8212; keep making your point.&nbsp; It’s critically important.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We can do a lot of things to accommodate the rights of women in the meantime.&nbsp; But, fundamentally, the only thing that’s going to change this is if we have a national law that reinstates Roe v. Wade.&nbsp; That’s the bottom line.</p>



<p>Everything else, we can get pieces of it, and I’m trying to do that.&nbsp; Some things that some of the groups want &#8212;</p>



<p>I’m going to look like a fool here in this interview, but &#8212; (points to his bike helmet).&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You look good.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You look great.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT: &nbsp;I put a helmet on because this is a tough interview.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>But all kidding aside, I think that there’s things we can do to accommodate particular abuses beyond like not being able to cross state lines, those kinds of things, and being able to access women’s private information, and so on.&nbsp; That &#8212; we can work on that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But as President, I don’t have the authority to say that we’re going to, you know, instate Roe v. Wade as the law of the land.&nbsp; The only way we do that is through an election in the United States Congress.&nbsp; In the meantime, states can make those judgments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But &#8212; so my ultimate goal is to reinstate Roe v. Wade as the national law by passing it in the United States Congress.&nbsp; And I’ll sign it the moment that happens.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But I’m going to go on my ride.&nbsp; Okay?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, yes, Mr. President.&nbsp; One quick follow-up.&nbsp; One of the things they are asking for is a public health emergency.&nbsp; Is that something you’re considering?&nbsp; Or &#8212;</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; That’s something I’ve asked the folks to &#8212; the medical people in the administration to look at, whether that is &#8212; whether I have the authority to do that and what impact that would have.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Okay?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks so much.</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Thank you very much.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>McConnell is “Playing Politics with our National Security”</em></p>



<p>Speaking with George Stephanopoulos on ABC’s&nbsp;<em>This Week</em>, Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo pointed to legislation in Congress to build domestic manufacturing of semiconductor chips as a concrete step that needs to be taken to bring down prices for the American people. This legislation would create thousands of good-paying jobs and address the chips shortage that has driven prices higher on cars and countless other products. As the Secretary noted, Senator McConnell is now attempting to hold that legislation hostage to block another crucial effort to lower prices on prescription drugs for the American people.<br><br>The Secretary also noted that there are profound national security implications in not addressing the chips shortage, saying “He&#8217;s playing politics with our national security and it&#8217;s time for Congress to do its job on both of those dimensions.”<br><br><strong>Watch the clip:&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://twitter.com/abcpolitics/status/1546127074058031105?s=21&amp;t=S6SP7ACmRsV2YnOLwiulVQ">https://twitter.com/abcpolitics/status/1546127074058031105?s=21&amp;t=S6SP7ACmRsV2YnOLwiulVQ</a><br><br>STEPHANOPOULOS: …Is there anything more the President can do to combat inflation that he’s not doing now?</p>



<p>RAIMONDO: Well, one of the things that Ro Khanna&nbsp;pointed out in that piece is that Congress needs to pass the CHIPS Act. There’s a bill right now before Congress which Ro Khanna supports, President Biden supports, which would increase the domestic supply of semiconductors and also start a supply chain office in the Department of Commerce. That has to pass. Has to pass now. Not in six months from now, now. It&#8217;s bipartisan.</p>



<p>Mitch McConnell just threw a wrench in that about a week ago, saying that he wasn’t going to allow Republicans to move on that unless we move down reconciliation. That’s a perfect example, George, of increasing supply. We have inflation now because of lack of supply. And&nbsp;let&#8217;s increase supply.</p>



<p>STEPHANOPOULOS: But as you point out, Madam Secretary, Mitch McConnell said it&#8217;s not going anywhere as long as the President continues to push a budget reconciliation bill. So doesn&#8217;t that mean the CHIPS bill is dead?</p>



<p>RAIMONDO: It shouldn’t be dead. Why can’t we do both? What’s in that reconciliation bill? Allowing Medicare to negotiate for drug prices. What will that do? Bring down the prices of medicine for the average American consumer.</p>



<p>So the &#8212; again, the President wakes up every day pushing us and his team and Congress, what more can we do to bring down prices? So let&#8217;s bring down prescription drug prices, so that people feel that when they go to the drugstore and also let&#8217;s pass the CHIPS Act to bring down the prices of chips, which will bring down the price of pretty much everything you buy, because everything includes chips.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a false choice. He&#8217;s playing politics with our national security and it&#8217;s time for Congress to do its job on both of those dimensions.</p>

<p>Jill and I send our warmest greetings to Muslims across the United States and around the world celebrating Eid al-Adha. The Eid traditions and Hajj rituals that commemorate the devotion of Abraham and his son to God are an opportunity for Muslims to renew their faith, and a reminder of the common roots of the world’s great Abrahamic religions. And the act of sharing the sacrifice with those less fortunate in service of God mirrors our common commitment to work together to meet the challenges of our world today.<br><br>While COVID-19 restrictions remain, Muslims draped in white will be able to gather from around the world for the first time in two years to perform the Hajj. It’s a symbol of the progress we have made in fighting this pandemic and of all work we must still do to strengthen our recovery. Let us all take this opportunity to renew our shared commitment to work for peace, care for the vulnerable, and pursue greater equality and opportunity for all people.<br> <br>Here in the United States, Muslim Americans are leading on the frontlines, together with members of all faith communities, to assist those suffering from hunger and conflict, at home and abroad. To all those celebrating, Jill and I wish you and your loved ones a joyous holiday filled with community, celebration, compassion, and service. Eid Mubarak and Hajj Mabroor! </p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">George Bush Center for Intelligence<br>Langley, Virginia</p>



<p>3:57 P.M. EDT<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Thank you very much.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Thank you, thank you, thank you.&nbsp; It’s so good to be back.&nbsp; This is my third time standing before these stars to speak and &#8212; in my life in public &#8212; my time in public office.&nbsp; And &#8212; and it’s a great honor.<br><br>I was saying to some of the folks &#8212; and Avril has heard me say this before, along with Bill &#8212; that I’ve been involved with your agency for &#8212; not 75 years, but &#8212; (laughs) &#8212; but I hate to admit it, 52 years.&nbsp; (Makes the sign of the cross.)&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; I know it’s hard to say.<br><br>At any rate, but, you know, there was a time when there were questions raised about the agency in the so-called Church Committee way back in the early ‘70s.&nbsp; And that’s when they set up intelligence committees in the United States Senate &#8212; although I know you doubt that: intelligence in the Senate &#8212; but &#8212; (laughter) &#8212; I’m joking &#8212; and the House of Representatives.<br><br>And I was appointed to that committee by a great man &#8212; straight as an arrow &#8212; named Mike Mansfield, the senator from Montana.&nbsp; They called him “Iron Mike.”<br><br>And he &#8212; I think &#8212; I’m not positive, but I think the next-youngest person on the committee was, I think, 28 or 29 years older than I was.<br><br>So I’ve been doing &#8212; I’ve been watching from that day on and been deeply involved either as a member of the Intelligence Committee or the Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee or doing national security issues as Vice President and to today.&nbsp; And you’re an incredible group of people &#8212; incredible group of people.<br><br>Before I re- &#8212; move to my specific remarks I want to talk about today, I’d like to say just a very few words about the horrific, shocking killing of my friend, Japanese Prime Minister Abe.&nbsp;<br><br>I became acquainted with him when I was Vice President.&nbsp; I hosted him.&nbsp; He hosted me in Japan.&nbsp; And I just stopped by the Japanese Embassy to see the Ambassador and sign the <s>consolence</s> [condolence] book &#8212; the consol- &#8212; <s>consolence</s> [condolence] book for the Japanese people.&nbsp;<br><br>I knew him well.&nbsp; We worked together closely for years, and we spoke and consulted with one other when I served as Vice President.&nbsp;<br><br>And he &#8212; he was deeply committed to strengthening the alliance and friendship between the United States and Japan and pursuing an open and free Indo-Pacific region.&nbsp;<br><br>And service to his country and his people was in his bones.&nbsp; Even after he stepped down from public office, his focus on his health, he stayed engaged and he cared deeply.&nbsp; And I hold him in great respect.&nbsp;<br><br>This attack was &#8212; has had a profound impact on the psyche of the Japanese people.&nbsp; This is &#8212; this is a different &#8212; a different culture.&nbsp; They’re not used to &#8212; as, unfortunately, we are.&nbsp; Here in the United States, we know how deep the wounds of gun violence go for communities that are affected.&nbsp; And this assassination is a tragedy that all the people of Japan are feeling.&nbsp;<br><br>Today, I’m keeping his wife and family in my prayers.&nbsp; And the United States is standing in solidarity with our ally Japan with confidence in the strength of Japan’s democracy as they approach their elections on Sunday.&nbsp;<br><br>Director Burns, [Deputy] Director Cohen, I’m honored to be here, standing in front of this hallowed wall to honor 75 years of this proud institution and so many faithful public servants.&nbsp;<br><br>And Director Haines, thank you for being here today as well.&nbsp; For 75 years, our nation’s intelligence professionals have worked unceasingly and sacrificed willingly to make our country safer.&nbsp; And that’s not hyperbole.&nbsp; That’s a simple, straightforward fact.<br><br>And as we celebrate the history of this agency, we will never forget those who have laid down their lives in service to this nation.&nbsp; A hundred and thirty-nine stars behind me &#8212; two added just this year &#8212; each a patriot whose sacrifice we’re going to always honor and whose legacies live on in each of you as you continue their work.&nbsp;<br><br>You know, so often, you have to keep your identities secret, sometimes even in death, that we don’t get the chance to thank you enough for all that you do.&nbsp; You have to keep it secret, so many of you.&nbsp;<br><br>You ask for no recognition or personal acclaim, knowing that the quiet bravery of the women and men of this agency echoes loudly around the world &#8212; and I assure you it does, around the world &#8212; in lives saved, in crises averted, in truths revealed, in decisions of the 75 years of American presidents made better because of the insights you’ve provided.&nbsp; And again, that’s not exaggeration.<br><br>In the years between leaving office as Vice President and winning the nomination for President, the thing I missed most &#8212; and I mean this sincerely; I was a professor at the University of Pennsylvania &#8212; but I missed &#8212; you’re going to think I’m nuts, but I missed waking up every morning and getting &#8212; seeing the PDB.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;<br><br>No, seriously.&nbsp; Every single morning except from the time I was 26 years old &#8212; 27 years old &#8212; I mean 37 years old until I left the vice presidency &#8212; every morning, I got up and I knew what was happening around the world and in detail and, in many cases, in sharp relief.&nbsp;<br><br>It’s indispensable to me as I face some of the dec- &#8212; the difficult decisions to have the best possible information provided by the most capable, reliable intelligence community in the world.&nbsp; And again, not hyperbole, you are clearly the best in the whole world.&nbsp;<br><br>It was thanks to the incredible work of our intelligence professionals that we were able to forewarn the world what Vladimir Putin was planning in Ukraine.&nbsp; We saw what he was doing.&nbsp; You saw it &#8212; the forces he was amassing, the plans he was making.&nbsp;<br><br>Exposing Putin’s playbook punched a gigantic hole in the pretense and discredited his lies about what we were doing in Ukraine.<br><br>Without revealing sources and methods, that’s been critical to our ability to rally our Allies and partners around the world &#8212; again, not an exaggeration &#8212; to keep them united.<br><br>I imagine, General, you wondered whether we could.&nbsp; Many thought we &#8212; could we keep NATO alive?&nbsp; Could we keep it completely coherent and together?<br><br>And, by the way, I’ve spent well over 135 hours doing just that on almost a daily basis.&nbsp; Because Putin counted on &#8212; counted on the ability to break up NATO and to break our resolve.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>This organization changed dramatically since President Truman signed this into law &#8212; the National Security Act of 1947, which created the CIA.&nbsp; Wars have been fought, peace negotiated, new countries formed.&nbsp; Technology has empowered more people, but it also emboldened many to abuse that power that’s our wol- &#8212; our world smaller than it’s ever been.<br><br>And along the way, you’ve evolved to anticipate and respond to emerging threats from the earliest days of the Cold War to our fight against terrorism, to equipping ourselves for the competition ahead with China and meeting the transnational challenges that are reshaping the world, like emerging technologies, changing climate, and the spread of pandemics.&nbsp; You’re sort of the key to all of it.<br><br>Every step &#8212; every step, that 16-pointed compass star you walk across every morning when you come to work has guided your path.&nbsp; And a reminder of your ultimate mission: to bring together the intelligence and data from around the world so that those of us who direct American foreign policy can do everything in our power &#8212; everything in our power to keep the American people safe, because that’s what it’s all about.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>We turn to you with the big questions, the hardest questions.&nbsp; And we count on you to give your best, unvarnished assessment of where we are.&nbsp; And I emphasize “unvarnished.”&nbsp; That doesn’t mean I expect to always get it 100 percent right.&nbsp; But it does mean that I expect you to tell me the truth no matter what.&nbsp; No matter what.&nbsp;<br><br>I expect each of you to honor the democratic values and ideals that form the core of our nation’s strength.&nbsp;<br><br>We&#8217;re the most unique nation in the history of the world.&nbsp; That&#8217;s not hyperbole.&nbsp; We&#8217;re the only nation in the world based on an idea &#8212; not ethnicity, not geography, not religion.&nbsp; “We hold these truths to be self-evident…”&nbsp; We&#8217;ve never lived up to it, but we&#8217;ve never walked away from it.<br><br>And one of the ways to guarantee that doesn&#8217;t happen is the unvarnished truth.&nbsp;<br><br>Because, in this week when we celebrate our nation’s independence, we remember that America is strongest when we lead not just by the example of our power, but the power of our example.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why most nations follow us: the power of our example.&nbsp;<br><br>And, folks, although much of your work you do is going to remain unseen by necessity to protect you and your families and to safeguard the sources and methods, where possible we have to seek to balance secrecy with transparency, to shine a light on atrocities, and prevent plots or threats or acts of aggression before they happen.&nbsp; Because the greatest value of our intelligence collection is the good we do with it.<br><br>As we celebrate 75 years of this agency, I know you’re also honoring the trailblazers who helped make this institution what it is &#8212; the women and the men who changed the game or set the standard for intelligence profession.&nbsp;<br><br>You know, it’s an important reminder, just like these stars behind me &#8212; that’s what sets this agency apart &#8212; has always been &#8212; what sets you apart are the people.&nbsp; That’s what sets you apart.<br><br>And just like the work of every part of our government, our intelligence is more robust when we tap the full strength of our diversity as a nation.&nbsp;<br><br>When I first stood here, years ago, I looked out, there weren&#8217;t nearly as much diversity as there is today &#8212; women, people of color, men.&nbsp;<br><br>You know, that’s something “Wild Bill” Donovan knew when he created the Office of Strategic Services to collect intelligence to help us win World War Two.&nbsp;<br><br>And if diversity was essential to intelligence work in the ‘40s, its mission is critical today.&nbsp; If everyone brings the same ideas, the same experiences, the same skillsets to work, it will leave some pretty big blind spots in our security.<br><br>I also know that your work can be incredibly demanding.&nbsp; For the last 20 years, we’ve asked you to keep a relentless pace, serving in the face of physical dangers and daunting challenges.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>So let me just close by saying: Your health &#8212; your physical health and wellbeing are critically important to me and to your leadership here at the CIA.&nbsp; And as your President and your number-one consumer of your work, I have the greatest respect for you and for the sacrifices you and your families make for the country.&nbsp;&nbsp;Not just you.&nbsp;<br><br>There&#8217;s an expression &#8212; <s>Keats</s> [Milton] said, &#8220;They also serve who only stand and wait.&#8221;&nbsp; Think of your families, all the sacrifices they&#8217;ve made.&nbsp;<br><br>I know that you will continue to honor and uphold the highest traditions of the CIA and the highest values of this nation for the next 75 years and beyond.&nbsp; You will continue to serve as the bedrock of our national security as well as our national strength.&nbsp;<br><br>So, thank you for all that you do.&nbsp; May God protect you all and the work that keeps this nation safe from harm.&nbsp; And may God protect our troops.&nbsp; Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. (Applause.)<br><br>4:11 P.M. EDT</p>
