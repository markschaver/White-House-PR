<p class="has-text-align-center">Via Teleconference</p>



<p>5:05 P.M. PDT</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Thank you so much.&nbsp;&nbsp; And hi, everyone.&nbsp; I appreciate you all tuning in.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before we get started, I just wanted to set the ground rules and remind you all that this call is on background, embargoed until 5:00 a.m. Eastern.&nbsp; We hope to have a factsheet for you sometime tonight, if not the declaration language, to make sure that you guys have enough context.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And you may attribute the contents of the call to a “senior administration official.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>With that, I&#8217;ll kick it over to my colleague, [senior administration official].</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Great, thank you so much, [senior administration official].&nbsp; And thank you all for joining us this evening.&nbsp; We’re excited to be able to talk to you about the Los Angeles Declaration that the President will be presenting tomorrow with other heads of state.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So just to provide some background: The Western Hemisphere, as a region, is undergoing historic and unprecedented rates of irregular migration.&nbsp; Nearly every country has been impacted.&nbsp; And that is why President Biden is pursuing bold and concrete action to address hemispheric responsibility for the migration challenge the region is facing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tomorrow, President Biden, alongside fellow heads of state, will announce a regional partnership to address historic migration flows affecting every country in the region.</p>



<p>President Biden is asking all governments along the migratory route to establish and fortify asylum processing in each of their respective countries while more effectively enforcing their borders, conducting screenings, and removing those individuals who do not qualify for asylum.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Los Angeles Declaration on Migration and Protection is centered around responsibility sharing and economic support for countries that have been most impacted by refugee and migration flows.&nbsp; It sets forth a framework for a coordinated and predictable way for states to manage migration, and focuses on four main pillars: stability and assistance for communities, legal pathways, humane border management, and coordinated emergency response.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is a historic moment for our country.&nbsp; No prior administration has so assertively engaged to the region to secure concrete commitments to share responsibility and act to address this regional challenge.&nbsp; And no U.S. President has stood in solidarity with Canada, the countries of Latin America, and the Caribbean in this way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I&#8217;d like to take a moment to share a few of the bold new migration-related deliverables that will be shared tomorrow.</p>



<p>Under the declaration, governments will commit to collectively expand temporary worker programs to address labor shortages while reducing irregular migration.&nbsp; We see this as a true win-win for countries such as the United States, Canada, and Mexico, and other countries across the Western Hemisphere that are facing massive labor shortages.</p>



<p>It will also open, expand, and reinforce other legal channels for migration &#8212; including refugee resettlement, family unification &#8212; which will also help address critical labor shortages.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And we will surge support for countries that are hosting large refugee and migrant populations, and combat and root out human smuggling networks that prey on the most vulnerable in the region.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, President Biden will announce an ambitious package of new actions to combat irregular migration in a humane and sustainable way.&nbsp; For instance:</p>



<p>Jobs.&nbsp; We’ll strengthen the U.S. economy by addressing labor shortages, again, through the expansion of labor migration pathways, while strengthening protections for workers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Under stability and assistance, we’ll surge support to refugee- and migrant-hosting countries to stabilize populations and reduce secondary flows towards our southern border.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Refugees.&nbsp; We’ll demonstrate U.S. leadership in refugee response through our new and ambitious resettlement and funding commitments.</p>



<p>And law enforcement.&nbsp; Announcing a first-of-its-kind and unprecedented-in-scale campaign to disrupt and dismantle human smuggling networks across Latin America.</p>



<p>And last, support for Haiti.&nbsp; We will announce deliverables to help the people of Haiti, in light of the deteriorating security and humanitarian situation in the country.</p>



<p>The Los Angeles Declaration demonstrates the commitment of the entire region to step up collectively to address the challenges of historic levels of migration.&nbsp; Many countries across the region have already been absorbing millions of immigrants, migrants, and refugees, and it&#8217;s time that we work together to address this challenge.</p>



<p>Tomorrow&#8217;s announcement is a major step forward towards solving the unprecedented irregular migration challenge in the region and along our border while also focusing resources to modernize immigration and temporary worker programs to address labor shortages that are driving up prices.</p>



<p>I look forward to taking your questions.&nbsp; And back to you, [senior administration official].</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Thanks so much.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, [senior administration official].&nbsp; Thank you for doing this.&nbsp; I guess my main question is: How is the U.S. hoping to ensure that countries who take part in this declaration actually follow through on the commitments that you just outlined, especially the commitment around making sure that folks who don&#8217;t qualify for asylum are returned to their home country, especially folks who are able to come to the U.S. and who are not able to establish a legal basis to remain here?&nbsp;</p>



<p>How are you hoping to make sure those countries actually follow through on that commitment?&nbsp; Are you providing them anything in return?&nbsp; Or can you explain that for me, please?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Sure, thanks so much for the question.&nbsp; And this is, I think &#8212; you know, it&#8217;ll be an ongoing dialogue.&nbsp; I think that the process of developing the declaration really helps to bring us together to work &#8212; you know, there&#8217;s been a lot of work over the course of months, at all levels, to develop the text and to come up &#8212; you know, develop consensus around these ideas.</p>



<p>And so, but this is just the beginning.&nbsp; You will see, I think, tomorrow, not only the U.S. but many countries making concrete commitments around these four pillars that I mentioned, including the one that you just highlighted about strengthening asylum systems, cross-screening people that enter one border, repatriating people that don&#8217;t qualify.&nbsp; This is really critical.&nbsp; But actions are the most important thing.</p>



<p>So I think you will see the United States continue to engage actively with all of these countries.&nbsp; We will lead by example, but we will certainly expect that all countries do their part.&nbsp; This is &#8212; you know, at its heart, at its core &#8212; is about responsibility sharing.</p>



<p>And so, we will continue to provide support to countries that are really making a strong effort to build their asylum capacity.&nbsp; There&#8217;s many countries in the region that are doing that.&nbsp; And through the State Department, we provide a lot of support, and we will continue to do so.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, thank you so much.&nbsp; Can you provide more details about the support for Haiti that&#8217;s going to be announced tomorrow?&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Thanks for the question.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t want to get ahead of the President, but that’s just to say that I think we recognize that &#8212; you know, the need to expand legal pathways for &#8212; just in general, but also specifically countries where we&#8217;re seeing high outflows that are directly related to humanitarian situations and security situations.</p>



<p>And so, I think the goal here is to provide legal channels so that folks don&#8217;t have to take irregular means to get to safety or to reunite with family.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi.&nbsp; I wanted to ask about the pillar on expanding things like temporary worker programs and family reunification.&nbsp; I think, at least in the United States, that would require congressional action, and that&#8217;s something that the Biden administration already supports.&nbsp; So, what in the declaration is going to meaningfully change the situation for the United States, which as we know is taking in the vast majority of migrants in the Western Hemisphere?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; We would absolutely love to see Congress act on this.&nbsp; I think we see that there&#8217;s a real opportunity to expand legal channels for migration, and that &#8212; that would be good for our economy, good for the United States, but it would also directly have an impact on reducing irregular migration.</p>



<p>We will do everything we can within our executive authority.&nbsp; So, you know, I think you&#8217;ve already seen in the last year and a half the Biden administration do everything that we can to expand access to the H-2A and H-2B program.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve seen a huge uptick in the number of people that have been able to access that program and have come on temporary work visas from Central America by the &#8212; you know, we&#8217;ve done the supplemental for H-2Bs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have done a lot of work &#8212; USAID, in particular &#8212; on the ground to help build the capacity of the labor ministries in the three northern Central American countries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And then we&#8217;ve done a lot to, you know, make sure that employers are aware of how the program works and to better match workers in countries like Central America with, you know, employers that are that are seeking &#8212; that are facing labor shortages.</p>



<p>So, I think what you&#8217;ll see tomorrow are additional efforts to try to support employers in the U.S. to more easily bring in workers from the region.&nbsp; And, you know, other ways that that we&#8217;ve &#8212; coupled with worker protections &#8212; strengthening worker protections, as that&#8217;s been sort of a really important thing for us that we&#8217;re not only expanding access to work visas, but also addressing longstanding exploitation that exists in those programs.</p>



<p>So, again, we&#8217;re doing everything we can and it&#8217;s something that I think a lot of other countries are looking to do as well.</p>



<p>We will not be the only country tomorrow to announce ways in which we&#8217;re seeking to expand labor pathways.&nbsp; But you make a great point that without congressional action, there&#8217;s only so much we can do.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hello, thank you for doing this tonight.&nbsp; My question is: Does the administration trust the government of Ariel Henry to do what it should with the deliverables for Haiti?</p>



<p>And also, we&#8217;ve been getting questions from Haitian migrants about whether the administration would consider extending TPS for them.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; All I can say is that, you know, our deliverables tomorrow are focused on providing opportunities for the people of Haiti.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, [senior administration official].&nbsp; Thank you so much for doing this call.&nbsp; I am wondering if you can tell us: Is every country in the Western Hemisphere expected to sign?&nbsp; What about the countries that are not present?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; We don&#8217;t expect every country to sign.&nbsp; And we &#8212; as we were &#8212; as we were developing the declaration and engaging with countries in the hemisphere, we were prioritizing countries that are most impacted by migration and refugee flows.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, you know, as the President has pointed out, there&#8217;s countries in the region &#8212; we&#8217;re certainly not the only one.&nbsp; And there are some countries that have been particularly impacted by the Venezuelan outflows, the Nicaraguan outflows.&nbsp; A country, you know, like Costa Rica and Panama, you know, 9, 10 percent of their population are made up of immigrants and refugees.</p>



<p>So, you know, there&#8217;s certain countries that, I think, feel the pain and recognize the value in coming together, working on responsibility sharing, and advancing &#8212; exploring new tools that we can employ to better bring the situation under control.</p>



<p>So those &#8212; we’ve sought to build consensus among those states.&nbsp; And, of course, we opened it up to any other country that wanted to join us, but we were &#8212; we were never seeking to have all countries in the Western Hemi- &#8212; we didn&#8217;t expect to have all countries in the Western Hemisphere sign.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, I had a question about screening people for asylum.&nbsp; If I understand you correctly, you&#8217;re hoping that other countries screen people at their border.&nbsp; Is it sort of the hope that fewer people reach the United States border and apply for asylum once they get there?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; The goal really is &#8212; I keep on saying &#8212; it&#8217;s responsibility sharing.&nbsp; You know, we want &#8212; we don’t &#8212; we want all countries to enforce their own immigration laws.&nbsp; We want those that enter international borders to have the opportunity to be screened for asylum or other forms of protection or immigration relief.&nbsp; And we want those who’d be qualified to be returned to their home country.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s (inaudible) three, four, five borders to access (inaudible).&nbsp; And we really do expect all countries to (inaudible).</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi.&nbsp; So, how many countries do you expect to sign the declaration?&nbsp; And will we see concrete numbers assigned to each country whether it’s in (inaudible)?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; We’ll be able to provide you more details on all that tomorrow.&nbsp; I think you will be pleased to see a long list of deliverables from the countries that adopt the declaration.&nbsp; You know, this is really important to the President that this not be a statement of principles &#8212; that countries come forward with something to put on the table, just as we will be doing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so, you know, I think there’ll be a very ambitious and concrete slate of deliverables.&nbsp; And we look forward to sharing that with you very soon.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, thank you.&nbsp; I mean, I think I just want to second some of the questions have already been asked.&nbsp; If you all can provide any additional details on what these deliverables might look like, how many countries are signing on to the declaration, and even how many countries have agreed to provide these kinds of deliverables that we can include in our stories ahead of tomorrow&#8217;s announcement, that would be really helpful.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; One piece that I realize I haven’t spoken about that might be of interest to all of you is &#8212; and this connects to the economic agenda that the President laid out on the first day of the summit, on Wednesday &#8212; is we’re really looking at ways in which we can provide more support to middle-income countries in the Western Hemisphere that are hosting large refugee and migrant populations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think they see that this is a region that has a long tradition of solidarity, welcoming one&#8217;s neighbors, but, you know, the impact of COVID and now the Russian aggression in Ukraine &#8212; we&#8217;re seeing countries &#8212; it&#8217;s a lot harder for countries to be welcoming and to host.&nbsp; And so that&#8217;s why we have seen, I think, a real uptick in secondary movements.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, one thing that you will see tomorrow are &#8212; (audio drop) &#8212; are really strained under the weight of welcoming, you know &#8212;</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; [Senior administration official]?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of additional, you know, migrants and refugees.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, you know, work that we&#8217;ll do with the International &#8212; you know, the Inter-American Development Bank and World Bank, and other donors to provide more new sources of financing for these countries.&nbsp; And financing that will support not only the refugees and migrants, but the host communities themselves.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So that&#8217;s one more &#8212; one other area beyond what I briefed before where I think you&#8217;ll see that&#8217;s providing some specifics tomorrow.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi there.&nbsp; Just a follow-up to some of the questions that were already asked here.&nbsp; How much were the governments of Mexico and Guatemala involved in or consulted with in drafting the declaration?&nbsp; And does the administration still have faith that their commitment to this is solid, despite their absence at the summit?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Yeah, I can say that we have very strong bilateral cooperation with both Guatemala and Honduras on migration.&nbsp; And they&#8217;ve been &#8212; we&#8217;ve engaged with them quite a bit in the development of the declaration and have welcomed their support.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Thanks so much, [senior administration official].&nbsp; And thanks, everyone for joining, again.</p>



<p>And sorry, we are moving, so the call dropped a few minutes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just as a reminder, this call is under 5:00 a.m. embargo.&nbsp; And we hope to share a draft embargo factsheet shortly.</p>



<p>Talk soon.&nbsp; Bye.</p>

<p>President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. and President Jair Messias Bolsonaro met today to reaffirm the strategic importance of the relationship between the United States and Brazil—two of the world&#8217;s largest democracies. At a moment when the globe is facing a cascade of crises, from Russia’s war in Ukraine to global warming and pandemic recovery, the partnership between the United States and Brazil is vital to international efforts to address the climate crisis, and ensure peace. The Leaders pledged to continue their ongoing collaboration on trade and commercial matters, including through U.S. support for Brazil&#8217;s OECD candidacy. President Biden and President Bolsonaro also discussed how our countries must work together to facilitate sustainable development in the larger Amazon Basin to dramatically reduce deforestation, coordinate closely at the UN Security Council over Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine, and support democratic renewal.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Los Angeles Convention Center<br>Los Angeles, California</p>



<p>4:00 P.M. PDT</p>



<p>PRESIDENT BIDEN:&nbsp; Great to see you.&nbsp; And I want to say that I was fortunate enough to visit your magnificent country &#8211;(knocking at the door) &#8212; somebody is trying to get in &#8212; (laughter) &#8212; your magnificent country on three different occasions, including for the World Cup in 2014.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I also walked in the &#8212; in the festival in Rio.&nbsp; And I &#8212; Brazil is a wonderful place, magnificent people, and &#8212; because of the vibrant, inclusive democracy and your strong electoral institutions.</p>



<p>Our nations are linked by deeply rooted shared values that unlocks incredible opportunities for both our nations, in my view, so &#8212; driving an equitable, inclusive global economic recovery, and raising our climate ambitions, and a whole range of things.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And you have &#8212; you’ve made some real sacrifices as a country in the way you&#8217;ve tried to protect the Amazon, which is a great carbon sink in the world.&nbsp; And I think the rest of the world should be participating in helping you finance being able to preserve as much as you can.&nbsp; It seems like it&#8217;s an international responsibility because we all benefit from it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the principal driver of our relationship is a connection between our people.&nbsp; And I&#8217;m anxious to hear what&#8217;s on your mind and talk about what you &#8212; whatever you want to talk about.&nbsp; I’m &#8212; I&#8217;d like to listen as well as raise a few issues that are of, I think, mutual interest to us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, welcome, Mr. President.</p>



<p>PRESIDENT BOLSONARO:&nbsp; (As interpreted.)&nbsp; Mr. President &#8211;President Biden, it gives me great pleasure, once again, to visit your country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have a great deal in common, such as, for example, our shared love for freedom, democracy.&nbsp; We also share the same values.&nbsp; And we want, ultimately, the very wellbeing of our peoples and peace worldwide.</p>



<p>Brazil is a gigantic country whose territory is as vast as &#8212; can be one of the largest countries in the world.&nbsp; We also have many riches very much in the heart &#8212; heartland of Brazil.&nbsp; Our Amazon region, which is larger than Western Europe by comparison, endowed with incalculable riches, wealth, and biodiversity, as well as mineral wealth, drinking water resources, and also a source of oxygen.</p>



<p>At times, we feel threatened in our sovereignty in that region of the country, but the fact is that Brazil does very well preserve its territory.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And as much as two thirds of the Brazilian territory are fully preserved.&nbsp; More than 85 &#8212; that&#8217;s eight-five &#8212; percent of the Brazilian Amazonian region are preserved.&nbsp; Our environmental legislation is very strict, and we do all we possibly can to enforce it and comply with it to ensure the overall wellbeing of our nation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Currently, Brazil presents itself to the world as a very concrete reality in the eyes of the world at large.&nbsp; In the near future, we may become the world&#8217;s largest exporter of clean energy by means of green hydrogen exports.</p>



<p>We also have other matters or issues of interest on the agenda &#8212; such as, for example, the fact that Brazil currently feeds more than 1 billion people worldwide with our state-of-the-art agriculture and highly mechanized agricultural practices and using unmatched technology anywhere in the world.</p>



<p>The world today, I dare say, depends &#8212; and largely depends on Brazil for its very survival.</p>



<p>The environmental agenda: Yes, we do recognize our challenges, but we &#8212; yes, we do our utmost.&nbsp; We do all we can to, of course, meet our needs, to foster our interests, and why not also, of course, accommodate the will of the world at large?&nbsp; But as I said before, we stand as an example in the eyes of the world when it comes to the environmental agenda.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to food security and clean energy and also with regards to the environmental agenda &#8212; in addition to these topics, Brazil remains a huge country &#8212; a giant &#8212; and presents herself to the world as a solution for many of the current problems.</p>



<p>We are tremendously interested in drawing closer and closer ties with the United States.&nbsp; We have experienced almost 200 years of good partnership in our history.&nbsp; A few times, here and there, we may have distanced from each other due to perhaps ideological issues.&nbsp; But I am quite certain that with the advent of my administration, our both administrations have never had such a great opportunity, given the many affinities or shared areas of interest we have.</p>



<p>This year, we will be having elections in Brazil &#8212; in Brazil.&nbsp; And we do wish to have honest, clean, transparent, auditable, reliable elections so that there&#8217;ll be no shadow of a doubt whatsoever following the elections.&nbsp; And I&#8217;m quite certain that the elections will very much be carried out in this democratic spirit.</p>



<p>I came to office through democracy.&nbsp; And I am quite certain that when I leave office, it will also be through democratic means.</p>



<p>Brazil and the United States have all it takes to seal our trade relations, thus materializing a north-south axis of relations.&nbsp; Because other countries can work in a complementary fashion mutually, and we have the wherewithal &#8212; we have all it takes to become increasingly integrated nations and countries and serve as an example for the world.</p>



<p>Furthermore, Brazil, of course, still depends or relies on other countries in certain matters.&nbsp; We have always taken a balanced approach to these matters.&nbsp; We want peace in the world, and we will do everything for peace to be achieved.</p>



<p>We do regret the ongoing conflicts.&nbsp; But then again, I have a country to manage.&nbsp; I have a country to administer before me. And given our reliance on certain foreign players, we have to be cautious &#8212; always cautious, because the consequences following the pandemic and the mistaken policy, in my view, of “stay at home and we’ll take care of the economy later on,” further worsened by a war that currently takes place 10,000 kilometers away from Brazil &#8212; the economic consequences in effect are harmful and felt by all of us &#8212; and, in Brazil, especially harmful towards the more vulnerable segments of the population, who have to face inflation in foodstuffs as well as in energy prices.</p>



<p>So, Mr. President &#8212; President Biden, we remain fully available to cooperate towards building a way out of this episode that we, of course, never wish had happened between Ukraine and Russia.&nbsp; We intend and we support and we pray that we will find a way out from the current situation as soon as possible so that not only Brazil, but the world at large can go back to normalcy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That&#8217;s essentially what I had to convey to you by way of introduction, dear colleague and head of this nation, as we bear in mind the wellbeing of our peoples.</p>



<p>Thank you so much for the opportunity, Mr. President, for holding this bilateral session and meeting with you.</p>



<p>Thank you.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Los Angeles Convention Center<br>Los Angeles, California</p>



<p>2:37 P.M. PDT</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Good afternoon.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Please &#8212; please, sit down.&nbsp; Well, welcome again to the ninth Summit of the Americas.&nbsp; A lot of hard work has gone into this summit, and a lot of strong and constructive diplomacy so far, I believe.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We brought together diverse voices and stakeholders and <s>development</s> [developed] an ambition agenda and &#8212; agenda for action to address the issues that matter most to the future of our region.&nbsp; They’re not all the same concerns, in some &#8212; one sense.&nbsp; In another sense, they’re all incredibly intertwined.</p>



<p>I’m incredibly honored to be hosting all of you here in Los Angeles.</p>



<p>My administration and the proposals that we’re eager to discuss with you were &#8212; we wanted to begin to talk about today &#8212; proposals that I think are a far cry from what we saw from our previous American administration.&nbsp; But equally important, we &#8212; the Vice President and I &#8212; we want to listen, hear all of you &#8212; what you think we should we be doing.</p>



<p>The next few days, we have an opportunity to find ways we can do better for all of our people by working together.&nbsp; And I emphasize “together.”&nbsp; Together.&nbsp; That’s what our people expect of us.&nbsp; And it’s our duty to show them the power of democracies to deliver when democracies work together.</p>



<p>The United States stands ready to work in partnership with all of you &#8212; governments, institutions, civil societies, young leaders of tomorrow.&nbsp; And I invite my fellow heads of state and heads of government of the Americas to join me in adopting concrete hemispheric commitments that are going to advance our efforts to build a more sustainable, resilient, and equitable future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With our Action Plan on Health and Resilience, we’re going to help our region recover from COVID-19, while strengthening health systems, improving our ability to respond to future health emergencies by investing in health workers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new Americas Health Corps will train 500,000 public health and medical professionals in the region over the next five years.&nbsp; The United States is going to fund this together with the Pan American Health Organization so when the next pandemic hits, which it will, we’ll be ready and trained healthcare workers to administer the vaccines and the needed care, which we don’t have now.&nbsp; And it won’t cost your countries anything.</p>



<p>Through our efforts to strengthen the clean energy economy in the Americas, we’re committing to just &#8212; not just an energy transition but to make communities that have been historically marginalized are able to share equally in the gains, with equitable access to both good-paying jobs we’ll create and the affordable clean energy that will be made available.</p>



<p>I’m going to continue to work, just as I did when I was Vice President with Barack Obama, to promote trade and investment in clean energy, including using the United States International Development Finance Corporation, to help countries that need assistance to access financing and to help the region reach ambitious renewable energy goals by 2030.</p>



<p>By adopting the Inter-American Action Plan on Democratic Governance, we will &#8212; we’re going to commit our nations to making real the promise of the Inter-American Democratic Charter.&nbsp; And sometimes we forget what it says.&nbsp; It says: inclusive democratic governance, transparency and accountability, protections for human rights of all people, respect for the rule of law.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And on all these issues and more, the United States is making critical commitments to demonstrate our enduring investment in our shared future &#8212; and to address our shared concerns, because they are shared.</p>



<p>Last night, I announced the Americas Partnership [for] Economic Prosperity plan to drive equitable economic recovery and invest in working families throughout the hemisphere.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, I rolled out a new partnership and collaboration with the Caribbean countries to address climate change.&nbsp; I just spent a little time with the Caribbean leaders.&nbsp; We have to go back and do a lot more and hear directly about their concerns and discuss all the ways we can move together, as they pointed out to me just an hour ago, with a sense of urgency &#8212; not years, not months, but soon.&nbsp; Soon.</p>



<p>We’re making good on our commitment to vaccinate the Americas against COVID-19, building more than &#8212; going to be more than 65 million doses that we’ve already donated to the region.</p>



<p>Over the next few days, we’re also announcing more than $645 million in new lifesaving assistance to address food insecurity in the region and increase the ability to respond to disasters, as well as historic refugee and migration flows.</p>



<p>Each one of our countries has been impacted by unprecedented migration, and I believe it’s our shared responsibility to meet this challenge.&nbsp; And I emphasize “shared.”</p>



<p>Tomorrow, a number us will join &#8212; a number of us will join in announcing the Los Angeles Declaration on Migration and Protection.&nbsp; This will bring our nations together around a transformative new approach to invest in the region solutions that enhance stability, to increase opportunities for safe and orderly migration, to crack down on the criminals and human traffickers who prey on desperate people,&nbsp;and coordinate specific, concrete actions to secure our borders and resolve the shared challenges.</p>



<p>And tomorrow, I’ll be speaking more to this and laying out our commitments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The bottom line is this: The Western Hemisphere is home for all of us.&nbsp; Back in 2013, when I was Vice President to Barack Obama, he asked me to lead our engagement with the region.&nbsp; And I said we should be talking about the hemisphere and I made a speech back then, saying the hemisphere &#8212; we should look at it as a “middle-class, secure, democratic” hemisphere &#8212; from Chile &#8212; “from Canada to Chile and everywhere in between.”</p>



<p>Over the past decade, our region has changed.&nbsp; The challenges we faced have changed.&nbsp; And so, our policies and our solutions have to change as well.</p>



<p>But I want to be very clear: My fundamental view and my approach to the hemisphere has not changed.&nbsp; I still believe what I said then, and I hope that you do too.&nbsp; There is no reason why the Western Hemisphere can’t be the most forward-looking, most democratic, most prosperous, most peaceful, secure region in the world.&nbsp; We have unlimited potential.&nbsp; We have enormous resources and a democratic spirit that stands for freedom and opportunity for everybody.</p>



<p>And no matter what else is happening in the world, the Americas will always be a priority for the United States of America.</p>



<p>So, thank you again for being part of this summit.&nbsp; We have a busy few days and incredible opportunities ahead of us.&nbsp; So, let’s get to work.</p>



<p>And I’m now supposed to hush up and sit down, and we’re going to have a conversation.&nbsp; Is that right?</p>



<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Yes, Mr. President.&nbsp; (Laughter and applause.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>(The plenary session begins.)</p>



<p>(The plenary session concludes.)</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; I’ll be very brief.&nbsp; I want to thank you again for participating in the summit.</p>



<p>I think we’re off to a strong start.&nbsp; I heard a lot of important ideas raised.&nbsp; And notwithstanding some of the disagreements relating to participation, on the substantive matters what I heard was almost unity &#8212; uniformity: rational migration policy, doing something about the need to provide access to recovery and funding, a situation where we concluded that we must work on the environment and climate change, and so many other things.</p>



<p>And there’s no reason why the Western Hemisphere can’t be the most forward-looking, most democratic, most open and peaceful secure region in the world.</p>



<p>We can lead the world and &#8212; with the potential that exists in our people and our values.&nbsp; And so, the way we achieve that vision, I think, is by working together.&nbsp; And that’s what we’re doing these last couple of days.&nbsp; It’s going to take a challenge that’s &#8212; impacts on all of us &#8212; and to unlock the opportunities and the benefits that are available.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But notwithstanding the disagreements, think back to what we heard today.&nbsp; We heard almost total agreement on the substantive things that we should be doing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, let’s get down to real specifics in the next couple days as to what those substantive things are, how they’re implemented, who implements them, how we agree on them, what differences we have on them, so we get down to as &#8212; as the expression in English goes, “to brass tacks.”&nbsp; There’s probably a better Spanish or other phrase for it than mine.&nbsp; But get down to really what’s at stake so we can solve some serious problems.</p>



<p>Thank you all, and enjoy the rest of the day.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>

<p>A year of rising energy and fuel prices, disruptions from the global pandemic, climate change, and the impact of Putin’s unprovoked war in Ukraine, are challenging food prices across the world and in the Western Hemisphere. Many of our neighbors rely significantly on imports for food and are particularly vulnerable to rising food costs. The region is experiencing the highest spike in food prices in a generation.<br><br>At the Summit of the Americas in Los Angeles, the President is bringing together key partners to address this crisis and announcing $331 million for humanitarian assistance, food security assistance, and disaster risk reduction assistance&#8211; out of the $645 million total, that includes support for refugee and migrant populations.<br><br>The number of people facing severe food insecurity in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) doubled from 2014 to 2020 to more than 90 million people. Venezuela’s humanitarian, economic, and political crises have left approximately one-third of Venezuela’s population food-insecure and brought child malnutrition rates to emergency levels, with as many as 50% of children under five showing signs of malnutrition. In Honduras, the World Food Program reported that in late 2021, the number of people facing food insecurity had nearly doubled in just one year, due largely to the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of Hurricanes Eta and Iota. And, we must address food insecurity in the region in order to advance our cooperative efforts on migration and climate smart economic reform.<br><br>The United States is expanding investments in key social safety nets to help reduce poverty and food shocks in the region and to contributing more funding for humanitarian and food security needs that will improve the quality of life for peoples across the region. The United States is a leader in the global campaign to improve food security, from our work last month as chair of the Global Food Security Call to Action Ministerial meeting, to our pledges at the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/09/23/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-commit-to-end-hunger-and-malnutrition-and-build-sustainable-resilient-food-systems/">UN Food Systems Summit</a> and the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/12/07/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-plans-for-11-billion-to-end-malnutrition-at-global-nutrition-summit/">2021 Tokyo Nutrition for Growth Summit</a>, and our recent assumption of the co-chairmanship of the Global Agricultural and Food Security Program (GAFSP). We are working closely with the International Financial Institutions to accelerate the response to food insecurity in key areas including: (i) supporting vulnerable people; (ii) promoting open trade; (iii) mitigating fertilizer shortages; (iv) supporting food production now; and (v) investing in climate-resilient agriculture for the future. We also welcome the prompt implementation of commitments outlined in the International Financial Institution (IFI) Action Plan to Address Food Insecurity.  <br><br><strong>Joint Declaration of Agriculture Exporters</strong>: One-third of the world’s food is produced in the Americas, and the current global food crisis is an opportunity and responsibility for the region to step up to supply a greater share of the world’s commodities. The United States will commit during the Summit to work together to increase food production for export, increase fertilizer production and transportation, and to improve agriculture efficiency through technical solutions and information exchanges.<br><br><strong>Food Security and Humanitarian Assistance</strong>: The Administration is announcing approximately $331 million in assistance to support food security needs and to provide humanitarian assistance across the hemisphere.  This contribution will complement the United States’ existing commitment to providing life-saving humanitarian assistance, responding to acute food insecurity, and advancing capacity-building activities that bolster disaster preparedness and response across LAC, including by developing early warning systems and providing technical assistance to first responders and community-based risk management entities. Through USAID partners, the United States continues to prioritize food as well as water and sanitation, shelter, protection services and basic health care for vulnerable populations in Haiti.  In Central America, USAID is delivering emergency food, livelihood, and protection assistance, particularly in El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Los Angeles Convention Center<br>Los Angeles, California</p>



<p>1:45 P.M. PDT</p>



<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Welcome, Mr. President.&nbsp; We are in the midst of a discussion &#8212; a family conversation &#8212; with our colleagues, our friends who are members of CARICOM and, of course, the Dominican Republic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have been engaged in a very candid conversation about the challenges that this region &#8212; our neighbors in this region are experiencing &#8212; an urgent need for resources, for collaboration, for cooperation, and for consideration of the challenges they face &#8212; and a way that we will help.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And the range of topics has included the imminent, urgent matter of food insecurity.&nbsp; It has been about the development of climate finance and getting rid of some of the obstacles to access to finance for these nations &#8212; obstacles which I believe that some are unnecessary and can be eliminated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And &#8212; and also, we have talked about security issues.&nbsp; And in particular, one of the last points that was made about &#8212; was made about guns &#8212; and something that you are an extraordinary leader on, of course, in our country &#8212; and the need to take that seriously in terms of the trafficking of guns and what that has meant for these countries.</p>



<p>I have underscored in this meeting our commitment as an administration, your commitment as President to putting time and resources into strengthening this relationship, because we are neighbors and these countries are important to us for many reasons that include a shared history and shared values.</p>



<p>I present the President of the United States.</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; There you go.&nbsp; Anyway, thank you for letting me crash the meeting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Look, folks, I thought it was important that I come by, because I think when you have everyone from presidents to prime minister to foreign ministers here, this should be principal to principal.&nbsp; The Vice President has been kind enough to take on managing this part of the portfolio for me, just as I did for &#8212; when I was Vice President for my former president.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I &#8212; but it is &#8212; it is something that &#8212; and I&#8217;ve asked her to personally do this, but it is my responsibility.&nbsp; And I want you to know that on a leader-to-leader level, like we did whether it&#8217;s at dealing with climate in Europe or here, it’s &#8212; it should be person to person.&nbsp; And you should have access to me, and I hope I can have access to you as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You know, there&#8217;s a lot to talk about.&nbsp; And I don&#8217;t know if what you &#8212; were you talking about it all in front of the press here?</p>



<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; No &#8212;</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Because &#8212;</p>



<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; &#8212; we had &#8212; we had a bit of a conversation &#8212;</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; &#8212; I love the press &#8212;</p>



<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; &#8212; in front of the press, but it’s &#8212;</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; &#8212; but I’d like to get into &#8212; if you’re willing, for a few minutes &#8212; how &#8212; let you know my intention is to intensify the relationship with the Caribbean.&nbsp; And I mean that sincerely.&nbsp; You&#8217;re critically important to us in every way, and I hope we&#8217;re important to you.</p>



<p>And I think that there&#8217;s a means by which we can maybe undo some of the damage done the previous four years, when it wasn&#8217;t very much taken seriously &#8212; the relationships.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But, you know, I know most of you represent middle- and high-income countries, and it’s put you in a difficult position which cuts you off from any of the international financial tools that are out there.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think we&#8217;ve got some answers to be able to be significantly helpful in that regard I’d like to talk with you about in a few minutes.&nbsp; And &#8212; and I think that, you know, we can better prepare for natural disasters and rebuild after you get hit, increase resilience for future crises, including dealing with &#8212; there will be other pandemics that are coming down the line.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so, there&#8217;s a lot that I think that we can and should do.&nbsp; But I&#8217;m here not to tell you anything, but to hear what&#8217;s on your minds.&nbsp; This is a partnership.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not &#8212; I&#8217;m not &#8212; we&#8217;re not here to dictate.&nbsp; We&#8217;re here to &#8212; I&#8217;m here to learn, as well as to tell you what we&#8217;re prepared to do and what &#8212; you can ask me additional things you think we should or shouldn&#8217;t be doing.</p>



<p>And, for example, you know, we&#8217;re going to &#8212; I think we can work with you to strengthen the region’s ability to adapt to climate change; improve collaboration at the government-to-government level on great &#8212; you know, a lot greater private investment for &#8212; from around the world and from the United States and the hemisphere in &#8212; in the Caribbean; and our new U.S.-Caribbean Partnership to Address the Climate Crisis (inaudible) going to help enhance your climate resilience and your energy security; and to meet some sustainable development goals.</p>



<p>So, I think there’s an awful lot we can do.&nbsp; And I think as &#8212; as the gentlelady from Barbados will tell you &#8212; we discussed this at the climate conference there &#8212; you know, I think we have to understand that the major countries of the world, not just us, have an obligation to help the rest of the world &#8212; not just the Caribbean, but the African continent and other places &#8212; to deal with the consequences of the damage done by climate by the wealthy countries.&nbsp; Why we&#8217;ve &#8212; because we&#8217;ve developed &#8212; we&#8217;ve cleared our land,&nbsp;we planted, we &#8212; you know, we’ve done all this stuff.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And &#8212; and now to come along &#8212;&nbsp;and the infrastructure you need to deal with your &#8212; the consequences of climate are going to be incredibly expensive.&nbsp; And I think we have an obligation to step up and &#8212; and help meet those obligations, meet those infrastructure changes, and so much more.</p>



<p>So, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;d like to talk with you about, and I&#8217;d like to find out what&#8217;s on your mind.&nbsp; But thank you for being here.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I think, with your permission, I’d like to listen to what&#8217;s on your minds and &#8212; and maybe follow up on this as we can.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any concerns about the boycott?</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; No.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Los Angeles Convention Center<br>Los Angeles, California</p>



<p>12:08 P.M. PDT</p>



<p>PRESIDENT BIDEN:&nbsp; Mr. Prime Minister and to your delegation, we start by saying we have no better friend in the whole world than Canada.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s not hyperbole.&nbsp; That&#8217;s real.&nbsp; And you’re a good personal friend as well.</p>



<p>Before I begin, one of the things that’s going to occupy my country tonight, I suspect, is the first open hearings on January the 6th.&nbsp; And as I said when it was occurring and subsequent, I think it was a clear, flagrant violation of the Constitution.&nbsp; I think these guys and women broke the law, tried to turn around the result of an election.&nbsp; And there&#8217;s a lot of questions &#8212; who&#8217;s responsible, who&#8217;s involved.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m not going to make a judgment on that, but I just want to know that &#8212; want you to know that we&#8217;re going to probably be &#8212; a lot of Americans are going to be seeing for the first time some of the detail that occurred.</p>



<p>But you and I have a lot to talk about.&nbsp; We&#8217;re going to be hanging out with each other a fair amount at the G7, at the NATO conference in Spain.</p>



<p>But today we&#8217;re engaged in our hemisphere.&nbsp; And I think &#8212; it’s presumptive of me to say, but I think we both share the same sense that the possibilities for the hemisphere are unlimited.</p>



<p>We already have with &#8212; notwithstanding some difficulties in the hemisphere, we already have a circumstance where it&#8217;s the most democratic hemisphere in the world.&nbsp; And there&#8217;s no reason why, from Canada and along the Arctic, all the way down to the tip of Chile and Argentina, that we can&#8217;t &#8212; this can&#8217;t become a more &#8212; a democratic, a united, and middle-class, economically prosperous hemisphere.</p>



<p>And so that&#8217;s one of my objectives in this Summit of the Americas.&nbsp; There’s a lot we have to work through.&nbsp; But I want to thank you for your partnership.</p>



<p>PRIME MINISTER TRUDEAU:&nbsp; Thank you, Mr. President.&nbsp; That’s a place I want to start &#8212; just the friendship between Canada and the United States is deep.&nbsp; It was reminded to me as I was visiting NORAD a couple of days ago just how much we do together.&nbsp; We’re the only places &#8212; the only place in world where there is a truly binational command to protect our homelands.&nbsp; It is an example of that.</p>



<p>But as we gather here today, and the reflections that you’re bringing forward on democracy, it reminds us that it is extraordinarily important to be there for each other and to be there for our allies around the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And the work that we can do on supporting and projecting and sharing our values has a way of actually supporting and impacting citizens around the world to make the case that democracy is not just fairer but it’s also better for citizens, in terms of putting food on the table, putting futures in front of them.&nbsp; Those are the things we need to work on.</p>



<p>We have worked very closely over the past many months on the issue of Ukraine, where Canada is deeply engaged and supportive of everything we’re doing as a West on being there against Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine.&nbsp; And we will continue to work together on that.</p>



<p>We’re also dealing with real challenges around climate around the world and stepping up on that.&nbsp; And it’s always a pleasure to be doing that.&nbsp; But the center of it has to be, even as we gather with our friends across the Americas, how we create prosperity, how we counter the rising cost of living, how we create good jobs for our citizens not just in our respective countries but in each other’s countries and throughout the hemisphere.</p>



<p>And that’s why I’m so pleased to be here to work with you on.</p>



<p>(Speaks in French.)&nbsp; (No translation provided.)</p>



<p>PRESIDENT BIDEN:&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>Well, thank you all very much.&nbsp; Appreciate it.</p>

<p>12:40 P.M. PDT<br> <br>THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Good afternoon, everyone.  I &#8212; it is good to see all of you again.  We met virtually just a few weeks ago, and I&#8217;m looking forward to the conversation that we will have &#8212; a continuing conversation about the work we will do together, our partnership, and the commitments that we are prepared to make with each other around the issues that challenge us, but also the opportunities that are presented.<br> <br>As neighbors in the Western Hemisphere, the United States shares common bonds and interests with Caribbean nations.  As I said when we convened six weeks ago, our partnership is key to our shared prosperity and security.<br> <br>Today, our main focus will be the climate crisis, which, of course, is an existential crisis for our entire planet, and the Caribbean is on the front line of this crisis.<br> <br>In our last meeting, we discussed your priorities as it relates to this issue and many others.  And I indicated that the United States would look into these issues and work with you as we seek to resolve the challenges that each of our nations are presented with.  And I committed that we would develop a plan.<br> <br>Today, I&#8217;m pleased to announce the launch of the United States-Caribbean Partnership to Address the Climate Crisis, also known as PACC &#8212; P-A-C-C &#8212; 2030.  PACC 2030 is the United States government&#8217;s primary mechanism for addressing energy security and the climate crisis in this region.<br> <br>Through this partnership, we will support energy infrastructure and climate resilience projects at every stage of development, from beginning to end, in four particular ways.<br> <br>First, we will work with you to identify new clean energy projects.<br> <br>Second, we will provide technical assistance to make sure these projects are viable and appealing not only to you, but to investors.  We will bring them &#8212; investors &#8212; to the Caribbean on, essentially, roadshows to showcase the projects.<br> <br>And fourth and finally, we will improve access &#8212; and importantly &#8212; we will improve access to development financing, which will make these projects a reality.  We will engage with the private sector at every stage of this work because, of course, their involvement is essential to making this productive and meaningful.<br> <br>When we accelerate the transition to clean energy, I think we all believe that we unlock great economic opportunities for the entire region.<br> <br>When we work together to address this urgent threat, it benefits the people of the United States and the people of the Caribbean.  And all of us, of course, benefit by reducing emissions.<br> <br>In conclusion, strengthening the U.S.-Caribbean relationship is a priority for me.<br> <br>And regarding the climate crisis, it is one of our highest priorities.  But there are other issues that are also very important that we can and must address together.<br> <br>I want to thank all of the leaders for being here.  Again, welcome to Los Angeles, to California.  And I look forward to a meaningful conversation and a productive conversation &#8212; meaning that out of our conversations thus far, we have actually taken action.  And I look forward to continuing to do just that.<br> <br>And with that, I now invite Dr. Carla Barnett, the Secretary General of the Caribbean Community, also known as CARICOM, to share a few words.<br> <br>END                 12:44 P.M. PDT<br><br></p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Intercontinental Hotel<br>Los Angeles, California</p>



<p>11:13 A.M. PDT</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Thank you, Mr. Ambassador.&nbsp; Thank you all so much.&nbsp; Please, have a seat.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I’ve only been President about a year and a half, but every time I walk in a room and everybody stands up, I think there may be a fire or something.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Press, that was a joke.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; That was a joke.</p>



<p>Well, it’s wonderful to be with you this morning.&nbsp; I really mean it.&nbsp; I want to thank the Chamber of Commerce for bringing together this group of business leaders from all across the region.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And all of us here in Los Angeles for a simple reason: because we believe in the incredible economic potential of the Americas.&nbsp; I know I do.&nbsp; We all do.&nbsp; I mean, it’s &#8212; I &#8212; I just think the potential is unlimited.</p>



<p>The region is filled with dynamic energy: entrepreneurs who are ready to break out, innovators who will change the way we think and the way we do things, young people poised to seize the future.</p>



<p>Everybody &#8212; the press always asks me why am I so optimistic with the way things are.&nbsp; Take a look at all these young folks.&nbsp; They’re the best educated.&nbsp; They’re the most generous.&nbsp; They’re the people who have done the most, they’re ready to volunteer, and they’re the least prejudiced folks in the world.&nbsp; It’s a new generation.&nbsp; And underpinning &#8212; it gives me an enormous sense of &#8212; and I mean this sincerely &#8212; an enormous sense of optimism.</p>



<p>We have everything we need right here in the Western Hemisphere not only to point ourselves toward a future that is more prosperous, secure, and democratic, but the ability to achieve it as well.&nbsp; And for &#8212; all of you are essential to making sure we get to this place we have to get to.</p>



<p>You know, the private sector is able to move quickly to mobilize vast amounts of investment capital that’s going to be needed to unlock the enormous potential for growth in this hemisphere, in the region.</p>



<p>And when we combine the ability of government to direct economic activity toward specific challenges, to help mitigate risks, guard against unfair practices, and create a predictable demand with the agility of the private sector, I believe we can deliver real improvements for people’s lives.&nbsp; I really believe it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You know, just &#8212; well, I &#8212; my wife often reminds me that I had a doctor who &#8212; a long time ago &#8212; who was saying, when I had &#8212; I had an aneurism, he kept saying, “Is it congenital or is it environmental?”&nbsp; And I said, “I don’t care.&nbsp; I just &#8212; just get it done.”&nbsp; He said, “You know what your problem is, Senator?”&nbsp; I said, “No.”&nbsp; He said, “You’re a congenital optimist.”&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; But I am.&nbsp; I’m an American, and that’s why I’m a congenital optimist.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>So, look &#8212; I really mean it.&nbsp; We can do anything.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jobs that pay good wages and respect workers’ rights.</p>



<p>Communities that come to life around investments.&nbsp; Families that can envision a future with an opportunity to just &#8212; as my dad would say, “just give them a little bit of breathing room.”&nbsp; A little bit of breathing room.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When that happens, everyone prospers, including all of you.&nbsp; All of you.&nbsp; But to achieve this, we’ve got to update our recipe, in my view, for economic growth.&nbsp; It’s time to put a nail in the coffin, in my view, of trickle-down economics.&nbsp; It doesn’t work.&nbsp; It keeps you in an increasingly smaller and smaller world.&nbsp; It doesn’t work.&nbsp; It keeps yielding the same results: greater inequity, slower growth, less competition, and less innovation.</p>



<p>In the past few years, we exposed the weakness of prioritizing short-term profits and working exclusively to maximize efficiency.</p>



<p>We learned firsthand the pain that happens when just-in-time supply chains break down or hit a bottleneck.&nbsp; It’s a fundamental difference.&nbsp; And to all of &#8212; and you all felt it as well.</p>



<p>The COVID-19 pandemic triggered a global economic crisis that we’re still digging out of.</p>



<p>And now, Putin’s brutal, unprovoked war in Ukraine has created economic disruptions that are affecting the entire globe.&nbsp; And that’s not hyperbole.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And these won’t be the only shocks we’re going to have to navigate.&nbsp; Climate change is increasing the pace and intensity of natural disasters. I leave from here &#8212; on my way back east, I&#8217;m going to be stopping in New Mexico.&nbsp; They’ve had an incredible impact on their &#8212; on their environment of late.</p>



<p>Rising inequity and food insecurity around the world can fuel political instability.&nbsp; You all know that.</p>



<p>And the question is not “if” we face another pandemic; it’s “when” we face it and are we going to be prepared this time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, the economy of the future will increasingly belong to those who place a premium on resilience and reliability, who invest in innovation over long te- &#8212; over the long term and strengthen systems and supply chains now, and mitigate the impact of future shocks before they hit.</p>



<p>Each of us &#8212; each of us &#8212; the government and the private sector &#8212; have a critical role to play.&nbsp; That’s why I’m focused on driving economic policies that grow our economy from the bottom up and the middle out, because, quite frankly, when that works, everybody does well and the wealthy do very, very well.&nbsp; No one gets hurt.&nbsp; No one gets hurt.</p>



<p>For example, here in the United States, we’re making a generational investment on our infrastructure.&nbsp; It used to &#8212; we used to be number one in the world when I first came to the United States Congress.&nbsp; Now we’re number 13 in the world.&nbsp; Thirteen.</p>



<p>I don’t have to tell business people what that means in term of economic growth.&nbsp; But we’re fixing that.&nbsp; That’s going to be the benefit to the entire region.</p>



<p>We’re investing $1.2 trillion, bipartisanly, to upgrade our infrastructure &#8212; to fix crumbling roads and bridges and ports, airports all across the country.</p>



<p>And that’s going to help you get goods to market faster while creating good-paying union jobs &#8212; and I know a lot of you don’t like my saying “union” &#8212; but unions jobs to support working families, because that’s what&#8217;s happening.</p>



<p>Everyone benefits.&nbsp; Everybody wins when that occurs.</p>



<p>And the return on our investment is going to strengthen U.S. competitiveness throughout the 21st century.</p>



<p>You know, this is the same approach we’re taking across the Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity.</p>



<p>Many of the countries in our region qualify as middle-income countries, but that label doesn’t remove the persistent structural challenges that run &#8212; and deep inequity.&nbsp; “Middle-income” means you don’t get the benefit of a lot of opportunities.</p>



<p>So, we can change that and help governments make life better, easier, and fairer for their peoples by using hemispheric multinational financial institutions to modernize and mobilize greater levels of private investment and create good-paying jobs.</p>



<p>I know there are real barriers for you to contend with.&nbsp; That’s why we want to work with you to level the playing field.</p>



<p>As I said last night, the United States is prepared to put new capital in the Inter-American Development Bank’s private-sector lending arm &#8212; the IDB Invest &#8212; to help catalyze the flow of private capital into the region, especially to support startups, digital connec- &#8212; digital connectivity, and renewable energy, and health.</p>



<p>For example, we need to make it easier for countries in Latin America and the Caribbean to develop their 5G infrastructure without having to choose between investing in their digital future or renewable energy structure &#8212; to be able to do both.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We de- &#8212; we need to unlock the financing so that both can be done at the same time.&nbsp; We want to make sure our closest neighbors have a real choice between the debt-trap development that has become more common &#8212; more and more common in the region and the high-quality, transparent approach to infrastructure and investment that delivers lasting gains for workers and their families.</p>



<p>And by working through the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation to lower the risk around these kinds of investments, support policy reforms to improve investment in climate in countries &#8212; excuse me &#8212; the investment in climate &#8212; the climate investment in these countries, and level the playing field, we’re going to open up new areas of private-sector investors that are not only economically viable but are highly desirable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You know, over the course of this summit, the governments are coming together to make significant, concrete commitments across a range of issues vital to achieving sustainable and equitable growth throughout the region:</p>



<p>On bringing supply chains closer to home.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On fostering innovation and developing a shared framework for our digital future.</p>



<p>On kicking our action on climate change into high gear and speeding our clean energy transition.</p>



<p>On bolstering health systems and food security in the Western Hemisphere.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On managing safe and orderly migration as a shared responsibility through innovative and coordinated action to enforce our borders and stabilize migrant populations, while seizing the shared opportunity for economic growth.</p>



<p>My challenge to all of you is: If you step up and play a bigger role in driving inclusive, sustainable, equitable growth in the 21st century, a lot is going to happen.&nbsp; What more can you do to engage in these issues that shape our future?&nbsp; Not as a favor to me or to any government leader, but because it’s in your own overwhelming economic self-interest.</p>



<p>If you make the investments necessary to build more secure and resilient supply chains, that’s ultimately going to bring down your cost and make you more competitive and boost your bottom line.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You’re going to hear from John Kerry about the opportunities for private-sector innovation and new markets that will be critical to reach our climate goals.</p>



<p>Yesterday, Vice President Harris spoke about the $3.2 billion mobili- &#8212; mobilized by our Call to Action efforts in Central America, including &#8212; including from several companies in this room, to bring quality economic opportunity to the region.</p>



<p>We’re expanding the 100,000 Strong in the Americas program to focus on opportunities for young people in climate and STEM fields, especially in the Caribbean and Central America.</p>



<p>And I urge you &#8212; I urge you to join us with matching funds, just as you did when we launched the program 10 years ago.</p>



<p>There are many more examples, but let me close with this:&nbsp; We stand at an inflection point.&nbsp; I know you’re tired of hearing me say when I was running, and I continue to say it every day.&nbsp; We’re at an inflection point.&nbsp; More is going to change in the next 10 years than has changed in the last 30 years in the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Decisions we make today are going to have far-reaching impacts on our future.&nbsp; They’re going to last well into the middle of the century.&nbsp; And, business leaders, as &#8212; you all see where the trend lines are reporting &#8212; are pointing as clearly as I do.</p>



<p>And our challenge is to shape the outcomes so the future reflects the democratic values of our region, an economy that we want to live and work in and that ensures a fair playing field for our workers and our businesses.</p>



<p>As we navigate this inflection point, leaders and business and those who come out ahead are going to be the people who are going to lead this change for the future &#8212; not those stuck looking backwards and sitting on the sidelines.&nbsp;</p>



<p>None of us will be able to fully realize our ambition for the region on our own.</p>



<p>So let’s use this summit to tackle the obstacles to growth, come together around new ideas and new opportunities to take our region’s biggest challenges on and defeat them, and for all of us &#8212; all of us to prosper.</p>



<p>I really believe there is nothing we&#8217;re unable to do.&nbsp; And I think we&#8217;re prime &#8212; we’re primed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I&#8217;ll close with this that I&#8217;m going to say a little later at the general session: I think &#8212; I find no reason why the Western Hemisphere &#8212; the Western Hemisphere, over the next 10 years, is not developed into the most democratic hemisphere in the world, most democratic region in the entire world.&nbsp; We have everything.&nbsp; We have the people.&nbsp; We have the resources.&nbsp; And we have more democracies in this hemisphere than any other hemisphere.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So there&#8217;s a lot we can do, but a lot of it matters in the private enterprise side of the equation.&nbsp; You all &#8212; you all are on the <s>font</s> [front] of enormous ideas and opportunities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So I want to thank you all, and I look forward to working with you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And as &#8212; as my &#8212; every time I’d walk out of my Grandpop Finnegan’s house, he’d yell, “Joey, keep the faith.”&nbsp; And my grandmother would yell, “No, Joey, spread it.&nbsp; Spread the faith.”&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thank you.&nbsp; Appreciate it.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>

<p>President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. met today with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada in Los Angeles on the margins of the Ninth Summit of the Americas to review regional cooperation on economic development, the COVID-19 pandemic, migration, and food insecurity. The President and Prime Minister underscored their commitment to continue holding Russia accountable for its brutal actions in Ukraine, and reviewed their ongoing efforts to provide economic, development, and humanitarian aid to the millions of Ukrainians affected by the violence, as well as to provide security assistance to the government of Ukraine.  The President lauded Canada’s close partnership with the United States throughout this crisis and its leadership in enacting comprehensive sanctions and restrictions on Russia. The President also stated he looks forward to seeing the Prime Minister in Madrid for the NATO Summit.<br> <br>The Leaders also discussed the potential of developing critical minerals in both countries and joint efforts to make our supply chains and economies more resilient to external shocks, including through the work of <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/CANADA-U.S.-SUPPLY-CHAINS-PROGRESS-REPORT.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the U.S.-Canada Supply Chain Working Group</a>.  As major energy producers, both Canada and the United States play key roles in supporting security and resilience of supply chains, but Leaders also emphasized a shared commitment to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 to decrease our reliance on fossil fuels. The President thanked the Prime Minister for Canada’s support to bolster democracy in the Americas and throughout in the world, and for Canada’s support of the Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity and the Los Angeles Declaration on Migration and Protection. Both Leaders reaffirmed the strong bonds between our nations and their commitment to deepening the U.S.-Canada relationship across the breadth of our bilateral agenda.</p>
