<p>As we mark&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2022/04/29/a-proclamation-on-national-mental-health-awareness-month-2022/">Mental Health Awareness Month</a>, our country faces an unprecedented mental health crisis among people of all ages. Two in five American adults&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kff.org/report-section/the-implications-of-covid-19-for-mental-health-and-substance-use-issue-brief/">report</a>&nbsp;symptoms of anxiety and depression, and more than half of parents express&nbsp;<a>concern</a>&nbsp;over their children’s mental well-being. Over forty percent of teenagers&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/su/pdfs/su7103a1-a5-H.pdf">state</a>&nbsp;they struggle with persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness. These growing demands have exposed longstanding cracks in our care infrastructure while compounding many other domestic policy challenges, from criminal justice to homelessness to the labor shortage.&nbsp;<br><br>To address this crisis, as part of his Unity Agenda, President Biden has put forward a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/03/01/fact-sheet-president-biden-to-announce-strategy-to-address-our-national-mental-health-crisis-as-part-of-unity-agenda-in-his-first-state-of-the-union/">comprehensive national strategy</a>&nbsp;to tackle our mental health crisis, and used his State of the Union Address to call for a major transformation in how mental health is understood, accessed, treated, and integrated – in and out of health care settings. Across the federal government, the Administration has already invested nearly $4 billion in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/03/11/the-american-rescue-plan-people-difference/">American Rescue Plan</a>&nbsp;(ARP) funding to expand access to mental health and substance use services. The President’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/budget_fy2023.pdf">FY23 budget</a>&nbsp;goes further, by proposing over $27 billion in discretionary funding and another $100 billion in mandatory funding over 10 years to implement his national strategy and transform behavioral health services for all Americans.&nbsp;<br><br>This month, the Biden-Harris Administration is taking additional, new actions to advance the President’s mental health strategy across its three objectives: strengthening system capacity, connecting more Americans to care, and creating a continuum of support.<br><br><strong><u>Strengthen System Capacity</u></strong><br><br>At the center of our behavioral health crisis is a severe workforce shortage. We do not have enough providers, and they are not located in the right places or providing the right services to meet Americans’ needs. Even where there are sufficient providers, the fragmentation and inconsistency of the current system can make it difficult for people to find the right level of care. To address these needs, this month, the Administration is taking&nbsp;new&nbsp;actions to:<br><br><strong>Promote the mental well-being of our frontline health workforce.&nbsp;</strong>Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, health worker burnout had reached&nbsp;<a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/25521/taking-action-against-clinician-burnout-a-systems-approach-to-professional">“crisis”</a>&nbsp;levels – affecting up to 60 percent of frontline providers. To respond, the U.S. Surgeon General is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2022/05/23/new-surgeon-general-advisory-sounds-alarm-on-health-worker-burnout-and-resignation.html">issuing</a>&nbsp;the first-ever Advisory on Health Worker Burnout, which lays out whole-of-society recommendations to advance health worker well-being.<br><br><strong>Pilot new approaches to training behavioral health paraprofessionals.&nbsp;</strong>To better support veterans with substance use disorders, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is hiring 277 new Peer Specialists, employees in recovery themselves specifically trained and certified to help fellow veterans. The Department of Defense (DOD) is also hiring roughly 2,500 new personnel over the next 6 years to comprehensively address risk for conditions like mental illness and substance use.<br><br><strong>Strengthen our crisis care and suicide prevention infrastructure.&nbsp;</strong>The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) will expand access to mobile crisis services in high-need communities by launching a Mental Health Crisis Response Partnership Pilot Program. DOD will also strengthen suicide prevention services for service members, by establishing and training military health providers in new, standardized procedures to promote the identification, treatment, and tracking of patients at risk of suicide.<br><br><strong>Build the capacity of long-term care facilities to deliver behavioral health care.&nbsp;</strong>HHS is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2022/05/16/hhs-announces-new-funding-opportunity-strengthen-behavioral-health-services-nursing-homes-other-long-term-care-facilities.html">launching</a>&nbsp;a new, $15 million funding opportunity to establish a Center of Excellence for Building Capacity in Nursing Facilities to Care for Residents with Behavioral Health Conditions, which will work to strengthen behavioral health care in long-term care facilities by improving mental health literacy and combating stigmatization among staff.<br><br><strong>Address our caregiving crisis.&nbsp;</strong>In partnership with the&nbsp;<a href="https://acl.gov/programs/support-caregivers/raise-family-caregiving-advisory-council">RAISE Family Caregiving</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://acl.gov/programs/support-caregivers/supporting-grandparents-raising-grandchildren-0">Supporting Grandparents Raising Grandchildren</a>&nbsp;Advisory Councils, HHS’s Administration for Community Living will submit a National Caregiving Strategy to Congress outlining new recommendations for better supporting family caregivers, many of whom have been under great strain during the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp;<br><br>This builds on prior Administration actions, including:</p>



<ul><li>HHS invested nearly $400 million to help states prepare for the July launch of 988, the new three-digit code for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. And the Center for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS)&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/biden-harris-administration-awards-15-million-20-states-mobile-crisis-intervention">established</a>&nbsp;a new state option for Medicaid coverage of qualifying community-based mobile crisis intervention services.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>HHS awarded&nbsp;<a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/newsroom/press-announcements/202107291030">$250 million</a>&nbsp;across 100 grants to increase access to Certified Community Behavioral Health Centers (CCBHCs), which provide 24/7, comprehensive primary and behavioral health care – including crisis care – to the most vulnerable Americans.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Bright Futures, a HRSA partnership with the American Academy of Pediatrics,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/01/12/2022-00461/updates-to-the-bright-futures-periodicity-schedule">added</a>&nbsp;universal screening for suicide risk to its national guidelines for individuals ages 12 to 21.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>AmeriCorps invested $8 million through its new&nbsp;<a href="https://americorps.gov/about/what-we-do/public-health-americorps">Public Health AmeriCorps</a>&nbsp;to fund the recruitment of new AmeriCorps members to support individuals with mental health and substance use challenges.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>HHS invested&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2021/11/22/hhs-announces-record-health-care-workforce-awards-in-rural-underserved-communities.html">$1 billion</a>&nbsp;in the National Health Service Corps, Nurse Corps, and Substance Use Disorder Treatment and Recovery Loan Repayment Program, which has enabled these provider pipeline programs to amass the largest field strength in history.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>HHS awarded&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2022/01/20/biden-harris-administration-awards-103-million-american-rescue-plan-funds-reduce-burnout-promote-mental-health-wellness-among-health-care-workforce.html">$103 million</a>&nbsp;to 45 health care organizations to address burnout and strengthen resiliency among health care workers.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>The President signed the bipartisan Dr. Lorna Breen Health Care Provider Protection Act into law, which&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aha.org/news/news/2022-03-18-dr-lorna-breen-health-care-provider-protection-act-signed-law">authorized</a>&nbsp;$135 million over three years to train health care providers on suicide prevention and behavioral health.</li></ul>



<p><strong><u>Connect Americans to Care</u></strong><br><br>Even when services are available, barriers like cost, cultural bias, and inconvenience prevent people from consistently accessing the care they need. On average, it takes&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nami.org/mhstats">11 years</a>&nbsp;after the onset of mental health symptoms for someone to seek treatment. It is critical that we make care affordable across all types of health insurance coverage, and integrate mental health services in ways that reduce stigmatization and access barriers. This month, the Biden-Harris Administration is taking&nbsp;new&nbsp;actions to:<br><br><strong>Advance behavioral health care for the Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander (AANHPI) community.&nbsp;</strong>To reduce behavioral health-related disparities, HHS is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2022/05/17/hhs-announces-funding-opportunity-for-new-asian-american-native-hawaiian-pacific-islander-behavioral-health-center-of-excellence.html">announcing</a>&nbsp;a nearly $3.5 million, five-year grant opportunity to launch a new AANHPI Center of Excellence, which will promote culturally and linguistically appropriate behavioral health practices while providing training and technical assistance on addressing the mental health impacts of hate and unconscious bias against the AANHPI community.<br><br><strong>Lower barriers to behavioral health care among service members.&nbsp;</strong>To reduce concerns about potential negative impacts on military career progression, DOD is revising its policy that outlines requirements for notifying military commanders when service members seek mental health or substance use care.<br><br><strong>Ensure access to mental health support in schools, colleges and universities.</strong>&nbsp;The Department of Education is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/building-president-bidens-unity-agenda-education-department-urges-colleges-use-american-rescue-plan-funds-provide-mental-health-supports-students">issuing</a>&nbsp;new guidance to colleges and universities on how to use ARP relief funds to provide mental health and substance use disorder services on campus, including by hiring mental health professionals, expanding virtual counseling support, offering stress-reduction activities, building peer support programs, and erecting student-staffed crisis hotlines.<br><br><strong>Strengthen the federal government’s role as a model employer for behavioral health.&nbsp;</strong>In addition to facilitating access to comprehensive telebehavioral health benefits through the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is working to reinvigorate Employee Assistance Programs provided by all federal agencies to better meet employees’ behavioral health needs, while disseminating best practices and new ideas for improving federal workplace mental health.<br><br>This builds on prior Administration actions, including:</p>



<ul><li>In January, federal agencies&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/EBSA/laws-and-regulations/laws/mental-health-parity/report-to-congress-2022-realizing-parity-reducing-stigma-and-raising-awareness.pdf">issued</a>&nbsp;a detailed report about how to improve insurance company compliance with requirements related to mental health services. HHS also developed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/newsroom/press-announcements/20220427/hhs-new-mental-health-substance-use-disorder-benefit-resources">new resources</a>&nbsp;to help patients and state regulators better understand how to enforce their rights.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>ARP provided&nbsp;<a href="https://oese.ed.gov/offices/american-rescue-plan/american-rescue-plan-elementary-and-secondary-school-emergency-relief/">$122 billion</a>&nbsp;in relief funds for schools to help them reopen safely and address the social and emotional needs of students. As of April, the number of social workers in public schools has increased by 67 percent, and the number of counselors has increased by 18 percent, since the years before the pandemic.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>In March, HHS and the Department of Education&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2022/03/24/hhs-secretary-xavier-becerra-education-secretary-miguel-a-cardona-announce-joint-effort-develop-share-resources-ensure-children-have-access-school-based-health-services.html">announced</a>&nbsp;a joint effort to develop and share&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/school-based-health-services-resources.pdf">resources</a>&nbsp;to ensure that children have access to school-based health services.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>HHS invested $80 million in ARP funding into the Pediatric Mental Health Care Access program, which promotes integrating care for behavioral health needs into pediatric primary care settings.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>The final&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/calendar-year-cy-2022-medicare-physician-fee-schedule-final-rule">CY 2022 Medicare Physician Fee Schedule rule</a>&nbsp;increased access to telebehavioral health services, including by allowing certain services to occur via audio-only calls when video is unavailable, and by allowing Rural Health Clinics and Federally Qualified Health Centers to report and receive payment for telebehavioral health services.</li></ul>



<p><strong><u>Support Americans by Creating Healthy Environments</u></strong></p>



<p>No health problem can be addressed solely through the health care system. We must also invest in programs that can prevent mental health challenges and build environments that promote wellness and recovery. Decades of research show that coordinated prevention across settings can pay long-term dividends, including reductions in community violence. Similarly, when settings provide services and restorative programs that support individuals with mental health problems or other at-risk behaviors, they can promote broader social and economic gains. This month, the Biden-Harris Administration is taking&nbsp;new&nbsp;actions to:<br><br><strong>Train social and human services professionals in basic mental health skills.</strong>&nbsp;The Department of Agriculture (USDA) is launching a series of initiatives to improve mental health literacy among its partners and employees. It will give all public-facing employees who work with agricultural producers and grant recipients access to Mental Health First Aid Training and integrate more robust mental health messaging into its programs. And, it will support efforts to train 4-H volunteers and participants in social and emotional skills, help-seeking, and self-care.<br><br><strong>Train tribal law enforcement personnel in mental health.&nbsp;</strong>The Department of Interior’s Bureau of Indian Affairs Office of Justice Services is implementing a Mental Health Crisis Instructor Training Program and a Resiliency Initiative to train officers on coping with stress; managing anxiety; providing psychological first aid; and identifying substance use disorder, depression, and post-traumatic stress in themselves and in colleagues.<br><br><strong>Enhance school-based supports in Native communities.&nbsp;</strong>The Department of Interior’s Bureau of Indian Education is launching a Social and Emotional Learning Initiative for educators and staff, which will work to improve access to culturally relevant social and emotional learning supports at schools serving Native communities. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Spur innovation in recovery support models.</strong>&nbsp;HHS is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2022/05/18/hhs-announces-its-first-ever-behavioral-health-recovery-innovation-challenge.html">launching</a>&nbsp;its first-ever behavioral health Recovery Innovation Challenge, which will disburse up to 10 awards totaling $400,000 to peer-run and community-based groups implementing innovative programs that advance recovery from substance use disorders. &nbsp;<br><br><strong>Improve financial security among veterans.&nbsp;</strong>VA is launching a National Center for Veterans Financial Empowerment to provide veterans with education, tools, and resources to successfully navigate financial strain, which has been associated with increased risk of suicide.<br><br><strong>Enforce workplace rights of the mentally ill.</strong>&nbsp;The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) is increasing outreach to mental health providers to support protections under the Americans with Disabilities Act. It is also committing to increase the accessibility of its technical assistance and guidance documents on mental health.</p>



<p><strong>Establish a federal research action plan on mental health.&nbsp;</strong>The underlying causes of most mental health conditions remain largely unknown.&nbsp;To fill this knowledge gap, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/">White House Office of Science &amp; Technology Policy</a>&nbsp;is leading an effort to establish several new cross-agency research priorities for mental health as part of a broader coordinating effort on brain health. &nbsp;<br>This builds on prior Administration actions, including:</p>



<ul><li>HHS opened the first-ever&nbsp;<a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/about-us/who-we-are/offices-centers/or">Office of Recovery</a>&nbsp;at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, dedicated to evaluating and initiating programs, policies, and services that center the needs and experiences of those in recovery.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>HHS’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced new&nbsp;<strong>Comprehensive Suicide Prevention Program</strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=337047">funding</a>&nbsp;to support a comprehensive public health approach to suicide prevention with attention to disproportionately affected populations, such as veterans, rural communities, tribal, LGBTQ, and youth.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>EEOC has actively used its enforcement authority to combat unlawful disability discrimination against individuals based on their&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/newsroom/ranews-management-company-pay-250000-settle-disability-discrimination-lawsuit">mental health conditions</a>, their use of legally prescribed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/newsroom/lonza-america-pay-150000-settle-eeoc-disability-lawsuit">opioid medications</a>, and their participation in substance use recovery programs. It has also&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/wysk/what-you-should-know-about-covid-19-and-ada-rehabilitation-act-and-other-eeo-laws">conducted</a>&nbsp;outreach and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/depression-ptsd-other-mental-health-conditions-workplace-your-legal-rights">education</a>&nbsp;programs for&nbsp;<a href="https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/USEEOC/bulletins/2cc9aa1">employers</a>&nbsp;emphasizing their obligations to treat employees with mental health conditions the same as those with any other disabilities.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>USDA invested nearly&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%2425+million+in+the+form+of+50+grants+to+the+Farm+and+Ranch+Stress+Assistance+Network+projects">$25 million</a>&nbsp;in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nifa.usda.gov/grants/programs/farm-ranch-stress-assistance-network-frsan">Farm and Ranch Stress Assistance Network</a>&nbsp;projects which to strengthen programs that provide professional behavioral health counseling and other services to individuals in agricultural occupations.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>The Department of Education released&nbsp;<a href="https://www2.ed.gov/documents/students/supporting-child-student-social-emotional-behavioral-mental-health.pdf">Supporting Child and Student Social, Emotional, Behavioral and Mental Health</a>&nbsp;to enhance the promotion of mental health and the social and emotional well-being among children and students.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>CDC invested $15 million in the Healthy Schools program, which&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/resources/publications/factsheets/healthy-schools.htm">works</a>&nbsp;with states, school systems, and national partners to improve the well-being of K-12 students.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>The Surgeon General issued a new&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/surgeon-general-youth-mental-health-advisory.pdf">Advisory</a>&nbsp;to highlight the urgent need to address the nation’s youth mental health crisis – with particular attention to online harms and the impact of social media on young people’s mental health. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li><li>HHS&nbsp;<a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/grants/grant-announcements/sm-22-013">announced</a>&nbsp;$2 million in funding to establish the new Center of Excellence on Social Media and Mental Wellness, which will develop and disseminate information, guidance, and training on the impact of children and youth social media use, especially the potential risks social media platforms pose to mental health.</li></ul>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Arlington National Cemetery<br>Arlington, Virginia</p>



<p>12:54 P.M. EDT</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They lie here in glory and honor &#8212; in quiet rows in Arlington, in cemeteries in Europe that I visited and many of you have, in graves across our country, in towns large and small &#8212; America’s beloved daughters and sons who dared all, risked all, and gave all to preserve and defend an idea unlike any other in human history: the idea of the United States of America.</p>



<p>And today, as a nation, we undertake a sacred ritual: to reflect and to remember.&nbsp; Because if we forget the lives that each of those silent markers represent &#8212; mothers, fathers, siblings, spouses, children &#8212; if we forget what they sacrificed, what they made so that our nation might endure strong, free, and united, then we forget who we are &#8212; who we are.</p>



<p>Ladies and gentlemen, our First Lady and the love of my life, Jill; Vice President Harris and the Second Gentleman; Secretary Austin; General Milley; the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Cabinet members; Gold Star families, most importantly; and survivors: Today we renew our sacred vow &#8212; it’s a simple vow: to remember.&nbsp; To remember.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Memorial Day is always a day where pain and pride are mixed together.&nbsp; We all know it, sitting here.&nbsp; Jill and I know it.&nbsp; Today is the day our son died.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, folks, for those who have lost a loved one in the service of our country, if your loved one is missing or unaccounted for, I know the ceremonies reopen that black hole in the center of your chest that just pulls you in, suffocates you.</p>



<p>As I said, seven years ago today, our son, Major Beau Biden, took his last breath at Walter Reed.&nbsp; A major in the Delaware Army National Guard, he insisted on deploying to Iraq</p>



<p>with his unit for a year when he was attorney general.&nbsp; He came home a decorated soldier, a Bronze Star, Legion of Merit, and Delaware’s Conspicuous Service Cross.</p>



<p>He didn’t die in the line of duty.&nbsp; He came home from Iraq with cancer.&nbsp; It was a horrific cancer that stole us from him, stole &#8212; and him from us.</p>



<p>But still, it always feels to me on Memorial Day &#8212; I see him, not as he was the last time I held his hand, but the day I pinned his bars on him as a second lieutenant.</p>



<p>I see him with me down at the Delaware Memorial Bridge hugging all the Gold Star families.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Days like this bring back, before your eyes, their smile and their laugh.&nbsp; And the last conversation you had, each of you know it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The hurt can be overwhelming.  But for so many of you, as is with Jill and me, the hurt is wrapped around the knowledge that your loved one was part of something bigger &#8212; bigger than any of us.</p>



<p>They chose a life of purpose.&nbsp; It sounds corny, like a Memorial Day speech, but I mean it from the bottom of my heart.&nbsp; They chose a life of purpose.</p>



<p>They had a mission.&nbsp; And above all, they believed in duty; they believed in honor; they believed in their country.</p>



<p>And still today, we are free because they were brave.&nbsp; We live by the light of the flame of liberty that they kept burning.&nbsp; And so a part of them is still with us no matter how long ago we lost them.</p>



<p>And as hard as it is for many to believe, especially those whose loss is still raw, I promise you the day will come when the memory of your loved one, your patriot, will bring a smile to your lip before it brings a tear to your eye.&nbsp; That’s when you know you’re going to make it.</p>



<p>Today, America’s ser- &#8212; American service members stand watch around the world, and, as many of you know, often at great personal risk.</p>



<p>And this Memorial Day, we know the memory is still painful of all the fallen who lost their lives during the last two decades in combat.  Each of them leaving behind a family, a community.  Hearts broken by their absence, and lives that will never be the same.</p>



<p>We see in the hundreds of graves here in Section 60, at Arlington, a reminder that there’s nothing low-risk or low-cost about war for the women and men who fight it.</p>



<p>7,054 American military members gave their lives over 20 years of our Iraq and Afghan conflicts.&nbsp; Untold others died of injuries and illness connected to their service and these wars.</p>



<p>And the enduring grief borne by the survivors is a cost of war that we’ll carry as a nation forever.</p>



<p>And so, to every Gold Star family, to every survivor and family member and caregiver: This grateful nation owes you as well as that person you lost.</p>



<p>And we can never repay the sacrifice, but we will never stop trying.&nbsp; We’ll never fail in our duty to remember: With their lives, they bought our freedom.</p>



<p>And so, with our lives, we must always live up to their example &#8212; putting service before self; caring for our neighbors as ourselves; working fervently to bring our union just that much closer to fulfilling the founding creed, as the Secretary said, that all men and women are created equal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I’ve often said that, as a nation, we have many obligations.&nbsp; But the only one that is truly sacred &#8212; the only truly sacred obligation we have &#8212; is to prepare and equip those women and men we send into harm’s way, and care for them and their families when they return home and when they don’t.</p>



<p>This is an obligation that unites Americans and brings us together &#8212; to make sure the women and men who are willing to lay down their lives for us get the very best from us in return.</p>



<p>I want to acknowledge that we’re making progress in key areas like the comprehensive, bipartisan legislation that is advancing in Congress that will deliver healthcare services and benefits to veterans and their survivors impacted by toxic exposures.</p>



<p>We don’t know how many Americans and service members may have died because of what they were exposed to on the battlefield.&nbsp; The toxic smoke from burn pits near where they were based &#8212; burn pits that incinerated the wastes of war, medical and hazardous material, jet fuel, and so much more.</p>



<p>But we have a duty to do right by them.&nbsp; And I am determined to make sure that our brave service families and members that served alongside them do not wait decades for the care and benefits that they deserve.&nbsp; And that’s why &#8212; that’s why we’re working so hard to find out what the facts are.&nbsp; Where we can still save lives, we have to act.</p>



<p>All of us also have a duty to renew our commitment to the foundational values of our nation, in their honor &#8212; for those are the values that have inspired generation after generation to service.</p>



<p>On Friday, I spoke at the graduation and commissioning of &#8212; ceremony of the U.S. Naval Academy.&nbsp; I had an opportunity to do that before as well.&nbsp; It was a remarkable experience again, an honor, looking out at those young men and women &#8212; newly commissioned officers &#8212; embarking on a life of service.</p>



<p>They hold before them the example of the heroes who have gone before them &#8212; many of you are family members &#8212; heroes who have answered duty’s call at Lexington and Concord, Antietam and Gettysburg, Belleau Woods and thee Battle of the Bulge, in Korea and Vietnam and Afghanistan, Iraq, and so many other places around the world &#8212; so many of whom never returned home, including the legacy of all those held prisoners of war or who are still missing in action.</p>



<p>To be here today, soon after that joyful celebration at the Academy, is a bracing reminder of all that we ask of our service members and their families &#8212; for it’s on the strong shoulders and noble spirits of our service members that our freedom is built, our democracy sustained.</p>



<p>And in this moment, when a war of aggression is once more being waged by Russia to snuff out the freedom, the democracy, the very culture and identity of neighboring Ukraine, we so &#8212; we see so clearly all that’s at stake.</p>



<p>Freedom has never been free.&nbsp; Democracy has always required champions.</p>



<p>And, today, in the perennial struggle for democracy and freedom, Ukraine and its people are on the frontlines fighting to save their nation.</p>



<p>But their fight is part of a larger fight that unites all people.&nbsp; It is a fight that so many of the patriots, whose eternal rest is here in these hallowed grounds, were part of.</p>



<p>A battle between democracy and autocracy, between liberty and repression, between appetites and ambition of a few who forever seek to dominate the lives and liberties of many.</p>



<p>A battle for essential democratic principles &#8212; the rule of law, free and fair elections, freedom to speak and write and to assemble, freedom to worship as one chooses, freedom of the press &#8212; principles that are essential for a free society.</p>



<p>You’ve heard this a lot.&nbsp; You’ve heard this a lot over the years, but we’re now realizing how real it is around the world in so many countries as I speak.&nbsp; These are the foundations of our great experiment, but they are never guaranteed, even here in America.</p>



<p>Every generation has to defeat democracy’s mortal foes.&nbsp; And into every generation, heroes are born, willing to shed their blood for that which they and we hold dear.</p>



<p>Ladies and gentlemen, today we remember and we reaffirm: Freedom is worth the sacrifice.&nbsp; Democracy is not perfect; it’s never been good &#8212; perfect.&nbsp; But it’s worth fighting for; if necessary, worth dying for.</p>



<p>It’s more than just our form of government, it is part of the very soul of America.&nbsp; The soul of America.</p>



<p>Our democracy is our greatest gift as a nation, made holy by those we’ve lost along the way.&nbsp; Our democracy is how we undertake the constant work of perfecting the union &#8212; and we have not perfected it, but we’ve never stopped trying; of opening the doors wider of opportunity and prosperity and justice for people everywhere.</p>



<p>Our democracy is how we endure through every challenge, overcome every obstacle we faced through the last 246 years of self-government, and how we’ve come back stronger than before.</p>



<p>We must never walk away from that.&nbsp; We must never betray the lives laid down to make our nation a beacon to the world &#8212; a  citadel of liberty and justice for everybody.</p>



<p>This is the mission of our time.&nbsp; Our memorial to them must not be just a day when we pause and pray, it must be a daily commitment to act, to come together, to be worthy of the price that was paid.</p>



<p>May God bring comfort to all those who mourn.&nbsp; May God bless our Gold Star families and survivors.&nbsp; And please, God, protect our troops.&nbsp;</p>



<p>God bless America and all of you.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">South Lawn</p>



<p>9:15 A.M. EDT</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Good morning, Mr. President.&nbsp; Do you feel more motivated to get action on guns now?</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Well, I’ve been pretty motivated all along.&nbsp; You know, the folks &#8212; the folks who were victimized there, and their families, they spent 3 hours and 40 minutes with me.&nbsp; And they waited all that time, and some came two hours early.</p>



<p>And &#8212; but the pain is palpable.&nbsp; And I think a lot of it is unnecessary.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So I’m going to continue to push, and we’ll see how this works.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are you going to send long-range rocket systems to Ukraine?</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; We’re not going to send to Ukraine rocket systems that can strike into Russia.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, do you think there is anything different in how Republicans will approach the gun reform question now, given the circumstances?</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Since I haven’t spoken to them, I don’t know.&nbsp; But my guess is, if they have &#8212; if they &#8212; yes, I think they’re going to have to take a hard look.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there one element &#8212; is it aid, is it red flag, is it some component that you think could be most successful now?</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Well, that’s hard to say because I have not been negotiating with any of the Republicans yet.&nbsp; And I deliberately did not engage in a debate about that with any Republican in &#8212; when we were down consoling the families in Texas.&nbsp; So I don’t &#8212; I don’t know what is the most &#8212; how far it goes.</p>



<p>I know that it makes no sense to be able to purchase something that can fire up to 300 rounds.&nbsp; I know it makes &#8212; and I know what happened when we had rational action before, back in &#8212; when the crime bill was &#8212; the law that got passed.&nbsp; It did significantly cut down mass murders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so there’s only one reason for something that can fire, you know, 100 shots.</p>



<p>I mean &#8212; and I’ll just conclude with this: Look, when I first started doing hearings on the issue of what rational gun laws should be, it was during a period when I was a senator and the death rate was going up.&nbsp; Not that many more people were being shot, but the death rate was up.&nbsp; And when I think of &#8212; I’m not sure, I think it was (inaudible) hospital in New York &#8212; whatever the largest trauma hospital is.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I sat with a trauma doctor, and I asked him &#8212; I said, “What’s the difference?&nbsp; Why are so many people…” &#8212; and not that many more people were being shot.&nbsp; This is now 20 years ago, or 25 years.&nbsp; I said, “Why are they dying?”&nbsp; And they showed me x-rays.&nbsp; He said, “A .22-caliber bullet will lodge in the lung, and we can probably get it out, may be able to get it, and save the life.&nbsp; A 9mm bullet blows the lung out of the body.”</p>



<p>So the idea of these high-caliber weapons is of &#8212; there’s simply no rational basis for it in terms of thinking about self-protection, hunting.&nbsp; I mean, I just &#8212; and remember, the Constitution, the Second Amendment was never absolute.&nbsp; You couldn’t buy a cannon when the Second Amendment was passed.&nbsp; You couldn’t go out and purchase a lot of weapons.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And those who &#8212; not many are saying it anymore, but there was a while there where people were saying that, you know, the Tree of Liberty is watered with the blood of patriots, and what we have to do is you have to be able to take on the government when they’re wrong.&nbsp; Well, to do that, you need an F-15, you know?&nbsp; Or you need an Abrams tank.</p>



<p>I mean &#8212; so, it’s just &#8212; as I say, I think thing &#8212; I think things have gotten so bad that everybody is getting more rational about it.&nbsp; At least that’s my hope and prayer.</p>



<p>I’ve got Gold Star moms in there, so I got to go in.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I know you want Congress to act, but do you believe that as President you have a particular responsibility now?</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Oh, I know I have it, but I &#8212; but there’s a Constitution.&nbsp; I can’t dictate this stuff.&nbsp; I can do the things that I’ve done.&nbsp; And any executive action I can take, I’ll continue to take.&nbsp; But I can’t outlaw a weapon.&nbsp; I can’t, you know, change the background checks.&nbsp; I can’t do that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, you know, my whole career, I’ve been doing it.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And persuasion?</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Persuasion, yeah.&nbsp; But, you know, there’s been a few things happening.&nbsp; I know you’ve noticed it.&nbsp; You’ve had to travel with me.&nbsp; (Laughs.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; McConnell has ordered a directive to Senator Cornyn to search for a compromise.&nbsp; Do you really think there’s something there?&nbsp; Or are they just making noise?</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Look, I don’t know, but I think there’s a realization on the part of rational Republicans &#8212; and I think Senator McConnell is a rational Republican; I think Cornyn is as well.&nbsp; I think there’s a recognition in their part that they &#8212; we can’t continue like this.&nbsp; We can’t do this.</p>



<p>I’ve got to go in.&nbsp; I’ve got the Gold Star parents.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>

THE PRESIDENT:&#160; Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.&#160; Thank you all.&#160; Is this working?&#160; There you go.

<p class="has-text-align-center">University of Delaware<br>Newark, Delaware</p>



<p>10:24 A.M. EDT</p>



<p>AUDIENCE:&nbsp; Joe!&nbsp; Joe!&nbsp; Joe!&nbsp; Joe!</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.&nbsp; Thank you all.&nbsp; Is this working?&nbsp; There you go.</p>



<p>Before you all sit down completely, the reason why you’re here is because of all of those people up in the stands.&nbsp; Stand up and give your parents and your grandparents, and those who got you, an applause.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; You owe them!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>And to all the parents up in the stands, this may be the best day of all.&nbsp; No more tuition!&nbsp; (Laughter and applause.)&nbsp; But probably all of them are going to graduate school, so that probably won’t work.&nbsp; (Laughs.)</p>



<p>Dr.&nbsp;Assanis, trustees, faculty, the staff; my good friend &#8212; and he is my really good friend for a long time &#8212; Tommy &#8212; I call him “Tommy” &#8212; but Tom Carper &#8212; Senator Carper.&nbsp; Lisa Blunt Rochester, our congresswoman who can preach &#8212; this woman can preach.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; And is really good.&nbsp; She’s a great congresswoman.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And the Class of 2022: Congratulations!&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>I know they’ve been recognized already, but I can’t &#8212; yesterday, I did the commencement at the Naval Academy, and it reminds me today: I want a special cons- &#8212; special congratulations to the veterans who are graduating today, all those who are being commissioned in the United States military.&nbsp; Would you please stand &#8212; of the graduating class?&nbsp; Stand up if you’re &#8212; (applause) &#8212;</p>



<p>And those of you have served as well in this class, stand up.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>And for all those of you who are joining the service or about to join the finest group of warriors the world has ever seen &#8212; and that’s not hyperbole; that’s literally true.&nbsp; So thank you, thank you, thank you.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jill &#8212; better known as Dr. Biden &#8212; I happen to be her husband &#8212; not only earned her undergraduate degree here,</p>



<p>she also got her doctorate degree here.&nbsp; She got a master’s in between, somewhere else.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; And the First Lady has continued to work full-time as a professor while being the First Lady.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But, Gerret, you and I have something in common, pal: We both married way above our station.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Not only can she speak five different languages, whatever language she’s speaking, you better damn well listen, man.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; So, I’m telling you, thank you.</p>



<p>And I want to say this is a special day for my sister Valerie and I.&nbsp; She’s my best friend in the world.&nbsp; She graduated here with honors.&nbsp; I graduated.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Oh, that’s literally true.&nbsp; (Laughs.)&nbsp; And we took the same damn classes.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;</p>



<p><br>We used to be three years apart, and now Val is 22 years&nbsp;</p>



<p>younger than I am.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; But it feels like coming home because it is &#8212; this is home.&nbsp; This is home.</p>



<p>I once walked this campus as you did.&nbsp; Took the classes in the same classrooms you’ve taken classes.&nbsp; Walked the graduation ceremony just as you’re walking today.<a>&nbsp; Some of the best and most important years of my life were spent here.</a></p>



<p>And I had the opportunity to be taught by some great professors.&nbsp; I’ll bet every one of you already can name one or two professors that’s changed your life, that’s had an impact on you in a fundamental way.&nbsp; I was lucky &#8212; I graduated with a dual degree in history and political science.&nbsp; If you add up both my GPAs in each of those, I was probably a 4.0.&nbsp; (Laughter.)</p>



<p>But all kidding aside,&nbsp;Dr. Dolan, from the political science department &#8212; I think he could picture me here in the endzone, maybe catching a pass over my left shoulder, but I doubt whether ever the hell he thought I’d be standing here as President of the United States.&nbsp; (Laughs.)&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>Although,&nbsp;Dr. Ingersoll is the one &#8212; you know, professors make a difference.&nbsp; I was asked to seek the nomination by a group of people I won’t bore you with, and I thought it was a little off the wall that I was &#8212; I wasn’t even old enough.&nbsp; And I turned &#8212; it was after a Democratic off-year convention.&nbsp; And I turned to the Chief Justice, who was retired &#8212; from a family that has more senators than any family in American history: former Justice Tunnell.</p>



<p>And I said, “Mr. Justice, I’m not old enough.”&nbsp; He said, “You obviously didn’t do well in constitutional law, Joe.”&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; So, the Constitution says you need to be 30 to be sworn in, but you can be elected at any age they want to elect you.&nbsp; So why the hell I did it, I wasn’t sure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But I got in a car in Dover, and I drove straight to the campus.&nbsp; Not a joke.&nbsp; And I looked up Dr. Ingersoll, one of my professors that I admired most; taught political philosophy.</p>



<p>And I told him the dilemma, because I hadn’t thought about that at all at the time.&nbsp; I really hadn’t.&nbsp; And he looked at me and he said, “Joe, remember what Plato said.”&nbsp; I’m thinking, “What the hell did Plato say?”&nbsp; (Laughter.)</p>



<p>And he paraphrased it.&nbsp; And he said: The penalty good people pay for not being involved in politics is being governed by people worse than themselves.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Folks, it’s what I want to talk to you all about today.&nbsp; Though I think even my professors would be surprised if there’s a Biden School of Public Policy and Administration at the University of Delaware.&nbsp; Thank you, Tatiana.&nbsp; (Laughs.)</p>



<p>But no one is more surprised than me.&nbsp; And while I had graduated before I &#8212; he started teaching, I wanted to acknowledge the respect and the &#8212; that I had for Dr. James Newton, a trailblazer in Black American studies and the civil rights across our nation.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>If there’s one message&nbsp;I hope you take from me today,</p>



<p>it’s: This is no time to be on the sidelines.&nbsp; It’s not hyperbole.&nbsp; I mean it from the bottom of my heart.</p>



<p>We need all of you to get engaged in public life and the life of this nation.</p>



<p>Because here’s the simple truth: You’re graduating and entering a world at a momentous and consequential and defining time.</p>



<p>The next 10 years of your life are going to determine what the next 50 years of this nation are going to look like.&nbsp; We’re at one of those inflection points in history where things are changing so fundamentally that we have to act.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Like the Americans in the 1850s and ‘60s &#8212; we had to decide whether to preserve slavery or become a free nation &#8212; truly free.</p>



<p>Like Americans in the ‘30s and ‘40s &#8212; President Roosevelt had said they had a “rendezvous with destiny,” at home and abroad.</p>



<p>Like Americans in the ‘60s, in my generation &#8212; when I sat where you’re sitting in 1965&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;were bitterly divided over the war in Vietnam.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We watched our heroes &#8212; two Kennedys and a King &#8212; gunned down by assassins and, still, we chose to expand the possibilities of America by breaking down unjust barriers&nbsp;</p>



<p>of civil rights and voting rights.</p>



<p>Well, now, it’s your hour.&nbsp; The challenges are immense &#8212; foreign and domestic &#8212; but so are the possibilities.</p>



<p>I spent time &#8212; more time with Xi Jinping than any world leader has &#8212; over 76 hours.&nbsp; We traveled 17,000 miles in China and the United States together.&nbsp; We were on the Tibetan Plateau, and he turned to me and said, “Can you define America for me?”&nbsp; And I said, “Yes, I can, in one word: possibilities.”&nbsp; Everything is possible in America.&nbsp; Not a joke.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Everything.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I believe that with every fiber of my being this is a decisive decade for America, at a time when we can choose the future we want, at a time when we must decide that darkness will not prevail over light.</p>



<p>In the last five years since many of you were in high school, America has faced some of its most difficult tests.</p>



<p>A global pandemic ended a million lives in America alone &#8212; a million &#8212; and upended, according to most studies, the lives of &#8212; personal lives of at least another 9 million children and family members, and many of your lives.</p>



<p>And a crisis of faith in the institutions that have &#8212; however flawed they may be &#8212; serve as the infrastructure for the American experiment in liberty and self-government.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I’ve defined to my foreign colleagues and heads of state America when I was at the G7.&nbsp; I said America is unique in the world.&nbsp; We’re the only nation in the world founded on an idea.&nbsp; Every other nation is founded on ethnicity, religion, geography.&nbsp; But only America is founded on an idea: We hold these truths to be self-evident that all women and men are created equal, endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights &#8212; life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness.</p>



<p>We say it so often.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve never met the goal, but we&#8217;ve never walked away from it &#8212; ever.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; And each generation has brought us closer to the goal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>And what you&#8217;ve been through the last four years &#8212; and I&#8217;m not being solicitous with you &#8212; what you’ve been through the last four years, you could not have imagined when you were graduating from high school: campus shutdowns, classes on Zoom, the world turned upside down.</p>



<p>But you got through it.&nbsp; And it took an extraordinary commitment, determination, and resolve to do it.&nbsp; You should be proud you overcame it all to see this day.&nbsp; Your generation, and this class, can do anything.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I decided to seek the presidency.&nbsp; When I had concluded &#8212; I was a professor at Penn &#8212; I was never going to run again.&nbsp; And I meant that from the bottom of my heart.&nbsp; I had just lost my son Beau.&nbsp; And I had no interest whatsoever.&nbsp; And I was teaching at Penn.&nbsp; And then, Charlottesville.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the United States of America, in the 20th century &#8212; 21st century &#8212; people coming out of fields at night carrying torches.</p>



<p>Close your eyes.&nbsp; Remember what you saw.&nbsp; Their veins bulging, preaching the same hate &#8212; white supremacy; chanting the same Nazi phrases &#8212; not figuratively, literally &#8212; that were being chanted in the ‘30s in Europe.&nbsp; Torches lit again.</p>



<p>You know, when I was a young senator, I was proud to be the senator who actually got Strom Thurmond to vote for the Voting Rights Act.&nbsp; I got it extended 25 years, and I thought, “You can bury hate.&nbsp; You can wipe it out.”&nbsp; But I learned a lesson: You can&#8217;t eliminate hate.&nbsp; It only hides when it&#8217;s defeated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But when the prominent leaders are leader- &#8212; breathe oxygen under the rocks it&#8217;s hiding in, it takes on a new life.&nbsp; It comes roaring back out in ways, I must tell you, I never thought would happen.&nbsp; Because I got into politics sitting where you&#8217;re sitting because of civil rights in Delaware.</p>



<p>And then, nearly four years later, a mob of insurrectionists stormed the Capitol &#8212; the very citadel of democracy.</p>



<p>Imagine what you&#8217;d be thinking today if you had heard this morning, before you got here, that a group of a thousand people broke down the doors of the Parliament in Great Britain, killed two police officers, smashed and ransacked the office of members of the British Parliament, or any other.&nbsp; What would you think?&nbsp; What would you think?</p>



<p>And then, just this month, we thought that white supremacy</p>



<p>was finally being got hold of.</p>



<p>Buffalo, New York: A shopping center in a Black community.&nbsp; I went and met with every one of those parents, every one of those families.</p>



<p>And now, tomorrow, I&#8217;ll be heli- &#8212; I&#8217;ll be heading to Uvalde, Texas, to meet with each of those families.</p>



<p>And as I speak, those parents are literally preparing to bury their children in the United States of America &#8212; to bury their children.&nbsp; There’s too much violence, too much fear, too much grief.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s be clear: Evil came to that elementary school classroom in Texas, to that grocery store in New York, to far too many places where innocents have died.</p>



<p>In the face of such destructive forces, we have to stand stronger.&nbsp; We must stand stronger.&nbsp; We cannot outlaw tragedy, I know, but we can make America safer.</p>



<p>We can finally do what we have to do to protect the lives of the people and of our children.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So I call on all Americans this hour to join hands and make your voices heard and work together to make this nation what it can and should be.</p>



<p>I know we can do this.&nbsp; We have done it before.&nbsp; You and I acted as “We the People” seeking a more perfect union.</p>



<p>Always remember: Democracy is a human enterprise.&nbsp; We do many things well.&nbsp; Sometimes we fall short.&nbsp; That&#8217;s true in our own lives; it’s true in the life of the nation.&nbsp; And yet democracy makes progress possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>And progress comes when we begin to see each other again, not as enemies but as neighbors.</p>



<p>When I spoke yesterday at Annapolis, I finished by talking about my friend &#8212; he was my close friend; on his deathbed, asked me to do his eulogy &#8212; who would scream at each other and holler like hell at one another: John McCain.&nbsp; Very different views.&nbsp; We still loved one another.</p>



<p>Not as mindless, competing factions, but as fellow citizens.&nbsp; Learned anew, in their own &#8212; on their own time that democracy is fragile, democracy is precious, but it&#8217;s also precarious.</p>



<p>Truth is truth.&nbsp; Lies are lies.&nbsp; And the truth is: We have a solemn duty to keep the flame of liberty burning.&nbsp; This is not about blue and red, rural and urban.&nbsp; It&#8217;s about America.&nbsp; The right to govern ourselves.&nbsp; The right to determine our own destinies, to overcome division and despair, and to meet the challenges of our time with grit and, maybe equally important, with some grace.&nbsp; To press ahead determined, resolved, and full of hope.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not easy.&nbsp; It&#8217;s never been.&nbsp; But it&#8217;s who we are &#8212; people united by a idea &#8212; by an idea, unbending in the face of adversity, and devoted to creating and sustaining the beloved nation of ours.</p>



<p>You don’t have to take my word for it.&nbsp; Frederick Douglass said it better.&nbsp; He said, “No soil is better adapted to growth of reform than [the] American soil.”</p>



<p>The women of Seneca Falls call for suffrage by writing, “We hold these truths to be self-evident that all&nbsp;<em>women</em>&nbsp;and men are created equal.”</p>



<p>Dr. King said his dream of liberty for all was deeply rooted in the American Dream &#8212; the right to life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness; the right to rise in the world as far as your talent can take you, unlimited by unfair barriers of privilege and power.</p>



<p>Such are the principles of democracy, and such are the principles of America.</p>



<p>And I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m exercising hyperbole.&nbsp; I’ve been around too long.&nbsp; That&#8217;s what is at stake today.</p>



<p>The question we face is nothing less than: “Who are we?”&nbsp; “What do we stand for?”&nbsp; “What do we believe?”&nbsp; And maybe more importantly, “Who are we going to be?”</p>



<p>And while this can feel like a very dark moment in America,</p>



<p>I&#8217;m optimistic.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve never been more optimistic in my entire life.&nbsp; And here&#8217;s why &#8212; and I mean this, my word as a Biden.</p>



<p>I mean it.&nbsp; Because of you &#8212; this generation, your generation &#8212; it makes me more optimistic.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve said it many times, as I look at my granddaughters who all graduated from universities and about to enter them &#8212; I&#8217;ll say it again today: Your generation is the most generous, the most tolerant, the least prejudiced, the best-educated generation this nation has ever known.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s a simple fact.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>And it’s your generation, more than anyone else, who will have to answer the question, “Who are we?”&nbsp; “What do we stand for?”&nbsp; “What do we believe?”&nbsp; “Who will we be?”</p>



<p>Progress in our country has always been met with ferocious pushback from the oldest and darkest forces in America.&nbsp; Always.</p>



<p>We should not be surprised that these same forces are fighting back again, preying on hopelessness and despair; demonizing people who don&#8217;t look like them; doing everything, no matter how desperate, to hold on to power.</p>



<p>This was never going to be an easy battle, and it never has been, because it&#8217;s occurred before in America.</p>



<p>The oldest and darkest forces in the past may believe they&#8217;ll determine America&#8217;s future.&nbsp; But I promise you &#8212; remember I said this, if you remember nothing that I said at this graduation: They are wrong.&nbsp; Wrong, wrong, wrong.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>We will, you will &#8212; in this moment, in this battle, we will not lose the right to vote, the right to self-determination, the right to choose, the right to be you, and marry the person you love.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>We must and will stand together to save the planet and preserve democracy.</p>



<p>When America was literally facing war with itself when Lincoln was President &#8212; excuse me &#8212; when Lincoln was President, Lincoln reminded us.&nbsp; He said, “Let&#8217;s have faith that right makes might.”&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Right makes might.</p>



<p>This is an essential principle of the soul of America.&nbsp; I mean it sincerely &#8212; the soul of America.&nbsp; The principle must guide you and your lives regardless of your politics &#8211;conservative or liberal &#8212; but just human decency.&nbsp; The principle that guides me and my administration.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For we can and will and should disagree about the means of governance.&nbsp; That&#8217;s what democracy is about as well.&nbsp; But we have to be unified in the purpose of America: to create possibility, prosperity; protect decency and dignity; to be free and fair.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just think about who we are.&nbsp; The bloodiest civil wars led the abolition of slavery.&nbsp; Generation after generation who stood against totalitarianism and terror.</p>



<p>And while we, the people, have undertaken great enterprises when building interstates, to finding vaccines, to going to the stars &#8212; in all these moments, we were driven, as we are today, by the most American of principles: that we the people have created the strongest, freest, most prosperous nation the world has ever known.&nbsp; And again, that is not hyperbole, it&#8217;s a fact.</p>



<p>Now, in this moment, we face our own test: to resolve &#8212; a test of resolve, a test of conscience, a test of history itself.</p>



<p>No generation gets to choose what world they graduate into.&nbsp; None.&nbsp; But a few &#8212; a few generations enter at a point in history where they have the power to change the trajectory of a nation.&nbsp; And you can.</p>



<p>When I sat where you are, in the mid-‘60s, I believed we could.&nbsp; And we did, through civil rights, change the trajectory of the nation.</p>



<p>And now I know that may feel like an added burden on top of all you&#8217;ve already been through.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not saying you have to shoulder the burden on your own.&nbsp; The task at hand and the task ahead is the work of all of us.&nbsp; What I am saying is you represent the best of us.&nbsp; You literally represent the best of us &#8212; a better America than we are today.</p>



<p>A generation &#8212; your generation will not be ignored, will not be shunned, and will not be silenced.&nbsp; You have an opportunity to not only reaffirm but to breathe new life into America&#8217;s most important values: equality, fairness, justice.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s what I felt like all those years ago when I sat where you are sitting today.&nbsp; And I mean that sincerely.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t think I was going to be President of the United States.&nbsp; It wasn’t like “I’m going to be President” &#8212; although I loved reading the biographies.&nbsp; Everybody knew I was going to be President when I was in high school.&nbsp; I had no idea of it.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>But for all the uncertainty in the world, this university gave me confidence in myself to engage, to get involved, because I believed I could make a difference.&nbsp;</p>



<p>My sister Valerie and I come from very modest backgrounds.&nbsp; A three-bedroom, split-level home in a decent neighborhood; four kids and a grandpop living with us.&nbsp; We never felt we were poor, but we never had &#8212; we had trouble making the tuition, which was 300 bucks a year.&nbsp; Not a joke.&nbsp; Or semester, I should say.</p>



<p>I hope you feel that way today, though, that you can change things.&nbsp; Because that&#8217;s what I see in all of you.&nbsp; You can make the difference.&nbsp; You can lift the country up.&nbsp; You can meet the challenges of our time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve always believed this nation can be defined by one word, as I said before: possibilities.&nbsp; It&#8217;s still true today.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so to the University Class of 2022, there is no limit on what you can do.&nbsp; I promise you.</p>



<p>So get going, for God&#8217;s sake.&nbsp; Godspeed on your journey.&nbsp; Keep the faith.&nbsp; And take it back &#8212; please.&nbsp; This is yours.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Take it back!&nbsp; We need you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>God bless you all, and may God protect our troops.&nbsp; I really mean it &#8212; I believe in you.&nbsp; Thank you, thank you, thank you.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Mt. Olive Baptist Church<br><em>Buffalo, New York</em></em></p>



<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; I’m not going to say anything about Reverend Sharpton right now.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Good afternoon, church.<br>&nbsp;<br>AUDIENCE:&nbsp; Good afternoon.<br>&nbsp;<br>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; To the Whitfield family; the father of the Whitfield family, Mr. Whitfield.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br>&nbsp;<br>The pain that this family is feeling right now, and the nine other families here in Buffalo, I cannot even begin to express our collective pain as a nation for what you are feeling in such an extreme way &#8212; to not only lose someone that you love, but through an act of extreme violence and hate.&nbsp; And I do believe that our nation right now is experiencing an epidemic of hate.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And as we know and Scripture teaches us, when we talk about strength &#8212; the strength of personality, the strength of spirit, the strength of faith &#8212; I think we all know that a true measure of strength is not based on who you beat down, it&#8217;s based on who you lift up.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Who you lift up.<br>&nbsp;<br>And it means then also, in that strength, understanding we will not allow small people to create fear in our communities; that we will not be afraid to stand up for what is right, to speak truth even when it may be difficult to hear and speak.<br>&nbsp;<br>There&#8217;s a through-line &#8212; what happened here in Buffalo, in Texas, in Atlanta, in Orlando; what happened at the synagogues.<br>&nbsp;<br>And so this is a moment that requires all good people, all God-loving people to stand up and say we will not stand for this.&nbsp; Enough is enough.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; We will come together based on what we all know we have in common, and we will not let those people who are motivated by hate separate us or make us feel fear.<br>&nbsp;<br>So I&#8217;m here to say that we are all in this together.&nbsp; No one should ever be made to fight alone.&nbsp; We are stronger than those who would try to hurt us think that we are.&nbsp; We are strong.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>We are strong in our faith.&nbsp; We are strong in our belief about what is right and our determination to act, to ensure that we protect all those who deserve to be protected; that we see all those who deserve to be seen; that we hear the voices of the people; and that we rise up in solidarity to speak out against this and to speak to our better angels.<br>&nbsp;<br>Thank you.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; END<br>&nbsp;<br><br></p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Buffalo, New York</em></p>



<p>Q    Madam Vice President, what was your message to the families?<br> <br>THE VICE PRESIDENT:  You know, I met with all the families.  And first of all, to lose a loved one unexpectedly and because of such an extreme act of violence and hate, the tragedy of it is beyond description. <br> <br>And so, first, I expressed our condolences.  But also, when we think about what&#8217;s been happening &#8212; and you&#8217;ve heard me say it before &#8212; I really do think we need to look at the fact that this year alone, I&#8217;m told that we&#8217;ve had over 200 mass shootings &#8212; over 200 &#8212; and we’re barely halfway through the year.<br> <br>And when we&#8217;re looking at an epidemic of hate where people are being targeted just because of who they are, I think we all have to stand back and say, “Wait, enough.  Enough is enough.  A harm against any one of us is a harm against all of us.  No one should be left to fight alone.”  And we got to deal with this, and we have to deal with it in a number of ways.<br> <br>But I went through it even at the church.  You look at it &#8212; everything from Buffalo to what’s happened to those babies and the teachers being killed in Texas, the funerals &#8212; haven’t even really begun in terms of mourning that loss. <br> <br>We’re looking at &#8212; on the heels of Atlanta, just a year ago; Orlando; the Tree of Life.<br> <br>We have to agree that if we are to be strong as a nation, we must stand strong, identifying our diversity as our unity.  And that anyone who is trying to break that down, it’s hurting us as a country and as individuals who should identify as one, as a country, as Americans.<br> <br>So I think of it in a number of ways.  There is the tragedy of the personal loss that each of these families has made.  Mrs. Whitfield &#8212; the funeral today &#8212; what a beautiful woman who lived an extraordinary life. <br> <br>I met with the other families.  There were community leaders.  There were &#8212; a father of an infant.  And then, of course, the President is going to go tomorrow to Texas and be with the families who have lost their babies at a school.<br> <br>We have to &#8212; everybody has got to stand up and agree that this should not be happening in our country and that we should have the courage to do something about it. <br> <br>On the issue of gun violence, I will say as I said countless times: We are not sitting around waiting to figure out what the solution looks like.  You know, we&#8217;re not looking for a vaccine.  We know what works on this.  It includes: Let&#8217;s have an assault weapons ban.  You know what an assault weapon is?  You know how an assault weapon was designed?  It was designed for a specific purpose: to kill a lot of human beings quickly.  An assault weapon is a weapon of war with no place &#8212; no place in a civil society. <br> <br>Background checks.  Why should anyone be able to buy a weapon that can kill other human beings without at least knowing, hey, has that person committed a violent crime before?  Are they a threat against themselves or others?  That&#8217;s just reasonable.  It’s just reasonable.  We do that, saying you have to have a license to drive a car.  You have to be of a certain age to buy, you know, a six-pack.<br> <br>We are a society that is governed by rules, most of which were designed &#8212; those rules &#8212; to, at the very height of the purpose, prevent against harm, to promote safety, and to have a common order that we all agree a civilized society should agree to that ensures that there will be safety and that we can prevent chaos. <br> <br>When we&#8217;ve had over 200 mass shootings in our country already and we are barely in June, let’s all agree we got to do something, and it’s within our power to do it.  Congress needs to act.  And what I know is that we also have to come together as one nation, undivided, standing with each other.<br> <br>                          END<br><br></p>

					<description><![CDATA[1.&#160; On January 11, 2018, the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) transmitted to the President a report on the Secretary&#8217;s investigation into the effect of imports of steel mill articles (steel articles) on the national security of the United States under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1862). &#160;The&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>1.&nbsp; On January 11, 2018, the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) transmitted to the President a report on the Secretary&#8217;s investigation into the effect of imports of steel mill articles (steel articles) on the national security of the United States under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1862). &nbsp;The Secretary found and advised the President of his opinion that steel articles are being imported into the United States in such quantities and under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the United States.</p>



<p>2.&nbsp; In Proclamation 9705 of March 8, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Steel Into the United States), the President concurred in the Secretary&#8217;s finding that steel articles, as defined in clause 1 of Proclamation 9705, as amended by clause 8 of Proclamation 9711 of March 22, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Steel Into the United States), are being imported into the United States in such quantities and under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the United States, and decided to adjust the imports of those steel articles by imposing a 25 percent ad valorem tariff on such articles imported from all countries except Canada and Mexico. &nbsp;The proclamation further stated that any country with which we have a security relationship is welcome to discuss with the United States alternative ways to address the threatened impairment of the national security caused by imports from that country, and noted that, should the United States and any such country arrive at a satisfactory alternative means to address the threat to the national security such that the President determines that imports from that country no longer threaten to impair the national security, the President may remove or modify the restriction on steel articles imports from that country and, if necessary, adjust the tariff as it applies to other countries, as the national security interests of the United&nbsp;States require.</p>



<p>3.&nbsp; The United States and Ukraine have developed a close security relationship.&nbsp; Ukraine has expressed its willingness to work with the United States to address the global excess capacity for producing steel. &nbsp;Ukraine&#8217;s steel industry has been significantly disrupted by the Russian Federation&#8217;s unjustified, unprovoked, unyielding, and unconscionable war against Ukraine. &nbsp;The significant disruption in Ukraine&#8217;s steel production is expected to decrease the total amount of steel produced by Ukraine as well as the amount of steel imported into the United&nbsp;States from Ukraine, which in 2021 accounted for less than 1 percent of all steel imports into the United States.&nbsp; At the same time, the steel industry has been historically important to Ukraine, and both the United States and Ukraine have an interest in maintaining that industry as an economic lifeline while the country recovers.</p>



<p>4.&nbsp; The United States and Ukraine have recently engaged in broad security discussions.&nbsp; The current disruption of Ukrainian steel production has been part of those discussions, and the ongoing discussion is anticipated to include alternative measures to prevent imports of steel from Ukraine from threatening the national security of the United States as Ukraine&#8217;s steel production recovers from the significant disruption caused by the war.</p>



<p>5.&nbsp; In light of the ongoing security discussions and significant disruption of Ukraine&#8217;s ability to produce steel, I conclude that Ukraine&#8217;s present situation presents a special case.&nbsp; I have determined to suspend the tariffs set forth in Proclamation 9705 for the import of steel articles and derivative steel articles from Ukraine for 1 year.&nbsp; The Secretary shall monitor the situation in the domestic steel industry and developments in Ukraine&#8217;s steel industry and inform me of any need to terminate or extend this suspension.</p>



<p><a>6.&nbsp; </a>In light of my determination to adjust the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9705 as applied to eligible steel articles and derivative steel articles that are the product of Ukraine, I have considered whether it is necessary and appropriate in light of our national security interests to make any corresponding adjustments to such tariff as it applies to products of other countries.&nbsp; I have determined that it is necessary and appropriate, at this time, to maintain the current tariff level as it applies to products of other countries.</p>



<p>7.&nbsp; Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, authorizes the President to take action to adjust the imports of an article and its derivatives that are being imported into the United States in such quantities or under such circumstances as&nbsp;to threaten to impair the national security.</p>



<p>8.&nbsp; Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19&nbsp;U.S.C. 2483), authorizes the President to embody in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) the substance of statutes affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction.</p>



<p>Now, Therefore, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United&nbsp;States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section&nbsp;232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, section 301 of title 3, United States Code, and section&nbsp;604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, do hereby proclaim as follows:</p>
