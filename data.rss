<p>11:51 A.M. EDT<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Hey, guys.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hello.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Hello.&nbsp; Hello.&nbsp; Good morning. &nbsp;Okay.&nbsp; Just two things for you at the top. &nbsp;And I&#8217;ll try and speak as loud as I can.<br>&nbsp;<br>All right.&nbsp; Good morning.&nbsp; Thanks for joining us for President Biden’s trip to Illinois.&nbsp; As you know, our first stop is to Kankakee, where the President will visit O’Connor Farms, a family farm owned by Jeff and Gina O’Connor.&nbsp; The farm is 800 acres and grows wheat, corn, and soybeans.<br>&nbsp;<br>The O’Connors use double cropping of wheat and soybeans on their farm, which, for those unfamiliar, means harvesting two crops from the same field in a given year.&nbsp; They are currently growing wheat that we will be &#8212; that will be harvested in July and then will double crop with soybeans on those same acres. They al- &#8212; they are also in the process of planting corn on their other acres.<br>&nbsp;<br>President Biden will be joined by Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack.&nbsp; The President will highlight the impact of Putin’s invasion of Ukraine on our domestic and global food supply and the war’s contribution to the rise in food prices at home and abroad.<br>&nbsp;<br>Fighting inflation and lowering costs for Americans is the President’s top priority, and he will deliver remarks on the effect of Putin’s price hike on the cost of food and energy.&nbsp; He will describe his administration’s action to support farmers and food processors &#8212; (clears throat) &#8212; excuse me &#8212; lower their cost and lower prices for families.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Later in the day, the President will address the IBEW’s &#8212; International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers &#8212; 40th Convention, where he will discuss his support for union jobs in the infrastructure and energy industries; increasing the number of countries eligible for double cropping insurance so that we can boost food production; increasing technical assistance for precision agriculture, allowing farmers to use less fertilizer without reducing yields; and doubling our investment for domestic fertilizer production to $500 million.<br>&nbsp;<br>Later in the day, the President will address the IBEW’s 40th Convention where he will discuss his support for union jobs in the infrastructure and energy industries.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Throughout the day, the President will be joined by Governor J. B. Pritzker; Congresswoman Robin Kelly &#8212; we’ll be in her district; and one &#8212; of course, many IBEW labor leaders at their convention.&nbsp; And we’ll be in her district at the farm, just to be clear there.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>One last thing I just want to note is that, yesterday, the Senate confirmed Lisa Cook to be the first Black woman to ever serve on the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve.&nbsp; Not only does Dr. Cook make history with this confirmation, but she is eminently qualified for this position at a critical moment of our economic process.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>We call on the Senate to swiftly confirm Jerome Powell and Philip Jefferson this week as well.<br>&nbsp;<br>With that, Zeke, you want to kick us off?<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Karine.&nbsp; Does the White House, does the President have any response to the killing of Al Jazeera journalist and American citizen Shireen Abu Akleh?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Yes.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And will that affect the President&#8217;s trip &#8212; planned trip to Israel next month?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; So, we strongly condemn the killing of Al Jazeera journalist and American citizen Shireen Abu Akleh in Jenin today, and we extend our deepest condolences to her family.&nbsp; We call for a thorough investigation to determine the circumstances of her death.&nbsp; Investigating attacks on independent media and prosecuting those responsible are of paramount importance.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>We will continue to promote media freedom and protect journalists’ ability to do their jobs without fear of violence, threats to their lives or safety, or unjust detention.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>I don&#8217;t have anything else to preview about his trip.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And does the President plan to make any calls to Israeli officials about this or her family, or anything of that sort?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; I &#8212; I&#8217;m happy to check, but I don&#8217;t have anything right now to preview on any calls that he&#8217;ll be making.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I ask a question about the ASEAN Summit that&#8217;s coming up?&nbsp; Can you give me a broad sense of what the President hopes to achieve from that, please?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; So, today, at around two o&#8217;clock &#8212; I think 2:45 &#8212; we&#8217;ll have a preview call.&nbsp; We&#8217;ll &#8212; we&#8217;ll have the full schedule and also, clearly, take questions from your colleagues since you guys are here with us heading to Illinois.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>We&#8217;ll have more on deliverables tomorrow, so we&#8217;ll probably do a backgrounder on that &#8212; a preview call on that.&nbsp; But you can expect to see us deepen our longstanding cooperation by investing in our countries and driving inclusive prosperity in this critical region.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>At the end of last year, President Biden announced $102 million in new initiatives to expand our engagement with ASEAN on COVID-19 recovery and health security, fighting the climate crisis, stimulating broad-based economic growth, and deepening people-to-people ties.&nbsp; We will keep building on this.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And, you know, I would push back on any of the characterizations that are out there that the U.S. hasn&#8217;t done much in the region since TPP, which never went into effect in the first place.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>We have long, strong &#8212; we have strong trade and investment relationships in the region; for example, the ASEAN countries &#8212; collectively, the United States’ fourth-largest goods trading partner.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>We saw U.S. exports of goods to the Asia-Pacific increase in 2021 by 25 percent from 2020, U.S. imports increase in 2021 by 19 percent from 2020.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve seen also &#8212; we&#8217;ve also seen increased foreign direct investment between the U.S. and the Asia-Pacific.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And as you all know, we&#8217;ve also been developing an Indo-Pacific Economic Framework to deepen our economic presence in the region.&nbsp; We’ll have more to say on this soon and are encouraged to see the int- &#8212; the interests of partners in the region.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just on ASEAN, can I ask you about &#8212; you talked about trade and economic issues.&nbsp; What about human rights?&nbsp; How does that fit into the ASEAN (inaudible)?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; I mean, that is something that clearly we &#8212; we are monitoring, and that is &#8212; it’s something that&#8217;s important to this administration.<br>&nbsp;<br>Clearly, that is &#8212; you know, it&#8217;s &#8212; it is something that, when you think about Cambodia, that&#8217;s the question that we tend to get.<br>&nbsp;<br>You know, the President and our administration has been clear about human rights concern and promoting human rights in Cambodia, just as an example.<br>&nbsp;<br>The President will, of course, not hold back from expressing his views and his priorities to promote human rights in that region.<br>&nbsp;<br>The summit is a &#8212; is a U.S.-ASEAN Summit, and Cambodia is the chair of the ASEAN, as you know.&nbsp; So, the leaders &#8212; so the leaders of that &#8212; of that summit as well &#8212; as well &#8212; the ASEAN General &#8212; Secretary General were invited; the different countries: Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam.<br>&nbsp;<br>And so, it&#8217;s &#8212; a nonpolitical represent- &#8212; representative of Burma was invited to the summit in accordance of ASEAN&#8217;s 2021 decision to restrict Burma&#8217;s participation in high-level ASEAN meetings due to the military regime&#8217;s failure to implement the ASEAN five-point consensus.<br>&nbsp;<br>We understand that Burma has declined that option, but that is something that, clearly, we will &#8212; the President will (inaudible).<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karine, have you or the Pre- &#8212; have you seen or has the President seen the situation with the women&#8217;s team at the Delaware State University, where they got pulled over in Georgia?&nbsp; They claimed they were subject to an unfair and unlawful search looking for drugs and whatnot.&nbsp; Do you know about that?&nbsp; Does he know about that?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; I actually don&#8217;t.&nbsp; This is the first I&#8217;m hearing of that.&nbsp; I&#8217;m happy to look into that and get back to you, but I actually don’t &#8212; have not heard that one.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wanted to see if you guys have a quick comment on the arrest of the Catholic cardinal in Hong Kong and the other activists there.&nbsp; Did you have anything on that?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Yes, I do.&nbsp; Give me one second.<br>&nbsp;<br>So, freedom of expression are critical to prosperous and secure societies. &nbsp;We call on PC- &#8212; PRC and Hong Kong authorities to cease targeting Hong Kong’s advocates and to immediately release who have been unjustly detained and charged, like the Cardinal Joseph Zen Ze-kiun and others arrested today.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karine, Senator Joe Manchin just said that he would be opposing the legislation today on the abortion vote.&nbsp; What message does it send to the country and to the nine justices that you’re going to have a bipartisan majority voting against this legislation?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; So &#8212; and you’re talking about the Women’s Health Protection Act?<br>&nbsp;<br>So, we put a statement of administration policy out, and so this is the message that we have. &nbsp;And, clearly, the urgency to protect women’s health, their fundamental right to control their reproductive choices, and the freedom of all people to build their own future has never been greater.<br>&nbsp;<br>The position of the Biden administration has been clear since day one: We will defend women’s constitutional rights recognized in Roe v. Wade &#8212; rights that have been under attack for decades and are under unprecedented threat now despite strong support from the American people.</p>



<p>It is evident that the constitutional rights protected for nearly 50 years, as Roe v. Wade, are now in severe jeopardy.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is imperative for Congress to act to adap- &#8212; to adopt statutory protections for women’s access to healthcare services and productive [reproductive] choices &#8212; productive [reproductive] choice, regardless of where they live.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Congress must further act to protect healthcare providers’ ability to provide such critical services free from unwarranted, inappropriate restrictions, and to eliminate unjustified burdens of commerce that prevent women and their families from participating fully and equally in the economic and social life of the &#8212; social life of the United States.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The protec- &#8212; the protections that Women’s Health Protection Act would ensure are essential to the health, safety, and progress of our nation.&nbsp; So that is what we put out there in support of that.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karine, just on inflation, as we’re about to land.&nbsp; I know the new numbers today show that inflation slowed somewhat, but core inflation actually jumped up about 0.6 percent.&nbsp; Are you guys concerned that even though prices may start trending down that, at the root of it all, inflation is still a real problem?<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; So, you know, we’re been clear-eyed in talking about the challenges driving inflation around the globe.&nbsp; As the President said yesterday, the first cause was the pandemic &#8212; the bottlenecks that has caused around &#8212; that has caused around the globe.&nbsp; And there’s no doubt that Putin’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine has also led to high &#8212; higher commodity prices and pain for Americans at the pump.<br>&nbsp;<br>But we know prices are too high on too many Am- &#8212; things for &#8212; on too many things for Amer- &#8212; working Americans.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>That’s why the President is using every tool we have to drive down the costs.&nbsp; That includes historic release of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, announcement this week on lowering the prices of Internet access of millions of Americans, and the President’s travel today to Illinois to speak with farmers about how we can do to lower their costs and help them produce more.&nbsp; And you’ll hear more about that from him later today.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Go ahead.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, you know, we’re starting to see, on the back of the report today, private market forecasts that are suggesting that we won&#8217;t see a significant deceleration of inflation until early next year, including all of the steps you&#8217;re taking, including the predicted path of Fed policy.&nbsp; Is that consistent with your estimates at this point?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp;&nbsp;Look, you know &#8212; I mean, I guess, more top- &#8212; topically, I would say that: You know, it&#8217;s heartening that the annual inflation cooled in April, which is what we saw. But as the President said yesterday, inflation is unacceptably high and bringing down prices is his top priority.&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#8217;s going to be our main focus.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>I leave the prediction to the Fed &#8212; Federal Reserve and other experts, but his plan is focused on lowering the cost that families face and reducing the federal &#8212; the federal deficit.&nbsp; And so, that&#8217;s going to be &#8212; that&#8217;s going to be our focus for moving forward.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The President’s executive order on cryptocurrency a few months ago &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; set out some research.&nbsp; Agencies were going to spend a few months looking at it, come back with proposals.&nbsp; That market is in significant movement right now.&nbsp; Bitcoin has lost something like more than half its value.&nbsp; So I guess the question is: Should regulators move quicker in light of the, you know, recent movement on crypto now that there are signs of, you know, systemic problems or at least a sharp plunge in the sector?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; So, just like the stock market, as you know, we don&#8217;t judge the economy by the daily movement of crypto.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>But as you know, all &#8212; as well, crypto is a highly volatile asset.&nbsp; It&#8217;s why the President signed an EO outlining the first ever whole-of-government approach to addressing the risks and opportunities of digital assets.&nbsp; Reviews of digital assets, including crypto, is underway across agencies.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>But I don&#8217;t have anything right now to preview, but that is something that we&#8217;re looking at that’s being reviewed.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You’re not planning on &#8212; for speeding it up or changing course, given the movements we&#8217;ve seen in the last couple of &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; No, I don’t &#8212; I mean, I just don’t have anything more than what I just stated.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Can I ask &#8212; on baby formula, there&#8217;s been severe shortages throughout much of the country over many weeks and months, but particularly the last couple of weeks.&nbsp; What is the administration doing?&nbsp; What can you do?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, that’s something certainly we&#8217;ve been tracking.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ensuring that &#8212; so ensuring that infant form- &#8212; formula is safe and available for families across the country is a top priority to the White House and this administration.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>We know that Abbott&#8217;s voluntary recall of infant formula products has led to some Americans being unable to access infant formula and other critical medical food supply.&nbsp; This is an urgent issue that the FDA, as you all know, and the White House is working 24/7 to address.&nbsp; They are committed to pulling every lever and are ready to making progress and getting more supply onto the market.<br>&nbsp;<br>In fact, in April, sales were about 10 percent greater than in March.&nbsp; Right now, consumers should be able to find general powdered infant formulas in stores, but we are focused on doing everything we can to ensure formula is more easily available.<br>&nbsp;<br>Just a couple of things I&#8217;ll read out really quickly &#8212; what FDA is doing.&nbsp;&nbsp;They&#8217;re working closely with industry to maximize their production capabilities by opening new lines for products in high demand, expediting FDA reviews to mo- &#8212; to more efficiently get supply out, and expanding hours of operation for manufacturers; expediting the importance [importation] of products produced aboard [abroad]; calling on retailer groups to consider placing purchase limits on some products to avoid the possibility of hoarding that could further constraint the market.<br>&nbsp;<br>And anyone who needs certain speci- &#8212; specific and metabolic formulas should consult their healthcare providers for guidance and alternatives to their current formula.<br>&nbsp;<br>I can take one right now.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karine &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Yeah.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; who’s running point on the formula issue at the White House?&nbsp; You mentioned the White House is involved.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; I mean, I &#8212; at the White House, I don&#8217;t &#8212; I don’t know.&nbsp; I can find out for you and get you a person who&#8217;s running point.&nbsp; But I don&#8217;t have a (inaudible).<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You got time for one on Putin?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Yeah.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just on the DNI’s testimony.&nbsp; She said Putin might take drastic means, escalatory optio- &#8212; military options and might view losing as an existential threat.&nbsp; How does that assessment change how you guys are dealing with the situation over there?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; I mean &#8212; so, look, it’s clear that Putin has not been able to accomplish the objectives he’s laid out before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.&nbsp; Russia has failed to overthrow the Ukrainian government.&nbsp; They lost the Battle of &#8212; for Kyiv and were forced to retreat and re- &#8212; refocus elsewhere.&nbsp; And they have failed to divide the West.<br>&nbsp;<br>Look, the &#8212; you know, when it comes to &#8212; you know, you hear the question about diplomacy.&nbsp; Diplomacy is the only way to end this conflict, but Russia has shown no signs that they are willing to seriously engage in negotiations.&nbsp; So, we are focused on strengthening Ukraine’s hand as possible on the battlefields so that when the time comes, they have as much leverage as possible at the negotiation table.<br>&nbsp;<br>But, again, as we’ve said over and over again, this is &#8212; this is Russia’s war.&nbsp; They &#8212; they created this war.&nbsp; They invaded Ukraine in a brutal way.&nbsp; And so, what Ukraine is doing is they are defending themselves and their democracy.&nbsp; So, this is for Russia to end this war.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Karine.<br>&nbsp;<br>12:08 P.M. EDT</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>This pandemic has spotlighted the critical role and bravery of health and care workers. That’s why I’ve asked my Administration to develop a global health workforce plan, to accelerate our contributions to the Sustainable Development Agenda and investments in health and care workers.</em></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>President Joseph R. Biden, April 7, 2022</em></p>



<p>Strategic and sustained investments in the global health workforce are key to catalyzing the U.S. Government’s efforts to achieve the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda. The COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated the estimated global shortage of 18 million health workers by 2030.  With growing health demands from new and emerging pathogens, aging populations, climate shocks, and increasing conflict and migration, the ever-increasing demand for health workers needs greater coordinated attention and action. A comprehensive, trained, protected, well-equipped, and supported workforce is foundational to expanding equitable access to public health services and health care across the globe.  Investments in health workers not only improve health outcomes, they create jobs and career pathways and economic development by strengthening human capital as part of the care economy.  Funding advancements for the health workforce will accelerate ending the COVID-19 pandemic, stimulate economic recovery, and support critical components of President Biden’s values-driven global infrastructure initiative announced at the 2021 G7 Summit by strengthening global health systems, expanding national and regional capacity, including manufacturing of essential medical products.  These investments will also build on commitments made by global partners at the 2nd Global COVID-19 Summit co-hosted by the United States to accelerate combatting COVID-19 and advancing future preparedness.<br><br>Currently, U.S. Government programs such as the U.S. President&#8217;s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), the U.S. President’s Malaria Initiative (PMI), and U.S. bilateral global health security partnerships in support of the Global Health Security Agenda, contribute approximately $1.56 billion annually to support the health workforce across the globe. Further, the President’s Fiscal Year (FY) 2023 Budget prioritizes advancing investments across health programs to strengthen health systems and the global health workforce and support. Notably, the President’s Budget includes an additional $1 billion for this new Global Health Worker Initiative to support and protect the global health workforce as part of the Administration’s increased prioritization and investments in health workforce. This funding, if provided by Congress, would be directed through the U.S. Department of State and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and coordinated with others in the U.S. government. <br><br>The Global Health Worker Initiative expands and defines &#8220;health workers&#8221; broadly to include a multidisciplinary workforce including clinicians, community health and care workers, and public health professionals. It provides a framework to guide and organize the U.S. Government’s investments and strengthen coordination with key partners including G7 and G20 countries, multilateral and regional organizations, and the private sector. While global in focus, this effort complements President Biden’s efforts to support the domestic health workforce.<br><br>From the beginning of the Biden-Harris Administration, the United States has demonstrated renewed leadership in global health through action and smart, targeted investments. The United States will continue to advance global health priorities and build upon existing efforts aligned to the following four pillars of focus under the Global Health Worker Initiative:<br><br><strong>PROTECTING HEALTH WORKERS</strong><br><br>Through global health programs, the U.S Government will advance work to ensure health workers across facilities and communities have prioritized access to vaccinations [and treatment], personal protective equipment (PPE), and services to support their physical and mental health and well-being and better protection and safeguards from violence and attacks on health facilities, including in conflict and humanitarian settings.   </p>



<ul><li><strong>Accelerate coordinated efforts to protect health workers fighting COVID-19.</strong>&nbsp;The COVID-19 Global Action Plan (GAP), announced by Secretary Blinken on February 14, 2022, has six lines of effort to help end the acute phase of the pandemic, including a dedicated effort specifically to support health workers. The GAP aims to galvanize partner countries and international organizations to decrease risks posed by COVID-19 by increasing vaccine and treatment availability, encouraging vaccine uptake, addressing workplace safety, and health worker training.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></li><li><strong>Provide tools and resources for health workers responding to COVID-19 while ensuring delivery of primary health services.</strong>&nbsp;Ongoing U.S. Government programming is adapting to account for the pandemic. For example, PMI trains health workers to efficiently and effectively diagnose and treat malaria in the context of COVID-19, including educating patients to avoid risk of transmission and where to access COVID-19 and malaria treatment services.&nbsp;&nbsp;PEPFAR-funded health workers have ensured delivery of essential HIV prevention and treatment services while responding to the pandemic, by leveraging over 100,000 health workers to support COVID-19 needs across more than 40 countries. PEPFAR is also focused on reducing the risk of health worker burnout and longer-term mental health effects by providing support, including time off for self-care, recuperation, and family’s needs; and advancing access to mental health services. Additionally, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), is working to improve local and regional healthcare personnel safety and infection prevention and control in more than 15 countries across four continents. These efforts involve healthcare worker surveillance to quickly detect infections; facility-based comprehensive safety assessments and quality improvement initiatives; infectious disease detection and response; training, supervision, and regional communities of practice; and technical engagement with Ministries of Health to ensure implementation consistent with global norms.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></li><li><strong>Supporting health workers in conflict settings.</strong>&nbsp;In Ukraine, USAID is supporting the Ministry of Health and National Health Service of Ukraine to develop an incentive system to attract, retain, and equitably distribute health care workers in war-impacted regions, using both financial and non-financial incentives so that local authorities will be better able to hire health care workers to fill critical shortages.&nbsp;&nbsp;To address the significant mental health strains of COVID-19 and the subsequent Russian invasion, USAID is also supporting the scale-up of mental health counseling services for conflict-affected populations, including health workers.</li></ul>



<p><strong><br>EXPAND THE GLOBAL HEALTH WORKFORCE AND ACCELERATE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT</strong><br><br>The U.S Government will continue efforts to create career pathways and expand paid employment opportunities for a more diverse and gender equitable workforce in the public and private health sectors, better equipping healthcare and community health workers, to meet local population health needs including provision of patient-centered services at the primary health care level. These efforts will further build local and regional institutional capacity to manage and support a global health workforce that is adequately prepared and aligned to respond to routine and emergency surge capacity needs.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><strong>Promote fair and timely pay for all health workers.</strong>&nbsp;Through our global health programs, including PEPFAR and PMI, we will continue to promote fair and timely compensation for health workers.&nbsp;&nbsp;PEPFAR will continue to align its financial support for over 330,000 health workers, a $1 billion annual investment, helping achieve HIV epidemic control in over 40 countries. Similarly, PMI recently updated their policies to allow the use of PMI funds to provide salaries or stipends to community health workers in settings where payment to them is in line with government policy.&nbsp;<br></li><li><strong>Develop a multidisciplinary Global Health Security workforce.</strong>&nbsp;Achieving global health security requires a multi-sectoral approach that incorporates an understanding of the linkages among human, animal, and environmental health– a “One Health” approach. As part of the U.S. Government’s Global Health Security programs, USAID is investing up to $85 million over five years to create a “next generation” health workforce. In 2021, USAID worked with more than 110 universities in 17 countries across Africa and Southeast Asia to train more than 18,000 current and future health workers for more effective disease surveillance and control. CDC has partnered with five leading international organizations to develop the Global Laboratory Leadership Programme (GLLP).&nbsp;&nbsp;The GLLP is a comprehensive One Health-based training program for human and animal health laboratories. The GLLP is currently implemented in over 20 countries in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. In addition, the CDC Field Epidemiology Training Program (FETP) is recognized worldwide as an effective means to strengthen countries’ capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to public health threats through enhanced surveillance, epidemiology, and outbreak response functions. CDC works with partner countries to establish FETPs and to train epidemiologists across all levels of a country’s health system. To date, FETP has been implemented in more than 80 countries around the globe with more than 20,000 graduates with many FETP graduates becoming leaders and managers in&nbsp;&nbsp;Ministries of Health or national public health institutes.&nbsp;&nbsp;These activities accelerate progress of the United States Global Health Security Strategy, and will continue to help our partners build country-level capacities in line with their World Health Organization&nbsp;&nbsp;Joint External Evaluations, National Action Plans for Health Security, and other tools the strengthen compliance with the International Health Regulations (IHR 2005).<br></li><li><strong>Collaborate with local partners and country governments to build a sustainable health workforce.</strong>&nbsp;As part of localization efforts, USAID is advancing work with local partners to strengthen human resources planning, management, and oversight to overcome health worker shortfalls. Increasing direct partnerships with host country government entities is essential to improving sustainability of health systems. For example, USAID, through a $10 million Government-to-Government (G2G) investment, is working with the Government of Malawi to fill critical health workforce financing gaps and strengthen health systems.&nbsp;&nbsp;Part of the Malawi G2G programming agreement includes a phased transition of these health workforces to Malawi Government financing, with immediate provision of critical health services while building systems to sustain those health workers beyond USAID funding.<br>&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Optimize the health workers to support global COVID-19 vaccination efforts.</strong>&nbsp;The Initiative for Global Vaccine Access (Global VAX), a whole-of-government effort to turn vaccines in vials into vaccinations in arms around the world, builds on existing U.S. Government efforts with total cumulative commitments of more than $1.7 billion, helping over 100 countries prepare to receive and administer COVID-19 vaccines with surge funding and support to 11 countries (Angola, Côte d’Ivoire, Eswatini, Ghana, Lesotho, Nigeria, Senegal, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia). Through Global VAX, the U.S. Government is providing financial and technical assistance to engage and train additional health workers for vaccination efforts, including vaccine delivery, community engagement, record keeping, local micro-planning, and cold chain maintenance.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p><strong>ADVANCE EQUITY AND INCLUSION</strong><br><br>President Biden’s commitment to advancing equity and inclusion goes beyond our borders. The U.S Government will carry forward his commitment globally to address numerous barriers, including gender, ethnic/racial, geographic, age, and others, particularly among the community health workforce, to build a more diverse cohort of health worker graduates and leaders that reflects inclusivity, is better-equipped to serve local populations and provide patient-centered care including at the primary health care level.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Addressing the gender gap.</strong>&nbsp;Recognizing that women represent 70 percent of the global health workforce, the U.S. Government is increasing waged employment opportunities and leadership opportunities for women in the health workforce in alignment with the U.S. Government’s first-ever National Strategy on Gender Equity and Equality with commitment to advance the full participation of all people- including women and girls- in the United States and around the world,&nbsp;&nbsp;focus on building the global care economy and care infrastructure, and improve economic security and accelerate economic growth. This includes USAID’s development of recruitment strategies for employment of at-risk, vulnerable youth and women; partnership with the private sector; and supporting the professionalization of community health workers.&nbsp;&nbsp;PEPFAR has invested more than $1.3 billion supporting nearly 2.5 million adolescent girls and young women through the Determined, Resilient, Empowered, AIDS-free, Mentored and Safe (DREAMS) program in the last five years. The partnership supports adolescent girls and young women with socioeconomic opportunities, including employment in the health sector, as part of efforts aimed at reducing rates of HIV among adolescent girls and young women in the highest HIV burden countries.<br></li><li><strong>Health workers reflect the populations they serve</strong>. It is critical that countries recruit and retain a diverse health workforce to help meet the needs of those populations.&nbsp;&nbsp;PEPFAR has partnered with Historically Black Colleges and Universities through Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), at HHS, to provide opportunities for adolescent girls and young women, who are at high risk for early sexual debut and HIV, to receive training as community health workers and be employed to provide essential health services to their home communities in areas where there are critical shortages of health care workers. This work has started in Malawi.<br></li><li><strong>Diversifying the global health research workforce.</strong>&nbsp;The National Institutes of Health (NIH), part of HHS, is the largest funder of health research in the world, and is building an inclusive, diverse, and global scientific workforce conducting research in Federal government laboratories. In addition, the NIH Fogarty International Center (FIC) has an exclusive international mission and responsibility for foreign research coordination that includes a focus on building research capacity in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) by providing training and research support through a variety of programs to address emerging global health needs. Much of FIC’s resources are dedicated to building research capacity in LMICs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1989, more than 7,500 individuals from over 130 countries have trained through FIC programs.<br></li><li><strong>Reaching rural and remote populations</strong>. Across the globe, Peace Corps staff and Volunteers continue to work alongside existing health service providers and community health workers in difficult to reach rural and “last mile” communities and provide training of health workers to support vaccination, community engagement, disease prevention measures, surveillance activities, referral facilitation, and social and behavioral change to promote delivery of improved quality health services delivery.<br></li></ul>



<p><strong>DRIVE AND INVEST IN TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENTS AND INNOVATION</strong><br><br>The U.S Government will further harness innovation and expand digital technologies that equip health workers with the ability to provide more efficient, quality-integrated service delivery, including telehealth services that can extend the reach of health services from facilities and into communities, including the most marginalized populations. The use of digital platforms will be expanded to improve the availability and routine use of quality health workforce data to inform decisions about workforce planning and operations, including performance management and consistent remuneration, and also expand the use of digital tools.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><strong>Digital health as a tool to advance primary health care.</strong>&nbsp;USAID’s Vision for Action in Digital Health and Vision for Health System Strengthening 2030 together lay out a plan for how USAID can increase the responsible use of digital technologies to accelerate programming in the health sector in strategic coordination with partner countries. USAID is investing in integrated digital platforms to advance patient-centered care and support front-line health workers. Current investments include working to advance broad-based functionality and guide improvement of standardized digital health tools and systems used to support health workers in providing a set of essential patient-centered primary health care services.&nbsp;<br></li><li><strong>Digital systems provide real time data to health workers.&nbsp;</strong>PMI supports digital tools in partner countries to equip health workers with real-time data. PMI improves evidence-based decision making by strengthening data collection, management, analysis, and utilization at all levels of the health care delivery system. PMI has invested $8.5 million in Rwanda, Senegal, and Burkina Faso to strengthen integrated and equitable care by equipping community health workers with tools needed to be better-connected to other health workers, bring care to unreached populations, and improve access to near real-time data.<br></li><li><strong>Technology to support data for decision making.&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;PEPFAR invests nearly $22 million annually to support the development and use of human resource information systems and digital health platforms. These investments provide data for better understanding of the available health workforce and health worker utilization and an additional modality to ensure continuity of safe provision of services. These investments proved invaluable during the COVID-19 pandemic with the employment of modified service delivery models including telehealth service.</li></ul>

<p>While it is heartening to see that annual inflation moderated in April, the fact remains that inflation is unacceptably high.&nbsp;As I said yesterday, inflation is a challenge for families across the country and bringing it down is my top economic priority.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This starts with the Federal Reserve, which plays a primary role in fighting inflation in our country. I thank the Senate for confirming Dr. Lisa Cook to the Board of Governors last night, and urge the Senate to confirm my remaining nominees without delay. While I will never interfere with the Fed’s independence, I believe we have built a strong economy and a strong labor market, and I agree with what Chairman Powell said last week that the number one threat to that strength – is inflation. I am confident the Fed will do its job with that in mind. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Beyond the Fed, my inflation plan is focused on lowering the costs that families face and lowering the federal deficit. Already this week, my Administration has announced new steps in partnership with the private sector to lower the price of high speed internet for tens of millions of Americans. And, the Congressional Budget Office reported that the federal budget deficit in the first seven months of this fiscal year fell by $1.5 trillion—putting us on track for the most deficit reduction in any year on record. The CBO also confirmed that the budget deficit so far this year is lower than it was during the same period in 2019, before the pandemic began. &nbsp;Today, I am traveling to Illinois to speak with farmers about more we can do to lower their costs and help them&nbsp;produce more, lowering the price of food for Americans and around the world. All of this is progress, but the&nbsp;fight against global supply chain issues related to the pandemic and Putin’s price hike will continue every day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Congressional Republicans talk about inflation, but their only plan is to raise taxes on working families, taking even more money out of their pockets.&nbsp; If they are serious about inflation, they should send me the bipartisan innovation bill to bolster our supply chains and make more in America, along with legislation that cuts costs and the cuts the deficit, reducing families’ prescription drug and utility bills and restoring fairness to our tax code. We’ve made enormous progress in getting our economy back on track, and these measures would help us sustain this progress and bring prices down for families.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>The White House announces private sector commitments in response to the call to action from President Biden and First Lady Jill Biden on cancer screening. These new actions and collaborations mark progress toward the Cancer Moonshot goal to decrease the death rate from cancer by at least 50 percent over the next 25 years. </em></p>



<p>Just under 100 days ago, President Biden reignited the Cancer Moonshot with renewed White House leadership and new ambitious goals: to reduce the death rate from cancer by at least 50 percent over the next 25 years, and improve the experience of people and their families living with and surviving cancer – and, by doing this and more, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/02/02/fact-sheet-president-biden-reignites-cancer-moonshot-to-end-cancer-as-we-know-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">end cancer as we know it today</a>.</p>



<p>In March, in his first State of the Union Address, President Biden highlighted the Cancer Moonshot as part of his Unity Agenda for the nation. The White House convened the Cancer Cabinet to establish a prioritized agenda across government including the development of new interagency programs and collaborations and announced&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/news-updates/2022/03/17/fact-sheet-white-house-announces-initial-steps-for-reignited-cancer-moonshot/">initial steps for the Cancer Moonshot</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last week, Cancer Cabinet agencies and departments hosted a virtual series of 10 roundtable discussions,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/cancermoonshot/events-and-webinars/past-events/">Cancer Moonshot Community Conversations</a>, to inform and advance Cancer Moonshot priorities and the White House released a new webpage featuring the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/cancermoonshot/yourstories/">stories of people</a>&nbsp;living with cancer, survivors, and caregivers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, leaders from the patient and caregiver community, foundations, non-profits, companies, health care providers, and others will come together at the White House and virtually to strategize how we can each act to make progress on the seven pillars of how we know cancer today. The goal is to identify impactful steps to: (1) improve cancer screening; (2) enhance prevention; (3) address inequities; (4) target effective treatments to patients; (5) develop approaches for deadly and rare cancers, including childhood cancers; (6) support patients, survivors, and caregivers; and (7) learn more from people living with cancer.</p>



<p>As part of the reignited Cancer Moonshot, the President and First Lady announced a call to action on cancer screening to jumpstart progress on the nearly 10 million screenings in the United States that were missed as a result of the pandemic, and to work to ensure that all Americans equitably benefit from the tools we have to prevent, detect, and diagnose cancer. The following announcements comprise an initial response to that call to action.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, this includes efforts to reduce disparities in access to cancer screening by bringing: high-quality care to New York City’s Harlem, Washington, DC, and three other cities; mobile lung cancer screening to communities in Appalachia and rural parts of Tennessee, Georgia, and Alabama; support from screening through care to women in South Florida; and bilingual navigation services to reach Latinas in Baltimore and Washington, DC. These commitments also include business leaders around Columbus, Ohio committing to support employees with the time and resources needed to get their recommended cancer screenings and national efforts that will reach communities from coast to coast with knowledge, support, and access to cancer early detection.</p>

<p><strong><u>Private sector actions in response to cancer screening call to action:</u></strong></p>



<p><strong><u>Bringing Cancer Screening to More Communities&nbsp;</u></strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>The Association of Community Cancer Centers (ACCC) and AstraZeneca Join Efforts to Create the “Rural Appalachian Lung Cancer Screening Initiative.”</strong>&nbsp;The ACCC and AstraZeneca are launching a new partnership to develop and implement person-centered and sustainable approaches to increase lung cancer screening in rural America through the “Rural Appalachian Lung Cancer Screening Initiative.”&nbsp;As part of an initial $1.3 million investment, the Initiative will collect best practices and develop screening resources that will be shared with ACCC pilot sites with the potential to engage up to 30 percent more eligible individuals in the first five years.&nbsp;Upon project completion, data will be shared with all 2,100 ACCC cancer programs and practices nationwide.&nbsp;The United States has made great strides in reducing lung cancer incidence and mortality over the last five years. In Appalachia, however, driven, in part, by increased rates of tobacco use, cancer mortality is 10 percent higher than the national rate and, for rural Appalachian counties, cancer mortality is 15 percent higher than the region’s metro counties.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>ACCC will build on its portfolio of resources and tools for health care providers, including “Fostering Excellence in Care and Outcomes in Patients with Stage III and IV NSCLC,” &#8220;Improving Care Coordination: A Model for Lung Cancer Patients on Medicaid,” and “Understanding &amp; Improving Lung Cancer Treatment in Asian Americans &amp; Pacific Islanders in the Community Setting.” AstraZeneca convened the Lung Ambition Alliance (LAA) in 2019 with key partners, and is focused on accelerating advances in lung cancer survival and improving patient outcomes, with the goal of eliminating lung cancer as a cause of death. The LAA’s initial goal is to double the five-year survival rate for lung cancer.&nbsp;<br></li><li><strong>Nonprofits Family Reach and Nueva Vida Collaborate to Provide Community Navigation and Financial Support for Latinas Facing Breast Cancer:</strong>&nbsp;Nueva Vida, a support network for Latinas with &#8212; or at risk of &#8212; cancer, is partnering with Family Reach, a national nonprofit removing financial barriers to cancer treatment, to provide continuous support to 800 additional Latinas in the Washington, D.C. and Baltimore metro areas during breast cancer screening and treatment. Latinas face unique and increasing challenges accessing and adhering to breast cancer screening and treatment due to psychosocial, logistical, financial, and systemic barriers.&nbsp;<br><br>Nueva Vida addresses the unmet needs of Latinas through free culturally-competent services. Bilingual/bicultural patient navigators attend appointments to ensure timely delivery of diagnostic and treatment services, provide language and clinical interpretation, and facilitate financial support for medications and basic needs. Their Navigators build trusting, long-term relationships with clients to ensure critical needs are met and that patients can effectively plan for and adhere to treatment.&nbsp;<br><br>Family Reach offers comprehensive financial services that reduce patients’ financial distress and improve access to care during treatment, regardless of immigration status. Nueva Vida’s Navigators will leverage Family Reach’s Financial Treatment Program to deliver financial tools that meet the unique needs of each family, ensuring they can both stay on treatment and keep their families housed and fed.&nbsp;<br></li><li><strong>GO2 Foundation for Lung Cancer Expands Mobile Screening to At-Risk Communities</strong>: The GO2 Foundation for Lung Cancer, in partnership with Catholic Health Initiatives Memorial, Chattanooga, Tennessee, a GO2&nbsp;Foundation for Lung Cancer Center of Excellence (COE), and with support from AstraZeneca, Bristol Myers Squibb, Merck, and a private funder, is bringing lung cancer screenings to at-risk, rural residents across southeast Tennessee and northern Georgia. The Breathe Easy mobile screening program currently provides more than 1,000 lung cancer screenings annually, primarily to those who are uninsured and those with public insurance. Expansion of the Breathe Easy program will extend mobile lung cancer screening further south in Georgia and into Alabama where, in part, due to higher than the national average rates of tobacco use, there are over 20,000 individuals at risk for lung cancer and eligible for lung cancer screening but currently without ready access to these services.&nbsp;An initial $1 million investment supporting the launch of this new mobile screening unit is estimated to provide services for 10 years, screening as many as 3,000 people per year.<br></li><li><strong>Promise Fund of Florida Doubles Down on Model to Improve Women’s Health</strong>:<br>The Promise Fund of Florida plans to double its reach in 2022 – to serve more than 30,000 women – with a Continuum of Care model that supports women in South Florida from screening through care for breast and cervical cancer. The Promise Fund of Florida co-locates a Women’s Health Center offering mammography and ultrasound services at a federally-qualified health center. In one example, FoundCare in West Palm Beach, this approach led to screening rates jumping from 10% to 57%, demonstrating that women are more likely to obtain screenings when they are familiar with their provider organization, have been connected to financial assistance by a navigator, and are able to receive multiple services in one day, which reduces the associated barriers of having to secure rides to appointments and requesting additional time off from work.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></li><li><strong>Ralph Lauren Corporate Foundation (RLCF) Commits $25 million to Improve Equity in Cancer Prevention, Screening, and Care.</strong>&nbsp;In its single largest funding commitment to date, the RLCF is pledging $25 million to five cancer care and prevention programs benefiting Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, and three yet-to-be-named additional National Cancer Institute-designated centers focused on reducing disparities in cancer care in underserved communities. The programs will provide increased screenings, early diagnosis, and treatment and patient navigation services, while improving access to high-quality care for those most in need.&nbsp;<br><br>As part of its commitment, the RLCF will build on its support of the Memorial Sloan Kettering (MSK) Ralph Lauren Center in Harlem, New York.&nbsp;&nbsp;In Washington D.C., the Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center will newly establish the Ralph Lauren Center for Cancer Prevention. The renamed and reimagined center will build on the existing practices of the Capital Breast Care Center and expand access to diagnostic and navigation services for the District’s most underserved populations, focusing on breast, colorectal, lung, and prostate cancer, the area’s four most prevalent types of cancers. Going forward, RLCF will collaborate with Conquer Cancer®, the ASCO Foundation, to identify three additional grant recipients selected based on their National Cancer Institute-designation and demonstrated commitment to overcoming health disparities for communities in need.</li></ul>



<p><strong><u>Expanding Messaging and Support for Cancer Early Detection&nbsp;</u></strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>American Cancer Society (ACS) Launches National Platforms on Cervical and Breast Cancer</strong>: ACS will initiate two new national roundtables in 2022 – one focused on cervical cancer, the other on breast cancer – to bring together leading organizations and experts to drive progress and improve the lives of people living with cancer as well as their families. ACS has established this convening model as an effective structure for collaboration and impact and this approach aligns with the President&#8217;s Cancer Panel recently-released&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2022/cancer-screening-presidents-cancer-panel-report">report on cancer screening</a>. ACS is also pursuing several additional initiatives aimed at ensuring greater equity in cancer screening and early detection, including launching a learning collaborative with six community health centers across the country to address medical mistrust related to colorectal cancer screening. Finally, ACS&#8217;s advocacy affiliate, the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network (ACS CAN), will advocate for robust and sustained funding for breast and cervical cancer early detection programs at the state and federal level to ensure those who are uninsured and underinsured have access to potentially lifesaving screenings and treatment once cancer is detected.<br></li><li><strong>Cancer Support Community (CSC) Creates Pledge and Resources to Promote Urgency Around Cancer Screening.&nbsp;</strong>CSC is launching a new social media campaign to encourage people to take a pledge to prioritize getting cancer screening and urging their friends and family to do the same. They expect to reach more than 150,000 people through email and social media efforts and expect thousands to come to the landing page to support the pledge and/or become more informed about screenings. CSC will provide resources to help people learn more about which routine screenings are currently available and recommended. Additionally, since anxiety and depression are not only common in people impacted by cancer, but often prevents people from even seeking cancer screening, these resources will include support and navigation services provided along the entire cancer continuum, from before screening, to waiting for test results, and through diagnosis, treatment, and survivorship. This will include a toll-free Cancer Support Helpline and a network of 175 locations across the United States, including CSC and Gilda&#8217;s Club centers, in addition to healthcare partnerships.<br></li><li><strong>Coalition of Companies Step Up to Help Employees Access Recommended Cancer Screenings</strong>: Pelotonia, a non-profit cancer research organization and The Columbus Partnership, a membership organization that convenes CEOs from some of Central Ohio’s largest employers around opportunities to advance economic development and prosperity, are committed to developing a platform whereby employers access and adopt recommended cancer health education and screening materials to better the health of their workforces – an effort that will initially reach more than 250,000 employees. These employers will distribute cancer prevention and screening education materials, host on-site screening opportunities, and offer flexible time off to ensure their employees can take part in recommended cancer screenings, as a commitment to the health of their workforce.&nbsp;<br></li><li><strong>Fight Colorectal Cancer (Fight CRC) Leads Renewed Push for Improved Screening Access at No Cost to Patient:</strong>&nbsp;Fight CRC will build on the Administration&#8217;s recent guidance to commercial insurance plans that they must cover colonoscopy without out-of-pocket costs following an abnormal non-invasive colorectal cancer screening test. Fight CRC is working through its Catalyst State-by-State Advocacy Program to build on its state-level policy work to remove cost barriers to screening and help ensure that the Administration&#8217;s guidance is effectively and equitably implemented.<br><br>Additionally, Fight CRC launched its Path to a Cure report, a professional, multidisciplinary publication, which seeks to summarize and communicate a plan for the colorectal cancer community to rally around: pushing forward critical areas of research; care for patients; and policy, with prevention and early detection as priority areas. Through convening key stakeholders, identifying gaps and opportunities in both research and public policy, Fight CRC is committing to identifying and implementing strategies to increase access to colorectal cancer screening in all communities as part of its Path to a Cure.<br></li><li><strong>Cancer Stage Shifting Initiative Launched by the National Minority Quality Forum (NMQF) to Reach Millions</strong>: NMQF is announcing a multi-sponsored Cancer Stage Shifting Initiative (CSSI) guided by a board of scientific and community thought leaders. CSSI’s mission is to move from late stage to early-stage diagnosis and treatment of cancer in minority populations, with a special, but not exclusive, focus on people living with colorectal cancer. NMQF expects to reach an audience of more than 11 million patients, clinicians and other stakeholders monthly through its collaborations in advocacy and policy, social media communication, clinical research in underserved communities, representative data and quality improvement and community engagement.&nbsp;&nbsp;The initiative will have a clear focus on equity and is expected to improve cancer care for all. Stage shifting will require system changes brought on by a coordinated effort that involves patients, caregivers, families and all stakeholders in the oncology community and beyond, advocating for, educating and communicating about earlier detection and treatment of cancer among underserved populations.&nbsp;<br></li><li><strong>Philips and RadNet Partner to Improve Cancer Screening Reach and Accuracy:&nbsp;</strong>Philips, a global leader in health technology, and RadNet, the largest owner of outpatient imaging centers in the United States, are collaborating to deploy and develop new solutions that can improve the early detection, diagnosis, and treatment of cancer. RadNet will be using Philips solutions for workflow management and patient engagement in their lung cancer screening programs to increase the impact of patient outreach efforts, efficiently scale lung cancer screening workflow and programs, and get more at-risk people screened for lung cancer. Moreover, RadNet is using Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled technologies to improve detection and characterization of cancer at earlier stages, preventing false positive findings and reducing unnecessary patient burden, which can lead to better outcomes. Through RadNet’s network of imaging centers and educational outreach programs reaching 15 million Americans each year, many of whom are located in densely-populated, ethnically-diverse communities with at-risk populations, Philips and RadNet are striving for improved education, earlier detection, and more engaged participants, which could yield improved cancer outcomes for all Americans.</li></ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>Pandemic-related supply chain disruptions and Putin’s Price Hike are increasing the price of food for working families here at home and leading to shortages of food in countries across the globe. Today, President Biden will visit a family farm to announce actions his administration is taking to support American farmers, reduce food prices, and feed the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Putin’s unjustified invasion of Ukraine has cut off a critical source of wheat, corn, barley, oilseeds, and cooking oil. It has also disrupted global supply chains for fertilizer, which farmers depend on to maximize yields. These and other actions, combined with the ongoing pandemic-related disruptions to global supply chains, have put pressure on food prices, with global food prices increasing nearly 13 percent following Putin’s invasion.</p>



<p>America’s farmers are the breadbasket of democracy and are already playing a critical role in the fight against Putin’s Price Hike. During President Biden’s first year in office, American agricultural exports shattered all previous records, reaching a combined $177 billion, generating an estimated $378 billion in total economic output, and supporting 1.3 million jobs here in the United States.</p>



<p>Last month, the President mobilized American farmers to fuel America when he announced that his Administration would allow E15 gasoline—gasoline that uses a 15 percent ethanol blend—to be sold this summer. Today, the President is announcing new actions to give farmers the tools and resources they need to boost production, lower food prices and feed the world. As the world’s second largest exporter of wheat and soybeans, these actions will help grow new markets for American-grown food, supporting jobs in rural communities across America. Specifically, the Biden-Harris Administration will:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Increase the number of counties eligible for double cropping insurance.</strong> Double cropping allows farmers to plant a second crop on the same land in the same year, helping boost production without relying on farmers to substitute crops or cultivate new land. But it is not free from risk and some farmers who practice double cropping cannot obtain crop insurance.  The Biden-Harris Administration is seeking to expand insurance for double cropping to as many as 681 additional counties, bringing the total number of counties where this practice qualifies for crop insurance to as many as 1,935, so more American farmers have the financial security they need to start or expand double cropping. <br></li><li><strong>Cut costs for farmers by increasing technical assistance for technology-driven “precision agriculture” and other nutrient management tools. </strong>Precision agriculture is a farm management system that allows farmers to use technology to target application of inputs to soil and plant needs, resulting in less fertilizer usage without reducing yields, saving farmers money over time and extending the usefulness of critical products in short supply worldwide. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has planning and cost sharing assistance programs available to help American farmers with nutrient management. The Biden-Harris Administration is working to boost outreach to farmers, streamline the application process, and prioritize application approvals to expand access to these critical programs. <br></li><li><strong>Double funding for domestic fertilizer production. </strong>Fertilizer prices have more than doubled since last year, due in part to supply chain disruptions created and exacerbated by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, including rising energy costs. Today, President Biden is announcing that he is doubling his initial $250 million investment in domestic fertilizer production to $500 million to lower costs and boost availability for farmers, so they can obtain the inputs they need at prices they can afford to maximize yields. </li></ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is making a once-in-a-generation investment in America’s infrastructure and competitiveness that will create good-paying union jobs, grow our economy, invest in communities, combat climate change, and help lower costs for families.<br><br>To make the most of these historic investments and ensure infrastructure projects are delivered on time and on budget, the Biden-Harris Administration is releasing a new <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Biden-Harris-Permitting-Action-Plan.pdf">Permitting Action Plan</a> to strengthen and accelerate Federal permitting and environmental reviews by fully leveraging existing permitting authorities, as well as new provisions in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.<br><br>The Action Plan outlines the Administration’s strategy for ensuring that Federal environmental reviews and permitting processes are effective, efficient, and transparent, guided by the best available science to promote positive environmental and community outcomes, and shaped by early and meaningful public engagement. Taken together, these new steps will help strengthen supply chains, lower costs for families, grow our clean energy economy, revitalize communities across the country, support good-paying jobs, and deliver infrastructure investments on task, on time, and on budget without unnecessary bureaucratic delay.&nbsp;<br><br>Long overdue improvements to our nation’s ports, airports, rail, and roads will help ease inflationary pressures, create conditions for businesses to thrive, and strengthen supply chains – which will ultimately lower costs for families. Building new clean energy generation and transmission projects will improve access to affordable clean energy that powers homes and businesses at lower costs. Responsible and sustainable domestic sourcing of critical minerals and materials will power our clean energy economy and reduce reliance on unreliable foreign supply chains. And delivering clean residential water supplies, high-speed internet, healthy forests and open space to all Americans, especially those historically underserved, is critical to make us stronger.<br><br>The Action Plan is the latest example of the Administration taking action to swiftly deliver the benefits of infrastructure investment to the American people through well-designed projects that support the President’s ambitious climate and clean energy goals. Putting the Action Plan into place will result in better permitting outcomes, enhanced predictability for project sponsors, and increased accountability across Federal agencies to execute efficiently and effectively.<br><br>The Permitting Action Plan is built on five key elements that will help ensure the timely and effective delivery of crucial upgrades to America’s infrastructure.<br><br><strong><em>Accelerating Smart Permitting through Early Cross-Agency Coordination</em></strong></p>



<p>Ensuring early coordination and effective communication across Federal agencies is critical for moving infrastructure projects forward efficiently and on-time. Under the Permitting Action Plan, the Administration will:</p>



<ul><li>Leverage the interagency Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council’s expanded authorities under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to improve coordination among agencies, help avoid and resolve potential conflicts and bottlenecks, identify and share best practices, and accelerate information sharing and troubleshooting;<br></li><li>Convene sector-specific teams of experts to facilitate interagency coordination on siting, permitting, supply chain, and related issues, and promote efficient and timely reviews;<br></li><li>Leverage the Department of Transportation’s Interagency Infrastructure Permitting Improvement Center to help facilitate environmental review and permitting for Bipartisan Infrastructure Law-funded transportation projects by developing guidance, sharing best practices, coordinating reviews, tracking project milestones and outcomes, and exploring innovative approaches;<br></li><li>Develop and prepare new approaches to permitting and environmental review that help address common issues, eliminate duplication, and site and design projects in a way that reduces resource conflicts and incorporates a climate-smart approach; and<br></li><li>Work to reform outdated permitting laws and regulations, such as the Mining Law of 1872, to establish stronger environmental, sustainability, safety, Tribal consultation, and community engagement standards.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p><strong><em>Establishing Clear Timeline Goals and Tracking Key Project Information</em></strong><br><br>Communities and project proponents all benefit from having clear information about the schedules, key milestones and deadlines, and public comment opportunities for the environmental review and permitting of major projects. Timeline goals and up-to-date information increase accountability, encourage efficiency, enable greater public participation in project decisions, and build greater trust in government. Under the Permitting Action Plan, agencies will:</p>



<ul><li>Create permitting schedules with clear timeline goals that are both ambitious and realistic, contain relevant milestones, and meet all requirements in applicable law to complete environmental review and permitting in a sound and timely manner;<br></li><li>Increase transparency and accountability by tracking key project information, including timetables and milestones, on the <a href="https://www.permits.performance.gov/">Federal Permitting Dashboard</a>; and<br></li><li>Identify the lead Federal agency that will be responsible for working with other agencies in the permitting processes to develop and implement coordination plans, interagency agreements, or other tools designed to ensure sustained and effective coordination and accountability.</li></ul>



<p><strong><em>Engaging in Early and Meaningful Outreach with States, Tribal Nations, Territories, and Local Communities</em></strong><br><br>Proactive, early, and ongoing engagement with the public, including disadvantaged, underserved, or overburdened communities, and State, Tribal, local, and territorial partners is fundamental to delivering timely projects that serve the needs and priorities of communities across the country. As part of a robust engagement strategy, which will help inform agencies’ decision-making, agencies will:</p>



<ul><li>Consult with affected Tribal Nations as early as possible, in a sustained manner, and in a fashion that respects the Nation-to-Nation relationship;<br></li><li>Proactively partner and coordinate with relevant State, territorial, and local governments as early as possible and in a sustained manner; and<br></li><li>Review and update policies, procedures, and staffing to ensure that the public, including disadvantaged communities, has a meaningful opportunity to participate in decision-making.</li></ul>



<p><strong><em>Improving Agency Responsiveness, Technical Assistance, and Support</em></strong><br><br>Providing responsive technical assistance and support helps project sponsors, permit applicants, affected communities, Tribal communities, and other stakeholders navigate the environmental review and permitting process effectively and efficiently. To address this need, agencies will:</p>



<ul><li>Identify, share, or develop resources, trainings, and tools to help stakeholders navigate the environmental review and permitting process effectively and efficiently; and<br></li><li>Review environmental review and permitting information collection requirements to help consolidate or simplify reporting requirements, and identify ways that information can be collected more efficiently.</li></ul>



<p><strong><em>Using Agency Resources and Environmental Reviews to Improve Impact</em></strong><br><br>Timely, informative environmental reviews that are guided by the best available science and help deliver positive environmental and community impact require sufficient levels of skilled agency staff and effective use of budgetary resources. Agencies should therefore:</p>



<ul><li>Prioritize available resources to address workforce needs and implementation of the initiatives in this Action Plan;<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Use best practices for accelerated hiring and coordinating with other agencies to efficiently use existing resources, such as conducting collaborative field studies and funding liaison positions; and<br></li><li>Use technology, data, and tools to efficiently and holistically assess environmental and community effects, including information on climate change effects, and identify ways to use new technology to collect, analyze, share, and publicly communicate relevant information.&nbsp;</li></ul>

<p>The House took a critical step today in sending a clear, bipartisan message to Ukraine, to Russia, and to the world that the United States stands with the people of Ukraine as they defend their democracy against Russian aggression. We thank House leadership and members of the Appropriations committee for working across the aisle to get this done, and appreciate the strong bipartisan support for the President’s proposal to provide much needed security, economic, humanitarian, and food assistance to Ukraine, across the region, and around the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our assistance to date, together with the contributions of our Allies and partners, has been critical in helping Ukrainians win the battle for Kyiv and defend their freedoms. The additional resources included in this bill will allow us to send more weapons, such as artillery, armored vehicles, and ammunition, to Ukraine. And they will help us replenish our stockpile and support U.S. troops on NATO territory.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As the President said yesterday, we cannot afford any delay in this vital effort. We look forward to continuing to work with Senate leadership to get this bill to the President’s desk quickly and keep assistance flowing to Ukraine without interruption.</p>
