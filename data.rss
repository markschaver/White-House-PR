										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>Today, President Biden will sign two Presidential directives that will advance national initiatives in quantum information science (QIS), signaling the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to this critical and emerging technology. Together, the two directives lay the groundwork for continued American leadership in an enormously promising field of science and technology, while mitigating the risks that quantum computers pose to America’s national and economic security.</p>



<p>The United States has long been a global leader in the development of new technologies, like QIS. QIS is a broad field of science and engineering. Quantum computers, one of the many promising applications of QIS, are not a replacement to traditional computers. Rather, they are a fundamentally different kind of computer, with the ability to analyze information in ways that traditional computers cannot. While QIS itself is not new, recent breakthroughs in QIS have shown the potential to drive innovations across the American economy, from energy to medicine, through advancements in computation, networking and sensing. Breakthroughs in QIS are poised to generate entirely new industries, good-paying jobs, and economic opportunities for all Americans.</p>



<p>President Biden will sign an Executive Order to foster these advances by furthering the President’s commitment to promoting breakthroughs in cutting-edge science and technology. It does so by enhancing the <a href="http://www.quantum.gov">National Quantum Initiative</a> Advisory Committee, the Federal Government’s principal independent expert advisory body for quantum information science and technology. The EO places the advisory committee directly under the authority of the White House, ensuring that the President, Congress, Federal departments and agencies, and the general public receive the most current, accurate, and relevant information on quantum information science and technology to drive forward U.S. policymaking and advance our technological edge.</p>



<p>The President will also sign a National Security Memorandum outlining the Administration’s plan to address the risks posed by quantum computers to America’s cybersecurity. Research shows that at some point in the not-too-distant future, when quantum computers reach a sufficient size and level of sophistication, they will be capable of breaking much of the cryptography that currently secures our digital communications on the Internet. To address this risk, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) will publish new quantum-resistant cryptographic standards that can protect against these future attacks. However, the process to transition America’s most vulnerable IT systems to these new standards will take time, resources, and commitment. America must start the lengthy process of updating our IT infrastructure today to protect against this quantum computing threat tomorrow. NSM-X lays out a plan to get us there. </p>



<p>Specifically, the National Security Memorandum:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Positions the United States to remain a global leader in technology development, and Quantum Information Science in particular.</strong> The NSM directs Federal agencies to pursue a whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach to harness the economic and scientific benefits of QIS for all Americans, as well as the security enhancements of new cryptographic systems. It sets forth a policy to promote quantum-relevant education programs and workforce development initiatives, emphasizes a coordinated approach to foundational scientific research, and encourages the strengthening of partnerships with industry, academic institutions, and allies and partners overseas.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Initiates collaboration between the Federal Government and the private sector.</strong> It directs NIST to establish a “Migration to Post-Quantum Cryptography Project” at the National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence, as well as an open working group with industry to generate research on, and encourage widespread, equitable adoption of, quantum-resilient cryptographic standards and technologies.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Sets requirements for Federal agencies to update cryptographic systems.</strong> Given the complexity, costs, and time required to fully transition to quantum-resistant cryptographic standards, the NSM provides a roadmap for agencies to inventory their IT systems, with a requirement to set and meet specific milestones. Doing so will help ensure that Federal agencies get the support they need to fully and effectively protect their networks from future exploitation.</li><li><strong>Protects United States technology</strong>. The NSM recognizes the importance of protecting critical technology from theft and abuse. To this end, the NSM directs Federal agencies to develop comprehensive plans to safeguard American intellectual property, research and development, and other sensitive technology from acquisition by America’s adversaries, and to educate industry and academia on the threats they face. It encourages engagement with international partners to ensure a competitive and fair global marketplace that fosters innovation and continued growth in the field.</li></ul>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Via Teleconference</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">(May 3, 2022)</p>



<p>4:35 P.M. EDT</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone.&nbsp; And thank you all for joining today’s background call on the President’s new directives to advance quantum technology.</p>



<p>As a reminder, this call is embargoed until tomorrow, Wednesday, May 4th, at 7:00 a.m. Eastern Time.</p>



<p>For your awareness but not for your reporting, today’s senior administration officials are [senior administration official] and [senior administration official].&nbsp;</p>



<p>With that, I will pass it off to [senior administration official].</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Thank you so much.&nbsp; And hi, everyone.&nbsp; Great to be here with you today.&nbsp; Thanks for joining this press call in advance of the release of two presidential directives on quantum science and tech.</p>



<p>So I want to take a moment to talk through why we chose to release them now and how they fit into the Biden administration’s broader approach to cybersecurity and emerging technology policy.</p>



<p>Since coming into office, the administration has integrated cybersecurity and emerging technology into our national security strategy in a truly unprecedented way.</p>



<p>Our public approach can be summarized by three mutually reinforcing lines of effort I’ve talked about before.&nbsp; First, modernizing our cyber defenses.&nbsp; Second, returning to a more active role leading internationally.&nbsp; And third, ensuring America is postured to compete.</p>



<p>The two presidential directives on quantum tech are part of that third line of effort.&nbsp; They underscore the President’s commitment to fostering innovation in cutting-edge science and technology while continuing to take the necessary steps to safeguard the economy and infrastructure of the future.</p>



<p>This balanced approach of both foster, promote, and protect rests on the President’s conviction that cybersecurity and technological innovation are not in conflict but rather are complementary and essential to the success of one another.</p>



<p>There may be no better illustration of this balancing act than in the field of quantum information science and technology.</p>



<p>Quantum information science &#8212; we’ll call it “QIS,” for short &#8212; is a rapidly emerging scientific discipline that combines our best understanding of the subatomic world &#8212; quantum mechanics &#8212; with our best understanding of information systems &#8212; information theory &#8212; to generate revolutionary technologies and insights.</p>



<p>While QIS itself is not new, recent developments in the field have shown the potential to drive innovation across the American economy, from energy to medicine, through advancements in computing, networking, and sensing.</p>



<p>Much like the earlier technological revolutions brought about by the Internet, GPS, and even the combustion engine, advances in QIS are poised to generate entirely new industries, well-paying jobs, and economic opportunities for all Americans.</p>



<p>The first of the two directives signed today, the executive order, seeks to foster these advances by enhancing the National Quantum Initiative Advisory Committee, the federal government’s principal independent expert advisory body for quantum information science and technology.</p>



<p>How do we do that?&nbsp; The executive order places the advisory committee directly under the authority of the White House, ensuring that the President, Congress, federal departments and agencies, and the general public receive the most current, accurate, and relevant information on quantum information science and technology to drive forward U.S. policymaking in this area.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over the coming weeks, we also plan to announce the members of the advisory board and are already excited by the wide range of expertise and experience the board will bring to bear on these critical issues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yet, while we welcome the many promising applications of QIS, we also acknowledge that advances in quantum technologies pose risks, specifically to America’s economic and national security.</p>



<p>So, the second directive set to be released tomorrow, the national security memorandum, outlines the administration’s plan to address these risks.</p>



<p>Current research shows that at some point in the not-too-distant future, when quantum information science matures and quantum computers are able reach a sufficient size and level of sophistication, they will be capable of breaking much of the cryptography that currently secures our digital communications.</p>



<p>The good news is that this is not an insurmountable problem.&nbsp; The National Institute of Standards and Technology &#8212; NIST &#8212; will soon be publishing new cryptographic standards that can protect against these future attacks.</p>



<p>But the process to transition America’s most vulnerable IT systems to these new standards will take substantial time, resources, and commitment.&nbsp; Accordingly, America must start the lengthy process of updating our IT infrastructure today to protect against this quantum computing threat tomorrow.</p>



<p>So, the national security memorandum lays out a plan to get us there.&nbsp; You will all have the factsheet, so I’ll just cover the toplines.&nbsp;</p>



<p>First, the NSM establishes a national policy that seeks to promote U.S. leadership in quantum information science and quantum tech.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Second, the NSM initiates collaboration between the federal government, industry, and academia as the nation begins the process of migrating to NIST’s new quantum-resistant cryptographic standards.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Third, given the complexity, cost, and time required to fully transition to quantum-resistant standards, the NSM provides a roadmap for agencies to inventory their IT systems for quantum-vulnerable cryptography, and sets a requirement to establish and meet specific milestones for cryptographic migration. </p>



<p>And fourth, the NSM directs the federal government to protect quantum technologies, including foundational research and development, from theft and abuse by criminals and America’s geopolitical adversaries.</p>



<p>I’ll end here by stressing that while these two directives do much to lay the groundwork for continued American leadership in a promising field of science and technology while mitigating many of the risks, tomorrow’s release is just the beginning.</p>



<p>I’ll now turn it over to [senior administration official].<br><br>[Senior administration official]?<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Thanks, [senior administration official], and hello, everyone.&nbsp; For those I haven’t met, I’m [redacted].&nbsp; My office is responsible for coordinating the National Quantum Initiative Act and working across the federal agencies to develop the national strategy for quantum information science.</p>



<p>The U.S. quantum strategy is focused on three things: getting the science right, enhancing American competitiveness, and enabling our people.</p>



<p>As [senior administration official] mentioned, quantum information science is the quintessential emerging and critical technology.<br><br>It is foundational, meaning that it will impact many different technologies from new types of sensors to disruptive quantum computers.<br><br>And it is emerging, because despite decades of funding &#8212; federal investment alone has doubled over the last few years &#8212; we are still learning how applications of this technology may affect society.</p>



<p>Large-scale and high-quality quantum computers are a perfect example.&nbsp; Now, they’re likely many years away, but given the timescales involved for protecting information, it’s critical that we move the nation to quantum-resistant cryptography now.</p>



<p>The two presidential directives being released will help the U.S. balance the scientific and economic imperatives to move fast with our obligation to protect our people, communications, and investments.</p>



<p>Growing the workforce and building the relationships across industry and with our allies internationally will be critical to that success.</p>



<p>I like to say that quantum is more than quantum physics.&nbsp; The skillsets needed to build and understand a quantum computer will be valuable to multiple industries of the future, like AI, autonomy, and cybersecurity.</p>



<p>So it will serve us well to invest in them, and we are seeing the administration’s commitment to that vision today and tomorrow with the &#8212; with these announcements.<br><br>Thanks, and I’ll turn it over to [moderator].</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Thank you, [senior administration official] and [senior administration official].&nbsp; Eric, would you mind reminding us how to ask questions?&nbsp; And then we’ll take some questions now.&nbsp; Thank you.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey.&nbsp; Thank you all so much for doing this today.&nbsp; Can you please speak about the implications that the new national security memorandum will have specifically for the Pentagon and the Defense Department?&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; Great question.&nbsp; So, as I noted earlier &#8212; so, a potent- &#8212; a potential quantum computer could break the cryptography underpinning much of the cryptography that&#8217;s used commercially, but it’s also used in the national security community.&nbsp; And indeed, you know, even a quantum computer a decade from now could potentially be used to decrypt data that&#8217;s encrypted even today.<br><br>So, as such, there&#8217;s a particular need for our national security community to move to post-quantum cryptography.&nbsp; And DoD has made some of the most significant and first investments in this area and is truly leading the U.S. government as we make this transition to quantum-resistant cryptography.<br><br>We’re probably ready for the next question.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hello.&nbsp; I’d like to know where does the U.S. stand in comparison to its adversaries.&nbsp; What would it take for our adversaries to leapfrog ahead of us?<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; I’ll start that and see if [senior administration official] would like to add anything.&nbsp; And the question was a little muffled, but I think you asked, “What would it take for adversaries to leapfrog ahead of us?”<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, please.<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; So, we&#8217;re making &#8212; you know, there are multiple countries who have begun quantum programs around the world and a number of which we are partnering with.&nbsp; And, really, the goal of both the executive order and the national security memorandum is to ensure that we leapfrog well ahead of everyone else, both by promoting quantum information science and the benefits it can potentially bring &#8212; from energy to medicine and various areas of the economy &#8212; as well as to begin what will likely be a decade-long transition to protect our systems from an adversary having a potential quantum computer.<br><br>So, to me, both directives are an example of U.S. innovation and leadership in this space, both on the government side and on the private sector side.<br><br>[Senior administration official], would you like to add anything to that?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Yeah, I&#8217;ll just add quickly that, you know, there are two aspects to maintaining U.S. leadership.&nbsp; The first is getting the science right, investing in building our workforce, which will be critical in this new area.</p>



<p>And then the second side is, you know, ensuring that we’re protected, that; you know, that we&#8217;re &#8212; and that&#8217;s the goal of a good chunk of the NSM: to move our communications networks to (inaudible) cryptography, but also to ensure that our federal funding agencies instituting the best practices for technology protection as they, you know, fund research and development in this area.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, [senior administration official].&nbsp; Thank you for doing this.&nbsp; Can you speak to any sort of cost analysis that you&#8217;re doing on how much it will cost sectors of industries &#8212; whether it&#8217;s, you know, possibly to the energy sector or education or healthcare &#8212; to step up to the new cryptographic standards that you&#8217;re looking at?&nbsp; And are there any plans in place to maybe mitigate or offset some of those costs through federal grants or something like that?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Really good question.&nbsp; So, I&#8217;ll kick it off.&nbsp; And again, we&#8217;ll welcome &#8212; [senior administration official] is one of the leading quantum experts in the U.S. government &#8212; to add color and detail.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, first, you know, the reason we&#8217;re beginning this effort today and the reason for the deep U.S. government-private sector partnership is that while the U.S. government makes its own transition, the broader public-key cryptography used across the Internet is used, obviously, across the private sector as well.</p>



<p>So if we move arm in arm on build-out of the new algorithms, build-out of the new way to share keys, that will also bring down the cost significantly and enable the sharing of the new processes and protocols that will need to be put in place to enable this not only in the U.S., but with foreign partners around the world as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, you know, this partnership, we believe, will significantly drive down the cost.&nbsp; And then, much as the private sector rolls in new routers, switchers &#8212; routers, switches, networking gear, cryptographic gear regularly, those will then transition to quantum-resistant gear over time.</p>



<p>[Senior administration official], over to you to add detail as the, as I said, as one of the leading experts in the government.&nbsp;</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Thank you for the compliments, [senior administration official].&nbsp;</p>



<p>You know, one of the primary purposes of the NSM is to move the country &#8212; the whole country, not just the government &#8212; the whole country as quickly as possible to quantum-resistant cryptography.&nbsp; And &#8212; and a strong secondary goal is to do that equitably &#8212; right? &#8212; because we realize that, you know, this will pr- &#8212; this will, you know, require changes, upgrades to information technology across the whole spectrum of companies and federal agencies.</p>



<p>So, a key part of the NSM is trying to understand those costs and setting a tight timeline for the federal government to do assessments of what&#8217;s needed, what systems are vulnerable, how much will it cost to upgrade them, and how can we try to do it equitably so we don&#8217;t leave, you know, a smaller company, you know, to do this (inaudible) on their own, but to make it easier for them.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah, thank you for doing this.&nbsp; Just on the question of quantum-resistant cryptography, is that something that is achievable through classical computers?&nbsp; Or does that require</p>



<p>quantum computers to achieve?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Yeah, so I think that&#8217;s exactly the point.&nbsp; You know, the core mathematical rule that we rely on to protect our most secure cryptography from the capabilities of a classical computer, that algorithm- &#8212; that core mathematical rule kind of falls before a quantum computer</p>



<p>due to an algorithm that was proved a number of years ago &#8212; Shor&#8217;s Algorithm.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, essentially, that&#8217;s exactly the point: A quantum computer will potentially have the ability to break the cryptography that today is resistant, even the most advanced classical computers.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; If I could add, you know, that the &#8212; another really important point is that you don&#8217;t need a quantum computer to make quantum-resistant cryptography. You know, you can design new classical algorithms that work on the routers and networks we (inaudible) today that are resilient to a future quantum computer.&nbsp; You don&#8217;t need quantum networks.&nbsp; You don&#8217;t need quantum technology.&nbsp; That&#8217;s a really important point because while most of quantum information science technology is in the research phase, you know, quantum-resistant algorithms are very much in the development and deployment phase.&nbsp;</p>



<p>NIST is running an international competition now and it’s expected to release winners &#8212; you know, first round of winners very soon and then move very quickly to the parameterization to make it a (inaudible) standard, and that will be deployment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And you can do that because of just (inaudible) classical technology; you don&#8217;t need anything quantum to make that happen.&nbsp; That&#8217;s a really important point.&nbsp; And thanks for asking that question.</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Okay, everyone, thank you for joining our call. As a reminder, this is embargoed until tomorrow, Wednesday, May 4th at 7:00 a.m.&nbsp; And everything on this call was attributable to a “senior administration official.”&nbsp; Please reach out if you have any question.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Thank you all.&nbsp; Thank you, [senior administration official].&nbsp; Thank you, [senior administration official].&nbsp;&nbsp; Be well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Thank you, everybody.</p>

<p>Today, President Biden&nbsp;is announcing&nbsp;that for the first time in over 50 years, the White House will host a Conference on Hunger, Nutrition and Health&nbsp;this September. The Conference, and the preparatory work leading up to it, will&nbsp;accelerate progress and drive significant change to end hunger, improve nutrition and physical activity, reduce diet-related disease, and close the disparities around them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Biden-Harris Administration has set a goal of ending hunger and increasing healthy eating and physical activity in the U.S. by 2030 so that fewer Americans experience diet-related diseases, such as diabetes, obesity, and hypertension. The Conference will galvanize action by anti-hunger and nutrition advocates; food companies; the health care community; local, state, territorial and Tribal governments; people with lived experiences; and all Americans, and it will launch a national plan outlining how we achieve this goal.</p>



<p>“Hunger, diet-related disease, and the disparities surrounding them impact millions of Americans, and the COVID-19 pandemic put a spotlight on the urgency of addressing these issues. No one should have to wonder where their next meal will come from. We must take bold steps now—with government, the private sector, non-profits, and communities working together—to build a healthier future for every American.” — Ambassador Susan E. Rice, Domestic Policy Advisor</p>



<p>The first White House Conference on Food, Nutrition and Health in 1969 was a pivotal event that influenced the country’s food policy agenda for the next 50 years. The President sets out to do the same with&nbsp;this year’s Conference.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Leading up to the Conference, the Biden-Harris Administration will host listening sessions so that we can hear from every region of the country.  Anyone with ideas will soon be able to share their stories to help inform the national plan.

<p>National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan met today with Akiba Takeo, the Secretary General of Japan’s National Security Secretariat, to discuss preparations for the President’s upcoming trip to the Republic of Korea and Japan. Mr. Sullivan commended Japan’s strong response to Russia’s brutal and unjustified further invasion of Ukraine, including financial sanctions, export controls, and humanitarian and defense assistance for Ukraine and they agreed to continue working closely together on the international response to Russia’s aggression. Secretary General Akiba welcomed the President’s visit to Tokyo, noting that it would send a strong signal to the region and beyond about the U.S. commitment to the Indo-Pacific. The two agreed that the meeting between the President and Prime Minister Kishida is an opportunity to affirm the strength of the U.S.-Japan alliance, take steps to strengthen deterrence in the region, and advance our shared vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific.  Mr. Sullivan highlighted the importance of the second in-person Quad Leaders Meeting as a key event in demonstrating that the Quad is delivering results for the people of the region.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Lockheed Martin Pike County Operations<br>Troy, Alabama</p>



<p>2:03 P.M. CDT</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; I tell you what, Linda: If I were CEO of this company, I’d be worried.&nbsp; (Laughter.)</p>



<p>Well, good afternoon, everybody.&nbsp; And thank you, Jim, for the invitation to be here today and, Linda, for the warm welcome today.&nbsp; And Congressman Sewell &#8212; -woman Sewell, thank you for all you do for the people of this state and the country and for your friendship &#8212; our friendship.</p>



<p>I wanted to come down to Alabama to make sure that the American people know what workers at this &#8212;</p>



<p>And, by the way, if you have a seat, please take it.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; By the way, sometimes &#8212; the press is always fair with me, but once &#8212; every once in a while, I make a mistake &#8212; not like &#8212; well, once a speech.</p>



<p>But, at any rate, I &#8212; years ago, when I first started talking to this &#8212; for this job, I said, “Please take your seats.”&nbsp; There weren’t any seats.&nbsp; Everyone was standing.&nbsp; There were no chairs.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; So, I just wanted to make sure I checked whether you had seats.</p>



<p>Look, the American people know what workers at this facility are doing and support &#8212; to support Ukraine’s fight for freedom.</p>



<p>And the bottom line is I came to say thank you, thank you, thank you.&nbsp; That’s the reason I’m here.</p>



<p>I’ve been on those battlefields where these missiles are fired, and I spent a lot of time going in and out of Iraq and Afghanistan &#8212; maybe a total of 40 times.&nbsp; And I tell you what: You’re &#8212; and I’ve been in Ukraine a lot prior to the war and on the border since the war.&nbsp; And it’s &#8212; it’s amazing what you’ve done.</p>



<p>We see on the news every single day the atrocities and the war crimes that are being committed by Russian forces in Ukraine, directed by Vladimir Putin.&nbsp; And it really is gut-wrenching.</p>



<p>We see the incredible bravery of the Ukrainian fighters defending their country from ev- &#8212; with everything they have.&nbsp; And, by the way, it’s not just their warriors.&nbsp; It’s not just their military.&nbsp; It’s people in the street &#8212; people in the street, staying behind.&nbsp; A lot have gotten out &#8212; 5 million &#8212; but a lot are staying, including women as well as men, staying to fight for their country.</p>



<p>And &#8212; and we know that the United States is leading our Allies and partners around the world to make sure that courageous Ukrainians who are fighting for the future of their nation have the weapons and the capacity and ammunition and equipment to defend themselves against Putin’s brutal war.&nbsp; A lot of war crimes being committed.</p>



<p>But what we don’t &#8212; what we don’t see &#8212; we don’t always see &#8212; is the work that so much of &#8212; that makes so much of this possible.&nbsp; And that’s you.&nbsp; It’s not hyperbole.&nbsp; It’s you.&nbsp; You make it possible.&nbsp; You make it possible for them to have a shot.</p>



<p>You know, during World War Two, the United States was known as the arsenal of democracy.&nbsp; There was Rosie the Riveter &#8212; who I actually got to meet, quite frankly, before she passed away &#8212; and a lot of people who, in fact, kept the &#8212; kept it going.</p>



<p>I was &#8212; a slight digression &#8212; I went over for the 50th anniversary of the &#8212; the end of World War Two.&nbsp; And I was in Normandy, and I went up afterwards with the &#8212; to the cemetery.&nbsp; And I was walking by myself.&nbsp; And it’s &#8212; it’s incredible.&nbsp; It’s immaculate.&nbsp; It’s perfectly manicured, and the headstones are all the same.</p>



<p>I looked down one row, and I saw three names &#8212; same names.&nbsp; A father and two sons who had died in the landing.&nbsp; And I was bent down, and I was reading the dates of their birth.&nbsp; And all of a sudden, I heard behind me, “Attention!”&nbsp; And I turned around and there was a gentleman who had to be in his early 80s, in a wheelchair, being wheeled by his son who &#8212; big guy &#8212; looked like Hoss Cartwright &#8212; and his &#8212; and his wife and one of their &#8212; and a daughter.</p>



<p>And he saluted me, so I saluted him, and &#8212; at the time.&nbsp; And I turned around, and I said, “Thank you for what you did.&nbsp; Thank you for saving &#8212; literally saving civilization.”</p>



<p>And he put his hand on his wife’s &#8212; his wife &#8212; his hand was on her shoulder.&nbsp; And he said, “No, no.&nbsp; She did it.&nbsp; She did it.”</p>



<p>And I looked at her, and he said, “She built the landing craft that got us in here.&nbsp; She and her friends &#8212; they’re the ones that did it.”&nbsp; And he went on.&nbsp; And he filled up.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And all of a sudden, it dawned on me: You’re doing it.&nbsp; You really are doing it.&nbsp; You’re making a gigantic difference for these poor sons of guns who are under such enormous, enormous pressure and firepower.</p>



<p>Those Javelins I saw &#8212; there’s 10 for every tank that there is in Ukraine right now.&nbsp; You’re changing people’s lives.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; We built the weapons &#8212; no, you really do.&nbsp; But we built the weapons and the equipment that helped defend freedom and sovereignty in Europe years ago.&nbsp; But that’s true again today.</p>



<p>You know, some of the best, most effective weapons in our arsenal are those Javelin missiles, like the ones manufactured right here in Pike County.</p>



<p>They’re highly portable.&nbsp; They’re extremely effective against a wide range of armored targets.&nbsp; They can hit targets up to <s>400</s> [4,000] meters away and have a “fire-and-forget” capability.&nbsp; That means the person firing can &#8212; and I know you know it, but for anybody who may be listening &#8212; can change positions or take cover before that Javelin even strikes home and strikes the target.</p>



<p>In fact, they’ve been so important there’s even a story about Ukrainian parents naming their children &#8212; not a joke &#8212; their newborn child “Javelin” or “Javelina.”&nbsp; Not a joke.</p>



<p>So, the brave people of Ukraine, including the many civilians who have taken up arms to defend their country, deserve every ounce of credit for pushing back the Russian assault and frustrating Putin’s desire to dominate Ukraine.</p>



<p>We’re at an inflection point in history, for real &#8212; it comes along about every six or eight generations &#8212; where things are changing so rapidly that we have to be in control.</p>



<p>Folks, there’s an ongoing battle in the world between autocracy and democracy.&nbsp; Xi Jinping, the leader of China, who I’ve talked &#8212; I’ve spent more time with than any other world leader has &#8212; over 78 hours on the &#8212; either in person or on the telephone with him.&nbsp; And the fact of the matter is he just is straightforward about it.&nbsp; He says that democracies cannot be sustained in the 21st century.&nbsp; Not a joke.&nbsp; They cannot be sustained &#8212; because things are moving so rapidly, democracies require consensus, and it’s hard to get consensus, therefore they can’t keep up with an autocracy &#8212; one-man rule.</p>



<p>But that’s not going to be the case.&nbsp; If that happens, the whole world changes.</p>



<p>And because of you &#8212; in this first, really, battle, if you will &#8212; for that to determine whether that’s going to happen is because you’re making it possible.&nbsp; You’re making it possible for the Ukrainian people to defend themselves without us having to risk getting in a third world war by sending in American soldiers fighting Russian soldiers.<br><br>My dad used to have an expression.&nbsp; He’d say, “The only war worse than one that’s intended is one that’s unintended.”<br><br>You’re allowing the Ukrainians to defend themselves.&nbsp; And, quite frankly, they’re making fools of the Russian military in many instances.</p>



<p>A big part of the reason they’ve been able to keep on fighting and to make this war a strategic failure for Russia is because the United States, together with our Allies and partners, have had their back.</p>



<p>The United States alone has committed more than 5,500 Javelins to Ukraine.&nbsp; You’re changing the nation.&nbsp; You really are.&nbsp; Add to that significant supplies from our Allies and partners, as well as many thousands of other anti-tank and anti-air weapons, helicopters, armored vehicles, artillery, coastal defense systems.</p>



<p>Before Russia attacked, we made sure <s>Russia</s> [Ukraine] had Javelins and other weapons to strengthen their defenses so Ukraine was ready for whatever happened.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And in the last two months, we continued to move even more resources and equipment at a rapid pace into Ukraine.&nbsp; We’ve made sure that there are no interruptions in the flow of equipment to Ukraine.</p>



<p>Since Russia invaded Ukraine just over two months ago, we have sent more than $3 billion in security assistance to Ukraine &#8212; alone, us &#8212; not counting our Allies.&nbsp; And that money is a direct investment in defending freedom and democracy itself.</p>



<p>Because if you don’t stand up to dictators, history has shown us they keep coming.&nbsp; They keep coming. &nbsp;Their appetite for power continues to grow.</p>



<p>And every worker in this facility and every American taxpayer is directly contributing to the case for freedom.&nbsp; And that’s something we can all be incredibly proud of, in my view.</p>



<p>Last week, I sent Congress &#8212; if you excuse a point of personal privilege, talking like an old senator &#8212; but I sent a supplemental budget &#8212; a fancy way of saying we need more money &#8212; to make sure the United States can continue to send weapons directly to the frontlines of freedom in Ukraine and to continue to provide economic and humanitarian assistance to help the Ukrainian people.</p>



<p>And I urge the Congress to pass this funding quickly to help Ukraine continue to succeed against Russian aggression, just as they did when they won the Battle of Kyiv, and to make sure the United States and our Allies can replenish our own stocks of weapons to replace what we’ve sent to Ukraine.</p>



<p>As I said from the beginning, this fight is not going to be cheap, but caving to aggression would even be more costly.<br><br>We either back the Ukrainian people as they defend their country or stand by as Russia continues its atrocities and aggression.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I know what my answer is, and I think you all do too.&nbsp; I bet I know what the answer of this plant is.</p>



<p>There’s something else here that &#8212; to be understand.&nbsp; Being the arsenal of democracy also means good-paying jobs for American workers in Alabama and the states all across America where defense equipment is manufactured and assembled.</p>



<p>Two hundred and sixty-five people here at this plant are directly employed working on the Javelin program.&nbsp; All told, Lockheed Martin has brought nearly 3,000 jobs to Alabama.</p>



<p>The Armed Forces of the United States of America is going to continue to be the best-armed, most capable fighting force in the history of the world.</p>



<p>In order to do that, we have to make sure our vital defense <s>supplies</s> [suppliers] are getting the inputs and supplies they need to produce and protect and provide the full capacity.</p>



<p>I learned on the tour today that each of the Javelins you produce includes more than 200 semiconductors.&nbsp; I’ve been a broken record, as the press will tell you, on our need to be able to produce more semiconductors in the United States.<br><br>We invented the sucker, going to the moon &#8212; we, the United States.&nbsp; We’re the one that modernized it.&nbsp; We’ve done more than anybody else.&nbsp; But guess what?&nbsp; We stopped investing in ourselves.&nbsp; We stopped investing in ourselves.<br><br>And so, now we’re back in the game, making sure that we become &#8212; we become the primary producer of those semiconductors &#8212; computer chips that power much of our modern lives.&nbsp;<br><br>They’re in our phones, our cars, almost anything that has an on/off switch.&nbsp; And the semiconductor is critical to defense production capacity, as you &#8212; you all know better than I do.</p>



<p>That’s why we are making it as hard as we can for Russia to get a hold of semiconductors and advanced technologies that it could use to upgrade its military during this conflict, and why we’re taking steps to make it easier to source what we need here in the United States during a global semiconductor shortage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And just one more &#8212; there is just one more reason why Congress has to act quickly to provide the emergency funding for the so-called CHIPS Act by passing the broader Bipartisan Innovation Act so we can produce tens of millions of these chips.</p>



<p>There is something we have to focus on and something I’ve focused on from my earliest days of our administration: I’m determined to make sure the United States holds the technological high ground in competition with other nations, especially China, as we move forward.</p>



<p>Folks, you know, we &#8212; we used to invest, as a nation, years ago &#8212; 35 years ago, we invested 2 percent of our entire GDP in research and development.&nbsp; We do half of that now.&nbsp; We do half of that.&nbsp; We used to be number one in the world.&nbsp; Now we’re number 13 in the world.&nbsp; My administration &#8212; we’re changing that.<br><br>The United States used to own the innovation field.&nbsp; In fact, it was a Department of [Defense] research program that established DARPA.&nbsp; It was the first development of an anti-tank missile with advanced infrared guidance systems that culminated in today’s Javelin.</p>



<p>The Bipartisan Innovation Act is going to help reverse decades-long decline in federal research and development investment.&nbsp; And it should create [jobs] and support entire families, and expand U.S. manufacturing and strengthen our national security.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Where in God&#8217;s name is it written that the United States can no longer be a leading manufacturer in the world?&nbsp; We&#8217;ve created, just in the last 17 months, 465,000 permanent manufacturing jobs in America.&nbsp; We have the best workers, the most competent employees, the best science in the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And by funding the CHIPS Act, we&#8217;re going to ensure the semiconductors that power the economy and our national security are made here in America again.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, all &#8212; all the world&#8217;s most advanced chips are made overseas.&nbsp; But the events of the past few years have proven beyond a doubt that America’s security should never be held hostage to events overseas &#8212; not a pandemic, not a war, not the politics of &#8212; ambition, or other countries.</p>



<p>Fundamentally, there&#8217;s a national &#8212; this is a national security issue.&nbsp; This is one of the reasons why the Chinese Communist Party is lobbying folks to oppose this bill.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s an issue that unites Democrats and Republicans.</p>



<p>So, let&#8217;s get it done.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s get it done.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In her introduction, Linda said she personally touched every single solitary Javelin &#8212; 50,000 &#8212; that had been manufactured in this plant 20 years ago.</p>



<p>I was worried to shake your hand.&nbsp; I thought you may &#8212; I might be electrocuted.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; But that’s where they start: right here with American skill, American craftsmanship, American patriotism.</p>



<p>And just a few days ago, the Wall Street Journal quoted a young <s>Hungarian</s> [Ukrainian] fighter saying, and I quote, “Without the Javelins, it would have been very hard to stop the enemy pushing ahead.”&nbsp; End of quote.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So these weapons, touched by the hands &#8212; your hands &#8212; are in the hands of Ukrainian heroes, making a significant difference.&nbsp; And that’s something each and every day you could and should be proud of.</p>



<p>And I&#8217;m once more urging Congress to quickly pass the supplemental funding bill for over <s>$300</s> [$30] billion to help the Ukrainians so they can keep &#8212; they can keep all of the very, very &#8212; all of you very, very busy for a while here.</p>



<p>So, again, let me end where I began.&nbsp; I came for a basic reason, from the bottom of my heart: to say thank you.&nbsp; Thank you, thank you, thank you for what you do.&nbsp; Thank you for what you continue to do.&nbsp; Unless you go out in the field and see it, you don&#8217;t realize what a difference you&#8217;re making.&nbsp;</p>



<p>May God bless you all.&nbsp; And may God protect our troops. Thank you so much.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Aboard Air Force One<br>En Route Montgomery, Alabama</p>



<p>12:52 P.M. EDT</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Okay, given I already did an extensive rundown yesterday of what we will be doing here in Troy, why don’t we just get to your questions?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, the President spoke pretty passionately on the tarmac about the Alito draft being an affront to basic rights.&nbsp; But he also said he was not ready to commit to ending the filibuster to codify Roe.&nbsp; Why?</p>



<p>And is there a disconnect here between the passion and what needs &#8212; what he believes needs to be done?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, first, let me say the President’s position is that we need to codify Roe, and that is what he has long called on Congress to act on.</p>



<p>What is also true is that there has been a vote on the Women’s Health Protection Act which would do exactly that, and there were not even enough votes, even if there was no filibuster, to get that done.</p>



<p>So, I would note, in his written statement that we released this morning &#8212; I’m just going to reiterate what he said in this statement.&nbsp; He said, “…if the Court does overturn Roe, it will fall on our nation’s elected officials at all levels of government to protect a woman’s right to choose” &#8212; to do exactly that.&nbsp; “It will fall on voters to elect pro-choice officials this November.&nbsp; At the federal level, we will need more pro-choice senators and a pro-choice majority in the House to adopt legislation.”&nbsp; And that was speaking to exactly where we are with the votes.</p>



<p>I would note that while we’ve been in the air, Leader Schumer noted that he had plans to bring this up for a vote.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are you surprised that this leaked out?&nbsp; What do you think about the leak itself?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Look, I think this is &#8212; because it is unprecedented &#8212; or almost unprecedented, depending on what historian you speak to &#8212; there&#8217;s no question that that raises eyebrows for many in the country, including those of us in the White House.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But what our focus is on right now, beyond the leak, is &#8212; is how we&#8217;re going to protect a woman&#8217;s right to make choices about her healthcare with her doctor &#8212; a right that is supported by the vast majority of the American public.</p>



<p>And some call it a political issue.&nbsp; It is not.&nbsp; It is supported by the majority of the American public.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But when you look at the solutions that you put forward in that statement or the actions that the White House was considering taking, a lot of those take time.&nbsp; So, what is the White House&#8217;s message to women around the country who are waking up today and realizing their daughters and their &#8212; you know, younger women in this country may have less constitutional rights than they had in their lifetime?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Let me say first: This law has not changed.&nbsp; We know that it was &#8212; the Supreme Court has said the draft itself was legitimate, but they did not say this was the final conclusion.&nbsp; So, women waking up today &#8212; their daughters still have the same rights they had yesterday.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But I will note, though, that we have already seen, in a number of states, actions taken that severely limit women&#8217;s fundamental rights across the country &#8212; a right that has been law for 50 years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And what we have done already to date is take steps through our Gender Policy Council to provide and expand access wherever we can with our capacity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, for example, we created the Dire Need Grant awards, which provide funding to expand access to emergency contraception and family planning services, and recently announced $6.6 million in awards made to aid grantees around the country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to immediate legal action by the Department of Justice against Texas, the Attorney General released a statement in response to SB 8 that reaffirmed the Department of Justice&#8217;s commitment to using existing federal law to protect the safety of patients seeking access to reproductive health services, including abortion, pursuant to their criminal and civil enforcement of the FACE Act.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That&#8217;s important for anybody waking up today and confused about what their rights are.&nbsp; They have rights.&nbsp; This has not changed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Finally, the Department of Health and Human Services has announced a three-pronged, department-wide response to protect patients and providers in response to the Texas law SB 8.</p>



<p>What I would note and the President also said in his statement this morning is that he&#8217;s directed his Gender Policy Council and the White House Counsel&#8217;s Office to prepare options for an administration response to the continued and obviously more expansive attack on abortion and reproductive rights.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, since then &#8212; since the Texas law banned most abortions and the White House said that there was going to be a whole-of-government response to that &#8212; so, mostly, it’s just the things that you just read.&nbsp; Are there any other actions that the administration did take?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Those were some of the steps that have been announced.&nbsp; But what I would note is that we will continue &#8212; and he direc- &#8212; he has directed the Gender Policy Council and the Counsel’s Office to prepare and to be prepared to respond.</p>



<p>There are things that we know because states have said them,&nbsp;so I would note that if Roe fails, abortion would probably be illegal in about half the states.&nbsp; Up to 26 states &#8212; particularly in the South, Midwest, and West &#8212; are poised to further restrict or ban access depending on the Court&#8217;s decision.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s beca- &#8212; and partly because 13 states have trigger laws, which means that they would immediately trigger banning abortion.</p>



<p>As a result of that, tens of millions of women may lack access to reproductive healthcare services.&nbsp; Abortion bans and restrictions will also dramatically reduce access to reproductive care, particularly for women with low income, women of color, and women in rural communities.</p>



<p>We know through the data that we&#8217;ve already looked at that 75 percent of those seeking abortion are living at or below 200 percent of the federal poverty level.&nbsp; And the majority of patients seeking abortions identify as Black, Hispanic, and AAPI.</p>



<p>So, it&#8217;s important for everybody to understand that the people who would be impacted the most are lower income, are people who would have to take off work, are people who would have to find a way to travel, people who would have to find a way to get childcare.</p>



<p>I would also note that 60 percent of people who seek an abortion are moms already.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, is the White House starting to put together a plan just in case the Supreme Court does overturn Roe &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; That is exactly what the President said in his statement.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To follow up on Jen &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you speak to a timeline of the &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I follow up on what Jen said, though?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, okay.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To follow up on what Jen was saying, though &#8212; that back in December, you had said in a statement &#8212; we&#8217;ve heard the President say this &#8212; about the work he would be doing to work with lawmakers on codifying Roe.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Can you give us examples, now that we are in early May, from that time in December of where this has been on his priority list?&nbsp; How has he engaged with lawmakers on this?&nbsp; Anything specific of what he has done beyond the Gender Policy Council.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I think it&#8217;s important to note that there has been a vote on this; it failed.&nbsp; It did not have even 50 votes, which means even if the filibuster were overturned, there would have not had been enough votes to get this passed.&nbsp; He has stated this many times publicly.&nbsp; This is his known position. This is many of &#8212; one of many topics he discusses with lawmakers.</p>



<p>I would note again that Leader Schumer indicated he plans to bring it up again.&nbsp; But in the President&#8217;s statement, just to reiterate, what he pointed to is the fact that there needs to be a more &#8212; more pro-choice officials after the elections in November.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, the &#8212; if all the polling is correct and abortion rights folks have public sentiment on their side, why have people continued to vote for a party that wants to do away with abortion rights?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; That sounds like a question for those people who vote that way.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May I circle back to Steve&#8217;s question on the leak itself?&nbsp; Does the President agree with Justice Roberts that this was an egregious act?&nbsp; And does he believe that it should be criminally prosecuted?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; This would be a decision made by the Department of Justice, and we would refer to them.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, is this a live issue for you to push on the campaign trail this year, to try to help elect more pro-choice people?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I&#8217;m not &#8212; I can&#8217;t and I&#8217;m not going to speak to politics from this gaggle.&nbsp; But I would again point you to the President&#8217;s statement, where he very clearly refere- &#8212; addressed exactly that question.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On court packing: Has this raised any more discussions within the White House about the Supreme Court?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would say, first, you know, the President &#8212; there&#8217;s a commission that was put together.&nbsp; The commission put together a report not on recommendations, but to look at the big legal questions that have been out there for some time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The 30-member commission &#8212; member commission, with a diversity of views, put together a report that the President has been reviewing, so we have no update on his position on expansion of the Court.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey, Jen, I wonder what this says about the state of our democracy that, you know, abortion is an issue that a large number, a large swath of Americans agree with, yet we continue to see these consistent attacks, you know, by a party that represents a minority of Americans.&nbsp; Does this say something about the state of our democracy?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Look, I think the reason that I felt and the President felt it was important for me to reiterate who this impacts is because, right now, this is a moment to educate the public on what the impact would be.&nbsp; Right?&nbsp; It is often shorthanded &#8212; not by any of us but in public discourse &#8212; as a political issue, as a wedge issue.&nbsp; It is not a wedge issue.&nbsp; The majority of the public supports women’s fundamental rights.&nbsp;&nbsp;And the people who would be impacted overwhelmingly are lower-income and are people of color.&nbsp; And we need to be clear about that in how we communicate about it so everybody understands as we &#8212; as this battle begins.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We heard the President talk about other rights.&nbsp; He talked about birth control.&nbsp; He brough up same-sex marriage.&nbsp; Can you expand on that, of just the concern at the White House about knowing this is a draft opinion, not finalized &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; of what this means for other things and the precedent it could set?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; Well, I think what you heard the President say to all of you under the wing reflects what has been front and center on his mind.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Obviously, there&#8217;s a lot to say about this leaked report.&nbsp; And when he was &#8212; last night, his Chief of Staff called him to alert him of the news and the report, we made the decision to take some time to do a thorough and thoughtful written statement this morning.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And obviously, he made the decision to speak to all of you under the wing.&nbsp; And what you heard him talk about is a reflection of his time as Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, as somebody who has read, reviewed, looked at many Supreme Court decisions, and the fa- &#8212; and his concern &#8212; his personal concern, his concern as President of the United States about the precedent of this or what other fundamental rights, as you heard him say, could be at risk.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who told him that the draft was legitimate?&nbsp; Was it &#8212; like, did the Chief Justice call him, or who informed the President?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; There were reports about it, and so we let him know that there had been reports right before he arrived.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So it was a White House staffer &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yes.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; who telephoned him in the car?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Okay.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You mentioned that the President would, after the midterms, that he wanted to see more pro-life lawmakers in office.&nbsp; But will he be &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Pro-choice.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, pro-choice.&nbsp; Excuse me.&nbsp; Would there be &#8212; is he making any effort prior to the midterms to connect with lawmakers to try and increase the number of votes that could vote for the legislation that Senator Schumer wants to bring forward?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Again, you know, this is his publicly stated view, something that he has made clear privately on many occasions as well.&nbsp; But I think it&#8217;s also important to note, again, that we did not have the 50 votes.</p>



<p>If there &#8212; if there was a bill sent to his desk to codify Roe, he&#8217;d be happy to sign it.&nbsp; We did not have even 50 votes, even if the filibuster were overturned.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But does he want to spend some time to try and increase that number &#8212; work with lawmakers; make personal pleas; you know, talk to them about this?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; And I think you should talk to the lawmakers about whether their minds are changeable.&nbsp; I think you saw what the President said in his statement about what we all have a responsibility to focus on in the coming months.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there anything that the White House thinks that there is enough votes for before the midterms?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Like what?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On anything related to abortion.&nbsp; And &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I can&#8217;t, in this moment, make an assessment of that.&nbsp; Obviously, codifying Roe is something the President would strongly support and would be happy to sign into law.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, on this visit today to Alabama, is there any concern that going and visiting the factory that is being used to make the munitions that are destroying the tanks in Russia right &#8212; or not in Russia, but in Ukraine &#8212; Russian army tanks &#8212; that it&#8217;s kind of bragging about what we&#8217;re doing and it will only escalate?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; The President is visiting this factory today to showcase American manufacturing, American ingenuity, and the power of the American military and capacity to support the Ukrainians as they&#8217;re fighting a war against Russian aggression.</p>



<p>And so, no, he does not have that fear.&nbsp; In fact, he feels this is an opportunity to thank the American people for their support in our effort to support the Ukrainians.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Brittney Griner &#8212; can I ask you on that?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.</p>



<p>Q    Now that the U.S. government considers her to be wrongfully detained by the Russian government, in practical terms, what does that new distinction mean in terms of what the administration will be doing to try and secure her release?  Will the White House talk about her case more now that it has shifted to this?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  So, that is a determination we’d make in coordination with the hostage negotiator and the &#8212; and the State Department.  So, <s>Richard</s> [Roger] Car- &#8212; <s>Richard</s> [Roger]? &#8212; yes &#8212; Carstens would now be engaged in this.  So this was a determination made by the State Department and &#8212; and released, obviously, last night.<br><br>But typically &#8212; and I don’t believe this will change &#8212; in order to &#8212; to leave the space to have an outcome we all want and desire &#8212; which is to bring her and any American detained or unjustifiably detained home &#8212; we typically don’t talk about it extensively.<br><br>Q    Are you expecting Ru- &#8212; look, just one &#8212; one more Ukraine thing.  Are you expecting Russia to try to annex areas of eastern Ukraine on &#8212; by May 9th or on May 9th?<br><br>Q    And officially declare war by May 9th?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  I don’t have any predictions of exactly what President Putin or the Russian military will do by May 9th.  But I think you saw a State &#8212; the State Department go out yesterday and make clear that we did assess that one of the considerations &#8212; and &#8212; and we have a valid reason to believe this, that would be straight out of Russia’s playbook &#8212; would be for them to organize sham referrals &#8212; referenda in Crimea, in Luhansk, in Donetsk, and in other places to try to del- &#8212; delegitimize democratically elected leaders and impose fake people’s councils essentially made up of the Kremlin’s puppets and proxies.<br><br>We’ve seen them do this before.  And so, what they went out yesterday to &#8212; to announce was based on our assessment &#8212; a highly credible assessment.  But in terms of the timeline, I don’t have any update on that for you.<br><br>Q    On &#8212; sorry about that.  On Javelins, you made the point yesterday they’ve been very effective, but there’s been quite a substantial drawdown &#8212; both of the Javelins and the Stingers, which has also been effective.  Are we now at a point where the Javelin and the Stinger is going to be put on a pause in what can be shipped to Ukrainians until both Lockheed and Raytheon can backfill the orders on these?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  I would say, first, the biggest challenge we have is the funding &#8212; right? &#8212; because we have a limited amount of drawdown funding left, as you know, which is why the President is also going to talk about the urgency of getting the supplemental package through.  We have about $250 million left, as you know. </p>



<p>But we &#8212; our Defense Department assesses, of course, ensuring that we have the capacity and the ability to not only deliver what we promised but also to &#8212; to backfill our needs, which is part of what we&#8217;ve requested in the &#8212; in the funding moving forward.<br><br>Q    On the threats from Russia about nuclear weapons or the loose talk about nuclear weapons, what kind of diplomatic efforts the do the &#8212; do we, the United States, have right now to talk them off of that?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Well, first, we find their rhetoric to be completely unconstructive and inconsistent with what many Russian officials have said many times in the past, which is that there is no winning a nuclear war.  So, we have not made any changes in our assessment right now of &#8212; our </p>



<p>substantive assessment of what is happening on the ground.</p>



<p>But, again, we continued to encourage them to and call on them to reduce the rhetoric, given we all know that a nuclear war cannot be won.</p>



<p>Q On student debt, what does the administration think are adequate income caps for any of the student forgiveness programs?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: Well, the President talked, back on the campaign, about taking steps or looking at steps to help people making less than $125,000 a year, so that is the frame through which he&#8217;s considering &#8212; making considerations at this point.</p>



<p>And it&#8217;s Roger Carstens. Sorry, I butchered his name, and I didn&#8217;t mean to. He does very important work for the government.  Remarkable work.  Maybe some of the most important work.<br><br>Q    Thank you.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Thank you, everyone.<br><br></p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Joint Base Andrews<br>Prince George’s County, Maryland</p>



<p>11:24 A.M. EDT<br><br>Q    What do you think of the ruling &#8212; or the draft that leaked, sir?<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, I just got a call saying that it’s been announced that it is a real draft, but it doesn’t represent who’s going to vote for it yet.  I hope there are not enough votes for it.<br><br>It’s the main reason why I worked so hard to keep Robert Bork off the Court.  It reflects his view almost &#8212; almost word &#8212; anyway.<br><br>Look, the idea that &#8212; it concerns me a great deal that we’re going to, after 50 years, decide a woman does not have a right to choose within the limits of the Supreme Court decision in Casey, number one.<br><br>But even more equally as profound is the rationale used.  And it would mean that every other decision relating to the notion of privacy is thrown into question. <br><br>I realize this goes back a long way, but one of the debates I had with Robert Bork was whether &#8212; whether Griswold vs. Connecticut should stand as law. <br><br>The state of Connecticut said that the privacy of your bedroom &#8212; you &#8212; a husband and wife or a couple could not choose to use contraception; the use of contraception was a violation of the law.<br><br>If the rationale of the decision as released were to be sustained, a whole range of rights are in question &#8212; a whole range of rights.  And the idea we’re letting the states make those decisions, localities make those decisions would be a fundamental shift in what we’ve done.<br><br>So, it goes far beyond &#8212; in my view, if it becomes a law and if what is written is what remains, it goes far beyond the concern of whether or not there is the right to choose.  It goes to other basic rights: the right to marry, the right to determine a whole range of things.  Because one of the issues that this Court &#8212; many of the members of the Court &#8212; a number of the members of the Court have not acknowledged is that there is a right to privacy in our Constitution.<br><br>I strongly believe there is.  I think the decision in Griswold was correct overruling; I think the decision in Roe was correct, because there’s a right to privacy.  There can be limitations on it, but it cannot be denied.<br><br>Q    Do you think this leak has irreparably changed the Court?<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:  Beg your pardon?<br><br>Q    Do you think that this leak has irreparably changed the Court?  We’ve never seen this happen before.</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; You know, if &#8212; if this decision holds, it’s really quite a radical decision.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, again, the underlying premise &#8212; and, again, I’ve not had a chance to thoroughly go into the report &#8212; the decision.&nbsp; But it basically says all the decisions related to your private life &#8212; who you marry, whether or not you decide to conceive a child or not, whether or not you can have an abortion, a range of other decisions &#8212; whether or not &#8212; how you raise your child &#8212;</p>



<p>What does this do &#8212; and does this mean that in Florida they can decide they’re going to pass a law saying that same-sex marriage is not permissible, that it’s against the law in Florida?</p>



<p>And so, there’s a whole &#8212; it’s a fundamental shift in American jurisprudence if it were to hold.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. President, should the Senate do away with the filibuster to codify Roe?</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; I’m not &#8212; I’m not prepared to make those judgments now about &#8212; but, you know, I think the codification of Roe makes a lot of sense.</p>



<p>Look, think what Roe says.&nbsp; Roe says what all basic mainstream religions have historically concluded &#8212; that the right &#8212; that the existence of a human life and being is a question.&nbsp; Is it at the moment of conception?&nbsp; Is it six months?&nbsp; Is it six weeks?&nbsp; Is it &#8212; is it quickening, like Aquinas argued?&nbsp;</p>



<p>I mean, so the idea that we’re going to make a judgment that is going to say that no one can make the judgment to choose to abort a child based on a decision by the Supreme Court, I think, goes way overboard.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What does this mean for the midterms?&nbsp; What does this mean for the Democrats’ argument in the midterms?</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; I haven’t thought that through yet.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do changes need to be made to the Court in light of this, if this decision holds?</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; I beg your pardon?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do changes need to be made to the Court in light of this, if this decision holds?</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; We have to choose &#8212; I mean, look, one of the reasons why I voted against a number of the members of the Court: They refuse to acknowledge that there’s a 9th Amendment.&nbsp; They refuse to acknowledge there’s a right to privacy.</p>



<p>I mean, there are so many fundamental rights that are affected by that.&nbsp; And I’m not allo- &#8212; I’m not prepared to leave that to the whims and the &#8212; and the &#8212; of the public at the moment in local areas.</p>



<p>Thank you so much.</p>
