<p>11:14 A.M. EDT<br><br>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Good morning, everyone.&nbsp; Good morning.&nbsp; You know, it&#8217;s so wonderful &#8212; we all love homecomings, don&#8217;t we?&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; And this is a homecoming for me to be on this stage at Cramton Auditorium at Howard University.<br><br>Dr. Frederick, I want to thank you for always warmly welcoming us to this incredible place.&nbsp; In this very auditorium, I have memories of so many moments in my life, including the day that I was here in the back of the room for freshman orientation.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; And in many ways, including my family, this is where it all started.<br><br>So, thank you, all, very much.&nbsp; It&#8217;s wonderful to be here with you all today.<br><br>Ellis Carr, thank you for that introduction and for your extraordinary leadership.&nbsp; We had some time, all of us, backstage to talk about the work that you all are doing, and I cannot thank you enough.<br><br>And Wayne Frederick, I want to just thank you again for all that you do to lead this venerable institution.&nbsp; You know, there&#8217;s so much about Howard University and all of our universities, our colleges, our community colleges that really do highlight what this is about, what this topic is about &#8212; which is creating a place and an environment where the talent of our nation can be nurtured and supported and encouraged.<br><br>That really is the essence of what we&#8217;re doing today, and that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re talking about today.<br><br>And this, of course, is an institution that since its founding, has worked to advance &#8212; as we are doing, all of us, today &#8212; inclusion, growth, and equity in our country.<br><br>Today, we are, of course, joined by the Secretary of Commerce, Gina Raimondo &#8212; thank you for your work, Madam Secretary; and the Administrator of our Small Business Administration, Isabel Guzman.&nbsp; And thank you.&nbsp; You know, I&#8217;ve known Isabel&#8217;s work &#8212; I&#8217;m going to say the Administrator&#8217;s work since her work in California, and you have a longstanding track record of supporting and encouraging community strength and growth.&nbsp; And so, I thank you for that.<br><br>And we are, of course, honored to be joined as well by a number of extraordinary leaders from the Greater Washington Partnership &#8212; leaders who have dedicated themselves to advancing economic development and economic opportunity for all our communities.<br><br>So, thank you all for your leadership and for being here today.<br><br>I believe America is a nation that is driven by the ambition and aspirations of her people.&nbsp; And our economy, to a great extent, therefore is driven by the ambition and aspiration of our small businesses.<br><br>Small-business owners work morning and night to transform an idea into a reality.&nbsp; And that energy, of course, drives our entire nation forward.&nbsp; It creates jobs.&nbsp; It drives innovation.&nbsp; It accelerates economic growth.<br><br>And in America today, too many small businesses and too many entrepreneurs are also being left behind.<br><br>So, to start and grow a business, as we all know, entrepreneurs with these incredible ideas, with ambition and aspiration &#8212; well, to actually put it into effect, they need capital.&nbsp; Capital to buy inventory, to rent a storefront, to pay their employees.&nbsp; They need financial services to help run the daily operations of their business and to invest in the future.<br><br>But far too many entrepreneurs are unable to access this essential support.<br><br>Consider: Black entrepreneurs are three times more likely to report that they did not apply for credit for fear of being turned away by a bank.<br><br>Black and Latino entrepreneurs are rejected at a much higher rate when applying for small-business loans from traditional financial institutions, even when they have credit profiles similar to other applicants.<br><br>People who live in rural areas, including many Native Americans, often lack access to traditional banking services of any kind.<br><br>And many Asian American business owners, in particular immigrant business owners, face language barriers that limit their opportunity and ability to access capital and banking services.&nbsp;<br><br>And let us acknowledge that when we think of the importance, the relevance, and the strength of traditional banks, we must also acknowledge that they’ve not always necessarily seen the vision of small-business owners who are women, small-business owners of color, rural small-business owners, and small-business owners who serve low-income communities.<br><br>Community lenders, on the other hand, were created to see that vision.&nbsp; Community lenders, known as CDFIs and MDIs, predominantly serve overlooked and underserved communities.<br><br>The people who run these institutions &#8212; and here’s where the magic lies &#8212; the people, Senator, who run these institutions &#8212; because we’ve worked together; Senator Cardin is right here in the front row &#8212; often live and work in those communities.<br><br>I’m going to repeat that: The people who run these institutions often live and work in those very communities.&nbsp; They know the people they are lending too.&nbsp; They understand their needs and their challenges and their strengths.&nbsp; And so, when they make a loan, they personally feel the positive impact of that loan.&nbsp; They feel it firsthand because they’re there. And so, community lenders can often see the potential that others might overlook.<br><br>Last year, for example &#8212; and I’ve been traveling the country meeting with our incredible small-business owners, but I’ll share with you one story because it is also in the place where I was born: Oakland, California. &nbsp;<br><br>But, last year, I met with a small-business owner.&nbsp; Her name is Reign, and she owns a catering company in Oakland, California.&nbsp; And when she started out &#8212; she was telling me about how she needed a van.&nbsp; And so, she went to a traditional bank and filled out an application for a loan, and she was rejected.<br><br>And she told me about a word that she heard then that I have heard many small-business owners tell me they were presented with as something that was supposed to describe themselves that they had never heard before.&nbsp; That word is “unbankable.”&nbsp; I’ve heard so many small-business owners tell me they were told, as though this is their identity, that they were “unbankable.”<br><br>So, Reign, not being deterred by a word &#8212; (laughter) &#8211;went to a community lender.&nbsp; And that lender, of course, saw her vision to build a catering company that made fresh, local, and sustainable food, cooked with love and served with care.&nbsp; And they, of course, gave Reign that loan to buy that van.<br><br>And, today, Reign runs one of the most successful catering businesses in Oakland.&nbsp; She has catered for clients from the mayor to the Golden State Warriors &#8212; yes &#8212; (laughs) &#8212; from Google to Stanford University.<br><br>So, Reign&#8217;s story is just one of so many.<br><br>Since I took office, I have consulted with some of the most active community lenders in our nation.&nbsp; And I have seen the tremendous difference that these lenders are making in communities across our country.<br><br>Latino communities in urban neighborhoods &#8212; like Columbia Heights, right here in Washington, D.C. &#8212; and rural communities across the country &#8212; like those in Oregon, like Native communities in South Dakota, and Black communities in the Mississippi Delta.&nbsp;<br><br>In fact, I’m heading to Mississippi on Friday to be with Bill Bynum.<br><br>Expanding our nation&#8217;s investment in community lenders has been a priority of mine and ours for years.&nbsp; In fact, when I was Senator, together my colleague, the great senator from Maryland, and so many others &#8212; we helped secure $12 billion for community lenders as part of a COVID-19 relief bill.<br><br>And now, with extraordinary partners such as the Secretary of the Treasury, Janet Yellen; Secretary Raimondo; Administrator Guzman, our administration is working to broaden the reach of community lenders.<br><br>And that brings me to one of the reasons that I’m here today, which is to share with you the development of all of this work.<br><br>In 2011, the Small Business Administration launched the Community Advantage pilot loan program.&nbsp; It was a pilot.&nbsp; Through this program, the SBA partially guarantees loans made by community lenders.<br><br>It allows community lenders to make more investments in underserved communities and to make entrepreneurs loans that others might have deemed too risky &#8212; entrepreneurs like Reign.<br><br>Since its founding, the Community Advantage program has helped launch businesses, create jobs, and drive innovation across our nation.&nbsp;<br><br>Originally, the program was scheduled to expire this fall.&nbsp; But today, I am proud to announce that we are extending the Community Advantage program until 2024.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; And we are expanding it so we will expand the number of lenders in the program and increase the amount of money that they can lend.&nbsp; So, this, of course, means that more small businesses will be able to benefit from the program.<br><br>And, of course, our work collectively is not going to stop there.&nbsp; Since the President and I took office, we have held roundtables, listening sessions, and one-on-one consultations with business owners and community leaners [sic] &#8212; leaders.&nbsp;<br><br>I was saying to the folks who are in the front row here that, you know, the experience that I&#8217;ve had, I know we all have, is, our small-business owners &#8212; they&#8217;re not only leaders in business: They are civic leaders.&nbsp; They are community leaders.&nbsp; They are the ones who sponsor the local softball league.&nbsp; They are the ones who mentor and hire people from the community.&nbsp; They&#8217;re the role models.&nbsp; Right?<br><br>So, when we talk about extending and expanding this program, all of that we have in mind.<br><br>And to better understand, then, how programs like these can serve our best communities, in terms of the best and the brightest, this is the work that we are doing.<br><br>And today, informed by all of those conversations, we are announcing a number of improvements also &#8212; because we heard from folks when we had these meetings &#8212; so, a number of improvements to the Community Advantage program.<br><br>So, for example, we are simplifying program requirements so lenders can devote more of their resources to serving their borrowers and spend less time on the paperwork.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s get rid of some of that bureaucracy.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; There&#8217;s the lender section.&nbsp; (Laughter.)<br><br>And we are updating program rules to allow those people who are borrowing to restructure their debt if they fall behind on payments.<br><br>You know, during the pandemic, community lenders demonstrated again and again how much good they do in their communities.&nbsp; So these reforms are intended to make it easier for more lenders to connect with more small businesses who need to borrow or make a loan.&nbsp; And this, of course, will unleash economic opportunity in communities around our country.<br><br>So, the bottom line is this: When small-business owners have the support they need, they create jobs.&nbsp; When small-business owners have the support they need, they drive innovation and inspire innovation.&nbsp; And they grow, as a result of all of that, our entire economy.<br><br>When we talk about how we are doing as a nation and the strength of our nation; and we look to, as a measure of that, the strength of our economy, then we must ask: How are our small businesses doing, and are we doing enough for them?<br><br>Because after all, the answer to all of that will lead us to also understanding: When they do well, it benefits us all.<br><br>And so, let us continue to all work together to address the inequities that stand in the way of the ambition and the aspirations of our communities.<br><br>Let us continue in the mission of encouraging the ambition and the aspiration.&nbsp; And that brings me, of course, before I conclude my comments, to the mission of the Greater Washington Partnership.<br><br>The $4.7 billion investment announced today, over $600 million of which will go to community lenders, is a major step forward not only for the Capital region and the people of this region, but, by example, the role modeling you are doing will benefit people around the country.<br><br>It is truly a model.&nbsp; And it is a model that can and should be replicated around our nation.<br><br>Our collective goal is to create an economy in which every person, wherever they live, has the opportunity to succeed and to thrive.<br><br>Thank you all very much.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; END&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>President Biden spoke today with President Zelenskyy of Ukraine about the ongoing work by the United States and its allies and partners to deliver military, economic, and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine and to impose severe costs on Russia for its brutal aggression against Ukraine. The leaders discussed how the United States is working around the clock to fulfill the main security assistance requests by Ukraine, the critical effects those weapons have had on the conflict, and continued efforts by the United States with allies and partners to identify additional capabilities to help the Ukrainian military defend its country. In addition, President Biden informed President Zelenskyy that the United States intends to provide the Ukrainian government with $500 million in direct budgetary aid. He also reviewed the additional sanctions and humanitarian assistance announced last week. President Zelenskyy updated President Biden on the status of Ukraine’s negotiations with Russia. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On April 1, 2015, by Executive Order 13694, the President declared a national emergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701&nbsp;<em>et seq.</em>) to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States constituted by the increasing prevalence and severity of malicious cyber‑enabled activities originating from, or directed by persons located, in whole or in substantial part, outside the United States.&nbsp; On December 28, 2016, the President issued Executive Order&nbsp;13757 to take additional steps to address the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13694.</p>



<p>These significant malicious cyber-enabled activities continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United&nbsp;States.&nbsp; For this reason, the national emergency declared on April 1, 2015, must continue in effect beyond April 1, 2022. &nbsp;Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1&nbsp;year the national emergency declared in Executive Order&nbsp;13694.</p>

<p>Today, the Biden Administration is launching COVID.gov, a new one-stop shop website to help all people in the United States gain even better access to lifesaving tools like vaccines, tests, treatments, and masks, as well as get the latest updates on COVID-19 in their area. The Administration has worked over the past 14 months to set up over 90,000 vaccination sites, make more than 400 million high-quality masks available for free, send free tests to peoples’ homes, and stand up new test-to-treat sites where people can get tested and receive life-saving antivirals all in one place. Now, with a click of a button, people will be able to find where to access all of these tools, as well as receive the latest CDC data on the level of COVID-19 in their community.</p>



<p>As part of COVID.gov, a new Test-to-Treat locator will help people access pharmacies and community health centers across the nation where people can get tested for COVID-19 and receive appropriate treatments if they need them. President Biden announced the Test-to-Treat initiative in his State of the Union address earlier this month. Since that time, the Administration has already launched over 2,000 of these sites, plus more than 240 sites across Veteran’s Health Administration and Department of Defense facilities to serve veterans, military personnel, and their families. As has been the case throughout the pandemic, the Administration is ensuring locations are established in our most hard-hit and high-risk communities.</p>



<p>Because of the lifesaving tools we now have, America is in a new moment in the pandemic. The country is moving forward safely and people are getting back to their more normal routines. To ensure we’re sustaining and building on this progress and protecting and preparing for new variants, earlier this month, the President released his&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/covidplan/">National COVID-19 Preparedness Plan</a>. The President was clear that in order to execute on this plan and to stay ahead of the virus, the Administration needs additional funding from Congress—including $22.5 billion in immediate emergency funds. To date, Congress has failed to provide those funds and the country is already suffering the consequences. In the last two weeks, the Administration has had to stop reimbursing health care providers for treating the uninsured, cancel monoclonal antibody orders and cut states’ supply, reduce orders of treatments for the immunocompromised, and pull the U.S. out of line for future vaccine and next-generation treatment purchases. These issues disproportionately impact our hardest-hit and highest-risk populations, including communities of color and individuals with disabilities. The Administration continues to urge Congress to act quickly, as the consequences will continue to get worse in the coming weeks.</p>



<p>Protecting the American people from COVID-19 now and into the future relies on affordable and accessible tools like vaccines, treatments, tests and high-quality masks. Through efforts like COVID.gov and Test-to-Treat, the Administration continues to take steps to make these tools even more readily available. Now, we need Congress to do its part and continue to fund the COVID-19 response.</p>



<p>Today’s announcements include:</p>



<p><strong><u>Launch of COVID.gov, A New One-Stop-Shop Website Where Individuals Can Find Where to Access Vaccines, Tests, Treatments, and High-Quality Masks.&nbsp;</u></strong>Today, the Administration launched COVID.gov, a new website to help people access vaccines, tests, treatments, and high-quality masks. COVID.gov also provides people an easy way to find the level of COVID-19 in their community. Early last year, the Administration launched Vaccines.gov and an associated call line to help people locate and make appointments at vaccine sites near them. In January of this year, the Administration launched COVIDTests.gov where people could order tests and have them shipped to their homes for free. COVID.gov will allow individuals to access both of these services at one convenient, easy-to-use website. It will also offer information about where to find free high-quality masks and, for the first time, where to access COVID-19 treatments.</p>



<p>COVID.gov will be available in English, Spanish, and Simplified Chinese and is accessible for those using assistive technologies. The Administration is also making all of these COVID-19 tools available over the phone through the National Hotline at 1-800-232-0233 (TTY 1-888-720-7489), which supports over 150 languages. For individuals with disabilities who may need additional support, the Disability Information and Access Line (DIAL) is also available to help at 1-888-677-1199 or via email at DIAL@usaginganddisability.org. <br><br><strong><u>New Locator Tool to Help Individuals Access the Over 2,000 Test-to-Treat Sites Across the Country.</u> </strong>Today, as part of COVID.gov, the Administration launched a new Test-to-Treat locator tool to help the public access lifesaving drugs if they are sick with COVID-19. President Biden announced in his State of the Union address the creation of the Test-to-Treat initiative. This program creates one-stop-shop locations where people can get a COVID-19 test and receive an oral antiviral treatment, if appropriate for them because they test positive and face high risks from COVID. Since the launch earlier this month, there are now over 2,000 Test-to-Treat locations nationwide, including in pharmacy-based clinics, federally-qualified community health centers (FQHCs), and long-term care facilities. As has been the case since December, people can still be tested and treated by their own health care providers who can appropriately prescribe these oral antivirals at locations where they are being distributed, now more easily identified than ever by the Test to Treat locator.  <br><br><a><strong><u>Test-to-Treat Available for All Patients in Veteran’s Health Administration and Military Personnel and Their Families.</u></strong></a> Test-to-Treat is now available for all Veterans Affairs (VA) patients in VA clinics across the country. Linking patients who test positive with treatments that are appropriate for them is the standard of care in VA clinics. Each test done in the VA is linked to a care team, and accompanied by review, patient counseling, and consideration for treatment indication and eligibility. The VA also allows individuals with a positive home test result to have a virtual visit to connect with counseling and to receive oral medication if appropriate. VA sites have access to oral antiviral treatments for COVID-19, and treatment generally is provided on site or delivered via expedited mail. In addition, the Department of Defense (DoD) has made one-stop Test-to-Treat available at more than 60 DoD Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) across the country, with hundreds more primed to start operating soon. MTF patients across the country—including active duty service members and TRICARE beneficiaries—can access Test-to-Treat at facilities in their communities. </p>



<p><strong>Hundreds of Test-to-Treat Locations in FQHCs and Indian Health Service Facilities Across the Country to Protect Hard-Hit and High-Risk Communities from COVID-19.</strong><a>Test-to-Treat locations also are available in more than 240 FQHCs and Indian Health Service (IHS) Facilities across the country, ensuring access to lifesaving treatments in some of our hardest-hit and highest-risk communities. </a>The number of these locations will continue to grow in the coming weeks, as more and more FQHCs, Rural Health Clinics, and IHS locations come online with Test-to-Treat programs. These community providers will continue to serve as trusted messengers in raising awareness about the availability of lifesaving treatments, and also partner with community-based organizations to reach specific high-risk populations, including individuals with disabilities.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Rose Garden</p>



<p>4:11 P.M. EDT</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; (The bill is signed.)&nbsp; All right.&nbsp; It’s law.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>(The President moves to the podium.)</p>



<p>Thank you.&nbsp; It’s a little unusual to do the bill signing, not say anything and then speak, but that’s how we set it up.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Well, ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon.&nbsp; I just signed into law the Emmett Till Antilynching Act, making lynching &#8212; (applause) &#8212; a federal hate crime for the first time in American history.</p>



<p>I want to thank Vice President Harris who was a key co-sponsor of this bill when she was a United States senator.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>And I also want to thank Speaker Pelosi and Leader Schumer and members of the Congress here today, especially Congressman Hoyer and Bobby Rush, Senator Dick Durbin and Cory Booker.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; I &#8212; I also want to thank Senator Tim Scott, who couldn’t be here today.</p>



<p>And the civil rights leaders gathered here today and, most of all, the family of Emmett Till and Ida B. Wells: Thank you for never giving up.  Never, ever giving up.  (Applause.)</p>



<p>Matter of fact, her [great]-granddaughter told me that her mother was here &#8212; when? &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. DUSTER:&nbsp; (Inaudible.)</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; &#8212; I mean, your [great]-grandmother was here &#8212; when? &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. DUSTER:&nbsp; It was in 1898.</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; In 1898, in order to make a case for the antilynching law.&nbsp; It was over 100 years ago, in 1900, when a North Carolina Representative named George Henry White &#8212; the son of a slave; the only Black lawmaker in Congress at the time &#8212; who first introduced legislation to make lynching a federal crime.</p>



<p>Hundreds &#8212; hundreds of similar bills have failed to pass.</p>



<p>Over the years, several federal hate crime laws were enacted, including one I signed last year to combat COVID-19 hate crimes.&nbsp; But no federal law &#8212; no federal law expressly prohibited lynching.&nbsp; None.&nbsp; Until today.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>One of the leading chronicles of our history of lynching is Bryan Stevenson, who happens to be a Delawarean from my home state, who wanted very much to be here today but he could not.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He helped build the National Memorial for Peace and Justice in Montgomery, Alabama &#8212; America’s first site dedicated to understanding the legacy of lynching.</p>



<p>You know, his extensive research showed that between 1877 and 1950, more than 4,400 Black people were murdered by lynching, most in the South but some in the North as well.&nbsp; That’s a lot of folks, man, and a lot of silence for a long time.</p>



<p>Lynching was pure terror to enforce the lie that not everyone &#8212; not everyone belongs in America and not everyone is created equal; terror to systematically undermine hard &#8212; hard-fought civil rights; terror not just in the dark of the night</p>



<p>but in broad daylight.</p>



<p>Innocent men, women, and children hung by nooses from trees.&nbsp; Bodies burned and drowned and castrated.</p>



<p>Their crimes?&nbsp; Trying to vote.&nbsp; Trying to go to school.&nbsp; To try and own a business or preach the Gospel.&nbsp; False accusations of murder, arson, and robbery.&nbsp; Simply being Black.</p>



<p>Often the crowds of white families gathered to celebrate the spectacle, taking pictures of the bodies and mailing them as postcards.</p>



<p>Emmett Till was an only child.&nbsp; He grew up on the South Side of Chicago with his mother, Mamie, and grandparents and cousins.</p>



<p>In the summer of 1955, Emmett turned 14 years old, ready to start eighth grade in the fall.&nbsp; Before school started, he wanted to visit his cousins in Mississippi.&nbsp; So Emmett’s mom dropped him off at the train station in Chicago.&nbsp; Her own family fled the Delta decades earlier, so she told him &#8212; she told him the unwritten rules he had to follow.&nbsp; Quote, “Be very careful how you speak.&nbsp; Say ‘yes sir’ and ‘no ma’am’, and do not hesitate to be &#8212; to humble yourself if you have to get down on your knees”.&nbsp; End of quote.</p>



<p>That same speech, that same admonition &#8212; too many Black parents today still have to use that admonition.&nbsp; They have to tell their children when it comes to encounters with the law enforcement.&nbsp; You know, and so many other circumstances.</p>



<p>She kissed Emmett goodbye.&nbsp; It was the last time she saw her son alive.</p>



<p>Days after he arrived in Mississippi, Emmett’s mutilated body was found in a river, barbed wire tied around his neck and a 75-pound cotton gin fan attached to that wire as he was thrown into the river.</p>



<p>Emmett’s mother &#8212; his mother demanded that her son be sent home so that his funeral in Chicago could be an open casket.</p>



<p>Here’s what she said: “Let the people see what I’ve seen.”&nbsp; America and the world saw what she saw.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Emmett Till was born nearly 40 years ago after the first antilynching law was introduced.&nbsp; Although he was one of thousands who were lynched, his mother courage &#8212; his mother’s courage to show the world what was done to him energized the Civil Rights Movement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Exactly 100 days later, Rosa Parks was arrested on the bus in Montgomery.&nbsp; Her statue sits in my office.&nbsp; She said, “I thought of Emmett Till and I couldn’t go back.”&nbsp; “I thought of Emmett Till and I couldn’t go back.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. King often preached about, quote, “the crying voices of little Emmett Till, screaming from the rushes of the Mississippi.”</p>



<p>To the Till family: We remain in awe of your courage to find purpose through your pain.&nbsp; To find purpose to through your pain.&nbsp; But the law is not just about the past, it’s about the present and our future as well.</p>



<p>From the bullets in the back of Ahmaud Arbery to countless other acts of violence &#8212; countless victims known and unknown &#8212; the same racial hatred that drove the mob to hang a noose brought that mob carrying torches out of the fields of Charlottesville just a few years go.</p>



<p>Racial hate isn’t an old problem; it’s a persistent problem.&nbsp; A persistent problem.&nbsp; And I know many of the civil rights leaders here know, and you heard me say it a hundred times: Hate never goes away; it only hides.&nbsp; It hides under the rocks.&nbsp; And given just a little bit of oxygen, it comes roaring back out, screaming.&nbsp; But what stops it is all of us, not a few.&nbsp; All of us have to stop it.</p>



<p>People like Ida B. Wells, one of the founders of the NAACP, established 100 years ago in response to racial terror across the country.&nbsp; A brilliant, gifted writer, she exposed the barbaric nature of lyn- &#8212; of lynching as a tool to intimidate and subjugate Black Americans.</p>



<p>And her words, her courage, her convictions &#8212; she was trying to prevent the murders of Emmett Till and Ahmaud Arbery, and so many others &#8212; over 4,400 others.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ida B. &#8212; Ida B. Wells once said, quote, “The way to right wrongs is to turn the light of truth upon the wrongs.”&nbsp; “Turn the light of truth upon the wrongs.”</p>



<p>That’s what all of you have done, gathered in this Rose Garden, with this bill and so much more, including Ida B. Wells’s great-granddaughter, Michelle Duster, whom I&#8217;m honored to introduce to mark this historic day.</p>



<p>Michelle, welcome to the White House, and welcome to the podium.&nbsp; And as my mother would say: God love you, dear.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Oval Office</p>



<p>11:26 A.M. EDT</p>



<p>PRESIDENT BIDEN:&nbsp; Well, Prime Minister, it’s great to have you back.&nbsp; We’ve &#8212;</p>



<p>PRIME MINISTER LEE:&nbsp; Happy to be here.&nbsp;</p>



<p>PRESIDENT BIDEN:&nbsp; &#8212; spent a fair amount of time together.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is a critical moment for, I think, both our countries and the region that you so ably represent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And the strength of the U.S.- &#8212; it seems to me, at least; I hope you think the same way &#8212; the Singapore Strategic Partnership for peace and &#8212; and prosperity throughout the Pacific these many years: Today, that partnership is as important as it’s ever been, in my opinion.&nbsp; As a matter of a fact, I think it’s growing in importance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And a rule-based order is facing unprecedented challenges.&nbsp; Russia’s unprovoked and unjustifiable war against Ukraine is an urgent threat to both Europe and, I believe, to the Indo-Pacific as well.&nbsp; And it’s attacking the core tenets of a rule-based international order.&nbsp; And the borders can&#8217;t be changed by force.&nbsp; And all the nations, large and small, are equal in sovereign &#8212; in rights for their sovereignty.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I want to thank you, Mr. Prime Minister, for Singapore&#8217;s principled leadership in supporting the people of Ukraine.&nbsp; I know it&#8217;s not easy, but I want to thank you for it.&nbsp; You’re a man of principle, and you’ve stepped up every time you&#8217;ve had to.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And even as we address the crisis in Europe, my administration is strongly supportive of moving rapidly to implement the Indo-Pacific Strategy that we&#8217;ve talked about, as you know.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And the United States is a proud Indo-Pacific nation.&nbsp; It&#8217;s hard for most other nations of the world to understand that, but we have a big country and a lot of Pacific territory.&nbsp; And I &#8212; it&#8217;s a free and open area that we want to make sure is &#8212; we want to maintain it that way and connect it in purpose and security and in terms of our resilience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so, today, at the end of the day, we&#8217;re going to discuss a number of important issues: the U.S.-ASEAN relationship, upholding freedom of the seas, promoting the return of democracy in Burma, and advancing an inclusive and sustainable economic growth in both our areas.</p>



<p>And so I want to thank you, again, for making this journey.  And, Mr. Prime Minister, the floor is yours, good friend.<br><br>     PRIME MINISTER LEE:  Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you, especially, for receiving me at this critical moment in &#8212; in world affairs.  And I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re completely seized with what&#8217;s happening in Europe right now.  But we doubly appreciate the time you are giving to the relationship with Singapore and the Southeast Asian countries generally, especially ASEAN.<br><br>     Singapore is a very good partner of the United States.  We are a major security cooperation partner of the U.S.  And our relations are doing very well economically, as well as in the security and defense realms, and they prosper and grow and venture into new areas continuously. <br><br>     And I hope to discuss that with the President today, as well as to further the relationship between the U.S. and ASEAN, which is an engagement which is important to the U.S. because it helps the U.S. to be present in the Asia-Pacific and to deepen its relations with many friends and to strengthen its strategic interest in the region.<br><br>     We will, of course, exchange views also on Ukraine and what that means for the Asia-Pacific region. <br><br>     Singapore hopes that the United States, amidst all its many preoccupations, will continue to deepen its relationship with countries in the Asia-Pacific &#8212; China, certainly, but also other countries besides China &#8212; and deepen it substantially in many different ways through the Indo-Pacific Strategy and, in doing so, to foster the peace, stability, and security of the region as you have done for so many decades since the war. <br><br>     Thank you very much.<br><br>     PRESIDENT BIDEN:  I assure you that’s our objective.  I assure you.<br><br>     PRIME MINISTER LEE:  Thank you.<br><br>     PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Thank you all.<br><br>11:30 A.M. EDT</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Invests $2.7 Billion from President’s Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to Strengthen Port and Waterway Supply Chains and Climate Resilience</em><br> <br><em>Department of the Interior Invests $1.7 billion in Rural Infrastructure for FY 2023</em></p>



<p>Recognizing the vital role of modern, resilient infrastructure in reducing costs for American families and businesses, President Biden secured unprecedented investments through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to improve the country’s ports and waterways – critical links in our supply chains. President Biden’s infrastructure law provides the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers investments to modernize ports and waterways after decades of neglect. The funding will not only make them more resilient to climate change impacts, but strengthens supply chains, keeps goods moving through the economy, and enables the U.S. to compete.<br><br><strong>Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing that it will invest more than $2.7 billion in funding to [300] Army Corps projects through the country focused on strengthening ports and waterways. </strong>The announcement follows the Biden Administration providing $14 billion from President’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and other appropriations to strengthen port and waterway supply chains and bolster climate resilience earlier this year. With today’s announcement, the Biden Administration will have invested a total of nearly $17 billion in new Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding and other supplemental appropriations in fiscal year 2022 and 2023 for over 800 projects across 55 states and territories.<br><br>These key projects will strengthen the nation’s supply chain, provide significant new economic opportunities nationwide, and bolster our defenses against climate change, including investments for:</p>



<ul><li>The<strong> Upper Ohio River, Pennsylvania </strong>to construct new lock chambers at Emsworth Locks and Dams that will allow large cargo ships to reliably and efficiently pass through the upper Ohio River system, relieving landside congestion and facilitating timely delivery of goods.<br></li><li>The <strong>McClellan–Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System (MKARNS)</strong> which moves 12 million tons of agricultural commodities annually in commodities to American farmers and provides flood control to many communities in Arkansas and Oklahoma along the Mississippi River.<br></li><li><strong>Adams and Denver, Colorado</strong> for reducing flood risk and an aquatic ecosystem restoration project, which will serve disadvantaged communities surrounding the area.<br></li><li>A project in the <strong>City of Watsonville, Town of Pajaro, California </strong>and surrounding agricultural lands which have been subject to a long history of flooding.</li></ul>



<p>Additionally, today, the Department of the Interior announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding allocations by the Bureau of Reclamation for nearly $1.7 billion in rural infrastructure funding for FY 2023. The plan represents a blueprint for how Reclamation is investing in communities to address drought across the West, as well as greater water infrastructure throughout the country. The Infrastructure Law’s second year funding will be allocated to a number of priorities including:</p>



<ul><li>$649 million for the Aging Infrastructure Account for major repairs and rehabilitation of facilities;<br></li><li>$248 million for rural water projects that benefit various Tribal and non-Tribal underserved communities by increasing access to potable water;<br></li><li>$95 million for construction of water storage, groundwater storage and conveyance project infrastructure; and<br></li><li>$85 million for the St. Mary Canal diversion and headworks replacement project, which&nbsp; will include a large fish bypass structure.</li></ul>



<p>The investments announced today further advance the President’s Justice40 Initiative commitment to ensure that 40 percent of the overall benefits of certain Federal investments, including in the areas of climate change and critical clean water and wastewater infrastructure, flow to historically marginalized, underserved, and overburdened communities to build their economies&nbsp;and reduce their disproportionate environmental burden. The investments also underscore how President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/01/14/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-hits-the-ground-running-60-days-into-infrastructure-implementation/">delivering results</a> to communities across America, advancing racial equity, combatting climate change, and creating job opportunities for American workers.<br><br>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will initiate projects in fiscal years 2022 and 2023 that:<br><strong><br>STRENGTHEN DOMESTIC SUPPLY CHAINS&nbsp;<br></strong><br>American ports and waterways are a cornerstone of the U.S. economy. According to the 2021 Report Card for America’s Infrastructure Report issued by the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE), in 2018, America’s ports supported more than 30 million jobs and approximately 26% of our nation’s GDP. However, decades of neglect and underinvestment have strained their capacity and jeopardized supply chains.<br><br>Building on the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/10/13/fact-sheet-biden-administration-efforts-to-address-bottlenecks-at-ports-of-los-angeles-and-long-beach-moving-goods-from-ship-to-shelf/">work</a> this Administration has done this past year to get goods flowing from ships to shelves faster, including $6.6 billion in funding announced through the fiscal year 2023 Budget, today the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is committing $321 million through the President’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to expand capacity at key ports and waterways to allow passage of larger vessels and further enhance the country’s ability to move goods. These waterside investments will compliment landside investments at our ports and across the goods movement chain such as the Port Infrastructure Development Grants announced in December. Specific projects announced today work to:<br><br><strong>Move More Goods Faster at One of the Nation’s Fastest Growing Ports:&nbsp;</strong>Investing in ports helps to create resilient supply chains and create jobs. The Administration will invest more than $72 million to widen and deepen the <strong>Norfolk Harbor, Virginia</strong> Federal navigation channel to increase the resilience of our nation&#8217;s supply chain.&nbsp; The Norfolk Harbor, Virginia, project handles 67 percent more containers in 2021 than it did 10 years ago. Work will improve navigation and enable safer access for larger commercial and naval vessels, and provide significant new economic opportunities to the region.<br><br>The Biden Administration is also investing nearly $11 million in the <strong>Port of Galveston in Texas</strong> by deepening a portion of the Galveston Harbor Channel to accommodate larger vessels throughout the Port that will increase capacity, while also enabling improved operational safety.<br><br>Further, the $68 million investment to deepen the <strong>Brazos Island Harbor Channel at the Port of Brownsville</strong><strong>in Texas</strong> will enable increased cargo movements, reduced transit times and improved operational safety.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Reduce Congestion on Inland Waterways</strong>. Investing in inland waterways creates and sustains jobs, relieves landside congestion, and provides more cost-effective transportation capacities. Recognizing the diverse benefits provided by investing in inland waterways, today, the Biden Administration is announcing it will invest an additional $77 million in the <strong>Upper Ohio River, Pennsylvania</strong> project to construct new lock chambers at Emsworth Locks and Dams that will allow large cargo ships to reliably and efficiently pass through the upper Ohio River system, relieving landside congestion and facilitating timely delivery of goods.<br><br>The Biden Administration is also investing $92.6 million in the <strong>McClellan–Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System</strong> (<strong>MKARNS</strong>) which moves 12 million tons of agricultural commodities annually in commodities to American farmers and provides flood control to many communities in Arkansas and Oklahoma along the Mississippi River. The investment will upgrade the locks along the system to ensure that much needed commodities are being delivered quickly and efficiently.<br><br><strong>BOLSTER RESILIENCE TO CLIMATE CHANGE</strong><br><br>The Biden-Harris Administration is leveraging the <strong>$17 billion</strong> provided by the President’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law through fiscal year 2024 to better protect communities from climate change, and protect vital ecosystems and the people and businesses throughout the country that rely on them. Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing more than $1.16 billion in invests to reduce coastal and inland flood risk.</p>



<p>Funding from the President’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law announced today will:<br><strong>Reduce Flood Risk and Restore Aquatic Ecosystems</strong>. The Army Corps will leverage funds from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to increase community resilience to flooding, including nearly $[482] million to reduce coastal flood risk through 12 projects and more than $[679] million to reduce inland flood risk through an additional 7 projects across the country.&nbsp; Projects include:</p>



<ul><li>$350 million to the <strong>Adams and Denver, Colorado</strong> for flood risk reduction and aquatic ecosystem restoration project, which will serve disadvantaged communities surrounding the area. Components of the project include ecosystem restoration for aquatic, wetland, and riparian habitat along 6.5 miles of the South Platte River, restoring critical habitat connectivity as well as providing recreational opportunities to underserved populations.&nbsp;<br></li><li>$220 million for the <strong>Howard Hanson Dam, WA</strong> to maintain flood risk management, increase municipal and industrial water supply to Tacoma Public Utility, and ecosystem restoration. The funding will advance work on the fish passage facility for migrating juvenile salmon and maintain dam performance to support the primary water needs for the citizens of Tacoma.&nbsp;<br></li><li>$150 million for floodwalls, storm surge barriers, levees, pump stations, and non-structural measures to reduce threats from seal-level rise and increasing storm risk to the City of <strong>Norfolk, Virginia</strong>. This project will reduce threats from ever-increasing storms and sea-level rise, and damages to residential, commercial, historic and critical infrastructure.<br></li><li>$77 million for <strong>Mississippi Coastal Improvement Program</strong> (MSCIP) to restore the Mississippi barrier islands to increase resilience to future storm events prevent saltwater intrusion and shoreline erosion, and preserve fish and wildlife habitat. The funding will advance the next phase of the project.<br></li><li>$26 million for <strong>Hudson Raritan Estuary</strong> to restore 381 acres of estuarine wetland habitat including 16 acres of tidal channels, 50 acres of freshwater riverine wetland habitat, 27 acres of coastal and maritime forest habitat, 39 acres of shallow water habitat and 53 acres of oyster habitat.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p><strong>ADVANCE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE</strong><br><br>The investments announced today will further deliver on the President’s Justice40 Initiative commitment to ensure that 40 percent of the overall benefits from certain federal investments, including in the areas of climate change and critical clean water and wastewater infrastructure, flow to disadvantaged communities in building their local economies and reducing their disproportionate environmental burden.&nbsp;In addition to the projects mentioned above, the followings projects are examples of projects that will provide benefits to disadvantaged communities. The Administration will provide $115 million to the <strong>Southwest Coastal Louisiana Hurricane Protection project</strong>&nbsp;which will construct localized storm surge risk reduction features, including features to elevate and flood-proof structures, to reduce hurricane storm surge damage risks in Cameron, Calcasieu, and Vermilion Parishes, communities which are identified as disadvantaged and have been particularly hard hit by the effects of climate change.</p>



<p>In addition, the Administration will provide $67 million to the Pajaro, CA project to reduce flood risk in the <strong>City of Watsonville, Town of Pajaro</strong>, and surrounding agricultural lands which have been subject to a long history of flooding.</p>



<p>The Administration is also committed to the <strong>Espanola Valley, Rio Grande and Tributaries, New Mexico</strong> project by providing $2.2 million to complete the preconstruction engineering and design to restore and protect 958 acres of aquatic and riparian habitats. These habitats are critical to the functioning of the third longest river in the country, and are an integral part of constructing social identity and transmission and retention of traditional knowledge for both the Pueblo of Santa Clara and Ohkay Owingeh.</p>
