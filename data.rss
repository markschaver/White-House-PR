<p class="has-text-align-center">South Court Auditorium<br>Eisenhower Executive Office Building</p>



<p>6:13 P.M. EDT</p>



<p><br>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Well, good evening, everyone.&nbsp; I am very honored to be with you all.&nbsp;</p>



<p>President Joe Biden and I talk often about our mutual passion for everything you all do.&nbsp; This is a very exciting moment to join you for the unveiling of the work that you have been laboring on for decades.</p>



<p>So, to our President, Joe Biden, thank you for your leadership around all of these issues.&nbsp; Our NASA Administrator, Bill Nelson, and the Office of Science and Technology Policy Acting Director, Dr. Alondra Nelson.</p>



<p>Thank you also to our colleagues from across the White House and NASA and everyone else joining us from home.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, yes, as Chair of the National Space Council, I know that today represents an exciting new chapter in the exploration of our universe.&nbsp; From the beginning of history, humans have looked up to the night sky with wonder.&nbsp; And thanks to dedicated people who have been working for decades in engineering and on scientific marvels, we can look to the sky with new understanding.</p>



<p>When NASA launched the Hubble Space Telescope in 1990, we were able to see the stars unobstructed by the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere and understand the universe in ways we could have never imagined even a few decades earlier.</p>



<p>And now we enter a new phase of scientific discovery.&nbsp; Building on the legacy of Hubble, the James Webb Space Telescope allows us to see deeper into space than ever before and in stunning clarity.&nbsp; It will enhance what we know about the origins of our universe, our solar system, and possibly life itself.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This was made possible by partnership among nations.&nbsp; And it is an example of how the scientific endeavor can build upon the international rules and norms that govern our cooperation in space.</p>



<p>This telescope is one of humanity&#8217;s great engineering achievements.&nbsp; And the images we will see today are a testament to the amazing work done by the thousands of workers across our nation who dedicated years to this project.&nbsp; They embarked on this complex endeavor for the benefit of humankind, and in the process, accelerated American innovation, strengthened partnerships with our allies, and will undoubtedly inspire generations to look to the heavens with excitement and ambition.</p>



<p>With that, it is my great honor to introduce a leader who has always believed in the power of American innovation and international cooperation to achieve the remarkable: our President, the President of the United States, Joe Biden.&nbsp;</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Well, it&#8217;s great to be with you all.&nbsp; And I was going to say “good afternoon,” but we&#8217;re starting this meeting late because I was engaged in preparing for a trip to the Middle East.</p>



<p>But today is a historic day.&nbsp; And thank you, Vice President Harris, Chair of the National Space Council.&nbsp; And thank you, my dear friend and our outstanding NASA Administrator and the guy&nbsp;&#8212; the only guy here who’s been in space, Bill Nelson.&nbsp; Bill, you&#8217;re a good friend.&nbsp; Thank you very much for what you&#8217;re doing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And &#8212; and, Dr. Nelson, you&#8217;re doing a great job leading this Office of Science and Technology Policy.&nbsp; It really is a matter &#8212; it really is amazing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Six and a half months ago, a rocket launched from Earth carrying the world’s newest, most powerful deep-space telescope on a journey one million miles into the cosmos &#8212; first of all, that blows my mind: a million miles into the cosmos &#8212; along the way unfolding itself<a>, deploying a mirror 21 feet wide, a sunshield the size of a tennis court, and 250,000 tiny shutters</a>, each one smaller than a grain of sand.</p>



<p>Put together, it’s a new window into the history of our universe.</p>



<p>And today, we’re going to get a glimpse of the first light to shine through that window &#8212; light from other worlds, orbiting stars far beyond our own.&nbsp; It’s astounding to me when I read this and saw the &#8212; I mean, it really is.&nbsp; It’s &#8212; it’s &#8212; anyway, I don’t want to &#8212; I’ll see what they think when we see this.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But light where stars were born and from where they die.&nbsp; Light from the oldest galaxies.&nbsp; The oldest documented light in the history of the universe from over 13 billion &#8212; let me say that again: 13 billion years ago.&nbsp; It’s hard to even fathom.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tomorrow, when this image is shared with the world, it will be a historic moment for science and technology, for astronomy and space exploration, for America and all of humanity.</p>



<p>You know, as an international collaboration, this telescope embodies how America leads the world not by the example of our power, but the power of our example.&nbsp; A partnership with others, it symbolizes the relentless spirit of American ingenuity.&nbsp;&nbsp; And it shows what we can achieve, what more we can discover, not just about distant places, but about our very own planet and climate, like NASA’s Earth System Observatory that we launched last year.</p>



<p>That’s why the federal government must invest &#8212; must invest in science and technology, more than we have in the past.</p>



<p>These images are going to remind the world that America can do big things.&nbsp;&nbsp;And they’ll remind the American people, especially our children, that there’s nothing beyond our capacity &#8212; nothing beyond our capacity.</p>



<p>We can see possibilities no one has ever seen before.&nbsp; We can go places no one has ever gone before.&nbsp; You know, you’ve &#8212; you’ve heard me say it over and over again.&nbsp; America is defined by one single word: possibilities.&nbsp; Possibilities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I want to thank the team at NASA for once again showing that that’s who we are &#8212; that’s who we are as a nation: a nation of possibilities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And now let&#8217;s take a look at the very first image from this miraculous telescope.&nbsp;</p>



<p>(The image is displayed.)&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>NASA Administrator Nelson, I&#8217;m going to turn this over to you.&nbsp; So will you please tell us about what we’re seeing?</p>



<p>ADMINISTRATOR NELSON:&nbsp; Mr. President, if you held a grain of sand on the tip of your finger at arm&#8217;s length, that is the part of the universe that you&#8217;re seeing &#8212; just one little speck of the universe.&nbsp; And what you&#8217;re seeing there are galaxies.&nbsp; You&#8217;re seeing galaxies that are shining around other galaxies whose light has been bent.&nbsp; And you&#8217;re seeing just a small little portion of the universe.<br><br>You know, 100 years ago, Mr. President, Madam Vice President &#8212; 100 years ago, we thought there was only one galaxy.&nbsp; Now, the number is unlimited.&nbsp; And in our galaxy, we have billions of stars, or suns.&nbsp; And there are billions of galaxies with billions of stars and suns.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re getting our first glimpse.<br><br>As you said, Mr. President, we&#8217;re looking back more than 13 billion years.&nbsp; Light travels at 186,000 miles per second.&nbsp; And that light that you are seeing on one of those little specks has been traveling for over 13 billion years.<br><br>And, by the way, we&#8217;re going back further, because this is just the first image.&nbsp; They&#8217;re going back about 13.5 billion years.&nbsp; And since we know the universe is 13.8 billion years old, we&#8217;re going back almost to the beginning.<br><br>That is the discovery that we are making with this.&nbsp;<br><br>There&#8217;s another thing that you&#8217;re going to find with this telescope: It is going to be so precise, you&#8217;re going to see whether or not planets, because of the chemical composition that we can determine with this telescope of their atmosphere, if those planets are habitable.<br><br>And when you look at something as big as this is, we are going to be able to answer questions that we don&#8217;t even know what the questions are yet.<br><br>This is what&#8217;s happening, and it&#8217;s because of this wonderful team that&#8217;s out here, part of that team led by Thomas Zurbuchen.&nbsp; It was in trouble financially five years ago.&nbsp; He took it over.&nbsp; He got Greg Robinson, that you&#8217;re going to meet, to direct it.&nbsp; And the result is what you&#8217;ve seen.<br><br>So, what an incredible team &#8212; joined, by the way, with our international partners, the European Space Agency and the Canadian Space Agency.&nbsp; So this is an international endeavor.</p>



<p><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; It&#8217;s amazing.&nbsp; I wonder what the press is like in those other places.</p>

<p>Dear Madam Speaker: (Dear Madam President:)</p>



<p>Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, within 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President publishes in the <em>Federal Register</em> and transmits to the Congress a notice stating that the&nbsp;emergency is to continue in effect beyond the anniversary date.&nbsp; In accordance with this provision, I have sent to the <em>Federal Register</em> for publication the enclosed notice stating that the national emergency with respect to Hong Kong that was&nbsp;declared in Executive Order 13936 of July 14, 2020, is to&nbsp;continue&nbsp;in&nbsp;effect beyond July 14, 2022.</p>



<p>The situation with respect to Hong Kong, including recent actions taken by the People&#8217;s Republic of China to fundamentally undermine Hong Kong&#8217;s autonomy, continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat, which has its source in substantial part outside the United States, to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.&nbsp; Therefore, I have determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13936 with respect to the&nbsp;situation in Hong Kong.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-right">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sincerely,</p>

<p>On July 14, 2020, by Executive Order 13936, the President declared a national emergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50&nbsp;U.S.C. 1701 <em>et seq.</em>) to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United&nbsp;States constituted by the situation with respect to Hong Kong.</p>



<p>The situation with respect to Hong Kong, including recent actions taken by the People&#8217;s Republic of China to fundamentally undermine Hong Kong&#8217;s autonomy, continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.&nbsp; For this reason, the national emergency declared on July 14, 2020, must continue in effect beyond July 14, 2022.&nbsp; Therefore, in accordance with section&nbsp;202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13936 with respect to the situation in Hong Kong.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">South Lawn</p>



<p>11:17 A.M. EDT</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Good morning, everyone.&nbsp; Doc, thank you.&nbsp; Your heroism in treating the wounded children in Uvalde, many of whom you’ve known their whole lives &#8212; their whole lives &#8212; and treated them with normal child problems as a pediatrician, it’s something we’ll never forget.</p>



<p>And, Garnell, it’s good to see you again.&nbsp; I know how tough it is.&nbsp; A lot of people in here have been victims of gun violence &#8212; lost sons, daughters, husbands, wives.&nbsp; They understand your pain.&nbsp; And every time you stand up to talk about it, even for a good cause, it brings it all back like it happened yesterday.&nbsp; But thank you for the courage to do it.</p>



<p>Jill and I will never forget the time we spent with you and your families.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I want to thank &#8212; thank the Vice President Harris and the Second Gentleman; and members of the Cabinet, eight of whom are here today; as well as mayors and elected officials from across the country.</p>



<p>I want to particularly thank the Governor of Illinois and the Mayor of Highland Park for being here.&nbsp; We’ve had &#8212; (applause) &#8212; no, I mean it sincerely.&nbsp; We had a number of conversations immediately after the attack in Highland Park.&nbsp; And I’ve been impressed with the way they’ve handled things.&nbsp; It’s been extraordinary.&nbsp; And as the three of us have discussed, we have more to do.</p>



<p>I also want to thank the bipartisan group of senators who worked so hard to get this done, especially Senators Murphy &#8212; (applause); Sinema &#8212; (applause); Cornyn and Tillis.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; I hope it doesn’t get you in trouble mentioning your name.&nbsp; Thank you for the courage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As well as all of the members of Congress who have worked on these issues for a long time, 80 of whom are with us today.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I’m sorry Senators Schumer and Blumenthal can’t be here today, but they’re working from home, overcoming mild cases of COVID.</p>



<p>I know how hard it is to get things done because I know how hard it was to write the first gun legislation &#8212; at least the first from my career &#8212; that was passed nearly 30 years ago.&nbsp; That’s how long ago it was.</p>



<p>And as I look out in this crowd, I see so many advocates and families, many of whom have become friends, whose lives have been shattered by gun violence and who have made it their purpose to save other lives.</p>



<p>I’ve spent so much time with so many of you over the years that we’ve actually become personal friends.&nbsp; And I can’t thank you enough for your willingness to continue to fight for other families.</p>



<p>Nothing can bring back your loved ones, but you did it to make sure that other families don’t have to experience the same loss and pain that you’ve experienced.</p>



<p>And you have felt and you feel the price of inaction, that this has taken too long, with too much of a trail of bloodshed and carnage.&nbsp; And I know public policy can seem remote, technical, and distant from our everyday lives.&nbsp; But because of your work, your advocacy, your courage, lives will be saved today and tomorrow because of this.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>What we are doing here today is real, it’s vivid, it’s relevant.&nbsp; The action we take today is a step designed to make our nation the kind of nation we should be.&nbsp; It&#8217;s about the most fundamental of things &#8212; the lives of our children, of our loved ones.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We face, literally, a moral choice in this country &#8212; a moral choice with profound, real-world implications.</p>



<p>Will we take wise steps to fulfill the responsibility to protect the innocent and while keeping faith with constitutional rights?</p>



<p>Will we match thoughts and prayers with action?&nbsp;</p>



<p>I say yes.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; And that’s what we’re doing here today.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>Today is many things.  It’s proof that despite the naysayers, we can make meaningful progress on dealing with gun violence.</p>



<p>AUDIENCE MEMBER:&nbsp; We have to do more than that!</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Because make no mistake &#8212; sit down.&nbsp; You’ll hear what I have to say if you think &#8212;</p>



<p>AUDIENCE MEMBER:&nbsp; We have to do more than that!&nbsp;</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; You &#8212;</p>



<p>AUDIENCE MEMBER:&nbsp; We have to open an office in the White House.&nbsp; (Inaudible.)&nbsp; I’ve been trying to tell you this for years.&nbsp; (Inaudible.)</p>



<p>AUDIENCE MEMBER:&nbsp; President Biden!&nbsp; Yeah!&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; We have one.&nbsp; Let me finish my comments.</p>



<p>AUDIENCE MEMBER:&nbsp; (Inaudible.)</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Let him talk.&nbsp; Let him talk.&nbsp; No one &#8212; okay?</p>



<p>Because make no mistake about it: This legislation is real progress, but more has to be done.&nbsp; The provision of this new legislation is going to save lives.&nbsp; And it’s proof that in today’s politics we can come together on a bipartisan basi- &#8212; basis to get important things done, even on an issue as tough as guns.</p>



<p>And one more thing: It’s a call to action to all of us to do more &#8212; (applause) &#8212; to take away from the legislation, it is not &#8212; that’s not what we can do.&nbsp; It’s to take the &#8212; the take-away from this is that now &#8212; now we’re opening to get much more done.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Senator Murphy has said: When you look at the biggest social issues America has faced throughout our history, quote, “Success begets success.”&nbsp; And that’s when you, quote, “finally move that mountain.”&nbsp; You can &#8212; you can ignite a movement when you do that for more progress to follow.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have finally moved that mountain &#8212; a mountain of opposition, obstruction, and indifference that has stood in the way and stopped every effort at gun safety for 30 years in this nation.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>And now is the time to galvanize this movement, because that’s our duty to the people of this nation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s what we owe those families in Buffalo, where a grocery store became a killing field.</p>



<p>It’s what we owe those families in Uvalde, where an elementary school became a killing field.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s what we owe those families in Highland Park, where, on July 4th, a parade became a killing field.</p>



<p>And that’s what we owe all those families represented here today and all over this country the past many years, across our schools, places of worship, workplaces, stores, music festivals, nightclubs, and so many other everyday places that have turned into killing fields.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And that&#8217;s what we owe the families all across this nation where, every day, tragic killings that don&#8217;t make the headlines are more than passing mention &#8212; a little more than passing mention in the local news.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Neighborhoods and streets have been turned into killing fields as well.</p>



<p>Today&#8217;s legislation is an important start.&nbsp; And here are the key things that it does: It provides $750 million in crisis intervention and red-flag laws so the parent, a teacher, a counselor can flag for the court that a child, a student, a patient is exhibiting violent tendencies, threatening classmates, or experiencing suicidal thoughts that makes them a danger to themselves and to others.</p>



<p>Fort Hood, Texas, 2009: 13 dead, 30 more injured.</p>



<p>Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, 1918 [2018]: 17 dead, 17 injured.</p>



<p>In both places, countless others suffering with invisible wounds.</p>



<p>In both places, red-flag laws could have stopped both those shooters.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>You know, this new law requiring &#8212; requires young people under 21 to [under]go enhanced background checks before purchasing a gun.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How many more mass shootings do we have to see where a shooter is 17, 18 years old and able to get his hands on a weapon and go on a killing spree?</p>



<p>You know, it closes the so-called “boyfriend loophole.”&nbsp; If you’re convicted of assault against your girlfriend or boy- &#8212; you can’t buy a gun.&nbsp; You can&#8217;t do it.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>According to a recent study, in over 50 percent of mass shootings, the shooter shot a family member or a partner.</p>



<p>So if we keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers, we can save the lives of their partners, and we can also stop more mass shootings.</p>



<p>One, this law includes the first-ever federal law that makes gun trafficking and straw purchases explicit federal crimes.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>It clarifies who needs to register as a federally licensed gun dealer and run background checks before selling a single weapon.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>It invests in anti-violence programs that work directly</p>



<p>with the communities most at risk for gun crimes.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>And this law also provides funding vital for funding to address the youth mental health crisis in this country &#8212; (applause) &#8212; including the trauma experienced by the survivors of gun violence.</p>



<p>It will not save every life from the epidemic of gun violence, but if this law had been in place years ago, even this last year, lives would have been saved.</p>



<p>It matters.&nbsp; It matters.&nbsp; But it’s not enough, and we all know that.</p>



<p>In preparation for today’s signing, I asked to send me their story &#8212; people to send me their stories about their experience with gun violence.&nbsp; I received over 2,500 responses in 24 hours.&nbsp; I didn’t get to read them all, but I read some.</p>



<p>A 17-year-old wrote me saying, quote, “A school shooting sophomore year shattered every sense of normalcy I&#8217;ve ever felt.&nbsp; Almost three years later, I still have nightmares.”</p>



<p>A 24-year-old wrote about growing up in what was a, quote, “seemingly endless era of gun violence.”</p>



<p>A 40-year-old wrote me about two friends shot and killed by abusive partners and former partners.</p>



<p>Someone else wrote me about a 6-year-old child who was sitting near his father’s coffin, was asking, quote, “Why is Daddy in that scary box? &nbsp;Wake up, Daddy.&nbsp; Wake up Daddy.”&nbsp; His father had been gunned down.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I read these stories and so many others.&nbsp; So many others.&nbsp; And, you know, I see the statistics.&nbsp; Over 40,000 people died from gunshot wounds last year in the United States, 25,000 by suicide.</p>



<p>I think: Can this really be the United States of America?&nbsp; Why has it come to this?&nbsp; We all know a lot of the reasons: gun lobby, gun manufacturers, special interest money, the rise of hyper-partisan tribal politics in the country where we don’t debate the issues on the merits and we just rather turn on each other from our corners and attack the other side.</p>



<p>Regardless, we’re living in a country awash in weapons of war &#8212; weapons that weren’t designed to hunt are not being used &#8212; the weapons designed that they&#8217;re purchasing are designed as weapons of war to take out an enemy.</p>



<p>What is the rationale for these weapons outside war zones?&nbsp; Some people claim it’s for sport or to hunt.&nbsp; But let’s look at the facts: The most common rounds fired from an AR-15 move almost twice as fast as that from a handgun.&nbsp; Coupled with smaller, lighter bullets, these weapons maximize the damage done coupled with those bullets, and human flesh and bone is just torn apart.</p>



<p>And as difficult as it is to say, that’s why so many people and some in this audience &#8212; and I apologize for having to say it &#8212; need to provide DNA samples to identify the remains of their children.&nbsp; Think of that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s why trauma surgeons who train for years for these moments know it’s unlikely that someone shot with a high-powered assault weapon will make it long enough for the ambulance to get them to the hospital.</p>



<p>It’s why these scenes of destruction are resembling nothing like a weekend hunting trip for deer or elk.</p>



<p>And yet, we continue to let these weapons be sold to people with no training or expertise.</p>



<p>Case in point: America has the finest fighting force in the world.&nbsp; We provide our service members with the most lethal weapons on Earth to protect America.</p>



<p>We also require them to receive significant training before they’re allowed to use these weapons.</p>



<p>We require extensive background checks on them and mental health assessments on them.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>We require that they learn how to lock up and store these weapons responsibly.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>We require our military to do all that.&nbsp; These are commonsense requirements.&nbsp; But we don’t require the same commonsense measures for a stranger walking into a gun store to purchase an AR-15 or some weapon like that.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It makes no sense.&nbsp; Assault weapons need to be banned.&nbsp; They were banned.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; I led the fight in 1994.&nbsp; And then, under pressure from the NRA and the gun manufacturers and others, that ban was lifted in 2004.</p>



<p>In that 10 years it was law, mass shootings went down.&nbsp; When the law expired in 2004 and those weapons were allowed to be sold again, mass shootings tripled.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They’re the facts.&nbsp; I’m determined to ban these weapons again and high-capacity magazines &#8212; (applause) &#8212; that hold 30 rounds and that let mass shooters fire hundreds of bullets in a matter of minutes.&nbsp; I’m not going to stop until we do it.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here’s another thing we should do: We should have safe storage laws, requiring personal liability for not locking up your gun.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>The shooter in Sandy Hook came from a home full of guns and assault weapons that were too easy to access &#8212; weapons he used to kill his mother and then murder 26 people, including 20 innocent first graders.</p>



<p>If you own a weapon, you have a responsibility to secure it and keep it under lock and key.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>Responsible gun owners agree: No one else should have access to it, so lock it up, have trigger locks.&nbsp; And if you don’t and something bad happens, you should be held responsible.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>I have four shotguns; two are mine and two are my deceased son’s.&nbsp; They’re locked up, lock and key.&nbsp; Every responsible gun owner that I know does that.</p>



<p>We should expand background checks to better keep guns out of the hands of felons, fugitives, and those under domestic violence restraining orders.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Expanded background checks are something that the vast majority of Americans, including the majority of gun owners, agree on.</p>



<p>My fellow Americans, none of what I’m talking about infringes on anyone’s Second Amendment rights.</p>



<p>I’ve said it many times: I support the Second Amendment.</p>



<p>But when guns are the number one killer of children in the United States of America &#8212; let me say that again &#8212; guns are the number one killer of children in the United States.&nbsp; More than car accidents.&nbsp; More than cancer. <a>&nbsp;And over the last two decades</a>, more <s>high-school</s> [school-age] children have died from gun shots than on-duty police officers and active-duty military combined.&nbsp; Think of that.&nbsp; Then we can’t just stand by.&nbsp; We can’t let it happen any longer.</p>



<p>With rights come responsibilities.</p>



<p>Yes, there’s a right to bear arms, but we also have the right to live freely &#8212; (applause) &#8212; without fear for our lives in a grocery store, in a classroom, on a playground, at a house of worship, in a store, at a workplace, a nightclub, a festival, in our neighborhoods and our streets.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>The right to bear arms is not an absolute right that dominates all others.</p>



<p>The perennial price for living in a community with others is being neighbors, of being fellow citizens, is that we obey the laws and customs that ensure what that Fra- &#8212; what the Framers called “domestic tranquility.”</p>



<p>That’s what civilization is.&nbsp; That’s what we have been at our best.&nbsp; That’s what America must always be: a place where we preserve the rights but fulfill our responsibilities.</p>



<p>I know this: There can be no greater responsibility than to do all we can to ensure the safety of our families, our children, and our fellow Americans.</p>



<p>When I spoke to the nation after Uvalde, I shared how a grandmother who had lost her granddaughter gave me and Jill a handwritten letter.&nbsp; We spent four hours, almost five hours with her.</p>



<p>And I read it.&nbsp; It reads, quote, “Erase the invisible line that is dividing our nation to come up with a solution and fix what is broken and to make the changes that are necessary to prevent this from happening again.”&nbsp; End of quote.</p>



<p>That’s why we’re here.&nbsp; That’s why we’re here.</p>



<p>Today, I want to thank those in Congress, both Democrat and Republicans, who erased that invisible line dividing our nation and moved us forward on gun safety.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It’s an important step.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; And now we must look forward.&nbsp; We have so much more work to do.</p>



<p>And I might add, there is $75 million in there for mental health reasons &#8212; a whole range of other things I’m not going to take time to go into today, but it’s important.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>May God bless all of us with the strength to finish the work left undone and &#8212; on behalf of the lives we’ve lost and the lives we can save.&nbsp;</p>



<p>May God bless you all.&nbsp; And may God protect our troops.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>

					<description><![CDATA[To the Senate of the United States: I transmit herewith, for the advice and consent of the Senate to its ratification, the Protocols to the North Atlantic Treaty of 1949 on the Accession of the Republic of Finland and the Kingdom of Sweden (the &#8220;Protocols&#8221;).&#160; The Protocols were signed in Brussels on July 5, 2022,&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>To the Senate of the United States:</p>



<p>I transmit herewith, for the advice and consent of the Senate to its ratification, the Protocols to the North Atlantic Treaty of 1949 on the Accession of the Republic of Finland and the Kingdom of Sweden (the &#8220;Protocols&#8221;).&nbsp; The Protocols were signed in Brussels on July 5, 2022, on behalf of the United States and the other Parties to the North Atlantic Treaty.&nbsp; Also transmitted for the information of the Senate is an overview of the Protocols by the Department of State.&nbsp; Full ratification of the Protocols will allow Finland and Sweden to become Parties to the North Atlantic Treaty and members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).</p>



<p>Article 10 of the North Atlantic Treaty, which outlines NATO&#8217;s Open Door policy, is part of the doctrinal foundation of the Alliance.&nbsp; It states that Allies may, by unanimous consent, invite any other European State in a position to further the principles of the Treaty and to contribute to the security of the North Atlantic area to accede.&nbsp; As further explained in the&nbsp;reports on the accession of Finland and Sweden to NATO, transmitted to the Congress on May&nbsp;19 and July 1, 2022, in light of section 3(2)(E) of the Resolution of Advice and Consent to Ratification of the Protocols to the North Atlantic Treaty of 1949 on the Accession of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic of April 30, 1998, Finland and Sweden more than meet these qualifications.&nbsp; They will be net contributors to the Alliance, in both capabilities and resources, and they share critically important values with the United States.&nbsp; Finland&#8217;s and Sweden&#8217;s accession will help further United States priorities within&nbsp;NATO.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I ask the Senate to continue working with my Administration in advancing a strong and free Europe by providing its prompt advice and consent to ratification of the Protocols.&nbsp; We are encouraging all Allies to act expeditiously in their own ratification processes as well, given current global considerations. &nbsp;My Administration stands ready to brief and assist you in your deliberations.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-right">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>Today, the Biden Administration made public the first <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/webbfirstimages">full-color image</a> from the Webb Space Telescope, which captured the highest-resolution images of the infrared universe in history. The Webb Space Telescope launched from French Guiana in December 2021 and is now orbiting the Sun one million miles away from Earth. The image was previewed to President Biden and Vice President Harris during a briefing at the White House by officials from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), where they discussed how these revolutionary images will enable breakthroughs in nearly every branch of astronomy.</p>



<p>During the briefing, President Biden publicly showed the first of the images: “Webb’s First Deep Field,” the “deepest” and sharpest infrared image of the distant universe ever produced. This image is filled with galaxies, some more than 13 billion years old, which means they formed just after the Big Bang. Over the coming days, NASA will publish additional images, which reveal details about the atmosphere of an exoplanet outside our solar system, “stellar nurseries” where stars form, galaxies that interact and trigger star formation and black holes, and a glimpse into how stars die.</p>



<p>The Webb Space Telescope is an international program led by NASA with its partners,&nbsp;ESA (European Space Agency)&nbsp;and the&nbsp;Canadian Space Agency. Its revolutionary technology will study every phase of cosmic history over the past 13.5 billion years — from inside our solar system to the most distant observable galaxies in the early universe. The telescope gives us the capacity to explore a wide range of questions that help us understand the origins of the universe and our place within it. The telescope is one of humanity’s great engineering feats, launching from Earth on a rocket, and then unfolding itself in space. Thousands of engineers and hundreds of scientists worked to make the telescope a reality, along with over 300 universities, organizations, and companies from 29 U.S. states and 14 countries.</p>



<p>President Biden and Vice President Harris, who chairs the National Space Council, were briefed by NASA Administrator Bill Nelson, Deputy Assistant to the President Dr. Alondra Nelson, who leads the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, Head of NASA Science Thomas Zurbuchen, James Webb Space Telescope Program Director Greg Robinson, Operations Project Scientist Jane Rigby, and Space Telescope Science Institute Deputy Director Nancy Levenson.</p>



<p>The images from the Webb Space Telescope illustrate the great leaps in science and technology discovery that can be made with U.S. government leadership, in partnership with other countries. The Biden-Harris Administration has worked to restore scientific integrity to Federal policy-making and to more broadly and equitably engage and serve Americans around science and technology solutions, including addressing great challenges like pandemics, cancer, and the climate crisis, and ensuring America remains the world leader in technologies and industries of the future that will be critical to our economic prosperity and national security.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">San Antonio, TX</p>



<p>Good afternoon, Unidos. It’s incredibly special to be here with you in San Antonio.<br><br>Earlier today, the White House celebrated the signing of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act—the most significant gun safety law in 30 years.<br><br>You know, when Joe and I visited Uvalde, I stood in front of those 21 crosses, and touched the pictures of the bright, beautiful faces that would never again laugh, or open birthday presents, or tell their parents that they loved them. And I knew that a piece of Uvalde would always be a part of me. <br><br>Like all of you, Joe and I think about those families—and all who carry that grief—every day.  <br><br>When we were leaving the school, someone shouted “Do something!” And I’m proud that Joe has. He will continue to do everything he can and to call on Congress to act, including on measures that ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. <br><br>We are committed to building a safer, healthier, more prosperous, and fair America. <br><br>And I know that Unidos is as well—and has been since the very start. <br><br>In fact, I was reminded of the transformational power of this organization when Joe awarded your longtime leader, Raul Yzaguirre, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, our country’s highest civilian honor. <br><br>Raul has dedicated his life to working for so many civil liberties: from fighting poverty to improving education to advancing voting rights. But one of the most powerful things that he did through this organization was to bring the Latino community together. Because he understood that unity is powerful. And he challenges us to be just as brave and bold.<br><br>It’s a reminder that we all need—now more than ever.   <br><br>A little over a month ago, I had the opportunity to give a commencement to Los Angeles City College students. The crowd was a majority Latino, but the students didn’t share one story. <br><br>There were immigrants, and first-generation Americans, and Angelenos whose families have lived on this land since long before it was called the United States. There were engineers and artists, veterans and students who are going on to four-year colleges. <br><br>They didn’t share one path or dream. But as I saw the joy in their faces, I could see that they did have one thing in common: Each of them will bring exceptional gifts and talents to their corner of our country—and will make their community stronger by being a part of it.</p>



<p>Yes, the Latino community is unique. But what I’ve heard from you again and again is that you want what all families want. Good schools. Good jobs. Safe neighborhoods. <br><br>You want justice and equality—the opportunity to build a better life for your families.<br><br>It’s not only what all families want; it’s what all families deserve. But we can’t get those things on our own.<br><br>Raul helped build this organization with the understanding that the diversity of this community—as distinct as the bodegas of the Bronx, as beautiful as the blossoms of Miami, and as unique as the breakfast tacos here in San Antonio—is your strength. <br><br>And yet, it’s when you speak with one voice—unidos—that you find your power.   <br><br>Thanks to the hard work of you and advocates across the country, we have torn down so many of the barriers that kept Latinos out of our seats of power. But your voice hasn’t always been listened to, has it? <br><br>A few years ago, I met with a group of bright, ambitious young Latino leaders. <br><br>And they told me that there were times when they didn’t feel heard. They asked me: How can our leaders work for us if they don’t work with us?<br><br>It’s an idea that’s always been at the heart of Joe’s work. If you want to know what a community needs—ask them. Give them a seat at the table and then listen to what they have to say. <br><br>And he’s done just that. He’s appointed Latinos to the highest offices in his cabinet. He made sure that legislation like the American Rescue Plan focused on equity. His team worked with all of you—Unidos and so many of the affiliates here today—to get Latinos vaccinated, fight hunger, and invest in your small businesses.  <br><br>And let me say how grateful we are to everyone who has been a partner in that work. It’s because you are on the frontlines that our team can meet Latinos and all Americans where they are. <br><br>We’ve made progress together. And I’m so proud of what Joe has done to pass bipartisan legislation, like the infrastructure and gun bills. I’m proud that he recovered all private sector jobs lost during the pandemic, reopened schools, and cut child poverty in half. <br><br>You were right to put your faith in him two years ago. But I also know that we need to do so much more. We will never make the changes we need when so many of our leaders refuse to work together. When politicians block legislation that the majority of Americans want: A ban on guns that only belong on a battle field. The right to make our own decisions about our own bodies. Universal child care, and community college, and ending child poverty. <br><br>Congress is supposed to represent the will of the people. And that’s why we the people need to speak up. All of us—united. <br><br>We need to vote—in races at every single level. And we need to remember that voting is the bare minimum. We have to get involved in the local governments that decide how cities plan their budgets and protect their students. We have to speak up for justice and equity. We have to demand that we the people be heard—to follow the example you have set.  <br><br>For decades, this organization has brought people together. You’ve built coalitions and helped this community raise its voice. You’ve envisioned a better world and done the difficult work to make it real. <br><br>You do your part every day—and Joe and I are committed to doing the same. The road ahead won’t be easy, but we’re with you in this fight—now and always. <br><br>Your longtime leader, Raul, once said: “When things aren’t going your way, you have to have something to sustain you, and having a love for your community is one thing that will sustain you.” <br><br>I see that love here today. A love that gives us the strength to speak up, even when we’re tired. That helps us come together, to cross any divide. That believes in the best of who we are—and knows that justice is within our reach as long as we never give up on each other.<br><br>Your fight is our fight and we will stand with you—in unity, equity, and love. <br><br>Thank you.   <br></p>

<p>11:08 A.M. EDT<br> <br>     THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Good morning. <br> <br>Thank you, Dr. Guerrero, for the introduction and for your courage and your compassion.  You have been such a source of strength to the families of Uvalde, and I know that is not without personal sacrifice.  Thank you for your leadership.  (Applause.)<br> <br>To our President, Joe Biden; members of Congress &#8212; (applause); members of our administration; friends and fellow Americans: Today is indeed an historic day. <br> <br>For 30 years, our nation has failed to pass meaningful gun violence legislation.  Again and again, the American people have called for commonsense action to protect our communities. <br> <br> Last month, their call was finally answered when President Joe Biden signed the bipartisan Safer Communities Act.  (Applause.)<br> <br>Because of our President&#8217;s leadership and because of so many of you, we have passed a law that will make communities around our nation safer.<br> <br>For my whole career, addressing gun violence has been one of my top priorities.  First, as a courtroom prosecutor.  Then as District Attorney of San Francisco, where we created a gun specialist unit to go after violent offenders.  Then, of course, as Attorney General, where our office worked closely with the California Bureau of Firearms to investigate and seize firearms from those who unlawfully possessed them.  As a United States senator, together with my former colleagues in the Senate, we supported various pieces of legislation to address this crisis. <br> <br>So, I knew and I know now, as so many of you do, that we are overdue in getting this work done.  And I know it will save lives. <br> <br>Together, we gather with many of the leaders who made this law a reality.  To the friends and family members of the victims of gun violence: In the face of so much pain, you have shown incredible strength, and it is a profound honor to stand with you today. <br> <br>To the members of Congress who are here with us: In the face of so much pessimism, you passed a bipartisan law.  You worked across the aisle, and the product of that work will make our communities safer.  And that deserves applause.  (Applause.)<br> <br>But as all of us know, gathered here today, we would not be here were it not for the vision, the courage, the unwavering determination of one particular individual: Joe Biden.  (Applause.)<br> <br>Our President, Joe Biden, has fought for decades to end the terror of gun violence.  He has taken on the gun lobby and won.  As a senator, Joe helped pass &#8212; then I would have called him “Joe”; now I call “Mr. President” &#8212; (laughter) &#8212; the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act &#8212; (applause) &#8212; which, as we know, is a background check system that has prevented more than 3 million firearms from falling into dangerous hands.  (Applause.) <br> <br>And he passed a 10-year ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.  (Applause.)<br> <br>As Vice President, Joe Biden led the Obama-Biden administration&#8217;s efforts to reduce gun violence. <br> <br>President Joe Biden knows the tremendous pain of gun violence.  He has seen it up close.  He has held hands with parents who lost children and with children who lost parents. <br> <br>President Biden knows the urgency of this fight, and he will continue to do all in his power to protect the people of our nation. <br> <br>And now, it is my honor to welcome Garnell Whitfield, Jr., who I spent time with and his family mourning the loss of his beloved mother.<br> <br>     Mr. Whitfield.  (Applause.)<br> <br>                               END                 11:13 A.M. EDT</p>
