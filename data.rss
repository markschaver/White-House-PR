<p>2:44 P.M. CDT<br>&nbsp;<br>THE PRESIDENT: &nbsp;Thank you.&nbsp; Thank you, Amy.&nbsp; What Fritz is really saying looking down is, “Joe, hide your Irish Catholic enthusiasm a little bit and be more Norwegian.”&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>A generous introduction.&nbsp; You know, we got a chance to talk with the family a little bit earlier and trying to console them, and I got emotional.&nbsp; But as my Grandfather Finnegan would say, “That&#8217;s the Irish of it.”<br>&nbsp;<br>You know, I served with Fritz a long time.&nbsp; He became a good and close friend.&nbsp; I was a kid when I got elected.&nbsp; I wasn’t even old to be sworn in.&nbsp; I was only 29 years old.&nbsp; And because everything is based on seniority in the Senate, I got to hang out with folks like Fritz and Hubert long before you&#8217;d ordinarily at my age &#8212; because by the time I was there a second term, I was chairman of some major committees.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And so, I&#8217;m going to talk more today about Fritz and what he pretend didn&#8217;t exist but Fritz’s &#8212; Fritz’s sense of empathy.&nbsp; Fritz had a special way about him that I don&#8217;t think he would talk about.&nbsp; I could be wrong, but I never heard him talk about it.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>You know, there was a question that Fritz famously asked staffers who came to work for him.&nbsp; He&#8217;d say, “On the breakfast plate, what’s the difference between the eggs and the bacon?”&nbsp; Senator Smith and Klobuchar know the answer.&nbsp; (Laughter.)<br>&nbsp;<br>By supplying the eggs, the chicken made a contribution.&nbsp; The hog was fully committed.&nbsp; (Laughter and applause.)<br>&nbsp;<br>And it always surprised Fritz I knew a little about agriculture.&nbsp; Delaware, my state, has a &#8212; and the Delmarva Peninsula has a $5 billion industry: chickens.&nbsp; A lot of chickens.&nbsp; A hell of a lot more chickens than people.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s the biggest industry.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>But Fritz was always committed not merely to the work of his lifetime, which all of you are familiar with.&nbsp; Most people know, most of all, everybody was blessed to know him in this state.<br>&nbsp;<br>You know, Reverend Hart-Andersen, members of Congress and our military, distinguished guests; most of all, the Mondale family &#8212; Ted and William, and Rebecca and Chan; all the grandchildren &#8212; Louis, Amanda, Berit, Charlotte, Cassandra, Danielle; and all the dear friends of the family that are here as well, because he always talked about you all as family: I&#8217;m &#8212; I&#8217;m moved to be with you here today as an &#8212; honor one of the great giants in American history.&nbsp; And that’s not hyperbole.&nbsp; Fritz was a giant in American political history.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>You know, a great American who &#8212; but he also had a lot of great Americans write about him and write things that related to him without them even knowing it.<br>&nbsp;<br>The great American novelist Edith Wharton wrote, “There are two ways of spreading light: to be a candle or the mirror that reflects it.”&nbsp; Fritz was both the candle and the mirror, in my view &#8212; a candle spreading light and the mirror reflecting it.<br>&nbsp;<br>And today, I speak of a friend of five decades, about that light &#8212; the light of friendship and what it meant to me personally, to my family.<br>&nbsp;<br>Fritz and I first met in one of the darkest moments of my life.&nbsp; I had not intended to run for the United States Senate.&nbsp; I was involved &#8212; my state, it was a great shame, was segregated by law.&nbsp; We have the eighth-largest Black population in America as a percent of population in Delaware.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>I got involved in politics indirectly by getting involved in the Civil Rights Movement as a kid, being the only white employee in east side of Wilmington, an area called “The Bucket,” for years.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And I was asked by a group of senior Democrats would I &#8212; I was a young lawyer when I came back from law school.&nbsp; And we were the only city in America occupied by the National Guard for 10 months, with every corner being occupied by National Guard members with a drawn bayonet because of Dr. King&#8217;s assassination and the riots that took place in my home state.<br>&nbsp;<br>And I had a job with one of the oldest law firms in the state &#8212; a “white shoe,” as they used to call the law firm.&nbsp; And after being home for six months, I couldn&#8217;t do it anymore.&nbsp; And I left and tried to &#8212; sought a job as a public defender to represent the people I used to work with in the &#8212; as a kid in high school and college.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And so, I came to the United States Senate with a passion to do something about civil rights.&nbsp; And when I was elected, I ran initially for the group &#8212; with a group I joined, a group of senior members of the United States of the Delaware Democratic establishment to reform the Democratic Party, because we were more a southern Democratic Party than a northeastern Democratic Party.&nbsp; You used to be able to be joined &#8212; the Southern Governors’ Conference with the Mid-Atlantic Conference.&nbsp; And Democratic governors joined the Southern Governors’ Conference.<br>&nbsp;<br>But I couldn&#8217;t bring myself to be a Republican, even though they were more progressive because of Richard Nixon when I registered.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>But I was asked to head up a committee of younger people to try to get someone to run for the United States Senate against a guy who was a decent guy, actually.&nbsp; A little too conservative, but a decent guy.&nbsp; And one thing led to another, and I ended up being asked to run for the Senate.&nbsp; I had no intention of running for the Senate.<br>&nbsp;<br>But two years earlier, I had been elected to the county council.&nbsp; And Delaware is like a miniature Illinois.&nbsp; One county is 60 percent of the state&#8217;s population.&nbsp; So, the councilperson &#8212; I represented a district seven times as large as a state representative and three times as large as a state senator.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And I ran and won.&nbsp; I ran only to be a good soldier to try to get out Democrats voting.&nbsp; And I wasn&#8217;t supposed to win.&nbsp; The only reason I ran &#8212; I was certain I wasn&#8217;t going to rin [sic] &#8212; win &#8212; because I didn&#8217;t want to be a county councilman.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; I wanted &#8212; I was just setting up a law firm as a young senator &#8212; as a young man, I should say.<br>&nbsp;<br>And so, what happened was I won in a district that was like 55, 56 percent Republican.&nbsp; No Democrat had ever won.&nbsp; Republicans saw something in me I didn&#8217;t see: They saw someone who may want to go on and run for office beyond that, so they reapportioned me from a four-year term to a two-year term (inaudible) 65 percent district.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And I was put in a position of up or out.&nbsp; And a group of senior members &#8212; a former governor, a former United States Senator, a former congressman, and the chief justice of the &#8212; retired chief justice of the Supreme Court, whose family had more senators than any family in American history.&nbsp; And they came to me &#8212; an off-year convention.<br>&nbsp;<br>I&#8217;ll never forget I was &#8212; how classic it was. &nbsp;I was &#8212; there was a break in the convention in Dover, Delaware. &nbsp;I was at a little motel nearby. &nbsp;Had to &#8212; to go back and change with the younger people I was with. &nbsp;And I had my own room. &nbsp;And, you know, the typical kind of &#8212; you drive up to the front door, two headboards nailed on the wall, a desk nailed to the other wall, and an 8 by 10 bathroom.<br>&nbsp;<br>So I was in, shaving.&nbsp; I had my towel around.&nbsp; Man, I just got a shower and shaving, and I &#8212; there&#8217;s banging at the door. And I thought it was one of those &#8212; a guy named Bob Cunningham was with me.&nbsp; I said, “All right, all right, all right.”&nbsp; I went to the door and opened the door.&nbsp; There was a former two-term governor named Elbert –- Elbert Carvel, a former congressman named Harrison, and the state chairman, and a former chief justice.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And I&#8217;m standing in a towel, shaving, and my &#8212; (laughter) &#8212; and the rest of me stark naked.&nbsp; And I said &#8212; they said, “We want to talk to you, Joe.”&nbsp; So I said, “Well, come in, gentlemen.”&nbsp; I ran into the bathroom, take off the shaving cream, hoping I can find something to put on.&nbsp; I had nothing to put on.&nbsp; (Laughter.)<br>&nbsp;<br>So I came back out and I leaned against that desk and with a towel around me.&nbsp; I said, “Yes, gentlemen?”&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; And they said, “Joe, we just had dinner.&nbsp; We think you should run for the Senate.”&nbsp; And I said, “But…”&nbsp; And the chief justice &#8212; former Chief Justice (inaudible) said that.&nbsp; I said, “Sir.”&nbsp; I said, “I&#8217;m &#8212; I&#8217;m not old enough.”&nbsp; He said, “Joe, you obviously didn&#8217;t do very well on constitutional law.”&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; I&#8217;m thinking, “Holy God, what did I do now?”&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; And he said, “You only have to be 30 to be sworn in.&nbsp; They can elect you whenever you want.&nbsp; You’ll be 30 seventeen days later.<br>&nbsp;<br>Well, I ran, and, to the shock and surprise of everybody, I won by a staggering 3,100 votes.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>But here&#8217;s the point: I showed up on December 18th to hire staff.&nbsp; I hadn&#8217;t been sworn in yet.&nbsp; And what happened was that I had gotten a phone call that day from my fire department in Delaware.&nbsp; And they put a poor young woman on the phone who said, “You got to come home.&nbsp; There&#8217;s been an accident.”&nbsp; And she went on to tell me &#8212; the poor kid had to tell me there was an accident.&nbsp; I asked, “What happened?”&nbsp; She said, “Your wife and daughter are dead, and your two boys may not make it.”&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And, you know, the last thing I wanted to do was go to the United States Senate after that.&nbsp; We had elected a governor &#8212; a Democrat.&nbsp; He could appoint a Democrat.&nbsp; And I had my brother talking to him about who we&#8217;d appoint.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>But there was Fritz and Joan.&nbsp; They embraced me, cont- &#8212; contacted me.&nbsp; And it’s not just being nice, but bringing me in.&nbsp; They came to the hospital to see my boys.&nbsp; They helped me find my purpose in a sea of darkness and pain.<br>&nbsp;<br>And along &#8212; I was with Fritz, along with Mike Mansfield and Teddy Kennedy and a few others who all came to see me and said, “Just come six months.&nbsp; You can go home after that.&nbsp; We need you.”&nbsp; We had 58 Democrats; they didn’t need me for a damn thing.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; No, I&#8217;m serious.&nbsp; But I was so &#8212; such a rookie I thought, “Maybe they need me to organize.”&nbsp; (Laughter.)<br>&nbsp;<br>And they said, “Then you can leave.”&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And I used to show up every Tuesday at three o&#8217;clock in the Senate chamber to get an assignment from Senator Mansfield.&nbsp; Many times, Fritz would walk me over.&nbsp; And I thought all freshmen got assignments.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t know that nobody gets an assignment in the Senate.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; It wasn’t until about five months or three months in that I realized that was the case.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>But they kept me engaged.&nbsp; They helped me get up when it was easy to give up.<br>&nbsp;<br>My life changed again five years later.&nbsp; No man deserves one great love in his life, let alone two, but I met and married Jill Biden.&nbsp; I had to ask her five times.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; True.&nbsp; But being a spouse of a Senator who was relatively well known, because of the celebrity of how I got there and the accident, and inheriting two beautiful young boys wasn&#8217;t easy.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Once again, Fritz and Joan were there &#8212; were there spreading the light.&nbsp; Joan was one of the first people to reach out to Jill, and it meant the world to us.&nbsp; It meant the world.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>You just heard from my friend, Jon Meacham, Fritz was a master legislator who shone a light on those who needed it most.&nbsp; The desire to lift up others stemmed from his youth, from his service as a corporal in the U.S. Army, and those early days organizing for Hubert Humphrey in parts of Minnesota that Democrats didn’t win.<br>&nbsp;<br>Fritz learned early the power of bringing people together.&nbsp; And I know that Fritz &#8212; for Fritz, no moment was brighter than when he joined forces &#8212; because I was with him; I was just a bit player &#8212; with an African American senator from &#8212; Massachusetts Senator Edward Brooke and they passed the Fair Housing Act.<br>&nbsp;<br>I was on the same side &#8212; the same side of the chamber in the back where Fritz was.&nbsp; I remember the look on his face &#8212; literally remember the look on his face.&nbsp; Opened up neighborhoods diminished by segregation for so long.&nbsp; When the act passed, Fritz spoke on the Senate floor.&nbsp; And he said that, quote, “The words ‘justice’ and ‘fairness’ will mean more to millions of our fellow Americans than they do &#8212; will never &#8212; meant more to our fellow Americans than they do today.”<br>&nbsp;<br>That was Fritz spreading light, the light of our country, to families who had never truly known its warmth.<br>&nbsp;<br>At every stage of our lives, at every inflection point, Fritz and Joan &#8212; I apologize, as we say in the Senate, for the, you know, point of personal privilege here &#8212; but they were there for Jill and me and my family &#8212; not on a political level, but on a personal level.&nbsp; It was true that my &#8212; first days in the Senate when I needed help very badly, and it was true in my last days in the Senate as well.<br>&nbsp;<br>In 2008 &#8212; and Fritz and I had become close friends, and I sought his counsel many times &#8212; I was asked to join the ticket with Barack Obama.<br>&nbsp;<br>I was, as I usually was, on Amtrak going home.&nbsp; I commuted every day.&nbsp; They later told me over 1,200,000 miles on Amtrak.&nbsp; They should name a station or something after me.&nbsp; (Laughter.)<br>&nbsp;<br>But all kidding aside, he called me after it was clear he was the de facto nominee.&nbsp; And he said he&#8217;d liked me to join him on the ticket, at least consider it; could he do a background check on me.&nbsp; You know, we have to do that background check.&nbsp; And I said, “No thanks, Barack.”&nbsp; I thought he was just dragging that bloody (inaudible) through the Senate like president &#8212; presidential nominees do to get everybody excited and involved.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And Barack told me, “No, no, no, there&#8217;s only one other person I&#8217;m considering.”&nbsp; I said, “Barack, I don&#8217;t want to be Vice President.”&nbsp; He said, “Why?”&nbsp; I said, “Because you’re basically just standby equipment.”&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; I said, “What I want to do &#8212; I&#8217;m &#8212; I&#8217;m…”&nbsp; And by that time, I had chaired two major committees.&nbsp; I was fairly influential in the Senate.&nbsp; I said, “I can help you a lot more as a senator.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll do everything I can.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll campaign throughout the country for you.”&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Barack to- &#8212; asked me &#8212; he said, “Look, would you go home and talk it over with your family?&nbsp; Just talk it over.”&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So I did.&nbsp; I called Jill from the train on my cell phone. And when I got home &#8212; I was about halfway home when I had gotten the call.&nbsp; And when I got home, I went in.&nbsp; And the first person I called was Fritz before the family gathered in the back porch.&nbsp; And I asked &#8212; I said, “Fritz, what should I do?”&nbsp; And he went into great detail.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; I&#8217;m serious.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, he sent me a long memorandum he prepared for President Carter when they were deciding how the relationship would work.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>He told me, in essence, that the vice presidency holds no inherent power.&nbsp; None.&nbsp; Zero.&nbsp; The Vice President is merely &#8212; and it’s true &#8212; a reflection of your relationship with the President of the United States.<br>&nbsp;<br>About seven years ago, I joined Fritz at a forum in his honor at George Washington University.&nbsp; Fritz recounted that his greatest strength wasn&#8217;t his expertise in a particular policy area; it was the genuine personal relationship he built with President Jimmy Carter &#8212; a relationship built on real affection and trust.<br>&nbsp;<br>They sat down for lunch together every week.&nbsp; Fritz said, “Make sure you get a commitment from Barack: Once a week, you have lunch to discuss whatever is on either of your minds.”&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>He was the first Vice President to have an office in the West Wing, just a few steps away from the Oval Office.&nbsp; That never happened before.&nbsp; They were over in the Executive Office Building across the street.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>That was the true strength of the vice presidency he said, a strength that Barack and I replicated in our time in office and what I&#8217;m &#8212; Kamala and I are doing today.&nbsp; And she sends her regards to the whole family.&nbsp; She called me before I got in the plane. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>It was Fritz who lit the way.&nbsp; His core &#8212; at his core, Fritz embraced everybody with a belief that everyone is entitled to be treated with dignity &#8212; everybody.&nbsp; Dignity.&nbsp; Not just the right to vote, dignity.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>He was loved by the American people because he reflected the goodness of the American people, especially the people of Minnesota.<br>&nbsp;<br>You know, every senator wears on his or her sleeve the state they serve.&nbsp; But the love Fritz had for the people of Minnesota ran deeper than that.&nbsp; He loved you all, and you loved him back &#8212; it was obvious &#8212; because Fritz reflected the very best qualities of this state: the warmth and optimism that you reflect.<br>&nbsp;<br>At every turn, Fritz reflected the light of this nation, who we are and what we can be.&nbsp; He called me when I had said in the inauguration that we&#8217;re the most unique nation in all of history.&nbsp; We&#8217;re the only nation founded on an idea.&nbsp; Every other nation in the world is based on geography, ethnicity, religion, race.&nbsp; We’re founded on an idea.&nbsp; “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men and women are created equal, endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, including the right to life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness.”&nbsp; And it goes on.<br>&nbsp;<br>Fritz believed that in his gut.&nbsp; I watched him every day for over 35 years in the Senate and when he was Vice President.&nbsp; He united people, sharing the same light, the same hopes.&nbsp; Even when we disagree, he thought that was important.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>I&#8217;ll never forget, on a personal level, what it meant to have a friend like Fritz.&nbsp; Less than four years after losing Eleanor to brain cancer and just a year after losing Joan, Fritz was there to help me again when Jill and I lost our son Beau to brain cancer after a year in Iraq.<br>&nbsp;<br>I&#8217;ll never forget how Fritz reflected so much love and light into our family &#8212; again, at our darkest moments &#8212; nor will I forget coming here to Minneapolis eight years ago to say goodbye to Joan.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Most of you remember that Fritz went to the Mayo Clinic for quadruple bypass the very next day.&nbsp; He had delayed the surgery so he could be with all of us to reflect her light.&nbsp; And he put off treating his own heart because, as all you know, his heart belonged to Joan.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>As I&#8217;ve said many times &#8212; I say to the family, seeing your mom and dad together reminded me of that great line from Christopher Marlowe’s poem: “Come live with me and be my love, and we shall all the pleasures prove.”<br>&nbsp;<br>You can tell when a couple has been together a long time.&nbsp; So looks at each other with love &#8212; deep love.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>It’s been said that memory is the power to gather roses in winter.&nbsp; Well, Ted and William, your dad blessed you with an endless garden of those memories and, most of all, the memory of two extraordinary loves: a love of more than 58 years he spent together with your mom, and a love of 51 years with your sister, Eleanor.<br>&nbsp;<br>In his farewell letter, Fritz wrote that he was eager to rejoin Joan and Eleanor, two unbreakable loves.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>You know, Jill Biden wanted to do a garden at the Vice President&#8217;s Residence &#8212; a picture of which shows on the screen outside here that I&#8217;m standing in front of the Residence &#8212; so that every family that ever had lived there, there was a garden with stones and engraving on each of the stones with the name of the &#8212; the couple and the children.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>When I called Fritz to tell him about it, he came over to the house.&nbsp; And it was a summer day.&nbsp; And he wanted &#8212; he said, “Can we go in the house?”&nbsp; I said, “Of course.”&nbsp; He wanted to walk up to the third floor.&nbsp; He walked up to the third floor and then, to the end, there are bedrooms in the third floor.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And he stopped in front of a door and opened it and just stared.&nbsp; And I knew he was thinking something deep, and I went down the hallway.&nbsp; And a few minutes &#8212; a few minutes went by and he came down.&nbsp; And he said, “That was Eleanor’s room.&nbsp; I so miss her.”&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Well, they&#8217;re all together now, for all time.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, “An institution is the lengthened shadow of one man.”<br>&nbsp;<br>There is no doubt that the institution of the Senate and the institution &#8212; the institution of the Vice President reflect the profound legacy of Fritz Mondale.<br>&nbsp;<br>But it’s not a lengthened shadow we see in those places; it’s his light.&nbsp; And it’s up to each of us now to reflect that light that Fritz was all about, to reflect Fritz’s goodness and grace, the way he made people feel no matter who you were.<br>&nbsp;<br>Just imagine what our nation could achieve if we followed Fritz’s example of honor, decency, integrity, literally just the service to the common good.&nbsp; There would be nothing &#8212; nothing, nothing, nothing beyond our reach.<br>&nbsp;<br>I hope we all can be Fritz’s mirror, continue to spread his light.&nbsp; Because you know he was one of the finest men you’ve ever known, one of the most decent people I ever dealt with, and one of the toughest, smartest men I&#8217;ve ever worked with.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>You were lucky to have had him.&nbsp; (Inaudible) look at things, he was lucky to have had you.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>God bless you, my dear friend.&nbsp; Among the greatest of all Americans.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The highest compliment, my Grandfather Finnegan used to say, you can give a man or a woman &#8212; he was &#8212; the Irish of it is to say, “He&#8217;s a good man.”&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Fritz Mondale was a good man.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>3:12 P.M. CDT</p>

<p>As Muslims in the United States and around the world conclude the month of Ramadan and celebrate Eid al-Fitr, Jill and I extend our warmest wishes to all who are celebrating this joyous occasion.<br><br>Eid marks the completion of a holy month dedicated to devotion and reflection, when families and communities come together to celebrate their blessings. And Eid is also an occasion for Muslims to remember all those who are struggling or impacted by poverty, hunger, conflict, and disease, and to recommit to building a better future for all.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br>This year, as we mark Eid al-Fitr, we hold in our hearts the millions of displaced persons and refugees around the globe who are spending this sacred holiday separated from their families and unsure of their future, but still hoping for a brighter tomorrow. As a nation we must always keep faith with those seeking a better life, and uphold our commitment to serving as a beacon of hope for oppressed people around the world. And, Muslims across the United States celebrate Eid, let us renew our dedication to our foundational commitment to respecting all faiths and beliefs.<br><br>The Holy Qur’an urges people to stand firmly for justice and reminds us that we were created as nations and tribes so that we may get to know one another. &nbsp;The tradition of religious freedom for all strengthens our country, and we will continue to work with Americans of all beliefs and backgrounds to safeguard and deepen our collective commitment to this fundamental principle. This year, we will resume the tradition of celebrating Eid at the White House, and of honoring the inspiring Muslim Americans who are leading efforts to build greater understanding and unity across our nation.&nbsp;<br><br>To all those celebrating, Jill and I wish you and your loved ones a Happy Eid.&nbsp; May the spirit of community, compassion, and service we have witnessed over the last month continue throughout the year. <em>Eid Mubarak</em>!</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Washington Hilton<br>Washington, D.C.<br>&nbsp;<br>(April 30, 2022)</p>



<p>10:07 P.M. EDT<br> <br>THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.  Thank you, Steve, for that introduction.  And a special thanks to the 42 percent of you who actually applauded.  (Laughter.)<br> <br>I’m really excited to be here tonight with the only group of Americans with a lower approval rating than I have.  (Laughter.)  That’s hard to say after what we just saw.  (Laughter.)<br> <br>This is the first time a President attended this dinner in six years.  (Applause.)  It’s understandable.  We had a horrible plague followed by two years of COVID.  (Laughter and applause.)<br> <br>Just imagine if my predecessor came to this dinner this year.  Now, that would really have been a real coup if that occurred.  (Laughter.)  A little tough, huh?  (Laughter.)<br> <br>But I’m honored to be here at such an event with so much history.<br> <br>As already referenced, the very first President to attend the White House Correspondents’ Dinner was Calvin Coolidge in 1924.  I had just been elected to the United States Senate.  (Laughter.)  And I reme- &#8212; I remember telling him, “Cal, just be yourself.  Get up there and speak from the heart.  You&#8217;re going to be great, kid.  You&#8217;re going to do it well.”  (Laughter.)<br> <br>Of course, Jill is with me tonight.  Jilly, how are you, kid?  (Applause.)  I think &#8212; I think she&#8217;s doing an incredible job as First Lady.  (Applause.)  The First Lady to continue working full-time, and she does as a professor.<br> <br>She doesn’t pay much attention to the polls, though she did say the other day: Instead of introducing myself as Jill Biden’s husband, maybe I should introduce myself as her roommate.  (Laughter.)<br> <br>I&#8217;ve attended this dinner many times, but this is my first time as President.  And the organizers had &#8212; had it hard &#8212; made it pretty hard for me tonight.  Although the good news is, if all goes well, I have a real shot at replacing James Corden.  (Laughter.)<br> <br>It was great having him over at the White House the other day, just as he announced he’s leaving the show.  A great performer is going out on top after eight years in the job.  Sounds just about right to me.  (Laughter and applause.)<br> <br>And it’s tough to follow pros like James and Billy Eichner.   Billy, where are you again?  Do you &#8212; where is he? <br> <br>Well, Billy, you&#8217;re famous for interviewing &#8212; your interviewing skills.  Billy, you should know what you’re doing, pal.  You know it &#8212; you know it well.  And you should &#8212; I think you should host “Meet the Press.”  Maybe they’ll start to watch it again.  (Laughter.) <br> <br>I&#8217;ve never had &#8212; (laughs) &#8212; never had to &#8212; (laughs) &#8212; I&#8217;ve never had to open &#8212; I’ll never be &#8212; I’ll never be invited to “Meet the Press” again.  Anyway.  (Laughter.)<br> <br>I’ve never had to open before Trevor Noah.  Trevor is great.  When I was elected, he did a show and he called me “America’s new dad.”  (Laughter.)  Let me tell you something, pal: I’m flattered anybody would call me a “new” anything.  (Laughter.)  You&#8217;re my guy.<br> <br>And, folks, it’s been a tough few years for the country.  That’s one reason why it’s great to be here again.<br> <br>Everyone at the White House is so excited.  I told my grandkids and Pete Buttigieg they could stay up late and watch this show tonight.  (Laughter and applause.) <br> <br>Tonight &#8212; tonight we come here and answer a very important question on everybody’s mind: Why in the hell are we still doing this?  (Laughter.)<br> <br>I know there are &#8212; I know there are questions about whether we should gather here tonight because of COVID.  Well, we’re here to show the country that we’re getting through this pandemic.  Plus, everyone had to prove they were fully vaccinated and boosted.  (Applause.) <br> <br>So, if you’re at home watching this and you&#8217;re wondering how to do that, just contact your favorite Fox News reporter.  They’re all here, vaccinated and boosted &#8212; all of them.   (Laughter and applause.)<br> <br>And, look, Fox &#8212; Fox News, I’m &#8212; I&#8217;m really sorry your preferred candidate lost the last election.  To make it up to you, I’m happy to give my Chief of Staff to you all so he can tell Sean Hannity what to say every day.  (Laughter.)<br> <br>In fact, Ron Klain is here at the CBS table, which hired Mick Mulvaney.  Mick, on CBS?  I was stunned.  I figured he’d end up on “The Masked Singer” with Rudy.  (Laughter.)<br> <br>Amazing hire, guys.  Really quite amazing. <br> <br>Look, I know this is a tough town.  I came to office with an ambitious agenda, and I expected it to face stiff opposition in the Senate.  I just hoped it would be from Republicans.  (Laughter.)<br> <br>But I’m not worried about the midterms.  I&#8217;m not worried about them.  We may end up with more partisan gridlock, but I’m confident we can work it out during my remaining six years in the presidency.  (Applause.)<br> <br>And, folks, I’m not really here to roast the GOP.  That’s not my style.  Besides, there’s nothing I can say about the GOP that Kevin McCarthy hasn’t already put on tape.  (Laughter.)<br> <br>And, you know, at the same &#8212; at the same time, a lot of people say the Republican Party is too extreme, too divisive, too controlled by one person.  They say, “It’s not your father’s Republican Party.”<br> <br>Ronald Reagan said, “Mr. Gorbachev, tear this wall down.”  Today’s Republicans say, “Tear down Mickey Mouse’s house.”  (Laughter.)   And pretty soon, they’ll be storming Cinderella’s Castle, you can be sure of it.<br> <br>But Republicans seem to support one fella &#8212; some guy named Brandon.  (Laughter.)  He’s having a really good year, and I’m kind of happy for him.  (Laughter and applause.)<br> <br>Let me conclude with a serious word. <br> <br>We live in serious times.  We’re coming through a devastating pandemic, and we have to stay vigilant.  I know Kamala wanted to be here, for example, and thankfully she’s doing well.  You should all know she sends her best.  (Applause.)<br> <br>We’re in a time when what we so long have taken for granted is facing the gravest of threats.  And I&#8217;m being deadly earnest.<br> <br>Oversear [sic] &#8212; overseas, the liberal world order that laid the foundation for global peace, stability, and prosperity since World War Two is genuinely, seriously under assault.<br> <br>And at home, a poison is running through our democracy of all &#8212; all of this taking place with disinformation massively on the rise, where the truth is buried by lies and the lies live on as truth.<br> <br>What’s clear &#8212; and I mean this from the bottom of my heart &#8212; that you, the free press, matter more than you ever did in the last century.  (Applause.)  No, I really mean it. <br> <br>I’ve always believed that good journalism holds up a mirror to ourselves to reflect on the good, the bad, and the true.  Tonight, I want to congratulate the awardees and the scholarship winners who carry on that sacred tradition.<br> <br>We’ve all seen the courage of the Ukrainian people because of the courage of American reporters in this room and your colleagues across the world who are on the ground, taking their lives in their own hands.  (Applause.)<br> <br>And although it’s not in Ukraine, it’s <s>Russia</s> [Syria] &#8212; Mom, I&#8217;d like to meet you and Dad to talk about your son. <br> <br>We just &#8212; we just saw a heartbreaking video: Nine have been killed reporting from Kyiv &#8212; struck by a kamikaze drone strike after a shopping mall attack; shot in the neck while decounci- [sic] &#8212; while &#8212; while documenting Ukrainians fleeing; killed when Russian missiles hit the television tower in a residential neighborhood.  One journalist from Radio Liberty just killed days ago.<br> <br>So many of you telling the stories and taking the photos and recording the videos of what&#8217;s happening there, the unvarnished truth shown &#8212; showing the &#8212; the destruction and the devastation and, yes, the war crimes.<br> <br>Tonight, we also honor the legacy of two historic reporters, and that is Alice Dunnigan and Ethel Payne.  I&#8217;m glad you saw that tonight.  (Applause.)  I didn’t know you were doing that.  These are the first Black women to be White House reporters who shattered convention to cover a segregated nation.<br> <br>We honor journalists killed, missing, imprisoned, detained, and tortured; covering war, exposing corruption, and holding leaders accountable.<br> <br>We honor members of the press, both national and local, covering a once-in-a-century pandemic where we lost a million Americans, a generation reckoning on race, and the existential threat of climate change.<br> <br>The free press is not the enemy of the people &#8212; far from it.  At your best, you’re guardians of the truth.<br> <br>President Kennedy once said, and I quote, “Without debate, without criticism, no administration, no country can succeed,<br>and no republic can survive.”<br> <br>The First Amendment grants a free press extraordinary protection, but with it comes, as many of you know, a very heavy obligation: to seek the truth as best you can &#8212; not to inflame or entertain, but to illuminate and educate.<br> <br>I know it’s tough.  And I&#8217;m not being solicitous.  The industry is changing significantly.<br> <br>There’s incredible pressure on you all to deliver heat instead of shed light, because the technology is changing so much, the system is changing.  But it matters.  No kidding.  It matters.  The truth matters. <br> <br>American democracy is not a reality show.  (Applause.)  It’s not a reality show.  (Applause.)  It’s reality itself.  And the reality is that we are a great country.<br> <br>Our future is bright.  It’s not guaranteed, because democracy is never guaranteed.  It has to be earned.  It has to be defended.  It has to be protected.<br> <br>As you’ve heard me say many times: There&#8217;s not a damn thing this country can&#8217;t do when we stand united and do it together.  And I know we can do anything we want to do that’s right. <br> <br>I’ve been around a long time, as has been pointed out many times tonight.  (Laughter.)  But I give you my word as a Biden: I’ve never been more optimistic about America than I am today.  I really mean it. <br> <br>At times of enormous change, it presents enormous opportunities.  For despite all the crises, all the partisanship, all the shouting and the showmanship,<br>I really know this and you know it too: We are a great nation because we’re basically a good people.<br> <br>And here in America, good journalism, good satire about our leaders, about our society is quintessentially an American thing.  It demonstrates the power of our example.<br> <br>And I, honest to God, believe it reveals our soul &#8212; the soul of our nation.  And that’s what I’d like to toast tonight, if I may.<br> <br>(The President offers a toast.)<br> <br>To the journalists and their families, to the people and their elected representatives, to the United States of America.  (Applause.)<br> <br>And by the way, Madeleine Albright was right: We are the indispensable nation.  (Applause.)<br> <br>Ladies and gentlemen, I&#8217;m going to turn this over to Trevor now, strap myself into my seat.  (Laughter.)<br> <br>And, Trevor, the really good news is: Now you get to roast the President of the United States and, unlike in Moscow, you won’t go to jail.  (Laughter.)<br> <br>The podium is yours.  (Applause.)</p>

<p>President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. spoke today with President Andrés Manuel López Obrador to reaffirm the vision they laid out in the November 2021 North American Leaders’ Summit of a North America that remains the most competitive and dynamic region in the world.</p>



<p>At a time of immense global challenges, from Russia’s further invasion of Ukraine to economic volatility, the Leaders pledged to work together across the breadth and depth of the relationship between our nations.&nbsp; President Biden and President López Obrador discussed how our countries can continue to advance our shared economic, climate, energy, and migration management goals in line with the <a href="https://trade.gov/HLED">High-Level Economic Dialogue</a>, with a special focus on shoring up North American supply chains.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They discussed their visions for the Summit of the Americas and emphasized ongoing cooperation on <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/04/19/fact-sheet-update-on-the-u-s-strategy-for-addressing-the-root-causes-of-migration-in-central-america/">development in Central America</a> and southern Mexico, strengthening North American supply chains, and modernizing our shared border to further strengthen our agricultural and commercial trade.&nbsp; They also recognized the importance of joint efforts underway to fast-track the development and implementation of key infrastructure projects on both sides of the 2,000 mile U.S.-Mexico border.</p>



<p>In view of the unprecedented flows of migrants from throughout the hemisphere to our two countries, the Presidents reiterated the need to build stronger tools for managing regional migration surges.  To that end, they agreed to enhance our collaboration to support just, humane and effective efforts to reduce irregular migration and to advance our shared goal that countries throughout the region improve their ability to manage their borders in furtherance of humanitarian and security objectives.  They discussed the importance of working together with countries throughout the hemisphere to ensure safe and sustainable livelihoods for their respective citizens and migrant populations, to advance our partnership to create jobs in Central America, and support efforts to expand legal pathways for migrants and refugees.</p>



<p>As President Biden and President López Obrador celebrate that December 12, 2022 marks the 200<sup>th</sup> anniversary of official U.S.-Mexico diplomatic relations, they both recognized that our shared history and shared communities create the strong foundation for friendship and cooperation into the future.  They looked forward to meeting again at the June Summit of the Americas.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">State Dining Room</p>



<p>3:34 P.M. EDT</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Well, look, you know, I want to thank you all for being here and for your updates.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When you’re &#8212; these are some of the &#8212; the Recovery Act was about $900 billion and the President used to always &#8212; President Obama used to like to always kid with me when he did the State of the Union message.&nbsp; He’d never tell me what he was going to say because I presided over the &#8212; the joint session as Vice President.&nbsp; And when we &#8212; it was a big gamble to decide we were going to spend $900 billion trying to get the economy back on its feet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And the President said, “And, by the way, we’re going to make sure I’m turning it over to Joe.”&nbsp; And he started calling me “Sheriff Joe.”&nbsp; Well, the first thing I did was go to Earl Devaney and other inspectors general and said, “Look, we’re going to need a lot of work here.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because, look, the one thing I’ve learned &#8212; and you did when you were the mayor &#8212; and &#8212; is that people expect us to do what we say, and they don’t always get what they expect from elected officials.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, for example, when the CARES Act was passed in the last administration, it was &#8212; it was a very meaningful piece of legislation.&nbsp; But the first thing the President did in the time &#8212; I was hollering a lot about it &#8212; was he fired the inspector general.&nbsp; There was one put in who was just fired.&nbsp; No inspector general had independent access.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What the hell happened?&nbsp; They found out an awful lot of people were getting employment checks that didn&#8217;t deserve unemployment checks.&nbsp; They were making money, and an awful lot of people &#8212; and the list went on.&nbsp; There was a lot of fraud.</p>



<p>And so &#8212; and I should acknowledge that &#8212; Earl Devaney.&nbsp; Earl was a stand-up guy.&nbsp; And I would meet with Earl once a week.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t &#8212; I did not tell Earl what to do.&nbsp; But I found out from Earl what was happening, because he had carte blanche to know how every penny was being spent.</p>



<p>And &#8212; and when we came along with the two large pieces of legislation that tried to keep us &#8212; get us through the pandemic as well as bringing the economy back on its feet, it was clear to me that we were going to need the kind of oversight, and that&#8217;s why I called Gene.&nbsp; And I asked Gene to come in and be a coordinator of this.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, you know, the &#8212; an example &#8212; his example &#8212; I think, Earl’s example is a reminder that the end result of independent analysis of whether it was waste and fraud in the effort to distribute that money through the $900 billion in the Recovery Act was independent analysis indicated that there were less than two tenths of 1 percent of waste, fraud, or abuse &#8212; less than two tenths.</p>



<p>It was heralded as one of the most well-run programs in American history, in terms of size, scope, and did it do what it said it was going to do.</p>



<p>And &#8212; unfortunately, I earned the name from the &#8212; from the President when he said from the podium that I’m &#8212; you know, that “Sheriff Joe is going to be in charge.”&nbsp; I never thought of myself as a sheriff.</p>



<p>But it’s not the way to get things done not having really serious oversight.&nbsp; These programs are large.&nbsp; They’re consequential.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, you know, in my administration, the watchdogs are back.&nbsp; You’re looking at them all here.&nbsp; All of you.&nbsp; And I really mean it.&nbsp; Look.</p>



<p>And it&#8217;s not just whether or not there is fraud going on or wasteful spending.&nbsp; I think I told Gene when I asked him to come in &#8212; was that I&#8217;d get phone calls &#8212; I get inspector generals telling me that the way they were going to spend the money that was in the recovery plan was that they were going to build a frisbee park in such and such a place.</p>



<p>And I said, “No, you&#8217;re not.”&nbsp; I’d call &#8212; I’d pick up &#8212; as the Vice President, pick up the phone and call the governor, the mayor, whomever it was.&nbsp; And I’d say, “You’re not going to do that.”&nbsp; And he’d say, “Well, we can.&nbsp; You can’t stop me.&nbsp; Under the law, I’m able to do it.”</p>



<p>And I’d say, “No, you’re right.&nbsp; I can’t.&nbsp; But I’m going to call &#8212; come out to your city and I’m going to call a press conference and say you’re wasting money on a frisbee park.”&nbsp; Well, son a gun, they didn’t build a frisbee park.</p>



<p>No, I’m not joking.&nbsp; I &#8212; I really mean it.</p>



<p>For example, one of the things that’s going to come up, we &#8212; I think this infrastructure &#8212; Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill is extremely consequential because we&#8217;ve been in a situation where we used to have the number-one infrastructure in the world.&nbsp; We now rank 13th in the world or thereabouts.&nbsp; And we can&#8217;t &#8212; we can&#8217;t be the world leader, absent having the best infrastructure in the world.&nbsp; For real.</p>



<p>And so there&#8217;s &#8212; for example, there’s a lot of money for bridges &#8212; and particularly bridges that are in disrepair, that need help.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, if there&#8217;s a bridge that&#8217;s really in trouble and it may collapse like the one in Pittsburgh did &#8212; and we knew that was going to be &#8212; it was in trouble; didn’t expect it to collapse &#8212; you know, and yet the money is being spent on a bridge that is not particularly needed but it works for the Democrat or Republican governor and mayor because it gets them to an area that they want to make sure their constituents are happy with &#8212; that their supporters are, I want to know that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I want to know where the &#8212; where the money is &#8212; technically, it can can be spent, but it may be the lowest priority in terms of safety for the bridges.&nbsp; And it goes across the board in everything we&#8217;re doing here.</p>



<p>And so, you know, the strong oversight is in how we&#8217;re going to deliver for the American people on time and on budget and making sure the investments we get to where they&#8217;re supposed to go.</p>



<p>I’ll give another example.&nbsp; There was a Midwestern state that had serious, serious problems with access off their interstate into the city.&nbsp; And they needed help, and it was clear the ramps had to be rebuilt to get into the city.&nbsp; But this particular governor decided that he was &#8212; his constituency was a rural constituency.&nbsp; He was going to put two lanes in the western part of the state to do it.&nbsp; So, I called and said, “What are you doing that for?&nbsp; You need &#8212; you badly need &#8212; you&#8217;re having accidents on this…”</p>



<p>Well, they &#8212; you know, he technically could do it, but practically it didn&#8217;t make a lot of sense.&nbsp; Now, that&#8217;s not your job as inspector generals, but your job as inspector generals is not only to remove waste and fraud, but &#8212; is the purpose of the law, from your perspective, being followed?&nbsp; Is it being wasted?&nbsp; Is it being wasted &#8212; not just the fraud, but is it a waste?</p>



<p>And, you know, your work is really essential.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s all about building trust from &#8212; in the American people that we&#8217;re going to spend their money well, that we&#8217;re going to do what we say we&#8217;re going to do.</p>



<p>And so, you know, your work is essential.&nbsp; And &#8212; and one of the things that we tried to do in both these pieces of legislation that are very large &#8212; not just to become &#8212; not just the infrastructure bill, but what we&#8217;re spending &#8212; is we tried to make sure that we demonstrate to the American people that we’re spending the money well, that we&#8217;re doing what we said we were going to do.</p>



<p>And that&#8217;s why, if you notice, I tried to make sure that the legislation was written in such a way that it would bypass general assemblies and go straight to where it’s needed.&nbsp; Because the last thing &#8212; I&#8217;ve learned over the years that if you have something &#8212; you have X billion, 100 million dollars going to a state and how its allocated has to be &#8212; gone through the state legislature, well, guess what?&nbsp; Everybody is going to get a piece of it.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not going to go where it&#8217;s most badly needed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, what we do, we&#8217;ve had funding go directly to cities, directly to the county, and directly to &#8212; be able to pass &#8212; and some of it to the state legislature.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, all of this is about the American people being able to look at what we&#8217;re doing and say, “Hm, they did that pretty well, I guess.&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; I get it.&nbsp; They didn’t waste it.”</p>



<p>And so, you know, I &#8212; I think the work you&#8217;re doing is really important.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I want to make it clear to the press that’s here: Nobody in my administration is telling the inspector generals what they have to do.&nbsp; They&#8217;re totally independent.&nbsp; They make a judgment.&nbsp; If they want to investigate something, do it.&nbsp; If we &#8212; period.&nbsp; So, let&#8217;s find out what&#8217;s going wrong and what’s going right and what help you need in order to determine if you&#8217;re not getting the information you need.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so, because I know there’s a &#8212; I’ll conclude by saying there&#8217;s a lack of &#8212; for the last 10 years &#8212; and we got to change it &#8212; a lack of, sort of, faith in government doing exactly what it says it’s going to do.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We&#8217;re going to do what we say we’re going to do, and it’s because of all of you.</p>



<p>And I’m going to turn it back to you, Mitch.&nbsp; And then we’re going to go into &#8212;</p>



<p>MR. LANDRIEU:&nbsp; Yes, sir.</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; &#8212; more detail.&nbsp; I guess.</p>



<p>MR. LANDRIEU:&nbsp; Thank you, Mr. President.&nbsp; Thank you, guys.</p>



<p>(Cross-talk by reporters.)</p>



<p>Q &nbsp;&nbsp; Your reaction to the American killed in Ukraine, sir?</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; It’s very sad.&nbsp; He left a little infant baby behind.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">James S. Brady Press Briefing Room</p>



<p>2:12 P.M. EDT</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Hi, everyone.&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; A couple items for you at the top.&nbsp;</p>



<p>President Biden is committed to doing everything he can to address &#8212; (staffer pulling chair seat down) &#8212; some sticky seats over there &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Sorry.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; &#8212; to address the pain Americans are feeling at the pump as a result of President Putin&#8217;s price hike and his unjustified war’s impact on global fuel supply.</p>



<p>Today, the EPA announced that it is issuing an emergency fuel waiver to allow E15 sales during the summer driving season.&nbsp; This, of course, is a follow-up to what the President announced in Iowa just two weeks ago.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The waiver is a critical step to address the fuel supply crisis.&nbsp; And, again, as I already noted, it&#8217;s a follow-up to the announcement from last week, and it will lay out actions to increase the use of biofuels in order to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels, accelerate the clean energy transition, build real U.S. energy independence, support American agriculture and manufacturing, and save Americans money.</p>



<p>At current prices, E15 can save a family 10 cents per gallon of gas on average.&nbsp; And many stores sell E15 at an even greater discount.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There’s just over 2,000 gas stations, mostly in the Midwest, where, without this action, the E15 tank &#8212; pump would be covered and Americans wouldn&#8217;t be able to access it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So this builds on the additional steps the President has taken, authorizing the release of 1 million barrels per day from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve for the next six months and the largest release in history; working aro- &#8212; and building a coalition around the world to release an additional 60 million barrels.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I also wanted to give you a little bit of a week ahead &#8212; a quick overview for the week ahead.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As you&#8217;re well aware, tomorrow the President and the First Lady will attend the White House Correspondents’ Dinner, where the President will speak.&nbsp; And I will lower expectations and say it&#8217;s not funny at all.&nbsp; Just kidding.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; See?</p>



<p>As you &#8212; the following day, President Biden will travel to Minneapolis, Minnesota, to attend the memorial service of former Vice President Walter Mondale, who was his friend and mentor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On Monday, the President will present the Presidential Rank Awards to 230 winners for 37 federal agencies in a virtual ceremony.&nbsp; Then, he and the First Lady will host a reception to celebrate Eid in the East Room.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On Tuesday, the President will travel to Alabama, as we&#8217;ve already announced, to visit a Lockheed Martin facility which manufactures weapons systems, such as Javelin anti-tank missiles, which we are providing Ukraine to defend against the Russian invasion.&nbsp; He will also discuss while he&#8217;s there his supplemental funding request, which will help Ukraine defend itself over the long term, support democracy in Ukraine, and address humanitarian needs and economic disruptions due to Putin&#8217;s war.</p>



<p>And on Thursday, the President and First Lady will host a Cinco de Mayo reception in the Rose Garden.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I also wanted to note: Gary Rosenberg &#8212; where are you, Gary?&nbsp; Hello, Gary.&nbsp; Gary is retiring.&nbsp; He’s one of the ABC crew members here at the White House.&nbsp; He is retiring today after 43 years.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Great, Gary.&nbsp; So, amazing.&nbsp; Thank you for your service.&nbsp; We&#8217;re not going to make any connection between your timing and the fact that ABC is reportedly taking Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson to the dinner.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Maybe you&#8217;ll have a wild weekend.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Okay, so let&#8217;s get to your questions.&nbsp; I have, hopefully, a lot of follow-ups to a lot of the supplemental questions you all had yesterday, which I&#8217;m sure will come up.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, why don&#8217;t we get to you, Chris.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was going to start with the supplemental, actually.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Okay, great.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, just wanted to look for an update on where things stand with that and also with COVID funding.&nbsp; How have the conversations gone so far?&nbsp; And how are things going with Republicans as well in getting their support for some of these measures?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; Well, as I noted yesterday: After we put out and announced this request, we have been working full steam ahead in engaging and having discussions with appropriate members, committees, staff about the urgency in moving both of these requests forward. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The President, of course, put them forward because &#8212; together.&nbsp; And that is his preference: for them to move together, because they are both essential.&nbsp; There&#8217;s urgency to moving them both forward.</p>



<p>If I may &#8212; and this may come up as well, but can I give you just a bit of a rundown?&nbsp; This is to Alex’s questions yesterday of what has been spent from the 13.5.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let me just see if I can find this here.&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, we noted and we&#8217;ve confirmed for all of you that of the 13.6, we had already spent 3.25 of the security assistance, so $250 million left.&nbsp; That remains the case.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The first supplemental also provided roughly $6 billion in direct security &#8212; in direct econo- &#8212; I mean, that includes &#8212; the $6 billion includes that 3.5, as well as economic assistance &#8212; all of that in there.&nbsp; So, 95 percent of that has been exhausted.&nbsp; And that means that, of course, the $250 million is part of the 5 percent left and also some economic assistance that has not yet been spent from that tranche.</p>



<p>The first supplemental also provided about $4.2 billion for humanitarian assistance, for humanitarian needs globally.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve spent about $600 million of that so far.&nbsp; So there&#8217;s more obviously left in that fund, which is why that &#8212; why we have only requested &#8212; less than 3 percent of what is in our new request package is for that type of humanitarian assistance, because we have more left and there are more global requests, of course, given the surge of refugees and needs around the world that we anticipate receiving.</p>



<p>And finally, the supplemental also provided $3 billion to support U.S. troop deployments to reinforce NATO territory, which the Department of Defense is using for this purpose.&nbsp; Of course, they plan ahead.&nbsp; It doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s all been spent out, but it has been planned for how it will be spent.</p>



<p>So, as you can tell, the vast majority of what we had requested and what we had received from Congress has been spent, and the humanitarian pieces still left accounts for how we have framed the next package.</p>



<p>Okay, go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It appears the European Union is preparing a phase-in ban of Russian oil imports.&nbsp; The U.S. has been a partner in helping the EU to get natural gas.&nbsp; Is the U.S. committed to helping them get additional crude supplies?&nbsp; And will that include ways to increase U.S. production and get it over to the European Union?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah, so as we&#8217;ve talked about a little bit this week with the announcement about Russia&#8217;s actions as it relates to Poland and Bulgaria, we started a task force last month with Europe to account for and plan for and work to help them diversify their energy needs and account for any steps that Russia may continue to take to weaponize energy.</p>



<p>There has &#8212; there was a meeting of that task force &#8211;I believe it was yesterday &#8212; to have a discussion about how we can continue to work together.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve already taken steps to provide for additional LNG or natural gas resources because we knew and anticipated that for some of these European countries, that was especially going to be a need.</p>



<p>In terms of oil &#8212; it&#8217;s, of course, a global oil market.&nbsp; So our effort there in anticipation of any needs was to take steps to provide more supply, whether that was through our own release from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, or the work that the President and his team has done to do the global release &#8212; the biggest ever in history.&nbsp; So, slightly two different things.</p>



<p>But this task force was started in anticipation of these needs.&nbsp; They already had a meeting.&nbsp; We&#8217;ll continue our work together to help the Europeans with any shortages they have and also to diversify and ease off of Russian reli- &#8212; reliance on Russian energy needs (inaudible).</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; On the E15 emergency waiver, it says it will last a statutory maximum of 20 days per the EPA and that you guys will review that as &#8212; to see if it&#8217;s still needed.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The industry itself has been calling for it and I think Biden has been supportive of a summer-long lifting of the ban.</p>



<p>I understand there&#8217;s reasons why you do the 20 days, but is this administration committed to making E15 available all summer long?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; That is how the President made his announcement and is his indica- &#8212; is his intention.&nbsp; And I would note because it&#8217;s available &#8212; if you think of the just over 2,000 gas stations where it&#8217;s available in the Midwest &#8212; largely in the Midwest &#8212; without this, the prior regulations would have been &#8212; or without the waiver, that basically the E15 pump would be covered and wouldn&#8217;t be available.</p>



<p>So, we do anticipate needs continuing for taking additional steps to cut the cost for Americans.&nbsp; This lowers it for &#8212; by about 10 cents for those who use this type of gas.&nbsp; And this is just another way to do that.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vladimir Putin has confirmed that Russia will be attending the G20 Summit.&nbsp; So could we get a reaction from the White House on that?&nbsp;</p>



<p>And then, related to that, is there any scenario &#8212; you know, anything that could happen between now and six months from now &#8212; where the U.S. would actually welcome Russia&#8217;s presence at the G20; you know, see it as being constructive or productive for Russia to be a part of that summit?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, there&#8217;s a lot that could happen between now and then, but we certainly haven&#8217;t seen an indication to date of Russia&#8217;s plan to participate in diplomatic talks constructively.</p>



<p>Our hope certainly is that will change &#8212; because, obviously, diplomatic talks and conversations is the way to bring an end to this conflict, and President Putin could end this tomorrow, could end this right now.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But I&#8217;m not going to get ahead of what that looks like.&nbsp; Obviously, this is an ongoing war on the ground.</p>



<p>We have certainly seen those reports.&nbsp; And we have &#8212; the President has expressed publicly his opposition to President Putin attending the G20.&nbsp; We have welcomed the Ukrainians attending &#8212; or invitation to attend the G20.&nbsp; It is six months away.&nbsp; So, we don&#8217;t &#8212; we don&#8217;t know how to predict &#8212; we can&#8217;t predict at this point what that will look like.</p>



<p>Our understanding &#8212; and, of course, you could confirm this with the Indonesians, as we have reached out to them privately &#8212; is that they did invite them before the invasion.&nbsp; So any additional step beyond that I would certainly point to them.&nbsp; But we&#8217;ve conveyed our view that we don&#8217;t think they should be a part of it publicly and privately as well.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just on a &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Oh, go ahead.&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; separate matter.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An American citizen and former Marine veteran, Willy Joseph Cancel, was killed this week in Ukraine while fighting alongside Ukrainian forces.&nbsp; His mother told CNN that he went to Ukraine because he believes in what Ukraine was fighting for.&nbsp; First of all, is there a message for his family?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, first of all, our hearts go out to his family and loved ones.&nbsp; We have not officially &#8212; we don&#8217;t have official confirmation, even though we&#8217;ve seen the reports.&nbsp; But we have not had that official process through the government, so I can&#8217;t speak to other specifics about him beyond that.</p>



<p>But, you know, we know Americans are looking for ways to help.&nbsp; And the reports about this individual were that he&#8217;s a veteran; some &#8212; he had a child, I believe; and certainly sounded like a very passionate young man.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We know people want to help, but we do encourage Americans to find other ways to do so rather than traveling to &#8212; rather than traveling to Ukraine to fight there.&nbsp; It is a war zone.&nbsp; It&#8217;s an active war zone.&nbsp; And we know Americans face significant risks.&nbsp; But certainly, we know a family is mourning, a wife is mourning, and our hearts are with them.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So any &#8212; any other American that is looking to go to Ukraine for the purpose of fighting alongside Ukrainian forces, the U.S.’s message is strictly, “Do not go”?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Our advice for months now has been that Americans should not travel to Ukraine for any reason.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the President&#8217;s conversation with the Me- &#8212; with AMLO, with the Mexican President, just ended.&nbsp; Did President Biden make any specific requests of his Mexican counterpart in terms of increasing Mexican either troops or enforcement along either the U.S.-Mexico border or the Mexico border with Central American countries?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, what the focus &#8212; I have not received an extensive readout yet.&nbsp; I know you will receive one probably while I&#8217;m up here.&nbsp; But the majority of the conversation was about migration and was about continued work on coordination, on economic coordination, on taking steps to reduce migration to the border.&nbsp; And they have been a partner in that over the last several months.</p>



<p>In terms of specific asks, I just don&#8217;t have more on that.&nbsp; But I know, Mike, that one of the follow-ups here will be coordination and discussion at a high level from members of their respective national security teams to continue to work together as we head toward the important meetings coming up in a few weeks.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah, I mean, I think just &#8212; as a quick follow-up, I understand that that it just ended and so maybe you don&#8217;t have the information now.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If there&#8217;s a way to get more information about the specific question of whether or not the United States has asked.&nbsp; You&#8217;ll remember President Trump pushed the Mexican government to try to &#8212; to increase enforcement along the border by threatening tariffs.&nbsp; Obviously, that&#8217;s a different strategy than &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; It’s not our approach.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It probably isn&#8217;t your approach.&nbsp; But it wouldn&#8217;t be out of the question to imagine that this government would encourage, pressure, ask the Mexican government to do more, especially on the eve of Title 42 potentially coming down, if it does.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I think it’s important to remember &#8212; I mean, the tone of the call was very constructive.&nbsp; This was not a call where President Biden was threatening the Mexican President in any way.&nbsp; They have been an important partner; we expect them to continue to be.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And this call was planned in part because of the Summit of the Americas but also because of the approaching lifting of Title 42 and the anticipation and expectation from the Department of Homeland Security of the increased influx of migrants trying to come to cross the border.</p>



<p>So &#8212; but it was meant to be a constructive call.&nbsp; It was not meant to deliver a threatening message.&nbsp; That is my understanding of what took place.&nbsp; And certainly, if there&#8217;s more to provide, we will provide that to all of you.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.&nbsp; On the supplemental budget, the administration believes the package will support Ukraine for five months.&nbsp; Is there anything you can tell us about that timeframe?&nbsp; Is that when the administration believes the war will come to an end, or that it will last for at least another five months?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, let me give you a little bit of &#8212; more of a rundown of each of the components in the package too.&nbsp; I know some of this was done yesterday, but I think more of it &#8212; we could do more from our end on this front.</p>



<p>But to answer your direct question, Weijia: This is &#8212; that’s the end of the fiscal year.&nbsp; And what our objective here was, was to provide a long enough set of funding requests or a funding request that would meet &#8212; that would mean we wouldn&#8217;t have to come back in a month or six weeks &#8212; right? &#8212; to ensure that there was planning that was possible through the U.S. military and through our European partners and the Ukrainians as well.</p>



<p>Now, some of this funding &#8212; for example, the $6 billion of this &#8212; of this $20 billion of the security assistance component &#8212; is for the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, which is basically direct support for Ukraine to purchase its own weapons from the defense &#8212; you know, defense contra- &#8212; you know, the defense industry here in the United States.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They could not even intake, you know, billions and billions and billions of weapons and security assistance in this moment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So that is likely going to be longer term, because if they place an order for specific weapons, sometimes that takes months to produce.&nbsp; It’s just meant to provide security assistance so they can plan for what they need over the long term and make those orders directly, which is what that portion of the &#8212; of the funding provides for.</p>



<p>The other portions of the funding &#8212; so, $5.4 billion &#8212; is in drawdown.&nbsp; So, that &#8212; as you&#8217;re very familiar with that because that was a large chunk of what we requested and have implemented in our last package.&nbsp; And that basically allows the United States to &#8212; when we provide weapons or give weapons to the Ukrainians, to have the funding to backfill those needs and order those weapons so we can backfill them here and make sure we have what we need here in the United States.</p>



<p>$2.4 billion was to purchase high-demand weapons for the United States, build additional critical war reserves, and increase intelligence and other defense support.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And then $4 billion is in State [Department] Foreign Military Financing, which is not just for Ukraine.&nbsp; That&#8217;s for a range of countries.&nbsp; It&#8217;s FMF funding that a range &#8212; that will be applicable to a range of countries and what their needs are.</p>



<p>And finally, $2.6 billion is to continue supporting U.S. troop deployments in NATO territory.&nbsp; So, as you know, we had 80- &#8212; about 80,000, and now we&#8217;re up to 100,000.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re also, of course, you know, providing support to a range of our NATO Allies and partners in the region.&nbsp; And that helps support that.&nbsp; It includes U.S. troop transportation, special pay, medical support.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So that&#8217;s kind of the breakdown of what it is, but some of that would certainly go beyond.&nbsp; It was just meant to be a request that accounts for the fiscal year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Got it.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And then, turning to COVID, I know you&#8217;ve talked before about protocols in place to protect the President.&nbsp; But given what Kate Bedingfield tweeted this morning, I wonder: Is part of the protocol to make sure the President never has any close contacts?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, the way we determine &#8212; we do take additional steps, and some of those are additional precautions that go beyond even what the CDC recommends.&nbsp; Right?&nbsp; So, if we are in a meeting with the President, I&#8217;ve noted before we &#8212; you always are tested.&nbsp; We often wear masks &#8212; almost always wear masks in those meetings.&nbsp; We are &#8212; try to socially distance whenever possible.</p>



<p>And the way the CDC defines a “close contact” is 15 minutes at a certain &#8212; a close proximity.&nbsp; So we try to follow those guidelines and take additional steps, of course, as a &#8212; out of an effort to protect the President.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, those who are in a confined space with the President wear masks and are six feet apart from him?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; That&#8217;s an effort we make, exactly.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay, great.</p>



<p>And then, just quickly on the vaccines for children &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; because the FDA announced a couple potential dates for when they might start reviewing in June.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the greenlight is given, assuming it will be, is there enough supply already on hand to start giving these young children their first doses right away &#8212; the supply of both the vaccine and vials, materials, et cetera?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; My understanding, Weijia, is that there is.&nbsp; I will quadruple-check that and make sure for you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But we have been planning for the possibility of approval for vaccines for children under five for some time now, and we like to plan ahead.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Go ahead, Jacqui.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.&nbsp; The mayor of Eagle Pass told my colleague down at the border today &#8212; and the mayor is a Democrat, by the way &#8212; that the border is not being effectively managed and asked the President to come and see it.&nbsp; Does the President have any plans to go to the border?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have any plans to preview at this point in time.&nbsp; Certainly, we&#8217;re open to it, but no plans to preview.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it something he would consider doing before the Summit of the Americas, where he&#8217;s set to meet with the leaders of Central and South America, see the situation firsthand before having that robust conversation?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, he&#8217;s meeting with leaders of countries that he&#8217;s traveled to many times, and certainly he is very familiar with the issues that will be discussed, which is addressing root causes, coordinating &#8212; whether it&#8217;s on the economic front or security front.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And that&#8217;s an initiative he led during the &#8212; when he was Vice President, so he&#8217;s very familiar with those issues.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the economy: Austan Goolsbee, the former Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers under the Obama administration, said that he felt that the President yesterday in his comments about the GDP report was potentially underplaying the risks of a recession.&nbsp; And he pointed to geopolitical conditions with Ukraine, with Russia cutting off gas to Europe, and also the GDP shrinking, saying that people should be nervous.&nbsp; How do you respond to that?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I have a great deal of respect for Austan Goolsbee &#8212; he’s a former colleague &#8212; and so does the President.&nbsp; But what we look at is a range of economic data, including economic data that was in the GDP numbers yesterday, which I did some explaining of yesterday.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But some of the data that was in there show very encouraging signs that economists look at &#8212; independent &#8212; many independent economists monitor closely.&nbsp; American consumer spending, business investment, residential investment &#8212; all up.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The decrease, as it relates to exports, is largely because our economy is stronger than many economies around the world.&nbsp; And the inventory numbers, which is kind of the number that went down &#8212; that brought it down &#8212; is in large &#8212; a large &#8212; in large part because the fourth quarter inventory numbers were the highest in history, and these numbers are drawn &#8212; are done as a comparison from quarter to quarter.</p>



<p>So I think we felt it was important to explain the data and what it means.&nbsp; We continue to monitor economic data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s important to note that the &#8212; some important components of it are: We created more jobs last year than any <s>job</s> [year] in American history.&nbsp; We’re at a low &#8212; a very low unemployment rate.&nbsp; And while costs are high and inflation is not where we want it to be, the Federal Reserve continues to project that will come down by the end of the year.</p>



<p>So our economists and our economic team continues to feel confident in the strength of the economy even as we monitor a range of data.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jennifer Granholm said something, though, that was interesting about inflation coming down.&nbsp; She said, “Some economists are suggesting inflation is going to level off a bit, but it&#8217;s just so hard to know because we don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going to happen on the war on this.”&nbsp; So, she&#8217;s seeming to also allude to geopolitical conditions that might not result in these projections coming to fruition.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, the Federal Reserve makes the official projections &#8212; right? &#8212; for the government.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What I will note, and I think maybe she was referring to, is: Even the new economic data we saw today &#8212; energy accounted for 61 percent of the reasoning for the increase in the inflation numbers.&nbsp; And we know that because of Putin&#8217;s unprovoked invasion in Ukraine, that it&#8217;s driving food costs but also energy costs, and that is a huge driver.</p>



<p>So that&#8217;s why the President is taking a range of steps: the historic release from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve; even the steps, certainly smaller, as it relates to E15 today to work to really target and focus on energy prices and costs.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then I have just a couple questions on the Disinformation Board.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yesterday, you had told me that you were not familiar with Nina Jankowicz.&nbsp; I&#8217;m wondering if you&#8217;re &#8212; if you have more information on her today.</p>



<p>Also, Secretary Mayorkas said that he was not familiar with statements that she had made surrounding the Hunter Biden laptop.&nbsp; And I&#8217;m just wondering: How was she hired if you and the White House are not familiar with her, if Mayorkas is not familiar with her statements?&nbsp; What&#8217;s the process for putting her into a position like this?&nbsp; Who&#8217;s in charge of her hiring?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, let me give you a sense of who she is.&nbsp; She&#8217;s an expert on online disinformation.&nbsp; She was formerly in the Wilson Center&#8217;s Disinfor- &#8212; she was formerly a Disinformation Fellow at the Wilson Center.&nbsp; She&#8217;s testified before Congress as well as the United Kingdom and European parliaments; advised a Ukrainian foreign minister &#8212; particularly relevant in this moment &#8212; under the auspices of a Fulbright Public Policy Fellowship; and overseen Russia and Belarus programs at the National Democratic Institute.</p>



<p>Any hiring decisions are up to the Department of Homeland Security, but this is a person with extensive qualifications.</p>



<p>What I will tell you about the board and what the board is doing: This is a continuation of work that began at the Department of Homeland Security in 2020 under former President Trump.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it though &#8212; I guess, can you describe what her job is going to be?&nbsp; Because there&#8217;s been some TikToks that she has put out, and it seems like rather than, you know, calling balls and strikes on “this, you know, story is false and this story &#8212; and here&#8217;s the truth on it,” one line stood out to me: “They&#8217;re laundering disinfo and we should really take note, and not support their lives with our wallet, voice, or vote.”&nbsp; So is &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, here&#8217;s what the board is going to do, which I think is of particular interest &#8212; again, a continuation of the work of the former President.&nbsp; So for anyone who&#8217;s critical of it, I didn&#8217;t hear them being critical of the work under the former President, which is just interesting to note contextually.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But in the fact sheet that they put out, what they noted yesterday &#8212; what they noted in there is that this is meant to &#8212; one, the first bullet was about protecting privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties, and the First Amendment.&nbsp; They said the primary mission is to establish best practices to ensure that efforts to understand and respond to disinformation are done in ways that protect privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties.</p>



<p>I&#8217;d also note that the first example they gave about what they&#8217;re going to do is support the Department of Homeland Security&#8217;s work &#8212; ongoing work, back to the former administration &#8212; on &#8212; to address how and understand how misinformation is spread by human smugglers that prey on vulnerable populations attempting to migrate to the United States.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There&#8217;s no question &#8212; everybody &#8212; that bipartisan support for that, to address disinformation that&#8217;s going &#8212; that&#8217;s helping smugglers pushing, helping people migrate or providing false information, prompting people to migrate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So &#8212; and this is also work that is helping to address unauthorized &#8212; terrorism, other threats, and see how disinformation and misinformation is being pushed to lead &#8212; to increase those.&nbsp; So that&#8217;s all work &#8212; we think it’s work that&#8217;s been ongoing for some time.&nbsp; This is the form it&#8217;s taking.&nbsp; And there&#8217;s a fact sheet that details the specifics of it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You just outlined a lot of, you know, efforts that sound very worthy, but you&#8217;ve got some from the Home- &#8212; the Department of Homeland Security telling people how they should vote.&nbsp; How do you explain that to critics who say “That doesn&#8217;t sound right to me”?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; This is an individual who will overse- &#8212; be overseeing the work of that board.&nbsp; Personnel decisions are up to the Department of Homeland Security.&nbsp; I just outlined the extensive history and background this individual has.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But I think what&#8217;s important to note here is what the board is doing, which is continuing what is important disinformation-related work that began under the former administration.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; I want to ask you about some of the concerns that Democrats are expressing about Title 42, if it is, in fact, lifted.&nbsp; And these are some quotes that were in Politico today:&nbsp;</p>



<p>Maggie Hassan says, “What I didn’t hear… [were] specifics about numbers and deployment and really meeting the need” at the border.</p>



<p>Senator Catherine Cortez Masto said she still hasn&#8217;t seen a “comprehensive plan.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>And Senator Mark Kelly has said, “There’s having things on a piece of paper and then what is going on on the southern border &#8212; and there is a huge disconnect.”</p>



<p>&nbsp; What is the administration doing to address those concerns and that criticism that there may be a plan on paper, but they certainly haven&#8217;t seen it at the border yet?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, first, there&#8217;s an extensive plan on paper that includes a six-pillar approach to planning for and preparing for the lifting of Title 42, including surging resources, personnel, transportation, medical support, facilities to support border operations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It also includes enhancing CBP processing efficiency and moving with deliberate speed to mitigate potential overcrowding at Border Patrol stations &#8212; something in anticipation they are preparing for the possibility of.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It also includes administering consequences for unlawful entry.&nbsp; That&#8217;s pillar three.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It includes &#8212; number four is bolstering the capacity of nongovernmental organizations, who have been important partners to us as we&#8217;re working to implement &#8212; to receive non-citizens after they&#8217;ve been processed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It also includes targeting and disrupting the transnational criminal organizations.</p>



<p>And finally, deterring irregular migration.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What it is not &#8212; and this is where we absolutely, of course, agree with these members and others &#8212; is an immigration reform plan.&nbsp; And that is something that we strongly support.&nbsp; This is a reminder of the need for &#8212; how outdated it is, how broken the system is.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But Title 42 has never been an immigration plan.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How soon will the plan that you just laid out actually go into effect?&nbsp; Understanding that it may take some time, but &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; how soon will people actually feel the real impact so that, as Senator Kelly is saying, this disconnect doesn&#8217;t exist, so that there&#8217;s actual proof that it&#8217;s taking place?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, the Title 42 lifts on May 23rd.&nbsp; It doesn&#8217;t lift &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So nothing happens until the (inaudible).</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I would point you to the Department of Homeland Security for the implementation plan.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But I think that&#8217;s what&#8217;s important to note here.&nbsp; We haven&#8217;t seen, you know, the impacts of the lifting surges because it hasn&#8217;t happened yet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I&#8217;d also note that Secretary Mayorkas testified, I believe, before four committees over the last two days about exactly this &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And yet, there’s still this skepticism.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; &#8212; in order to answer their questions.&nbsp; And I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;s happy to have continued conversations.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And how concerned is the President that these members of his own party &#8212; who are facing tough reelection battles, as you know &#8212; have these serious concerns and clearly are expressing fears that it might impact them politically &#8212; might impact their chances for reelection?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, without speaking to the politics, I would say, Kristen: I mean, the President shares the concern about the lack of a workable immigration system, and that impacts many of the border state leaders quite a bit, of course, because there isn&#8217;t an effective asylum processing system; because we don&#8217;t have smart security and we spent years investing in a faulty border wall that was never going to be an effective mechanism.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He shares their concerns about that, and he recognizes and agrees with that.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How would you characterize how committed he is?&nbsp; Understanding that an appeal, if it comes to that &#8212; it&#8217;s not in his hands &#8212; would he want to see this fight go all the way to the Supreme Court?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I&#8217;m certainly not going to get ahead of a legal process.&nbsp; I will note &#8212; and Mary &#8212; I think MaryAlice asked about this yesterday.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So let me &#8212; in terms of where things stand: So, right now what we saw yesterday is that the district court presiding over one of the challenges to the Title 42 rescission order officially entered &#8212; finally officially entered, because they just done it verbally &#8212; a temporary restraining order.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What that basically means is they&#8217;re saying we can&#8217;t lift Title 42 before May 23rd.&nbsp; That has not been our plan to date, as you know.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What is next is there&#8217;s going to be a hearing on Arizona&#8217;s preliminary injunction motion.&nbsp; That&#8217;s scheduled to take place on May 13th.&nbsp; So, any decision about what&#8217;s next, of course, would happen from the Department of Justice but wouldn&#8217;t happen after &#8212; until after that.</p>



<p>What I would note is that the judge has indicated he will rule unfavorably towards the administration at this time, but we don&#8217;t know &#8212; and we don&#8217;t officially know and we won&#8217;t know &#8212; until he makes a ruling, and then Department of Justice would make any decision about legal action.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One quickly on the supplemental, if I might.&nbsp; There&#8217;s obviously a divide over whether to link it to COVID funding, which we talked about a little bit here yesterday.&nbsp; But given that there is this divide and given the urgency that we are hearing from President Zelenskyy and others on the ground in Ukraine for this aid, why not just say, “Let&#8217;s de-link these two bills and move forward with the Ukraine aid and get it done as quickly as possible”?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, Kristen, I would note that the President feels that both are urgent, both are emergencies.&nbsp; Of course, the &#8212; we know there&#8217;s an urgency in getting additional assistance.&nbsp; We know we have a few more weeks depending on how the final military drawdown is spent out.</p>



<p>But in terms of COVID, what we are doing right now is we are preventing the United States from being able to plan and purchase ahead.&nbsp; So, for example, if there&#8217;s a better booster &#8212; which there may be, because science is amazing &#8212; one day, right? &#8212; if there&#8217;s a better vaccine, we can&#8217;t make purchases ahead of doing that.&nbsp; That is what we have done to date.&nbsp; That is why we have been so prepared.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It also makes it so that we can&#8217;t purchase Evusheld treatments that helps immunocompromised.&nbsp; We can&#8217;t make additional purchases of a range of the treatments we know are effective and make sure that we can say to every American, “We&#8217;ll get you a mask.&nbsp; We&#8217;ll get you a test.&nbsp; We&#8217;ll get you a free vaccine.”&nbsp; So, the President feels that is also incredibly urgent.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you have a reaction to the report that the FBI last year potentially searched millions of Americans’ data?&nbsp; And secondly, is the President briefed on that?&nbsp; Does he have any reaction himself?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I have not spoken with the President about this.&nbsp; I can get you more details about this after the briefing.</p>



<p>My understanding is that some of this was about researching and doing an investigation into potential hacking and &#8212; so &#8212; but I will get you more from the FBI after this.&nbsp; Thanks for your question.</p>



<p>Go ahead.&nbsp; Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; E15 fuel is slightly less energy dense than what we consider typical gasoline, so Americans might need to fill up just a little bit more frequently.&nbsp; So how much did the &#8212; does the administration really think that this move will affect Americans’ wallets?&nbsp;</p>



<p>And does the White House believe the President has exhausted his authority on what he can do related to gas prices or are there more options still being considered?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I mean, on the second question, we&#8217;re always going to look for more options.&nbsp; I mean, we saw &#8212; and I talked about this a little bit earlier, even as it relates to the recent &#8212; the inflation data that came out today. We know that 61 percent of that is driven by the price &#8212; by energy costs, by Putin&#8217;s invasion into Ukraine.&nbsp; And we need to continue to take every step we can whether that&#8217;s working with Congress, considering what authorities we have, continuing to ensure we take steps to make sure the supply meets the demand out there.</p>



<p>You know, the estimates have been: It saves Americans about 10 cents a gallon.&nbsp; And you know that, to the President and to us, felt like a reason to do it.&nbsp; And because without taking the step for the waiver, it basically would just be an option of additional supply that is a little bit less expensive that wouldn&#8217;t be available in these 2,000 gas stations.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re not saying that this is like the silver bullet; it&#8217;s not.&nbsp; It&#8217;s just a step that we felt would help ease the &#8212; ease the burden for Americans who go to those gas stations.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; And then, with COVID, on &#8212; as we are talking about &#8212; as the White House is pushing Congress to pass for more funding, why hasn&#8217;t the administration released a plan, at least for now, to transition the burden of paying for COVID drugs and vaccines to the private sector, kind of like has been done with tests, so that insurance companies have time to negotiate?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, there&#8217;s a range of steps happening at the same time.&nbsp; But I will tell you that what we want to continue to be able to do is to provide these treatments for free.&nbsp; That&#8217;s the objective.&nbsp; That&#8217;s the reason for this request for funding.&nbsp; But also, the request for funding is enabling the United States to be able to purchase ahead in bulk supply a lot of these treatments or, you know, vaccines so that we can make &#8212; when they are ready, we can make those available to treatment centers and hospitals around the country.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; I know you said that you didn&#8217;t get an extensive readout yet of the conversation with the Mexican President &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; And they’ll be a written readout at some point, not yet.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To the extent that you know &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; what happened, did the President make any headway in getting Mexico to take a harder line on Russia?&nbsp; And should we expect them to join the global coalition in imposing sanctions now?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would note, obviously, the Mexican government can speak for themselves on any intentions they may or may not have.&nbsp; They have spoken out against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, so I would note that.</p>



<p>We will always encourage any leaders to take additional steps to support the Ukrainians and stand up in a range of ways against the &#8212; the invasion of Ukraine by Russia.</p>



<p>But in terms of any steps they would take, regardless of the conversation, we would let them speak for themselves on that front.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sorry.&nbsp; Has the reticence by the Mexican government impacted the U.S.-Mexico relationship in any way when it comes to sanctions?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, again, I would note they have spoken out against Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine.&nbsp; We know different countries are going to take different steps.&nbsp; Some have taken them quickly.&nbsp; Some took longer to take them.&nbsp; And we know different countries have different approaches to every step &#8212; whether it&#8217;s sanctions, assistance they can provide.&nbsp; We understand that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have an important, strong relationship with Mexico &#8212; one that the call today was set up in order to really focus the conversation on migration and addressing root causes in advance of the Summit of the Americas.&nbsp; So that was really the majority of the conversation.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m sorry, I didn&#8217;t mean to miss you.&nbsp; Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No worries.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; So, Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby was asked this afternoon if he believed that Vladimir Putin was a rational actor.&nbsp; And he responded saying, “I can&#8217;t talk to his psychology, but I think we can all speak to his depravity.”&nbsp; Now, he later apologized for his emotions there.&nbsp; But I&#8217;m curious: Are these sentiments also shared by the President?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I think you&#8217;ve heard the President call him a war criminal.&nbsp; So, I don&#8217;t think the President thinks of President Putin as somebody who is a model in the world.&nbsp; He feels &#8212; he views him as a pariah and somebody who is guilty of war crimes and of genocide.&nbsp; So, I think the President&#8217;s comments speak for itself.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then also, piggybacking on Kristen’s last question: If Congress doesn’t pass supplemental aid to Ukraine or it&#8217;s delayed, how much longer can we keep the current pace in supporting them?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, there&#8217;s a range of ways we&#8217;re supporting them, right?&nbsp; So this is why I felt it was important to outline in more detail than I did yesterday.&nbsp; Sometimes you go back and you say, “I need more information.”&nbsp; Right?&nbsp; But &#8212; and that&#8217;s what we did here.&nbsp; But we know we there&#8217;s $250 million left &#8212; right? &#8212; from the security package.</p>



<p>We know that we were giving &#8212; we were at a very rapid pace of providing assistance for several weeks.&nbsp; That was strategic because we wanted to frontload that, knowing that as Russia repositioned their approach to the war, the needs for the Ukrainians were different because it was going to be a longer, more drawn-out war that was more kind of on the ground.</p>



<p>So, we strategically frontloaded a lot of the security assistance.&nbsp; But there is not &#8212; we expect a couple more weeks this assistance could be.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have the plans from the Department of Defense on exactly how they will &#8212; how they will roll that out.</p>



<p>I also noted that the vast, vast majority of our economic assistance has also been exhausted.&nbsp; Obviously, many of those &#8212; many of those needs are long term.&nbsp; Some of the funding &#8212; about $3 billion of it was for operating needs of the Department of Defense.&nbsp; Some of those are still being spent out and are part of their budget, not direct assistance, of course.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And then there are still &#8212; there is still funds in the humanitarian assistance bucket, but that doesn&#8217;t meet all of the needs, of course, that the Ukrainians have.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So this is why there&#8217;s an urgency to moving forward.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gotcha.&nbsp; And lastly, I understand that the circumstances surrounding Mr. Cancel’s are still coming to light.&nbsp; But does the President have any plans to talk with his relatives?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; It&#8217;s a great question.&nbsp; And what I tried to convey &#8212; perhaps, not articulately &#8212; is that it has not gone through the proper channels that typically are the State Department, Defense Department, et cetera.&nbsp; Usually, the State Department, likely, in this case.&nbsp; And if there is a call to read out, I will certainly let all of you know.</p>



<p>Go ahead.&nbsp; I can do like a few more, I think.&nbsp; Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, it sounds like the President is still planning to attend the White House Correspondents’ Dinner.&nbsp; In the past when he&#8217;s been exposed in large events, the White House has noted that there might be an increase in his testing following those.&nbsp; Are there any plans to change the President&#8217;s testing procedures following these big events that he&#8217;s been attending, like the dinner and the two memorial services he attended?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; The testing protocol is determined by his doctor.&nbsp; He was tested yesterday, and he tested negative.&nbsp; But I don&#8217;t have anything to predict in terms of the future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I noted this the other day, but I think it&#8217;s important for your question here, is that the President &#8212; we made a decision &#8212; it was important to him to attend the dinner to honor the work of journalists &#8212; all of you, many of your colleagues around the world &#8212; something the former President didn&#8217;t do.</p>



<p>But we also took additional steps.&nbsp; He&#8217;s not attending the dinner portion.&nbsp; He&#8217;s coming for the program.&nbsp; So &#8212; and he will likely wear a mask when he&#8217;s not speaking.&nbsp; Obviously, he&#8217;ll speak.&nbsp; And so he&#8217;ll be there for about an hour or 90 minutes, I guess, depending on how long Trevor Noah speaks and others speak in the program.&nbsp; But we took that additional step as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And then he&#8217;s, of course, sitting on the dais up in the front.&nbsp; So the interaction &#8212; he&#8217;s not attending any of the receptions or anything along those lines either.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, on the remarks, the President has been a guest on several late-night shows.&nbsp; Has he consulted any of those hosts, comedians, brought in any outside help on his speech?&nbsp; Can you kind of bring us in the room on how he&#8217;s approaching this as someone who has attended several of these dinners and seen them play out?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; He has.&nbsp; I will tell you the President has a very good sense of humor and is working hard on his own speech.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.&nbsp; The administration has not said how long they expect the war in Ukraine to last, and that&#8217;s understandable because no one knows what the &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; future will hold.&nbsp; But the administration &#8212; and then also in this room yesterday &#8212; the administration has declined to say how much the United States is prepared to spend long term or to give a real definition of what a victory in the war in Ukraine would look like.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So my question is: How long does President Biden, the same President who got us out of Afghanistan because he said it was a costly and unwinnable quagmire &#8212; how long does he expect the American people to back this war when they don&#8217;t know how long it will last, how much it will cost, or what the ultimate definition of victory actually is?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I mean, let me just reiterate something the President has said from the beginning.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Inaudible.)&nbsp; Right.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; And I will get to your point.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And these are some of the questions.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; But this &#8212; I will get to your questions, I promise.&nbsp; That combating Russian aggression has costs.&nbsp; Leaving it unchecked would be even more costly.&nbsp; Allowing Russia to run rampant around Europe beyond Ukraine, which is what President Putin outlined in his speech right before he invaded, would be incredibly costly to the world and to the United States.&nbsp; We calculate that as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Right now, I know &#8212; let me &#8212; I will get there.&nbsp; I promise.&nbsp; I know you&#8217;re raising your hand.&nbsp; You asked me a few questions.&nbsp; I&#8217;m going to get there.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Right now, the importance of this package to the President is because, every day, Ukrainians pay the price of freedom in their lives, and he feels providing them with arms and food is the right thing to do.&nbsp; And trying to plan for &#8212; and I noted that some components of this package are not limited.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not that the spending will end at five months.&nbsp; It&#8217;s just allowing the ability for us, the Ukrainians, and the Europeans to plan over the long term.&nbsp; In fact, much of the security assistance will be much longer than that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The reason it&#8217;s difficult to define what winning is is because, obviously, our view continues to be that an ends will be through a diplomatic process and a diplomatic conversation.&nbsp; The Ukrainians are the ones who determine what the outcome of that will look like, not for us to determine on their behalf.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So should we expect a line-item appropriation for military aid to Ukraine for the next 5, 10, 15 years?&nbsp; I mean, is this open ended?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We, of course, want the war to end as quickly as possible, and President Putin could do that tomorrow.&nbsp; But right now, what we&#8217;re making a decision about, what we&#8217;re advocating for is trying to support and have the backs of an incredibly brave country and their people who are kicked out of their homes; fighting an aggressive dictator and his military; lacking food, lacking economic assistance; and preventing Putin from rampaging through Europe, which by the way, would be much more expensive than what we&#8217;re talking about here.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And one quick follow-up then.&nbsp; So the United States’ definition of what success or victory looks like in the region is contingent on how long the Ukrainians are willing to combat the Russians and whether or not they want to, you know, fight them and force them to the negotiation table or push them out of, you know, their borders?&nbsp; That&#8217;s up to them?&nbsp; But we’re &#8212; we’re on board?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; It’s not exactly what I said.&nbsp; What I will say is that what President Putin defined as his own version of winning and victory from the beginning was taking over Ukraine, their sovereignty, their territorial integrity.</p>



<p>Obviously, he&#8217;s already failed at that.&nbsp; Right?&nbsp; So in that sense, they are already defeating Putin&#8217;s effort to envelop them into Russia.&nbsp; But this is an ongoing war.&nbsp; We know that.&nbsp; We know that diplomacy and having a discussion and negotiation is the way to get an end to it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our effort and our focus is on strengthening them at the negotiating table, and that&#8217;s the role that we feel that we can play.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I&#8217;m going to have to wrap this up.&nbsp; Asma, go ahead.&nbsp; One more.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Oh, and Asma, just &#8212; you asked me a question yesterday about credit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; That is not possible.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; I did get that from (inaudible).</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Good.&nbsp; But for others.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; So there have been reports that EU countries are looking to approve a phased embargo on Russian oil as early as next week.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And if that were to happen, it would be huge.&nbsp; And I am curious how the White House is coordinating with the EU on this.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; So one of the steps that the President took last month was to start this task force with the Europeans.</p>



<p>I mean, we took steps before that &#8212; right? &#8212; to work with a range of countries in Asia and around the world to provide additional supply &#8212; LNG supply &#8212; where they had excess.</p>



<p>Japan, for example, did that to provide excess LNG supply because they had the ability to do that to the Europeans in anticipation that Russia could weaponize energy, as we&#8217;ve seen President Putin do.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There was a meeting of this task force yesterday to continue that coordination, have that discussion, and we&#8217;re just looking for ways that we can help them address these needs that we long anticipated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Okay.&nbsp; Thanks, everyone.&nbsp; Thank you, everyone.</p>
