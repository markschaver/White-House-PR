<p>We, President of the United States of America Joseph R. Biden and President of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin, note the United States and Russia have demonstrated that, even in periods of tension, they are able to make progress on our shared goals of ensuring predictability in the strategic sphere, reducing the risk of armed conflicts and the threat of nuclear war.</p>



<p>The recent extension of the New START Treaty exemplifies our commitment to nuclear arms control. Today, we reaffirm the principle that a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought.</p>



<p>Consistent with these goals, the United States and Russia will embark together on an integrated bilateral Strategic Stability Dialogue in the near future that will be deliberate and robust. Through this Dialogue, we seek to lay the groundwork for future arms control and risk reduction measures.</p>

<p>Dreamers are Americans.&nbsp; Many have spent most of their lives in the United States.&nbsp; They live, study, work, and worship in our communities.&nbsp; They have served on the frontlines during the COVID-19 pandemic.<br>&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2012, the Obama-Biden Administration created the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) policy.&nbsp; Since that date, DACA has allowed more than 800,000 immigrant youth who came to the United States as children to temporarily remain in our country, work lawfully, pursue their education and long for the day they could become citizens.</p>



<p>Twenty years ago, Congress introduced the first version of the bipartisan Dream Act, led by Senator Durbin (D-IL) and former Republican Senator Hatch.&nbsp; And over the years, bipartisan coalitions of lawmakers championed this bill.&nbsp; The&nbsp; American public overwhelmingly supports this legislation. But time and time again, the Senate has failed to act.</p>



<p>Only Congress can provide a permanent legislative fix to provide lasting stability for these young people and their families.  My immigration bill, the U.S. Citizenship Act, creates a pathway to citizenship for undocumented individuals in our country, including Dreamers.  In March, the House took a critical first step and passed the American Dream and Promise Act.   Congress must find a way to pass these legislative solutions and I will continue to work towards passage of legislation protecting Dreamers and creating a path to citizenship for  undocumented immigrants. These young people represent the best of America and we can’t let them down.</p>

<p>The Biden-Harris administration is working to rebuild our immigration system after four years of chaos and mismanagement. The trend of border apprehensions in <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/national-media-release/cbp-announces-may-2021-operational-update">May</a> is a reduction of individuals (unique encounters) and families below the peak in 2019. Border numbers fluctuate, however, based on annual migration trends and that is why this administration is working to establish lawful pathways for individuals to migrate or seek protection, address the root causes of migration, restore fair, orderly and humane means to apply for asylum and deter irregular migration. The administration has made significant progress at establishing a well-managed and secure border while also treating people fairly and humanely.&nbsp; The American people support this approach.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Improved Processing of Unaccompanied Children&nbsp;</strong><ul><li>The administration successfully reduced the number of unaccompanied children in U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) facilities <strong>from 5,676 in late March to 570 </strong>on June 14<strong>.</strong></li><li>The administration reduced the average amount of time children are in CBP facilities to <strong>26 hours, compared with 131 hours on April 1<sup>st</sup>.</strong></li><li>The administration has reduced the number of unaccompanied children in the care of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to <strong>under 16,000 from over 22,000 in late April.</strong><br></li></ul></li><li><strong>Removed Barriers to Unifying Children with Parents and Sponsors</strong><ul><li>HHS has surged case management resources to <strong>dramatically increase the rates by which children are united with their sponsors</strong>.</li><li>DHS and HHS <strong>rescinded an agreement from the former administration</strong> that subjected undocumented parents to immigration enforcement when they came forward to claim their child.</li><li>HHS <strong>expanded access to fingerprinting sites</strong> to conduct background checks on sponsors that has resulted in reduced backlogs and long-distance travel for sponsors.</li><li>With support from the United States Digital Service, HHS implemented <strong>the UC Bed Census</strong> that assists facilities and licensed providers with <strong>reporting bed capacity data, thereby improving bed count accuracy and data collection</strong>.<br></li></ul></li><li><strong>Put in Place Orderly Processes and Protocols at the Border</strong><ul><li>Through support and coordination with the Government of Mexico, the Department of State (State), and international organization partners, DHS has successfully processed over <strong>11,900 eligible people who had been returned to Mexico under the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) </strong>to reenter the United States to pursue their active U.S. immigration cases in a safe and orderly manner.</li><li>DHS has developed a partnership model, working with community-based organizations, cities, and counties <strong>to ensure that family units and single adults released from DHS custody are COVID tested and isolated in compliance with CDC recommendations.</strong></li></ul></li><li><strong>Expanded Lawful Pathways for Protection and Opportunity</strong><ul><li>DHS announced the availability of <strong>6,000 temporary, non-agricultural worker – or H-2B – visas</strong> for nationals of Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala for FY 2021.</li><li>State and DHS <strong>reopened the Central American Minors (CAM) program</strong> to reunite children who are nationals of El Salvador, Guatemala or Honduras with their parents in the U.S. through refugee resettlement or humanitarian parole.

partner organizations to <strong>promote humane practices in labor migration agreements</strong> in the region.&nbsp; In late May, 61 participants from 11 RCM member countries, the private sector, and civil society organizations exchanged best practices on fair recruitment and protection of migrant workers.<br></li></ul></li><li><strong>Enhanced Migration Management</strong><ul><li>On June 10, the U.S. Government announced an additional $57 million in funds, including $46 million the President authorized from the Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance Fund, to support <strong>urgent humanitarian needs of vulnerable refugees and migrants in Central America</strong> and third countries in the region, including the compounding effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on forced displacement.&nbsp; <strong>This builds on the $310 million in humanitarian support for the region announced in April.</strong>&nbsp;</li><li>The Department of State opened the first <strong>Migration Resource Center (MRC)</strong> in Guatemala to provide individuals with protection screenings and referrals to asylum, refugee resettlement, and parole options.&nbsp; The MRC will also have referrals for labor and reintegration programs for individuals who do not have protection needs.</li><li>The Department of Justice, with support from the Department of State, will create a <strong>regional task force to identify, disrupt, and prevent migrant smuggling and human trafficking operations</strong>.&nbsp;</li><li>DHS implemented “Operation Sentinel” – a U.S. government effort to <strong>crack down on international criminal organizations engaged in migrant smuggling </strong>by targeting their ability to travel, trade, and access financial assets in the United States. &nbsp;</li><li>On her trip to Guatemala, the Vice President announced a new <strong>Human Smuggling and Trafficking Task Force</strong> that will identify, disrupt, and prevent migrant smuggling and human trafficking operations.</li><li>On her trip to Mexico, the Vice President announced that U.S. and Mexican law enforcement agencies will partner to exchange information and take appropriate actions to address the shared priority of <strong>disabling human trafficking and human smuggling organizations.</strong></li><li>Mexico is <strong>increasing border checkpoints</strong> and <strong>deployed more than 12,000 security personnel to southern Mexico</strong>.</li><li>Mexico <strong>received 31,800 asylum requests</strong> from January to April, compared to 18,500 during the same period in 2019.</li><li>State has nearly <strong>quadrupled the number of radio ads in Central America</strong> to discourage irregular migration compared to January.&nbsp; State continues to run a comprehensive digital marketing campaign in the region, emphasizing the value of staying with family and building a better life at home.<br></li></ul></li><li><strong>Addressed the Root Causes of Migration</strong><ul><li>Demonstrated a strong U.S. commitment to good governance by <strong>redirecting&nbsp;funding for certain Salvadoran government institutions</strong> in response to democratic backsliding.</li><li>On her trip to Guatemala, the Vice President announced that the Department of Justice, with support from the Department of State, will create an <strong>anticorruption task force</strong> that will include U.S. prosecutors and law enforcement experts to investigate and prosecute corruption cases with a nexus in the United States, Guatemala, and the region.&nbsp;</li><li>On her trip to Guatemala, the Vice President announced that USAID and DFC will provide up to <strong>$48M in U.S. government resources to advance economic opportunity in Guatemala</strong> through support for entrepreneurs and innovators, expanding access to affordable housing, agricultural businesses, and development of micro, small, and medium enterprises.</li><li>USAID launched a three-year regional initiative to support local partners in the Northern Triangle to <strong>increase community resilience</strong> in the face of poverty, violence, poor governance, corruption, and climate change.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>To increase security in the region, <strong>USAID trained police officers</strong> on domestic violence procedures, trained investigators and analysts on the prosecution of human smuggling cases, and State Department-supported partners <strong>identified 19 human smugglers</strong> with outstanding warrants in the United States.</li><li>On her trip to Guatemala, the Vice President announced that USAID will provide up to $40 million over three years to launch the <strong>Young Women’s Empowerment Initiative that will focus on creating opportunities for young, primarily indigenous women.&nbsp;</strong></li><li>On her trip to Mexico, the Vice President witnessed the signing of an MOU between the United States and Mexico. &nbsp;This MOU establishes a partnership to <strong>address the lack of economic opportunities in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras by fostering agricultural development and youth empowerment programs</strong> in these countries to address the root causes of migration.<br></li></ul></li></ul>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Aboard Air Force One<br>En Route Geneva, Switzerland</p>



<p>3:58 P.M. CEST<br>&nbsp;<br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Okay, welcome to our flight to Geneva, Switzerland, on day seven of a lovely trip.<br>&nbsp;<br>I’m going to start by just giving an overview of the logistics for tomorrow so you all have an understanding of what the day looks like.<br>&nbsp;<br>So, around 1:00 p.m., President Putin is expected to arrive &#8212; should be the first to arrive at the villa where the event is taking place, where the meeting is taking place.&nbsp; He will be greeted by the Swiss President on arrival and taken inside.&nbsp; President Biden will arrive after President Putin and will also be taken back inside.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Inside, they&#8217;ll share a short greeting with the Swiss President.&nbsp; They will, all three of them, walk back outside where there will be a &#8212; there will be press present for that moment.&nbsp; The only person who is expected to speak during that moment is the Swiss President.<br>&nbsp;<br>They will then go back inside and they will move into a smaller meeting &#8212; P plus one &#8212; on both sides.&nbsp; Then, after that meeting, there will be &#8212; there&#8217;s expected to be &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The P plus one, just a translator?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; The plus one is the Secretary of State.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Who doesn’t speak Russian.<br>&nbsp;<br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; There you go.<br>&nbsp;<br>Then there is a plan for there to be an expanded portion of the meeting, which is P plus five.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>I&#8217;m not going to give you the breakdown of time; we&#8217;ll see how the day goes tomorrow.<br>&nbsp;<br>After the meeting concludes &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do we go into these photo ops?<br>&nbsp;<br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Sorry, that&#8217;s a good question.&nbsp; There will be a spray of the first P-plus-one portion of the day.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the P plus five, who else is in?<br>&nbsp;<br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; We will get you that list.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But only a spray on the P plus one?<br>&nbsp;<br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Correct.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The spray will be before or after the P plus one?<br>&nbsp;<br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Before.&nbsp; At the beginning.<br>&nbsp;<br>After the meeting concludes, as you all know, we expect President Putin to do his own press conference.&nbsp; I will let them confirm that, but I believe that&#8217;s the plan.&nbsp; And then President Biden will do a press conference after that.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Those are the logistics.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Let me just also preface from the beginning, just for your expectations: We are not going to go much farther than where the President went during his press conference yesterday in terms of previewing the meeting.&nbsp; We are going to let him speak to that when he concludes the meeting tomorrow.&nbsp; But we still wanted to give an opportunity to have a discussion and provide any clarification as needed.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Inaudible) question &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Yes.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; P plus one: POTUS, Blinken, and a translator?&nbsp; The translators don&#8217;t count in the numbers?<br>&nbsp;<br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Correct.&nbsp; And an interpreter.&nbsp; That&#8217;s right.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One each?&nbsp; One interpreter each, on each side?<br>&nbsp;<br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: &nbsp;Each will have an interpreter, and President Putin will be accompanied by his foreign minister.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the Russians are saying four to five hours of talks.&nbsp; Is that what you&#8217;re expecting?&nbsp; Or what?<br>&nbsp;<br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Yeah, in that neighborhood.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Inaudible) press conference is eight o&#8217;clock, thereabout, for our planning purposes?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; I think we&#8217;re going to see how the flow goes.&nbsp; This is diplomacy in action, David.&nbsp; Get on the ride.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Four or five hours straight?&nbsp; No break in between?&nbsp; Are they going to share any meals or anything like that?<br>&nbsp;<br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; No meals.&nbsp; We anticipate there will be breaks.&nbsp; But as [senior administration official] said, we&#8217;ve agreed with the other side that there will be some flexibility just so that the leaders can make determinations about the best way to conduct their business.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q &nbsp;Sorry, just to reiterate: No meal? &nbsp;They won&#8217;t sit &#8212; they won’t have not even tea? &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Well &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>(Laughter.)<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Definitely not tea.<br>&nbsp;<br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; I presume &#8212; I presume that the principals and the participants can ask for some water or coffee or tea.&nbsp; I mean, it’s not &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No sort of formal &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Nothing formal.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Inaudible) break bread<br>&nbsp;<br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; No breaking of bread.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the position on the ambassadors?&nbsp; Do you expect to reach some sort of deal to send ambassadors back to the country?<br>&nbsp;<br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; I&#8217;m not going to get ahead of tomorrow, but both ambassadors will be in Geneva.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, you want to start &#8212; you want to give us an idea of what to expect?<br>&nbsp;<br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; I&#8217;ll start with the baseline of what the President said last night.&nbsp; You guys got to hear from him repeatedly, as there were multiple questions posed about the meeting tomorrow.&nbsp; And happy to answer any questions that you might have.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are you expecting any specific agreements to emerge from this summit?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; I think we expect that there will be areas where the presidents will task out further work to their teams.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s about all I can say today.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Backwards slightly, could tell us a bit more about the discussions the President had with the NATO leaders about tomorrow’s summit?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; So, the President, as he said yesterday, led off the discussion.&nbsp; He was the first leader to speak after the Secretary General.&nbsp; He gave about 10 minutes of remarks, which covered a number of different issues, but Russia was a critical point of emphasis in his comments.&nbsp; And he explained to the leaders what he intended to say.&nbsp; He did so privately, behind closed doors, so I&#8217;m not going to get into the details of it.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And he asked them to share whatever thoughts or advice they had about the meeting.&nbsp; And several leaders did respond with commentary.&nbsp; And as he said last night, those who spoke to the meeting were positive about the fact that he was doing it and positive about the fact that he was consulting with them in advance.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>He also pledged to them that on an ongoing basis &#8212; to the extent, for example, we&#8217;re working with Russia on arms control-related issues &#8212; he would coordinate closely with NATO so that they had a chance to have input into the arms control agenda.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was there any specific mention of Russian S400 in the Turkey bilat with President Erdoğan?&nbsp; And will that issue be brought up in the meeting with President Putin?<br>&nbsp;<br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; There was a mention of the Russian S400 system.&nbsp; That&#8217;s an issue between us and Turkey to do with our domestic law.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t anticipate it will be covered in the summit.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was there an agreement with President Erdoğan on the Russian S400 in exchange for Turkish presence at the Kabul airport?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; No, there was no linkage between the S400 and the Kabul airport.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Back to the Russians: The Russians were saying that one sort of quick for- step could be returning the ambassadors.&nbsp; Is that on the table?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; It is a possibility.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not going to confirm that until the two presidents have had the chance to meet.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the longer term, let me ask about the two big areas you&#8217;ve identified already that will be big subjects: strategic stability and cyber.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>On strategic stability, is your concept here to work out from now to something that would be doable after New START expires?&nbsp; So, in other words, have something that rolls together, maybe with the Chinese and others?&nbsp; Or do you have more short-term goals?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And on cyber, I assume you have very short-term goals on ransomware &#8212; not allowing people to operate from their territory.&nbsp; But tell us about &#8212; to the degree you can &#8212; your longer-term goals on state-sponsored activities, since there&#8217;s been so much of that out of Russia.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; So, on the first: We are flexible on the timing and format of agreements.&nbsp; It could be more comprehensive; it could be agreements that cover different pieces at different points in time.&nbsp; So, this is not necessarily a circumstance of waiting until New START is expired to do something.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>But it is certainly the case &#8212; and I think this is implied in your question &#8212; that we do have a 2026 final expiration of New START.&nbsp; And a big part of the question that the two presidents are trying to answer through these talks is what comes after &#8212; what will come after New START.&nbsp; So &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Inaudible) China and other players as well?<br>&nbsp;<br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; I think, ultimately, we are going to need to have a sustained conversation with China on arms control-related issues.&nbsp; But the President has made clear that, at the outset, a bilateral discussion between the two biggest nuclear powers in the world is the way to start.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And on the cyber side?<br>&nbsp;<br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Oh, on the cyber side, obviously, ransomware will be a significant topic of conversation tomorrow.&nbsp; They will also discuss the broader issue of cyber norms, cyber rules of the road tomorrow in the discussion.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And the President will make clear that if we see significant types of cyber activity, like we did with SolarWinds, he will respond like we did with SolarWinds.&nbsp; Beyond that, I&#8217;m not going to preview the conversation per the President&#8217;s desire to be able to have the discussion with Putin and then read it out after.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you think that was a sufficient response on SolarWinds?<br>&nbsp;<br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; We believe that the response on SolarWinds was, as the President said at the time, proportional.&nbsp; We believe it sent a message about what the United States would and would not tolerate.&nbsp; And so, we judge<br>that the response we took was the right one.&nbsp; But, of course, this is a larger challenge that is going to require a consistent, steady policy on our part, and we will<br>approach the issue accordingly.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What&#8217;s he going to say to Putin about the case of Aleksey Navalny?<br>&nbsp;<br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; I&#8217;ll put it this way:<br>When the other side tries to say that there are issues that are off the table or that won&#8217;t be on the agenda, for the American President, nothing is off the table.&nbsp; Certainly human rights are not off the table, and individual high-profile cases are not off the table.&nbsp; But otherwise, I&#8217;m not going to preview what he&#8217;s going to say.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What will he say about Belarus and the recent incident with Ryanair?&nbsp; Is that going to be coming up as well?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Well, he&#8217;s already said publicly that he viewed that as an act of egregious air piracy and completely inconsistent with international norms and the rule of law.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t think you will hear anything inconsistent when he reads the meeting out.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>But again, I don&#8217;t want to be in the position of saying what he&#8217;s going to say to Putin.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you have an objective, like a particular deliverable that you&#8217;re seeking?&nbsp; Or is that the wrong framing, because it&#8217;s not about deliverables for you right now?<br>&nbsp;<br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; During &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Inaudible.)<br>&nbsp;<br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; So we&#8217;re not &#8212; we&#8217;re not expecting a big set of deliverables out of this meeting.&nbsp; We are seeking three basic things:<br>&nbsp;<br>First, a clear set of taskings about areas where working together can advance our national interest and make the world safer.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Second, a clear laydown of the areas of America&#8217;s vital national interests, where Russian activities that run counter to those interests will be met with a response.<br>&nbsp;<br>And third, a clear explication of the President&#8217;s vision for American values and our national priorities.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Those are the three things that we&#8217;re trying to accomplish, and the President will do that over the course of the meeting with President Putin.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And can you just tell us a little bit about how has the President prepped for this?&nbsp; What &#8212; you know, had he been meeting with advisors?&nbsp; What has he been doing for this?<br>&nbsp;<br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; He&#8217;s been preparing for this like he prepares for every significant international engagement.&nbsp; He reviews the issues &#8212; written material; he cares about digging into the details.&nbsp; That very much matters to him.&nbsp; And he&#8217;s also had the opportunity to engage with a wide variety of advisors across the government who have deep expertise on Russia, as well as to hear from some outside experts as well.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you just speak a little bit more about the Baltic countries meeting?&nbsp; Why did the President feel like it was necessary to meet with them first before meeting with President Putin, on top of the NATO and EU allies?<br>&nbsp;<br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Beyond being necessary, the President really loves those kinds of meetings.&nbsp; I went with him to Lithuania some years ago, and he&#8217;s just energized by the model and example of these vibrant democracies on the eastern flank.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>But specifically, relative to the meeting tomorrow, he wanted to show quite publicly that he was going to stand in solidarity with NATO&#8217;s eastern flank allies, that he was going to consult with them in advance of the meeting, and that he was going to stand up for their interests in the meeting.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did they have any advice for him on dealing with Putin, since they live in his neighborhood?<br>&nbsp;<br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; They sure did.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What did they say?<br>&nbsp;<br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; But I’ll leave that to them.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, come on.&nbsp; (Laughs.)<br>&nbsp;<br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; But, yes, they had good advice.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In all his long travels and associations with this part of the world, has he learned any Russian?&nbsp; I mean, literally, like a few words.&nbsp; Or does he speak a spattering of it?&nbsp; Or &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; Will he say “hello” in Russian, for example, or a “thank you” or anything?<br>&nbsp;<br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does he have conversation (inaudible)?<br>&nbsp;<br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know if he will say “hello.”&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Inaudible.)<br>&nbsp;<br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; I don’t &#8212; I actually &#8212; I have not heard him speak Russian, but I can&#8217;t confirm one way or the other.<br>&nbsp;<br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; All right.&nbsp; Thank you, guys.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>4:12 P.M. CEST</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Europa Building, European Council<br>Brussels, Belgium</p>



<p>1:13 P.M. CEST<br>&nbsp;<br>PRESIDENT BIDEN:&nbsp; Well, thank you.&nbsp; Thank you both very much.&nbsp; It’s been one of the great pleasures getting to know you both personally and (inaudible) our official positions.&nbsp; And we were at the G7, and again today &#8212; I apologize I kept my colleagues in the closed meeting.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>But I want to &#8212; you know, this is – I haven’t been back to Brussels or the EU since 2017, and since the &#8212; back then, also the first summit back in 2014.<br>&nbsp;<br>But I brought the A-team with me today.&nbsp; And, you know, I’ve said, both publicly and privately, that America is back, and this is why we’re here in full force.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>I’m happy to have with me today the members of my Cabinet: Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken; he suffers from the problem of having worked with me for years.&nbsp; And also Trade Representative, Ambassador Katherine Tai, who has made some real progress already.&nbsp; And Secretary of Commerce, Gina Raimondo, who was a first-rate governor and one of the brightest people that we’ve worked with, and agreed to come on as our Secretary of Commerce.<br>&nbsp;<br>And one of the things that you and I were talking about – and will come as no shock to either of you: Europe is our natural partner, and the reason is we’re committed to the same democratic norms and institutions, and are &#8212; they are increasingly under attack.<br>&nbsp;<br>And we &#8212; I’ve said it before, and I apologize for repeating &#8212; oh, I didn’t mention Jake Sullivan (inaudible) National Security Advisor.&nbsp; I’m leaving out a lot of people here.&nbsp; I apologize.&nbsp; I’m going to get in trouble.&nbsp; But anyway, we’ll get back to that in a minute.<br>&nbsp;<br>But we &#8212; you know, there’s a lot that is happening.&nbsp; I used to always &#8212; my friends would kid me while in the United States Senate, because I served there, for always quoting Irish poets.&nbsp; You think I quoted Irish poets because I’m Irish.&nbsp; That’s not the reason.&nbsp; I quote them because they’re the best poets in the world &#8212; that’s why.&nbsp; (Laughter.)<br>&nbsp;<br>But all kidding aside, there is a &#8212; there is a stanza from a poem from an Irish poet, who (inaudible).&nbsp; He said, “All is changed, changed utterly: A terrible beauty has been born.”&nbsp; I think all has changed in the last 10, 12 years, and it’s not because of any one person.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>I think we’re in the midst of terrible beauty having been born &#8212; a great shift in technology, a great shift in the development of the world, and it’s causing great anxiety in each our countries and uncertainty among many of our colleagues of what’s going to be their place in the world.&nbsp; Are they going to be replaced by a new technology?&nbsp; Are they going to no longer have a job?&nbsp; And what are they going to do?<br>&nbsp;<br>And that comes along at the same time that that also generates &#8212; when an uncertainty is generated politically like that, by individuals, it also generates some folks who are less than &#8212; how can I say it? &#8212; some of them are like charlatans, trying to take advantage of those concerns.&nbsp; And we see it in Europe.&nbsp; We see it in the United States.&nbsp; We’ve seen it around the world.&nbsp; And it’s phony populism.<br>&nbsp;<br>So it seems to me that the best answer to deal with these changes is that &#8212; to have a circumstance where our economies grow, and they grow together, and they grow still based on the value set that united us in the first place.&nbsp; And I think we do share just the same basic values of human dignity and human rights as my colleagues.<br>&nbsp;<br>I’ll be very colloquial with you: My dad had a transition where, in the city we lived in, coal was dying; it was no longer relevant.&nbsp; You know, he was not a &#8212; my great grandfather was a coal miner; he was a mining engineer.&nbsp; But in northeastern Pennsylvania, when coal died &#8212; my dad was a salesperson &#8212; and the economy collapsed.&nbsp; And we moved to another part where there were jobs, in southern &#8212; into &#8212; down in Delaware, a very &#8212; just across the Pennsylvania border.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And my family &#8212; my siblings and I would hear him often use the following expression: He said, “Joe, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck.&nbsp; It’s about your dignity.&nbsp; It’s about respect.&nbsp; It’s about your place in the community.&nbsp; It’s about being able to look at your child in the eye and say ‘Honey, it’s&nbsp;going to be okay’ and mean it.”&nbsp; I think we sometimes forget that.&nbsp; It’s about the dignity of the worker and them being able to hold their head high.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And so I think we have an enormous opportunity, if we think in terms of these changes &#8212; particularly in terms of global warming &#8212; if we think of them in terms of jobs.&nbsp; The kind of jobs that we’re going to have to create to preserve the environment are jobs that can pay well, that are going to be (inaudible) technologies that working-class, blue-collar workers, as we say in the States, will be able to make more money, be able to do well.&nbsp; And &#8212; but we have to, all of us, accommodate those changes and provide for them.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And so, I think we have a lot to deal with, from COVID-19 to whether or not we’re in a position that we can generate the kind of strengthening in transatlantic trade and technological cooperation.<br>&nbsp;<br>There are, sort of, a different set of priorities with the same objective: How do likeminded countries, sharing the same values, work together to improve the living standard for not only our people, but for the rest of the world?&nbsp; And I think we have the capacity to do that, and it’s going to take an awful lot of hard work and determination.<br>&nbsp;<br>And I’ll conclude by saying: One of the reasons I’m optimistic is because of our younger generation, in Europe as well as the United States.&nbsp; The young generation &#8212; this one &#8212; is the best educated in American history.&nbsp; It is also the least prejudiced, the most open, and the most &#8212; the most committed.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And I think that we have reason to believe that if we provide the policies that are consistent, that provide for the kind of growth and opportunity for them &#8212; and education plays a gigantic part of that &#8212; I think we &#8212; I think the future is very, very bright.&nbsp; I think we have an opportunity to do some, really, very good things.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And with that, I should &#8212; as my mother would say, I should “hush up” and let this discussion move forward.<br>&nbsp;<br>1:21 P.M. CEST</p>

<ul><li>A nationally-recognized leader on voting rights who would be the only Latina serving on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit</li><li>A former public defender and current civil rights plaintiff’s attorney who would be the second African American woman judge actively serving on the District Court for the District of Columbia</li><li>A federal prosecutor who would be the first judge of South Asian descent to serve on the District Court for the District of Connecticut</li><li>A Department of Justice lawyer with two decades of civil rights experience, including as Deputy Chief of the Appellate Section in the Civil Rights Division</li><li>A magistrate judge on the D.C.

<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong>Towards a Renewed Transatlantic Partnership</strong></p>



<ol type="1"><li>The United States and the European Union represent 780 million people who share democratic values and the largest economic relationship in the world. We have a chance and a responsibility to help people make a living and keep them safe and secure, fight climate change, and stand up for democracy and human rights. We laid the foundations of the world economy and the rules-based international order after World War II based on openness, fair competition, transparency, and accountability. Some of the rules need an update: to protect our health, our climate and planet, to ensure democracy delivers and technology improves our lives.</li><li>We, the leaders of the European Union and the United States, met today to renew our Transatlantic partnership, set a Joint Transatlantic Agenda for the post-pandemic era, and commit to regular dialogue to take stock of progress.</li><li>Together, we intend to: (i) end the COVID-19 pandemic, prepare for future global health challenges, and drive forward a sustainable global recovery; (ii) protect our planet and foster green growth; (iii) strengthen trade, investment, and technological cooperation; and (iv) build a more democratic, peaceful, and secure world. We are committed to uphold the rules-based international order with the United Nations at its core, reinvigorate and reform multilateral institutions where needed, and cooperate with all those who share these objectives.<br><br><strong>I. End the COVID-19 pandemic, prepare for future global health challenges, and drive forward a sustainable global recovery</strong></li><li>Ending the COVID-19 pandemic through global cooperation is our first priority. We promote equitable and affordable access and delivery of safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines, diagnostics, and therapeutics through the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator. We commit to continuing to support the COVAX Facility and encourage more donors to make 2 billion vaccine doses available worldwide by late 2021. We aspire to vaccinate at least two thirds of the world’s population by the end of 2022.</li><li>A Joint U.S.-EU COVID Manufacturing and Supply Chain Taskforce has been established to deepen cooperation and identify and resolve issues around expanding vaccine and therapeutics production capacity, including by building new production facilities, maintaining open and secure supply chains, avoiding any unnecessary export restrictions, and encouraging voluntary sharing of know-how and technology on mutually-determined terms including through the ACT-A. We are committed to strengthen global health security, pandemic preparedness, and response to health emergencies and future outbreaks. We plan to leverage our strengths to help countries build the capacities to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease threats.  We intend to work together with like-minded countries this year to explore options towards sustainable global health and health security financing, supported by strengthened global accountability, tracking and allocation of global health security financing, including the Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response (IPPPR) recommendation toward a Global Health Threats Council.</li><li>We resolve to reinforce cooperation to reform the World Health Organization (WHO), including advancing sustainable financing and improving its internal operations. We welcome the “Rome Declaration” principles endorsed at the G20 Global Health Summit and the outcomes of the World Health Assembly, including the establishment of a Working Group on Strengthening WHO Preparedness and Response to Health Emergencies that will prioritize the assessment of the benefits of developing a WHO convention, agreement, or other international instrument on pandemic preparedness and response and provide a report to be considered at the special session of the Health Assembly in November 2021. We will continue to engage in health research initiatives, including to develop medical countermeasures in a much shorter period of time, to support the regional surge capacity to produce them, and to facilitate trade in essential medical goods. We call for progress on a transparent, evidence-based, and expert-led WHO-convened phase 2 study on the origins of COVID-19, that is free from interference, and we commit to working together toward the development and use of a swift and independent means for investigating such outbreaks in the future.</li><li>We welcome G7 discussions to build back better for the world—orienting development finance tools toward the range of challenges faced by developing countries, including in resilient infrastructure and technologies, addressing the impact of climate change, health systems and security, developing digital solutions, and advancing gender equality and education. We intend to jointly drive forward a sustainable and inclusive global recovery, in line with the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development that leaves no one behind and prioritizes the most vulnerable and marginalized, protects our climate and planet, protects human rights, empowers women and girls and creates decent jobs. We will enhance our cooperation on sustainable connectivity and high-quality infrastructure. We intend to continue providing assistance to countries in need, address debt vulnerabilities, and stimulate domestic reforms and increased private investment.  To address the problem of unsustainable debts faced by many countries in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, we plan to promote the swift and transparent implementation of the G20 Common Framework for debt treatment and explore innovative instruments such as debt swaps. Recognizing the increase in food insecurity and malnutrition projected, including as a result of the pandemic, we commit to building resilient food systems.</li><li>We resolve to support efforts to ensure safe and secure global mobility. We will establish a joint U.S.-EU Experts’ Working Group to exchange information and expertise to reinitiate safe and sustainable travel between the EU and the United States. We welcome progress made by the United States and the EU toward additional EU member states meeting the requirements necessary for visa-free travel to the United States and intend to continue our dialogue towards visa waiver travel.<br><br><strong>II.</strong> <strong>Protect our planet and foster green growth</strong></li><li>Climate change, environmental degradation, and the loss of biodiversity are mutually-reinforcing, extraordinary threats to humanity. We plan to continue and strengthen our cooperation to tackle climate change, environmental degradation and the loss of biodiversity, promote green growth, protect our oceans, and urge ambitious action by all other major players.</li><li>We are committed to the Paris Agreement and its effective and strengthened implementation. To provide an effective platform for cooperation in this regard, we commit to establish a U.S.-EU High-Level Climate Action Group. We intend to lead by example through becoming net zero greenhouse gases (GHG) economies no later than 2050 and implementing our respective enhanced 2030 targets / Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). We resolve to engage our international partners to achieve an ambitious outcome at the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26), making every effort to keep a 1.5 degree Celsius limit on global temperature within reach. We intend to closely coordinate to promote robust climate measures, address the risk of carbon leakage, and cooperate on sustainable finance, including by providing the private sector with usable tools and metrics. </li><li>We are determined to accelerate a climate-neutral future and ensure a just transition that leaves no one behind, including through low greenhouse gas emission technologies, an increasing uptake of renewable energies, a stronger engagement to promote clean energy innovation in Mission Innovation, increased energy efficiency and methane emissions reduction, sustainable food systems, including climate-smart agricultural systems, and sustainable and smart mobility. We commit to rapidly scaling up technologies and policies that further accelerate the transition away from unabated coal capacity and to an overwhelmingly decarbonized power system in the 2030s, consistent with our respective 2030 NDCs and 2050 net zero commitments. The U.S.-EU Energy Council will continue to lead coordination on strategic energy issues, including decarbonization of the energy sector, energy security, and sustainable energy supply chains. We resolve to increase our cooperation on transition towards a climate-neutral, resource-efficient and circular economy.  In this context, we intend to work towards a Transatlantic Green Technology Alliance that would foster cooperation on the development and deployment of green technologies, as well as promote markets to scale such technologies.   </li><li>We intend to continue to scale up efforts to meet the USD 100 billion per year climate finance goal through to 2025, in the context of meaningful mitigation actions and transparency on implementation from public and private sources, as well as to continue to scale up finance contributing to climate adaptation action.  In order to fulfill the objectives of the Paris Agreement, we stress that international investments in unabated coal must stop now and call for global efforts to phase out unabated coal in energy production. We resolve to take concrete steps towards an absolute end to new direct government support for unabated international thermal coal power generation in third countries by the end of 2021, including through Official Development Assistance, export finance, investment, and financial and trade promotion support. We commit to reviewing our official trade, export, and development finance policies towards these objectives.</li><li>We are strongly determined to halt and reverse biodiversity loss by 2030 and take urgent action to address its drivers. In this context, we are committed to the goal of conserving or protecting at least 30 percent of the global land and 30 percent of the global oceans by 2030. We commit to contribute to this goal by conserving or protecting at least 30 percent of our own land, including terrestrial and inland waters, and coastal and marine areas by 2030 according to national circumstances and approaches. We plan to actively restore nature for the benefit of the health and well-being of our citizens, and step up our cooperation on deforestation and wildlife trafficking. We encourage others to make similar commitments to support efforts that benefit both climate and biodiversity, and protect our oceans. We plan to jointly promote a successful and ambitious post-2020 global biodiversity framework at the 15<sup>th</sup> UN Biodiversity Conference of the Parties (COP15). We also encourage partners to join multilateral efforts at the UN Environment Assembly to consider next steps at the global level to tackle plastics pollution.</li><li>We commit to working together to protect our oceans, including by combatting marine litter. We resolve to support the designation of new marine protected areas in the Southern Ocean, and continue cooperating for the purpose of the sustainable blue economy, sustainable fishing, prevention of Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) Fishing, and research through the All-Atlantic Ocean Research alliance. We will also plan to work together at the next UN Ocean Conference and at the intergovernmental conference on Marine Biodiversity beyond National Jurisdiction.<br><br><strong>III. Strengthen trade, investment, and technological cooperation</strong></li><li>We commit to grow the U.S.-EU trade and investment relationship as well as to uphold and reform the rules-based multilateral trading system. We intend to use trade to help fight climate change, protect the environment, promote workers’ rights, expand resilient and sustainable supply chains, continue to cooperate in emerging technologies, and create decent jobs. We resolve to stand together to protect our businesses and workers from unfair trade practices, in particular those posed by non-market economies that are undermining the world trading system.</li><li>We resolve to drive digital transformation that spurs trade and investment, strengthens our technological and industrial leadership, boosts innovation, and protects and promotes critical and emerging technologies and infrastructure. We plan to cooperate on the development and deployment of new technologies based on our shared democratic values, including respect for human rights, and that encourages compatible standards and regulations.  </li><li>To kick-start this positive agenda and to provide an effective platform for cooperation, we establish a high-level U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council (TTC). The major goals of the TTC will be to grow the bilateral trade and investment relationship; to avoid new unnecessary technical barriers to trade; to coordinate, seek common ground, and strengthen global cooperation on technology, digital issues, and supply chains; to support collaborative research and exchanges; to cooperate on compatible and international standards development; to facilitate regulatory policy and enforcement cooperation and, where possible, convergence; to promote innovation and leadership by U.S. and European firms; and to strengthen other areas of cooperation. The cooperation and exchanges of the TTC will be without prejudice to the regulatory autonomy of the United States and the European Union and will respect the different legal systems in both jurisdictions. Cooperation within the TTC will also feed into coordination in multilateral bodies and wider efforts with like-minded partners, with the aim of promoting a democratic model of digital governance.</li><li>The TTC will initially include working groups with agendas focused on technology standards cooperation (including on AI, Internet of Things, among other emerging technologies), climate and green tech, ICT security and competitiveness, data governance and technology platforms, the misuse of technology threatening security and human rights, export controls, investment screening, promoting SMEs access to, and use of, digital technologies, and global trade challenges. It will also include a working group on reviewing and strengthening our most critical supply chains. Notably, we commit to building a U.S.-EU partnership on the rebalancing of global supply chains in semiconductors with a view to enhancing U.S. and EU respective security of supply as well as capacity to design and produce the most powerful and resource efficient semiconductors.</li><li>In parallel with the TTC, we intend to establish a U.S.-EU Joint Technology Competition Policy Dialogue that would focus on approaches to competition policy and enforcement, and increased cooperation in the tech sector. To support collaborative research and innovation exchanges, we promote a staff exchange program between our research funding agencies, and we intend to explore the possibility of developing a new research initiative on biotechnology and genomics, with a view to setting common standards. A new implementing arrangement between the EU Joint Research Centre and the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technologies aims to expand cooperation to new areas. We also resolve to deepen cooperation on cybersecurity information sharing and situational awareness, as well as cybersecurity certification of products and software.</li><li>We commit to work together to ensure safe, secure, and trusted cross-border data flows that protect consumers and enhance privacy protections, while enabling Transatlantic commerce.  To this end, we plan to continue to work together to strengthen legal certainty in Transatlantic flows of personal data. We also commit to continue cooperation on consumer protection and access to electronic evidence in criminal matters.</li><li>We salute having reached an Understanding on a Cooperative Framework for Large Civil Aircraft, reflecting a new transatlantic relationship in this area.  We are committed to make this framework work to promote a level playing field, overcome long-standing differences, avoid future litigation, and more effectively address the challenge posed by non-market economies. We will engage in discussions to allow the resolution of existing differences on measures regarding steel and aluminum before the end of the year.  In this regard, we are determined to work together to resolve tensions arising from the U.S. application of tariffs on imports from the EU under U.S. Section 232, and will work towards allowing trade to recover from its 2020 lows and ending the WTO disputes. We commit to ensure the long-term viability of our steel and aluminum industries, and to address excess capacity.  We are determined to foster a fair, sustainable, and modern international tax system and cooperate to reach a global consensus on the question of taxation of multinational companies through the G20/OECD Inclusive Framework and look forward to reaching an agreement at the July meeting of G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors.  </li><li>We intend to work cooperatively on efforts to achieve meaningful World Trade Organization (WTO) reform and help promote outcomes that benefit our workers and companies. We commit to work together to advance the proper functioning of the WTO’s negotiating function and dispute settlement system, which requires addressing long-standing issues. Plurilateral mechanisms can provide a means for addressing new trade concerns when multilateral solutions are not possible. We plan to continue to cooperate on special and differential treatment, and on our joint transparency proposal. We intend to seek to update the WTO rulebook with more effective disciplines on industrial subsidies, unfair behavior of state-owned enterprises, and other trade and market distorting practices. We intend to work closely together, and with the wider support of the Membership of the WTO, to conclude a meaningful agreement on fisheries subsidies, and to a trade policy response to the COVID-19 pandemic that facilitates expansion of production and equitable access to vaccines, and to work towards a WTO Ministerial later this year that contributes to a more effective and modernized rules-based trading system.</li><li>We commit to strengthen our cooperation on space by building on the Galileo – GPS Agreement. This could include making progress on access to Galileo’s Public Regulated Service signal, engaging on space-based Earth observation to support climate policies, for instance by monitoring CO2 levels and emergency services, as well as exchanging on our respective approaches on space traffic management.<br><br><strong>IV. Build a more democratic, peaceful and secure world</strong></li><li>Together, the European Union and the United States are an anchor for democracy, peace, and security around the world, to peacefully prevent and resolve conflicts, uphold the rule of law and international law, and promote human rights for all, gender equity and equality, and the empowerment of women and girls, including by working together through multilateral institutions including the UN Human Rights Council. Together, we resolve to address humanitarian needs and stand up for international humanitarian law as well as expand the resource base for humanitarian action<strong>.</strong> We reject authoritarianism in all its forms around the globe, resisting autocrats’ efforts to create an environment that protects their rule and serves their interests, while undermining liberal democracies. We intend to enhance cooperation on the use of sanctions to pursue shared foreign policy and security objectives, while avoiding possible unintended consequences for European and U.S. interests. In this respect, we resolve to continue to engage on issues on which we might have different approaches.</li><li>We intend to support democracy across the globe by defending media freedom; advancing a free and open internet; fostering responsible behavior in cyberspace; upholding transparency and combatting corruption in financial systems, politics, and the economy; tackling disinformation; protecting civil society and civic space; advancing women’s political participation and empowerment; and protecting the human rights of all people. We resolve to lead by example at home. We intend to partner in the Summit for Democracy, committing to concrete actions to defend universal human rights, prevent democratic backsliding, and fight corruption. We plan to increase cooperation and exchange information and expertise to increase resilience against and to counter foreign information manipulation and interference, all forms of coercion including economic pressure, hybrid threats, malicious cyber activities, terrorism and violent extremism, and other common security threats. We resolve to support the ability of civil society and independent media to operate freely, and to protect and defend journalists in order to hold governments accountable.</li><li>We intend to closely consult and cooperate on the full range of issues in the framework of our respective similar multi-faceted approaches to China, which include elements of cooperation, competition, and systemic rivalry. We intend to continue coordinating on our shared concerns, including ongoing human rights violations in Xinjiang and Tibet; the erosion of autonomy and democratic processes in Hong Kong; economic coercion; disinformation campaigns; and regional security issues. We remain seriously concerned about the situation in the East and South China Seas and strongly oppose any unilateral attempts to change the status quo and increase tensions. We reaffirm the critical importance of respecting international law, in particular the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) noting its provisions setting forth the lawful maritime entitlements of States, on maritime delimitation, on the sovereign rights and jurisdictions of States, on the obligation to settle disputes by peaceful means, and on the freedom of navigation and overflight and other internationally lawful uses of the sea. We underscore the importance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, and encourage the peaceful resolution of cross-Strait issues. We intend also to coordinate on our constructive engagement with China on issues such as climate change and non-proliferation, and on certain regional issues.</li><li>We stand united in our principled approach towards Russia and we are ready to respond decisively to its repeating pattern of negative behavior and harmful activities, which Russia must address to prevent the further deterioration of relations including on the list of so-called unfriendly states.To coordinate our policies and actions, we plan to establish a U.S.-EU high-level dialogue on Russia. We condemn Russia’s continued actions to undermine Ukraine’s and Georgia&#8217;s sovereignty, territorial integrity, and independence. We call on Russia to ensure foreign diplomatic missions in Russia can operate in a safe, secure, and productive fashion. We urge Russia to stop its continuous crackdown on civil society, the opposition, and independent media, and release all political prisoners. At the same time, we keep channels of communication open and possibilities for selective cooperation in areas of common interest. We also commit to work together to address the urgent and escalating threat from criminal ransomware networks that pose risks to our citizens and companies.</li><li>We are determined to continue to stand in support of the sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity of the EU’s Eastern partners and will support the reform path of Ukraine, Georgia, and the Republic of Moldova. We resolve to work towards long-term peace, resilience, and stability in the South Caucasus. We stand with the people of Belarus and their demands for human rights and democracy. We resolve to hold the Lukashenka regime to account for its escalating attacks on human rights and fundamental freedoms and for endangering aviation safety through the unprecedented and unacceptable forced diversion of an EU passenger airplane under false pretenses, and the subsequent arrest of a journalist as part of a continuing assault on opposition voices and the freedom of the press.    </li><li>We intend to further strengthen our joint engagement in the Western Balkans, including through the EU-facilitated dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina on normalization of their relations, and by supporting key reforms for EU integration. We resolve to work hand-in-hand for sustainable de-escalation in the Eastern Mediterranean, where differences should be settled through dialogue in good faith and in accordance with international law. We aim for a cooperative and mutually beneficial relationship with a democratic Turkey. We plan to join efforts for a stable and secure Middle East and North Africa. The European Union and the United States welcome the ceasefire in the conflict in the Middle East and reaffirm the need for Israelis and Palestinians to enjoy equal measures of freedom, security, prosperity, and democracy on the basis of a two-State solution. In light of the growing humanitarian needs across Syria and the COVID 19 pandemic, we call on the UN Security Council to ensure that humanitarian aid can reach all people in need in Syria, including through cross border and cross line operations. We also regret the recent illegitimate elections in Syria and call on the international community to hold the Assad regime accountable for its brutal crimes and to work together to advance a political resolution to the conflict in line with UNSC resolution 2254. We reaffirm our commitment to support Libya in its path towards peace, security, and stability, and to work with parties in Yemen to agree to the UN’s proposal for an immediate ceasefire.</li><li>We are committed to peace and sustainable development in Africa. The political, human rights, security, and humanitarian situation in Ethiopia, Somalia, and the Sahel countries is of grave concern. We share deep concerns about the growing political and ethnic polarization throughout Ethiopia that threatens the country’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. We condemn ongoing atrocities, including widespread sexual violence, and we welcome the ongoing OHCHR investigations and call for full accountability for reported human rights violations in Tigray and for the perpetrators to be brought to justice. We also call for the withdrawal of foreign forces, and unimpeded humanitarian access. Following the Summit on financing African economies, we plan to act together with our African partners to ensure equitable access to safe and effective vaccines, and to provide financial support towards a sustainable recovery. We are determined to significantly amplify, on a voluntary basis, the impact of the proposed general allocation of Special Drawing Rights by the IMF for Africa.</li><li>We intend to work together with our partners for a free and open Indo-Pacific, which is inclusive, based on the rule of law and democratic values, and will contribute to the security and sustainable development of the region. We intend to work together to promote a swift return to democracy in Burma. In view of the withdrawal of international troops from Afghanistan, we intend to work closely to support the ongoing peace process and sustain regional stability and protect human rights gains, in particular for women and girls.</li><li>We further commit to strengthen our cooperation with the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean to support socio-economic recovery, address economic vulnerability, and push for stronger democratic governance, including supporting a negotiated outcome that leads to free and fair elections in Venezuela.</li><li>We resolve to work together to retain the Arctic as a region of peace and stability and collaborate, in particular through the Arctic Council, to ensure a clean habitat and constructive cooperation on climate change, environmental protection, and sustainable economic development benefiting the region’s inhabitants.</li><li>We resolve to work together to counter the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and renew global arms control efforts. We emphasize our support for the ongoing diplomatic efforts and negotiations in Vienna aimed at facilitating the return of the United States to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) as well as the full and effective implementation of the deal by Iran and the United States. We share serious concerns about steps taken by Iran, which are inconsistent with the JCPOA. The European Union and the United States recognize that, alongside the return to full and effective implementation by Iran of its nuclear related commitments, the lifting of sanctions constitutes an essential part of the JCPOA. The JCPOA remains critical to ensuring the exclusively peaceful nature of Iran’s nuclear program and to upholding the global nuclear non-proliferation architecture.</li><li>We resolve to revive dialogue on migration and mobility, including innovative solutions on effective and safe migration policy in cooperation with third countries, including via the U.S.-EU Platform on Migration and Asylum.</li><li>We welcome the EU’s invitation to the United States to join the PESCO project Military Mobility as an important step towards closer U.S.-EU partnership in security and defense.  We recognize the contribution EU security and defense initiatives can make to both European and Transatlantic security and plan to launch a dedicated dialogue on security and defense and pursue closer cooperation in this field.  We commit to work towards an Administrative Arrangement for the United States with the European Defence Agency, with discussions, including on modalities and conditions for a closer and mutually beneficial cooperation in this framework, beginning as soon as possible.  We reaffirm our unwavering support for robust NATO-EU cooperation and to the commitments outlined and principles enshrined in the 2016 and 2018 Joint Declarations.  We will work jointly to raise the level of NATO-EU ambition in order to further strengthen this mutually reinforcing key strategic partnership. </li></ol>
