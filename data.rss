<p class="has-text-align-center">Stakeout Location</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; We had a really good meeting.&nbsp; And to answer your direct question, we have a deal.&nbsp; And I think it&#8217;s really important &#8212; we&#8217;ve all agreed &#8212; that none of us got what we &#8212; all that we wanted.&nbsp; I clearly didn&#8217;t get all I wanted.&nbsp; They gave more than, I think, maybe they were inclined to give in the first place.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>But this reminds me of the days we used to get an awful lot done up at the United States Congress.&nbsp; We actually worked with one &#8212; we had bipartisan deals.&nbsp; Bipartisan deals means compromise.<br>&nbsp;<br>One of the things that I&#8217;ve &#8212; I&#8217;ve made clear: I&#8217;ve signed on &#8212; and I&#8217;m going to let them give you the detail because &#8212; and you can ask them &#8212; and I&#8217;m &#8212; I will &#8212; I will talk to you all later, in the next hour or two.&nbsp; What- &#8212; I promise you I&#8217;m not going away.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>But one of the things that we agreed on: infrastructure.&nbsp; We made serious compromises on both ends.&nbsp; There is &#8212; and they&#8217;ll &#8212; they&#8217;ll give you the numbers.&nbsp; But we did not &#8212; they did not &#8212; and I understand their position &#8212; Republicans and this group did not want to go along with my &#8212; any of my Family Plan issues &#8212; the childcare tax credits, the human infrastructure that I talk about.<br>&nbsp;<br>And that &#8212; we&#8217;ll see what happens in the reconciliation bill and the budget process &#8212; if that &#8212; if we get some compromise there.&nbsp; And if we can&#8217;t, see if I can attract all the Democrats to a position that is there.&nbsp; But we&#8217;re going to &#8212; they&#8217;re going to move on a dual track.&nbsp; And &#8212; and that&#8217;s all I&#8217;ll say.<br>&nbsp;<br>But I want to thank each and every one of them.&nbsp; It&#8217;s been &#8212; you know, a lot of us go back a long way, where we&#8217;re used to doing one thing: Give each other our word and that&#8217;s the end.&nbsp; Nobody questions it.&nbsp; They have my word, I&#8217;ll stick with what they proposed, and they&#8217;ve given me their word as well. So, where I come from, that&#8217;s good enough for me.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So, I&#8217;m going to turn it over to the two Chairs here.&nbsp; And I&#8217;ll talk to you all a little bit later.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have you been briefed about the building collapse in Miami?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; I have.&nbsp; I spoke with the mayor.&nbsp; I spoke with the congresswoman.&nbsp; And I&#8217;ll have more to say about that as well.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are you committed to the two-track system, Mr. President?<br>&nbsp;<br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Pardon me?<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are you committed to the two-track system?<br>&nbsp;<br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; That is &#8212; there is going to be a two-track system.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And are you confident that you&#8217;re going to have all of the Democrats support it in the Senate?<br>&nbsp;<br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Let them talk to you. Okay?&nbsp; I&#8217;m not confident in anything except I trust their word.<br>&nbsp;<br>END</p>

<p>I extend my deepest condolences to the people of the Philippines on the death of former President Benigno “Noynoy” Aquino III. He was a valued friend and partner to the United States, and he will long be remembered for serving his country with integrity and selfless dedication. President Aquino’s steadfast commitment to advancing peace, upholding the rule of law, and driving economic growth for all Filipinos, while taking bold steps to promote the rules-based international order, leaves a remarkable legacy at home and abroad that will endure for years to come. I greatly valued our time working together, and I extend my heartfelt sympathies to his family and to all who will mourn his absence.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Aboard Air Force One<br>En Route Raleigh, NC</p>



<p>3:29 P.M. EDT<br> <br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Today, President Biden is traveling to Raleigh, North Carolina, where he will visit a mobile vaccination bus and highlight the ease of getting vaccinated, encourage vaccinations, and mobilize grassroots vaccine education and outreach efforts.<br> <br>The President isn’t the only one out today getting the word out about local efforts to vaccinate more Americans today.  The Second Gentleman and Dr. Murthy are hosting a press call to highlight new ways the administration is encouraging young people to get vaccinated, including new efforts from the private sector targeting young people.<br> <br>The First Lady and Dr. Fauci are in Florida today visiting an innovative vaccine sites, including in a drive-through site and one at a hockey arena that are getting Floridians vaccinated. <br> <br>And the Vice President is meeting virtually with local community groups and members that are doing the grassroots work to encourage vaccinations across the country.<br> <br>In his remarks, the President will highlight some of the incredible work North Carolinians are doing to get their community members vaccinated, Governor Cooper’s commitment to center equity in his COVID response, and also his administration’s work to get North Carolinians vaccinated.<br> <br>The President will also remind Americans about the growing threat of the Delta variant and that the vaccines are effective against the variants. <br> <br>Okay.  Zeke, you want to &#8212; you want to kick us off?<br> <br>Q    Thanks, Karine.  First, just following up on the President’s remarks a few minutes ago: Could you clarify what the President said what &#8212; that the &#8212; the bipartisan package had to move “in tandem” with the Democrats-only package?  Is the President saying he will not, under any circumstances, sign this bipartisan agreement unless Democrat &#8212; the Democrats’ unilateral package also passes?<br> <br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Well, let me just first say that the American people wanted to see a compromise.  They wanted to see a government that works for the people.  And that is what we saw today.  That’s what the President did.  And compromising means giving in some places, but also finding common ground. <br> <br>Ultimately, this does not have a gas tax in it.  It doesn’t have an electric vehicle tax.  It does not raise taxes of Americans who make more than &#8212; who make less than $400,000.  And this is a big win. <br> <br>And so, the way that the President sees this is that &#8212; we have always said that the President, in April, had two plans: the American Jobs Plan and the American Family Plan.  And he has always been clear that he intends to pass both.<br> <br>The infrastructure bill contains the core of the American Jobs Plan and the reconciliation bill will be the vehicle to pass the American Families Plan.  So, his intention is to make sure that he &#8212; we move forward with both.<br> <br>Q    But the President said before that one was &#8212; that the &#8212; the Jobs Plan necessitated the Families Plan.  Is that the case: He needs the Families Plan in order to get &#8212; in order for him to sign that bipartisan agreement?<br> <br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  He&#8217;s saying that he wants to do both at the same time.  That&#8217;s what he wants to do.  He wants to make &#8212; <br> <br>Q    So it’s not a red line, though?<br> <br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I &#8212; I&#8217;m going to let his words stand.  And what he is saying &#8212; that he&#8217;s not going to give up on his legislative priorities.  That&#8217;s what he said in April.  That&#8217;s what he was saying today. <br> <br>He wants to make sure that infrastructure &#8212; this investment, this historic investment &#8212; this agreement that was made today is done.  Right?  And we should be, you know, celebrating that &#8212; the fact that we got this bipartisanship. <br> <br>But he also wants to make sure that his investment in people &#8212; the &#8220;human investment,&#8221; as he has called it &#8212; is also done.  Because we have to make investments that help &#8212; that help people down the &#8212; down the line, that does generational investments, and also economic investment.<br> <br>Q    Does he still favor &#8212;<br> <br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So that’s his focus.<br> <br>Q    Sorry to cut in.<br> <br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  No, no.  It’s okay. <br> <br>Q    Sorry about that.<br> <br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead.  Go ahead.<br> <br>Q    Does he still favor a corporate tax increase as part of reconciliation, now that it didn&#8217;t make the bipartisan package?<br> <br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Well, the one thing I will say is that &#8212; like I said, we’re not going to raise taxes on people who make less than $400,000; that this is &#8212; this is a win.  This &#8212; there&#8217;s no gas tax.  Right?  There&#8217;s no &#8212; any kind of like taxes in that &#8212; in that regard.  And so that&#8217;s a big win. <br> <br>And so, he wanted to make sure that we do not put the burden on the American people, that these plans pay for itself, and that&#8217;s going to be the focus.  And we’ll have more, and we’ll continue to share when we have more.<br> <br>Q    He talked about the Democratic Party being a divided, but a rational party.  Is President Biden having any conversations today with Senator Sanders or any of the other members who wanted more in this bill?  What&#8217;s his outreach right now to progressives?<br> <br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Well, I &#8212; I don&#8217;t have any meetings to preview or conversations to preview.  As you know, he&#8217;s headed &#8212; we&#8217;re all heading to North Carolina today to focus on the importance of getting vaccinated and making sure that we lift up the work that &#8212; that&#8217;s being done in North Carolina today. <br> <br>But he has a good relationship with Senator Sanders.  They have spoken multiple times over the last 150 days or so.  And he&#8217;ll continue to have those conversations. <br> <br>As we know, the President has been all hands &#8212; &#8220;all-hands-on-deck&#8221; on this.  Right?  He&#8217;s had multiple conversations with congressional members.  He&#8217;s had them over in the Oval Office.  His staff &#8212; his senior White House staff has &#8212; this week, has been back and forth to the Capitol, having those conversations. <br> <br>So, that&#8217;s not going to end.  This is the beginning of, I think, this bipartisan structure &#8212; infrastructure framework is a first step to get to what we need to be doing for the American public, which is making sure that we invest in them and in their future.<br> <br>Q    Sure.  And President Biden said he conceded or gave up a lot in this bill, but technically he&#8217;s still going for everything else in the reconciliation bills.  Did he really give up anything?<br> <br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Well, let me just say this: This historic bipartisan infrastructure framework will make life better for millions of Americans.  Right?  It will create a generation of good-paying jobs and economic growth; position the U.S. to win the 21st century, including combating the climate crisis.<br> <br>As we&#8217;ve talked about, the President is committed &#8212; again, and I&#8217;ve said this already &#8212; to the full legislation agenda, which is including the care economy, expanding childcare, additional investment in clean energy, and passing a budget resolution that enacts his legislation priorities. <br> <br>So that is his commitment.  And, as we know, when we compromise, you give up a little; you know, you give a little.<br> <br>Q    But he didn&#8217;t give up anything.  I mean, he&#8217;s going to get everything through &#8212; he wants through reconciliation. <br> <br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  But, I mean, he said it himself: There were some things that, you know, he did give up on.  But, I think the bottom line is that, that red line that you were talking about &#8212; like that &#8212; that was the red line that was not crossed.  Right?  We didn&#8217;t &#8212; we&#8217;re not rising &#8212; raising taxes for people who make $400,000 &#8212; less than $400,000.  And there are no gas tax &#8212; tax on this. <br> <br>So this is a big win.  We have a bipartisanship deal.  This is something that the President, in many ways, was elected to do, because people &#8212; the American people really believed that he was able to do this, and he did.  And so we&#8217;re going to move forward on that.<br> <br>Q    Karine, about the vaccination rates and at the event today &#8212; so, given that we&#8217;re seeing the vaccination rates in the South and the West go down, but there&#8217;s some COVID cases rising in some of these states, is the White House worried that some of these July 4th celebrations might lead to, like, regional surges in the coronavirus &#8212; may become a super-spreader event? <br> <br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  (Inaudible) every part of the country, we have seen a dramatic drop in cases.  We&#8217;ve seen a drop &#8212; dramatic drop in deaths and hospitaliz- &#8212; hospitalizations since we took office. <br> <br>For vaccinated people, as we all know, it&#8217;s safe to see friends and family with no masks, go to a concert.  You see people going out to restaurants, weddings even, vacations, or have a Fourth of July party, which is right around the corner. <br> <br>But we do see varying vaccination rates across the country.  We will continue to build trust with local messengers. <br> <br>These local leaders the President will be highlighting today are mission critical to the next phase of our work.  Like, we know when the President &#8212; as you all know, when the President travels somewhere, that local news that they get in that local community is tremendous and is incredi- &#8212; and is incredibly important. <br> <br>So we&#8217;ll continue our vaccinations program as well.  So there&#8217;s a shot &#8212; a shot waiting for people when they&#8217;re ready.  It&#8217;s never been easier to get vaccinated.  It&#8217;s free.  Right?  It&#8217;s easy to get.  We have worked really hard.  The President has worked really hard to make that happen. <br> <br>And to reiterate, we are doing everything we can to help states get more Americans vaccinated.  That&#8217;s why the President is in North Carolina today. <br> <br>Ultimately, though, this is an individual decision.  This is a personal decision.  We&#8217;ve been clear, and so is the science.  The science is very clear.  As we know, the Delta variant is contagious and more severe, but the vaccines protects against it.  So we encourage &#8212; every day we can, we start &#8212; we encourage the American people to get vaccinated.<br> <br>Q    Following up on that, at what point do you concede that the people who want to get vaccinated have been vaccinated, the people who don&#8217;t want to get vaccinated aren&#8217;t going to get vaccinated?  And then what does that next step look like?<br> <br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I don&#8217;t think we concede that.  I think we have to make sure, in order to &#8212; for us to get back to normal, which we&#8217;re starting to do, we have to make sure that people are getting vaccinated.  We have to make sure that we&#8217;re working with people on the ground who are those trusted ver- &#8212; voices.  And they&#8217;re talking to their neighbors and getting their neighbors vaccinated if they haven&#8217;t been yet.  That&#8217;s the only way that we&#8217;re going to be able to also fight these variants that we&#8217;re seeing. <br> <br>So it is in &#8212; it is mission critical to make sure that we do all that we can to get people vaccinated.  That&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve been doing as an administration these last 150 days.<br> <br>Q    Karine, has the President or anyone in the White House watched General Milley&#8217;s comments yesterday on critical race theory or Secretary Austin&#8217;s comments?  And what&#8217;s the administration&#8217;s view in general on what the Republicans are saying about the teaching of critical race theory?<br> <br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, let me tell you where we stand.  We &#8212; we should teach our kids the truth: America is a great country, but there have been some dark chapters in our history. <br> <br>As the President said in Tulsa, &#8220;We should know the good, the bad, everything.  That&#8217;s what a great &#8212; that&#8217;s what great nations do: They come to terms with their dark sides.&#8221;  Slavery is a part of this nation&#8217;s history, so was the brave work of Black and white Americans and putting an end to it. <br> <br>Our children should learn all of our history.  We don&#8217;t think politicians trying to score political points by banning parts of our history in our classroom is a good thing.  So we trust our teachers to teach our kids the facts and the truth. <br> <br>Q    Karine, just quickly, to follow up on Jeff&#8217;s in question.  We&#8217;ve already seen some Democrats criticize the framework that the White House and these senators came up with.  Did the White House brief other Democrats on this framework before they came out and said they agreed to it?  And what do next steps look like to make sure that the entire party is unified on the path forward that the President has laid out?<br> <br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Look, like the President said outright: Today&#8217;s agreement is a crucial step forward in realizing the economic agenda for the American Jobs Plan and the fruition of hard work with both parties. <br> <br>This is, you know, the largest &#8212; he said this &#8212; the largest investment in public transportation in history.  It will connect every American to broadband, eliminate lead pipes to stop kids from drinking poisoned water, and makes critical progress on the climate crisis &#8212; including by making the largest investment in EV infrastructure in history, investment in clean power infrastructure, clean transportation infrastructure, and climate resilience. <br> <br>This is &#8212; also amounts to two thirds of the resources the President proposed in the respective jobs &#8212; American Jobs Plan categories. <br> <br>And as the President also made very clear, on dual tracks, we&#8217;re going full steam ahead for the rest of his Build Back Better Plan &#8212; this is what I was saying earlier: He&#8217;s not going to give up on his legislative agenda &#8212; working with the Senate on a budget resolution that includes a fair tax system for the middle class, human infrastructure, the American Families Plan and other essential investments.  And we&#8217;re going to keep working together with &#8212; with every segment of our party and across the aisle to get all of this done.<br> <br>So, we&#8217;re going to continue to talk to, you know, Republicans and Democrats to get this done.  As you know, this bipartisan &#8212; bipartisanship that we came together with was 10 Republicans and 10 Democrats, and so we&#8217;re going to continue that work.<br> <br>Q    Senator Schumer recommended the White House extend student loan benefits through March this week &#8212; the college student loan benefits &#8212; (inaudible), where we’re not paying back the interest.  Is that something that&#8217;s under consideration by the White House?<br> <br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Let me &#8212; let me get back and talk to our team.  I don&#8217;t have any update on that right at this moment.  As you know, COVID really, really hurt many Americans, including students.  And so let me get back to you on that.  I don&#8217;t have any update.<br> <br>Q    The President is in North Carolina today, and the First Lady is in Florida.  Did the White House, you know, pick areas that are particularly under-vaccinated?  Or how did it choose to go to the states where it&#8217;s really kind of ramping up this outreach effort?<br> <br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.  You know, as I said at the top, or as you just mentioned, you know, members of our administration are blitzing the country to highlight the efforts &#8212; local communities hard work to get more people vaccinated. <br> <br>You know, the local efforts are making a difference, you know?  And we &#8212; we are &#8212; this is a grassroots operation that we&#8217;ve been talking about for the past couple of weeks. <br> <br>And so this is incredibly important to have our principals out there.  Like I said earlier, when they&#8217;re there, they get that &#8212; you know, they get the local press there to lift up what they&#8217;re doing on the ground.  And everything that folks are doing on the ground is critical &#8212; is mission critical in getting people vaccinated.  And we have to continue to make sure we get the word out there and people understand why it&#8217;s so important to get vaccinated, in order to continue to get back to normal.<br> <br>Q    Karine, we have the Afghan President Ashraf Ghani’s visit to the White House tomorrow.  Can you preview what the President hopes to accomplish?  Should we expect announcements on security at the Kabul airport and other &#8212; and any updates on the timeline for withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan?<br> <br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.  So &#8212; (Air Force One experiences turbulence) &#8212; it is bumpy. <br> <br>So, this visit is a &#8212; is, first, is &#8212; is first about our ongoing commitment and support to the Afghan people and to the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces. <br> <br>As we continue to undertake our security transition, Afghanistan has experienced a significant COVID outbreak of the Delta variant, and we will be providing 3 million doses of Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine to the people of Afghanistan to be shipped as soon as next week, pending logistics.  We are also providing oxygen and other supplies. <br> <br>The newest COVID support, which is &#8212; which is from the tranche of the 55 million doses we announced on Monday, is distinct from the further $266 million in humanitarian assistance Secretary Blinken announced on June 4th. <br> <br>We are also continuing security assistance through DOD’s Afghan- &#8212; Afghanistan Security Forces Fund to provide financial support to the Afghan National Army National, Afghan National Police, Afghan Air Force, and Afghan Special Security Forces, including the special mission wing.<br> <br>Congress appropriated over $3 billion to ASFF in 2021, and the President has requested over $3.3 billion for 2022.<br> <br>Second, the President will emphasize the need for unity, cohesion, and for the Afghan government to focus on key challenges Afghanistan faces.<br> <br>We will welcome both President Ghani and Chairman Abdullah.  And one of the important messages we will be stressing is the need for the leaders to be a united front as they address security and other challenges.<br> <br>(Air Force One experiences turbulence.)  It&#8217;s getting bumpy here.  We&#8217;re about to land.  Here we go. <br> <br>Third, we will &#8212; third, we will emphasize our continuing diplomatic support for the peace process and for all Afghan parties to engage in good faith in that process.<br> <br>Obviously, these are significant challenges to this complex peace effort, but we believe that a negotiated political settlement is the best way to end the conflict, and we’ll continue to support those efforts.<br> <br>Since 2002, the United States has provided nearly $88 billion in security assistance; $36 billion in civilian assistance, including $787 million specifically intended to support Afghan women and girls; and nearly $3.9 billion in humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan.<br> <br>Q    Nothing on the airport that you’re expecting?  Nothing on the Kabul airport that you know?  No announcements on &#8212;<br> <br>Q    (Inaudible) Erdoğan meeting &#8212;<br> <br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I mean &#8212; so, as far as the security situation/assessment in general, we are seeing elevated attacks on ANDSF and Afghan government versus a year ago.  Right?  But no increase in attacks on our military or presence since February 2020.<br> <br>We assess that we had not &#8212; if we had not begun to draw down, violence would have increased against us as well after May 1st.  So, the status quo was not an option.<br> <br>So, we would also note that the &#8212; much of this is Taliban violence, but some is attributable to other groups, like ISIS-K, that were obviously not part of any negotiations or engagements, and that the Taliban is also fighting.<br> <br>Q    Thanks, Karine.<br> <br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Thank you.<br> <br>3:47 P.M. EDT</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p class="has-text-align-center">East Room</p>



<p>2:03 P.M. EDT</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Please, please be seated.&nbsp; I got my notes here.&nbsp; Well, good afternoon.&nbsp; If you hear a little noise in the background, it&#8217;s because I&#8217;m supposed to be getting on a helicopter to head to North Carolina, which I&#8217;m going to be doing short- &#8212; right after this.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And the Vice President and I, though, want to lay out what we&#8217;ve just settled, at least for the moment, with our friends &#8212; the bipartisan group of senators.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I said many times before: There&#8217;s nothing our nation can&#8217;t do when we decide to do it together, do it as one nation.&nbsp; Today is the latest example of that truth, in my view.&nbsp; I&#8217;m pleased to report that a bipartisan group of senators &#8212; five Democrats, five Republicans &#8212; part of a larger group &#8212; have come together and forged an agreement that will create millions of American jobs and modernize our American infrastructure to compete with the rest of the world and own the 21st century.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I want to thank them for working together and for raising their ideas and concerns with me and with the Vice President, as well as with our Jobs Cabinet: Secretaries Buttigieg is here &#8212; good to see you, Mr. Secretary.&nbsp; Secretary Fudge.&nbsp; Secretary Granholm.&nbsp; Secretary &#8212; there you are &#8212; okay, you guys to make sure I &#8212; I &#8212; I thought everybody was on this side.&nbsp; I was &#8211;(laughs).&nbsp; Secretary Raimondo and Secretary Walsh.</p>



<p>I also want to thank Senator Shelley Capito for her earlier work on an infrastructure agreement.&nbsp; We didn&#8217;t reach an agreement, but she tried her best to get something done.&nbsp; I&#8217;m sure it helped produce the final agreement we have.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The fact is, investment in jobs and infrastructure have often had bipartisan support in the past.&nbsp; Matter of fact, when I first got to the United States Senate, it was probably the least difficult thing to do &#8212; is pass infrastructure plans.&nbsp; But even so, it&#8217;s been a very long time since the last time our country was able to strike a major bipartisan deal on American infrastructure &#8212; which is so badly needed, I might add.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We devoted far too much energy to competing with one another and not nearly enough energy competing with the rest of the world to win the 21st century.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The investments we&#8217;ll be making as a result of this deal are long overdue.&nbsp; They&#8217;ll put Americans to work in good-paying jobs repairing our roads and our bridges.&nbsp; They&#8217;ll deliver high-speed Internet to every American home, bringing down the price that people pay now for Internet service.&nbsp; And they&#8217;ll close the American digital divide &#8212; as been driven home by every mother and father with a child at home during the COVID crisis, that is, thank God, abating.&nbsp; And kids not being able to be in school.</p>



<p>This is going to put plumbers and pipefitters to work.&nbsp; It&#8217;s going to replace 100 percent of the nation&#8217;s lead water pipes so that every child and every American could turn on the faucet at home or at school and drink clean water, including in low-income communities and communities of color that have been disproportionately affected by lead pipes and the consequences of that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This still makes key investments to put people to work all across the country building transmission lines, upgrading the power grid to be more ener- &#8212; more energy efficient and resilient in extreme weather &#8212; to be able to sustain extreme weather and the &#8212; and the climate crisis.&nbsp; It also builds our natural infrastructure &#8212; our coastlines and our &#8212; and our levees &#8212; to be more resilient as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>American workers will be installing electric vehicle charging stations and undertaking critical environmental cleanups.&nbsp; This bipartisan agreement represents the largest investment in public transit in American history.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I might add that &#8212; the largest investment in rail, since the creation of Amtrak.&nbsp; You all know I have nothing but affection for Amtrak, having traveled over a million miles on it, commuting every day.&nbsp; But it&#8217;s a big deal.</p>



<p>This agreement is going to create a new financing authority that&#8217;s going to leverage private capital and infrastructure and clean energy projects that will provide folks with good-paying jobs that can&#8217;t be outsourced &#8212; the kinds of jobs that provide middle-class &#8212; a middle-class life with a little bit of breathing room &#8212; a little bit of breathing room for American families.&nbsp;</p>



<p>My dad used to say, &#8220;Being in the middle class is just being able to take that extra breath.&#8221;&nbsp; I mean it sincerely.&nbsp; Think about it.&nbsp; Think about all the people who can&#8217;t take that breath because they don&#8217;t &#8212; they have no margin for error.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re &#8212; and we&#8217;re &#8212; and we&#8217;re going to do it all without raising a cent from earners below $400,000.&nbsp; There&#8217;s no gas tax increase, no fee on electric vehicles.&nbsp; And the fact is, we&#8217;re going to help ensure that &#8212; we&#8217;re going to make sure that everybody in America is in a position to be able to do what need be done.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so what I&#8217;ve &#8212; because &#8212; and let me be clear: We&#8217;re in a race with China and the rest of the world for the 21st century.&nbsp; They&#8217;re not waiting.&nbsp; They&#8217;re investing tens of billions of dollars across the board.&nbsp; Tens of billions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I just came back from Europe with &#8212; meeting with the G7, as well as with NATO, as well as the EU, and as well as with Mr. Putin &#8212; all separately.&nbsp; There&#8217;s massive investment going on in the &#8212; among the autocrats.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the underlying questions is: Can democracies compete with autocratic enterprises in the 21st century?&nbsp; And this is a big move toward that, being able to compete.&nbsp; We have to move, and we have to move fast.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And this agreement singles &#8212; signals to the world that we can function, deliver, and do significant things.&nbsp; These investment rep- &#8212; these investments represent the kind of national effort that, throughout our history, has literally &#8212; not figuratively &#8212; literally transformed America and propelled us into the future.&nbsp; The transcontinental railroad, the Interstate Highway System &#8212; investments that we made together that only our government was in a position to make.</p>



<p>Now we&#8217;re poised to add a new chapter in that American tradition.&nbsp; Let me be clear: Neither side got everything they wanted in this deal, and that&#8217;s what it means to compromise.&nbsp; And it reflects something important: It reflects consensus.&nbsp; The heart of democracy requires consensus.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s time a true &#8212; this time a true bipartisan effort, breaking the ice that too often has kept us frozen in place and prevented us from solving the real problems facing the American people.</p>



<p>This deal &#8212; this deal means millions of good-paying jobs, and fewer burdens felt at the kitchen table and across the country, and safer and healthier communities.&nbsp; But it also signals to ourselves and to the world that American democracy can deliver.&nbsp; And because of that, it represents an important step forward for our country.</p>



<p>I want to be clear about something else: Today is a huge day for one half of my economic agenda, the American Jobs Plan.&nbsp; It delivers on clean transportation, clear water and clean water, universal broadband, clean power infrastructure, and environmental resilience.</p>



<p>In these areas, it invests two thirds of the resources that I proposed in my American Jobs Plan.&nbsp; Two thirds of what I called for in those areas.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But I’m getting to work with Congress right &#8212; right away on the other half of my economic agenda as well &#8212; the American Family Plan &#8212; to finish the job on childcare, education, the caring economy, clean energy tax cuts &#8212; clean energy, and tax cuts for American families, and much more.</p>



<p>For me, investment in our physical and human infrastructure are inextricably intertwined.&nbsp; Both make us better off and stronger.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The case for these investments is clear.&nbsp; Economists &#8212; left, right, and center &#8212; independent Wall Street forecasters, they all say that these kinds of public investments mean more jobs, more workers participating in the labor force, higher productivity, and higher growth for our economy over the long run.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Both need to get done, and I’m going to work closely with Speaker Pelosi and Leader Schumer to make sure that both move through the legislative process promptly and in tandem.&nbsp; Let me emphasize that: and in tandem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We need physical infrastructure, but we also need the human infrastructure as well.&nbsp; They’re a part of my overall plan.&nbsp; What we agreed on today is what we could agree on: the physical infrastructure.&nbsp; There was no agreement on the rest.&nbsp; We’re going to have to do that through the budget process.</p>



<p>And we need a fairer tax system to pay for it all.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I’m not going to rest until it all &#8212; both get to my desk.</p>



<p>And lastly, I know there are some of my party who discouraged me from seeking an agreement with our Republican colleagues, who said that we should, “Go bigger and go alone.”</p>



<p>To them, I say this: I have already shown, in my young presidency, that I am prepared to do whatever needs to get done to move the country forward.&nbsp; That’s what I did with the American Rescue Plan, which was $1.9 trillion.</p>



<p>But let me say this: When we can’t &#8212; when we can find common ground, though, working across party lines, that is what I will seek to do.</p>



<p>The reason why is because broader support for a proposal has &#8212; the broader support a proposal has in Congress, the stronger its prospects for passage.&nbsp; Working together when we can allows us to make bipartisan process [progress] whenever possible without foreclosing the right and the necessity of moving forward on a &#8212; on a major &#8212; on a majority basis when we are at deep odds with one another.&nbsp; So-called “reconciliation progress &#8212; process.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>And for the &#8212; for the deal being announced today, there is plenty of work ahead to bring this home.&nbsp; It’s going to require hard work and collaboration.&nbsp; The committee chairs and the ranking members are going to play a major part.&nbsp; There are going to be disagreements to resolve and more compromise to be forged along the way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But this group of senators and all of the American people can be proud today because we have reaffirmed, once again, that we are the United States of America.&nbsp; There’s not a single thing beyond our capacity that we aren’t able to do when we do it together.</p>



<p>I know a lot of you in the press, particularly, doubt that unity is possible, that anything bipartisan is possible.&nbsp; It’s hard, but it’s necessary.&nbsp; And it can get done.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, I want to thank you all.&nbsp; And God bless you.&nbsp; And now I’ll take a few questions, before the helicopter leaves without me, from the press.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. President, what assurances do you have at this point that you have sufficient Democratic support, both in the Senate and the House, to move both on this bipartisan deal and on the reconciliation package?</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; You always ask me those things.&nbsp; Nobody knows for certain.&nbsp; It’s your job, but you know it’s not a reasonable question.&nbsp; And the reason I say that &#8212; I (inaudible) being critical &#8212; the idea of my telling you now that I know what every senator &#8212; how they’re going to vote is just not &#8212; I don’t know that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I do know that among the roughly 20 bipartisan groups of senators and congr- &#8212; senators that I met with &#8212; only 10 were here today, but that group &#8212; that we had an agreement.</p>



<p>For example, you know &#8212; and you know, they talk about, “Well, why would Biden compromise?”&nbsp; Well, when’s the last time &#8212;</p>



<p>If you had asked me whether or not I&#8217;d be able to get passenger rail service or 66 billion dollars’ worth &#8212; largest investment ever since Amtrak came about.&nbsp; I asked for $90 [billion] and got $66 billion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Talk about public transit: $49 billion &#8212; $49 billion for public transit.&nbsp; When I raised that before, some of you looked at me like, “Where have you been, Biden?&nbsp; You&#8217;ve been spending too much in China or something.”&nbsp; I hadn&#8217;t been to China.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You know, electric buses &#8212; $7.5 billion.&nbsp; I asked for $15 [billion].&nbsp; I couldn&#8217;t get all of it, but I &#8212; we compromised.&nbsp; Electric infrastructure &#8212; that is charging stations along the roads.&nbsp; I got &#8212; I asked for fifteen; I got seven and a half.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These are significant down payments on things that we finally got after negotia- &#8212; skillful negotiation on the part of my Cabinet and my team, led by Mr. Ricchetti.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so, when you ask me what guarantee do I have that I have all the votes I need: I don&#8217;t have any guarantee, but what I do have is a pretty good read, over the years, of how the Congress and the Senate works.&nbsp; And the idea that we&#8217;re not going &#8212; because someone is not going to be able to get every single thing they want, they&#8217;re going to vote against some of the things that I just named with nothing in here that&#8217;s, quote, “bad” for the environment, “bad” for the economy, “bad” for the transportation is unlikely.&nbsp; But I can&#8217;t guarantee it.&nbsp; You know that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yes.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. President, talk a little more about your interactions with Republicans specifically.&nbsp; You said earlier, “They&#8217;ve given me their word.&nbsp; Where I come from, that’s good enough for me.”&nbsp; To skeptics in your own party, what is it about the conversations you&#8217;ve had recently with Republicans that gives you so much hope?&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, secondly, you had said earlier you might have more to say about the situation down in South Beach, in Miami.&nbsp; Just curious &#8212;</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; I&#8217;m going to stick to &#8212; I will, at the end, answer your South Beach question.&nbsp; But let me &#8212; so we have some coherence here.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Number one, I&#8217;ve worked with a lot of these people who are in the room.&nbsp; I know them.&nbsp; Everybody knows and you guys know: When certain senators tell you something, they mean it.&nbsp; Snd others you take &#8212; you discount.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Where I come from and the &#8212; in my years in the Senate, the single greatest currency you have is your word &#8212; keeping your word.&nbsp; Mitt Romney has never broken his word to me.&nbsp; You know, the senator from Alaska and the senator of New Hampshire, they&#8217;ve never broken their wor- &#8212; I &#8212; from Maine &#8212; they&#8217;ve never broken their word.&nbsp; They&#8217;re friends.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so, the people I was with today are people that I trust.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t agree with them on a lot of things, but I trust them when they say, “This is a deal.&nbsp; We&#8217;ll stick to the deal.” Just like I doubt that you&#8217;ll find any one of them who say they don&#8217;t trust me when I said, “Okay, this is the deal &#8212; on these issues, this is a deal we&#8217;ll stick with.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>But, for example, there&#8217;s &#8212; and I made it clear today &#8212; there&#8217;s other things in the environment I want to get done.&nbsp; I think we should have the $300 billion tax credit for dealing with the environment.&nbsp; It (inaudible) giant tax cuts for corporations, but it’ll also be a giant move toward weatherizing every building in America and all the things that we need to do.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, there are things &#8212; and so, when I said, “We agree,” I&#8217;m not going to go back and renegotiate the Amtrak piece, but I am going to fight for trying to get $300 billion more for tax credits for the environment.&nbsp; That&#8217;s about as best that I can answer the question.</p>



<p>Yes, ma&#8217;am.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. President, can you answer a ques- &#8212; thank you so much.&nbsp; My question is on the timeline.&nbsp; There are families who are looking at the Families Plan and wondering when the help is coming.&nbsp; Can you talk &#8212; I know you said they&#8217;re going to be “promptly and in tandem,&#8221; but can you say anything more about that?</p>



<p>And what does this signal for future deals?&nbsp; There&#8217;s still things like voting rights and policing reform that are not able to get bipartisan deals.&nbsp; What does this tell you?&nbsp; What have you learned in talking to Republicans about what would happen in the future?</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Let me take &#8212; you asked three essay questions &#8212; and legitimate questions, but you asked three of them.&nbsp; The first one related to what, again?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first one is on the timeline.&nbsp; When do you think this two-track (inaudible)?</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Timeline.&nbsp; And you said, “when people are waiting for relief.”</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes.</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; I got them &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Inaudible.)</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; &#8212; $1.9 trillion in relief so far.&nbsp; They&#8217;re going to be getting checks in the mail that are consequential, this week, for childcare.&nbsp; A lot has been happened already.&nbsp; Number one.</p>



<p>Number two, I&#8217;m going to fight like heck to get them the rest of what I think has to be done.&nbsp; On education, for example, my proposal was, in the Family Plan, early education and free community college.&nbsp; I&#8217;m going to fight like the devil to get that done, but it&#8217;s not going to be with Republican help.&nbsp; I&#8217;m going to have to get every Democrat and do it through reconciliation if it gets done.&nbsp; So that&#8217;s number one.</p>



<p>The &#8212; I think, based on my being out on the street and polling data, I think the people who need the help the most trust me to be fighting to get them the help they need.&nbsp; They know who I am, and they know my record.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With regard to the issue of what &#8212; what about voting rights &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Inaudible.)</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Voting rights is maybe the most consequential thing, I think, with &#8212; I&#8217;m going to be going around the country, spending time making the case to the American people that this just isn&#8217;t about iden- &#8212; showing an identification that, &#8220;This is who I am when I vote.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This isn&#8217;t just about whether or not &#8212; excuse me &#8212; you can provide water for someone standing in line while they&#8217;re waiting to vote.&nbsp; This is about who gets to judge whether your vote counted after it&#8217;s been cast.&nbsp; Think about it.</p>



<p>Up to now, every state and the federal government has assumed that there would be officials who were appointed and/or elected in states where the election commissioners &#8212; bound by an oath that they would uphold certain requirements to make sure the vote was honest and fair.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What these guys are trying to do now, in ro- &#8212; rough approximation, is say that, “If we don’t like the vote turned out and we control the state legislature, we&#8217;re going to say the vote didn&#8217;t count and we&#8217;re going to recount.&#8221;&nbsp; That&#8217;s never happened before.&nbsp; It&#8217;s wrong.&nbsp; &#8220;Who in God&#8217;s name,&#8221; as my mother would say, &#8220;died and left them boss?&#8221;&nbsp; Your vote has to count when you cast it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There&#8217;s a lot of ancillary pieces of this legislation that I strongly support.&nbsp; I strongly support the idea that there&#8217;s no &#8212; there&#8217;s no prior &#8212; if I had my way, there&#8217;d be no private contributions to see who gets elected &#8212; how much money you raise.&nbsp; If I had my way &#8212; and I think it&#8217;s really important &#8212; that every Election Day would be a day off because people can&#8217;t go to &#8212; people who work certain shifts can&#8217;t make it to the election.&nbsp; I would make sure there&#8217;s automatic registration when you turn 18.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That&#8217;s what I think everybody thinks this fight is about, and it&#8217;s a worthy fight, but it&#8217;s much more profound than that.&nbsp; It&#8217;s about saying that the legislature in Georgia could decide, if it&#8217;s a Republican legislature, &#8220;You know, on reflection, we don&#8217;t think that election was fair.&nbsp; We&#8217;re going to vote to say it didn&#8217;t count.&#8221;&nbsp; It&#8217;s just simply wrong.&nbsp; It&#8217;s wrong.&nbsp; And in my view, it borders on being immoral.</p>



<p>This is the sacred right to vote.&nbsp; As John Lewis said, &#8220;It is the &#8212; the &#8212; the most important right you have.&#8221;&nbsp; And so, I&#8217;m going to be making the case across the country and, as best I can, to see (inaudible).</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. President?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. President, do you support critical &#8212;</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Let me go to this side.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. President, you said you want both of these measures to come to you &#8220;in tandem.&#8221;&nbsp; Did you receive any assurances that that would happen?&nbsp; And how do you anticipate &#8212; what will you do if &#8212;</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; I control that.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; they don&#8217;t get to you in time?</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; If they don&#8217;t come, I&#8217;m not signing.&nbsp; Real simple.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, but I expect &#8212; I expect that in the &#8212; the coming months this summer, before the count &#8212; the fiscal year is over, that we will have voted on this bill, as well &#8212; the infrastructure bill &#8212; as well as voted on the budget record [sic] &#8212; resolution.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And that&#8217;s when they&#8217;ll &#8212; but if only one comes to me, I&#8217;m not &#8212; and if this is the only thing that comes to me, I&#8217;m not signing it.&nbsp; It&#8217;s in tandem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. President, do you support, then, Speaker Pelosi&#8217;s stated plan to hold the bipartisan deal in the House until the Senate also passes reconciliation?&nbsp; Do you support that sequencing on her part?</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, Mr. President, your own party is not on the same page about the reconciliation package.&nbsp; So, by moving forward with this two-track system, are you putting the bipartisan bill in jeopardy?</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Sure, the bipartisan bill was &#8212; look, the bipartisan bill, from the very beginning, was understood there was going to have to be the second part of it.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not just signing the bipartisan bill and forgetting about the rest I &#8212; that I proposed.&nbsp; I proposed a significant piece of legislation in three parts.&nbsp; And all &#8212; all three parts are equally important.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, by the way, my party &#8212; you keep &#8212; everybody tell &#8212; tells me my party is &#8212; my party is divided.&nbsp; Well, my party is divided.&nbsp; My party is divided, but my party is also rational.&nbsp; If they can&#8217;t get every single thing they want, but all that they have in the bill is that &#8212; before them is good, are they going to vote &#8220;no&#8221;?&nbsp; I don&#8217;t think so.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. President?</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Yes.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. President, are you &#8212; 48 hours ago, it seemed like this deal was kind of in a rough place or didn&#8217;t necessarily have a path forward.&nbsp; What clinched it?&nbsp; What changed the dynamic that you saw?&nbsp; And also, would you be willing to include a debt ceiling increase in either of the two vehicles you&#8217;re talking about?&nbsp;</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; They&#8217;re probably going (inaudible) be debt ceiling.&nbsp; Whether it&#8217;s included in either of these bills is not relevant.&nbsp; It depends on what the &#8212; the leadership in the House and Senate thinks how they should proceed, number one.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Number two, you notice, I didn&#8217;t have that bleak view you all had.&nbsp; You said, 48 hours ago, it didn&#8217;t look good.&nbsp; It looked good to me 48 hours ago.&nbsp; It looked good to our team 48 hours ago.&nbsp; Seventy-two hours ago, it looked good, too.&nbsp; It wasn’t there yet.</p>



<p>But you guys know me too well.&nbsp; And it’s &#8212; I’m going to drive you crazy the next four years because I’m going to tell you the truth as I see it.&nbsp; I know the Senate and the House better than most of you know it.&nbsp; I’ve been &#8212; my whole life, that’s what I’ve done.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It doesn’t mean I’m going to turn out to be right all the time, but I&#8217;m not going to negotiate with the press while I&#8217;m negotiating with the &#8212; privately with my colleagues.&nbsp; And these are really tough decisions senators have got.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t, in any way, dismiss what Senator Murphy says about the environment.&nbsp; I don’t dismiss it at all.&nbsp; Especially (inaudible).&nbsp; I wrote the bill on the environment.&nbsp; Why would I not be for it?</p>



<p>The question is: How much can we get done?&nbsp; And the bottom line is: When all is said and done, does what you agree to preclude, forever, you getting the things you really want?&nbsp; Well, I’m not for that.&nbsp; I’m not going to vote for one of those deals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Secondly, do you get all of what you wanted?&nbsp; Or do you come back and fight another day?&nbsp;</p>



<p>I’ve been President about 150 days.&nbsp; I think we’ve done fairly well so far.&nbsp; Not because of me, but because of the way the system works.</p>



<p>So, it&#8217;s not &#8212; I mean, I &#8212; I know that doesn’t answer any of your questions about, “Can you tell me when?” and “How are you going to do it?”&nbsp; I just feel that the best way to get a senator or a congressperson who supports the essence of what&#8217;s already there, but says, “I don&#8217;t have enough of what&#8217;s there, of other things” &#8212; the best way to get that message across is go to the constituents, and say, “Here&#8217;s &#8212; here&#8217;s what&#8217;s on the table.&nbsp; Do you think your senator, your congressman should vote for that?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, you campaign.&nbsp; The campaign doesn&#8217;t stop; the partisan piece stops, in terms of, “I’m against Charlie Smith or Harry Wilson.”&nbsp; But that doesn&#8217;t stop &#8212; I mean, that stops.&nbsp; But what doesn&#8217;t stop is to the saying, “You&#8217;re…” &#8212; it&#8217;s like on a &#8212; last example I&#8217;ll give.&nbsp; I promise I won&#8217;t do this to you again. But remember: In 2018, everybody said, “Well, you know, we&#8217;re going to lose.&nbsp; The Democrats are going to lose.&nbsp; You know, the House and Senate, they&#8217;re not going to make &#8212; the House is not going to make gains.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I went into over 60 congressional districts.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t go after the individual congresspersons who were against making sure that we kept the Affordable Care Act.&nbsp; But I went to their constituents and said, “The Affordable Care Act is really important.”&nbsp; We had large crowds show up.&nbsp; And I’d say, “Here&#8217;s why I think you should do it.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why, if I were you, I&#8217;d take a look at what Charlie Smith says and Harry Wilson says.&nbsp; He&#8217;s for it.&nbsp; She&#8217;s not.”&nbsp; Or &#8220;She&#8217;s for it; he&#8217;s not.&#8221;&nbsp; And guess what?&nbsp; We won, what, 40 some seats?</p>



<p>So, it&#8217;s not just convincing this particular congressperson.&nbsp; It&#8217;s making a rational case, if you can, in their communities why this is important to get done.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I think the fact that I didn&#8217;t get everything now at this moment &#8212; for example, a lot of our housing pieces didn&#8217;t get passed.&nbsp; We&#8217;re coming back at it though.&nbsp; We’re coming back at it.&nbsp; We’re going to make the case.&nbsp; And if I make the case to the public at large &#8212; the one thing I can say for all of you, you do accurately report what I say.&nbsp; The problem is I disappoint you because I can&#8217;t answer all your questions and negotiate with you before I negotiate with my colleagues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But I really think we &#8212; the public understands and they&#8217;re seeing the proof is in what&#8217;s happening.&nbsp; It’s now projected our economy is going to grow above 7 percent this year.&nbsp; Projections from Wall Street to the Fed: It’s going to continue to grow.&nbsp; We&#8217;re going to increase more &#8212; and guess what?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Remember you were asking me &#8212; and I&#8217;m not being critical of you all; I really mean this.&nbsp; It was legitimate questions you were asking me &#8212; asking me, “Well, you know, guess what?&nbsp; Employers can&#8217;t find workers.”&nbsp; I said, “Yeah.&nbsp; Pay them more.”&nbsp; This is an employee&#8217;s &#8212; employee’s bargaining chip now what&#8217;s happening.&nbsp; They&#8217;re going to have to compete and start playing [sic] hardworking people a decent wage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, by the way &#8212; talking inflation &#8212; the overwhelming consensus is it’s going to pop up a little bit and then go back down.&nbsp; No one is talking about, “This great, great deal.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, again, if it turns out that what I&#8217;ve done so far &#8212; what we&#8217;ve done so far is a mistake, it&#8217;s going to show.&nbsp; It&#8217;s going to show.&nbsp; The economy is not going to grow, like it wasn&#8217;t before.&nbsp; People aren&#8217;t going to have jobs with increased pay, like it was before.&nbsp; People are going to be out of work, like it was before, with no options.&nbsp; Unemployment is going to continue to climb, instead of continue to go down.&nbsp; If that happens, then my policies didn’t make a lot of sense, but I&#8217;m counting on it not.&nbsp; That&#8217;s my counting how it&#8217;s working.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve got to get a helicopter (inaudible).&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. President, will you travel to Florida, sir?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can we ask you about Florida &#8212; what you&#8217;ve learned and what you&#8217;ve (inaudible)?</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Oh, yes.&nbsp; I apologize.&nbsp; Yes, thank you. (Inaudible) President.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve spoken with, coincidentally, the mayor of Miami-Dade, who was in my office yesterday.&nbsp; And I talked to her today &#8212; not about that, obviously &#8212; and so I had a long discussion with her today.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve also spoken with &#8212; we&#8217;ve been in contact with the Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who has that district.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve gotten in touch with FEMA.&nbsp; They&#8217;re ready to go.&nbsp; The governor is going to have to &#8212; we can&#8217;t &#8212; they&#8217;re &#8212; they&#8217;re down inspecting in what is &#8212; what they think is needed.&nbsp; But I&#8217;m waiting for the governor to ask for &#8212; declare an emergency if &#8212; and especially as we learn more about what the rest &#8212; might happen with the rest of the building.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, we are on top of it.&nbsp; We are ready to move, from the federal resources, immediately &#8212; immediately, if in fact we’re asked for it.&nbsp; But we can&#8217;t go in and do it &#8212; but the &#8212; FEMA is down there taking a look at what&#8217;s needed, and &#8212; including from everything from &#8212; if the rest of those buildings have to be evacuated as well; finding housing for those people; making sure they have the capacity to both have a place to &#8212; to shelter, and food to eat, et cetera.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So that&#8217;s underway now, and I&#8217;m &#8212; my Chief of Staff has been deeply involved in this from the very beginning.&nbsp; We got the Cabinet involved in it now, in terms of dealing with FEMA.&nbsp; We&#8217;re working on it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I made it clear that I say to the people of Florida: Whatever help you want that the federal government can provide, we&#8217;re waiting.&nbsp; Just ask us; we&#8217;ll be there.&nbsp; We&#8217;ll be there.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, thank you so much.&nbsp; I appreciate it.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. President, one quick que- &#8212; what are you hoping the Vice President can do at the border tomorrow?</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; She&#8217;s done a great job so far.&nbsp; And the reason why it&#8217;s important that she go down: She&#8217;s now set up the criteria, having spoken with the President of Mexico and Guatemala, visited the region to know what we need to do.</p>



<p>Thank you very much.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you know anything on these reports about moving Afghan nationals to other countries who helped during the war?</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; They&#8217;re going to come.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve already begun the process.&nbsp; Those who helped us are not going to be left behind.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you know what country they&#8217;re going to move to first?&nbsp;</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; I don’t know that.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll be meeting with the &#8212; with Ghani tomorrow, the head &#8212; he&#8217;s coming to my office.&nbsp; That will be a discussion.&nbsp; But they&#8217;re welcome here, just like anyone else who risked their lives to help us.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, sir.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Biden Administration Mounts Whole-of-Government Response to Address Extreme Heat Impacting Nearly Half of U.S. and Boosting Climate Resilience</em></p>



<p>Today, National Climate Advisor Gina McCarthy convened the fourth National Climate Task Force meeting where she was joined by Cabinet members and senior leadership from 17 federal agencies. During the meeting, Biden Administration officials discussed the whole-of-government effort taking place to address historic and severe climate impacts currently facing communities across the United States, including record breaking heat waves, unprecedented drought and water scarcity, and devastating wildfires. Task Force members discussed a sobering summer outlook, identified near-term readiness plans in the face of extreme weather risks, and laid out long-term resilience measures that will help the nation fend off the worst impacts of climate change.</p>



<p>Additionally, agency leadership shared the climate-related challenges they are working to address:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra</strong>&nbsp;emphasized that record-breaking heat waves across the nation’s Western States pose a severe public health threat to tens of thousands of Americans, particularly in disadvantaged or vulnerable communities. The Center for Disease Control’s National Syndromic Surveillance Program data show that cases of heat related emergency room hospital visits increased from 857, in the first week of May, to 5313 in the week of June 13-19 – a six-fold increase.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Interior Secretary Deb Haaland</strong>&nbsp;discussed how climate-related impacts are displacing certain coastal communities, especially tribal and indigenous communities, in regions already dramatically influenced by climate change.&nbsp; More and more Alaska Native villages, for example, are experiencing increasingly dire impacts from climate change, including receding summer sea ice; storm-fueled coastal erosion; and thawing permafrost, which presents a risk to food security. President Biden’s American Jobs Plan includes a $2B investment for transition and relocation assistance to support community-led transitions in the most vulnerable communities.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack</strong>&nbsp;spoke about ongoing efforts to combat wildfire and drought, including a focus on forest management and natural solutions. He emphasized the Agriculture Department’s focus on building resilience to these challenges through climate-smart agriculture and forestry management. This approach is mirrored in President Biden’s American Job’s Plan, which includes an investment of more than $50B in resilience in the face of a changing climate.<br>&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Housing and Urban Development Deputy Secretary Adrianne Todman</strong>&nbsp;noted that our nation’s low-income families and communities of color are particularly susceptible to the impacts of climate change due to historic disinvestment, aging infrastructure, and the legacy of residential segregation. For example, historically the nation’s public housing stock has not been built to withstand extreme temperatures, thereby exacerbating health risks and resulting in crippling energy costs for residents. To address this need, HUD’s FY22 budget request proposes $800 million in energy, resilience, and healthy retrofits for federally subsidized housing and housing in Native American communities.<br>&nbsp;</li><li><strong>White House Council on Environmental Quality Chair Brenda Mallory&nbsp;</strong>noted that one of the most powerful and cost-effective strategies for combatting climate change and protecting communities from its impacts is through the conservation and restoration of natural lands and waters. Chair Mallory provided an update on the work that Federal agencies are doing through the Administration’s America the Beautiful initiative to support locally-led, voluntary stewardship efforts and to pursue the first-ever national conservation goal.</li></ul>



<p>To ensure resilient federal operations and physical footprints, agencies are preparing Climate Action Plans, per President Biden’s Executive Order 14008. These plans parallel many of the nation’s climate related vulnerabilities, including natural resources such as land and water resources; financial risk &#8212; including risks to assets, supplies, and services; and the health, safety, and availability of the Federal workforce.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Acting Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and&nbsp;Sustainment Stacy Cummings&nbsp;</strong>emphasized that around the world, climate change is a destabilizing force, creating new missions and impacting the operational environment. At the same time, climate-related extreme weather can affect military readiness and drain resources. For these reasons, the Department of Defense focused their Climate Adaptation Plan on building resilience across the entire Department in alignment with warfighting requirements.<br>&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Deputy Transportation Secretary Polly Trottenberg</strong>&nbsp;spoke about how the Department of Transportation is using their Climate Action Plan to explore a range of strategies that will guide decision making to make our transportation infrastructure more resilient. These strategies include building stronger or better by retrofitting existing infrastructure, adding network redundancy, relocating transportation assets to less vulnerable locations, and improving maintenance and operational strategies to respond to disruptions.</li></ul>



<p>As outlined by President Biden’s January 27 executive order on tackling the climate, the Task Force is chaired by the National Climate Advisor and includes Cabinet-level leaders from 21 federal agencies and senior White House officials to mobilize the Biden-Harris Administration’s implementation of a whole-of-government approach.</p>



<p><em>Task Force membership is comprised of the following government officials:</em></p>



<ul><li>National Climate Advisor (Chair)</li><li>Secretary of the Treasury</li><li>Secretary of Defense</li><li>Attorney General</li><li>Secretary of the Interior</li><li>Secretary of Agriculture</li><li>Secretary of Commerce</li><li>Secretary of Education</li><li>Secretary of Labor</li><li>Secretary of Health and Human Services</li><li>Secretary of Housing and Urban Development</li><li>Secretary of Transportation</li><li>Secretary of Energy</li><li>Secretary of Homeland Security</li><li>Administrator of General Services</li><li>Chair of the Council on Environmental Quality</li><li>Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency</li><li>Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration</li><li>Director of the Office of Management and Budget</li><li>Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy</li><li>Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy</li><li>Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs</li><li>Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism</li><li>Assistant to the President for Economic Policy</li></ul>
