										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>I have repeatedly said that America’s middle class deserves a tax cut, and we’re providing a significant tax cut to America’s working families with children through the largest-ever child tax credit.</p>



<p>Not only did the American Rescue Plan increase the child tax credit to $3000 for families whose children are between 6-17 years old and $3600 for families with children under 6 years old, it allows half of that tax cut to be paid to families in advance through a monthly check or direct deposit. This year, a family with two young children would receive a tax cut of $7200, with a monthly payment of $600 starting in July. Almost all families who have filed taxes in the last two years will receive this tax cut automatically.</p>



<p>This tax cut will give our nation’s hardworking families with children a little more breathing room when it comes to putting food on the table, paying the bills, and making ends meet. Nearly every working family with children is going to feel this tax cut make a difference in their lives, and we need to spread the word so that all eligible families get the full credit.</p>



<p>Just as Americans came together in support of the American Rescue Plan, we’re asking Americans to come together to build support and awareness for this vital tax relief for families, to help us extend it for years to come, and to ensure we get all children in our nation’s low-income families signed up this year.</p>



<p>If we’re able to get every family signed up, it will mean significant tax relief for America’s working families, and will help bring us even closer to cutting child poverty in half. That is why we have designated today, June 21, as Child Tax Credit Awareness Day. Across the nation, organizations that advocate for children, faith-based organizations and elected officials are holding events, training volunteers, announcing strategies to sign up the lowest income families, and using social media to explain how the Child Tax Credit will cut child poverty and why we must extend it through the American Families Plan.</p>



<p>To help or sign up, please go to ChildTaxCredit.Gov. It provides simple, useful information, in both English and Spanish, as well as a link to help families sign up.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For parents working to make ends meet and raise their children with greater security, dignity, and opportunity, help is here. On this Child Tax Credit Awareness day, let us all work together to make sure that the help that is here reaches those who most need it, this year and for years to come.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>These doses are the remaining part of the 80 million President Biden pledged to allocate by the end of June</em></p>



<p>Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing the distribution list for 55 million of the 80 million doses of America’s own vaccine supply President Biden has pledged to allocate by the end of June in service of ending the pandemic globally.  As we continue to fight the COVID-19 pandemic at home and work to end the pandemic worldwide, President Biden has promised that the United States will be an arsenal of vaccines for the world. Part of that plan is donating vaccine from our domestic supply, and the President has pledged 80 million doses to be allocated by the end of June. Earlier this month, the Administration announced the plan for <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/03/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-unveils-strategy-for-global-vaccine-sharing-announcing-allocation-plan-for-the-first-25-million-doses-to-be-shared-globally/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the first 25 million</a> doses that we have begun shipping, and today’s announcement completes the list for the remaining 55 million doses. For all of these doses, those most at risk, such as health care workers, should be prioritized, based on national vaccine plans.<br><br>In addition to sharing doses from our own vaccine supply, the Biden-Harris Administration is also committed to working with our U.S. manufacturers to produce more vaccine to share with the world. To that end, ahead of the G7, President Biden announced that the U.S. will purchase <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/10/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-historic-vaccine-donation-half-a-billion-pfizer-vaccines-to-the-worlds-lowest-income-nations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">half a billion Pfizer doses</a> and donate them to 92 low- and lower middle-income countries and members of the African Union. In total, the G7+ agreed to provide an additional more than 1 billion doses starting summer 2021. In addition, the U.S. is committed to <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/13/fact-sheet-united-states-and-g7-partners-will-provide-more-than-2-billion-vaccines-for-the-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">expanding local production of vaccines</a>, and through our Quad partnership and the International Development Finance Corporation’s support for vaccine manufacturing, more than 1 billion doses will be produced in Africa and India in 2021 and 2022. This vaccine strategy is a vital component of our overall global effort to lead the world in the fight to defeat COVID-19 and to achieve global health security.<br><br>For these 80 million doses, the U.S. will share 75% through COVAX and 25% will be targeted to help deal with surges around the world.  Our goals are to increase global COVID-19 vaccination coverage, prepare for surges and prioritize healthcare workers and other vulnerable populations based on public health data and acknowledged best practice, and help our neighbors and other countries in need.  And, as we have previously stated, the United States will not use its vaccines to secure favors from other countries. <br><br>Based on this framework and pending legal and regulatory approvals, <strong>the allocation plan for these 55 million doses will be as follows:  </strong></p>



<ul><li>Approximately 41 million will be shared through COVAX, with the following allocations:<ul><li>Approximately 14 million for Latin America and the Caribbean to the following: Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, Paraguay, Bolivia, Uruguay, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Haiti, and other Caribbean Community (CARICOM) countries, Dominican Republic, Panama, and Costa Rica.</li><li>Approximately 16 million for Asia to the following:  India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, Maldives, Bhutan, Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Laos, Papua New Guinea, Taiwan, Cambodia, and the Pacific Islands. </li><li>Approximately 10 million for Africa to be shared with countries that will be selected in coordination with the African Union. </li></ul></li><li>Approximately 14 million – or 25% of these 55 million vaccines – will be shared with regional priorities and other recipients, such as: Colombia, Argentina, Haiti, other CARICOM countries, Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, Panama, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia, South Africa, Nigeria, Kenya, Ghana, Cabo Verde, Egypt, Jordan, Iraq, Yemen, Tunisia, Oman, West Bank and Gaza, Ukraine, Kosovo, Georgia, Moldova, and Bosnia. </li></ul>



<p>Sharing millions of U.S. vaccines with other countries signals a major commitment by the U.S. Government.  Just like we have in our domestic response, we will move as expeditiously as possible, while abiding by U.S. and host country regulatory and legal requirements, to facilitate the safe and secure transport of vaccines across international borders.  This will take time, but the President has directed the Administration to use all the levers of the U.S. government to protect individuals from this virus as quickly as possible.  The specific vaccines and amounts will be determined and shared as the administration works through the logistical, regulatory and other parameters particular to each region and country.</p>

<p>President Biden looks forward to welcoming Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and Dr. Abdullah Abdullah, Chairman of the High Council for National Reconciliation, to the White House on June 25, 2021. The visit by President Ghani and Dr. Abdullah will highlight the enduring partnership between the United States and Afghanistan as the military drawdown continues. The United States is committed to supporting the Afghan people by providing diplomatic, economic, and humanitarian assistance to support the Afghan people, including Afghan women, girls and minorities. The United States will remain deeply engaged with the Government of Afghanistan to ensure the country never again becomes a safe haven for terrorist groups who pose a threat to the U.S. homeland.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>Today, I join people around the globe in commemorating World Refugee Day, a day when we recognize the courage and humanity of the millions forced to flee violence, persecution, and war. It is also a moment to honor the generosity of communities welcoming refugees and the bravery and dedication of humanitarian workers who provide life-saving assistance, often in challenging and dangerous conditions.</p>



<p>At a time when&nbsp;the number of refugees&nbsp;and other displaced persons&nbsp;has reached&nbsp;an&nbsp;alarming&nbsp;and&nbsp;historic high—more than 82 million&nbsp;worldwide—the United States&nbsp;has a moral obligation to ensure that refugees have access to life-saving care, opportunities to pursue an education, and livelihoods that allow them to live with dignity and hope for the future.&nbsp; On this day, we&nbsp;reaffirm our&nbsp;sacred&nbsp;commitment to alleviate suffering through humanitarian&nbsp;relief,&nbsp;and redouble our efforts to&nbsp;achieve&nbsp;lasting solutions for refugees—including through resettlement.&nbsp; We also recommit to engaging in diplomatic efforts to bring an end to the&nbsp;ongoing&nbsp;conflicts that compel refugees to seek safety elsewhere.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Protecting refugees is&nbsp;part of&nbsp;our DNA.&nbsp; Our nation was founded by those fleeing religious persecution.&nbsp; When we take action to help refugees around the world, we honor our past and live up to our highest values.&nbsp; We show our greatest strength as a nation.</p>



<p>We do this because it’s the right thing to do, but make no mistake:&nbsp; helping refugees helps the United States,&nbsp;too, bringing greater regional stability&nbsp;and making&nbsp;the world a safer place for all of us.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s why I&nbsp;revised the United States’ annual refugee admissions cap to 62,500 for this fiscal year, and plan to raise it to 125,000 next year. While meeting these targets will be a challenge, I have directed my Administration to work as quickly as possible&nbsp;to rebuild and improve refugee processing and to expand our capacity to admit refugees.&nbsp;&nbsp;We&nbsp;need to&nbsp;lead by example. &nbsp;And the refugees who arrive at our shores will&nbsp;continue to strengthen our communities, as they always have, bringing&nbsp;new life, energy, and ideas&nbsp;to our great country. The United States&nbsp;is proud to stand as a beacon of liberty and refuge to the world, and whether it’s taking in&nbsp;those seeking safety&nbsp;or providing more humanitarian relief than any other nation, we’re going to do our part.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our hearts are heavy today as we let you all know that our beloved German Shepherd, Champ, passed away peacefully at home. He was our constant, cherished companion during the last 13 years and was adored by the entire Biden family. Even as Champ’s strength waned in his last months, when we came into a room, he would immediately pull himself up, his tail always wagging, and nuzzle us for an ear scratch or a belly rub. Wherever we were, he wanted to be, and everything was instantly better when he was next to us. He loved nothing more than curling up at our feet in front of a fire at the end of the day, joining us as a comforting presence in meetings, or sunning himself in the White House garden. In his younger days, he was happiest chasing golf balls on the front lawn of the Naval Observatory or racing to catch our grandchildren as they ran around our backyard in Delaware. In our most joyful moments and in our most grief-stricken days, he was there with us, sensitive to our every unspoken feeling and emotion. We love our sweet, good boy and will miss him always. </p>

I’m pleased to announce that today we will have reached the mark of 300 million shots in the arms in just 150 days. Let me say that again: 300 million shots in arms in under 150 days. It’s an important milestone&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p class="has-text-align-center">State Dining Room</p>



<p>2:53 P.M. EDT</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT: Good afternoon. (Clears throat.) Excuse me. I’m pleased to announce that today we will have reached the mark of 300 million shots in the arms in just 150 days. Let me say that again: 300 million shots in arms in under 150 days.</p>



<p>It’s an important milestone that just didn’t happen on its own or by chance. It took the ingenuity of American scientists, the full capacity of American companies, and a whole-of-government response across federal, state, Tribal, and local governments.</p>



<p>Together, we built an unparalleled vaccination program and managed one of the biggest and most complicated logistical challenges in American history.</p>



<p>And above all, we got here because of the American people stepping up and getting vaccinated &#8212; helping family, friends, neighbors get vaccinated.</p>



<p>Just remember what the situation was like 150 days ago. We didn’t have enough vaccine supply for all Americans. We didn’t have the vaccine infrastructure or the people to administer the vaccines or the places where the people could get vaccinated. But we turned it around together by acting quickly and aggressively and equitably.</p>



<p>We secured enough vaccine supply for every American. And as I announced last week during my visit to Europe, we are now in a position to provide more than one half billion vaccine doses to the rest of the world &#8212; the 100 poorest nations.</p>



<p>We’ve developed and deployed over 9,000 federal personnel, including 5,100 active duty military, to support the vaccine effort and to get shots into arms. And now, we have more than 81,000 vaccination sites across the country, including over 42,000 local pharmacies.</p>



<p>Thanks to this wartime response, we have gotten 300 million shots in the arms of Americans in 150 days, months ahead of what most anyone thought was possible when we started.</p>



<p>In fact, if you remember, a lot of people were skeptical that we could even get 100 million shots in my first 100 days into people’s arms. But we did it. We kept going. And what we’re seeing is a truly American accomplishment.</p>



<p>Sixty-five percent &#8212; sixty-five percent &#8212; of American adults have gotten at least one shot, including eighty-seven percent of our seniors.</p>



<p>Just five months ago, we were at only 5 percent of adult Americans. Fifteen states and the District of Columbia have now reached at least 70 percent vaccination rate in their state. Twenty-six states and D.C. have fully vaccinated &#8212; (clears throat) &#8212; excuse me &#8212; 50 percent or more of the adults.</p>



<p>Nationwide, we have the lowest number of daily deaths<br>since the first days of the pandemic.</p>



<p>And we’ve built equity into the heart of our vaccination program from day one. Seventy-three percent of the shots administered at community health centers through the federal program and more than fifty-eight percent of the shots administered by federally-run vaccination sites have gone to people of color. And across the nation, people of color have accounted for more than half of all vaccinations in the last month. That’s important progress, but we have much more to do.</p>



<p>Vice President Harris is, as I speak &#8212; is in Atlanta, getting the word out about the vaccinations.</p>



<p>Yesterday, I signed a bill &#8212; (clears throat) &#8212; excuse me &#8212; into law making Juneteenth a federal holiday.</p>



<p>And this weekend, folks in communities across the country are going to be canvassing and hosting events to encourage their families, friends, and neighbors to get vaccinated. The more we close the racial gap in vaccination rates, the more lives we’ll save.</p>



<p>And as our vaccination program is saying &#8212; saving tens of thousands of lives, with that count growing each day, it’s also allowing millions of Americans to get back to living their lives. Grandparents hugging their kids. Kids back to school and getting ready for the summer. People going out to restaurants and traveling. Businesses are reopening.</p>



<p>Folks, we’re heading into a very different summer compared to last year. A bright summer. Prayerfully, a summer of joy.</p>



<p>But as I promised you from the beginning, I will always give it to you straight: the good, the bad, and the truth. And the truth is that deaths and hospitalizations are drastically down in places where people are getting vaccinated. But unfortunately, cases and hospitalizations are not going down<br>in many places in the lower-vaccination-rate states. They&#8217;re actually going up in some places.</p>



<p>A few days ago, we crossed 600,000 &#8212; 600,000 Americans dead from COVID, more than every death in World War One, World War Two, Vietnam, and 9/11 combined. So even while we’re making incredible progress, it remains a serious and deadly threat.</p>



<p>And the data is clear: If you are unvaccinated, you&#8217;re at risk of getting seriously ill or dying or spreading it. People getting seriously ill and being hospitalized due to COVID-19 are those who have not been fully vaccinated. The new variant will leave unvaccinated people even more vulnerable than they are a month ago &#8212; over a month ago.</p>



<p>This is a serious concern, especially because of what experts are calling the &#8220;Delta&#8221; vir- &#8212; the &#8220;Delta&#8221; variant. It’s a variant that is more easily transmissible, potentially deadlier, and particularly dangerous for young people.</p>



<p>But the good news is, we have the solution.The science and the data are clear: The best way to protect yourself against these variants are to get fully vaccinated.</p>



<p>So, please, please, if you have one shot, get the second shot as soon as you can so you&#8217;re fully vaccinated. And if you haven’t gotten vaccinated yet, get vaccinated now. Now. Don’t put it off. It’s free. It’s easy. It’s convenient.</p>



<p>And as I said many times, text your ZIP Code to the numbers 438829 &#8212; 438829 &#8212; to find the sites where you can get vaccinated closest to you. Get your free Uber or Lyft ride to and from vaccination sites. I want to thank Uber and Lyft for their cooperation.</p>



<p>Use the extended hours at thousands of pharmacies in June, including thousands that are open 24/7 on Friday of this month. Most pharmacies now offer walk-in vaccinations. No appointment is needed.</p>



<p>Employers with less than 500 employees: The federal government is providing you a tax credit to give your workers paid time off to get vaccinated and recover if they need be.</p>



<p>And for anyone who still questions, that’s okay if you still have questions. But act &#8212; act now. Act now. Talk to your family and friends who’ve gotten the vac- &#8212; gotten vaccinated. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist.</p>



<p>According to the American Medical Association, over 90 percent of physicians are fully vaccinated. They&#8217;re making the choice to protect themselves and their communities and their patients. Follow their lead and make the choice for yourself.</p>



<p>As I said, we’re heading into, God willing, the summer of joy, a summer of freedom. On July 4, we’re going to celebrate our independence from the virus as we celebrate our independence of our nation. We want everyone &#8212; everyone to be able to do that.</p>



<p>Let’s remember, we are the United States of America. Let’s get this done &#8212; all of us, together.</p>



<p>God bless you all. And may God protect our troops. Thank you.</p>



<p>Q Could the Delta variant force us back into lockdown?</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT: I don&#8217;t think so because so many people have already been vaccinated, but the Delta variant can cause more people to die in areas where people have not been vaccinated. Where people have gotten the two shots, the Delta variant is highly unlikely to result in anything, other than &#8212; I mean, as &#8212; the existing vaccines are very effective.</p>



<p>So, no, it&#8217;s not a lockdown, but some areas will be very hurt.</p>



<p>Q Sir, any comment about (inaudible) what the Catholic Bishops have done? Are you concerned about this rift within the Catholic Church? And are you concerned about this action?</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT: Say again.</p>



<p>Q The Catholic Bishops are moving on this resolution that would prevent you and others who&#8217;ve supported abortion from receiving communion. Are you concerned about the rift in the Catholic Church? And how do you feel personally about that?</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT: That&#8217;s a private matter, and I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s going to happen. Thank you.</p>



<p>Q Mr. President, have you seen the infrastructure plan on Capitol Hill &#8212; the bipartisan plan? Do you have any reaction to that?</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT: I&#8217;ll tell you Monday when I get a copy of it.</p>

<p>The idea that we have held back security assistance to Ukraine is nonsense. Just last week—in the run-up to the U.S.-Russia Summit—we provided a $150 million package of security assistance, including lethal assistance. We have now provided the entire amount appropriated by Congress through the Ukraine security assistance initiative. Two days before the Summit, President Biden stood on the stage before the entire world at NATO and said that we would keep putting Ukraine “in the position to be able to continue to resist Russian physical aggression.” We have also prepared contingency funds in the event of a further Russian incursion into Ukraine. As President Biden told President Putin directly, we will stand unwavering in support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>When President Biden took office 150 days ago, more than 3,300 Americans were dying each day, more than 185,000 Americans were infected with COVID-19 cases a day, and the economy had lost millions of jobs.<br><br>Today, thanks to the President’s COVID-19 strategy, the virus is in retreat. 300 million shots have been administered in 150 days, COVID-19 cases and deaths have decreased by more than 90 percent, and the economy is experiencing the strongest rebound in decades.<br><br>This did not happen by accident. The President committed to the American people that he would confront this unprecedented challenge with the full strength and capabilities of the federal government. Each day since taking office, the President has done just that – mobilizing a whole-of-government, wartime effort to defeat COVID-19. And, he has brought all Americans, including public and private sector leaders, together and asked them to do their part.<br><br>The results are clear: America is starting to look like America again, and entering a summer of joy and freedom.<br><br><strong>300 Million Shots in 150 Days</strong><br><br>When President Biden took office, about 5% of adult Americans had gotten vaccinated. At the pace the U.S. was vaccinating in January, it would have taken 336 days to get to 300 million shots in arms. And, inadequate vaccine supply, vaccinators, and places to get vaccinated severely limited Americans’ access to vaccines.<br><br>Thanks to the Biden Administration’s whole-of-government effort to stand up a first-of-its-kind, best-in-class nationwide vaccination program, today, more than 175 million Americans have gotten at least one COVID-19 vaccine shot.</p>



<ul><li>65% of adult Americans have at least one shot, and 55% of adults are fully vaccinated.</li><li>87% of seniors and 74% of adults age 40 and over have at least one shot.</li><li>15 states and Washington, D.C., have gotten at least 70% of adults one shot.</li><li>26 states and D.C. have fully vaccinated 50% or more of adults.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Importantly, this progress on vaccinations has brought COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths down to their lowest levels since the start of the pandemic last year. It’s curbed the spread of the virus, saved tens of thousands of lives, and allowed tens of millions of Americans to get back to living their life.<br><br>This is a direct result of the Biden Administration’s whole-of-government, wartime effort that focused on:<br><br><strong>Securing enough supply for all Americans and getting it out the door as quickly as possible.</strong>&nbsp;When President Biden took office, there was not enough vaccine supply for all Americans, and states were not getting the supply allocation and delivery timeline information they requested and needed to be successful. Thanks to the President’s aggressive actions, the Biden Administration secured enough supply for all Americans, dramatically increased supply to states, and gave states more visibility into allocation numbers to allow for better planning to get shots into arms much faster. This allowed the President to make all adults eligible for vaccination in mid-April – months ahead of expectations – and has positioned the U.S. to help lead the global efforts to vaccinate the world.<br><br><strong>Mobilizing Americans to get shots in arms.</strong>&nbsp;The Biden Administration has deployed over 9,000 federal personnel to support vaccinations, including over 5,100 active duty troops. A total of 2,500 federal staff have served as vaccinators. Thanks in part to the American Rescue Plan, the Administration has funded over 30,000 National Guard members who have supported COVID-19 response efforts in states and territories, with 2,300 National Guard members serving as vaccinators. The President also used his authority under the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act to permit additional health care providers, including retired doctors and dentists, to administer shots in arms across the country.<br><br><strong>Dramatically increasing the number of vaccination sites so that at least 90% of Americans have access to a shot within 5 miles of where they live.</strong>&nbsp;Today, with more than 81,000 vaccination sites in communities across the country, and thousands of sites offering no-appointment, walk-in vaccinations, it has never been easier to get vaccinated in America. The Biden Administration achieved this by:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Launching a federal pharmacy vaccination program and expanding it to 42,000 local pharmacies that have administered more than 82 million shots in arms. </strong>More than 75% of these pharmacies are offering no-appointment, walk-in vaccinations, and over 5,600 are offering extended hours on Fridays in June, including many open 24 hours on these days.<br> </li><li><strong>Standing up 39 federally-run, high-volume vaccination sites in 27 states.</strong> These sites – stood up by FEMA and run in conjunction with the U.S. military and state and local partners – were all located in the most vulnerable neighborhoods in America. More than 5.6 million shots have been administered at these sites.<br> </li><li><strong>Launching a community health center vaccination program and expanding it to about 1,100 centers that have administered almost 5 million shots. </strong>Two-thirds of the population that these centers serve are living at or below the federal poverty line and 60% are racial and/or ethnic minorities. More than 70% of shots administered through the program have gone to racial and ethnic minorities, and these centers have hosted almost 11,000 pop-up clinics to reach the most vulnerable communities.<br> </li><li><strong>Meeting people where they are.</strong> The Biden Administration has supported more than 20,000 community-based pop-up vaccination clinics, including through FEMA, Veterans Affairs, and the pharmacy and community health center programs. These clinics, which have gotten over 3.6 million shots in arms, meet people where they are, including at places of work, worship, and recreation.<br> </li><li><strong>Providing funding, equipment and/or personnel to help states expand and scale up their own vaccination efforts. </strong>Thanks in part to the American Rescue Plan, the Biden Administration has provided over $4.8 billion in funding to 57 states, localities, Tribes and territories to support and increase their vaccination efforts. In total, FEMA has provided critical support to over 2,200 community vaccination centers nationwide.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Advancing equity.</strong>&nbsp;The Biden Administration has put equity at the center of every aspect of its response, including its vaccination program. More than 70% of the shots provided to community health centers through the federal program have been administered to people of color and more than 58% of the shots administered at federally-run sites have gone to people of color. More than 40% of pharmacies participating in the federal program are located in high-risk zip codes, and pharmacies have conducted over 8,100 pop-up vaccination clinics to support vaccination of essential workers and other communities disproportionately impacted by COVID-19. And, in the past month alone, people of color have accounted for 54% of nationwide vaccinations, while only making up 40% of the U.S. population. The Biden Administration is also:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Investing in community health centers.</strong>&nbsp;The Administration has invested more than $6 billion in American Rescue Plan (ARP) funding in Community Health Centers to expand access to COVID-19 vaccines, testing, and treatment for vulnerable populations<br>&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Bolstering the response in rural communities.</strong>&nbsp;The Administration has provided nearly $860 million in ARP funding to help rural health clinics and rural hospitals broaden their COVID-19 testing and mitigation to slow the spread of the virus in their communities; and $100 million in ARP funding to approximately 4,600 rural health clinics across the country to support vaccine outreach in rural communities.<br>&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Combatting COVID-19 in Indian Country.</strong>&nbsp;The Administration has invested nearly $6 billion in ARP funding to support Tribal communities in their fight against the virus, including $600 million for the Indian Health Service to increase vaccinations.<br>&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Building vaccine confidence in the hardest-hit and highest-risk communities.</strong>&nbsp;The Administration has provided $3 billion to expand vaccination outreach to underserved communities through the CDC and another $1 billion to help build vaccine confidence.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Ensuring getting vaccinated is easy and convenient and that the American people have the information and confidence they need to get vaccinated.</strong>Thanks in part to the ARP, the Biden Administration has provided more than $4 billion to state and local health agencies, national, community- and faith-based organizations to conduct vaccine education and outreach efforts in communities across the country and build Americans’ confidence in the vaccines. In addition, the Administration has worked with the private and public sector to provide Americans free transportation to and from vaccine sites, increase the availability of no-appointment, walk-in vaccinations, and promote paid time-off and free child care for vaccinations, and much more. &nbsp;These efforts have paid off: At the beginning of this year, only 34% of Americans wanted to get vaccinated as soon as possible. Five months later, we not only increased that number dramatically, the Biden Administration has vaccinated 65% of adults.<br><br><strong>WHAT AMERICANS WERE READING IN JANUARY</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>Like so many fathers, my dad was a man of decency, honor, generosity, and kindness. &nbsp;He had a profound impact on me, and instilled in me the understanding of the basic truth that everyone is entitled to be treated with dignity and respect. &nbsp;The value set my father taught me, I taught to my children and&nbsp;my grandchildren. &nbsp;I hold his words, his wisdom, and his influence in my heart every day and every time I sign my name as&nbsp;President, Joseph R. Biden, Jr.</p>



<p>Father&#8217;s Day is a time to recognize, appreciate, and celebrate the fathers and father figures in our lives who lift us up on their shoulders and shape our lives for the better.&nbsp; We thank the dads who have guided, taught, coached, cared for us, and supported us through life&#8217;s trials and tribulations. &nbsp;And, we celebrate all that they impart: &nbsp;character and perspective, lessons borne from experience, and the sacrifices made from love.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We also know this can be a hard day for many &#8212; for those who have lost a father, a grandfather, a stepfather, or a fatherly role model; and for those fathers who have lost a child of their own.&nbsp; During the past year, too many families lost fathers too soon because of and during this pandemic.&nbsp; We think of&nbsp;them today and every day, and we honor their enduring memories and legacies.</p>



<p>My Administration is committed to strengthening American families and easing the burdens of caregiving, so that more fathers and mothers can raise children while pursuing fulfilling lives and careers of their own.&nbsp; The American Families Plan would provide 12 weeks of paid family leave, so that all parents who work outside the home can spend precious time with their newborn children or care for their children and other loved ones&nbsp;when they get sick.&nbsp; By investing in our caregiving infrastructure, we can help ensure that no father or mother has to choose between putting food on the table or caring for their children.&nbsp; My Administration is also committed to helping single moms and dads, many of whom shoulder all of the parenting responsibility in their children&#8217;s lives, sacrificing greatly to&nbsp;ensure that their kids have the same opportunities as everyone else.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, we express our appreciation for the fathers, stepfathers, grandfathers, and father figures who enrich our&nbsp;character, love us unconditionally, and give so much of themselves every day so we can live lives worthy of their dreams&nbsp;and sacrifices. &nbsp;</p>



<p>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, in accordance with a joint resolution of the Congress approved April 24, 1972, as amended (36 U.S.C. 109), do hereby proclaim June 20, 2021, as Father&#8217;s Day.&nbsp; I&nbsp;direct the appropriate officials of the Government to display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings on this day.&nbsp; Let us remember our fathers, living and deceased, and&nbsp;give them the honor and gratitude they deserve.</p>



<p>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighteenth day of June, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-fifth.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-right">JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.</p>
